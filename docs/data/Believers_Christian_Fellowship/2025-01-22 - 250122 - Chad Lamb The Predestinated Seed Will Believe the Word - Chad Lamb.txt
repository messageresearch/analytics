I know the Lord has made a way for me amen God bless you this evening let's bow our heads together Lord Jes Jesus we're thankful once again to be standing here Lord for the privilege of coming to hear your word Lord we're so thankful so appreciate you drawing us together once again Lord As we sing your praises and declare your goodness now as we look into your word we pray you would help us Lord by

through these lips I pray we give ourselves to you Lord both speaker and hearer we trust in you and we we're looking longing to hear what you have for us tonight we ask that you would be blessed in it all in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all while we're standing this evening let's just take our Bibles and turn to the Book of John John chapter 4 and say it's good to have brother Gabe and his family back we're glad they made it back safe up in the Cleveland area and I've asked brother Gabe to take the Sunday service for us this Sunday so we were getting a little envious he's been preaching for everybody else we thought we have a right too amen so we've asked him to take the service and he he agreed so he'll be doing that amen it's good to see you all here I'm glad you all are not fren amen it's been nice and cold but God's been good amen nice and warm in here so we thank God for that amen let's look at John chapter 4 verse 46 John 4:46 it says so Jesus came again into canaa of Galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernium when he heard that Jesus was was come out of Judea into Galilee he went unto him and besought him that he should come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death then said Jesus unto him except you see signs and wonders you will not believe the noble man saith unto him sir come down air my child die Jesus said unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way and as he was now going down his servant met him and told him saying thy son liveth then inquired he of of them the hour when he began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him so the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed in his whole house amen God be praised may you have your seats now and may God bless us as we look into his word I want to highlight a few things in this uh before we move on to another scripture I I I want to go back up to verse 48 when the man asked Jesus to come and heal his son who is at the point of death then Jesus said unto him except you see signs and wonders you will not believe man that's a uh interesting thing brother benam says or Jesus says because uh this man comes and says will you heal my son who's now at the point of death and his response to that is except you see signs and wonders you will not believe he wanted him to come and lay hands on him or do what whatever he would do pray for him and raise up his son and this is Jesus's response and whenever I see a response like this it's always curious to me why he responds his way there's something that that Jesus is addressing there's something that he's understanding he's wanting to highlight and and make visible and this man says come down and heal my son come down and heal my son for he was at the point of death then said Jesus unto him except you see signs and wonders you should not believe then the noble man addresses him again he says unto him sir come down he my child die and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that Jesus said unto him that Jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way this is the most critical part of the whole thing to me amen he says come down and heal my son and Jesus said unless you see a a miracle or a sign you'll not believe and he says please come down and heal my son a he die and he says thy son liveth he he didn't do what the man said the man saying come down and heal my son physically come to the scene physically come and show up and do something that I can see that you lay hands you can pray you come to my house amen and you heal my son and and and Jesus says that's unless you see a sign or a wonder you won't even believe but the man implored again please come down he he die and Jesus said thy son liveth in the next verse the man believed the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way and as he went then his servant comes and he begins to tell him hey your son's alive and he questions him what hour amen was he made better he said the seventh hour just like in the seventh age the seventh hour and he realized amen he realized it was the same hour in which Jesus says thy son liveth and so now he realized that it was the word that did it it wasn't it wasn't Jesus coming physically on the scene but when he spoke the word he believed the word and it was the word that did the work and his faith in the word and when he when he caught and in the seventh hour it was the spoken word amen that did the healing then he realized and he believed you Lord praise God Amen we could take that so so to where we're at today amen cuz so many times when we have a problem we say God come down would you come down and heal us will you come down and deliver will you come down come down what do we mean by come down where is he amen what we need is Faith in his word praise God Almighty amen for a subject tonight I'd like to just take the the predestinated seed will believe the word and you'll see as we go through why we started with this scripture and what meant so much to me oh if we could just get the same if we could come to the same place amen where When God says it we believe it it's done we don't need anything else in the in the message brother BR says in the message the angel in the commission from back in 1950 he talks about the angel of the Lord coming to him and he could feel the presence of the Angel when he went to prayer and he makes this statement he said I knew it was still there but I didn't know why I waited I guess 5 minutes passed I felt it moving closer to me and when it did I just heard the voice sound like way back I could not personate the voice if I had to but I heard it just as plain and audible as my voice is to you said you're confining too much of that gift of healing to perform Miracles it will come to pass that people will not believe you unless there's a miracle performed so this was the warning of the Angel of the Lord to the prophet he says now and brother brandham he talks about this in several places and I mentioned it to you the time we ministered before that brother bam and his campaign managers were having Miracle lines and they were bringing the wor and they said we want the worst cases you got bring them through first and we want things that are visible we want de we want those in wheelchairs we want that's what we want and what they were what the attempt was the attempt was that if people see the Miracles amen they'll believe right and so that's that's why they had adapted uh adapted that practice amen that's why they began to do the miracle lines and God warned him and after God warned him brother bham still did one we spoke of this before and it was disastrous he did a miracle line amen and and and he prayed for a little girl that was hard of hearing she went completely deaf yeah prayed for a man that was hard of hearing he went completely deaf and brother M knew he was wrong he had to go and repent because this was the warning he had and what was God doing God was trying to break that wrong understanding and the wrong understanding is if they see Miracles they'll believe but what the angel was telling him is you're training the people to only believe if they see a miracle yeah not to just take it based on the word amen just because his word says but now unless there's a miracle performed the people won't believe unless there's a miracle performed and that was the warning of the Angel and that's what Jesus also said let's go to Matthew 16 Matthew 16 verse 1 says the Pharisees also with Sadducees came with the Sadducees came tempting Desiring him that he would show them a sign from Heaven he answered and said unto them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh you Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall be no sign be given unto it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas and he left them and departed and so they ask for a sign and Jesus won't give them a sign they want a sign amen but Jesus knows these are the Pharisees and Sadducees he knows that he can give them a sign but a sign won't cause them to believe yes that a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and none will be given them but the sign of Jonas what was the sign of Jonas death and Resurrection amen Jonas was in the belly of the whale and he resurrected and he went and preached but the sign of Jonas was not just the resurrection from the dead it was also going and preaching to the Gentiles and seeing the Gentiles believe and that was the sign that was given to that Wicked and adulterous generation they wanted they wanted to see a sign in order to believe or they they were we're going to make Jesus prove by signs amen that what he said was true and they said you can't even discern the season that you're in you can discern natural things but you can't even discern spiritual things because it's already been declared to you the season that we're in so what will a sign do for you nothing man let's go back in to Exodus so I just want to lay those scriptures down as a foundation for where we want to go let's go into Exodus now and look at the life of Moses for just just a little bit Exodus chap 4 Exodus chapter 4 and verse one this is Moses on the back side of the desert he's he's speaking to God out of the burning bush and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken into my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob hath appeared unto thee and the Lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand in thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as the other flesh and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land so Moses now going down to the children of Israel he's going down because it's the time of Deliverance he's going down because God has given him a message to deliver to them that now it's time to go take the promise and as he goes amen God calls him down and he says they won't believe me and so God says so that they'll know that you met God so that they'll know that you're that you're my mouthpiece I will give you a sign and he told him to throw the rod down and he did and he told him to pluck his hand into his bosom and pull it out it was leprous and he did it again it was white as snow and then he gave him a third sign if they don't believe those two that he would pour water out of the river onto dry ground and it would turn blood so God gave these three signs and what were the signs to do the signs were to vindicate Moses yeah they were to vindicate Moses that Moses had met God and that Moses had a message from God that's what the signs were to do it was a Vindication that Moses had met God on the back side of the desert amen because Moses anybody can come out and said I met God yeah time for deliverance but God would vindicate that this is my mouthpiece I sent him and I gave him a message now hear his message amen and and so I want to look at a couple more scriptures and then let's go to one more uh Exodus 14 Exodus 14 and 29 we know that Moses went to Israel showed the signs uh uh obeyed the Lord brought the plagues uh got the Deliverance LED them out with a mighty hand then they found themselves at the banks of the Red Sea with the Moses's or with Pharaoh's Army coming down upon them and and we'll pick up the story in verse 29 uh 14:29 but the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the Sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore and Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians and the people feared the Lord and believed the Lord and his servant mother Moses I think I'd believe too they they they had just went through the 10 plagues they had seen uh uh Egypt wiped out they were affected by the first several plagues but then after that they saw that there was a separation between Goan and a separation between the Egyptians and then they were preserved under the shed blood and the atonement of an innocent lamb under the last plague and then they were sent out and they had spoiled Egypt and they they took all the gold and all the vessels and all the garments and that they could carry and they went out amen as a mighty conquering Army and they saw all of this through the servant Moses and knew that it was God working through this man then they get to a a tight spot when they get pinched in against the against the water against the sea and against the cliffs and the army of pharaoh coming down to destroy them and they see the pillar of fire go and stand between them and the enemy to to hold them back amen and then then Moses reaches forth his hand with the rod and the Red Sea parts right down the midle and stands up as a wall on either side and they all walk down into the water not on soggy moist ground that had been covered by water for how many hundreds or thousands years amen but they walked across on dry ground right and as they walked across the wall the water was a wall on their left hand and a wall on their right hand they could look right into the water and sometimes I wonder you know as a child I wonder could they see fish right yeah they were looking right they were looking into the Red Sea standing on dry ground and a wall on either side and they come out the other side two million people pass through amen and then the pillar of fire removed and then Pharaoh's Army came down and they saw the sea when when Pharaoh extended his arms again the sea crash back down and wipe out the Egyptian Army and they belied the Lord and they believed Moses there's no way you couldn't uhhuh yes yeah well let's go to Exodus 16 this is approximately a month later 30 some days later and they took their Journey 16 verse1 they took their Journey from Elum and all the congregation of the children of Israel came into the Wilderness of sin which is between Elum and Si on the 15th day of the 2 month after their depart departure out of the land of Egypt and the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and the children of Israel said unto them would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the fool for you have brought us forth into this Wilderness to kill this whole assembly with Hunger I thought they believed the Lord and Moses after walking through the Red Sea and then all the things that led up to that event a miracle Beyond any miracle that we could think of and they're completely delivered and here 30 or 30 some days later when they're hungry and they don't have any food and all the food that they brought with them had expired had run out been consumed they tell Moses I wish to God we had died in the land of Egypt when we sat by the fleshing pots and when we that did eat bread to the fool for you have brought us forth into this Wilderness to kill this whole assembly with Hunger see what we realize very quickly here is that Miracles never produce genuine Faith it's been proved all through the scriptures yeah because they believed the Lord and they believed Moses of course they could not believe they believed Moses held his Rod out and they believed the Lord parted the waters they believe they walked on dry ground they believe they got to the other side they believed that Pharaoh's Army was consumed in the waters and died they believed all of that they didn't doubt it but here they doubted the message that Moses brought and they failed to understand that the Miracles that Moses worked were the Vindication that God gave that Moses was the mouthpiece so when Moses threw down the rod and picked it up again when Moses put his hand on his bosom pulled it out when he poured water out turned to blood and then all the plagues they were there to vindicate that Moses had the word of God so that the people would believe the words that came out of Moses's mouth and they believed all all the signs and all the Wonders but they failed to believe the words more signs wouldn't have helped these people more wonders wouldn't have helped these but you can't do anymore what more could you do they don't need more signs they don't need more wonders they don't need more what they need is faith in the word of God and that's what they did not have they had faith in the Miracles they had faith in the power of God they had faith in the prophet of God but they did not have faith in the word of God because the word of God was God has come to deliver you and take you back to the land that he promised to your father Abraham yeah that was the word of the Lord and their testimony here proved they did not believe the word of the Lord but they believed all of the Miracles oh praise God what is it God wants us to believe the word right believe all of the Miracles and still missed the whole point yeah righten it's like this all through the Wilderness Journey it's terrible for poor Moses Moses goes from hero to zero to hero to zero and everything in between and and poor Moses he's dealing with he's dealing with unbelieving Believers yeah that's right believe in God believe that Moses is a prophet a servant of God believe the power of God believe the Miracles of God and they believe Moses can do it because every time they get in trouble they tell Moses to do something else because they know that the power of God resides in Moses yeah but they they through the entire Journey they proved that they did not believe Moses's message yeah Amen brother B says in the message proving his word he said only two of them believed it that was Joshua and Caleb and they brought back the evidence that the land was good but the circumstances was that was what hindered them he's talking about the other 10 because they were not able to take the land because their cities were walled their people are great Giants why we look like grasshoppers up aside of them Joshua and Caleb said we are more than able to take it why God had give it to them no matter how big the giant was they obstacle meant nothing to them God had said so and God proved it by them how did God prove it by Joshua and Caleb because later they would go in and take the land amen because they believed and they did go over and take the land and God said they would do it he proved it to them so here you had and all the company amen that had come out through the through the Wilderness Journey Through the plagues in Egypt through the signs through the Wonders through everything that happened you had two that actually believe the word of the Lord amen the other however many hundreds and hundreds of thousands and millions they believe the the power of God they believe the sign of God they believe the Wonder of God they believe the gift of God but they did not believe the word of God my goodness Amen in the Smur and church age out of the church age book brother says this they are like the children of Israel who came out of Egypt and stopped short of the promised land now now those children of Israel left Egypt about 2 million strong they all journeyed together all saw the same miracles of god all partook of the same man and water from the smitten rock all followed the same Cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night but only two reached the promised land only two were true or real Believers yeah that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter Hebrews 3 3:19 then since that is so and only two entered then the rest were not true believers what made the difference two stayed with the word when the hearts of the 10 spies failed at kades barnea Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more than able to take the land they knew they could because God had said I have given you the land how did they know listen Joshua and Caleb saw the same wall cities and the same Giants and the same armor and the same instruments of war they saw everything else that the 10 spies saw the difference was they actually believed the words that had come out of Moses's mouth were from God they actually believed the word of the Lord they actually heard the message that Moses brought not just saw the Miracles but they heard the message and they believ the message and they knew that they were able to take the land not because they themselves were able to take the land but they were able because God said he gave it to them praise God I'm going to read that again they knew they could because God had said I have given you the land after all those Israelites solve the power and goodness and deliverance of God they did not enter into rest which is a type of the Holy Ghost let's go to Hebrews 3 and actually read this reference the prophet of God referenced here Hebrews chapter 3 when I read these things and hear what the brother said I absolutely Marvel friends I Marvel because you would think listen we still think the same thing today amen we've got somebody that that we we want to believe or we we wish they would believe we just want so bad God to show them a miracle so that they'll believe amen if God shows them a miracle they may believe the miracle but the real challenge amen is to believe the word that's where the real predestinated C Gene of God will believe that word all the way through to the end they won't reject the Miracles either they'll believe the Miracles yes but they'll believe the Miracles but they believe the word am amen so in Hebrews chapter 3 verse 7 we'll start at verse 7 wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the day of provocation and the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily what is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast Until the End while it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcus carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief so what was the sin unbelief what was the sin that kept him out of the prominis land unbelief unbelief in what Moses was a prophet of God no they believed that right amen unbelief in God no they believed in God unbelief in the power of God no they beli they believed in the power of God they believ God brought them out they believed in the Miracles they believed in the signs they believed in the Wonders they believed that they passed through the Red Sea yeah right they believed that they drank water from the rock they believe that God provided Mana every morning they believed that the quail came out of the air they belied that when they looked to the Brazen serpent they were healed from the snake bite they believed all of that y amen yet they sinned through unbelief yeah what was the sin of unbelief it was kades Baria when they did not believe that they could take the land yep listen if you and I as beings were standing there looking at the wall cities the Giants and the Armament and all that we wouldn't believe we could take the land either amen so let's not be too hard on the 10 spies I mean we would be the same way I mean here we are we're slaves just a little while before marching now through the Wilderness being kept by the power of God but no armor no armorment no no training no anything you were just slaves you knew how to make bricks and do whatever else the Egyptians had you doing and now you've got to organize yourself into some Army and take the land with the walled cities with with Giants and everything else in the land amen if you would look at it with natural eyes with natural ability you would come to the same conclusion I cannot do this that's why Joshua and Caleb had to have a different heart in them they had to have a heart of a predestinated c Gene of God with the capacity inside them by the faith that was gifted to them by the father God to believe that what God Said was true and they believed it because Moses said it amen but they believed Moses cuz Moses was Vindicated by the signs and the Wonders yeah amen cuz that was the purpose of the signs and the Wonders was to vindicate Moses is the mouthpiece of God and these two believed amen I should say this way they believe the purpose of the signs and the Wonders so all that God did to one generation of people to one people you think about this uh H uh large multitude of people that came out of Egypt and and everything that they witnessed firsthand the manner they chewed and tasted the water they drank the sea they walked in the midst of the army they saw destroyed the the quail that they were provide everything I mean it's absolutely unbelievable friends it's it's it's off the charts for one group of people one generation to see that much Supernatural and at the end of it all they all died in the wilderness because of unbelief right yeah my my my I said God I'm a Believer help me God help me to look to the right thing let's go to uh John chapter 20 John chapter 20 John chapter 20 and let's go to verse 24 but Thomas one of the 12 called dimus was not with them when Jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the Lord but he said unto them except I shall see in his hands the print of his nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side I will not believe and after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said Peace be unto you then saith he unto Thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and Thomas answered and said to him my Lord and my God Jesus say unto him Thomas because thou Hast seen me thou Hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed so here's a question I'll ask you it's not fair because I already read the scripture and you know too much but just to ask a question which would you in your Humanity say was more blessed to touch the prince of his hands and believe or never have seen the nail scarred body in belief what did Jesus say where the blessing was he said blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe amen so praise God we're among the blessed but we in our in our Humanity we think it would be better yes I would I would if if I would see that I would never disbelieve what about walking through two walls of water on dry ground when the Red Sea parted I would never disbelieve what about seeing a man Smite a rock and see water gushing out enough to to to water two million people plus their cattle yeah yeah I would never disbel listen there's been a lot of people that were in brother benham's meetings and saw the Supernatural and disbelieved there are those who grew up in this message and grew up in the Tabernacle and knew the stories firsthand and talked to the people had witnessed it and know that it's nothing but the truth and they disbelieve yeah seeing more miracles won't make you a Believer having the C Gene of God inside is what makes you a Believer the gift of God Amen by grace are we saved through faith and not none of ourselves it is the gift of God the ability to believe the word of God comes as a gift from God Amen because it's part of God and God will believe his own word that's right but we can wish for miracles all day long and push for miracles all day long and miracles will not make more Believers amen that's right amen it it will not create more Believers it never has it will attract attention of the True Believers it'll get them to come but remember they're not hooked by the bait on the hook they're hooked by the hook under the bait amen and that hook is the word of God Amen the truth of God the revelation of God Amen let's go to Luke 16 Luke 16 verse 27 this is The Story of Lazarus and the rich man Lazarus goes to at the death Lazarus goes to Abraham's bosom and the rich man amen goes into hell and he and he's imploring Abraham and now we go to verse uh chapter 16: 27 then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my father's house who does he want to send to his father's he want to send Lazarus the beggar that begged at his footsteps that he's at his doorstep that he stepped over who's now in the bosom of Abraham and he find himself in hell and now he's asking Father Abraham please send him back to my father's house for I have five Brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of Torment Abraham saith unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them and he said nay Father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent and he said unto them if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded the one rose from the dead right because Miracles don't make Believers right amen John chapter 5 Miracles are a Vindication and an Evidence of the work of God John chapter 5 in John chapter 5 I want to start at verse 45 sayso not think that I will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even Moses in whom you trust for he for had ye believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me well that's a statement because they were all claiming they believed Moses and the reality is they believed Moses was a prophet of God they believe Moses was the vessel that God used to bring the Exodus out of Egypt they believe that they believe Moses wrote the pentiuk they believe Moses got the law they believe Moses had the the the the Ten Commandments on the two tables of stone they believe Moses got the vision for the Tabernacle they believed all of that but they did not believe Moses's words yeah amen that's what he said for had you believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote a to me but if you believe not his writings how shall you believe my words Jesus is saying well I don't expect you to believe me you can't believe me you don't even believe what Moses said yeah because Moses wrote of me and you won't believe what Moses was saying y that's the same thing that happened in The Exodus they believed Moses but they didn't believe moses' words yeah they didn't believe that what he said they didn't believe the message that he had brought from God but they believed Moses they could see him they could see him hold up the rod they could see him throw it down and become certain they could take it back up they knew he was a mighty prophet of God they knew that that God was using him they believed in Moses but they did not believe Moses's message my oh my and here he is Generations later Here Comes Jesus Christ which is the Fulfillment of what Moses had said and Moses wrote of him and he's standing here the word made flesh and he's saying how are you going to believe me if you won't believe Moses because Moses wrote of me if you won't believe his writings why will you believe my words it shows where true faith is Friends true faith is in the present day word of the Lord amen that's where true faith lies is those who can believe the present tense word of the Lord and the message as I was with Moses brother banham is telling the story of how in the cabin that day he got his commission from the angel of the Lord and he says but he told me that he would give me when I told him that the people would not believe me how would a king or Monarch an educated person he had been told you're going to go take a gift of healing to the peoples of the world and you're going to pray for Great Men and monarchs and kings and and and leaders and and you're going to travel all over and brother man saying but no one's going to believe me how would a king or a monarch or an educated person most of them that looks to the wisdom of the world and the talents of that type listen to a man that that that talked like me they would not do that and so I said they won't believe me he said as as the prophet Moses was given two signs to vindicate his being sin of God so will you be given now that was something not in the educational realm but out in the Supernatural realm see and said the first thing you'll know to diseases by taking people by the hand and then it'll come to pass that you'll know the very secrets of their hearts and the things that's happened in their life and be able to tell them from the beginning to the end and said they'll believe this is that right yes that's right so as Moses was given sign two signs he was given two signs he was given the sign in the hand and he was given the sign of discernment and the angel of the Lord said they'll believe this and that's the truth they believe the sign in the hand and they believe the discernment yeah right but many of them didn't believe the messag amen and what was the point of the sign of the hand and what was the point of the sign of discernment to vindicate the messenger to vindicate that God sent him so people would listen to him so that they would get the word of the Lord and they could believe the word that comes out of his mouth so the signs were given to him to vindicate that he was sin of God praise God so the Vindication is important but what's more important is the message amen let's go to John chapter 12 John 12 verse 44 John 12:44 Jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me I am come a light un the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not for I come not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day for I have not spoken of myself but the Father which sent me ha given me Commandment that I should say and what I should speak and now I know that this command and his life Everlasting whatsoever I speak therefore even as the father said unto me so I speak so even Jesus is saying amen I've done signs I've done wonders I've done Miracles but you're going to be judged by the words that I speak yeah because the word that I speak is not mine but it's the father's who gave me to speak I only speak what he gave me to speak so Jesus was sent with a messag amen and they were judged on whether or not they believed his message yeah multitudes believed his healing campaigns multitudes Hey listen thousands of people believe that he broke bread and fish yeah because they ate it right they ate the bread they ate the fish that was multiplied over little fishes and a few little loaves a handful amen and a small basket and it it fed multitudes of 5,000 men Bes besides women and children and they actually ate it and swallowed it they knew he had the power to break bread and multiply they knew he was a man sent from God that's that's what Nicodemus said we know that thou are a man sent from God for no man can do these Miracles lest he be sent of God they believed he had power they believed he was a great prophet they believed but they didn't believe his words and they were judged not whether they believed the Miracles or not they judged whether they believed his word or not why because it was the father's word amen in the message what hearest thou brother benam says he says what hearest thou what can you hear and what have you heard through the years we've had Miracles we've had things that God has had men to wait he's performed Miracles he's never it never changed the country sin is on the Rampage worse than it ever was it moved right into the locks of the church and has tore it up what did our miracles do what did our healing campaigns I believe in Divine Healing sure but but you can't major on a minor Divine Healing is a minor you could never major on those things the church ought to be to maturity and we've had rushing winds and we've had all kinds of Sensations where's the church at where are we at today still more denominations growing every day and colonizing and everything and still the same men what we need is to wait till we hear the voice of God as individuals guess this he's typing it with Elijah in the cave and and Elijah is running away from his commission running scared he's back in the cave amen hiding out and God comes to him and and he speaks to him and and Elijah has excuses we know but then you know then there's a a great fire then a great wind and a great earthquake and God wasn't in any of it but then there was a still small voice and the still Small Voice had a message for Elijah and that message for Elijah through the still Small Voice it's what caused him amen the the fire didn't move him the earthquake didn't move him amen the wind didn't move him but the still soul Small Voice got him to come out of the back of the cave and how did he come out he came out in humility with his face wrapped in his mantle yeah cuz God was dealing with Elijah and that still Small Voice called him out and gave him his commission and his position and the work that he had to do Amen brother B says he's he's talking he's talking to a a World Church system he's talking in campaign aigns amen where there's been a Pentecostal Revival or restoration of the gifts from isusa Street on then there's been healing campaigns that broke out in the late 40s and tent revivals and meetings that swept uh uh after World War II and swept for a decade amen and he went through all of that and he says what have we got are the churches any better have the men changed what what have we got he says what we need is to wait till we hear the voice of God as an individual every man and woman in this convention no matter of Jim Jones and the rest of them that's that's that's with you if they don't do it you do it anyhow you pull yourself back in a cave and wait there until God speaks to you don't you move he will do it see to me this is this is amazing there was let's just go back to the Exodus Journey signs wonders Miracles powerful manifestations yeah and all of them heard what Moses said but only two of them receive the message because receiving the message is not hearing it with these ears receiving the message is receiving it with a receiving Crystal on the inside that knows that that's nothing but the truth and how did they know it was nothing but the truth cuz they were willing to do the word yeah they were willing to live the word word they were willing to manifest the word how were they live willing to do the word they were willing to go fight Giants and climb walls on walled cities because they believe the message yeah how did they believe it listen everybody heard the voice of Moses declaring what God's message was but two received the message they got the voice of God individually yeah Amen to them they knew they could do it they knew they could take it they knew the Pro was to them so much so that Caleb after 40 years he was 40 years old when he went to spy out the land 40 years old when he stealed them 40 years old when he said we can do it God said we can do it and then he had to wait another 40 years till all the unbelievers who died because of the sin of unbelief we're separated from the camp then he comes to Moses and now he's 80 years old he said 40 years and he was he was over 80 40 plus years he said I'm waited I'm just as strong today yeah to go out and to come in he says give me my Mountain amen what he what's he saying I heard God speak to me that promise was to me it wasn't a general message to everybody out there he heard a whisper in his heart that that land was his land that promise was his promise and he was and God says I've come he said it through Moses's voice but he Vindicated Moses as the voice right Moses had the vindication that he'd been on the backs side of the desert he met God was commissioned by God to bring a message and he came out and showed the signs that God wanted him to show to vindicate that he was the mouthpiece of God so it wasn't Moses's message it was God's messag amen amen and God's message found its home and two people everybody else heard what Moses said that day but there was two that received the message amen and here Caleb is after a 40-year delay yeah and he still knows what he heard while he was in Egypt is still the truth yeah right because What mo what here's what Caleb heard or here's what he didn't hear I'm taking a group of people over to the promised land and I'm taking a group of people and I'm giving them the promised land yeah right right no that's not what Caleb heard what Caleb heard is I'm calling you out of Egypt and I'm taking you to the promise of your fathers and I'm giving that land to you yeah amen that's what the crystal of predestinated seed picks up not the general message the individual message to you it's you I've promised this to you Caleb couldn't die amen he had already received the message it was to him he knew that God had told him I'm going to bring you out with a mighty hand I'm going to give you to take you to the promise that I promised to your fathers and I'm going to give you this land listen that's how we've got to hear this message friends amen we've got to hear it it's got to speak to the crystal the seed Amen to the real us down on the inside and it doesn't matter how long we wait or what we see or how many Compadres die in the wilderness it does not matter because I heard the message to me it was to me amen there's been all kinds of revivals and all kinds of meetings and all kinds of camps and all kinds of doctrin and they sweep through and everybody gets excited then it dies off and then another one sweeps and it dies off and great ministry and what it doesn't matter how long that goes on I heard something to me that this message is to me the body Chang is for me the calling out of Leo deia was for me the stepping through an open door and taking another position with my Lord that was for me doesn't matter doesn't matter amen and all the sweeping revivals and all the big moves and all the great camps and all the big doctrines what's It produced God already Vindicated the mouthpiece was the prophet of God and that mouthpiece of God come to bring God's message and God's message came to connect with individuals the the first pull the second pull what was it brother man begins to to to talk about he goes back to the vision of the three pools when he's fishing and it begins the whole vision and the whole purpose of the Vision was to catch the rainbow trout out in the deep water the Covenant fish Rainbow's a sign of the Covenant there's Covenant fish there's big rainbow trout laying out there he said in the deep water so I just thought to myself I think I can catch them of course he can catch him he was ordained to catch him and the first pole in the vision was a pool with a lure amen that was the sign in the hand brother bam relates it all to us it was a sign in the hand and what was it to do it was to attract attention he trying to get those Covenant fish to come to the word so he throws out there the sign in the hand and it attracts he said a bunch of little fish gather around well when those little fish gather around that gets attention to the big fish they rise off the bottom they start watching and seeing what's going on then the second pool amen was supposed to what it was supposed to do is scatter all the little fish and cause the big fish to come closer and the third pool was supposed to catch them but in brother R's second pull the discernment he pulled too hard and when he pulled too hard he caught one little old bitty fish he said it looked like skin Over The Lure he said that was the same kind of fish these other brothers was cing along the bank well all the brothers along the bank were other ministers so what was the first and second pool it was an attraction and a lot more got attracted than just the rainbow trout yeah it attracted other species of fish it attracted the little fish like the other it attracted all kinds of fish because that was the purpose to attract the fish but the third pull was when he set the hook and at the third pool the rainbow trout were hooked they were never going to get away they were going to make it all the way in Shore because they were hooked on the third pool and brother B said the third pool was the opening of the word brother M go now he he makes some comments let me see if I can jump to another page Lord and see a few things he made brother bam said in anointed ones in the end times he says not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message the first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more no more there is any more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it that's the million-dollar question yeah do you see it but I like when he says not when he begins but when he begins to declare his message so there was a time that he began to declare his message he he says in works as Faith expressed he says Revelation 10 said that in the hour of the seventh Angel's message when he begins to sound forth his message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service so we begin to realize and he says that in more than one place but we'll just leave it at that what brother B is telling us is there was an attraction but that attraction was attracting all kinds of fish and that can represent the church at Large attracting everybody that's in the pond you know y but but the third pool the one that was supposed to catch the big trout in the deep water the Covenant fish that third pool that was supposed to catch them was the opening of the word amen and the opening of the word was not a healing campaign a sign or a Wonder or or water from a rock like anything that's visible or tangible but the third pool came in a way that brother bham said I feel checked not to say any more I'm told I'm not to explain this one you explain the first one you explain the second one but you won't explain the third one when it starts it'll be a total secret amen so what's supposed to catch the rainbow trout it's going to be the message that comes after the healing campaigns not the healing campaigns that's the attraction to attract all the fish but what's supposed to catch those predestinated what was it amen that caught what was it that caught Caleb and and and and and Joshua amen I'm of course they were excited about the Miracles of course they were excited about the destruction of Egypt I I bet they were as excited as everybody else was excited amen when they walk through the Red Sea I don't know about you but I would be thrilled to have an experience like that yeah thrilled I bet they were as excited as everybody else was excited they were thrilled amen when they saw water come from the rock they were thrilled with the man every morning they probably talked like everybody else talked can you believe what just happened can you believe what we just saw I mean I this is absolutely amazing I've never heard of anything like this in the history of the world Amen everybody was attracted but there was something else that was deeper in those two they believed everything else everybody believed but they believed more because they believ the message and when it come to KES barnea and they moved through into cage Baria and they saw the physical hindrances to the word when they saw the cities and the Giants and this and that and the other 10 of them's heart failed for fear two of them said did you see the size of Those Grapes yeah right oh yeah 10 said did you see the size of those Gates the other said yeah those are the biggest cluster of grapes I didn't say grapes I said Gates he go I didn't notice the gates I was looking at the grapes because two believe the message 10 didn't believe the message they believe the messenger they believe the power of God they believe the signs and wonders at the end of it all they didn't believe the message cuz when it came time to take the land he said you take it you'll fight you'll fight for every in you fight you take I'll be with you I'll D but you fight amen amen and they just couldn't see how what we need we've had rushing winds we've had all kinds of sensation and where's the church at I'm going back to this quote from 59 what here's the Elijah what we need is to wait till we hear the voice of God as individuals every man woman in this convention no matter Jim Jones the rest of them that's that's with you if they don't do it you do it anyhow pull yourself back in a little cave and wait there till God speaks to you don't you move he'll do it the problem with the faith that the Israelites had as long as they had water and they had food and they had security and they had safety and they had a constant stream of Supernatural things happening they they had no problem believing it's when those things stopped that they always had a problem believing in the Third Exodus brother B says the first Exodus what did he do he brought them out of a natural land to a natural land the second Exodus he brought them out from a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost now he's bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right back into the Eternal land of the Millennium and the great Hereafter same Pillar of Fire by the same anointed system the same God doing the same things and the same word declared the first one declared the second one the same word declared the second one is declared the third one and here we see it Among Us come out oh come out of this chaos come to the Living God so what's what's he coming he says come out but come what are we coming out of what was the Third Exodus to come out of man's ideas come out of denominationalism come out of traditional understanding but there's a Going In Too part of The Exodus is not just come out but now he says come to the Living God come to the word and the word word was made flesh and dwell Among Us and now he's in our flesh dwelling Among Us what are we coming out to what we're coming out of denominationalism we're coming out of traditional understanding of the scriptures and of the Gospel what are we coming to we're coming to the realization of where God wants to dwell in this day and he wants to dwell in His Bride come out and serve the Living God and Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother B says look Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what's God trying to do God's trying to come back to earth in Bride form yes under the seventh seal returning back to the church in the fullness of his glory that's this great Exodus Journey coming out but coming into what coming into being the Tabernacle that God dwells in the dwelling place we look at we look at the Giants in our land and when you look in the mirror you'll see the worst one so you can't do it I can't live this I can't be that I can't be listen we're more than able friends why are we more than able because God promised it for this hour this is the word he wants to accomplish this is the message but this isn't the message to a group of people this isn't the message that this is the message to individuals amen Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do Christ in who the bride Christ in the true church yeah Christ no he said Christ in you Christ in you I'm going to read it again I want to read it again is that okay amen Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing amen amen see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you said well brother Brandon what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see not you joined a church you shook hands you've done something different you set a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon what is brother B saying what is the New Birth the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you do we say all right I believe I got a personal revelation that Jesus Christ died on Calvary for me that is part of the Revelation but that's not what brother Brenham ends with he says it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon amen what is the Revelation that we need to climb back into a cave and stay there until God calls us out it's the Revelation that the message is all about you amen amen it's about Christ getting Dominion in your life Christ Living his life through you Christ manifesting himself through you me too but when he says you I say me and when he says you I hope you say me amen so when brother B preaches Christ as the mystery of God revealed he opens with Colossians 1 and he reads all the way till he reads to the part where it says which is Christ in you the hope of glory what was this great message that brother renham came to what was the great message that he come to bring what was the attraction what was the signs and wonders the signs and wonders Vindicated he was the voice of God for this age and they drew the attention of the fish but what was it that caught the fish it was the opening of the word it was the mystery of God being revealed and under that mystery of God was a message to the individual you're part of this it has to do with you it's something to do with Christ and you it has something to do with an invisible Union it has something to do with the dwelling place of God it has something to do with God restoring back what was lost to the church ages and has something to do with you see that's what Caleb got in the message so many people they got they played Moses's tapes and they heard what Moses said about great this and that and the other and and but when it came down to the a difficult trial when it came down to an impossibility amen they they they walked away they disbelieved what did they disbelieve they disbelieved what Caleb and Joshua were able to believe yeah and what were they able to believe they are able to believe that they were part of the promise yeah that the promise was to them and for them and they were part of it amen I read this same quote I've read this quote twice now I think I think if I remember right in the last two Services I preached but I'm going to read it again it's out of the rising of the sun says you believe that we shall rise in him we are part of him the Easter the revealed Secret Of God like it was then of life after death we are now alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true Easter seal has broken death from around me and I'm alive the Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret and now God by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in us for now we are quickened with him I say God break the seal from arest around our lives you want to pray that today God break the seal from around my life let me side in that cave till I heal your still small voice calling me out to my position to my commission amen uh Elijah wasn't much different than you know other human beings he couldn't do it the task was too much he was left alone and they sought his life and he was all alone and he was looking at all the natural things and Elijah listen Elijah had just witnessed Supernatural is that right absolutely powerful manifestation of God coming down and a in a whirlwind of Fire and Fire falling upon his altar consuming the altar the water the stones and all of it and then a tremendous Victory and then in his own Humanity amen he falls back into fear at the threat of a woman runs amen out to the Wilderness wants to die he's no better than his fathers runs into a cave amen then God comes and deals with him and what is the message that God is giving to Elijah amen the messages Elijah Don't if I could paraphrase Jesus didn't say don't worry about all those he just ignored it all yeah I've left alone they seek my life I've done this and I've tried that and now I'm here in this cave because I'm all alone they seek my life and and God's like I'm not worried about that yeah don't you worry about that yeah but there's still something for you to do to finish the commission man I believe what we need is the same thing that Caleb got a revelation that when Moses Moses is standing there talking to 600,000 men plus women and children and it's 600,000 men plus women and children he says God come to give me a message that the time for deliverance has come he's going to give you the promise of your fathers what he promised to Abraham he's going to perform now he's taking you out of here and he's taking you to give you the land that he promised yeah and everybody cheered yay we're going we're going we're going but for everybody else it was we right but for Caleb it was me yeah so that even if we would fail me would still believe that's the Revelation that I want that's the Revelation I believe God's giving us if if we fail me believes because God told me when I hear the tapes and brother bam there there's two ways to listen to the tapes you can listen to the tape and say yeah God's calling out a bride well that's true yeah God's calling out a bride and the bride's going to do this and the bride's going to do that and the bride's going to be the Tabernacle of God and the bride and the bride and the bride and the bride you can listen to the tape that way or you can listen to the tape and say God's calling me and God wants to use me and God's going to fill me and God's going to manifest himself through me and God's going to use me to do everything that he did in his first coming that's the way I want to believe the message friends amen there's that's true faith in the word of God that's been given to us more miracles can't produce that because many times when the Miracles stop people wander away but when the revelation of the word comes and it strikes a predestinated seed they'll never walk away that's right amen they'll keep pressing on and pressing on and for 40 years what did Caleb do I don't know he could have done all kinds of stuff but I think for 40 years he kept thinking I'm going to go back to that place that I saw yeah when I went over the mountain and I saw that thing and that place there I'm going back there yeah why cuz he believed it amen that's the way I want to listen to the messag amen let's go to John chapter 8 I'm going to finish with this verse musicians if you'll come brother John if you'll make your way up please John chapter 8 John chter 8:31 then Jesus uh then said Jesus to the Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen I want to continue in his word amen more than anything I want to continue in his word no matter what happens around me no M matter what we see or don't see or feel or don't feel I want to continue in his word why because the Vindication came to prove that this was a mouthpiece of God so that I would get the word and that I would believe and follow the word amen say God help me to continue in the word am and be a disciple indeed you know many of the disciples that were with Jesus didn't continue in the word yeah many of them that saw all the works saw the raising of the Dead the opening the blind's eyes even those who performed the same kind of Miracles because Judas was sent out with a Healing Ministry Judas laid hands on the sick and that they were delivered demons were subject to him he cast out demons cuz he came back testif ifying like everybody else did that he did those works but he didn't continue in the word and what what was it all for so that we would get the word and what is it we need to do continue in the word and let's all Stand Together amen I said God I thank God for this message I thank God for ears to hear I thank God listen whether it's going right or going wrong believe the word amen amen when it feels good and it doesn't feel good believe the word you realize it doesn't always feel good amen you know there's times that that that you don't feel good and there's times serving God doesn't feel good there's times believing the message doesn't feel good there's times where everything in your life seems to be falling apart there's times where everything seems to be working out what is that to thee follow thou me right have you heard the message not not not not tapes have you heard the message to you have you heard what he's been trying to get over to you without coming right out and saying it have you heard it amen have you heard it as we or have you heard it as meise God say God help me to help me God to hear what you're saying to me amen let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your word and God there's nothing we can do in ourselves to make ourselves Believers but oh God we recognize that it's your grace in our lives Lord that it's you who before the foundation of the world you knew we would be here in this hour and you knew how to attract our attention Lord you knew what would get the attention of the rainbow Trion you knew how to draw them close so they can hear your word god you drew us Lord you knew how to show us your Dynamic power you knew how to show that you were the same yesterday today and forever you knew exactly what we needed to draw near but Lord you also knew what would keep us to the end and so you gave us the truth of your word and Lord you planted inside of us a receiving Crystal a seed Gene that could pick up that word and God that message is to the individual God give us ears tune our ears our spiritual ears to hear the message to the individual God may I recognize your voice speaking to me L I recognize your Vindication I recognize your Prophet I recognize all that you did all the signs all the Wonders all the the Miracles I know it's true but God all of that was for a purpose so that I would hear your message to me God I pray that you'd strip away everything that's causing interference every other signal that's false and wrong and every fear and every everything Lord that would hinder us and may you once again speak to individuals tonight God May those that you've called to this hour that you've given a seed Gene Lord that you've that you've planted in them the faith to believe I pray God that we begin to hear the message differently may they hear you speaking directly to them may they receive it as an individual message from you to them may they recognize Lord what who they are and what you've called them to and what the message behind the message is God I pray that you would bring a Great Awakening Lord to your people God forgive us Lord for the things that we allow to distract us and take our attention and help us to remain focused on the thing that matters most Lord God no doubt there's many distractions in our lives there's many things but God there's only one thing that really matters and that's the thing that your still smalla voice has told us is our place in your economy our position and our commission God help us to stay planted in your word and help us to stay faithful to your word God I pray that as we yield ourselves to that message Lord that we come in alignment with the faith that's inside of us and we yield to it Lord that you would use us for your work that you would use each one of us individually to accomplish what you set us aside to accomplish and may you finish your work that you left for this hour may you finish it in me Lord oh I want to be the vessel that you use I heard your call and I believe I am help me to empty myself out more that you can use me more for I know that's my purpose in this end time Lord I love you I ask you bless your people watch over us as we go home Lord give us traveling mercies Lord may we go may we go with a our ears tuned up with an enthusiasm and excitement for what you're telling us and may every day be an anticipation of what
