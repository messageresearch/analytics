[15:38] we're standing if you can turn to the
[15:39] Book of Matthew thank you
[15:42] musicians Matthew we'll we'll read from
[15:45] uh chapter 10 once we get there I just
[15:48] wanted to remind you in the morning
[15:49] we've got the um Bible Believers
[15:51] Christian School Chapel service in the
[15:53] morning so appreciate your prayers for
[15:56] that and then also uh tomorrow will be
[15:59] heading uh uh up to Southern Michigan
[16:02] with all the young adults we'll be going
[16:04] up there for a weekend getaway and some
[16:06] Ministry we're doing there so we pray uh
[16:08] just ask that you keep all of us in
[16:10] prayer for traveling mercies there and
[16:12] back and and that the Lord will really
[16:13] just speak to us there and bless our
[16:15] time together also brother Benjamin cot
[16:18] will be taking the service here on
[16:19] Sunday so if you could be remembering
[16:21] him in prayer as well that would be
[16:24] wonderful and then also if you could
[16:26] pray for brother Gabe Smith he'll be
[16:27] traveling over to Pittsburgh this Sunday
[16:30] to minister for brother Jean kadeema
[16:32] there and there's been some sickness
[16:33] going through their home so just pray
[16:34] that God will touch them all give them
[16:36] strength and I told him there must be a
[16:38] good service coming cuz a lot of
[16:40] resistance is usually a good sign so we
[16:43] just pray that the Lord will use our
[16:44] brother there mightily then there's one
[16:47] more thing I wanted to let you know that
[16:49] sister Jade Lynn is now in a place that
[16:52] she can receive mail so we took her
[16:55] address and we put it on all the
[16:56] bulletin boards so if you'd like to send
[16:58] her a letter or card she would really
[17:00] love to hear from you and it would be
[17:01] encouraging to her so that all that
[17:03] information is on the bulletin boards
[17:05] and so we we trust that God will bless
[17:07] her amen through US amen before we're
[17:11] seated let's read here in Matthew
[17:13] chapter
[17:14] 10 and we're going to read from verse 37
[17:17] Matthew
[17:20] 10 and verse
[17:25] 37 he that loveth father or mother more
[17:28] than me is not worthy of me and he that
[17:31] loveth son or daughter more than me is
[17:33] not worthy of me and he that taketh not
[17:36] his cross and follow after me is not
[17:39] worthy of me he that findeth his life
[17:42] shall lose it and he that loseth his
[17:44] life for my sake shall find iten God
[17:48] bless you as you have your seats may the
[17:50] Lord bless us as we look at his word God
[17:52] bless you brother Paul and sister norgan
[17:54] it's good to have you back with us good
[17:56] to see you there amen we're expecting
[17:59] extra pool tonight from the two of you
[18:02] amen you've been gone for a while so you
[18:04] got to make up for it brother three
[18:06] times is hard amen so I've been
[18:10] meditating on this scripture for a while
[18:12] the Lord just dropped it in my heart and
[18:13] I've been meditating on it and thinking
[18:15] about it and and I and I want to
[18:17] understand it a little bit better so I
[18:18] started looking into it and it was
[18:21] astonishing he says he that loveth
[18:24] father or mother more than me is not
[18:26] worthy of me
[18:29] amen and he that loveth son or daughter
[18:32] more than me is not worthy of me and he
[18:35] that taketh not his cross and followeth
[18:37] after me is not worthy of me and he
[18:39] keeps using this term worthy of me and
[18:41] worthy of me and I started thinking how
[18:43] in the world can we ever be worthy
[18:46] anyways but he's showing here in this
[18:48] scripture that anything that we put
[18:51] above Christ amen will knock us right
[18:53] out of the picture Al together that we
[18:56] can have no love be before his love that
[18:58] we can have no desire above the desire
[19:00] for Christ that if we if we if we love
[19:04] father and mother more than him we're
[19:07] not worthy of him and so then the
[19:10] question now this is the question I have
[19:13] if I love my father and mother less than
[19:15] him am I now worthy of
[19:19] him good question isn't it I think we'll
[19:21] get into that and we'll start answering
[19:23] that amen so so I I don't I don't know
[19:26] why I do this I like to ask questions
[19:28] that Boggle all of us but but as we get
[19:31] through the scripture I think we're
[19:32] going to see a picture emerge or at
[19:33] least I did and I want to I want to
[19:35] share that with you this word Worthy is
[19:39] interesting the word here that says
[19:42] worthy uh it
[19:44] means weighing or having weight having
[19:47] the weight of another a thing like value
[19:51] worth as much so it's something of equal
[19:54] value and and the reason it says having
[19:57] weight or equal weight is because if you
[20:00] refer back to the days of the balance
[20:02] when they would put so much product on
[20:04] one side of the balance and so much
[20:05] weight on the other to figure out what
[20:07] the value would be they would put weight
[20:09] on it or they would put coins or
[20:11] whatever on one side until the value
[20:13] came equal when the came equal in the
[20:15] balance is you know this was as worth as
[20:17] much as this right so that's what the
[20:21] this word is referring to if can we
[20:23] bring up the Whiteboard I'm going to
[20:25] draw a little
[20:27] picture and from for your
[20:29] [Music]
[20:31] amusement so I want to draw this out so
[20:34] we can get a mental picture and then I
[20:35] want to start working with
[20:38] it so if we if we look at a
[20:46] balance I actually practiced
[20:55] this and there'll probably be an
[20:57] engineer or two amongst us says that
[20:58] that's not equal it won't
[21:01] work so if we look at our balance
[21:08] here this is what I'm speaking
[21:13] of Lord okay so when when you put your
[21:18] product your wheat your whatever in one
[21:21] side and then you begin to put the the
[21:23] money or the weight or whatever
[21:24] represents it on the other side you keep
[21:26] adding and adding and adding until it
[21:28] bounces out when it balances out this is
[21:31] as worth as much as this all right so
[21:34] that's what that word means having a
[21:36] like weight or a like value uh a
[21:39] corresponding to a thing they're equal
[21:41] to one another and so now he says if you
[21:44] don't if if you love father and mother
[21:46] more than me you're you're not worthy of
[21:49] me you're not equal to me you're not uh
[21:52] corresponding to me in some way you're
[21:54] not coming to my level yeah and this is
[21:57] interesting so now all of a sudden if I
[21:59] just hate mom and dad now I'm at God's
[22:02] level no that that's not what he's
[22:03] saying so don't don't go down that path
[22:06] please but brother brandham preached
[22:08] another message and he preached a
[22:10] message called is your life worthy of
[22:12] the gospel and he preached it June 30th
[22:15] 1963 and I and I was recently studying
[22:18] that message and here's something that
[22:20] brother bandam says in the opening
[22:22] prayer said Lord Jesus any man
[22:24] physically or woman or child can move
[22:27] back the pages of this Bible Bible but
[22:29] there's no one that can reveal it but
[22:31] you I pray Lord of taking this text as
[22:34] it's placed upon my heart to send out
[22:36] Across the Nation for the people that
[22:38] they might know what type of life is
[22:40] required for them to live what's the
[22:42] subject is your life worthy of the
[22:45] gospel and this worthy of the Gospel has
[22:49] to do with this equal is it of same
[22:51] value as the gospel is it worthy of the
[22:54] gospel and so uh
[22:58] for so many has asked me is the
[23:02] Christian Life a life of church service
[23:04] is it helping the poor the needy or is
[23:06] it a constant member is it loyal is it
[23:09] loyal loyalty to the church and such
[23:11] questions father May the correct answer
[23:13] come tonight through these words as we
[23:16] make an Endeavor to bring them to the
[23:19] people so he wants the people to
[23:22] understand what does it mean to live a
[23:23] Christian Life and he's asking is your
[23:25] life worthy of the Gospel is your life
[23:28] equal to the gospel the good news the
[23:30] message amen there's there a
[23:31] correspondence between your life and the
[23:35] gospel and then he goes to his opening
[23:38] scripture in Luke 14 so if you could
[23:40] turn there with me we'll read this
[23:42] together so when he wants to preach on
[23:44] this subject this is the scripture that
[23:46] he goes
[23:48] to Luke
[23:52] 14 and verse 16 Luke 14 and verse 16
[23:59] then said he unto me a certain man made
[24:02] a great supper and bade many and sent
[24:05] his servant at supper time saying to
[24:06] them that were bidden come for all
[24:08] things are now ready and they all with
[24:11] one consent began to make excuse the
[24:14] first said unto him I have bought a
[24:16] piece of ground and I must needs go and
[24:18] see it I pray thee have have me excused
[24:22] and another said I have bought five yolk
[24:23] of oxen and I go to prove them I pray
[24:26] thee have me excused and another said
[24:28] said I have married a wife and therefore
[24:30] I cannot come so that that servant came
[24:33] and showed his Lord these things then
[24:35] the master of the house being angry said
[24:37] to his servant go out quickly unto the
[24:40] streets and Lanes of the city and bring
[24:42] in thither the poor and the maimed and
[24:45] the Halt and the Blind and the servant
[24:47] said Lord it is done as thou Hast
[24:50] commanded and yet there is room and the
[24:53] Lord said unto the servant go out into
[24:55] the highways and hedges and compel them
[24:57] to come in
[24:58] that my house may be filled for I say
[25:01] unto you that none of those men which
[25:03] were bden shall taste of my supper so
[25:06] this is the opening scripture that he
[25:08] opens with when he wants to preach is
[25:10] your life worthy of the gospel and he
[25:12] tells us that this supper amen is the
[25:15] Feast of the Lord and it's the message
[25:16] of the hour it's the word that God has
[25:18] sent in this hour and it's come to many
[25:20] many were bidden to come to this great
[25:22] feast of the Lord that he's provided in
[25:24] the end time but they made so many
[25:26] excuses and brother V say to starts to
[25:28] say say but my church teaches and and I
[25:30] go here and he starts showing all the
[25:32] excuses that people can have and what is
[25:34] he teaching your is your life worthy of
[25:37] the gospel and now I'm going to go on
[25:38] and read he doesn't read this portion
[25:40] but I'm going to read a couple more
[25:41] verses verse 25 and there went a great
[25:44] multitude with him and he turned and he
[25:46] said unto them if any man come unto me
[25:49] and hate not his father and mother and
[25:51] wife and children and Brethren and
[25:54] sisters yay in his own life also he
[25:57] cannot be my disciple amen and whosoever
[26:00] does not bear his cross and come after
[26:02] me cannot be my disciple am so Jesus now
[26:07] tells this story of the of the of the
[26:10] the man making a feast and and bidding
[26:13] those to come and those that were bidden
[26:15] to come they begin to make excuses and
[26:17] and if you look at their excuses they're
[26:19] all so
[26:20] carnal I bought a piece of ground I have
[26:24] Yol of oxen I have married a wife and
[26:27] they had all of these Earthly things
[26:29] that were hindering them from coming to
[26:31] the feast and brother benam saying this
[26:33] is the Feast of the Lord amen this is
[26:35] the the Feast of the wedding this is the
[26:37] king preparing a wedding and he's
[26:39] calling us to the feast amen and there's
[26:41] those that don't value the invitation to
[26:44] the feast more than they value carnal
[26:46] worldly
[26:48] things amen and I tell you this this
[26:51] this Parable is still playing out today
[26:53] because this Feast is still going on
[26:56] right now amen God has has taken the
[26:58] seals off the book He's prepared a seven
[27:00] course meal this is the great wedding
[27:02] Feast amen and he's bidding us to come
[27:05] to the Feast of the Lord and there's so
[27:07] many people that are tied up with work
[27:08] and family and all this other stuff that
[27:11] they're they're not selling out
[27:13] wholesale for this
[27:15] message
[27:17] amen and this is and then Jesus turns
[27:20] after he gives this Parable there went a
[27:23] great multitude with him and he turned
[27:25] and he said unto them if any man come to
[27:28] me and hate not as father and mother and
[27:32] wife and children and Brethren and
[27:36] sisters yay in his own
[27:39] life he cannot be my disciple praise
[27:45] God listen Jesus said it not me like
[27:50] when you read this this is a hard saying
[27:53] when you when some of his disciples walk
[27:55] away say that it's a hard saying this is
[27:56] a hard saying yes because we love our
[28:00] wives we love our children we love our
[28:02] mother we love our fathers we love our
[28:04] sisters we love our brothers but Jesus
[28:06] is saying unless you're willing to
[28:08] forsake all of that for me you're not
[28:10] worthy of me you're not worthy to be my
[28:12] disciple amen and then he goes on says
[28:14] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[28:17] and come after me cannot be my disciple
[28:20] he's he's calling on us to give up our
[28:23] lives to make a complete surrender Amen
[28:25] to give up everything in this world for
[28:30] him Amen in the message is your life
[28:32] worthy of the Gospel I'm going to quote
[28:34] many quotes from that he says now you've
[28:36] either got to say in this that this is
[28:39] God's Will and God's desire or either
[28:42] something else that you can crop up
[28:44] that's better than what this is now you
[28:47] have to take one or the other and you
[28:49] can't serve God in Mamon that's
[28:54] right he says further down but if it's
[28:57] right you owe your life to it what more
[28:59] could you ever find that would be more
[29:02] of a benefit to you than to know that
[29:04] you you can have eternal
[29:09] life it's amazing that they were bidden
[29:13] to the
[29:15] feast and it was a great honor to be
[29:18] invited to this
[29:20] feast and I don't know about you but I
[29:22] feel it's the greatest honor of my life
[29:24] to be invited to this Feast of the
[29:25] message of the hour the word of God
[29:27] Jesus Christ that is now unfolded before
[29:30] his bride I can't think of any greater
[29:32] privilege on this planet amen it's worth
[29:35] forsaking family it's worth forsaking
[29:37] jobs it's worth forsaking all amen but
[29:40] when they were bidden to the feast amen
[29:42] there was some that made excuses and the
[29:44] excuses like I said were the carnality
[29:46] of life amen I've bought a piece of
[29:48] ground I I've got five yolk of oxen I've
[29:51] married a wife and and it
[29:54] angered the man who made the
[29:56] feast it anged angered him and he said
[29:59] they're not worthy of it go find
[30:01] somebody else who wants to come to my
[30:03] feast and and and so I I there's several
[30:06] things that I want to say and want to
[30:07] look at the moment that they made an
[30:11] excuse the moment they made an excuse
[30:14] they declared that they had a love
[30:18] greater than the love for the Lord his
[30:21] son in his
[30:23] Feast that's the
[30:26] truth there's no other way to look at it
[30:29] that's why he was so angry because it
[30:31] was such it was such a privilege to be
[30:33] invited to this Feast of the lord it's
[30:36] such a privilege to come amen but but
[30:38] the thing that they made the excuse
[30:40] about was the thing that they desired
[30:43] more to be than to be part of this
[30:46] Feast they desired the the the land that
[30:50] they bought they desired The Works that
[30:52] they could do they desire the the wife
[30:54] that they could have they desired it
[30:56] more than the privilege to being part of
[30:58] this
[31:01] Feast the sad part is that's still the
[31:04] same truth
[31:07] today there is people that will forsake
[31:10] they will absolutely forsake this
[31:13] invitation to eternal life this
[31:15] invitation to be one with Christ because
[31:17] of family yes sir because of work
[31:20] because of uh because of a wife because
[31:22] of a husband my wife won't believe so
[31:24] I'm holding back my husband won't
[31:26] believe so I'm holding back amen what
[31:28] right how dare we hold back on God how
[31:31] dare we re withhold ourselves from Jesus
[31:34] Christ just because a spouse doesn't
[31:35] want to come along amen that's not what
[31:38] Jesus told
[31:39] us in the scriptures you say that's hard
[31:42] that's hard but that's what our Lord
[31:44] told us
[31:47] amen and he said if you if you take this
[31:51] road you're not worthy of me if you take
[31:54] this road you cannot be my disciple the
[31:56] only way to be my disciple in any way be
[31:58] worthy of me is to forsake everything
[32:01] and take up your cross and follow after
[32:03] me that's the only
[32:05] way
[32:08] amen let's go to Philippians chapter 3
[32:32] Philippians chapter
[32:33] 3 verse
[32:37] 7 but what things were gained to me
[32:39] those I counted loss for Christ yay
[32:42] doubtless I count all things but loss
[32:45] for the Excellency of the knowledge of
[32:47] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[32:49] suffered the loss of all things and do
[32:51] count them but dung that I may win
[32:54] Christ and be found in him not having my
[32:57] own righteousness which is of the law
[32:58] but that which is through the Faith of
[33:00] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[33:02] by faith Paul the Apostle knew what it
[33:06] was like to have to forsake
[33:08] everything to give up friendships to
[33:10] give up position to give up status to
[33:13] give up a reputation to give up honor
[33:14] amongst his Brethren he gave it all up
[33:17] so that he could win Christ amen he
[33:19] forsook all and he took up his cross and
[33:21] he followed the Lord and he was a
[33:25] disciple amen
[33:28] and the message Christ is the mystery of
[33:30] God revealed brother B says but all this
[33:32] mystery is revealed only as he promised
[33:35] to his bride hell is against this truth
[33:38] of the revelation of this mystery but
[33:40] the bride is standing on it that's her
[33:43] stand why do you hunger Church why do
[33:45] you thirst it's the father trying to
[33:47] reveal his sin secret to you but you let
[33:50] so many things get it out of you you let
[33:53] your job you let your wife you let your
[33:55] husband you let your children you let
[33:57] the car of the world you let some Pastor
[33:59] you let somebody else get that out of
[34:01] you when you know that way down in your
[34:03] heart you're thirsting hungry it's God
[34:06] trying to reveal it to you see the
[34:08] Revelation the last day is here what is
[34:11] it he's invited you to the feast and
[34:13] there's a tug inside for the feast what
[34:15] is holding us back amen what carnal
[34:18] Earthly thing is holding us back what
[34:20] Earthly love is greater than a love for
[34:24] God Amen
[34:28] amen so let's turn to Colossians chapter
[34:31] 3
[34:43] together Colossians chapter
[34:46] 3 verse
[34:51] 1 Colossians 3:1 if you then be risen
[34:54] with Christ seek those things which are
[34:56] above where Christ sth on the right hand
[34:59] of God set your affection on things
[35:02] above not on things on the earth for you
[35:04] are dead and your life is hid with
[35:06] Christ in God when Christ who is your
[35:10] life shall appear then shall you also
[35:12] appear with him in glory amen what a
[35:15] tremendous reward eternal life for what
[35:17] for forsaking everything on Earth and
[35:19] turning all my attention on the things
[35:21] of Heaven amen
[35:24] amen is it I mean it's always comes down
[35:29] the the question is always here and and
[35:31] and we have to deal with it because we
[35:32] deal in this this life and we have human
[35:35] affections we have family and we have
[35:37] all kinds of things that tie us to this
[35:39] life but we have to hold all of that
[35:41] secondary to Christ that's right and we
[35:43] have to consciously do that because is
[35:45] it more noble listen is it Noble to
[35:49] compromise on the word because of a love
[35:51] for another human
[35:54] being how is that right how is it right
[35:57] right to to to change the word and
[36:00] manipulate and soften it amen because of
[36:02] a human love for somebody else how is
[36:05] that how does God view
[36:08] that amen we do some of these things to
[36:11] save ourselves and and we we we think
[36:13] we're doing it to save a spouse or to
[36:15] save a child or to save a loved one or
[36:17] to save a friend or a brother or sister
[36:19] amen because we don't want to leave them
[36:20] out and we don't want to but but but the
[36:24] word is the word amen and Christ is
[36:26] Christ and he's worth losing everything
[36:28] for he's worth being alone he's worth
[36:31] being destitute he's worth being
[36:33] rejected over he's worth he's worth
[36:36] [Applause]
[36:38] it and when we when we change the word
[36:43] for the love of a son or a daughter or
[36:45] we change the word for the love of a
[36:46] spouse what we've just declared is I
[36:49] value this relationship more than I
[36:51] value my relationship with Christ and we
[36:54] would never say that because somehow we
[36:56] want to make this Godly like somehow
[36:59] it's Godly to change the word for a son
[37:02] or daughter to help them along it's
[37:03] Godly somehow to change God's
[37:05] requirement for a spouse to help them
[37:07] along but how is it ever Godly to move
[37:10] away from the word when the word is
[37:14] God
[37:16] Amen these are these are hard things but
[37:19] it's the reality this is the word God is
[37:21] looking for a bride that he can have
[37:23] preeminence in not somebody that's on a
[37:25] some sort of halfway 70% % partnership
[37:28] with him that's not what he's looking
[37:30] for in this day he's not looking for
[37:31] another repeat of the church ages he's
[37:33] looking for a bride that's completely
[37:35] sold out to
[37:36] him and will forsake everything for
[37:40] him so now let's come to this issue of
[37:43] worthy because this is a still a
[37:47] question all right let's draw another
[37:50] balance here see I already got it off my
[37:55] dimensions and proportions aren't right
[37:57] but I learned how to use the
[38:02] Eraser so let's go up here and do this
[38:07] again and now let's draw this
[38:10] scale this
[38:12] balance like
[38:19] this now we'll go up
[38:26] here and and we'll go down
[38:32] here okay down
[38:35] here we have
[38:37] Christ and here we have
[38:41] me he's so much more valuable than
[38:45] me how am I going to bring this to a
[38:49] balance he said you're not worthy of
[38:51] you're not corresponding to me is your
[38:54] life worthy or in a correspondence of
[38:56] the Gospel of the the same worth how am
[38:59] I how am I going to balance this
[39:01] scale well you just have to hate your
[39:04] mother and your
[39:06] father there's a lot of people who hate
[39:08] mother and father but they're not
[39:09] balancing the
[39:11] scale so so what's it going to take to
[39:14] balance the scale because because I
[39:17] can't do it I can go up here and and and
[39:21] I can listen I can add joining Church
[39:29] I can add Good
[39:33] Deeds I can put in here
[39:37] fasting
[39:41] praying and I how am I what am I going
[39:45] to put on this side of the balance to
[39:47] bring it balance what can I do what what
[39:51] what works can I do what Deeds can I do
[39:54] what effort can I put forth what in the
[39:56] world can I do to balance this because I
[39:58] want to be worthy of I know that if I
[40:00] put anything before him I'm not worthy
[40:02] of him and and brother benham's asking
[40:05] the question now and is your life worthy
[40:07] of the Gospel he said is your life in
[40:09] correspondence or equal to or worthy the
[40:11] gospel that's been preached in this age
[40:13] and you think no there's nothing in me
[40:15] that's worth this message there's
[40:16] nothing in me that's equal to it in my
[40:19] flesh that is there's nothing that I can
[40:21] do to bring myself equal to this message
[40:23] is So Glorious it is Christ himself
[40:27] so what do I do so we're going to keep
[40:29] going a little further we'll get back to
[40:31] that
[40:32] question cuz it's a good question and
[40:35] the in the message he says we've got to
[40:37] follow every day every hour of the day
[40:39] every step of the way we've got to be
[40:41] led by the Lord Jesus Christ if we don't
[40:44] we take an organizational life and a
[40:47] life that doesn't follow Christ daily is
[40:49] not worthy so he's told us all kinds of
[40:52] things that makes us not worthy if we
[40:54] love father and mother more than him
[40:55] we're not worthy if we love wife more
[40:57] than him if we love children more than
[40:59] him we're not worthy if we love our own
[41:01] life more than him we're not worthy if
[41:03] we don't take up our cross and follow
[41:04] him we're not worthy if we don't follow
[41:06] him daily we're not worthy we got a
[41:09] whole pile of not being
[41:12] worthy amen and how many feels the pile
[41:16] piled on you of not worthy amen not
[41:19] worthy not worthy not worthy but a life
[41:22] that doesn't follow Christ daily is not
[41:23] worthy and brother asking the question
[41:25] is your life worthy of the gospel now
[41:29] let's go to
[41:30] [Music]
[41:32] uh yeah let's go to 2 Corinthians
[41:34] chapter
[41:53] 5 all right 1 Corinthians or second
[41:56] Corinthians I'm sorry 2 Corinthians
[42:01] 5:14 For the Love of Christ constrain us
[42:04] because we thus judge that if one died
[42:07] for all then were all dead so if he died
[42:10] for all of us we were all dead do you
[42:12] believe that we were dead
[42:15] spiritually and that he died for all
[42:17] that they which live should not
[42:20] henceforth live unto themselves but un
[42:22] him which died for them and rose again
[42:26] so this is the key amen he died for all
[42:30] why so that they so that uh I'm sorry so
[42:34] that they which live how should we live
[42:37] we live in Christ so that they which
[42:39] live should not henceforth live unto
[42:41] themselves but unto him which died for
[42:43] them and rose again so now I'm dead and
[42:46] my life is hid in Christ I've crucified
[42:49] the flesh with the lust thereof now what
[42:51] has to happen is I have to die so that I
[42:53] can take my cross that I don't love my
[42:55] life more than him and I don't love any
[42:57] part of my life more than
[42:59] him this is so
[43:01] critical because some of these things
[43:03] are so subtle these little hooks that
[43:06] get in us that hold us back from an
[43:08] overcoming life are so subtle they're
[43:10] they're they're they're Family Ties and
[43:12] human affection and and and things that
[43:14] we tied to in the world and and lust of
[43:17] the Flesh and these things that have us
[43:19] tied and bound down amen and and that we
[43:21] don't sometimes realize what they're
[43:23] hindering in our spiritual walk and in
[43:25] our spiritual life and we must realize
[43:27] that there's got to be nothing that even
[43:29] compares or comes close to my love for
[43:32] Christ that if I have to stand alone I
[43:34] have to stand alone if no one will stand
[43:36] with me if that's the price I have to
[43:38] pay then by the grace of God God help me
[43:40] to stand with you before I stand with
[43:43] anything
[43:44] else help me
[43:46] God and so now this is a this is a quote
[43:50] that I want to start laboring on because
[43:51] we've got this balance that's all the
[43:52] way off and I don't know how I'm going
[43:54] to ever become worthy amen I know all
[43:57] the kind of things that make me not
[43:59] worthy there's a whole pile of that make
[44:01] me not worthy amen but what is going to
[44:04] make me worthy what's going to make my
[44:06] life worthy of the Gospel what's going
[44:08] to make me worthy of
[44:09] Christ and he says again in the same
[44:12] message a Christian is not a tool or
[44:14] some kind of mechanical wrench to a
[44:16] great big religious regime that's right
[44:18] a Christian is not some kind of a tool
[44:20] that keeps a religious organization
[44:21] moving a Christian that is not a
[44:24] Christian a Christian is to be
[44:25] Christlike amen and a Christian cannot
[44:28] be a Christian until Christ comes into
[44:31] the man the Life of Christ in him then
[44:34] it produces the life that Christ lived
[44:36] and you do the things that Christ
[44:39] did what am I talking about personal
[44:42] relationship to Christ what is it is
[44:44] your life worthy of the Gospel amen when
[44:47] brother B starts laying this out in your
[44:49] life worthy of the Gospel he starts
[44:51] talking about the way we Act and the way
[44:52] we dress and the compromise on the word
[44:54] and taking our our parents' religion and
[44:57] staying in the denominational system and
[44:59] being attached to the things of the
[45:01] world and not for he goes to all of that
[45:03] to show how many ways we're not worthy
[45:05] of the Gospel but I want to know how am
[45:08] I going to be worthy of the Gospel how
[45:10] am I going to have a life worthy of the
[45:11] Gospel I know all the things I do wrong
[45:13] and I know all the things that will keep
[45:15] me from it but there's got to be
[45:17] something that will measure up and level
[45:19] up my
[45:20] life and there's only one thing I know
[45:23] of because that the these Deeds aren't
[45:25] going to do it of them I can pile them
[45:28] on all day long I can go to church I can
[45:30] pay great M sums of money I can do all
[45:33] kinds of things it's not going to level
[45:34] it up but the only way it's going to
[45:36] level it up if I can get what's over
[45:38] here over here and when that comes in
[45:42] place now all of a sudden we've got
[45:45] Christ over here and we have Christ over
[45:49] here and that'll bring a balance in my
[45:52] life and make my life worthy of the
[45:55] Gospel amen amen hallelujah it's not
[45:59] something I can just put on and do but
[46:02] it's something I surrender to but what's
[46:04] hindering Christ in my life all of these
[46:07] other things that are making me not
[46:08] worthy not taking up my Christ loving my
[46:11] life wanting to try out my yoke of oxen
[46:13] wanting to stay with my field wanting to
[46:16] stay with my
[46:17] family that's all hindering the move of
[46:20] Christ in my life and keeping me off
[46:24] balance praise God but what's it going
[46:26] to to take an absolute complete
[46:29] surrender to the will of God and a
[46:31] laying down of my life completely and
[46:33] taking up my cross and following him so
[46:35] that the life that's on one side of this
[46:38] equation can move to the other side of
[46:40] the equation and bring a balance and now
[46:43] my life can be worthy of the Gospel why
[46:46] because of Good Deeds because of good
[46:48] character because no because Christ in
[46:50] me the hope of
[46:53] glory so if I have to measure up to
[46:56] Christ the
[46:59] word how am I going to measure up the if
[47:01] I don't measure up the Christ the word
[47:03] I'm not measuring the Christ I'm not
[47:04] worthy of Christ amen but to measure up
[47:07] to Christ the word it's going to take
[47:09] Christ the spirit that's right because
[47:12] it's the spirit of the word it's the
[47:14] spirit that comes in and gives me the
[47:16] power to live the word to make me worthy
[47:19] of the Gospel thank
[47:21] you
[47:24] amen Jesus told his disciples
[47:27] when he was departing he said in Luke
[47:29] 24:49 I'll just read it to you and
[47:32] behold I send the promise of my father
[47:34] upon you but T ye in the city of
[47:37] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[47:39] from on high amen he there was an
[47:42] equation there was something that was
[47:44] going to level this up Amen to make them
[47:47] their make their lives worthy of the
[47:49] Gospel amen because they had all just
[47:52] abandoned him and left him in his hour
[47:53] of
[47:54] need Peter says I'll never forsake you
[47:57] they all forsake you I'm ready to go to
[47:59] prison and even give my life amen and
[48:02] and and then the Bible says and so said
[48:04] all the
[48:05] disciples and a few hours from them
[48:07] they're all running for their life and
[48:09] they've abandoned him Peter's denying
[48:10] him he's cursing and we have all this
[48:13] disaster going on why because their
[48:15] their life cannot measure to the word
[48:21] right but he
[48:23] says T ye in the city of Jerusalem
[48:27] amen don't go out in the ministry don't
[48:29] go try to be a Christian don't go out
[48:31] and try to prove it don't go don't do
[48:33] anything until you're indued with power
[48:35] from on high if you're going to go out
[48:37] and carry the word you need the power of
[48:39] the word to manifest the word so that
[48:41] your life can be worthy of the
[48:43] Gospel amen amen if we don't catch this
[48:47] principle then all of a sudden the only
[48:49] thing we can do is go into legalistic
[48:51] thinking legalistic thinking leaves us
[48:53] completely absolutely void and we have
[48:57] no energy to even
[48:58] live we throw in the towel amen by 9:00
[49:02] in the morning we've made so many
[49:03] mistakes we throw the tow and we give up
[49:05] I'm never going to get it amen but it's
[49:07] not that amen it's it's it's life worthy
[49:10] of the Gospel amen is a life that
[49:12] surrendered to Christ and by the power
[49:14] of the Holy Ghost is following Christ
[49:16] the word in every
[49:18] way amen is it a perfect life we're not
[49:21] talking about a perfect life we're
[49:22] talking about a surrendered
[49:24] life amen amen to be worthy of the
[49:28] Gospel doesn't mean I live a perfect
[49:30] life amen it doesn't mean I never have a
[49:31] fault I never have a mistake Peter
[49:33] certainly did even after the baptism of
[49:35] the Holy Ghost amen it's not that it's
[49:37] not Perfection that we're looking for
[49:39] it's having the perfect one inside
[49:42] leading in guiding and staying
[49:43] surrendered to that
[49:45] leadership the when when he says whoa
[49:48] that was wrong you go back and repent
[49:50] and you make it right amen you may go
[49:52] wrong but you've got you've got the
[49:54] equalizer on the inside to make make
[49:56] your life worthy of the
[50:00] Gospel
[50:03] Amen brother bam says I'm stilling the
[50:05] message is your life worthy of the
[50:07] Gospel when this takes place the thing
[50:09] you'll do then you'll find out that the
[50:11] spirit that comes in you from the New
[50:14] Birth you will believe and do everything
[50:16] that God says in his word is for you to
[50:18] do amen and everything that the Bible
[50:21] quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it
[50:23] with amen and you'll not stop day or
[50:25] night until you receive it that's right
[50:28] that's right and in all this time you'll
[50:30] certainly above everything bear the
[50:31] fruit of the
[50:33] spirit amen the spirit that comes into
[50:36] you from the New Birth it will believe
[50:38] and do everything God says in his word
[50:41] for you to doise God Amen that's what we
[50:45] need to have a life worthy of the
[50:49] Gospel without the spirit of God we're
[50:52] never moving the scale the balance can't
[50:55] budge
[50:57] I can't get it right I can't overcome my
[50:59] own flesh I I I I I can't have the
[51:03] boldness to stand on the word I keep
[51:06] what do I need I need the
[51:08] indwelling of
[51:10] Christ I need the one that gives me the
[51:12] power to say Amen to the word I need the
[51:15] one that gives me the power to deny my
[51:17] flesh and take the word I need the one
[51:18] that gives me the power in the face of
[51:21] opposition from the ones I love the most
[51:23] and something in me still gives me the
[51:25] power to say I'm sorry sorry I know that
[51:27] you're hurt and I know that you don't
[51:28] believe this and I know that you don't
[51:30] trust me and I know that you're upset
[51:32] with me but I have to go the way of the
[51:34] word I love you but I have no choice but
[51:37] to follow after Christ and take my cross
[51:39] and follow him daily I have no option I
[51:42] have to amen because there's a life
[51:44] inside of me pushing me to the
[51:48] word this isn't willpower if it was
[51:50] willpower we would have all crashed and
[51:53] and some of us have crashed but it was
[51:55] the spirit of God who picked us back
[52:00] up
[52:01] amen praise be to
[52:04] God aren't you so glad that when God had
[52:06] a requirement he had a way to meet the
[52:09] requirement when brother bam said is
[52:11] your life worthy of the Gospel I'm so
[52:13] glad he didn't start with the title
[52:15] because as soon as he said the title I
[52:17] say
[52:18] no cuz I'm looking at Flash and I'm
[52:20] looking at myself in the mirror and I'm
[52:22] looking at all my abilities and I'm not
[52:24] worthy of this gospel I'm not not worthy
[52:27] to be bid to the marriage supper I'm not
[52:29] worthy of the invitation I've got I'm
[52:31] not worthy to have a seat at the table
[52:32] I'm not worthy of any of that but he
[52:34] made me worthy amen he brought an
[52:37] equalization to me I was in the dumps I
[52:40] was distraught I was cast to the side in
[52:42] the junk heap of the of the rubble of
[52:45] life amen but he came and he paid a
[52:47] price and shed his blood for me to bring
[52:49] the balance back up so that he could put
[52:51] his life into me and make me worthy of
[52:54] the Gospel
[52:56] not because my efforts made me worthy
[52:59] yes sir because he made me
[53:06] worthy you know brother B's talking
[53:09] about in all of this he's talking about
[53:11] staying with your denomination he's
[53:13] talking about staying with the love of
[53:15] the world he's talking about uh having
[53:17] short hair and wearing makeup and and
[53:19] you think your life's worthy of the
[53:21] Gospel what he's not saying that if you
[53:25] stop wearing makeup you'll become
[53:28] worthy it's not what he's saying what
[53:31] he's saying is as long as you're
[53:33] rejecting the word there's no way you'll
[53:35] ever be worthy right because you need
[53:37] the person of the word to come in you
[53:39] need to be born again by the baptism of
[53:42] the Holy Ghost you need the indwelling
[53:44] of the power you need to be endued with
[53:46] power from on high so that you can say
[53:49] no to the flesh you can say no to the
[53:51] Temptation you can't do it on your
[53:54] own right it takes the spirit of God to
[53:58] bring the
[54:01] balance
[54:03] amen I so thank
[54:05] God the Apostle Paul was going the wrong
[54:09] way and all of his wisdom and all of his
[54:12] efforts and all of it and everything he
[54:14] had Zeal he had Zeal for God he had a
[54:16] desire to do things right but he was
[54:18] doing everything
[54:20] wrong until God come injected himself in
[54:23] his path amen and he filled him with the
[54:25] spirit amen and then what happened amen
[54:27] he made Paul worthy of the Gospel he
[54:30] made his life worthy of the Gospel why
[54:33] because he turned from a persecutor of
[54:35] the of the truth the one who was stand
[54:36] for the truth one who was rejecting it
[54:38] the one who believed it and taught it
[54:40] and gave his life for it how did that
[54:43] happen that wasn't the man that was God
[54:45] in the
[54:46] man
[54:49] amen Peter the disciples none of them
[54:52] could be worthy of the
[54:54] Gospel they needed Christ
[54:57] they needed Christ to tip the
[55:00] scale in their
[55:03] favor God's required for me to follow
[55:07] him above everything else and he's and
[55:09] he's required me to keep his word and
[55:12] obey his
[55:13] word then he's going to have to supply
[55:16] something to
[55:18] me because if that's his requirement I
[55:20] and myself can't meet that
[55:23] requirement so he's going to have to
[55:25] supply something to me to give me the
[55:28] power to meet the
[55:31] requirements
[55:34] amen I don't believe Jesus Christ wants
[55:36] a bride who's a compromiser no sir no do
[55:40] you no do you think Christ wants a bride
[55:44] who will take human relationships over
[55:46] their relationship to
[55:48] him I don't believe that sir well if if
[55:51] he wants a pure bride if he wants one
[55:53] that's sold out for him if he wants one
[55:55] that that'll leave all the Earthly
[55:57] things for him and be totally dedicated
[55:59] to him then he needs somebody that he
[56:01] can fill with his Spirit to give them
[56:02] the power to be the bride that he's
[56:04] called to be in this hour
[56:06] amen and so what has he done he supplied
[56:09] the spirit amen he he you know the Holy
[56:13] Ghost has been bound by these
[56:15] denominational Rivers for nearly 2,000
[56:17] years why because they were held the the
[56:20] the fullness of the Holy Ghost was held
[56:22] back by wrong teaching and wrong
[56:23] understanding but in the end time amen
[56:26] and the end time message the Holy Ghost
[56:28] has come back and the fullness of the
[56:29] word has brought the fullness of the
[56:31] spirit which brings the fullness of the
[56:33] power to live the full word of God it is
[56:36] available today so that he can have a
[56:38] bride amen that won't be a compromising
[56:43] bride Why by his power by his Spirit
[56:47] that's why he's done what he's done in
[56:49] this day that's why he took the seals
[56:51] off the book that's why he he he moved
[56:53] the obscurity away and gave his eyes to
[56:55] see and ears to hear so that we can be
[56:57] what he's called us to be in this
[57:01] hour amen I was reading through this uh
[57:04] is your life worthy of the gospel and I
[57:06] came across this story brother Benham
[57:10] tells and he's talking about we've
[57:13] talked about it many times but he's
[57:14] talking about standing by the side of
[57:16] the bed when his little baby's
[57:19] dying and he talks about it's the
[57:21] darkest hour he ever had he prayed to
[57:23] God and like a black sheet come down God
[57:25] wouldn't hear his answer and then the
[57:27] devil starts speaking to him and this is
[57:29] where I'm going to pick it up he says
[57:30] then I begin to listen to him that's
[57:33] reasoning I thought that's right the
[57:35] devil was telling him God could easily
[57:38] change this
[57:39] situation but he's not and brother
[57:42] saying that's
[57:43] reasoning that was right God could
[57:45] change it but he wasn't he said and what
[57:49] have you done a young man and all your
[57:51] friends consider you a crank and you've
[57:53] been rejected and and
[57:57] you stay out preaching all night you
[57:58] sleep a few hours you get up and go to
[58:00] work the next day and this is how he
[58:02] repays you and brother vom somewhere
[58:05] else says and all that he was saying was
[58:08] true but I want you to catch what he
[58:12] said he said said he can tell he don't
[58:15] have to speak the word just look to your
[58:17] baby and it would live I said that's
[58:20] right and as much as you've done for him
[58:23] and yet that's what he does for you I
[58:25] said said that's
[58:27] right I begin to think well what see
[58:30] everything begin to break away when it
[58:32] come to
[58:33] reasonings the devil was reasoning in
[58:35] his mind and he was beginning to
[58:38] break but when it come to that that hung
[58:42] it stayed there I was just about ready
[58:44] to say then I'll
[58:46] quit but when I got down to all the
[58:50] reasoning Powers had broke away then it
[58:52] come to that eternal life that new birth
[58:56] what if it hadn't have been
[58:58] there what if it hadn't have been there
[59:01] and he says what if it what if it hadn't
[59:04] have we would have know we wouldn't have
[59:07] known one another the way we do now this
[59:09] church would not have been here like
[59:11] this and the thousands of millions
[59:12] around the world but thank God it was
[59:15] there then I thought what who am I
[59:18] anyhow who am I to question his majesty
[59:20] who am I to question the Creator that
[59:23] give me my very life here on Earth where
[59:25] did I get that baby who give it to me
[59:28] not mine anyhow he just loaned her to me
[59:30] for a while I said Satan get away from
[59:33] me I went over laid my hand on the baby
[59:35] I said God bless you sweetheart in a
[59:37] minute daddy will take you down put you
[59:39] on mommy's arms the angels will pack
[59:41] your little soul away and I'll meet you
[59:43] in that morning and I said Lord you give
[59:46] her to me you're taking her away though
[59:49] you slay me like job said yet I love you
[59:52] and believe you if you send me to hell
[59:55] I'll love you anyhow now I can't get
[59:57] away from that there you are just an
[59:59] intellectual it all broke away but you
[1:00:02] got to have personal relationship you've
[1:00:04] got to be born
[1:00:07] again what's he preaching is your life
[1:00:09] worthy of the Gospel he comes to his
[1:00:10] hardest test and if it was not for the
[1:00:13] Holy Ghost in his soul he would have
[1:00:15] failed the test he would have forsaken
[1:00:18] God he would have took the reasoning he
[1:00:20] would have went the intellectual Road
[1:00:22] and he would have quit the ministry and
[1:00:24] quit on God is that what the prophet
[1:00:26] told us but what happened what happened
[1:00:30] to him you know what was happening he
[1:00:32] was loving his wife and he was loving
[1:00:34] his daughter so much that he wasn't
[1:00:36] feeling the love of God Amen and the
[1:00:39] reasoning started to work because of his
[1:00:41] love for a wife and because of his love
[1:00:43] for a daughter and the reason he began
[1:00:45] to work and say God don't love
[1:00:48] you said when he got so far that was far
[1:00:52] enough and he knew that was wrong what
[1:00:55] was it that held it was that New Birth
[1:00:57] that held What What In His hour of
[1:01:00] Temptation kept him amen from giving in
[1:01:04] to the love for a child and the love for
[1:01:06] a
[1:01:09] spouse it wasn't that he didn't love his
[1:01:11] little
[1:01:12] girl it wasn't that he didn't love his
[1:01:15] wife but what happened is he realized he
[1:01:18] loved God
[1:01:20] more you've given her you take her away
[1:01:25] blessed be the the name of the Lord you
[1:01:27] know what that means I love you the
[1:01:33] most what held just I I can't express it
[1:01:37] enough what held this man in this hour
[1:01:40] was not his
[1:01:41] willpower was not his mind was not the
[1:01:45] only thing that held him was Christ on
[1:01:47] the inside the only thing that made him
[1:01:50] in his hour of Temptation worthy of the
[1:01:53] Gospel what was the worthy of the Gospel
[1:01:55] worthy of the gospel meant he was able
[1:01:57] to surrender to the will and to the word
[1:01:59] of God what made him able to surrender
[1:02:02] to God's Will and subject himself to God
[1:02:05] that way the only thing that made it
[1:02:06] possible was Christ Living on the
[1:02:09] inside cuz he was a seed of God he was
[1:02:11] part of the word he could not leave the
[1:02:15] word listen I'm glad I've never faced
[1:02:18] this
[1:02:19] test and I hope to God I never do I hope
[1:02:24] you never do but I've had some hard
[1:02:28] tests I've had some tests that took me
[1:02:31] to the point of
[1:02:32] breaking I've had some tests where
[1:02:35] family said they wouldn't go the way I'm
[1:02:41] going I don't even know how I made
[1:02:45] it I can't tell you I mean I know how
[1:02:48] but in myself I have no idea how I made
[1:02:52] it we went through such a struggle when
[1:02:55] we first came to this message I believed
[1:02:58] before my wife believed and we had just
[1:03:01] had a baby and and and Blake was only 6
[1:03:04] weeks old and I had been hearing about
[1:03:07] the message and believing it and feeding
[1:03:08] on it was stirring in my heart and
[1:03:10] brother Jeremy invited me to come up to
[1:03:12] church in the old sanctuary and and
[1:03:14] Angie's parents were pulling on her to
[1:03:16] leave me to come back home because they
[1:03:18] thought this was a cult and they thought
[1:03:20] it was men dominating women and there
[1:03:22] was all kinds of evil things being
[1:03:23] whispered in her ear she had just
[1:03:25] delivered baby she had only been married
[1:03:26] a year her parents were telling her this
[1:03:28] is a cult her husband and her mind is
[1:03:30] losing his mind amen and she's losing
[1:03:32] her mind and I'm losing my
[1:03:34] mind one of the hardest Trials of my
[1:03:37] life amen but I I knew I had to come see
[1:03:41] if this is the truth something was
[1:03:42] stirring in my heart and I believed the
[1:03:44] word and I was believing the message and
[1:03:46] I had to come see and something was
[1:03:48] pulling me amen and we come to the
[1:03:51] moment we come to the hour amen Jeremy
[1:03:53] pulled up outside and I was going out
[1:03:55] the door and when I was going out the
[1:03:57] door my wife looked at me and said I
[1:03:59] cannot believe that you're leaving
[1:04:01] us I can't believe you're leaving me to
[1:04:05] go to those people yes she's holding a
[1:04:08] six- week old baby sitting on the couch
[1:04:12] crying praise God praise God I looked at
[1:04:16] her and I
[1:04:18] said I love
[1:04:19] you but I have to go I have to go see if
[1:04:24] this is the truth
[1:04:27] amen she looked at me and she said I may
[1:04:31] not be here when you get back
[1:04:35] am and I knew her parents were trying to
[1:04:37] pull her back
[1:04:38] home may not be here when you get
[1:04:42] back that was a long drive to Lia from
[1:04:45] Lebanon
[1:04:47] Ohio but I come to the service the
[1:04:50] service was amazing I heard the word
[1:04:53] preached I heard it preached in its
[1:04:54] Purity my heart was soaring because I
[1:04:57] finally was connecting with the reality
[1:04:59] that was inside of
[1:05:02] me then I had to get back in that
[1:05:07] car sister Carol's
[1:05:10] Jeep I had to get back in that car and
[1:05:13] take that 2-hour trip home the closer I
[1:05:17] got to home the quieter I got because I
[1:05:20] didn't know if she would be there or not
[1:05:26] listen I don't know how I made it yes I
[1:05:30] don't know how I walked out the door I
[1:05:32] have no idea how I closed it behind me
[1:05:35] me myself imagining back to the day I
[1:05:38] have no idea how I did
[1:05:40] that but it wasn't me there was another
[1:05:43] Power pulling me he was pulling a Son of
[1:05:46] God back to the word back to where I
[1:05:48] came from there was a magnetism that was
[1:05:50] beyond Humanity amen it was God what was
[1:05:53] he doing he was tipping the scale for me
[1:05:56] because I didn't have the power in
[1:05:58] myself thank
[1:06:01] amen amen how are we going to make it
[1:06:04] how are we going to face it when we come
[1:06:05] to our hours of decision and our times
[1:06:07] of loss and our times of separation and
[1:06:10] Hey listen there's separation all the
[1:06:12] time people are always coming and people
[1:06:15] are always going people are always
[1:06:17] believing the message and people are
[1:06:19] always stop believing the message and
[1:06:21] those you're friends with now they may
[1:06:22] not believe 5 10 years from now amen
[1:06:24] what's going to hold you in that hour
[1:06:26] what is going to hold you is it going to
[1:06:28] be your willpower your good teaching
[1:06:30] because you read the message no it's got
[1:06:32] to be something on the inside there's
[1:06:34] got to be a power you have to be endued
[1:06:36] with power from on high or we'll never
[1:06:38] make it friends there's our human side
[1:06:41] is too weak amen our natural affections
[1:06:44] are so strong sometimes but there's got
[1:06:46] to be a greater love above all other
[1:06:50] lovees have no idea I have no idea how I
[1:06:55] got from a 21-year-old boy ignorant and
[1:06:57] doesn't know anything and went through
[1:06:59] that I have no idea I got from there to
[1:07:01] here but I'll tell you one thing it
[1:07:02] wasn't my strength my power my ability
[1:07:05] amen it was nothing more than the life
[1:07:07] of Jesus Christ coming into me cuz I
[1:07:09] could not have done it on my
[1:07:14] own and you couldn't be sitting in the
[1:07:16] seat you're sitting in if it wasn't for
[1:07:18] the power of God and if we stay
[1:07:20] connected to this word and we stay
[1:07:22] following him it's because we forsaken
[1:07:24] all other and take taken him and his
[1:07:26] life has come in to tip the
[1:07:28] scale there's no other way
[1:07:31] friends human affection will eventually
[1:07:33] wear
[1:07:35] out the reasoning will eventually win
[1:07:38] the
[1:07:39] day we've watched it happen over and
[1:07:42] over and over
[1:07:46] again it's going to take a greater
[1:07:49] power you know what I think we should
[1:07:52] do I think we should wait in Jerusalem
[1:07:55] till were endued with power from on high
[1:07:58] I think we should seek the baptism of
[1:08:00] Holy Ghost and The Life of Christ to
[1:08:01] give us the power to live this word or
[1:08:04] we're not going to make
[1:08:11] it Jesus
[1:08:14] said in the Garden of Gethsemane father
[1:08:16] if it if thou be willing remove this cup
[1:08:19] for
[1:08:20] me nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:08:24] done yes sir
[1:08:26] you know that's almost the same thing
[1:08:27] that brother brandham said standing at
[1:08:29] the bedside of his daughter that's right
[1:08:32] who was that Christ that was Christ and
[1:08:35] our brother that was that seed that
[1:08:38] taken over in the hour of crisis when it
[1:08:41] was beyond man when it was beyond human
[1:08:44] that seed took over that's right he said
[1:08:47] the lord giveth the lord taketh away
[1:08:49] blessed be the name of the
[1:08:54] Lord back in the message is your life
[1:08:56] worthy he says he was full of Faith why
[1:09:00] he knowed his words couldn't fail he so
[1:09:03] lived by the word till he became the
[1:09:06] word oh God let me hold both my hands to
[1:09:10] God before this audience let me live
[1:09:12] like that let his word so become that me
[1:09:16] and his word is the same thing Let My
[1:09:19] Words Be his words let the meditation of
[1:09:21] my heart let him be my let let him be in
[1:09:25] my my heart on my mind tie his
[1:09:27] Commandments about the post of my
[1:09:28] intelligence tie them about the post of
[1:09:30] my heart let me just see him when
[1:09:33] Temptation Rises let me see Christ when
[1:09:35] things go wrong let me just see him when
[1:09:37] I get uh when I get ready and the enemy
[1:09:40] try to make me get angry let me see
[1:09:42] Jesus what would he do he was so much in
[1:09:45] the word till him and the word became
[1:09:47] the self-same
[1:09:49] thing why why because the spirit of the
[1:09:53] word comes into us to help us live the
[1:09:57] word we can't do it any other
[1:10:02] way amen he goes on in the message what
[1:10:05] shall I do with this Jesus called Christ
[1:10:07] God's body United as as his bride being
[1:10:10] one him and Christ together is the
[1:10:12] spirit working in the flesh of the
[1:10:14] church like it worked in the flesh of
[1:10:16] Jesus Christ because it's part of his
[1:10:18] body not Tain but one they are one a
[1:10:21] husband and wife is no longer two but
[1:10:23] one and Christ is his body body is one
[1:10:26] and the Same Spirit was in Christ is in
[1:10:28] his bride in his body that unites them
[1:10:30] together with all the word and God
[1:10:32] living in there himself manifesting it
[1:10:35] prise God what is that that is him
[1:10:38] making me worthy of the
[1:10:40] Gospel amen that is him making my life
[1:10:44] match his word glory to God because
[1:10:46] brother benam when he says your life
[1:10:47] worthy of the Gospel he starts showing
[1:10:49] how far off the word many lives are and
[1:10:51] he's saying is your life worthy of the
[1:10:53] gospel and he's not saying hey just just
[1:10:56] start doing right he's he's wanting
[1:10:58] people to recognize I don't have what it
[1:11:01] takes I'm falling short I'm way shorter
[1:11:04] than I need to be what do I need to do
[1:11:06] we need a wakeup call sometimes because
[1:11:09] what we need is the reality inside of us
[1:11:11] amen not group consensus not group
[1:11:14] strength we need an individual personal
[1:11:16] relationship with Christ Alone where
[1:11:18] when we're all by ourselves Christ gives
[1:11:21] us the strength in the hour of
[1:11:22] Temptation that's beyond human amen
[1:11:27] brother brandom didn't have his whole
[1:11:29] church there when he was standing by his
[1:11:30] baby's bedside he didn't have the
[1:11:32] support group he didn't have a text line
[1:11:35] he didn't have a prayer chain going on
[1:11:37] what he had was the indwelling of the
[1:11:39] spirit of God a seat of God and the
[1:11:41] power of God to give him power when he
[1:11:44] had no more power to give him strength
[1:11:46] when he had no more strength so that he
[1:11:48] could stay with the word of God and love
[1:11:50] Christ more than he loved anything
[1:11:53] else if you you love mother or father
[1:11:57] more than me you're not worthy of me if
[1:12:00] you love
[1:12:03] yourself more than me you're not worthy
[1:12:06] of me if you love your wife if you love
[1:12:08] your children more than me you're not
[1:12:12] worthy of me
[1:12:14] amen it's better just to say God make me
[1:12:19] worthy make me worthy of you Lord I I
[1:12:22] admit I'm weak in my flesh I I keep
[1:12:25] getting tripped up I don't seem to have
[1:12:27] the power to take the stand I need to
[1:12:29] take against my family I don't have the
[1:12:31] power the boldness to move out in your
[1:12:33] word I keep falling back I don't have
[1:12:36] the power in the hour of Temptation when
[1:12:37] I'm all alone Amen to resist the devil
[1:12:40] God make me worthy please come and make
[1:12:43] me worthy come and do something in me
[1:12:45] that I cannot do myself endue me with
[1:12:48] power from on high amen so that you can
[1:12:51] make me worthy of the Gospel thank you
[1:12:54] Lord
[1:12:58] God I said before I hope I never have to
[1:13:01] face a trial like brother Benham
[1:13:04] faced but we've all faced trials right
[1:13:08] we've all had separations
[1:13:11] and
[1:13:13] am but he who brought me through the
[1:13:16] last one is the same power I'm depending
[1:13:19] on to bring me through the next
[1:13:22] one the one that helped me overcome the
[1:13:25] first time yes when it was
[1:13:27] impossible is the same one that will
[1:13:29] help me overcome next time when it's
[1:13:33] impossible how is it the bride's going
[1:13:35] to stand on that word and take that
[1:13:37] glorious stand I tell you how she's
[1:13:39] going to do it it's going to be Christ
[1:13:41] living through
[1:13:43] her it's not going to be her and her
[1:13:46] human strength it's going to be Christ
[1:13:48] in her manifesting his own word what's
[1:13:52] it going to take it's going to take a
[1:13:53] surrendered life
[1:13:55] what's our portion in this what's our
[1:13:57] part trying harder heaping stuff on our
[1:14:01] side of the basket to try to listen
[1:14:04] we've tried all that I don't know how
[1:14:06] long you've been around but you've tried
[1:14:08] being a good boy and doing nice things
[1:14:09] and paying extra in the tithe and
[1:14:11] sending the missions and move the scale
[1:14:13] and you realize it doesn't
[1:14:17] work what am I supposed to do stop
[1:14:21] trying and surrender
[1:14:25] so God I give it if I lose my job so be
[1:14:29] it amen if I lose my family so be it if
[1:14:34] I lose my house if I lose my reputation
[1:14:37] so be it so be it am I remember I was
[1:14:41] reading the biography of uh uh Charles
[1:14:44] Spurgeon and Charles Spurgeon brother B
[1:14:46] said he was a great preacher back in the
[1:14:48] 1800s and and he was preaching the
[1:14:51] gospel and he had he had predestination
[1:14:53] down pat in his day and and he was
[1:14:55] preaching and they didn't like that that
[1:14:58] he was having such crowds and the and
[1:15:00] the paper started making fun of him
[1:15:01] other religious leaders started making
[1:15:02] fun of him they started slandering his
[1:15:04] name they started making little cartoons
[1:15:06] of him in the in the newspapers and it
[1:15:08] destroyed him he went into deep
[1:15:10] depression amen because he couldn't
[1:15:12] believe the things they were saying
[1:15:13] about him and then he he got alone with
[1:15:17] God and he and it I believe this was an
[1:15:20] excerpt from his
[1:15:21] diary from his journal and he said Lord
[1:15:25] Lord the only thing that I have in this
[1:15:28] world is my
[1:15:30] reputation but Lord if you want to take
[1:15:33] that I give it to you in the name of the
[1:15:35] Lord and when he surrendered he overcame
[1:15:38] that whole battle came out of depression
[1:15:41] amen come back to the front line preach
[1:15:44] predestination preach justification
[1:15:46] preach the truth of the word for that
[1:15:47] day and preach it like nobody else could
[1:15:50] what did he have to do first he had to
[1:15:53] surrender and die
[1:15:55] to
[1:15:58] himself if you love yourself more than
[1:16:01] me you have no part with
[1:16:05] me praise
[1:16:14] God wouldn't it be wonderful if we could
[1:16:17] say that my word and God's word is the
[1:16:21] same what I say he honors it because I
[1:16:24] do nothing until he tells me first it's
[1:16:27] what Jesus said I only do that which the
[1:16:29] father showeth
[1:16:30] me brother B you know in the in the in
[1:16:33] the message from the angel and pick up
[1:16:34] your pen and write that's what he tells
[1:16:36] us the bride is coming to yeah where she
[1:16:38] has his word and his word alone and she
[1:16:40] has thus say at the Lord or she keeps
[1:16:41] still that's right she's coming to the
[1:16:44] place where she only says and does
[1:16:46] what's in the word and what God tells
[1:16:47] her to do amen she's coming to the place
[1:16:50] where you can say my word and God's word
[1:16:51] is the same what I say he honors because
[1:16:54] I do nothing till he tells me first oh
[1:16:57] there is your example there is a life
[1:17:00] worthy of the
[1:17:02] Gospel how do you get there
[1:17:05] surrender through surrender let's turn
[1:17:08] to Hebrews 11 and I want to read this
[1:17:10] last scripture as we
[1:17:13] close Hebrews
[1:17:19] 11 11 and 32
[1:17:29] and what shall I more say for time would
[1:17:32] fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack
[1:17:34] of Samson and jeffa of David also and
[1:17:37] Samuel and of the prophets who through
[1:17:39] faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[1:17:41] righteousness obtained promises stopped
[1:17:43] the mouths of lions quenched the
[1:17:45] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[1:17:47] sword out of weakness were made
[1:17:49] strong wax Valiant in fight turned to
[1:17:52] flight the armies of the aliens women
[1:17:55] received their dead raised to life again
[1:17:57] and others were tortured not accepting
[1:17:59] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[1:18:01] better resurrection and others had trial
[1:18:03] of cruel mockings and scorings yay
[1:18:05] moreover of bonds and imprisonment they
[1:18:07] were stoned they were saw asunder were
[1:18:10] tempted were slain with the sword they
[1:18:12] wandered about in sheep skins and goat
[1:18:14] skins being destitute Afflicted
[1:18:15] tormented of whom the world was not
[1:18:18] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[1:18:20] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[1:18:22] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:18:24] good report through faith receive not
[1:18:26] the promise God having provided some
[1:18:29] better thing for us that they without us
[1:18:31] should not be made
[1:18:33] perfect when you look at this chapter
[1:18:35] The Heroes of
[1:18:38] Faith you know these were all the seed
[1:18:40] of
[1:18:42] God and they all had to forsake forsake
[1:18:46] lands forsake reputation be outcast be
[1:18:50] mocked be scourged be chased they went
[1:18:52] through all of these things but you know
[1:18:55] what the world wasn't worthy of them
[1:18:58] they were the children of God and they
[1:19:00] all lived their Day

[1:19:05] the message and Liv their
[1:19:07] message sir every one of them they what
[1:19:11] God told Abraham he lived it what God
[1:19:12] told David he lived it they lived their
[1:19:14] message and they lived their day and
[1:19:16] they suffered rejection separation and
[1:19:18] everything for it and what carried them
[1:19:20] through nothing more than a seed they
[1:19:22] didn't even have the indwelling of the
[1:19:23] Holy Ghost
[1:19:25] they had the holy ghost that could come
[1:19:27] on them but not in them they were
[1:19:30] empowered by God and moved by God but
[1:19:32] they had a seed inside of them to live
[1:19:34] out the word for their day and they
[1:19:35] became the word
[1:19:39] amen and
[1:19:43] now
[1:19:44] these having attained a good report
[1:19:47] through faith received not the promise
[1:19:50] God having provided some better thing
[1:19:51] for us that they without us should not
[1:19:54] be made perfect perfect brother BM said

[1:20:15] run with patience the race set before us
[1:20:17] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:20:19] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:20:21] that was set before him endured the

[1:21:33] done something extreme in this day
[1:21:35] you've taken the seals off of your book
[1:21:37] you've given us the full revelation of
[1:21:39] the mystery that was in the back part of
[1:21:41] your mind and God when your Prophet came
[1:21:44] to tell us this great mystery he said
[1:21:46] there was one desire you had one thing
[1:21:49] that you wanted to achieve one goal that
[1:21:51] you've had and all the Bible speaking of
[1:21:53] this one goal
[1:21:55] and it comes forth in a three-fold
[1:21:57] manner first you wanted preeminence in a
[1:21:59] man and you accomplish that in Christ
[1:22:01] Jesus but the second part is you want
[1:22:04] preeminence in the people and Lord

[1:22:09] that you might display yourself in Bride
[1:22:11] form that you might come into the lives

[1:22:16] make us worthy of the Gospel that you
[1:22:18] might live the gospel through US Lord

[1:25:12] Manifest this
[1:25:13] word Lord we're so thankful you've
[1:25:15] promised it and you've provided
[1:25:18] it now you're just looking for us to
[1:25:20] receive it and I receive it in the name
[1:25:24] of Jesus Jesus Christ according to the
[1:25:26] promise in your word may your spirit
[1:25:28] envelop me fill me take me under your
[1:25:32] control I don't want to live my own life
[1:25:35] anymore I want to live your
[1:25:37] life oh there's pleasures and desires
[1:25:40] Lord I want them all to fail in
[1:25:43] comparison to my desire for
[1:25:45] you God May everything else fall at your
[1:25:49] feet every desire every want every love
[1:25:54] may it fall at your feet and worship you
[1:25:57] and may you be Lord of all I ask it in
[1:26:00] Jesus Christ's name
[1:26:04] amen you know that picture of the
[1:26:07] scales I'm here Christ so outweighs me I
[1:26:12] can never can never bring it
[1:26:15] equal but if I can just keep emptying
[1:26:18] out and more of him can come
[1:26:21] in bring it a little more then he
[1:26:24] reveals a little more that I need to die
[1:26:26] to and maybe I can get that kicked off
[1:26:28] the scale and that he can fill that void
[1:26:31] and maybe it'll come a little more equal
[1:26:33] and a little more equal and a little
[1:26:34] more equal until we as his people come
[1:26:37] into that image he had of us before the
[1:26:39] foundation the world and our lives
[1:26:42] become worthy equal to in comparison as
[1:26:46] as same value in comparison to the
[1:26:50] gospel may God do it by his power and
[1:26:53] may we surrender and yield to it with
