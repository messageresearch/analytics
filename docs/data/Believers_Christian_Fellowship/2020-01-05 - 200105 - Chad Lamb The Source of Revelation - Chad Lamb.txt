========================================

we is our praise like this place is your presence uh oh praise the lord and he's here because his word said he'd be here we're gathered in his name we know his name amen it there's more than just the characters of the letters of the pronunciation amen we know his name because we know who he is he's revealed himself through his word amen and we just appreciate that and he's he's here to heal and here to save amen this is the part of the service where we invite the lord to speak amen but it's a mystery because he's going to speak through human lips and that through lips of a vessel amen that is born wrong amen and is subject to failure and fault like any other human vessel that's out there but it's his method amen and we've got to look beyond the veil and we've got to have faith in god's method and he's here to heal and he's here to save and if we have confidence in the word of god then we can look beyond the veil of flesh and say god you speak you're here to speak and i'm here to hear and to receive your word amen praise be to god amen it's good to be here amen this is our first sunday service in the new year amendment is 2020 amen perfect vision may god grant that this year we have clear vision that he opens his word like never before and we can see the reality that he wants us to see where we live amen this dimension that we live in is not the reality amen this is just the vapor the mist the reflection of the reality the negative of a positive amen but may he this year let us see the positive more and more and more and more may come into plain view praise be to god let's take our bibles and turn to the book of revelation while you're turning i just want to let you know that um brother yatzik from poland will be coming in on tuesday this week and they'll be taking the wednesday and the sunday service for us and uh this is the brother that i was out brother ben and i had visited when we were uh on the trip in eastern europe last year and so i invited him to come over he's going to take these two services for us so i'm looking forward to that amen so come expecting and let the lord feed his sheep amen but be praying for his travels and pray for his stay while he's here let's look at revelation chapter one verse one i'm going to continue on from where i was two sundays back the last sunday that i ministered i you know we preached and i didn't really finish some of the things that were on my heart and so i thought i'd just pick it up again and continue on let's start here in revelations one and verse one the revelation of jesus christ that is an amazing statement that is an amazing statement now what you're getting ready to read is the revelation of jesus christ so you know horse riders and beasts and and those worshiping around the throne all of this is the revelation of jesus christ the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john man let's bow our heads and ask the lord to bless the reading of his word dear lord jesus we thank you father for this word we thank you god and your grace has brought us to this place god you've brought us here to worship you lord you've brought us here to hear your word you've given us ears to hear and eyes to see and for that we're eternally grateful lord lord we just pray that you would continue to rub the eyes out in our eyes as you continue to unveil yourself through your word god let us see what you it is you want to instruct us in today what it is you want your children to know today for this hour for this moment in time you're accomplishing something lord through your bride and may we catch what you're doing lord and may today you guide us lord by your word give us instruction for living our life lord shape us into the living stones for your temple we love you and ask you to have preeminence here in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated i'm going to pick up this la this same quote that we started with last time out of the revelation of jesus christ from the church age book it says you will recall that i mentioned at the beginning of the message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it there you go bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take disordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear we understand that the the mystery a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear and so just teaching will not bring a mystery clear but teaching of the spirit will bring a mystery clear there's nothing wrong with teaching amen teaching is one of the five-fold ministry gifts teaching is something that we're supposed to do out of the word but teaching alone cannot bring revelation it must come from the spirit of god how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know amen i'm convinced that that revelation is everything i'm becoming more convinced all the time i was convinced before but as we go on i get more convinced and more convinced and more convinced that it's going to require revelation but there's only a special class of people that can receive this revelation of jesus christ that's why this book in the book of revelation is the bride's book because of the revelation of jesus christ it's the capstone book to the entire bible and that capstone set on unlocks the mystery of the entire bible amen which is christ is the mystery of god revealed so it's amazing that what we have in our hands let's turn together to hebrews 11. look at hebrews 11 and we'll look at verse 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for so faith is the substance we have to realize is we're talking in the supernatural spirit realm we're not talking about this dimension that we're in because this dimension we realize is not the real reality this is the vapor this is the myth so we know that this is not the real reality so faith is the substance of things hoped for faith is an actual substance it's not a fleeting thought it's not a funny feeling it's an actual substance and that's why when somebody has faith they have the substance of the things hoped for amen that's why they can rest so solidly on faith which is a revelation amen and they'll not waver they'll not be tossed about because what they have is not an idea what they have is not a thought what they have is substance faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report how did the elders everybody in the old testament all that had come before how did they obtain a good report by faith by faith amen their deeds were just an expression of their faith it wasn't the deeds it was the faith that god respected it was the faith that god honored amen it wasn't what they did amen what they did was only an outcropping of what they believed what they believed moved and then the action to fulfill the word of god and obey the word of god but they could have fulfilled the word and obeyed the word but without faith it would not have given them anything amen as far as merited righteousness because just obedience won't do it alone it has to be by faith so faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen i made a statement last time that that i'd actually picked up from a brother i was speaking to brother i think his brother aaron mcgeary we were having a conversation and he made the statement he says really he says you know revelation the personal revelation is the vindication and when he said it the roman candle started going off because faith is a revelation a revelation is faith amen and faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so now all of a sudden amen challenging brother branham's vindication doesn't do me any harm questioning whether or not 16 men fell off a bridge or questioning what day the cloud showed up or what the cloud was made out of it or all of these other things or the healing of the boy and film the questioning of that does nothing for me because what god has given me by a spirit is substance and evidence so i don't need an evidence of a report i don't need evidence of a photograph i don't need evidence of brother bannon's vindication through scientific sources because what god has given me is evidence so it the faith is not just a thought it's not a fancy notion it's not an agreement amen faith is a substance amen of things hoped for it is the evidence of things not seen amen the only connection that you have amen with the unseen world is by faith and faith is a revelation so now we look at the scripture and realize amen what we should have realized all along that the scripture is right faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and that's why amen if somebody can start to challenge natural evidences and it starts to bring doubt to me it shows amen doubt in my heart not down in your mind down in your mind you remember your mind has nothing to do with your soul doubts can pass through your mind you just reject those things even the devil could put thoughts in your mind he can bring doubts through your mind amen just because the devil put a doubt in your mind that doesn't mean you doubt it in your soul but when when somebody begins to challenge evidences and all of a sudden the challenge of the evidence causes me to doubt in my heart then we realize i must have never had an evidence my own evidence because my own evidence overrides everything else because it's a personal vindication to me that the message is true because by faith amen faith is the substance faith is the evidence so really i don't need anything else [Applause] if you think about what god has done amen god has taken and he's done such a supernatural thing and vindicated the prophet amen so that it will catch our attention amen and in catching our attention the word can be sown into our heart and when the word is sewn into our heart it quickens the seed that is there comes the life amen that is faith that is revelation amen and from that point on amen that was the redemption that was the awakening that was the restoration back to where you'd fallen from and that is the thing that takes control so so the the the vindication that we've seen all the evidences have we seen amen all of those things were in order to to to be the vindication of a prophet so that we could see the vindication of a prophet who would draw our attention to a gift of a prophet so that the word can come and awaken who we really are and restore us as sons and daughters of god back into god is that right and in doing so now we have substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen praise be to god let's keep keep your place in hebrews but flip over to ephesians real quickly for me ephesians 2 we know this scripture so well but i just want to lay it in here while we are here ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8. for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we as was workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god has before ordained that we should walk in them so so the works are not what makes you accepted it's faith we were it's not of works unless did he mention most but we were ordained into good works so god has already known the works that we'll do he's already ordained us to do certain things in the kingdom of god but those doing those things are not those doing those things are not what brings us salvation for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves is the gift of god so we have to make sure we keep the right things in the right order brother said anointed ones at the end time what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god amen let's go back to hebrews with if you can with me look at hebrews 11 4. by faith abel offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh so by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous amen oh praise be to god by faith what moved him to make the right sacrifice the right offering faith which is a revelation abel received a revelation of what god's requirement was and when he caught the revelation and he produced the right the right offering it was a vindication that he was righteous why was he righteous because he believed god is that right abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness right and it's not just for abraham but for all abraham seed that it said it was imputed amen so if you believe god it is imputed unto you for righteousness amen not because of the works the works are only an outcrop of the faith of the belief amen but because abel believed by faith he offered a more excellent sacrifice then cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh amen but the member said in the invisible union of the bride of christ so was cain the prostitutive son very religious built altars and offered sacrifice and paid his tithes and done everything that any other religious man would do but he failed to keep that word he failed to have the revelation where did cain fail cain didn't fail in his desire to worship god he didn't fail in his works towards god amen brother man said he loved god he meant he wanted to worship god and he worked hard he worked harder than abel i think we could say he put more effort into his sacrifice and abel did amen but it didn't matter he failed and where he failed was the realm of faith because he did not have a revelation of the word and abel's revelation of the word amen when he caught the revelation and offered the sacrifice amen it proved he was righteous but when cain could not catch the revelation it was an indication that he was not righteous it wasn't based on works it was based on faith and the revelation is the only thing the revelation of the word what what is a revelation jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you able by faith offered by revelation faith offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain and the message works is faith expressed now faith is a revelation from god now faith is a revelation there's where i want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you never have faith it's given to you by the grace of god and god reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church of god is built upon the revelation now all these quotes i'm going to you are coming out in 1965 amen and most of them are at the end of brother branham's ministry because he's catching he's laying down the fact amen that it's faith in the word of god amen that is proving the royal seed of abraham because the royal seed of abraham could always catch the word of god [Applause] now i want to give a definition to you let me switch over here to another spot in the message the god of this evil age brother brennan makes this statement it's an amazing statement he said in god is the word right and that's not that's not hard for us to believe god is the word amen god is the word but then he may then he's going to define what the word is that's what i like about this quote said for god is the word in the word is the word manifest for the hour and the day. now you realize he just made it he just made that crystal clear god is the word and the word is the word manifest for the hour and the day amen so in order to be in the word you must be in the word that is manifest for the hour and day and the word that is manifest for the hour and day is god and if we want to worship god amen we have to worship him in spirit and in truth by revelation based off the revelation the manifestation of that word for the hour and the day that's why you can be preaching the bible and not preach the word [Applause] you have to have a revelation and you have to know what day you're in and what hour it is and you have to preach the word and manifest in this day and hour amen when when the pharisees were preaching they were preaching the bible but they were not preaching the word john the baptist was preaching the bible and preaching the word amen he was preaching the word which came from the scriptures but he knew the manifestation of the hour in the day that he was in so john was preaching the word the pharisees were preaching the bible [Applause] that's why amen you can just stick with the scriptures and lead people astray [Applause] you just go verse by verse word by word amen you can preach what all the pharisees agree is true and a common belief amen and lead people astray that's what the pharisees were doing [Applause] but to preach the word is different to preach the word you have to catch that scripture that is being manifest in the day and hour which you're alive and that is preaching the word [Music] amen so brother brahm tells us god is the word and the word is the word that is manifest for the day and hour that you're living praise be to god it's exciting friends why is it exciting because that's the substance i have in my heart and that's the evidence i've got of the unseen world that's already mine that's why you can shout amen it's because you've got the substance and you've got the evidence and what's coming through is just striking that substance and striking that evidence and you know it's right you know that's the truth amen that's why they say i just want to preach the bible that's fine there's nothing wrong with preaching the bible but make sure you preach the word amen make sure it's the word you can amen you can do all kinds of things with the bible and come up with all kinds of funny ideas and wrong impressions and you can be preaching somebody completely in the wrong age and in the wrong dispensation with the bible but to preach the truth is to preach the word [Applause] praise be to god in the god of this evil age 1965 and notice cain he didn't want no blood sacrifice he came down and offered the fruit or the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious then everything just exactly like abel done offered a sacrifice fell down before god in worship obedient in every way but without the revelation of the word oh i hope we can catch this cain was super religious [Applause] cain was working his religion cain if we could put it in modern terms cain was at every service [Applause] [Music] he was amen he was in obedience that's what brother bram says he said he was obedient in every way but without the revelation of the word there's going to come a separation through cain and abel amen and the separation always comes the same way god never come down amen and just said you're you're the good one you're the bad one no sir now he didn't do with esau and jacob he didn't do it with cain and abel amen he didn't do it with jesus and judas amen god knew who was who from before the foundation of the world but he's going to bring a revelation of his word and a revelation of his word is going to separate out the two seed lines because the true seed can catch the revelation of the word and the false seed cannot and so always it's the revelation of the word that brings separation amen it's not anybody deciding you're in your own remember the wheat pulls away from nobody the wheat doesn't go anywhere the wheat's always here amen everybody's welcome everybody's accepted remember the bride says revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come they don't say go amen the bride is not separating by her own reasoning by her own thinking amen she's not got the ministry of separating amen she's got the ministry of reconciliation [Applause] and she's saying come come to the word come to the fountain come and drink amen but it's the revelation of the word that's bringing the separation let's read this again very religious done everything just exactly like abel done offered a sacrifice fell down before god in worship obedient in every way but without the revelation of the word and the word was from the beginning god's plan oh praise god this is so good friends the word was from the beginning god's plan what bible was able reading amen the word was god's plan from the beginning even when it wasn't written yet it was a revelation of the word even before it was written what bible was abraham reading but abraham was declared righteous because he believed the word what word the word god spoke to him that was revealed to him and the hour that he was alive amen and the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that that was right so god revealed it amen when they did it he punctuated it was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god now we should belong to church we should be sincere we should make a sacrifice right those are not evil things amen but cain had all of that but he had no he could not receive revelation on the word and he was the false vine abel amen he may not have done those things as well as cain did them he may not have been as faithful as cain was faithful to all the ordinances but one thing he could do was catch a revelation from god not making a sacrifice not being sincere you're supposed to be sincere but sincerity alone won't do it but by the revelation of the word of god why because faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen praise be to god 1956 father the hour has come all the way back in 56 i want you to hear this quote now watch him when it was a class in then it was class and cain come anointed with satan and made a great big classical thing but now abel when he come he never come in class but he come in revelation the bible said in hebrews 3 that abel by faith offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain and the only way he did it was by faith and faith in what the word of god because that's the only thing you can have faith in god had revealed to him that it was the blood and cain had a beautiful offering yet not covered in blood and abel didn't have a beautiful offering but it was covered in blood and it was according to the word and god recognized it because it was his word amen you realize it wasn't just the blood amen offering the blood was indication he received the word and when he believed the word he offered the blood it wasn't just the blood it was the revelation of the word and the revelation of the word had him bring a blood sacrifice and god saw that he got the word and he proved he was righteous the blood didn't make him righteous his faith made him righteous and his faith in the word of god made him produce a blood sacrifice [Applause] amen there's no way that you can believe hey there's no way that you can believe this message and not do the word right so it doesn't say i believe i believe but i'm not going to do now when cain believed he did when abraham believed he did amen when when everybody believed they did they obeyed the word they did what the word revealed so there's not there's no way saying i believe the message of the hour but we won't even line up to the message of the hour to what the prophet taught us that doesn't work either but the works are a vindication of the faith but the works lining up will never bring redemption lining up will never declare us righteous only faith will [Applause] that's why brother bram says faith and works as husband and wife they go together amen and it was according to the word and god recognized it because it was his word and today god's not watching the great big church it's built its biggest builder and the choir can sing and or all this other all this and the other or what class of people whether they were well dressed or not well dressed in your church he's not looking for such things as that no not by a million miles he's not he's watching for someone to come the way of the blood revelation hear what he said he's watching for somebody to come the way of the blood revelation and abel by faith he heard the word of god and took god at his word and by faith in the word of god god received him how did god receive him by faith in his word that's the only way god will ever receive anybody is by taking god at his word by revelation that god will keep his word so so now we realize that that cain cain could not receive revelation abel had something cain didn't have but brother ben said they had the same religious instruction they grew up in the same home with the same instruction from mother and father i personally i don't believe that they knew there was anything different they thought they thought adam and eve were mom and dad and they both thought the same thing they grew up as brothers they had the same teaching in the same home the same influences amen they eat the same food they did the same thing all the way through but there was one thing that god was going to use to separate the true and false vine and that was going to be revelation of the word and they heard the same stories over and over again and you know they they heard the story of well you know what the garden used to be like and we were in the garden and now we've been expelled from the garden because we made a mistake and can you imagine amen brother banner said abel got a revelation of serpent seed it wasn't because his mother told him you understand she didn't tell him what did they know we were told not to eat of this tree and we ated that tree and all of this happened and now it's coming time to offer a sacrifice cain knows it's time abel knows his time but something's bothering abel abel doesn't know what god wants cain doesn't care what god wants [Applause] cain is using reasoning to decide what god wants so cain is deciding god would like this kind of worship and but but all cain was doing was saying i like it god will like it cain was offering what he liked he was offering what he thought was beautiful he was offering what he thought was great but he wasn't offering what god wanted abel i mean he abel might have been simple-minded i mean if he matched all the other christians down through the age he was you know he wasn't the intellectual that would have been king but abel just something wouldn't set right in his heart it's coming time to worship god and i want to worship god but what does god want oh that's a good question what does god want you know not what i want to give him but what does god actually want you know there's so much worship in the world today and it's nothing more than the manufacture of a man's mind what he thinks god would want god would like this and god would want this and it's really just what he wants and that's cain worship according to reasoning according to what a man wants to give god amen but abel wanted to give god what god wanted but abel didn't know what god wanted so that means nobody told him what kind of sacrifice to give adam didn't tell him eve didn't tell him nobody told him so i can imagine abel just meditating on that this is just me if you'll give me that liberty just meditating what does god want what should i do and he could see cain i mean cain had to work a long time so it was no mystery what cain was doing cain was really laboring to build a nice altar and hew the stone out and plant the garden and the vegetables and tend to them and keep the flowers and it was obvious cain's working working working working and abel's really not doing anything so i'm sure kane is getting a little puffed up think surely i mean i'm working in april hasn't even started god's gonna love what i'm doing oh friends nothing's changed nothing's changed from the very onslaught of time till now nothing's changed wasn't doing anything and just just sitting there and waiting what are you waiting for i don't know why don't you just plant a garden why don't you just something in me see friends this is our life this is the way we're supposed to live i just don't know i'm uneasy i don't know what god wants i'm waiting what are you waiting for i don't know what i'm waiting for i'm just not sure we'll build an altar plan a garden i just i can't it doesn't feel right to me you see how ridiculous this is to the carnal mind to the intellectual but this is the life that we're supposed to be living friends this is what he's calling us to aim in a life led by revelation by the spirit of god amen god dealing with us not through our mind but through our hearts just don't feel right about it how many times have we pushed past something we weren't comfortable with because of our reasoning and then later regretted it how many times did we get a certain feeling a certain notion amen and we overrode it with reasoning and later we realized i missed god i gotta let reasoning fall away and say god just lead me by your spirit i can imagine cain or abel going back to mom and dad tell me that story again tell me that story again and he gets the same story he already got because the words in the bible are never changing the ink blot on paper is not changing so he's going back and he's hearing the same story and he may ask a question well what about this and and all of a sudden cain hears the story again and he's just not something in him it's just something there's something there you ever felt like there's just something there at your fingertips you just can't wrap your hand around it something god wants something god's moving in my heart there's something in the word i just can't seem to get it amen mabel may have been in one of those spots tell me the story again and okay donated this tree and we ated this tree and daddy to this tree and and you made aprons of fig leaves yes and you hid from god god came to you and then there was a judgment and the serpent was judged to crawl on his belly we were cast out of the garden and shortly after that cain came and i came abel's just going huh cain's like what's the big deal we've heard that 100 times just plant a garden hue out some stone come on it's time to worship kane got just enough of the story amen to just move forward i mean it didn't mean anything to him it was a story might as well made flannel graphs out of it and taught it to the kids it was just a story nothing more faith value you know what cain would do amen cain would only believe the literal interpretation of the words [Music] and cain would only take it at face value there's a lot of canes around but abel started thinking and meditating and i can imagine one day amen god in his sovereign grace he quickens the revelation to him and all of a sudden abel's like i got it don't eat the tree the serpent was the serpent was like us you fell made fig leaves cast out of the garden and we came i got it and what did god do what did god do and he runs back mom mom dad tell me that story again okay yeah i got that i got that buttercup what happened after god pronounced judgment well he took a lamb and he slayed it and he killed it he made us a covering i got it now i know what god wants now i know why now i know why he killed a lamb now i know why he shed blood now i know why he covered your body now i know what god wants what did abel have to do in order to get this revelation abel had to read between the lines abel had to catch the mysterious part of the story he had to catch the mystery that was laying between the details and when he caught the mystery laying between the details all of a sudden he caught i understand why we're here i know why we're out of the garden i know why god slayed a lamb and i know what is the acceptable path to god [Applause] and when abel caught that revelation by faith it proved that according to the book of hebrews he was righteous [Applause] what's the difference between the righteous of the unrighteous line the ability to receive revelation on the word of god you see friends abel's now abel's offering vindicated his face and then god vindicated his offering and backed it up and it all proved that abel was righteous see for us it's revelation not by church attendance not by being a good boy or being a good girl or doing everything right that's not it it's by revelation the thing has been revealed to us we know amen we know what the word is for this day and hour not for another day and hour for this day and hour we have caught the revelation of the word we know who is here we know what this is all about we know who the bride is amen we know what the bride is failing by revelation not by education by revelation and when the revelation comes and strikes the heart all of a sudden i get it i understand i know why the seals had to be opened i know all of these things why because he's revealed it to me we read the same story over and over and over again just like cain and abel got the same story over and over and over again but there's one time amen all of a sudden it wasn't just the story anymore it wasn't just the details anymore all of a sudden we realized what this whole bible is all about and why i'm on this earth and where i came from and where i'm going and what he's doing now [Applause] in the revelation amen produces from out from the faith comes the works and it's a clear indication of what we believe and proves that we are righteous let's go to hebrews 11 back to hebrews 11 and verse 6. hebrews 11 and 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him without faith it is impossible to please him all the correct works in the world without faith will not please him let's just put it this way by intellectual understanding recognizing the message is true and reading all the message books and coming to church all the time will not please him it won't please him faith will please you not just doing a set of works because we mentally acknowledge it's probably right or we were taught to do this as a child or this is what we've always done or these are a wonderful group of people i'll go along with them that won't work it's got to be an individual revelation by faith and faith proves that you're righteous so without faith it is impossible to please him so the works won't do it the church attendants won't do it but we should attend church we should do good works we're not against any of those but get a revelation that's the thing that pleases god he says and i'm going to just go back let's go back to back to verse 1. hebrews 11 and 1. i'd like to add this now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen that's that's become even a better scripture for me than it was before i liked it better before i mean i liked it good before it's the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of the things which do appear brother branham picks up this verse and he says see god spoke and he had to believe his own word i'll make this statement i hope you follow my thinking and don't think i'm saying anything wrong but it wasn't just the spoken word that created everything it was god's faith in that spoken word that created everything because the scripture said through faith we understand the world's refrained by the word of god god spoke but then he had to believe his own word and it came to pass now see god amen was demonstrating for us what his children would do because if that's what the father does that's what the children should do and i want to say it this way brother branham manifesting the third pull speaking squirrels into existence isn't what brought squirrels into existence it's his faith in what he spoke because if he didn't believe it there'd be no squirrels that's why so many times amen we use prayer almost like a prayer book or we pray and it's almost like we're reading prayers out of a prayer book or our magic spell book that if we say these certain words and you can say all the words you want you can pray the most beautiful prayer but if you don't believe what you're saying you will not get what you're asking for there's a lot of beautiful prayers and it's almost like there's merit and a beautiful prayer there's no merit in a beautiful prayer it's not the words that are making a difference it's faith in the words it's faith in what we're saying faith in what we're asking for believing that god's going to give it to us because his word says so and it's faith that apprehends the promise not the prayer the prayer is an expression of our faith but you can have a prayer without faith and that prayer will produce nothing but a prayer that's an expression of faith will apprehend the promise because everything is apprehended by faith everything in the kingdom of god is apprehended by faith i mean how many times did jesus say be it unto you according to thy faith as thou has believed so let it be you know it's always by your faith by your faith by your faith he goes into a village and he heals all the sick and afflicted and lame and hall all that they brought to them he healed he goes to capernaum and he could not do their many mighty works because of their unbelief it was the same lord jesus with the same power and the same ability the same hands the same everything the difference was the faith in the heart of the people so it's not saying beautiful prayers amen it's not even saying what the tapes say [Applause] [Music] you were supposed to say what the tapes say but if we don't believe what the tapes are saying what good is saying what the tapes say we say what the tapes say amen in our faith in what we're saying amen brings it to pass [Applause] it's our faith we can say what the tapes say but that's not imputed unto us for righteousness saying what the tapes say there's no imputation of righteousness amen not even doing what the tapes say all right the tapes say you should be in church every time the door is up i'm in church every time the door's open there's no imputation of righteousness for that we understand the scriptures abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness by faith are we saved through grace and that none of ourselves is the gift of god not of works lest any men should boast it wasn't the works it was the faith it's not just saying what the tapes say and doing what the tape says because if there's no revelation in the heart on what we're doing no faith it will not impute righteousness unto us amen that's the difference between a genuine revelation and intellectual understanding we can catch an intellectual understanding amen but intellectual understanding is not the substance of things so foreign and not the evidence of things unseen at some point the intellectual can come unraveled but the evidence and the substance will never never get unraveled new information won't change substance and evidence more details more eyewitnesses amen more speculation and more controversy it doesn't matter once you have the substance and evidence nothing outside is going to change anything because the substance and evidence is in here and i have the substance of things so i'm actually holding it i actually have it amen it's not a mist it's not a vapor it's a substance and if we have it it's just as real as real is real amen the faith that i have in my heart is more real than this natural life that i'm living on the earth because i know that this life could be snuffed out at any moment and therefore i fear no more death because the substance that i have in my heart will take me beyond the boundaries of human life and take me to the place where i came from from the eternal you realize faith overcomes every obstacle the scripture says this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith our works don't do it our mind won't do it amen not no cunning no ability will ever overcome the world what overcomes the world our faith right this is the victory over come with the world if we're being overcome by the world in our personal life it shows there's something in the faith realm that's got to come higher amen because this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith we've got to believe [Applause] amen revelation comes from god but there's got to be a receiver on the inside there's got to be a predestinated eternal sea gene of god on the inside cain didn't have it abel had it and in the message anointed one's at the end time it says the only way that the one that was receiving could have done anything different from his brother it was revealed to him for the bible said by faith hebrews 11 chapter by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified that he was righteous jesus said the spiritual revelation of who he was who does man say that i the son of man am he said said peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god blessed out thou art thou simon son of jonas flesh and blood never revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church the true revelation of the word there is the true vine again able by faith what happened when peter made that declaration it proved he was the true vine yeah he would later make a mistake he wouldn't deny the lord he would have to be converted amen but his declaration of faith proved that he was the true vine even though later he acted like he wasn't amen because it wasn't based on his conduct he got this revelation he said there are christ the son of the living god amen the very next thing jesus begins to explain to them how he must go to jerusalem and be evilly treated and persecuted and killed and on the third day raise again and peter said far be it from thee he took him aside and rebuked the lord and he looked at him and says get the behind me satan he just got a revelation of the lord proving that he was the righteous seed of abraham amen and he turns around and the lord says get thee behind me satan amen you see it's not based off conduct based off faith faith will absolutely produce a conduct but it's based off faith in the rapture message he said but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her have you caught the revelation are the rapture cycles on are you being caught up word by word amen if we can't receive revelation guess what there'll be no translation of the body [Music] if we cannot receive revelation there will be no translation of the body because it's a revelation unto her so the group thing was going to fail that day the mental agreement the intellectual acknowledgement it'll all fall down on that day because it's an individual revelation amen that's going to bring about a translation of the body a change in the atoms so credit for church attendance won't work for a body change never cutting your hair won't work for a body change you understand this by revelation it's the only way the body's going to change is the only absolute only way is by revelation we better learn to operate in realms of in revelation we better get comfortable with divine revelation from the father amen and it's not good enough to say well my church believes that don't mean anything don't somebody ask you what you believe don't say my church believes don't say my pastor teaches or my church believes oh my goodness amen that matters for not what do you believe jesus said whom do men say that i am some say are liath some say who do you say that i am right who do you say this is what is this message amen what is this bride coming of christ what is who do you say it is remember judas could go along so far amen judas could amen he could believe in the supernatural amen he could get a part of the ministry amen he could be instructed by jesus christ he could heal the sick amen he could be the money back holder amen and be the treasurer for the ministry he could do everything but when it got up to the end the prophet of god said he just couldn't see that man being gone what was the separating point revelation when was judas separated out revelation he just couldn't see that man being god [Applause] amen judas was religious judas was great judas was wonderful amen judas had a fantastic ministry judas was a fantastic brother nobody was suspecting judas was a judas i mean the term judas wasn't bad it was a good term before everybody wanted to be a judas one of the twelve amen the one god trusted with the money bag amen the one with a fantastic ministry of healing and deliverance amen everybody wanted to be a judas when he went out to betray the lord amen he had such a relationship with jesus christ that when he went out to betray the lord they assumed that the lord had sent him to go buy something some bison how much relationship did jesus and judas had if that's what the disciples assumed was going on but judas just could only go so far but there come a point to the greatest revelation of all and he couldn't catch it he just couldn't see that man being god and he could betray him he could later repent but the repentance did him no good he could try but it didn't do him any good because he didn't have anything to believe with i read to you out of the god of this evil age brother said god is the word and the word is the word made manifest in this day and hour what is the word bride the manifestation of this day i just put these two quotes together let's go through it again yes sir god is the word the word is the word made manifest in this day and hour what is the word bride the manifestation for this hour did you catch it there's going to be some who go along with church order go along with holiness go along with god sent a prophet but they won't be able to go there when you begin to say my father and i are one and them other things then the shuck begins to pull away there was one place judas couldn't go judas couldn't look at that man and recognize that man was god [Applause] there's people on the earth that just can't believe that the bride is veiling the godhead that just can't believe behind that flesh is god working in this day is the manifestation of the godhead is the word amen in complete fulfillment of the new testament in this body of belief they can look at the flesh but they just can't go there [Applause] amen it's going to require a revelation friends and not an understanding not a group theology amen not a church attendance it's going to be more than saying i believe the message amen you're going to have to recognize what the message really is praise be to god and that can only be by revelation because it blows up the intellectual mind amen it's not reasonable it doesn't make any sense but it's the truth of the bible amen amen finish this rapture quote the bride of christ will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture now it's a revelation for the revelation is faith you cannot have revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to abraham you could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it was not wasn't so now faith that's what faith is the revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body i'll ask you the same question this bride of jesus christ whom do men say it is what do men say it is oh it's a good group of believers they're nice people they're holy clean living moral people it's more than that it's more than that brother them said moses was christ in his day why because he was the word main manifest the word made man of the anointed word made manifest is christ amen praise be to god amen christ is the mystery of god revealed look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ is that true christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do who do you say this is what is this message what did this message come to do it come to call out a bride and unite the bride of christ together you write the bride with the headship now where is the headship in the bride [Applause] amen i want to read that again because i like it so much christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do what is the new birth then you said well brother branham what is the new birth it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you i want to tell you that's not jesus christ in his ministry by the sea of galilee it's the word manifest in this day and hour [Applause] amen that's the truth that's the way it's always been right what has every believer in the bible had to believe they had to believe the word made manifest in their day and hour previous manifestations they had to believe that too but redemption amen was always brought about by believing the the message for their current day amen the word made flesh in their day that was the requirement amen to be part of the righteous line and that came by revelation because the rest of the world missed it what is the new birth then you say well brother brendon what is the new birth it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you set a creed you promised to live by a coat of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon christ where christ in you the hope of glory that's the manifestation of the word in this hour christ in you christ and a many member bride amen the god the capstone has come down and united in an invisible union with the bride and he is here he is present now where is he he's in his bride that's the manifestation to reject her is to reject him to reject that is to reject the word because god is the word and the word is the word manifest for this day and hour what is the man what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour oh praise be to god to reject that is to reject life [Applause] that is the manifestation that's what the message is praise be to god further in christ is the mystery of god revealed and here he is today in the same manner by the same pillar of fire expressing himself vindicating himself the same revealing the mystery of god that's been hid since the foundation of the world see it paul only knew him by revelation peter knew him by revelation peter knew him in the flesh but that wasn't good enough peter knowing him in the flesh caused him to deny the lord and run out and have to repent but peter had to know him by revelation not just by flesh he walked with him talked with him therefore you can set this word now i've just said that he was the word now a scholar can sit down and read that word till he can just tie your mind up anyway see if he wants to do it because he's smart brilliant get a catholic priest or not so much that or a real good trained theologian in the bible brother a baptist or a presbyterian or something he'll make you think you don't know nothing see when it comes to talk what see because that he was known him in the flesh the word brother brennan pat's his bible he didn't say that that was interjected and knowing by what they know him by the written word the only way to know him is by the living word see they know him in the flesh the word but the only way you're saved is by know him by revelation praise be to god amen he says and who is this melchizedek i said then there's no way for god to ever get to you somebody said i don't believe in revelation he said there's no way for god to ever get to you because it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prude and revealed to babes revealed revelation revealed to babes such as will accept it learn and i said there be no way for god to get to you you close yourself off from him the whole bible is the revelation of god the whole church is built upon the revelation of god there is no other way to know god only by revelation to whom the son will reveal him revelation everything is revelation got that revelation is everything everything is revelation i'd like for you to turn to genesis 24 with me we all know this so super well but i just want to i want to read it together and talk about this genesis 24 and we'll start at verse 10. this is eleazar going out to fetch a bride for isaac and he says and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master when his hand he arose and went to mesopotamia into the city of nehorn and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water and he said oh lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters and men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy picture i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camel's drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has showed kindness into my master and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebecca came out who was born to bethuel son of milka the wife of nehor abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy picture and she said drink my lord and she hastened and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him drink and when she had done giving him drinks she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they had done drinking and she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and ran again into the well to draw water and drew for all the camels and we know this story really well eliezer's been sent and brother branham's ministry was the type of eliezer eliezer brother man was sent to fetch a bride amen for the promised son and and now he's in the same ministry here and he comes to the well and he says he begins to pray oh lord prosper my journey amen and he doesn't know who the woman is he's got to go get the bride but he doesn't know who the bride is oh this is good friends the prophet of god was sent to fetch a bride but i mean there's denominations and systems and people ever who's the bride how will i identify the bride how will i know who the bride is and this eleazar he's got this problem there's probably plenty of virgins there's probably plenty of women here amen how will i know which is the right choice amen to which is the chosen bride for isaac who do i pick how do i find her you realize it's not any meanie-minding mode it's not intellectual reasoning that's going to get it done there's no choosing by a man's mind there's no saying she's probably it or she's probably not amen he was going to do something he was going to rely on the supernatural to provide a bride and he began to say not just the one that gives me drink but the one to give my camel's drink amen and when he before he was done speaking rebecca began to come i want to ask you amen why was rebecca walking to the well at that moment i don't think they had clocks [Music] i don't i mean she was probably pretty accurate at telling by the sun and the certainty i have no idea but i doubt she knew at the minute you know she just went to the well that's what she does she goes to the well maybe she just felt to go early that day or late i don't know something moved her and she went and moved eleazar and eleazar is praying a specific prayer i don't know who to pick but let the one who can catch revelation be the one let the one who can catch the unspoken part the thing that i'm not allowed to say let that be the bride your brother ben's got just as difficult a job as eliezer had he mean he's got to fetch a bride amen he's here to call out a bride to call her out of the nominational systems and call her out amen to be prepared to meet the lord amen who's it going to be how is he going to find them amen all he's got to do is give out the word amen and the one that can catch the unspoken part the one that can read between the lines the one that can receive revelation from heaven amen rebecca may not have even known she was receiving revelation from heaven because god had already chosen her and inside her is a certain nature a certain attribute seed of god and god is going to move eleazar and eliezer is going to make a certain request but what he's looking for is the one with that certain nature amen that's not just going to water the man because he asked that it'll go beyond just what he asked and see have eyes to see oh he's thirsty oh there's camels oh what was it it was a perfect setup to draw the life out of the seed that was already there so she just began to water she may not have known it might have just been an impression it might have just been a thought in her heart it might have just been a little prick in her heart how many times has this happened to us we not realize it's the it's god moving us supernaturally there had to be a supernatural element to the choosing of a bride and in this day there's a supernatural element to the choosing of a bride amen you may not have known the moment when you realized this was truth and then all of a sudden something just kept moving you kept moving you and there was some certain thing on that tape that you were just drawn to there was something going on that amen despite your intellectual reasoning despite the fear but something inside amen i know it was for me it was like something that hooked into me and was reeling me in against my will what was it there was a certain nature coming across that tape and there was a certain nature in me and they were coming together like that it was irresistible and then it wasn't intellectual because sometimes your mind is screaming no this can't be no it can't be like this but something your heart is saying amen amen amen then you come to the preaching of the seventh seal and brother branham comes up to the preaching of the seven seal and he says i feel to stop right there have the vision of the three polls and when he gets to the third poll he says now don't say nothing about this one when this one starts it'll be a total secret you explain the others don't explain this why because this is going to be the choosing of the bride and there's going to be a supernatural element to the choosing of the bride it's going to be the one that can catch the unspoken part it's going to be like abel the one who can hear the same story read the same scriptures know the same details but all the sudden in the flash he has a completely different conclusion he knew what cain knew amen all of a sudden he had a different conclusion than what cain had what was that revelation why because he had the ability to receive brother bannon says in god's provided way of healing from 1954 it says now when you receive the inspiration that jesus christ died for your sickness it's the very hour that your healing has come that's right when you receive from heaven that jesus died for your sins and you have accepted it you don't need any prayer for you then you already accepted it it's settled now we can preach the word explain the word but you have to receive the word it's different it says we can preach the word explain the word but you have to receive the word that's the supernatural part we can preach it we can explain it we should do that but you have to receive it oh hallelujah that's what sets it a fire brother when you receive it the revelation listen what he says something slips out of the unseen world yonder comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul oh i'm going to read that again we think you know something just happened all of a sudden ping it's like it popped in my mind no there was something taking place he said when you receive it the revelation something slips out of the unseen world yonder comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul that says now i see it your eyes brighten your lips that hung down straighten up and smile every muscle in your body seems to rejoice something's going to happen you don't need to be in a prayer line then you've got it then amen something from over yonder in the unseen world begins to tumble down through a mystical channel and drops into your soul amen and then what happens all the rejoicing that starts then then you begin to smile then you begin to rejoice because it's real to you amen it's a faith as a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen when that certain something begins to roll from the unseen world and roll down through a mystical channel and drop into your soul amen and you say i see it all the rejoicing that should take place friends because you realize that's the substance that's the evidence nothing will change that it's a revelation of the word it's more than an understanding it's more than an excellent mental exercise it didn't come from the preacher it came from the unseen world [Applause] amen then there's still preaching that needs to be done there's still tapes that need to be listened to but it wasn't the tape playing that did it it wasn't the preaching that did it amen that only put a hunger in your heart for it that was only an awakening amen but something had to come from the unseen world and tumbled down through a mystical channel do you believe there's still a mystical channel that can drop revelation right into your soul do you believe that there's a connection amen if you've ever had a mystical channel you still got a mystical channel a connection between you and the unseen world and it's a mystical channel that something can drop down into your soul and you say i see it not into your brain into your soul and when it drops down then your eyes begin to lighten amen your lip hung down begin to curve up to a smile you begin to rejoice because now you've got the substance you've got the evidence everything's going to be okay that's why for me amen i get so discouraged when i find myself amen falling back on old habits of complaining and old habits of feeling sorry for myself and old habits of saying woe is me my goodness there's been something that tumbled out of heaven from the unseen world and it's come down through a mystical channel and dropped into my heart and i know who i am i know where i came from i know why i'm on earth i know where i'm going god forgive me forever complaining i'm as happy as happy can be in the midst of the trial in the midst of a jail cell in the midst of a sickness nothing's going to change that revelation and who cares if i'm sick every day of my life and die nothing will change the fact i'm a son of god i'm an eternal creature amen what happens to the outside man has no effect on what's going on in the inside man that's the control tower that's what's received revelation and now you can't hurt me you can't hurt me you can't stop me amen you can put me in prison if god wants me there i'll stay if he wants me out i'll get out [Applause] read the bible a demon of sickness can enter in through a weakness in the flesh and lodge itself in my body and i can begin to get sick in the outer man and if god wants me there amen to display his character and his word i'll stay right there but if god doesn't want me there that sickness will not stay [Applause] amen and the outside man now doesn't matter anymore to me amen this thing's going to burn amen it's going to be changed it's going to go to a grave whatever's going to happen to it now is inconsequential because something tumbled down out of the unseen world through a mystical channel and logs into my heart and i am so satisfied with that revelation now it does not matter to me what happens to this body it belongs to god i'm part of the plan i'm part of the program you know why we complain so bad amen why because we get spiritual amnesia and we forget that i'm part of the program that this vessel is the one he chose to be part of the manifestation of the word in this day and age and that is the revelation of christ in this day [Applause] when we begin to feel depressed and melancholy and feel sorry for ourselves amen it's because spiritual amnesia creeps back in and we forgot that i've been born for a purpose i've been placed on this earth in a specific time i have come from god and i go to god and god is accomplishing something right this moment in my life i tell your friends that changes all the circumstances [Applause] it's joy unspeakable and full of glory that's why the apostle paul and silas could sing in a prison cell because they were in the will of god they were working out the plan of god and nothing was happening to them outside of the program of god [Applause] oh we need to stay connected to this invisible channel and man it'll take care of all kinds of problems problems will come they're meant to come amen that word in you has to be on display through every kind of situation imaginable to man you're there's going to be sickness there's going to be disasters there's going to be financials there's going to be whatever's going to happen because that word in you has to be on display through every obstacle and everything the devil can throw at it there's got to be a proof that the word overcomes so now all of a sudden i don't care about the obstacle amen because now this is something god wants to defeat through this tabernacle this is something god wants to display himself mighty amen through this tabernacle he wants the word to be displayed through this tabernacle i've been bought with the price i've got my own i belong to him [Music] see revelation changes everything it fixes our anxiety it fixes our fear it fixes our depression it fixes our melancholy attitude amen revelation fixes everything and you can still get down brother benham got down what brought him out revelation [Applause] amen god had to speak to him through the channel snap him out of it we can still get down but god's gonna have to speak to that channel snap us out of that recognize my life is not just a set of circumstances that's happening to me my steps are ordered of the lord hey man how about this morning just open yourself up and let something from the unseen world tumble down through a mystical channel and drop into your soul and say all is well with me everything is fine nothing's out of kilter the program's moving on and satan's not going to stop the program of god in my life because by revelation not by intellectual stimulation but by revelation i know i'm part of the program where is the word today [Applause] man it's not the flesh it's the word amen inside directing the flesh the flesh is only reflecting the life that's on the inside this ain't it it's got to be changed but the real genuine me is that attribute from god that's been quickened in the soul and it's the watchtower controlling this guy that's the word made flesh today [Applause] god is the word and the word is the word man manifest in this day and hour what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour you got it right what are we afraid of where's the problem i don't see a problem the revelation took care of the problem are bad things happening sure bad things are happening will bad things happen sure if you consider them bad maybe they just look bad but they're really good amen when they passed the decree that daniel couldn't pray anymore that looked like a bad thing oh but that was a good thing it was that very decree that was going to eliminate all the enemies that daniel had in the court of the king they had done it to eliminate daniel and god had allowed it to eliminate them amen praise be to god we should be the most secure people that have ever walked the face of the earth there should be nothing that makes us insecure no fear no no threats no amen how can you get insecure i mean you're outside man it feels it but you got to bring that subject to the inside man and say wait a second buddy we're not going to get scared we're not going to get nervous amen because i know whom i belong to i know whom i'm i belong to whose i am oh praise me to god it's the revelation something slips out of the unseen world you're under i i could say that a thousand times and be just as excited why because you've experienced it why are you so excited because you know what that is it's happened to you something has just hit where did it come from the unseen world amen it wasn't really what the preacher said it was the realization that took place in my heart something slipped out of the unseen world comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul that says now i see it amen jehovah jiren 1964 he says now we notice no matter what the others done how they walked away these disciples were predestinated they were ordained to eternal life no they couldn't explain it they couldn't explain it no more than the rest of them could but there was something in them that representation in heaven oh i like that they had something in them that was also representation in heaven amen they were just as secure as could be their position was already secure before the lord called them out they were secure eternal security is not hard to believe my name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world he was the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world eternal security is not based off my calling eternal security went way back before my calling before jesus amen looked at peter and andrew said come follow me i'll make these fishers of men he's eternal his eternal destination was already secure and when we catch this revelation it should take away insecurity amen but there was something in them that that representation in heaven a thought that god had of them before the foundation of the world had manifested itself here and they were connected with god and was sure that was god's promise vindicated promised vindicated and nothing is going to change it from them that's real genuine christianity that's real genuine christianity what's real genuine christianity something in you that's representation in heaven and you're linked to god we're in his thoughts before the foundation of the world and that's real genuine christianity brother graham says in identification of christ in all ages speaking of the little woman at the well he says look at that little woman see she had fallen from god's thoughts oh i love that quote she had fallen from god's thoughts amen if you had fallen from god's thoughts guess what you're still connected you didn't fall too far you're still connected amen she had fallen from god's thoughts she could be redeemed she could be redeemed she was a subject realize she didn't become a subject she was already a subject i want to say it this way you didn't become a child of god you didn't become a message believer [Applause] because believing the message has nothing to do with your brain you realize your brain will fade away this body has to be changed you were a message believer before you realized you were a message because the message is the word is that right it's the word and you were already the word and in you was a part of the word now when i say in you as a part of the word i want to be careful how we understand that it's not like i have a chunk of something and i lop off a little block of it and now i've got this and this is different than that [Music] brother bam described it this way go to the ocean and dip out a dip of ocean water now everything that's in the ocean is in this in a portion so we have the very dna of god [Applause] what is the dna spiritual dna what is the spiritual dna of god the word god is the word the whole word and what's in you the word but there's a portion of that word for us to display in this day but that's why it's not hard for us to believe the whole word it's already in us from before the foundation of the world it's already there by predestination an attribute of god amen every cell you got has the same dna amen every cell you've got has the same dna that makes up your whole body is made up by dna and all that information is in every cell praise be to god that's why it's not hard to believe the whole word because the believing is already inside it's already there faith by grace what is grace predestination his love for his bride he's already chosen he's already predestinated that seed has already been predetermined to come in this time its destiny is already secure eternal security is not a doctrine it's a reality and i'm living the reality of eternal security you can't make me insecure you can try to make my flesh insecure but the word will overcome that amen let's read this again she had fallen from god's thoughts she could be redeemed why she had to be somewhere to be redeemed back she could be redeemed she was a subject she had representation in heaven she turned around look at the difference between her and them preachers her priests them preachers when they saw it they said well this man is a fortune teller they didn't know the word they knew the bible but the man tells us they could take a scroll of the book of bible roll it up stick a pen and tell you all the letters and the words that that pierced they knew the bible they didn't know the word amen oh praise the god praise be to god possessing the gate of the enemy after the trial 1964 if the world falls on the the word falls on the fertile ground like the little woman at the well she understood she was represented in heaven from before the foundation of the world when that light struck it she recognized it when that light struck you why did you recognize it because you have representation in heaven there's a mystical channel between you and the unseen world to receive revelation it's there friends that's where it comes from he says and who is this melchizedek then after you recognize the very word of god was eagle food then you left the other thing you have then been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany if this earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting praise god if you if you kill this one it don't matter i got another one all of this is oh this is just changing the outer garment amen you destroy this one i got another one when brother brennan went beyond the curtain of time and saw that amen he says i'll never fear death no more just from stepping from one thing to the other so what if i go bankrupt i not a child of god is god not in control anymore is he not accomplishing something through my life praise be to god we gotta let god be god and have faith have real faith not just faith i believe the bible verse this this and this now i believe the word and the word is on display the word is being fleshed out through me i believe the word it's more than just accepting a bible verse it's accepting the reality of that verse made flesh in me and i believe that word i believe that manifestation and i believe god's in complete control amen brother man says in proving his word he goes back to this woman at the well he said you've told the truth because you had five and the one you know have is not your husband watch something happen see something took life now if it hadn't been in there to begin with if she hadn't had representation from predestination it never took hold there stood priests there said this man is bl's above see no representation eternal life you always was see you have eternal life there's only one form of it that's god you were his attribute he thought of you and knowed you before the foundation of the world in his mind see she looked around what a sinful shape she was in but see he couldn't he couldn't get that priest because the priest was an educated scholar a theologian in the word but no representation in heaven see wasn't in god's thinking at all but this woman was oh friends this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to us this revelation amen that quickened inside of us to where we know that we have the substance that evidence is the greatest thing that ever happened to us because we are so secure nothing can happen we can be no more lost and god can be lost [Applause] it doesn't make us insecure i mean this revelation should bring security and the more amen the the deeper the revelation the more that unlocks it should bring a greater security all the time a greater security amen a foundation that we can stand on that all things are well this isn't this a future home brother branham is a little bit hard to follow because he's drawing on a diagram on a board i wish i had the diagram said i'd like to draw that for you just a moment now we want to get this real clear so now watch close now on this teaching now this here here is god god which is the eternal there is no one but him but in god he had attributes now this here represents the word the word of god which was made flesh and dwelt among us in the person of jesus now this here fellow here we're going to make him like this now this is called the woman at the well this is the priest pharisee and where you see this open blackboard means grace and salvation now in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and one among us the three stages it was attribute first was in god that he thought of himself as being human and that transmitted him down to be jesus and now if you'll ever be there you was with him then for there's only one form of eternal life and that's god and you had to be a part of god at the beginning not what you just chose down here he chose you all the father has given me will come now look at this priest here we find this his bottom part here back life back behind him his predestination back here is sinful here is hell down here now this little part in here that looks like the blackboard that represents his purity so brother branham said his back part his back life his predestination is sinful he didn't come from the thoughts of god but he said this outer part of him this is his purity catch this this is wonderful this represents his purity he was a priest he was an honorable man that represented this he was also had to be a good man or he couldn't be a priest but see how he's got it was intellectual learning now this little woman her first life up here she was a prostitute she was all marred up but way down in here her here was just a little bit of understanding i know when messiah comes see see that was there notice when jesus come and manifested the word because the word discerned the thoughts that was in the heart as hebrews 4 12 says that he would the word was a discerner of the thoughts of the heart and he came a son of man the prophet what happened the priest with only intellectual learning said it's a devil because that's what his denomination called it what did it do he had no representation so it blacked him out but this little woman had nothing to present she was filthy and dirty as could be but notice way down in her she's got representations and then she was looking for this to be made flesh and when he said go get your husband and come here said sir i have none said you have said the truth because you've got five and the one you have now is not yours you've had five that makes six you have she said sir not you're not beelzebub i perceive that you are a prophet now we know that messiah which is called christ will come and when he does he'll do this he said i am he no more doubt you didn't have to explain it she saw it she believed it away she went why what did it do to her it redeemed her she was redeemed by what faith in the present word amen what declared abel righteous faith in the present word what declared abraham righteous faith in the present word what declared noah righteous faith in the present word do you understand where does it come from faith in the present word we'll redeem back that seed he says the priest down deep had no representation but on the surface he had purity that he had gotten through intellectual learning he lived a holy life but in the back life or down in the soul was no representation over here the outward part of this woman was prostitute dirty and filthy but down inside she had representation by predestination so when the present-day truth flashed before both of them this one said it's beelzebub he was blacked out she said it's the truth she was redeemed what redeemed her faith in the present truth praise be to god friends do you realize how god is separating today he's separating by the revelation of the word amen he's bringing the revelation amen he's not done he's continually unveiling himself amen and those that can catch the revelation were in his mind before there's a mystical channel that's still open friends it's not done it didn't stop in 1965 cut the mystical channel to the unsafe and just believe that amen he's telling us what the prophet told us he's showing us what was already preached it's been preached we're not looking for a new preacher to come and bring us the message we've got the message now what is he doing he's taking amen by a mystical channel amen he's letting stuff drop down and roll down from the unseen world through a mystical channel and drop into our hearts and quicken and we say i see it i read it 10 times i've read it 100 times i've heard the tape dozens of times but when something tumbles down from the unseen world through the mystical channel and drops into the soul you say i see it [Applause] didn't you see it when you read it no i read it well what made you see it i read it and then i seen it but i thought you already read it yeah but i read it and didn't see it this time i read it and i saw it [Applause] what changed not your ability to read there was a mystical connection a mystical channel amen god didn't cut that tie when the prophet left amen they're still amen there's still the word to be fleshed out and the bride is going up word by word revelation by revelation there's still a mystical channel to the unseen world why because you've got representation there and you've got representation here and if you have representation there and representation here there's a channel how do you get the channel representation here and representation there hey amen amen has has anything ever rolled down from the unseen world and lodged into your soul and you said i see it you know what that means that means you've got representation there and here and you've got representation there and here what's going to harm you what's going to happen amen nothing what we need to do is keep the channel clear keep our mind out of it forget reasoning amen and rely on this channel to bring a spiritual revelation of the word and quit trying to figure things out and quit trying to take old thinking amen but say god you there's a representation here and there you can reveal this to me to the individual [Music] you realize revelation is to the individual [Music] it's not like we all come to church and the preacher's got the channel now the preacher should have a channel if he doesn't let's go find another preacher his channel won't do you any good his representation his revelation won't do you any good you have to have your own mystical channel that's open and unplugged by human reason what's holding back the church fear where does fear come from reasoning what's the greatest thing holding back the church today fear but if i have representation there and here what have i got to be afraid of fred i won't make it you already made it afraid i'll be deceived with a mystical channel open between you and god you realize let the fear go and say god i'm not relying on my understanding and i'm not relying on the understanding of another man but i believe i've got representation there and here and there's a channel open lord let some more roll out of the unseen world and drop into my soul so i can see it that i can see it then i can have what the little woman at the well had she wasn't relying on anybody else's story she saw it herself it wasn't these eyes it was these eyes down here what did it do it redeemed her we're in the same quote he said no more i'll read this part again no more doubt you didn't have to explain it she saw it she believed it the way she went why why did it what what did it do to her it redeemed her now watch he came to be a redeemer is that right what does redeem mean bring back why didn't he get the priest he never was up there he had no representation oh friend i'm so excited right now amen why because if you've got the same revelation the little woman at the well god that means you were there with that little woman at the well before the foundation of the world she was my sister in the mind of god theirs with the attributes we were together the thoughts of god are literally they're real they're not like our thoughts brother benham said we were there amen with with fellowship before in the mind of god amen i can get the same kind of revelation she got because i come from where she came from and guess what i can get the same kind of revelation that william branham got because i come from the same place that revelation wasn't just for a prophet that revelation was for the bride every member of the bride can receive spiritual revelation from god every member of the bride must receive spiritual revelation from god it's going to be what you believe not what jeremiah's or or what some of them say jeremiah and some say alive who cares what some of them say my church teaches who cares what your church teaches my pastor says who cares what your pastor says you know what i mean i'm not saying you shouldn't care what your pastor says but it's got to be your own personal revelation of jesus christ in your day you got to know the day you live in you got to know who you are you got to know who he is amen you got to have the message by revelation yourself i hate i hate when you talk to somebody says well we believe who's we who's the weed that's gonna answer for you we believe that just makes you feel more comfortable what that really means is i'm not really sure but i'm going with the flow i'm not real certain but the common thinking around me is this and so i'll just repeat what we think what we think our church teaches my pastor says to me that's red flags somebody doesn't have a revelation this is the way i see it god showed me amen amen it's good if we believe the same thing hopefully we do but it's got to be the individual what does redeem me bring back why didn't he get the priest you realize he was there to get his subjects what's he doing here now get his subjects he was there to get a subject he had needs to go by samaria why because there was an eternal predestinated seed there that needed some light had representation here and there but the channel had to be opened it needs to go by samaria she had come from there so she could receive the word she could be redeemed and when she got the revelation and saw it she was redeemed when you got the revelation and saw it you were redeemed a redeemed son of god why couldn't he get the priest why couldn't he get the priest he was never up there see he had no representation he come to redeem that which had fallen in the fall this got messed up with this with that girl but god had her in his thinking before the foundation of the world and he come to cleanse her she had eternal life see where the priest what did it do to him it sent him right back to his destination he had nothing to begin only intellectual learning now listen friend if the only thing you've got is just intellectual learning you get something different from that and you'll never be able to get it unless you got representation that's the reason i believe you come from the east and west north and south the word living made manifest this priest on the outside had purity by intellectual learning deep inside nothing this girl had impurity on the outside but inside she had representation she could be redeemed the priest couldn't be redeemed jesus come along and manifest the word for that day she connected to it and believed it she was redeemed he came to cleanse her he didn't care i mean i don't want to say it this way he wasn't withdrawn because of her sinful condition he didn't hesitate because her filthiness neither was he drawn to the priest because of his morality he was looking for the seed and the only way to find the seed was to present the word and the seed would believe the word and when she believed that she was redeemed when he rejected it he was blacked out it's that simple and that still goes on today every day all around us the same thing is happening amen because he is here in the form of his bride he is displaying the word for this day amen and the word for this day is separating [Music] there are some with predestination brother brahma says in the masterpiece so we realize that we're here in a negative form and as long as there's a negative there has to be a positive oh i get so excited when i think about this this life is just a negative there's got to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive c because it's because of the positive that makes the negative so which came first the positive or the negative there had to be a positive to make the negative so if i'm here in negative form then there's a positive form somewhere else i have representation it's the positive that makes a negative like you had a negative picture of some object there has to be an object somewhere or to or to strike the light to strike that lens or there wouldn't be any negative you get what brother bran was trying to tell us don't get caught up in photography that's not the point he's trying to explain you he's not trying to teach us photography i mean some of these kids don't even know what a negative is we were looking through a book at my grandma's house the other day and one of my kids pulled out a negative said what's this this is weird they hold up to the light i tried to explain it but it didn't make any sense so we'll do a class on what a negative is sorry guys you guys just hang on there's before you can ever make a negative there has to be an object somewhere to make the negative brother do you see what brother bram's trying to teach us you're completely secure you were secure before you ever got here before your mom and dad ever got married before you ever gleam in their eye you were completely secure you're not going to be lost he's not going to lose himself you're not going to be a cast away you're not going to be falling away you're not going to be you're not going to miss the rapture you realize what he's trying to get us if you're here in a negative form and you know that to be true the negative come there had to be an object somewhere for the lens to strike to create the negatives he's using different ways to try to tell us the same way it's the same thing like you had a negative picture of some object there had to be an object somewhere to strike the light to strike that lens or there would be any negative so when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we're in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's reflecting something here on earth and we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere if that isn't i'm the worst deceived man in the world i've spent my life in vain but i know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's there that's why we're here why are you here in a negative form because there's a positive form over there that you come from you're the negative reflection of that it's already there amen if if this tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting eternal in the heavens you know it's not like god is gonna make an eternal celestial body for you and all of a sudden he's like this ain't working out this ain't working out he just he's not exactly hitting like i thought he would hit i must have made some mistakes hey scrap that destroy it tear it down burn it up throw it into it come on it ain't going to happen if you're hearing the negative oh praise god everything's just fine and what's he doing with the negative brother man tells in another place i know the quote but he's taking the negative into the dark room this is the dark room this earth is the dark room and he's brought us into the dark room for development because he's wanting to take us from negative back to the positive image again what is happening in your life development what are the trials development what are what is what is going on development what is every service about development what is every trial about development what's he doing he's trying to get us back into that image amen that we came from [Applause] listen to this he tells it this way birth pains 1965. a little dew drop i don't know the formula of it but maybe there's a science here see don't pay attention to the photography don't pay attention to the science get the lesson what's he trying to say about me there may be a science here i'm just going to say away i think you don't even care if the science is right the way i think it might be some kind of congested group of atmosphere come together in a dark night and it falls to the earth what's he talking about you congested bit of atmosphere and a dark night fallen to the earth was it done it's changed state it was one way and now it's come to the earth in another form do you get that can we follow what the prophet's teaching us come together in a dark night and it falls to the earth and when it does it's born in the night he's talking about us he doesn't care about dew this isn't a science lesson he's talking about us when it does it's born in the night but in the morning it's laying there cold and shivering on a little blade of grass or hanging on your clothes line but just let the sun shine out once did you notice how happy it gets it just glistens and quivers why it knows that it's that sunlight it's going to draw it back to where it was at the beginning and so is every man or woman that's born of the spirit of god there's something about it when the light spreads over us that we're happy because we know we're going back to where we come from from the bosom of god can sparkle with joy when the sun hits it of course knowing it's going to where it came from that's why at the rising of the sun amen at the preaching of the word when the seals were open it was the rising of the sun it was shalom it was good morning and what happened the sun came out amen the sun came up on a new day in all the little atmosphere that had been congealed down in the dark and born in the night into darkness you were born in darkness but when the light of the word came out to shine all of a sudden the dewdrop just starts to quiver and get excited hey this is our life this is when you come in contact with the word this is when the preaching comes forth and the power of revelation you just sit there and quiver under why you know it's this preaching you know it's this revelation that's taking me back to where i come from through the bosom of the father i just tremble and glisten and get excited and begin to dance around just like a little dew drop because i know it's this revelation it's this light that's shining in this hour that is changing me back to what i was in the beginning it's literally changing me amen brother branham said we're already raptured up he said you used to smoke you used to drink you're already in the resurrection because the life is changing this to match the word [Applause] and that light begins to shine that's why you say amen that's why you shout that's why you can't wait to get to church because you know it's this light amen when you play a tape and you begin to say amen that's the truth what's happening that is that that little bit of atmosphere it's the same thing in another form [Applause] that's the life down on the inside not the flesh the life on the inside it's not something different it went from visible invisible to visible back to invisible. see the journey come down and born in a dark night that little bit of atmosphere from the unseen world you couldn't see it before but now you see it but i want to say shalom little bride it is the rising of the sun and that word that's been risen in this day that's shining brighter than it's ever shine that's the thing that gets us trembling and excited and begin to dance around because we know we can feel it happening inside of us amen all of a sudden the molecules are getting excited things are beginning to dance about spiritually inside of us because we know we're going back to where we came from and it's the power of this light that is taking us back that's why the message came that's what we're here to do to display that we have representation there is no fear faith is a revelation but a revelation is only for a special group of people the woman at the well she could get it rebecca at the well she got it what bible did she read you see what i'm saying the woman who touched the hem of his garment she got it what scripture did she read see she had a channel open she could catch a revelation she thought within herself if i could touch the hymn of his guardian i could be made every bit whole god wants to lead us by revelation god wants to direct us friends god doesn't want your mind he wants your soul god doesn't want to lead us by our minds he wants to direct us by that attribute on the inside he wants us to get comfortable living in a world of revelation where all of a sudden something from the unseen world tumbles rolls down through a mystical channel that just explained my life that quote rolled down through a mystical channel and dropped in my soul and i said i see it brother graham said above all pray for revelation pray for revelation say god above everything else give me revelation lord i believe i've got representation in heaven i've experienced too much not to believe it i believe by faith the substance that you gave me for things hoped for the evidence that things not seen i believe i have it i've got the channel open now god help me to die out to reason and die out to my own ideas die out to old ways of thinking let me lay that down and let me focus on this open channel to receive from the unseen through a mystical channel revelation directly from you then when next time i read my bible i'll be reading along about i see it what happened it wasn't cause you got bifocals something happened that's the way he wants us to live let fear fade away let anxiety pass off the scene let the revelation of the word made manifest in this hour let it bring security to your bride say all things are well is everything well everything's well but you look like you're going through a rough time perfect all as well i'm fine it looks like things are falling apart all around you it's okay nothing's falling apart in here there's no damage between the channel everything's all right amen god bless you saints let's stand musicians if you can come brother jim you can come let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you for this word of life god as you constantly are trying lord to keep your bride's eyes open lord those spiritual eyes of understanding that they continue to be enlightened lord that we would not be caught up in laodicea that we would not be caught up in the natural things all around us what the carnal mind can see and what the carnal mind can understand but we ask lord that you would keep us tuned in to your frequency lord god i pray right now lord that you would take each one of us and tune our spiritual dials in you've given us a transmitter you've given us something to receive the transmission lord we've got the crystal on the inside that can pick it up like the prophet said lord i pray that you just dial the dial in dial it away from reasoning dial it away from habit dial it away from tradition dial it away from education lord and dial it right in so that that channel that's that you you've linked between us in the unseen world that it's it's in tune lord that it's in the right frequency that we're in the right channel that we can continually get revelation from you and we can live a life not of reasoning and not of mental understanding but we can live a life of revelation lead your bride by revelation you're going to take her out of here by revelation lord we need to learn to live by revelation if we're going to take our flight by revelation help us o god open our eyes that we might see lord open our spiritual understanding that we might perceive all that you're trying to do in this day we love you god forgive us lord for plugging the channel with things of the world forgive us lord for chasing worldly desires for chasing distractions and things of the world but lord let us lay those things aside and focus lord on you let us stay in your word and stay in fellowship and stay in harmony lord with the unseen world that we can get the signals lord that we can download the messages from the unseen world and we can stay tied into your present revelation god we love you we thank you for the things that you're teaching us lord i feel this morning like that little dew drop that's just quivering lord i know that this sunlight that i feel now lord that's given me such a joy is going to take me all the way back to where i came from i know it lord i know this is a temporary journey here to manifest your glory here to live and flesh out your word but i know that this joy that i feel i know that this warmth from this light is going to take me back home lord god i'm so happy i pray god that you give us a greater revelation minute by minute hour by hour lord that we might live in this revelation take care of your people lord as we part from here let these things not fade away from us lord but let them drop into our heart let us meditate on them day and night let us give let us give more more diligence lord to the things that we've heard we love your god and we ask for your blessing to be upon us as we part now in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless your saints we love you with the love of the lord can we sing winds of faith i just want to say i love this song but there literally are two roads there are literally two roads we can work walk every day and god has never taken away free choice and all of us know what it's like to take the one by side and we know what that leads to don't we we've had problem after problem after problem by taking that wrong road but when we take the way of faith it's never led us astray it's never deceived us it's never done us wrong and i say this morning there's still two roads there's cain's way and there's abel's way i say let's take abel's way there's the priest way and there's the woman at the well let's take the woman at the whale's way and when there's the way of reasoning or is there's the way that little rebecca at the well that day she caught something that wasn't spoken she caught something that wasn't written but she caught a message from heaven because she had a channel open i said god i want that kind of channel open that every day i can catch a message from you that is some say i can have water i'll water the camels too she may not even understood what was happening amen but eliezer knew gone through that's the way i want to live friends every day of my life and i'm i want to wake up every morning and say god turn me in dial me back let me stay tuned in let's sing this as you dismissed one by [Music] what faith believe is you can fly in a higher place what you need to cry watch your mountain [Music] is [Music] he does not struggle he does not strive for the power is it's my grace you may take one by one by the word of god [Laughter] [Music] place watch the word of god is [Music]
