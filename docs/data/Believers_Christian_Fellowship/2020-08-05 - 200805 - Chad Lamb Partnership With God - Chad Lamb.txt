========================================

you didn't have to open my eyes [Music] oh then i heard recognizing your day o serpent seed and the breach and the message of grace and i just want to thank you lord for letting me hear your word what have i done to deserve such glory revealed in me thanks for that special night oh when i saw the glorious not even in my wildest dreams did i think i'd see such things as the coming of the lord the rapture mystery i have heard but now i see oh god in simplicity the spoken word is the original seed and lord i thank thee let you stand and yes i thank you lord for letting me hear your word what have i done to deserve such glory revealed when i saw your glorious life came face to face is that your prayer this evening i lift it up [Music] this lord of my soul [Music] [Music] make me [Music] i lift [Music] my soul bread of heaven feed me till i'm over fill it up amen praise the lord so what you want is your cup filled today amen well praise the lord we all want the same thing let's take our bibles while we're standing let's go straight into the word and let's look at first corinthians chapter three first corinthians chapter three i enjoyed hearing the update about sister marsha and continue to keep her prayers she's got a lot of recovering to do but god has been merciful to our sister he shined his grace and his love upon her and i know that god will bring her through just pray to go strengthen her and bless the family as they take care of her i know she's happy to get home i was able to talk to her for a little bit yesterday and she was cheerful on the phone and in good spirits and i thought after all that she's been through to be in good spirits and cheerful on the phone is amazing so i was encouraged by the call so just keep remembering her in prayer also this weekend saturday there'll be a minister's meeting in brighton michigan hosted by brother dan ratliff and he's invited us up so i'm going to be up there so be praying for that that god will just bless us in our fellowship there with the brothers and brother kyle's going to be ministering for us on sunday he's going to help me out with that so be praying for brother kyle as well amen let's look at first corinthians chapter 3 verse 5. who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom he believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted apollos water but god gave the increase so that neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together with god this is interesting term and this is what i want to hone in on they're not laborers together for god they're laborers together with god that means they're in partnership with god laboring together for the church with god for we are laborers together with god you're god's husbandry you're god's field you're god's building god's temple so the work that god is doing working in his field and working in this building apollos and paul were laborers together with god in that field and in that building amen let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you for your word that you've given to us lord we ask now in the name of jesus christ that you would come by the power of your spirit and take a gift lord that's laying in a clay vessel that you would take it in your hands and begin to minister lord the eternal word of life to us give us the thing that we have need of for this hour lord for this stage in our journey give us the instructions lord the leadership the guidance the correction that we need right now lord that we can be pleasing to you that we can be with your program walking in harmony with your program now you can be blessed lord and we desire to be a laborer with you as well in your field in your vineyard and in your building god use us for that as a tool in your hand we pray in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated i want to take for a subject tonight if i can partnership with god and brother rem says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now all the great revelation now now to restore back his kinship to bring back now he had to let them get lost you understand he had to let them sin put them on free moral he he could not make them sin and remain god and then punish them for something he had made them do but when he put man on partnership with him then let men act as a free moral agency the same thing he's got you on today see you act any way you want to you are your free moral agent so therefore if we put the first like that he has to put the second like that he has to put everyone like that or he acted wrong in the first place see but everybody is on the same basis so brother branham is teaching us very clearly here that according to god's will and god's great plan when he knew that there would be a fall amen because he had a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world and if he had already in his mind a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world then he knew there would be a need for a sacrificial lamb and if he knew there would be a need then he knew there would be a fall and the fall worked together in god's great plan amen according to his great purpose that he had in his mind it all worked together but god to remain righteous and the main god he could not force man to sin amen so when god put man on partnership with him he put him on the basis of free moral agency and this is amazing what what what is the basis of our partnership with god the basis of our partnership is free moral agency we can act any way we want there's no forcing and i wrote down this phrase here if you'll just lock this in your mind if if god could not force man to sin then he cannot force them to act in righteousness see if you're going to have one you have to have the other if god could not force man into have fallen to sin then god cannot force man into righteousness amen man is on partnership with god and in that partnership with god man is on free moral agency to make his choice amen and god has partnered himself with man but given the man the power of free choice and so it's much more powerful i think than what we realize um there's a couple quotes here i want to read i want to take just a little deviation and you'll find out why in just a moment but brother bam says in the message adoption so now the book of ephesians as i just sang to my opinion is one of the greatest books of the new testament now when a prophet says something like that immediately radars go off and probably said one of the greatest books in the new testament did not want to be familiar with that book so to my opinion the book of ephesians in my opinion is one of the greatest books of the new testament it leaves us on where calvinism runs out on one limb and armenianism runs out on the other limb but the book of ephesians draws it together and positionally places the church so brother i'm saying calvinism goes out on one limb armenianism goes on on the other but the book of ephesians draws it back together amen where it's correct because calvinism if you look at extreme calvinism uh it is it is everything is purposed and pre-planned by god and really man has no choice in the matter he's just going along with the program and you don't have to worry about anything you don't have to do anything everything's fine god worked it out armenianism is and you know that must that's a crude definition so if there's a theologian in the house you'd be like oh by the chad but that's just in my own words armenianism is on the other hand what brother ben calls legalism armenianism is that you you by your conduct by your actions by your choice by your effort amen you obtain unto yourself salvation by your choice by your will by by exercising your will you you can obtain for yourself salvation and brother brahman says they they they're both wrong but they're not both completely wrong he says that here in a minute they're both wrong but ephesians draws the two ideas together so in order to understand god and understand the word you've got to take those two ideas and draw them together he says in questions and answers from 59 i can't make calvinism just believe on the lord and you get eternal security and armenianism that if i just touch not handle not taste not i'd like to do it but but i can't do it armenianism is too far away from calvinism and they both are wrong i've got to see where they both got scriptures but it's got to hit the target now if god said one thing in the bible it's got to hit the target it's got to make every ring in that bible come right straight down to the bull's-eye it's got to do it because it's god's word and he's infinite and he can't change then in the patmos vision from 1960 he says and we use the word sometime it's predestination but it's a sure hanger in this church age that we live in it was certainly a great thing used in the days of the martyrs because they certainly believed it but it's got away from it now to the legalist idea the legalist teaching in the church which was a good thing because all of it had gone calvinistic in england until they didn't even have revivals anymore and john wesley came along preaching the armenian doctrine which balanced it up god will always balance it up so he'd gotten one side too far amen in this extreme calvinism where everybody there's no need to do missionary work there's no need to have evangelistic campaign everything that belongs to god will come to god amen he's already decided there's nothing to do and just they've gotten so lazy they've gotten into uh when when john wesley shows up the church had gotten into a state of such depravity such sin amen and such vulgarity within the ranks of the church because of the misunderstanding of eternal security that god said he'd allow john wesley and john wesley amen come out tearing this down but to do so he went over onto one extreme and now it was all by works and all by effort and and you climb your way up the ladder and you mess up you fall down and get back on the letter and climb your way up to the ladder amen and one an extreme is just as bad as the other in extreme but brother branham was saying they both have scriptures amen in ephesians draws them together so i'd like to take a look at several scriptures in ephesians if we can turn there together and just bear with me like in a bible study so we're in a bible study so i say that so you have the right expectation it means we're going to read a lot of scriptures together in a bible study on this wednesday night but i want to see what brother branham's talking about because this uh this for me uh lays a foundation for what i've been thinking on and meditating on about this partnership with god in ephesians chapter 1 verse 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god so right out of the shoot paul starts off paul is an apostle not by anything that he has done paul is an apostle by the will of god paul and the apostle jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you in peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love now you see right out of the shoot right in the beginning of ephesians paul the apostle paul was laying down amen foundational understanding that that he was apostle by the will of god not by any merit any works that he had done but by god's will and now we are blessed in christ jesus because according as he has chosen us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love so god chose us in christ before the foundation of the world so that we would be holy and without blame before him in love now now these are foundational statements that he's going to build the thoughts in the book of ephesians upon this understanding verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so the same thing that made apostle paul that made paul an apostle is the same thing that's chosen us predestinated us to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the beloved who made who he made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself so so far how much have you had to do in the book of ephesians nothing you've done nothing not your idea not your thought not your will not your pleasure this these statements so far has nothing to do with you it is all based off what god wanted praise god now remember ephesians is pulling two thoughts together amen so let's keep reading verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also that you have believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory so praise god i can read ephesians and start feeling pretty good because it's all his purpose his plan his will his design his foreign nation his predestination his work his sacrifice let's go to chapter 2 verse 1. and you hath thee quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved when you were dead he loved you he chose you in christ not after you decided to do good but when when you were doing everything he says in verse 2 where and in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit thou now worketh in the children of disobedience that's how we walked that's the condition we were in when we come to this life and in verse 3 he says among whom also we all had our conversation paul includes himself there in past the uh in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others so you realize it was god's mercy by god's grace it was not our merit because we were all lumped into the same place and now no ability to come right in order to obtain god's mercy amen but it was god's grace that shed his mercy but we were yet dead in trespasses and sins verse 6 and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus who raised who who did the work what ladder did you climb to get there how much did you sweat how hard was it he raises together amen to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus then in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them so we are god's workman his craftsmanship the thing that he's making we are his whatever he's forming we're created in christ jesus unto good works so god has crafted us and made us to be a vessel of good works but those good works are what he hath ordained that we should walk in them so what we are going to do the good things that we'll accomplish are the things that were ordained before the foundation of the world that he ordained for us to do not that we conjured up in our mind and decided to do because we were good people if we do anything we do what what he leads us to do we do things by his will and by his foreknowledge chapter 3 verse 1. i'm just pulling segments out not reading the whole thing to save time but just pulling bits and pieces ephesians 3 verse 1 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which has given me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote a foreign few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit what the gentiles should be that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel wherefore i was made a minister according to the gift of grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power so paul's coming back to the same place he's saying now i've received a revelation paul didn't get anything by study and he realized paul had studied paul had studied probably more than we've ever studied coming up through the the ranks of the jewish religion coming up through the school of gamaliel he had studied but he didn't get the mystery of christ by study it was given to him by revelation as a gift and then it was given to him to us word it was given to him so that he could dispense it back to the gentiles because the mystery was that god would be known among the gentiles not because the gentiles were worthy but because god had ordained it before the foundation of the world and now he says therefore wherefore in verse 7 i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power so the apostle paul is claiming nothing but he's stating the absolute truth but he's claiming nothing he didn't do it he didn't work his way up to it he didn't figure it out amen he was just there when god called he was the vessel god chose i mean this is the thing god hid before the foundation of the world god decided to reveal it so paul got it because god paul was the one who was chosen amen to be given a dispensation to go to the gentiles it was all god's doing it wasn't paul's doing he says verse 8 unto me whom less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now to the intent that now the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith by the faith of him praise be to god paul's saying we didn't do it he did it it wasn't our figuring out it was his divine revelation and he's given it now to the gentiles not based off their merit but by his preordained plan so now we've spent the first half ephesians is in six chapters and we spent the first half of ephesians and in the first half of ephesians the apostle paul was laying out very strongly that all of this has been done by god's grace by god's will for god's purpose that we were lost amen we were children of disobedience we were we we were we were we were under the prince of the power of the air we were in darkness we all of these things he's telling us there was no merit of our own but by grace amen and then he's called us to works because we're his workmanship and paul is laying this out using himself as an example and explaining the condition to the church so that that by the time you get halfway through ephesians you're solidly convinced and sure that if you believe amen you believe because god amen before the foundation of the world gave you something to believe with that if you're a child of god it was chosen you were chosen in christ before the foundation of the world and it's god's purpose according to god's plan according to god's good pleasure by god's will and god's already done it now we're going to move into the second half of ephesians ephesians 4 verse 1. i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called now paul is making a turn and the first half he's talking about what god has done you couldn't do wasn't you it was him his will his pleasure right but now he's telling you now i'm going to tell you to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you were called with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace let's go down to verse 11. and he he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ so now he's telling us that there's an ongoing work and god has given these ministry gifts for the perfecting the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love this i say therefore and testify in the lord that you henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having an understanding dark and being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over into lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but you have not so learned christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus that you put off concerning the former conversations the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore pouring putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members of one of another be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steel no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace into the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you men do you see the turn the first half god did god chose god's merit god's grace god's love you were stuck in this condition you were in darkness you were under the prince of power air but while you were there his great love loved you and his mercy was extended because of grace you didn't do it you're his workmanship creating christ he's in the good work but she is the dream you should walk in them he's got it under control he's got a plan here in christ from before you were chosen before the foundation of the world but then after he establishes that after he establishes that principle then he comes down and he says don't do this don't do this don't do this do this do this do this don't do that do this don't do that did you read that or did i just make this out you see this is the age-old debate that goes you know you can't serve god by do's and don'ts you're serving by love and you're saved by grace not do's and don'ts and don't teach me the do's and don'ts but you realize that both go together ephesians is pulling them both together and ephesians is saying you were chosen before the foundation of the world with no merit of your own you were dead you were dead in trespassing sin and his mercy was extended to you by his grace it was what he did by his choosing by his good pleasure not by any deeds or works or merits of your own but now that you have come to the revelation of god choosing you you have come into christ amen you've been baptized in the holy ghost now do this do this do this don't do this don't do that do this let's go on ephesians chapter 5 verse 1. be therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also have loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor but fornication and all clean uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as become a saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this you know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedient be not ye therefore partakers with them for ye were sometimes darkness but now are you light and the lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are that are reproved or made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepeth and arise from the dead in christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and be not drunk with wine wearing as excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your hearts to the lord giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves into your unhusbands as unto the lord now down to verse 25 and husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so we see chapter four do do don't don't chapter five dude don't don't don't chapter six verse one children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth and your fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling and singleness of heart as unto christ not with eye service as men pleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with good will doing services to the lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall be received to the lord whether he be bond or free and you masters do the same thing unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is their respect to persons with him finally my brethren be strong in the lord in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about the truth with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints so now i hope now by the time we get to done with this that you see the the the two divisions in the book of ephesians the first three chapters and the second half chapters four five and six and and not just if we could just look at the way it's constructed if the apostle paul had flipped those two sections and you got the last three chapters first we would be an awful discouraged person but the apostle paul lays down the fundamental truth that we are chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we are god's chosen we are chosen unto adoption amen we are predestinated amen because there's no way that you can come to the obedience of the second half without the revelation of the first half the revelation of the first half amen and the security that comes from the first half and the love that is expressed in the first half is what gives us the strength amen and the ability to obey in the second half but see we become awfully tired people when we try to attain to the grace of the first half by keeping the second half and we become reprobate if we hold to the first half with ignoring the second half so this is where brother bram says calvinism went off one way armenianism legalism went off another one extreme grace and predestination amen with extreme legalism they went two different ways but ephesians pulls them back together and says yes you were chosen yes god knew you before the foundation of world yes you can no more be lost in god can be lost you're a child of god names in the book chosen in christ he died for you when you had no merit to produce anything for yourself it's all his choosing by his will according to his pleasure he revealed the mystery not in that day but in this day because this is the day he wanted to let it out and he chose paul to dispensate that that truth amen nothing anybody had anything to do with amen it gets us so secure in our position of god and so confident in in the level that he himself has lifted us out of darkness into life and set us in heavenly places in christ jesus amen and he so lifts us into that position to free us from the bondage of darkness and carnal understanding so that now we become a free people to express god through the second half of the book of ephesians then now when he says don't do that amen now me withholding myself from the things he says to abstain from amen it is not my withholding myself is not going to produce for me salvation it's not going to produce for me amen an elected place with god that is secure no matter how many times i fail in the second half of ephesians will not change the first half me with the revelation of the first half and what god has done for me and who i really am and what he's really done for me amen it unlocks my heart amen in a way that says if he did that for me if that's who i really am if i'm so secure amen and it doesn't matter amen it doesn't matter how many times i've failed or how many times i will fail it's not going to change the first three chapters of ephesians they're set in stone and if i'm not secure and then god's that good to me amen now in my heart is a desire to be all that he wants me to be and that's why the revelation of this message is the true revelation of the heart and mind of god and the conduct of the children is not it's not spoiled children that now are rich kids but we can do no wrong and god keeps pouring blessings in con no we're on partnership with god and that partnership brings a responsibility and the partnership is based on free moral agency and he did something for us that are that is beyond our free moral agency because he knows of the fallen condition that man is going to fall into and then he knew what was going to happen that why he said that's really the reason he secured his election before he put man and woman on free moral agency in the garden of eden he had already secured their election because there's something stronger than free moral agency and the thing is stronger free moral agency is the will of god but when it comes to this life he puts himself in his expression in this world he puts himself amen in partnership with man and that partnership is based on free moral agency and now god in his expression upon this earth is linked to man through free moral agency and now god god wants us to completely and fully obey the last three chapters of ephesians do you believe that that's the desire of god god wants us to completely obey every dot every mark every line every verse in the last three chapters of ephesians don't do this don't do that don't have strife don't have contention amen don't don't even speak about those things that are done of them in secret all of the things that he said god wants us to keep it amen but but god will not force us to keep it because he's partnering himself with us by free moral agency he wants us to do it but he wants us to do it as an expression of our love for him for what he and his grace has done for us so you can't say it doesn't matter what i do it matters to god what you do it very much matters to god what you do he wouldn't have spent spent half the book of ephesians for something that doesn't matter for instance if we say if we use the old phrases you know god doesn't care what i do he's just looking at my heart he's not the do's and don'ts but it's by his grace i mean you're taking two principles amen in your mirror making it either this or that amen and it's not either this or that it's this first then that [Music] first you come to the realization of what he has done for you when you had no ability to do for yourself amen and when you see the goodness and mercy and grace of god and your secure position in him he has unlocked a faith inside of us that he put there and he sent a spirit to us his spirit unto us that would give us the power and ability to keep the second half of the book of ephesians and that that is our partnership with him his partnership do you believe you're in partnership with god like the prophet said his part of the partnership was to secure our salvation do you believe that because you had no ability to do it that was the part of the partnership you couldn't do so his part was to secure our salvation and to give us his word our part of the partnership is to keep his word by what by free moral agency you can do whatever you want and doing whatever you want will not change what's already been written in that book but you're not keeping your end of the partnership you're not giving back to god what he deserves i wanted to lay that as a foundation to go into where where i'd like to go next brother branham says in 1964 the identified christ of all ages he says and then usually man gets it so twisted up and the world gets it in such a shape until he has to send some man anointed all ages has been the same he identifies himself upon the earth and man god does nothing without man the bible said so you know he always takes man because it was man he had to use put him on free moral agency knowing that he would fall in order to display his attributes as savior for there was nothing lost and therefore he chose man he could have chose stars he could have chose trees but he chose man one time standing looking upon the harvest jesus he said the harvest is ripe the laborers are few praise the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest and he was the lord of the harvest you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundance that your joys might be full see he's depending on you asking and believing that you receive what you ask for we have to catch how profound that is he's depending on you asking like god has a plan right in god's plan according to his promise to abraham he promised abraham that his seed was going to sow jordan in a strange land for 400 years but he'll bring him out with a mighty hand that's god's program that's god's plan amen but see so god has to keep his end of the bargain amen in at 400 years he has got to provide amen a deliverer to come on the scene and moses shows up on the scene and moses comes on the scene as the deliverer amen and when he begins to try to deliver them amen they reject moses ministry and moses runs out into the wilderness why free moral agency they didn't have to accept him and moses could run and we know all things worked together for good and all things worked to his plan but god showed up at the right time 400 years he showed up to keep his end of the deal but the people he came to rejected the ministry that came and we know it's because the ministry wasn't in the shape it needed to be yet but still they had to reject it so that moses would run away to the wilderness so that god could beat all of egypt out of moses and get moses ready to be the right kind of deliverer amen but then when god was timed now for god to come down and complete his word because god will keep his word he comes to moses and said i have heard the cry of my people i have heard the cry of my people and i have come down what brought him down what moved him into action what happened 40 years later the people who had rejected the ministry are now crying for deliverance and god needed them to cry so that he could put the wheels in motion to bring about his word because god is on partnership with man they read he sent the ministry they rejected the ministry now they have to cry to god to get it back and you know he says i've come down i've come to deliver them and now he looks at moses and says now i'm sending you you go because god always works through man and moses amen has to a free will go amen god's not forcing him to go amen but he's he's moses is trying to weasel his way out of it because god has finally got him to where he can use him in humility and brokenness amen and desperation with no confidence in himself and he finally got him exactly where he wanted him but he got him in such a state where moses was trying to talk god out of it no sin this one said that when they won't hear me and god says no it's you because god can't choose another it's got to be moses but moses has to do it of his own free choice let's read a couple more quotes 1963 go awake jesus god does nothing without human agency you know that he has to use someone but remember he can't force he can't violate free moral agency in this life on this earth he cannot violate three more ladies he cannot force but he has to use a man somebody's got to surrender somebody's got to be willing somebody's got to obey his voice 1959 my new ministry says now you say well if he knows it then why are you preaching if he knows who's going to be saved who's not why are you preaching he said that's part of god's program preaching is his program when he looked upon the apostle he looked upon the harvest said the harvest is ripe and the laborers are few pray the lord of the harvest that he will send laborers into the harvest how many remember that well why would they have to pray to the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest if the lord of the harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why god has so arranged it that is now listen to this god has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and i you got that this is partnership with god god is so erased that his program cannot move without you and i and as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we are paralyzing his program my goodness when he when brother branham said partner he partnered with man he chose man amen that was a profound statement friends and then this statement is i mean it blow me away statement amen if god so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and i and as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we are paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the holy ghost then we are in god's will doing his program why because that's what god wants that's the partnership he's he ephesians one through three god kept his end of the deal ephesians four through six he's asking us to do ours galatians one let's turn there together galatians chapter one galatians 1 15. but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me we've been through this many times not to me but when he chose to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went to arabia and returned again to damascus now now realize when god needed somebody to preach the unsearchable riches of christ and to the gentiles he didn't send out for resumes he already in his mind had that worked out amen and that's what paul is saying god who separated me from my mother's whom god you know god was attentive to paul's birth god knew when he would be born he knew who his mom and dad would be he knew what characteristics would be laying in there he was attentive unto his birth amen because he was a chosen vessel unto the lord that's what he said when he when he went to ananias when he told ananias to go speak to saul he says i'm going to tell him that he's a chosen vessel unto me so paul says when he separated from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me so there was a purpose amen from before the time he separated from his mother's womb he was going to call him amen because he wanted to reveal his son in him but the apostle paul had to surrender he had to surrender and he had to obey so that that work could be accomplished let's turn to acts chapter 13. acts chapter 13 verse 46 when paul and barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hat the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should be for salvation into the ends of the earth so now there is an old testament prophecy laying in isaiah and now he's speaking this prophecy and paul is saying that prophecy all the way back there was about me right so paul is a chosen vessel paul is chosen to be the fulfillment of the light to the gentiles from mosaic isaiah i believe isaiah 49 or something like that and so he's predestinated he's ordained he's chosen he's called by a pillar of fire he's separated from his mother's room he's called by his grace he knows his position and he knows his purpose and it's important that we know this about paul because of a scripture we're going to get to in a minute so hold on to that and we're going to get to something here in a few minutes he says now he says in the christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now we come back here and to visit the climate in this place i certainly don't like it because it just breaks me down brother ben's talking here it just breaks me down as soon as i get here and i can cross the tops of the knobs up there and can come down in the valley and i'm here about 10 minutes and i got hives get sick weather swimmy headed everything looks spooky dark i just have to get out of it see and the other day i was talking to the wife but what brings me here first what brings me here is your people see this church i tell you of all the places i've ever went in my life this is my favorite place to preach the gospel it looks like that we can make a tape from here that's ten times better than anywhere else and see that's the reason i say where god is doing something stay right with that but think where the great thing is that was the great thing is that was me failing to go out the first time when he called me and therefore he makes it kind of rough on me when i come in obedience is better than sacrifice now looking at looking at the prophet's life now brother branham was chosen before the foundation of the world ordained to be a prophet god separated him from his mother's womb god called him by his grace god knew he would be here god knew the work he would have him to do it was preordained but yet in all the that was preordained and what god wanted to do when brother branham was called to go out to the pentecostal first time he listened to his mother-in-law and he refused and in his refusing comes a punishment he loses his wife and he loses his daughter and years later years and years and years later he's still suffering and whenever he comes back into jeffersonville amen all of a sudden he gets is swimmy-headed he gets feeling sick amen and he says because i didn't go out when he called it he makes it kind of rough on me remember it doesn't matter how much you're called it doesn't matter what your position is in the body if you disobey the lord you've got a punishment coming it doesn't matter how secure your eternity is it doesn't matter that you're bride of jesus christ amen you're bride of jesus christ that's not going to change brother bennett's position didn't change his eternal destination didn't change amen nothing changed in the first half of ephesians for him but because when he refused to obey the lord god would take a rod of chastisement and strike it upon the back of that son because he needed a son that would obey and we know all things work together all things he makes even brother memphis said he makes even our mistakes work together for his glory and even this mistake of the prophet amen it worked together for god's glory it's part of the program but don't don't be mistaken we cannot because we're we're told all the things we're told in ephesians one through three think that we can ignore ephesians four through 6 and everything god's just going to turn a blind eye to it and nothing's going to happen no we are going to suffer for disobedience because we are his children and we are our own free moral agency and we are in partnership with god and because god can do nothing without us god is going to allow the rod to come down hard because he cannot have us going that way he has got to correct it because he's got to have us in obedience to fulfill his plan so so there's no there's none of this elitism special privileges special position now i'll say it this way it doesn't matter if you get whacked on the tail for your disobedience every day you're still not changing the election right you're still not changing election it doesn't matter how how big the failures is how many times you fall we're not changing the first half of ephesians that's our security that's eternal security but eternal security can never bring an attitude of complacency disobedience or rebellion but the true revelation of eternal security brings a loving heart back to god that obeys him out of love and free moral agency we'll fail we'll make mistakes and he'll make those mistakes work back into his glory but but praise god amen the the revelation should free us to be his children and recognize we're his children and love him back and obey and whenever we don't rest assured you have a heavenly father amen who will not let his program get paralyzed too long brother banham said because moses had the problems he had god gave him a hot-tempered wife to help mold his character to bring correction to him why because god had to have moses and god's got to have you and i he's got to have us and we've got to get in step with his program by free moral agency he's not going to force if he didn't force us to fall he's not going to force us into righteousness he wants us to make that choice but as a good father amen he'll allow us to make wrong choices and suffer the consequences of the wrong choices amen so that we begin to learn we begin to learn that obedience is better than sacrifice see when we live on this life when we live this life we're living out this life it's almost like we're stuck between two worlds almost like we're stuck between two positions in two worlds i mean it's not really that way but in our thinking sometimes we can think that way because in one way i'm i i am a king and priest to god we're a spiritual kingdom i my position is secure i'm seated in heavenly places in christ jesus amen i am secure i have an inheritance in heaven i i'm part of the royal family and here i'm suffering in the flesh i'm suffering and i'm and i'm troubled on every side and i'm afflicted in many ways and things are not working out right and it it in this life amen it doesn't look like i'm a king and a priest oh but that's god's program god's program is to get us to act like the slave that brother benham talked about when he talked about the slave buyer comes by and he notices a slave that's different than all the other slaves they're all working in the field they're all toiling the same kind of labor they're all afflicted in the same kind of afflictions but there's one that stands out in the crowd because he doesn't he doesn't work he doesn't mope he doesn't pout he's not dragging his feet but he's really laboring he's holding his chest up he's walking proud and he's diligent about his work amen and you don't have to don't have to whip him to make him work that's what brother branham's saying and in the the slave buyers want to know why he wants to buy him and he says he's not for sale and he says well you know this what special treatment does this slave get that makes him act the way he acts nothing he just gets eats in the galley with the rest and sleeps in the bunk house with the rest of him he works all the same jobs he's not a boss there's nothing different between him and anybody else in this bondage and there's nothing different between you and i'm talking in the flesh i'm talking purely carnal there's nothing different between you and anybody else in this bondage he says well what makes him that way and the owner says i i wondered myself but i found out that over in a foreign land his father is the king of the tribe and though he's away from home and in bondage he conducts himself as the son of a king that's what he's looking for amen you can't we're just in as much of a mess as every other human beings in a mess just as much afflicted by heat and storm and hail i mean what special protection do you have against the heat wave right we get afflicted with the same things the world gets afflicted why but we should act different and respond to it different than anybody else in the world responds to it our conduct should be different because he's on partnership with us let's turn quickly to joshua i want to pick up a little bit out of joshua chapter 1. brother branham says that joshua is the ephesians of the old testament he says some interesting things i'm not going to get into much of that i'm just going to touch into it we may get into more later but he says joshua's ephesians the placing of the church and joshua parallels ephesians he preached a message like that one time and like i said we won't get into much depth in that but i want to touch on him and joshua we know joshua is the one that god has chosen to lead them into the promised land moses died on outside across the river and now joshua's going to lead them over to possess the land and joshua chapter 1 verse 1 now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spoke unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give them even to the children of israel every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses pay close attention to what he says in verse 3 every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses now god told moses that he had given all the land from this border to this border and from this border to this border it's all yours i'm giving it to you but now he makes a stipulation all the land that you put your foot on i've given to you now god is going to be in partnership with man god said i give the land to you it's a good land that flows with milk and honey i will drive out the inhabitants i will give this land to you but then when it comes time to cross over he puts himself in partnership with the children of israel and he says wherever you put your human foot i'll give you that space which means if you come against an army with chariots and horses lined on the hills god has promised you that land that's your land it's got your name on it he's given it to you but he's in partnership with you for you to get possession of that land you've got to put your foot on that land which means you've got to fight that enemy this is partnership with god amen amen this is free moral agency they can turn and run they can hide they can sign a peace treaty amen but if they're going to get full possession of the land they've got to put their foot on that place where that philistine is they got to put their foot on that place where that hit tight is which means there's going to be a battle which means there's going to be a fight which means they're going to labor which means they're going to work that means they're going to give forth effort that means they're going to they're going to risk their lives amen they're going to they're going to give everything and this is the way it is with the word of god the promises are ours brothers and sisters amen they're ours for the taking but they're not ours delay in a lazy boy and sit back and say well if god ever wants me to have it he'll give it to me he says you resist the devil and he'll flee god didn't say if i resist the devil he already resisted the devil when he was in jesus christ now it's our turn to resist the devil he's in partnership with us he wants to keep his word he wants to keep his promises he wants to show up and show himself mighty on your behalf but there's a place that you've got to be willing to extend yourself and get your foot out there and put yourself in danger and put yourself in exposure amen and put yourself by the word by obedience and faith in the word there's we have to move out to the challenge of the day and if we'll move out into the challenge of the day we've got all the promises of abraham that will heap on us amen but not sitting back in the house not staying in safety why because he's on partnership with us you move he'll move he's already moved it's already in his word he's already given the promise listen ephesians parallels joshua they're coming in to get their placing they're coming in to get full possession of all that their inheritance has promised with us and the church is moving in the full possession of our inheritance but in order to move into full possession there's battles to be fought there's victories to be won those mountains to be climbed there's rivers to be crossed we're no different friends there's battles to be fought there's mountains to climb amen there's valleys of the shadow of the darkness to go through amen but if we'll go he'll promise he'll make a way if we'll step out in faith and resist the devil the devil will flee we have the promises we just have to be in action we have to have the faith to move let's go to joshua 13. i want to read several scriptures here because this is very interesting to me joshua 13. he makes this statement he says verse 6 joshua 13-6 all the inhabitants of the hill country of lebanon unto mistress maim and all the sidonians and them will i drive out before the children of israel only divide thou by lot into the israelites for an inheritance as i have commanded thee jesus said i'll drive them out he told moses i'll drive them out he told moses i've given you the land but let's go back and look at deuteronomy 7. i'm going to read two more scriptures while we're right here deuteronomy 7 and let's look at verse 20. moreover the lord thy god will send the hornets among them until they are that until they that are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyed thou shall not be frightened at them for the lord thy god is among you a mighty god and terrible and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by little and little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee but the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed you got that every israelite needs to hold on to that here's the promise i'll send the hornet to drive out even the ones that hide from you i'll drive them out but he says i'll drive them out little by little so that the land is not overwhelmed by the beast then he says and the lord said verse 23 i'll deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed that's the promise now let's go to numbers numbers 33. just a few pages to the left numbers 33 and verse 51 33-51 speaking to the children of israel and saying to them when you are passed over jordan to the land of canaan then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants i'm confused god said he would drive them out now he's telling them to drive them out so how is god going to drive them out he's going to use the israelites yeah you know we get such carnal understanding sometimes the scripture i'll drive them out i'll move them away i'll drive them out and give you the land now you go i've come down most deliver the people now you go i i'm gonna drive out the inhabitants of the land now you drive out the inhabitants of the land what was it when israel was marching that was god marching amen when israel was fighting god was fighting for them amen this was god moving the inhabitants out of the land because they would take his word and obey his word because god is in partnership with man and until they kept until they were willing to march forward god was god was handicapped god's program was paralyzed see brother brandon's not just making stuff up when he makes statements like that he's taking it right out of the scripture amen when they refuse to go god's system god's program is paralyzed because i'll drive the mount i'll move the mount i'll move the mount he says you drive the mount because i've given you the land for a possession now wherever your foot lands that's your possession i'll give it to you god in partnership with man nothing has changed today friends let's keep reading verse 52 again then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it and you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the to the more you shall give them more inheritance and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance every man's inheritance shall be in the in the place whereas lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sights and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell god you said that all i have to do is believe in you and you'll do it all you told moses and moses said he's going to give us the land you're going to you said god you're going to drive them out now god says you drive the mount and there's no contradiction in the plan of god because this is god's chosen nation god's chosen people and he promised to be with them and when they would march forward he was there when they took a step he was there but god was in partnership with the nation of israel and we know what happened we know they began while joshua was the general they began to conquer and conquer and conquer and conquer until they utterly destroyed nation after nation after nation and he began to divide the land and as he divided the land there was still inhabitants in parts of the land and and the the each tribe was supposed to drive out the people from their own land but we found out when you go to read this tribe couldn't drive out this one and this drive couldn't fully possess the land here and what did they do they they they got tired of the fight and when they got tired of the fight they made a deal with the canaanites and the hittites and the jebusites and they put them under tribute and they made a deal why because they got tired of the fight because it says they could take the lowlands but they couldn't take the highlands or they could take the high and could take the law i don't remember but they couldn't take this nation because they had iron chariots and they couldn't take this one for another reason reasoning reasoning reasoning reasoning and they forgot that god said i will drive them out little by little he didn't promise amen i'll walk in one month and the next are running out the back door and you just go and settle down in the land he said i'll give it to you i'll drive them out i'll send the hornet i'll give you the then he says you go and you possess it and wherever your feet is i'll give it to you you drive out the inhabitants of the land amen and if you don't drive them out they'll become pricks in your size and thorns in your flesh and they forgot they heard the promised word but they forgot the stipulation that you have to put your foot there and it'll drive them out little by little and if god promises all the promises of abraham why am i still suffering with the complex why am i still suffering with an old thing from my past that's hanging on why am i still he's promised to deliver you friends amen but don't make a deal with a with an iron chariot don't make a deal because the jebusites have a strong hold on high that strong on high became jerusalem that was jerusalem became the city of david amen god had a tremendous plan for the jebusite stronghold but they could never take this jebusite stronghold until david come on the scene and they thought it's too much amen it was a hard battle because god had some glory for that place and the most glorious places are sometimes the places we fight for the most see if you if they heard everything that was said i'll drive them out little by little then if they didn't get them out this battle they'll try it next battle because it's got to go there's see me realize god make no provision for not driving them out amen if they weren't droven out it wasn't god's fault because god would keep his end of the deal in the partnership amen but the free moral agency part on theirs amen was that was the was the cause of partial success and i wonder today what is the cause of partial success is it god or is it us it may be that you know god saw in his wisdom that when we came to the lord he wouldn't remove every obstacle in our life because we couldn't fully possess all that land all at once but god in our life is taking out complexes and habits and desires little by little is that true in your life one of the most discouraging things for us when we give our heart to the lord we see god do such a miraculous work in our life everything changes and then few months or a year down the road amen we find ourselves struggling with something we didn't think we ever struggle with again we thought god was going to just drive out there and say god was going to take care of all of it amen but he didn't realize amen god said where you put your foot you've got to go into that complex you've got to go into that habit and you've got to face it head-on and move into that so that god can move the enemy out we don't put it under tribute we don't ignore it acting like it's not living there but we keep facing it and keep pressing the battle and keep pressing the battle because he's promised to drive it out little by little if we don't drive it out that old thing that come from our childhood and that complex and that old habit if we don't drive it out it'll become a prick in our eyes and a thorn in our flesh and most of us have lived long enough to serve the lord to realize that's nothing but the truth don't put it under tribute keep pressing the battle keep taping the sword of the word and keep pressing that sword of the word amen and god will move it out of there we can't make a deal with it we can't we can't act like it's not there we've got to deal with these things in our lives because god is on partnership with us if you put it under tribute god won't move it if you let it stay and don't fight it it won't go but we gotta fight it friends and fight it and fight it and fight it how long fight it until it's gone not gone today fight it tomorrow if it's not gone tomorrow fight it the next day if that old complex is still tripping up a week for now fight it again press the battle amen if you can get your foot there you can have it if you reason if you resist the devil the devil will flee god's already done it now he's telling us to do it we're in partnership with god god does nothing without man brother branham said in possessing the gates of the enemy after the trial from 1964 but what did joshua do he stilled the people he said wait a minute we are more than able to take it no matter how little we are how much in the minority what was he doing he was standing true to that promise i give you this land but you fight every inch of it do you believe that mother god has given you your healing but you'll fight every inch of it everywhere the soles of your feet sets that i give you for possession footprints means possession it's all yours every promise belongs to you but you'll fight every inch of the way in now in adoption brother brahman says in his promised land everything belongs to us in the promised land see brother collins see everything in the promised land when israel crossed over jordan into the promised land fought down everything now remember in this promised land that don't mean that you're immune from sickness that don't mean that you're immune from troubles but it does spell this oh let this sink deep it says this that it's yours just rise up and take it see we've crossed over amen we've crossed over into the promised land we've crossed over into the word we've crossed over into the fullness of the holy ghost but that doesn't mean you're immune from sickness and immune from troubles what it means is all the promises are yours and remember the only way that israel ever lost a man is when sin got in the camp that's the only way we could ever lose a victory is for sin to get in the camp something wrong somewhere when aiken stole that wedge and that babylonian garment sin was in the can and the battle went wrong in adoption part two he says joshua said god i want you right in here lays your place according to the blueprint your place lays here right here you get in there gad and stay in here benjamin you go right down here and now you all stay away from the border of the philistines joshua comes back here they all are over in the philistines having a big old shindig just dancing up like that and all the women painted up and dancing around having a big time and joshua scratches his head and says now what now that's just exactly what's taking place not all thank god not all but too many what he's saying is he divide up the land he gave the borders he wanted separation and then they begin to mix and then they begin to lose everything it wasn't joshua's fault it wasn't god's fault amen let's go to first corinthians and when we go to read this i want to remind you of all the things we read about the apostle paul first corinthians 9. the apostle paul said he was an apostle by the will of god he was chosen by the grace of god that the dispensation of the mystery would be given to him not through study by revelation he knew that god separated him from another woman and called him and he was ordained to do a work to take to be a light unto the gentiles to fulfill isaiah he knew he was fulfilling prophecy he knew he was called by god he knew he was chosen before the foundation of the world he knew he was predestinated but look what he says in first corinthians 9 and 24 know you not they that which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we are incorruptable i therefore so run not as uncertain so finally not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway paul's revelation of his calling his election his position paul knew he wasn't changing his mind on ephesians 1. but paul's revelation of his security and his position never allowed paul to get laxed in his own life the apostle paul kept under his body the apostle paul brought his body in the subject and the apostle paul ran so that he would be the one to win the prize he wasn't a lazy christian he wasn't a soft christian amen he didn't pretend god was a doting grandpa who would never punish him or correct him amen he didn't have that attitude he had the attitude that i'm running to win this race i'm running i am denying myself i'm being temperate in all things i'm controlling my passions my lust my likes my appetites to win this race the apostle paul he was very secure in his position amen but he recognized that in the security in his position that if he does not keep under himself and control himself and deny himself that he was going to lose this race that he was going to fall short not change his predestination but fall short the remember says in the uniting time and sign some people tries to introduce christianity that you're free from worry no you're not you're free from tension oh no you add tension when you become a christian because you're kind of a slop go happy go lucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did but when you become a real christian every moment you're wondering am i pleasing my lord if i could hear from him it puts you on tension put you on guard it doesn't say i'm eternally secure i can no more be lost and god can be lost i can sit here and watch this nascar race all day long and god don't care he loves me nobody puts you on guard and says is this pleasing to god is this what he wants me to do is this is this going to get me where i want to go am i having victory over the devil am i pressing the battle you see it's it doesn't change i mean brother ben said i could go down on the river and i could fish every day of my life and not lose my salvation he'd be just as saved as he's always saved he's just a child of god as he always that was secure before the foundation of the world amen so brother benham wasn't out there suffering amen he wasn't suffering rejection suffering hardship suffering the the lack of his family's love amen suffering the rejection the the hostile environments the hot meeting crowds the exhaustion the sore throat the sicknesses you realize he wasn't doing all that to gain more merit with god to secure a position in heaven he was doing that because he loved god because he saw the program of god he knew that he could go sit on the bank of a river and fish every day of his life and have the same salvation but what did he sacrifice for he sacrificed for god brother man says in hebrews chapter 6. grace is what god did for me works is what i do for god now they'll make a doctrine out of it they think that the works is what wins your merits if it is it isn't a free gift grace is what god did for you by grace you're saved and works is what you do in appreciation of the grace that he showed to you if you love him you like to do the works of the lord certainly because then you love him brotherhood says in 1965 and knoweth it not and what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting out as a lodge it's christ can't come until the church is perfectly right he is waiting on us when did he say that august 15 1965 he is waiting on us i believe we're at the end he can't finish this work until the church is perfectly right because the bride has made herself ready she's in partnership with god god has given the word and she's putting it on he gave her the word she's putting it on amen and as he's unveiling more of the word she's putting it on the bride has made herself ready let's turn to philippians i want to read this last scripture as we go philippians chapter 3. philippians chapter 3 and verse 12. before we read i want to remind you again of the apostle paul the apostle paul was secure in his position he knew his calling and election he knew who he was and what he was called for he met the pillar of fire the pillar of fire called him amen then he sent ananias a prophet to tell him that his position was he was a chosen vessel of god and what he must suffer he went into the the wilderness of arabia and received the revelation from jesus christ himself on the mystery of god to the old testament he wasn't worried about whether he was predestinated or not he wasn't worried about whether he was chosen and elected or not so that keep that in mind when we read philippians 3 12 not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus if we had been called by a pillar of fire and heard the voice of god and had god meet us in arabia and give us divine revelation by himself and if we had seen miracles and and all kinds of things it would be easy to get relaxed and say god loves me chosen me everything's fine with me and god but paul says i run this race to win it i am temperate in all things i keep after my body so that i'm not a cast away i don't claim to have already attained that thing that apprehended me but i'm pressing i'm pushing i'm climbing i'm striving to the mark of the high calling in christ jesus why god is in partnership with man and as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we are paralyzing the program of god he is waiting on us when the canaanites wouldn't move because they had iron chariots what was god waiting on he was waiting for them to keep pushing them back push them back if you win an inch it's yours they could just keep that mentality go to battle again but they're iron chariots but i'm not you know what i'm not hoping to see them turn down and run away i just need to get another inch why because if i can walk there it's mine he promised it to me they got lazy because it was hard it was hard work it was labor intensive it was difficult and they wanted to go ahead and enjoy the privileges and the promises that they had already got they wanted to settle down with their little kids they wanted to play with their kids in their yard and grow food in their garden and nothing different than what you and i want don't want to always be in strife i don't always want to be fighting a battle i don't always want to be pushing against evil i just want to enjoy my kids i just want to play human beings i've been human beings for 6 000 years they haven't changed all of a sudden so they put them under tribute they made a deal we won't fight you you don't fight us but the very children that they wanted to play with and the grandchildren they wanted to enjoy were the ones that became in bondage to the same canaanites that they wouldn't drive out and you think your complex and your compromise is not going to affect your children and your grandchildren see what is it what is it you want what are you coming back again one inch i want to get another foothold i want to resist the devil i want to be free from this complex free from this habit free from this thinking i want to be free the only way for my freedom is for me in partnership with god he promised me he's kept his and he'll always keep his end i just want to get another inch that's all the farther i get today that's okay because he's promised little by little he'll drive them out the promise is it'll go sickness will go i just i just want to get another inch realize friends he's on partnership we're not waiting on god god's done everything he's going to do he's waiting on us partnership with man ephesians one through three that gives me complete rest in my heart total rest and satisfaction that no matter what if i fail tomorrow nothing's changed with god my position with god will a rod come down yes will i suffer yes amen will i get sick every time i come up over the knobs maybe you realize brother branham had to go visit a grave and lay flowers at a grave of a baby and a wife because of disobedience will you suffer absolutely will it change your sonship no what did he have to do keep pressing the battle keep pressing yesterday's failures or yesterday's failures keep pressing the battle the suffering from the mistake i made is the suffering i'll suffer if i suffer the rest of my life i'll suffer but i'm going to press the battle because god's in partnership with me and he's depending on me to take the second half of ephesians and put put it into flesh and live it out by his grace by his spirit amen he's given us his spirit he's given us his word now he's waiting for the bride to put the word on and display it to the world say friends let's not quit fighting let's not quit pressing it sounds good god put man on partnership with him we're partners we're joint heirs 50 50. that just gives you a position of responsibility who much is given much is expected and i said god help me to have the attitude of the apostle paul i don't claim to have attained where i need to be i don't claim to have gotten a hold of this thing that's gotten a hold of me but i'm pressing toward the mark of the high calling in christ i'm not running just hoping that i'll make it across i'm running to win this race i'm beating this body and putting subjection i'm denying myself pleasures that the flesh wants thoughts that the flesh wants to think on denying them fighting the battle pressing the iron chariots again and again and again winning one foothold by one foothold by one foothold until eventually it's gone many of you have fought battles for years family situations complexes sicknesses in your body fought it for years but you got deliverance didn't you it didn't come instantly it might have been weeks it might have been months might have been years but god moves on that thing if we're willing to stick with it with the word of god and keep moving forward we want things out of our lives god's own partnership with us we want things to change around us god's own partnership with us we want to climb higher god's own partnership with us you understand we've got to keep climbing friends we've got to keep pressing we've got to keep striving we're caught to keep breeding our body into obedience we've got to do the thing we can do because god will do the thing we can't but the thing god can't do is force you because he put us on a law a free moral agency if i'll do what god's asked me to do he'll do what he promised he'll do but god cannot pick me up stick me here so he can bless me he can tell me to go here for a blessing and i have to move over of my own free moral agency to receive it you know what i wish i don't really wish but i could say this way many wish you could have lazy boy religion kick the legs up if god wants me to have it i'll have it if he doesn't i won't what do you mean he already said he wants you to have it if he wants me to be healed i'll be healed if he doesn't want me to be healed i won't be healed his word already says he healed your disease he wants you to be healed his word is his will his will is his word well if it's the will of god i'll get better if it's not the will of god i won't that's not the attitude he wants the attitude he wants is it's his will i'm healed i'm pressing this thing until i'm completely delivered see no no no bowing out of the partnership no bowing out of our commitments say it's all on him whatever he wants will happen if he wants if he wants this to happen to him if he wants that to happen it'll happen what about us just keeping his word and believing him what about us exercising our faith and his promises and watching them come on the scene what about us crying out for deliverance like they did in israel in egypt god is waiting for us to ask and believe what we ask for so that he can come on the scene you realize when god was recreating the earth and repositioning the earth amen to be inhabited now for a garden of eden he had to speak his own word and believe his own word before it would come to pass and he's put us the same way he's asking us to take his word to speak his word and believe his word so that he can bring it to pass he's looking for somebody to take him out of his word so he can come on the scene how do you call jesus on the scene believe his word and stand on his word you'll call him on the scene god bless you let's stand musicians should come god is so good to us friends he's so good to us to give us his word you realize god's goodness is expressed in his word sometimes we think god's goodness is expressed in a way that a grandfather would spoil a grandson but god's goodness is expressed in his word and if we'll just take that word which is the goodness of god and put it on us apply it stand on it press forward with it we'll see god do everything that he said he'll do and he wants to but he's got to be somebody that'll believe it and act on it man let's just pray lord jesus we thank you father for your word and god what a simple lesson today but what a profound lesson god you showed us something out of your word and through the message lord that would change our lives if we could apply it if we could activate our faith lord and stand in the face of opposition upon your word and keep moving forward lord we would see you do mighty things you've done mighty things for us in the past and you'll do mighty things in the future help us lord help us to keep our end of the partnership help us to be faithful to your word and faithful to obey faithful to live faithful to take your word and put it on give us the courage lord to keep moving forward for footsteps our possession open your word to us in a greater way lord that we might see what you want in this hour and give us a heart lord to obey may we lord do all that we can to bring our bodies into subjection to be temperate in all things to keep climbing towards the mark of your high calling we love you lord because you told us the first three chapters of ephesians and you set it like a stone in our hearts we can't be lost we can't fail you'll not fail to keep your promise begone when we look at the second half of ephesians what you're asking us to do we realize lord that we need to subject ourselves unto you humble ourselves rely on the spirit you gave us and the word to keep us to deny to deny ourselves and deny the flesh and to deny wrong thinking and just take you at your word god i love you i love your people i ask all you continue to work with us move us forward let us be that mighty marching army marching back into zion lord to take full possession of the full promise to go all the way back to a glorified condition with eternal life go all the way back to the perfection in the garden god i pray you give us that strength to march all the way home we give you glory and
