========================================

there's a country far beyond the starry sky oh there's a city where there never comes a night and if we're faithful we shall go there by and by oh just here we have our days of sunshine but we know that the sun which shines upon us now so bright we'll be changing clouds and rain until we go to that city where the lamp is [Music] [Applause] it shall be one eternal dick without a knife and our tears shall forever be wiped away oh in that city where the lamp is alive oh in that city where the lamp is is live here we have our disappointments all the while and our bond is hopes but meet with bitter blood though by night we weep the morning brings a smile in that city where the lamp is twilight bring its gloom not a shadow can my blissful soul of rock before i load it up in heaven in that city where the lamp [Music] amen aren't you glad you have a mansion over there this morning of the lord is in this place i can feel his mighty power and his grace i can hear the brush of angel's wings i see glory surely the presence of the lord is in this place [Music] is [Music] [Music] praise god amen god bless you all it's good to be with you this morning let's while we're standing just take our bibles and turn to hebrews chapter 11. amen i was encouraged to hear about the youth getting together to help sister land that was such a wonderful thing brother kyle sent me pictures and a list of all they did and they're an amazing work crew and uh we should really be thankful for them and we thank you for the effort you put forth and i know sister luanne was blessed man it's good to use your strength for someone else amen god has all given us something something we can do for the body something we do for one another and it's nice when we find those two meat a need and an ability when they come together brings a blessing so we thank god for that let's start here hebrews chapter 11. i'm going to continue on with religion versus relationship i believe this is part five and my subtitle for this is conquered or drawn conquered or drawn hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report so you know we've read through this so many times but you can never just get away from the realities the truth that's laying here and it becomes deeper and deeper all the time because faith is the substance of things hoped for so faith is a substance it's not it's not a trivial thing it's not a light passing thought but faith is a substance amen so we can't think of faith as just an idea or a mental concept or or a thought that passes through the mind faith is much different than that amen faith is an anchoring and faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence amen so many people want evidence that they're a christian evidence of this and we're looking for evidences faith is the evidence amen the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the world's refrained by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so when brother branham says when god created the world he had to speak his word and believe his own word it comes right from this scripture here because we know that through faith we understand the worlds were framed whose faith god's faith amen god had to believe his own word he had to speak and believe his own word believing his word would come to pass amen for by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god i want to walk like enoch so that i can walk right on out of here who wants to walk like enon so enoch had a testimony and the testimony before that he left was that he pleased god so i want to do what enoch did amen and so verse 6 holds the key but without faith it is impossible to please him amen what did enoch do that pleased him he not believed what god told him but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word father we just ask all that you would do what you've done so many times that you honor your word lord as we've come to honor it lord and gather ourselves together as your word says and we're trusting lord in your method while we ask that you come on the scene and do what you've done for us so many times because you are faithful to keep your word that you would come and break the bread of life and speak your eternal word to us for we have need of it in this hour we need your word to be our light lord to guide us in this day that we live in and we need it to be our sustaining portion that gives us strength to continue in the journey that you have for us we ask that you would take preeminence among us and you will be pleased with all that's said and done may we receive you lord as you reveal yourself to us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated i'm going to read just two quotes that we've been reading all along just to bring it keep it fresh in our minds he says in the god of this evil age he says and notice cain he didn't want no blood sacrifice he came down and offered the fruit or the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious i want you to catch that and i hope you're i hope this is a common theme now over these last few weeks that we're we're holding on to that very religious so the false vine is very religious the false vine isn't necessarily the ones who are are out in the in the bars and in the nightclubs and things like that the false vine is very religious and those two vines amen in the book of genesis they begin to intertwine amen and they begin to wrap around one another until it's very hard to discern between the true and the false vine because they're all wrapped around one another amen and and they look like they're in one group but at the end of the church ages brother branham was the one who was able to come back and he was able to point out that all through the church ages there was two groups because every message to every age was a message to two different groups there was the message that those who kept the word amen those who were faithful and there was a message to those who weren't and brother madam at the end of the ages he began to unravel the church ages and when he's unraveling the church ages he was showing the two vines within the framework of the true church and so now we know that he was very religious done everything that just exactly like abel done offered a sacrifice fell down before god in worship obedient every day but without the revelation of the word and the word was from the beginning god's plan oh if we could just catch that ingrain that date deep down into your soul the word was from the beginning god's plan this was god's plan when man fell he fell from the word amen when god is going to restore he's going to restore man back to the word amen because the word was from the beginning god's plan and that's why in our day the full revelation of the full word had to be restored because from the beginning that was god's plan so and the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god so what is the path back the path back is by the revelation of the word of god it's the only path back and the message god hiding himself in simplicity he says in the beginning when man sinned it showed the nature of man he all he's always trying to hide from god oh just catch this friends this is religion he's talking about religion he's talking about churches and doctrines and denominations and man's reasoning he says god man from the beginning when man sinned he showed the nature of man he's always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion so this is what man is always trying to do and if we understand that's what man is always trying to do that's what he's always tried to do that's what he's currently trying to do and that's what the devil is trying to tempt you to do what me who do you think he's gunning for who do you think he was always trying to work where god was working he was always trying to trip up the elect and bind them and keep the plan of god from progressing amen satan is trying to stop the forward momentum of redemption he's trying to stop god's plan from coming into fruition so where would he work amen where where would he bring deception where would he bring a disruption amen what would he do in this day if he wants to stop the forward momentum of god's redemptive plan and the word moving forward amen to bring a full restitution of all things what would he attack would he go and bring a deception amen amen where where would he go he would come right to where god's working right to where the word is and try to do what he's always done he's tried to bring a diversion a deception a reasoning bring something else to stop the plan of god amen when the word's been unfolded and and brother brahms shows us this very clearly he says you know in luther's day luther got amen a word and that word was to begin to bring the people's attention and attraction back to god so luther's word that he brought was a way back into fellowship with god amen and he brought justification by faith but then fallen angels amen fallen angels got in and they turned they took that truth amen and and then instead of going on with the truth and coming into where they are now they got them to denominate or build a system or a city a walled city around that truth and when they did he stopped the forward progress of the elect that's always been the the attempt but god will always raise somebody up to bring a word to bring them out and bring them up god's word is always progressing but the devil is always trying to stop the progress of god's word so so we can look at temptation i mean all over the place but if we don't recognize that those same spirits are present today and those those same spirits are trying to disrupt god's plan and we know god's plan and we know where god's working why would we look anywhere else but all around us for deception even in our own minds and our own thinking amen the temptations and the thoughts that would come i mean we have to judge every thought and bring every thought a captive into obedience unto christ that's what paul tells us to do because the temptation is all around us trying to stop the forward progress of god's word if he can take oh friends listen in this day if he can stop and guilt us to build denominational walls amen he doesn't mind how much past truth you accept once god opened the door to justification by faith amen the devil never tried to take away justification by faith because even the catholic church now is willing to adopt justification by faith as long as justification by faith still makes you require the priesthood in the sacraments they're willing to adjust amen so now that the now the revelations out he he can never put the revelation back in so what he wants to do is now get you to stop at this revelation and not move to the next revelation and when god called abraham out abraham was called separated and removed out of the trouble of babylon removed out of from the scattering from babylon and god broke that system up because he had to get that elect out of that system so he can begin to deal with him as an individual that's the same thing that's happened in our day god through the prophet has broke that he's took the sword of the word and writ writ the denominational veil into so that he can call us out of that system so that he can deal with us as an individual so abraham in his journey you recognize that abraham dwelt in tents tabernacles with isaac and with jacob amen abraham never built a city cain goes out and builds a city nimrod builds a city and the tower amen everybody goes to do something to perform something to build something to keep propagating amen their own idea and their own religion but abraham never builds a city why doesn't abraham build a city because abraham was looking for a city that has foundations whose builder and maker was god and if you're looking for the city there's no reason to build a city they're saying if you're if you here here today looking for a city whose builder and maker is gone amen there is no reason to start a denomination to build a city to stack stones together amen if you build a city it goes to prove amen that you're not looking for that city so the devil's always trying to get them to build a city of lutheran and build a city of wesley build a city of pentecostals amen and not get them to continue being a pilgrim and a stranger looking abraham was told by god he said now after he finally separated from lot as we were speaking last time and he and he stood up he brought him and he said now behold north south east the west i've given all you said walk the land abraham there is no reason for abraham to settle down because abraham was still discovering the promised land and because abraham was still he was a pilgrim amen because he was still traveling the promises and searching out the promises and and in different places god would come and meet to him in this place and in this place and it was all within the promise all within the land amen god would begin to come and meet with him from this place to this place of this place so he was walking with god he was walking before god he was obeying the word of the lord because the word of the lord told him to walk this land and as he's walking this land and we know that our land our inheritance is this word that's been restored and because he's constantly discovering the land communing with the lord walking before the lord as he walks in the land there is no reason for him to establish amen a single place of worship there's no reason for him to establish a religion to establish a city to establish anything because he was still walking the land and i want to say today that this bride is still walking the land amen she's walking before the lord and she's walking in the promises and still discovering all that's been given to her amen all the word that has been opened amen as we walk through the land amen we're discovering what's over the next hill and then the next valley and the next stream and the next whatever so there's no reason for us to settle down amen the the when you begin to settle down and build a city and build a singular place of worship and all of these things when you do that you're testifying that i've already walked all the land there is to walk when we when when and and listen the devil is trying with desperately trying and working with the very nature of man the very nature that's in you the wrong nature that come through hybridization trying to get us to settle down on these truths that we have just like in luther and luther's day just like in wesley's day just like in pentecostal let's go ahead and build a walled city and believe the message and from this walled city start defending the message and this will become our carved out territory and nobody better get into territory and we'll begin from here to defend the message because when you build a city you have to defend the city in fact when you start building a city you have to do a lot of work to maintain the city it takes a lot of effort to keep city life going that's religion but all abraham had to do was walk the land gather all he had and walk the land and discover all that god had promised and all that god had given to him amen he was there to walk the land to discover it and because he was still discovering the promise of god there was no reason for him to settle down so he would dwell in tabernacles oh god is good man is always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified not be justified feel justified and i'd like to make this statement it doesn't matter if you feel justified if you're not it doesn't matter if you feel good if you're not in a good place because you can do many religious things that feel good but feeling good is not equivalent to being good or even being right so we can't base it on feelings although the feelings are are are a byproduct feelings come there you don't can't have you can't have a a worship and a faith without some feelings coming attached to it but when it's based upon the feelings then it's easy to go into error so man is trying to hide from god so this is the purpose of religion this is abraham or adam's covering when he said he covered himself with his own doing his own making his own fig leaf religion he sewed it together and made a covering and he was hiding he was trying to hide his sin from god without an atonement but with his own works and when he tried to cover himself amen he's trying to make a way where he feels justified he now feels okay he now feels covered he said a man can feel justified a religion that's been a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion this is the nature of man this is what man has always tried to do this is what man will continue to try to do let's go to hebrews 11 and continue on i'm backing up just a bit but we're gonna we're gonna grab this in genesis 11. genesis we're going to go back to genesis genesis 11. verse 1. and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journey from the east and they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there they said one to another go too let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they from order now we've been reading this and going through this and we find out that they've gathered themselves together now to build a city and a tower we'll get that minute but i want to back up to the previous verse and i want to talk about the the ringleader for all of this and nimrod so let's go back to chapter 10 and i think i want to read from verse 6. yeah and the sons of ham kush in mizrahim and foot and canaan and the sons of kush siba and havilah and sabtan rhema and these other names verse 8 and kush begotten nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth i want you to catch that he began to be this is something new that's happening amen this is the first time this is mentioned in the genealogies we don't have any of this description so the bible is written in a way to catch your attention to draw you into something and so now this one is going to rise up to be over the others amen and krishna got nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth you know what this tells me when i read this what i take away is i don't want to be a mighty one in the earth but that's the desire of man man's always promoting himself and one's trying to climb over top the other amen but i don't want to be a mighty one in the earth amen i want to be one of those that are from heaven and i want to be one of those whose name is written in heaven amen on the lamb's book of life that's what matters to me and kush begotten imran he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord before it wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and eric and akkad and kaunai in the land of shinar out of that land went forth asher and built in nineveh and the city the city rehoboth and kayla and risen between nineveh and kela the same as a great city so this is injected into the genealogies and this injection is for a purpose amen we find out that he was a mighty hunter before the lord and so there's many ways that you can read this in many takes on on how you can interpret this but but plain and simply he said he was a mighty hunter before the lord or in the presence of the lord and you can see how there there could be a deception amen and a misunderstanding of his might in the source of his might and his strength and the source of his strength amen just like lamech lamech would begin to find that that you know if if cain uh was protected by the lord and vengeance would be taken sevenfold on amanda to destroy cain now that i have murdered a man to defend myself see this is always the issue he was defending himself he's killed a man to my hurt amen and he said now if cain be avenged seven times then lamech 70 times seven you know he's he's he's taking the same promise as though it's a good thing as though he's in the righteous line as though he's under the protection of god amen and that very generation would be the generation that's destroyed by the flood and now we have nimrod amen he's coming he's a descendant of noah amen he come from noah to ham to nimrod that's what the genealogies say and so now he's got this genealogy amen that that he he is in the right line amen let's just say it that way and becomes to become a mighty one and then he becomes a mighty hunter before the lord and you can see how there would be a misunderstanding of where all his might and his talents and his strengths and his abilities came from and it became a a justification or maybe even a vindication so nimrod became the mighty one and he went out and he established all these cities and he had a large kingdom this was apparently not the case before amen after the flood because it was mentioned here this way he begins to establish an empire and brother branham said in god's chosen place of worship he said nothing is typed in the old testament anywhere in the bible of the church but the forced unity at babel tower we're showing the church the the modern uh uh idea of church and denomination brother says not listed in the bible only in the forced unity of the bible tower and let's go back and read our scripture again let's go back to chapter 11. verse 3 and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and the tower whose top may reach into heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth so they wanted they wanted here a city and the tower to protect themselves from being scattered on the whole earth which was contrary to the commandment of god because god told him to multiply and replenish the whole earth he wanted them to go out and reestablish the earth amen but they wanted to gather themselves together and then in case they wanted to build for themselves a name now they're no longer promoting the name of the lord now they want to build for themselves the name and brother bam saying this is the picture of church of denomination he wanted to build for herself a name lest they be scattered upon the earth so they're going to gather themselves together to make a name for themselves and to protect themselves and now the religion the religion becomes the mechanism by which they deny the word and the religion becomes their protection from the word it becomes a barrier to the word or protection from the word and now the walled city listen the walled city the walled city in israel when you gave up your inheritance in israel to move to a walled city because when they come into the land of uh and when they come into the land of canaan and they divided up the land to israel everybody got a portion of land amen and they got a portion uh by lots according to the size of their family and the size of their tribe they were given a portion and that portion was their land and we know that that was super symbolic and very important because uh naboth would not give up his inheritance although abel uh um not able ahab offered him more money and another piece of land that was better it wasn't the quality of the land that naboth wanted it was the promise of his fathers amen that he was holding on to his portion that god placed him in and ahab offered him a better portion and more money and he said far be it for me i will not give up the land of my inheritance so the inheritance was so important but if you sold your inheritance and you went into the walled city amen when there come a time of jubilee when everybody could go back to their inheritance you were stuck in the walled city and could not go back you see well the devil's always trying to get us to enter into the walled city amen to enter in and refuse the freedom that comes from redemption so he says now the church they said there's nowhere nothing typed in the old testament or anywhere in the bible of the church but the forced unity of babel tower that's the only thing that types to unity because it was by nimrod a wicked man who went out and forced all the little countries to come into one place in this great tower it was a religious worship of course but not considered in the word of god is there so there is where you see denominational religion typed the tower of babel in the old testament which is which this religion was certainly a religion but not the religion of the word of god so when you want to see denominationalism religious denominationalism you find it in the tower of bible in the message god's provided place of worship the prophet says and now we see this forced religion right in view now to bring all the little groups into one great unity they call it some of them believe in this and some believe in that some deny this and some deny that and the bible said how can two walk together except they be agreed it'll never work we've got to be in agreement and what in agreement with what not in agreement with one another this is good not in agreement with one another if we can get ourselves in agreement with one another that will bring a false unity catch this if we can get a little group of us together and we all agree together that agreement with one another will bring a false unity not in agreement with one another as much as we've got to be in agreement with the word with god that'll bring true unity amen that is what it's got to be in agreement with now we find out enforced unity was represented by groups of people at babylon god cannot put his name in such a thing as that he never did and he never will though they tried it they put their name into it put his name into it but it's not so he said in the message the god of this evil age said notice this plan to build a super denominational church the world council of churches see a super denominate so that all the world will worship him the beast under the name of united christianity would you like to read it in the bible revelation 13 6 8 it's a modern tower of babylon don't you remember how that nimrod that hypocrite built the big tower and made all the other little cities pay tribute to it babel babel is the same thing it just changes its name and as it comes on up it's rome is now babylon and the whole world is brought to babylon and is brought in by the world council of the churches which will make every one of them bow to her and you took the mark of the beast not knowing what you're doing because but those who are elected will hear the word and come out of it as we hear the word those who are elected will hear the word and come out of it let's turn together to revelation 13 and read this that brother branham referred to revelation 13 and 11. and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon we've been through this before brother branham is referring to the united states coming up where there's no multitudes of people coming up out of the land he had two horns like a lamb but it wasn't a lamb just like a lamb brother man said it was the buffalo the american buffalo said these two horns were ecclesiastical and civil and they type they type all the way back to the tower of nimrod when he said let us build a city civil and a tower religious ecclesiastical so we caught that because everything begins in genesis right we're firm believers of that and he spake as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first beast before him and caused the earth and them which dwelt therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonder so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast all right now the beast system is the catholic church amen and so now he this this american system is going to convince the world to make an image to the beast and brother ben said a world council of churches or a union an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life into the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed you know there's some people out there there's some in religious circles that teach that there's going to be actually a statue made and and and be a man of sin that will give life to this it's all spiritual religious amen it's a unified you know when god came down and he confounded the languages of the tower of babylon now they could not comprehend or understand one another amen and they separated themselves out to actually perform the word of god by scattering and multiplying greatly upon the earth amen they could not communicate or understand they they didn't understand one another and because they didn't understand one another they left off building the city because it wasn't yet time amen but they're going to come back and finish building that city and that's right here at the end time so they left off so in order amen in order to come back they have to come back into a common understanding or a common language they say well everybody's going to speak english and speak dancing that's not google translate can take care of that and you wonder why google translate even came on the scene today so that we can bring everybody back to one language now it doesn't matter what language you speak but to me it doesn't matter you can still translate all the languages into one but if you don't understand one another you still don't come back to the common mind the common thinking the common understanding that will come back to start building the city again but what's happening in the world what have we seen amen in the last year or two amen the world is coming into one thinking amen one frame of mind and that frame of mind is we are all linked together we are all united what happens in china happens in america happens in india happens in south america amen we've got to do something to get control of this globe and now the reasoning and wisdom of man is now starting to align it's been separated by culture it's been separated by language it's been separated from by boundaries for so many years but what we're watching is a common understanding coming into man to where they're beginning to understand one another again do you see it they're beginning to think alike beginning to comprehend one another again and now what would it do all that they imagined to do because that's what was stopped and so now they're going to continue to build the city let me just keep reading and finish this passage of scripture and he had power to give life into the image of the beast so this union this world council church this union and then they'll take full control it is america the beast that rose out of the land amen that will give power amen that it should both live and speak amen because without a powerful backing what power does the united nations have if you take away the main players in fact without the without the united states for a long period of time the united nations would have had no power no authority so it's the same thing amen now this beast that come out of the land with like a lamb with two horns it'll actually give power unto this world council of churches there's a unification of faith it will give it will give a power to it that it can both live and speak and how does it give power because it becomes the enforcing agent amen in verse 15 he had power to give life into the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause it as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he caused all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand are in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell say that he had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here heareth wisdom let him that have understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred three score and six here's what brother branham says in a couple of places this is the message what shall i do with this jesus called christ in 63 says and here we are today forming a system a system we can't we tried to make everybody become a lutheran and couldn't do it tried to make them all become baptist we couldn't do it all become a methodist they're all become pentecostals they couldn't do it so to order to do this the time is so short they have formed a council ahead an image to the beast that's exactly what they've done and brother man i'm saying because they couldn't unify on doctrine they'll become another unification which is a system and that system will unify them listen and they can keep their doctrine you can keep your doctrine if you want to believe in a prophet you can believe in joseph smith or ellen white or william branham if you want to baptize in in jesus name or you want to baptize in titles you're going to do it three times forward or three times backwards you can keep your doctrine but you still have to come into the system there's a deception because you don't have to to drop your teaching your doctrine unless your doctrine's against the system and you can come into this union this boycott or this union this system and so because they could not unify on doctrine now the catholic church has the roman spirit and the roman spirit continued in the catholic church in in rome didn't mind what god you worshipped you catch this it was herod amen who was a who was a proxy king under under caesar under the roman government that rebuilt the temple for the jews and rome didn't care that they rebuilt the temple because rome didn't mind which gods you worshiped as long as you come under the roman system and if you were under the roman system you could keep your gods but you could not reject the system if you rejected the system there was a problem but you could you could worship your gods and rome would conquer and as rome would begin to conquer other places amen they would allow them to keep their gods in fact what they would do is say you can keep your gods and we got more for you too if you want more you can keep your false doctrine but we got more for you if you want more and so now that roman spirit come into the catholic church and at first the catholic church started conquering and trying to bring a forced unity where everybody believed the same thing but that fell through the protestant movement so they changed their tactics amen and now amen that spirit that was moving the catholic church amen began to move into the denominations and now you can believe differently you can keep your doctrine but come into the system what system the roman system which is an antichrist system which goes all the way back to cain it's the cane system and so now it doesn't matter what you believe we can't unify on belief so we will unify for a common purpose a meant for a unity to become one amen to do what to protect ourselves because we're destroying ourselves and it's obvious that man is destroying himself brother branham said god man destroys himself and now we have to find a mechanism by which we can now protect ourselves and we will unify under the common goal of self-protection and self-preservation and that self-protection and self-preservation we would try to be the very attempt to keep the word of god from taking effect or from people obeying the word of god it becomes a barrier to the people brother brahm says in another message in 1964 what shall we do with this jesus called christ so now it's about to reach its final goal again the crucial hours here again what is it crucify him we can't all make them all methodists we can't make them all baptist we can't make all oneness we can't make them all trinity we can't make them all this that or the other but we can have a council where you disagree as far as the east is from the west and the whole thing is wrong it's a satellite to rome that's exactly right and so coming back to where he caused those to have a mark in their head are in their hand brother brandon mentions this in the message the mark of the beast from 54 and he says now you see what the mark of the beast is is the mark of apostasy it's a person who just think that well i belong to church i'm just as good as the next fellow i'm not i belong to this church and you realize where your church organization that you're depending on where it come from do you realize the bible said he that worshipped the beast received his mark or the letter of his name now in the forehead or hand that's knowledge or deed that don't mean you get a big tattoo on your face it don't have to be that it's not talking the outward it's talking of spiritual in 1960 says now i want just for the squeezing down part before we leave in the next few minutes now the seal of god is the holy spirit all know that don't you all right we all know that that the seal of god is the holy spirit you take revelation 9 1-4 you'll find that they all had the seal in their forehead first corinthians 1 22 paul said whereby he has sealed us by his holy spirit unto the day ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit that's the angel that come forth sealing upon their forehead now that doesn't mean you he takes and puts a spot on there your forehead is your revelation and your hand is the thing you do about it it's a spiritual mark he don't take a big stamp and stamp you like that it's a spiritual mark because the spiritual mark it marks what what for the holy ghost it's your revelation and then what you do about your revelation is the mark of the head and the mark in the hand it's a spiritual mark showing your revelation and your action are aligned and you have the holy ghost you're under the seal but under the the false seal of a false union there's also a mark and in that mark it has to do with your intellectual agreement your intellectual agreement and or what you do your action with the system see you don't actually have to agree with the system to be marked you can have some disagreements with the system but if the system is set in such a way that your your commerce your ability to buy and sell and trade or survive upon the earth as man normally survives if that is now threatened although you're not in agreement with the system but you still are a contributor or participator you're still participating in the system then you receive the protection of the system or the protection of the mark because cain was protected under his mark but but it could look like cain that god agreed with cain and cain said my judgment is too much whoever finds me will kill me and he says oh yeah you're right i'll take vengeance upon them and mark them that nobody should kill them it looked as if god amen had went back on his judgment and he accepted cain and he and he pardoned cain and he protected cain but that's not true he marked cain because it wasn't yet time he had more seed that had to come forth in the redemption he marked him to a later judgment he just deferred judgment so his mark was his protection but it was not his vindication and there was no real safety from eternal damnation in that mark so there's another mark coming up on the earth so don't look friends don't look for a time when they're going to become a mark and what is the mark don't worry about the mark the mark is here the mark is here it's a it's an intellectual agreement you identify with the doctrine you identify with the understanding of the system and you agree with the system amen and even if you don't agree with it but for personal convenience and personal preservation amen you you participate in the system that's the mark and the mark is here the mark of god is here the mark of the beast is here both of them are for protection one of them is self-preservation and one of them is a self-surrender to where under the mark of the of god i surrendered my life i died to myself i received the baptism of the holy ghost and now it's not my life it's his i've been bought with the price amen it's not my life it's his life in me and i may not be able under this mark to preserve my welfare i may not be able to preserve my income i may may not be able to preserve my comfort my preserve my friendships preserve my emotions but i surrender all that for no self-preservation to take the mark of god it's a total surrender and abandonment to self but the mark of the beast is all about self-preservation so i don't lose my relationships my friendships my family my economics my my my means of living amen it's all self-preservation these two marks one is self-abandonment trusting god and one is a lack of faith in god and self-preservation don't look for a mark to mark us here take the mark of god abandon your life quit trying to preserve our life if you save your life you'll lose it but if you lose your life for my sake you shall find it the way up is down it's always opposite to carnal reasoning when you start dealing with god let's go back to genesis chapter 11. genesis chapter 11 verse 5. and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children and men builded and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them when they have what they have which they have imagined to do look at the world we live in the imagination they're contemplating colonizing mars i mean artificial intelligence that becomes scary that can your phone that can hear you have a conversation and you can say something about you know what i next time i'm at the store i need to get xyz and the next time you open up your phone there's an advertisement for that thing you just mentioned artificial intelligence is scary driverless cars and blah blah blah blah blah and all the things that you can mention why it shows that man is coming back to a common understanding because when he comes back to a unity and a common understanding he can do everything that he's imagined in his heart to do this is where we live let's read that again verse 6 and lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down there confound their language and they may not understand one another's speech that was god protecting the elect from the system that when god came down and scattered he was forcing them to keep his word but what he was he trying to do he was trying to get abraham out of that system and get him to himself so that he could have a relationship with abraham so he could reveal himself to abraham so he was breaking up the system but now we've come to a day where god has come down through his word and his word comes to the full revelation of the mystery of god is now revealed and under that mystery amen there's a protection for the believer there's a word that has come and the word has come to bring protection against the system the seals was to show amen the the opening of the seals was to show the antichrist spirit the weaving of two spirits through the church ages was to show the horse riders the anointing on the false vine was to show the whole mechanism of the devil trying to use religion and now trying to use every age trying to use the current present day truth to deceive by you know what he's done he's jumped on board every age and then brought a deception every eighth broader deception every age brought a deception god back all the way back in genesis 11 he come and he broke it up amen for the protection of the elect so its plan of redemption can move forward but at the end time he's not going to stop it now because he's released a word that'll be a protection for his people he's already built for us a tower because christ the lord is a strong tower that the righteous run into and are safe he's already in this day provided an ark he built the ark he's built the tower we have a place of safety and now that the ark is finished amen now that the tower is constructed amen now he can take the bands that were on amen nimrod's kingdom he could take his bands off of babylon he's always destroyed babylon destroyed babylon destroyed babylon and that spirit that moved down he would disrupt it and disrupt it and disrupt it and mr can keep gathering his elect but now at the end time he won't disrupt it anymore now he will pull back he will allow them to come into a common language a common understanding a common mode of thinking so they can do all that they've imagined in their heart and he's not going to disrupt it this time until he's finished his plan of redemption and removed his bride and then he will pass a judgment on the whole thing but he will remove his bride first that's why there's a call in the land that says come out from among her my people it says come out from among them and be separate and touch not of the unclean thing and i will receive you that voice is gone in this day and continues through the bride calling come out come out come out there's an ark come into the ark of safety amen which is christ himself christ has come there's a safety place on the earth now let me finish reading here verse 17 go to let us go down in there and confound their language and they may not understand one another speech so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of the earth then we know that from there you know terror comes down brother said tara comes down out of babylon comes to the city of ur he's dwelling in ur and then god speaks to abraham to separate and they he begins then tara takes them up and they move up to haran or haran i don't know exactly how to pronounce it but they begin to move up to northern mesopotamia and terror dies and abraham moves on and lot goes with him and we've got all the journeys we've talked about all that and finally in the last separation when lot separates himself out to pitch against sodom and go finally wind up in sodom abraham is there left alone with god and when god finally got abraham to a separated place god finally revealed to him the full extent of the promise it's here it's there it's here it's there now walk you in it amen and that's what abraham did and so we know that promise was to abraham to a seed and we know there comes isaac and i'm fast forwarding here isaac to jacob to the 12 princes of israel amen and we come all the way down through now they they go down at a time of famine into egypt because abraham in a time of famine went down to egypt we always think this is the first time something's happening solomon killed that he said there's nothing new under the sun what it has been before so now abraham in a time of famine went down and sojourned into egypt and then eventually abraham's presence became a curse to them in egypt and pharaoh forced him out amen when he forced him out he spoiled pharaoh and all the goods and he went out wealthy do you see the pattern now the children of israel will come down in the time of famine they will come down amen and eventually their presence becomes a curse amen to egypt and the pharaoh pharaoh forces the mount when he forces them out they go out wealthy and god now is calling them out because he he made a promise to abraham and he made that promise to abraham under separation he wanted abraham he wanted to select abraham and he wanted abraham to be separated unto him and he wanted to reveal himself to abraham so abraham became the light of his day and so now god has not forgot his promise now they're in egypt he's going to bring him out of egypt with a mighty hand but what he wants to do is he's trying to separate a nation out of a nation and he's going to separate them unto himself showing that out of the church ages he's going to bring a church out of a church he's going to bring a bride out of a church and he wants to bring that bride unto himself so first he takes them out into the wilderness separated from all other cities and all other civilizations amen because he wants there to wash them with his word and he wants to be married to them and then in the honeymoon he wants to take them to the land of canaan that he promised and he wants to positionally place them in the land and he wants the land to come under his influence completely through these people that he's chosen until the whole land that he's given to them becomes god's it is god's land but now there's a people on there that he can work through that'll purge out all the inhabitants kick out all the trash run out all the devils so that the only thing there will be the light of god this was god's plan but man has always ruined god's plan but you can see by god's plan what he wants to do so god calls him unto himself and he brings them to himself amen and they refuse him but he continues on with the plan he brings him across jordan and he says i will drive out all these inhabitants and go you now and drive them out so god is in partnership with man he's promised that he'll do the driving out but you've got to go drive them out meaning you've got to get into action and then he'll back up your action and he'll move them but when you operate by faith so so there's a couple scriptures i want to read together let's go to first chronicles i'm trying to lay a foundation for something i want to get to here chronicles 17. i never read my scriptures off my notes i look them up in my bible because it makes me slow down so that i can we can all go together first chronicles 17 20. first chronicles 17 20 o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whom god went to redeem to be his own people to make them a name of greatness and terribleness by driving out the nations from before thee thy people from whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt for thy people israel dits down make thine own people forever and thou lord become us their god so this was god's goal he wanted to make them a great nation a great people to declare his glory and brother brown tells us in the message the voice of the sign i just quoted it he said yeah there is a wonderful type that sure don't want to miss god was bringing israel's people out of a nation a nation out of a nation a nation out of a nation a beautiful type of today that god is calling his bride out of a church christian bride out of a christian church a bride church out of a church which is called the bride referred to so god is running parallels here now let's go back to exodus 34 and read another scripture exodus 34 exodus 34 and verse 10. in verse 10 and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive out before thee the amorite the canaanite the hivite the parasite and the hivite in the jebusite take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whether thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee but ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their groves for thou shalt worship no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go whoring after their gods and make thy sons go whoring after their gods thou shalt make thou shalt make the no molten image so he's bringing them into the land and he's commanding them not he's commanding them to drive out everything get it all out of the land drive out every demon every denominational idea amen every false union drive it all out and don't make any more unions with any of it because it'll trip you up he wants a total separation from all unbelief and he wants this to be a peculiar people a chosen nation and he wants to shine his light through them and let's go to deuteronomy 11. deuteronomy chapter 11. i want to read one verse there deuteronomy 11 and 24. in deuteronomy 11 24 says every place wherein the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness in lebanon from the river the river euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall be your coast so when god brought them into this land he gave them defined boundaries and in these defined boundaries he told them within you know from euphrates down to the river in egypt amen uh from here all the way into the great sea he gave them a boundary and in that boundary they were to possess all of that land and in possessing all of that land see when god was dealing with israel he was dealing with them as they were one individual he was dealing with a nation but the way he deals with the nation he was dealing with them as they were one they were one people one nation his people he was dealing them one and he was bringing them into his land and he wanted them to drive out all the inhabitants of the land and to totally purge it and bring that land subject to his word so that his light would shine from this nation that's what god wanted and god wanted that light of his gospel to shine through his people to other nations and he wanted that light to be an attractant to other nations so that other nations will come to this light israel knows this they still believe this to this day amen there's prophecies concerning this for the future but but god wanted to come and take this people purge the people and take a purged people and purge the land amen and on this land with definite boundaries he wants them to go into every corner and purge out all unbelief and get it completely gone and bring this entire land or this entire nation under the word amen so now the word of god has preeminence and when the girder god has preeminence the life of god can shine forth from this nation to other nations what he did in israel he's trying to do in you he wants to come in you and he's pulling you out of egypt and bringing you to promises of word and he's giving you boundaries and that boundary is your own life amen and he wants to drive out all unbelief amen every bit of unbelief drive out of you so that he his word takes preeminence in you and when his word takes foreign it's in you the light of god the life of god shines out from you and it becomes an attractant amen that will bring the elect to your light and you realize when god gave them commandments and got them the territory he wanted to bring everything under this territory subject to the word even by force but he never gave them permission to go outside of those boundaries and conquer another people and make them believers they were never to make converts by conquest they were make converts by light and becoming the light of the world they would draw people to the light when they come to the light they would be pointed to the source of the light which was the word of god given by god himself and then they could come in contact with the light but they were never instructed by god they were never given permission ever to go beyond these boundaries to go and conquer amen to go and conquer another nation and bring them into the faith that was forbidden because that is not god's plan but that is the denominational plan that come from nimrod that's exactly what nimrod did nimrod because he was a mighty hunter before the lord he would go and conquer a city or establish another kingdom and he would bring it subject unto babel bring a subject into this false unity and religion by force amen but god is never wanting to use force to gather his elect he is always gathering his elect by the shining of light and the elect are attracted to light and they move to light by free moral agency this is god's plan to redeem his children and he wants to use you and he wants you to possess your vessel and he wants you to drive by force out of your mind out of your conscience out of your life anything that's contrary to the word and bring this vessel of yours subject to the entire word that the word has preeminence so that he can shine light and the light is the life of men and by that light it'll attract the elect of god but never by conquest not to conquer in 1963 says christ is the mystery of god revealed and you see god himself making himself known and pulsating himself through the life that you're a prisoner to him you're his love prisoner the world can laugh make fun of them come on out you could go but you're a prisoner the other woman can act hollywood but not you you're a prisoner amen see you're a prisoner to christ other men can smoke and drink and carry on if they want to and call themselves christians deacons and even preachers but not you you're a prisoner a prisoner to the word yes sir making his mystery known to his bride tree redeemed by christ the second adam going back home to be restored back to the original eden free from death sickness sorrow shame going back with eternal life then listen so many people has got the wrong concept to convert people to christianity to its government is not god's thought at all you say we made converts to christianity by his governments that's not it well they're not supposed to drink they're not supposed to lie do you know the mohammedans can outshine you you know the heathen in africa then black men can they got laws among their tribes to outshine anything you can produce in christianity now notice god making himself known not we're not supposed to make converts to christianity by a government but by the revelation the christ in you as god was in christ and god was in christ christ in you how do you make converts not by conquest how do you make conquest by light which light his light his life christ in you the hope of glory when he is preeminence in you and that light is shining that becomes a bright and shining light amen and now the elect are attracted to the light this is how you make converts to christ by living the life of jesus christ by allowing him to have preeminence in you in your land amen he can take and possess you shine the light and bring an attracting power because the elect are attracted they're drawn to the light that's why i titled this i don't remember what title it is but conquered or drawn are you conquered or are you drawn he said no we're not supposed to make converse of christianity by a government but by the revelation the christ in you as god was in christ as god was in christ christ in you then what did what god did in christ christ does in you what signs did god in christ christ does in you oh isn't that beautiful oh my i like that jesus said at that day that's this day wake up call at that day that's this day at that day when this revelation is made known you will know that i am in the father the father and me i in you and you and me when the revelation is made manifest at day you that that day you shall know that i and the father are one i am in the father the father in me then when the revelation comes forth then it's i in you and you and me there you are that's it friends we're not to make converts listen you can't convert somebody to the message by conquering their intellect and we have tried and we have tried to conquer somebody's intellect by our biblical understanding being greater than their biblical understanding that's what the denominations are fighting over that's why they've got schools by the droves and seminaries and doctors and they write books and all that they're trying amen by force by a conquering power to conquer an intellect and they're trying that's what brother said all of them are trying to make them all baptists we're trying to make them all methods what are they trying to do they're trying to conquer my intellect and bring them into their walled city by conquest and they have to go by conquest because there's no drawing power by life when there's no drawing power by life you have to go by conquest so the tactic of the denomination the tactic of nimrod hey if nimrod's tower was so great he should have just built it and let everybody come to it and if your faith is so wonderful and your love of the mess is so great just shine the light and let the elect come to it you don't have to go on a conquest mission you don't have to go fighting for you don't have to go and debate say man you don't have to go challenging somebody and debating somebody and reasoning it out until you get somebody finally to say oh you're right i see that in the scripture that's not conversion that doesn't mean we don't compare scriptures we everything we do is based off the word amen but you can't convert somebody by governments and you can't convert somebody by being right or them acknowledging that you're right how do you convert them by christ in you that's how you bring a conversion to christianity they have to be drawn to the life of jesus christ and then introduced to jesus christ and you introduce them to jesus christ through the revealed word of the hour amen and they come into a union themselves separating from everything else uniting with christ giving him preeminence over their land then he begins to live his life through them and now they're another light set on a hill to draw men to him this is god's plan not the denominational idea let's turn to matthew 23. one thing i found is jesus is so how do i want to say this jesus is so available and so mindful of the prostitute and the tax collector in the fishermen but whenever he encounters a religious spirit he is sharp and accurate and he drills it down let's go to matthew 23 11. matthew 23 and 11 but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer you them that are entered to go in amen heaven is consistent of the word they would not let them go into the word and neither will they themselves warn to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you devour widows houses and for pretense make long prayers therefore you shall receive the greater damnation woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made you make him a twofold more child of hell than yourselves what was the pharisee doing he was trying to make a convert by governments he was trying to bring him into the law amen that's what was happening to paul paul was coming and preaching a message of grace trying to show that christ fulfilled the law and under the fulfillment of the law there was a dispensation of grace given now and what followed him judaizers that were coming right back in trying to bring the people back into a form of worship form of religion form of governments that paul was not bringing them to and so he says you hypocrites you cross the sea and the land to make a process life and all you do is make him a two-for-more child of hell because you've never brought him to god you've brought him to an order you've brought him to a system because that's what they had done amen the jews had done is they had turned the law into a systematic worship they turned it into a system that by being in the system and participating in the system now you were safe behind the wall of the system and god couldn't get you that sounds odd but that's exactly what is happening amen they're trying to build a fortification against the judgment of god so that they won't be condemned so that they can feel justified so they were crossing the sea in the land to bring them into a system amen teaching that the system was security and all they did was bring them to to be a twofold more child of hell let's keep reading woe unto you blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold they're constantly going back to their works the gold was given and now you swear by our offering and the gold was not sanctified by their offering it was sanctified by the temple but they put their works above everything else let's keep reading you'll see them and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever swears by the gift that is upon it he is guilty he fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift they're always going back to their works and putting greater emphasis on what they've done amen and not on what god has done and what god has established it wasn't their offering amen that was sanctified it was the altar that sanctified their offering it wasn't their gold that was sanctifying the giving of gold that was sanctified it was the temple that god had established amen that was what sanctified the goal was the temple not the gold and it's not by works amen there's nothing that we can do there's nothing that we do amen that'll that that'll become great amen all we do is what god does through us that's the greater works what he does through us and so you're they're always going back to a form of idolatry and you say jews and idolatry they were strictly against it you see they may not have had a statue to burn a candle to but they were idolaters because idolatry is when you begin to worship something you made with your own hands and the thing you make with your own hands you believe represents god now do you see christian idolatry now do you see how adultery crept into the christian church now the sudden they make the system of worship now the system of worship becomes the very thing that's worshipped the form or rule or system of worship becomes the thing that's worshiped because they believe that form or system of worship represents god and now by worshiping the form or the system now they are worshiping god and right with god and it's a system that they made with their own reasoning and their own intellect it's an idol of their own making that they are now worshiping and you have christians going to church reading the bible and full-blown idolatry and there's not a statute anywhere in sight because you don't need a statute to be an idolater you just need to worship something you created with your own hands believing that that something that you made represents god this is what these jews were doing when they were crossing sea and land this is what they were doing they had their system they had taken the word of god and turned it into a religious system and now the religious system became their god because when god came in flash they rejected god to keep their system they were in full-blown idolatry worshiping their own creation and rejecting a living god and today the world is in full-blown idolatry they're rejecting the living god and worshiping amen worshiping the system of their own creation believing that it represents god amen i think that's it yeah let's just keep reading because it's good jesus is very very straight verse 20 whoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth thereon and he that shall swear by heaven swearth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe the mint and anas and crewmen and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought you to have done and not leave the other undone ye blind guides would strain it and that and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup of the platter but within there full of extortion and excess thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for your likened to white sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous and you say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore you be witness unto yourselves that you are the children of them which killed the prophets which are not the children of abraham that's what he's pointing out fill you up than the measure of your fathers ye serpents you generation of vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell now that is a shocking that is a shocking uh a bit of monologue he just comes and he lays it down lays it down lays it down lays it down but you have to in that day if you if we could transport ourselves back to the day that he was saying this and the group of the people that he was talking to he was talking to the most religious the most holy the most sanctified the most set aside group of all the believers into jews he was speaking to the cream of the crop he was speaking to the best of the best and it was a shocking statement can you imagine the little prostitute is sitting there hearing what he's saying amen she could believe in her own heart well if that pharisee can't make it there's no hope for me because to her he was perfect in the eyes of other people they were the religious ones they were the spiritual ones they were the godly ones and jesus christ come and poked a hole all the way through that and his voice was exposing the fig leaves and he was leaving them naked totally exposed for the liars and hypocrites that they were they were supporting a system of their own making that they had built over generations amen and they were no longer trusting in god they were trusting in their system they were no longer worshiping god they were worshiping the system and when they were proselytizing and making converse they were making converts not to god or to his word they were making converts to their system and that's why brother branham said the baptist will bring forth a baptist the pentecostal will bring forth a pentecostal but the bride has got to bring forth a child of the word amen she cannot bring forth of her own mind her own system her understanding this bride's been impregnated she's to bring forth but she cannot bring forth another baptism another pentecost another system of thinking at all i don't care what you call it what name you put on it if it comes forth out of the system it's hybrid but the only thing she can bring forth is a child of the word [Music] that's why the word has been restored in our day but don't think that the devil's not still trying to creep around and bring nimrod's tactics right among us we have seen disaster after disaster at the disaster because we've tried to convert people by governments we tried to bring a conquest by conquering their intellectual understanding of the bible and doctrine i may have been the only one who's ever seen that but it's still the truth you'll see an attempt to bring conversion by conquest and what do you mean by conversion by conquest if i can through debate and reasoning and wisdom convince you that the doctrines of the message are right but with no real revelation from god just a mental agreement and a conceptual understanding that yeah i see the bible it looks like all that fits together yeah you must be right i have by conquest conquered your intellect and i have made a convert by conquest now that convert because he was converted by conquest or she they will be converted by the next stronger army that shows up so when they find discrepancies in the message and and people who who fell away and all of these evidences now all of a sudden your strength is not as strong as so you'll lose your subject who you conquered to a stronger army with better weapons better weapons of reasoning intellect and wisdom this is not god's method for making converts to christ then there are times when brother venom speaks about this i don't have to quote with me but he talks about a couple places there are times that if i come to you and i begin to conquer your emotions this is a dangerous one brother bram said he goes i don't like those altar calls where they get them and say now you remember john your mom you know she's in heaven now what would she think wouldn't she want you to be saved what are you doing you're conquering them emotionally amen bringing fear or emotional strings or even an emotional enthusiasm it can be any way you want but now you can begin to conquer emotionally and we can make converts by emotional conquest but those converts never stay long because emotions are so thick away man that they'll they'll come from a camp meeting or revival or a great service and they will be walking on the clouds as high as high can be amen and then the next thing you know they're in the dumps they don't even believe the message they haven't come to church for a couple of months amen what happened to them they were only emotionally conquered amen they weren't converted there was no conversion it was a conquest and the conquest won't hold when stronger emotions show up they're gone so god gave us our boundaries and he didn't say go go conquer egypt and make them jews they weren't allowed to they weren't allowed to leave this boundary amen and this boundary is the word of god and the word of god is for you as an individual and you are to bring your individual life subject to every word of god amen and within this you're allowed to use force devil get thee behind me that's a lie that's not in the word now thou evil thought leave me now i command you in the name of jesus christ by the authority he gave in the church get away from me you can by force you're allowed to go into your house and you're allowed to throw all the garbage out but i'm not allowed to go into your house because i'm only here to bring my own land subject to god's word so that he can have preeminence so i can be the light and if the light will shine there'll be a drawing power he says christ jesus said if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me but we have tried to conquer intellect and we when that didn't work we tried to conquer emotions and many times we've tried to conquer somebody's will remember it was either the sign in the head or the sign in the hand either you were convinced intellectually that it was right and supported it or you didn't even go along with it but it became so personally inconvenient it became so personally inconvenient that i'm willing to go along with it and that is why sometimes you have generational believers and families and you can see family members don't believe it all but they won't leave mom and dad they won't leave husband and wife they won't leave children they won't leave this or that they'd stay attached to the message amen because they don't necessarily believe with it but it becomes so personally inconvenient to walk away with truth cutting off relationships amen damaging to friendships damaging to relationships that all of a sudden now we're holding somebody because you can fall by a mark in the head or a mark in the hand can hold you to the system see when it comes to the system the system is not based on faith because rome didn't care what you believe even the catholic church amen i i told you before i read an article where indonesia now the government of indonesia several years back was going to require in their senses that you mark a religion you had to pick a couple religions but they had aboriginal people that were living in the jungles in indonesia and they were in ancestor worship and there was nothing on the document for them to sign so they chose christian all of these aboriginal people who lived in the jungle in a primitive way and worshiped their ancestors they picked christian because the catholic church moved in and told them that they could still worship their dead ancestors under their religion because it's not about what you believe is that true the catholic church didn't care that that pygmy believed that he could worship a dead father uncle and that those blessings coming from that he didn't care as long as that pygmy participated in the system that's all he cared about having another member swallowing them into the system uh brother jean kadema told me that in africa they did the exact same thing catholic church moved in and swept through africa because you could still be a christian and still worship ancestors because the roman system doesn't care what you believe do you understand this go all the way back to the roman system they don't care what you believe all they care about is participation that you participate in the system that's why you can have a mark in your head agreement or you don't even have to agree you have a mark in your hand you can participate so this is the foundation of the system you can believe whatever you want but as long as you participate that's nimrod nimrod never made converts to his religion he conquered them and made participants in his religion he made them participate in his religion they could disbelieve it all they want amen it wasn't about whether they believed it or not as long as they participated they were saved if they didn't participate they were dead nebuchadnezzar picks up this same spirit amen when he brings the jews in he doesn't mind that the jews worship jehovah nebuchadnezzar never tried to stop them from worshiping jehovah but when he made an image he required that all bowed down to this image and this is now you can keep believing in jehovah he's not asking them to drop their jewish faith he's asking them to participate in the system of religion and when they refuse to participate now he's got to kill them listen we're breaking down religion at its core the threat to religion is non-participation because they don't care what you believe they care if you participate or not do you come to church do you pay your tithes do you dress right talk right walk right right but what about are you converted are you converted have you met jesus christ have you been conquered or have you been drawn nimrod didn't care what you believed but he forced your participation in the world council churches they don't care what you believe only care about your participation the catholic church doesn't care what you believe they're worried about your participation the baptist church does not care what you believe as long as you participate and participation brings a unity think about this participation brings a unity and a unity brings a false sense of security so now the threat to religion because religion is all about keeping man from god creating a barrier or wall to keep man separated from god so now the religion all that they care about is participate this is the spirit behind i don't care what anybody says or what church you go to it doesn't matter it'll show up in all kinds of forms and rituals and rules and conduct an order that you can think of a million different ways i'm not worried about it i'm coming down to the very spirit of it at its core which we saw in cain we saw nimrod we saw nebuchadnezzar we saw in rome it comes down to the same thing the threat to religion becomes non-participation because participation brings unity and unity brings a false security that's the same thing will happen under this world council of churches amen participation brings a unity unity brings a sense of security self-preservation self-protection and now any voice against that becomes a threat and now that voice against that one of two things have to happen they either have to drive them out leave us go away from us or kill them there's the and i'm talking religion now please listen spiritual religion you have to either drive them out or kill them but today they can't take you out and shoot you or stone you so they kill your influence they drive you out amen and they say things about you like you're not even a message believer if you believe that way do you see the system they have to drive you out or kill you that's why nebuchadnezzar had a problem when these three it's not that nebuchadnezzar was mad at these three he loved him he gave him a second chance they were wise with his kingdom they were they were in positions of power and authority and the court of nebuchadnezer amen it's not that he wanted to go darius did not want to throw daniel into the lion's den but he was trapped in his own system and non-participation was the problem because darius knew who daniel's god was he knew that daniel prayed to that god and darius had no problem with it amen but they brought darius around amen they said let's exalt you in the system amen and now with a systematic approach amen now he made a new law and now the problem was not that daniel prayed jehovah the problem was that daniel was not participating because darius did not care that daniel prayed to jehovah do you believe that the problem is non-participation see you can believe what you want and you can have no faith and not even be converted but if you pay your tithe and dress right and come every sunday then you're all right then you're okay now the system is protecting you from the judgment of the word because you do what we fundamentally believe in to be true and you participate now we're going to protect you because participation brings unity unity brings a false sense of security and any voice against it has to be excommunicated or killed this is the system friends and the system is all around us trying to get in we've brought a systematic approach sometimes to saving our children we bring our children into the system of obeying everything which is what we have to do because joshua said as for me and my house we will serve the lord your children in your house there's you have to bring that under dominion of the word you have no choice but if your children aren't converted they're not okay they can dress the way a believer ought to dress they can come to church they can raise their hands and pray but if they're not converted they're not okay just because they participate don't make participation in a message church the same as conversion we have people who've lost their children to the world and there's all kinds of reasons why we lose our children to the world but they'll come back if they saw a light because we don't convert by governments we convert by christ in you they may go and that may be what they need to go so that they cannot feel comfortable in the system anymore but they have to recognize where the light and life was so that they can come to the light on their own children have gone there's many many reasons for why they go but sometimes we get so confused when we say i took them to every camp i could get them to we were always in church i played the tapes in the house and we believe that somehow because we got them to participate in all that for 18 19 20 years that they were converted that's not equal to conversion that's participation and participation can bring a false sense of security so we get surprised when they go away but the truth is they weren't converted and all the participation in the world amen sometimes when we try to get our kids converted we do extra participation is that true it's a denominational mentality because they're converted by coming under the token and the token is the life of christ on display in your home and sometimes i wonder if we're not trying to overcompensate for no christ life in the house and try because there's no christ light in the house now we're trying to bring a participation and participation will become security for our kids because it doesn't matter how much you participate if they see an antichrist spirit at home what's an antichrist spirit anti-word i thought brother ben said i know but i think that's his opinion and we're going to do this you can get people to participate in the system that's not hard there's only one way to get somebody converted and that's christ in you and if you have christ in you then brother benham said have confidence in your token that you can apply the token and that token will take effect not extra participation but token life on display will bring the conversion not additional participation you don't get bonus points there's not extra exposure do you understand we almost act like it's like getting chicken pox the more we get together more we get together more get together the more chance you have of catching it i hope you understand my heart i'm not trying to discourage one person i'm trying to bring it back to the word amen and your our children everybody around us has to see the literal life of jesus christ in display that our territory our land has been brought subject to the word and from that there's a light that's shining so that our children are not conquered by the system but they're drawn by the life they are drawn to the light and that light in life is your token and that's the thing that you put on display but that's also the thing you have in confidence amen when you're praying for your children you say lord i know that that token was on display i know your life is in me it's not that we lived perfect we didn't live perfect but god i know that you're in me and i've got confidence that that token will have an effect on my children may look bad it may be sideways upside down and backwards it doesn't matter amen amen if they've ever seen the life amen they can never forget where that light is and the elect are attracted to the light brother chad you're against participation oh my goodness i'm preaching on a sunday morning am i against participation but it's a product an outcropping of faith it's not a security that's based on participation it's a security based on revelation and the revelation produces an outcropping of participation it's a razor's edge should we never get together should we stop doing news meetings you understand the real issue that we face is the devil will try to bring the message into another system another form of group participation that brings a unity that brings a false security where will he try to do it he'll try to do it right here he'll try to do it in this church he'll try to do it in your house he'll try to do it in your mind there's no point looking anywhere else the problems all around us what are we fighting against we're fighting against systematic religion spirits that are trying to get the bride off course but god has sent a word this day to take the veil off of that thing and say that's wrong we don't make converts by this that or the other we make converts by christ in you what god did in christ christ does in you that's it right there it's the life if you've got somebody in your heart you want to get converted keep living the life we've had people on our minds that we try to get converted i've done this before i can speak from experience somebody i'm burdened for just really had a burden for and i really wanted to get them converted so what i did was had a bible study and what my bible study really was was not an exalting of the word it was a conquering by doctrine so i'm not talking about anybody else i'm talking about me you can have a bible study that's absolutely correct because it's exalting the word and every the elect is attracted to the light of the age or we can sit down and under debate and intellectualism i can try to conquer your doctrine and you know what those two conversations can sound exactly the same it's the motive behind it that's the problem it's not the action it's the motive it's the spirit that motivates it's what we're trying to do if israel would just have fully surrendered and drove out all the inhabitants of the land if they would have just pushed out all the unbelief and allowed their god to be their king and bring all the territory subject to the word of god the people in the nations would have been attracted by droves would be coming to find out what was going on there what they should have done is bring their territory subject not try to conquer somebody else or not try to settle down and just have peace and stop driving out enemies they failed by them john 3 19 says and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved that's why we have to shine a light the light exposes the deeds of darkness but man wants to be religious and he wants to be a christian he wants to be a believer so he'll find a system i want to look at one more story and then we'll wind down and close let's go to first kings i just want to show a demonstration of what i'm trying to express first kings chapter 10. first kings chapter 10 and verse 1. and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions brother branham calls the reign of solomon in the beginning of his reign the golden age of israel they had secured borders they had chopped down the groves they they had run everything out and brought everything into subjection they had built under solomon they had built the temple amen they have the priesthood established the temple worship established they've come into their golden age they're shining light and when the queen of sheba heard of the famous solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bear spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart and solomon told her all her questions there was not anything hid from the king which he told or not and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon's wisdom in the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendants of his men what he done he had brought everything under subjection in the attendance at his tables of his ministers and their apparel and the cup holders and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord his approach to god there was no more spirit in her and she said to the king it was true report that i heard in my own land of thy acts and in my wisdom how being i believe not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard happy are thy men happy are those that thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord thy god which delighteth in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord hath loved israel forever therefore made he the king to do judgment and justice she traveled a long ways solomon never went down into southern arabia and conquered that nation to make the queen of sheba a convert solomon actually never conquered amen to bring proselytes into israel he drove out every force and demolished every threat against israel and brought israel into the worship of jehovah and that was their golden age and under the golden age amen from far away without him going to convince to conquer to play emotional games all solomon did was keep subjecting to the word of god to the word of god to the word of god to the word of god and his fame was going out he was shining a light and this queen of sheba from far away which they believe is down near yemen somewhere queen of sheba traveled all this way across the desert to hear and when she saw when she heard the words and she saw the wisdom and she saw the order that everything was in there was no more heart left in her she knew that this was true because we don't make converts by governments we make converts by christ in you what can i do to win my children christ in you what can i do to win my family members christ in you what can i do what can i do to win my my neighbors or my co-workers christ in you you don't make converts by governments you don't go out and conquer them amen you conquer self amen you put self-will down you conquer your own reasonings your own wisdom your own end to life conquer this territory and drive out all unbelief how's that going to save my children because when christ is on display and the tokens on display then you can have confidence in that token to take effect for your children not your works not your efforts not the token brotherhood and say apply the token and then sit them down and have a good long talk with them and make them see that this is true and lock the door and don't even let them go out you apply the token with confidence that will take effect and the next time you go to talk to them say lord help me i'm going to talk to my son let me get them i claim them in jesus name let the token life take effect if you're attracting if the goal of a religious system is to attract more numbers you don't care if you get goat or sheep because all you want to do is fill the seeds so you don't really care what they believe or who they are if they're converted the only thing that you require to fill your seats is that they participate in your system and i don't care what religious system it is you attach any name you want to it it plays by the same rules a liberal church a legalist church all churches in between they all play by the same rules because it's a religious spirit that they're all motivated by if you just want to fill seats then you don't it doesn't matter conversions are not the problem amen conquering to your system you want to convert not to christ but convert to the system so when you convert to the system now you can get anything but if you're not trying to fill one seat if you don't care whether one more goes in or one leaves or whatever as long as christ is exalted as long as the light is shining as long as the true word is being lifted up amen you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that my sheep hear my voice another than not follow if it's the voice of the of the shepherd the sheep will come we're not interested in attracting people we're not interested in making converts we're not interested in conquering anything except us he says when i be lifted up jesus when he was here he says i am the light of the world he looked at his disciples before he departed and says ye are the light of the world just shine the light we're not here to make converts by conquest but by christ in you god has never violated free moral agency he's got ways of making free more latency work out but god put man on the basis of free choice and he didn't put the church here to overcome and conquer that he just said shine the light lift up christ if i be lifted up all men will come he says it's got to come down to the line of free moral agency yourself let the word of god you don't come because your mother was a good woman you don't come because you're a good neighbor you come because that god calls you to come and you accept him on the basis of his word that word is what means everything that word if you can get everything out of the way all conscience all senses and just let the word come in that word will produce just exactly in revelation chapter 4 he says how did it self-will why would you call that self-will brother branham because it puts a man and a woman back again just like adam and eve at the garden of eden on what the two trees self-will this one is death this one is life self-will free moral agency god placed the first man adam and eve right here on free moral agency he places you the same place and the only way that you can get this thing fixed in there is your self-will your own self-will hallelujah your self-will you have to will to do god's will you have to get rid of your own will to let god's will come in for this is the only channel that leads to the heart by your own self-will you lay down your life i want to read two passages of scriptures and we'll close first peter turn to first peter chapter two oh my there's so much first peter chapter 2. first peter chapter 2 verse 9. but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past we're not a people but are now the people of god this is exactly how he spoke to israel when he brought them out of egypt this is now the bride which in time past were not of people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but have now obtained mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstained from fleshly lust which war against the soul have your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evil doers they may be they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation turn over to isaiah 60. isaiah 60 and verse 1. we're speaking here of the bride in the end time it says arise shine for thy light has come that's our commandment arise and shine the sun is up this is a commandment arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee that is what's happened to the bride in this end time for behold the darkness shall cover the earth in gross darkness to people is that true is that this day but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light you don't have to conquer anything the gentiles shall come to thy light and the kings to the brightness of thy rising lift up thine eyes round about and see all the they gather themselves together they come to thee the sun shall come from afar thy daughter shall be nursed at thy side then thou shalt see and flow together and thine heart shall fear and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee the multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of the midian and ephah all the from sheba shall come they shall bring gold and incense and they shall show forth the praises of the lord all the flocks of keto shall be gathered together all the flocks of keto shall be gathered together and the rams of naropath shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar and i will glorify the house i shall glorify thy house of my the house of my glory who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to their window surely the isle shall wait for me and the ships of tarshish first to bring thy sons from afar their silver their gold with them unto the name of the lord thy god and to the holy one of israel because he hath glorified thee and the sons of strangers shall build up the walls and their kings shall minister unto thee for in my wrath i smote thee but in my favor have i had mercy on thee therefore thy gate shall be opened continually they shall not be shut day nor night that men may bring unto thee the forces of the gentiles and that their kings may be brought for the nation and thy kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish yea those nations shall be utterly waste the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee the fur tree the pine tree the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and i will make the place of my feet glorious the sons also of them that that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee and all they that despise thee shall bow themselves down at the souls of thy feet and they shall call thee the city of the lord the zion of the holy one of israel when you read that we know prophecy has a dual meaning a natural meaning to israel but a spiritual meaning to the bride and many much of that language also ties into new jerusalem the heavenly city which is mount zion the holy one which is the bride and god in this day in a day of gross darkness he says arise and shine arise and shine for your light has come the glory of the lord shall be found upon thee the glory lord shall shine upon thee and what shall he do he shall gather all things together because in the end time amen there's going to be a new jerusalem that comes down and everything shall come into that city and the door shall never be closed at night and now there is a drawing power to wherever christ is wherever that light is it emanates out of that city and christ is the temple thereof the lamb is the templar of the the light of the lord is shining through this city and out of this city it's drawing all men into the city and god we are the dwelling place the habitation the temple of the lord and god wanted to establish an israel a place in jerusalem a place where now in the millennium he's going to set jesus christ on the throne and when jesus christ is on the throne there will be a light that emanates over the whole earth under his kingdom and there will be a drawing power from that light that will draw to jerusalem and in this day there's been a great light there's been the life of jesus christ returning back to the church and now in his holy abode in the temple in the habitation your lively stones built into a spiritual house in this new jerusalem now he's shining out and the light is the attraction the life is the attraction the light of the word the life of the word jesus christ himself on display in a mini-men and bobber many many member body is now the attraction to jesus christ we are not to make converts like nimrod we are to take what jesus said if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me this is not a religion it's a life this is not a system it's a true worship it's not a form although there's form brother man taught us form to our services he dot us conduct and order but it's not that that's not the thing those are outcroppings of our faith all of that never will produce faith those are outcroppings of faith but it's not a form it's not a church it's not an altar it's not a sincerity sincerity it's the revelation of the word and it's the life of that word on display that's drawing all men i i pray that you understand my heart and the things i say i'm not against anybody these things corrected me i've tried to convert by force i've tried to convince my intellect especially when i first come to the message i had some knock down drag out arguments over the word and my approach was not shining the light of christ but god wants not your intellect not your wisdom but your surrender nimrod had the power the physical force and power to unify the world and bring them all to one religion is that true and if god wanted that he would have anointed nimrod and he would have worked through nimrod but what did god do he went and got one man that come out of that system and he got abraham he pulled him off to the side guys separated from everything else he said now i give you the land and now he was shining his light through abraham and guess what abraham had an allegiance with some friends and he had trained soldiers who could fight and destroy five kings is that true but abraham used that force to deliver lot in sodom and the cities that around the bound but he never used that force to produce the promise of the word because god wasn't looking for abraham's strength he was looking for abraham's surrender when god come to drive the inhabitants off the land and set up his his nation in the set up his uh nation upon the earth and israel he didn't go get the amorites he didn't go get uh another kingdom the egyptians or some other strong army what he got is he pulled a bunch of slaves out of egypt because he didn't want anything to be conquered by strength he didn't want anything to be overcome by power or force so he took something that had no power no force and he drew it out and he raised it up and he sent it in and that's why he said i'll drive out the inhabitants they weren't even soldiers they were slaves because god does not want us by strength intellect wisdom ability to expand his kingdom he wants us to come by humility and surrender and by humility and surrender and abasing ourselves he will exalt us and when he lifts us up he lifts us up by the word and now it becomes the word on display and god wanted to attract by the light of the word and so now the greatest thing that we can do for the lost world around us is make a full surrender to god to give ourselves holy to this word and let by preeminence him come and live in us that's the only way to convert the world around us is by christ in you the hope of glory let's all stand musicians if you'll come i appreciate you being patient with me and loving me as i unburden my heart you know the gospel is simple sometimes we make it so hard the gospel is simple he's coming for you he's got lost sheep and he's coming for you and how does he call the sheep by his voice because my sheep hear my voice they see the light they hear the voice they come to it that's the gospel that's conversion that's calling the elect we don't need a formal this we don't need a system we don't need to convert by force all we got to do is keep lifting christ on high keep letting the voice of the shepherd go out keep letting the light shine and the elect will come the sheep will come the elect will come we don't have to worry about it we don't want to get sucked in to wrong methods and false methods that don't produce the life there's one thing that produces the life and that's the life the life produces the life and the bride is only to bring
