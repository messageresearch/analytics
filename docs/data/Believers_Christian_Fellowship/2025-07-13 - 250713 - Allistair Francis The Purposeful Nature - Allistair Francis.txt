[Music] Heavenly Father, how wonderful it is to be in your presence with saints of light, precious faith. Lord, worshiping before your holy name. Your name is our identification. Your name is our strength in this time. Your bride is the group of people that know the true name of the Lord in this day. And we have the authority by that name to speak the word in this time. Lord, we receive your word. We worship you through it. Lord, you have revealed the secrets of the universe to us. You have revealed your purpose and your plan for the ages for of time. You have revealed all things to us, Lord, through the name of God revealed in these last days. How thankful we are, Lord, that we are your people. How grateful we are, Lord, for your revelation that you have sent in this day. We can never thank you enough, Father God, for the blood of Calvary, for washing our sin away, for bringing us true repentance by your word, and so much more, Lord, for the word that you sent by a humble prophet in this last day, Lord. He spoke amidst great persecution and turmoil and trouble. And even to this day, they are blackening his reputation and speaking against the word that was spoken. Yet he spoke with zeal and fervor and great inspiration, not even knowing those who had come and received that word. He didn't even know us. He didn't even know who we would be and what our lives would be, Lord. But you put your spirit within him to speak the message, Lord, that has drawn us from all corners of the earth and brought us together and made us a family and made us friends, made us benefit from one another and given us joy and peace in our lives and transformed our families and took us out of the mess of this world. What a privilege it is, Lord. We are so thankful for the blood of Calvary and the message of the hour. Our lives are meaningless and empty without it, oh God. And we give you all the praise and the glory and the honor for it. Lord, we welcome you among us this morning. Lord, may you bless us today with your word. I'm just mortal man full of faults and failures and full of my own thoughts. Lord, I I ask you that you would purge my mind of all my own thoughts that your thoughts may be expressed to your people today. Bless the pastor and the people of this congregation. May this time that we spend together, Lord, be one step closer to that glorious translation, that glorious body change which this creature is groaning for. Father God, may you undertake for every need. Lord, we have a great task today. We have a a world that is teetering on the edge of destruction. People are succumbing to madness and strife and it looks like everything around us is they're losing their minds. They don't know what is reality anymore. It is becoming more and more difficult to get through to the spirit of man to change his mind about something to to let them see what reality and truth is. And yet in this time you have placed us Lord with your word. What can we do? What can we say? What can we teach that is so convincing that can permeate the hardened spirit of man? How can we change liberal and legal people, Lord, who have made up their minds about life and about marriage and about family and about politics and about God, about whether you exist or not? How can we change them? How can we affect them? Is our purpose, Lord, just to be a church that just keeps going on and on having services and song specials and song services and prayer meetings or is there something more that you want us to do? Is there something more that you have called us for? Is there something more that our lives are meant to achieve? Lord, we bring ourselves to you today willing to be instructed, willing to be taught, willing to be corrected, willing to be anointed of you. Lord God, we pray that you may bless all your children gathering in the different churches today in this country. All waiting to hear from you. all wanting to hear one word of life from you. We pray that you may anoint your bride this morning. Bless all the saints. Bless the saints back home in Durban, South Africa. Lord Jesus, may you be with our people as well. Father, we are truly thankful for you this this day and we ask you to be with us. Open up the scriptures to us. Open up your word. Lord, without your spirit we cannot understand anything and we depend upon you in all things. As we worship you now and submit and our souls bowing down before you, we welcome you among us. Speak, Lord, for we are willing to listen. We ask it in your precious name with thanksgiving and praise. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We like to greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It's certainly good to be with you. I think that's what I was looking for. And um you may take your seats for a few minutes before we read the word of God. I just want to make sure I say all the relevant things. So, I just uh am so grateful to God to have this uh opportunity to be here with you once again and to uh share the word of God with you as he has um uh inspired us. You know, we we don't have anything new to say. Uh but we have something that God places on our heart that we can share with every one of you. And I know that each one of us has something to share. And that's why we're here today uh in this world in 2025. And God has anointed us. God has given us uh uh his word. He has anointed us with his spirit. He has given us revelation and understanding and uh we have a responsibility to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I just once again just happy to be here with you and good to see all of you again. I'm I'm thankful. Brother Chad told me, "You know what? You're part of the furniture now, so there's no need for me to come before you." And I appreciate that. Makes me feel so much better. Amen. So, I see a few years ago, it was 2022, I looked at the audience and I could just see faces I I didn't know. Now, it's all just friends. Amen. And I really certainly appreciate you. You know, it's uh it's always easier to preach to people who um know the word of God, who are well taught, people who are hungry for the word and um and I certainly appreciate your spirit and the worship uh always. It's really a blessing to me and I appreciate your pastor. He is a he's an inspiration uh not just to me but many people around the world and it's a it's a difficult time as I was praying there are many people in need people in the message um people u facing different trials you you you may not realize it um I must say Lima is a little bit of a utopia um I I mean if you come and live in our city. It's uh it's completely different. It's it's a rat race. It's uh so busy. The houses are all squashed nearby and uh you know it's there's crime. Uh here it looks like heaven. You're just driving through things are so peaceful. You know it's like I struggle to to find out how you people have desperation for the rapture. So, it's so calm. It's so peaceful. Time just goes by slowly. Uh, and the sun sets so late. You don't even know it's 9:00, it's 10:00, what's happening? And, uh, but with us, uh, even the birds remind us, go to sleep now. You know, it's, um, it's a different terrain and, uh, different, uh, places have different struggles and trials. I understand. And so, um, when I when I come here, it's it's always so relaxing and I certainly appreciate everything that you do. Um, so yeah, we appreciate the ministry here and all our friends and uh, and I consider you the family of God. So, the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want to um, let you stand again as we just read the word of God. Just want to make sure I I'm getting it right. Yeah. We're going to read from Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 8. Says, "The Holy Ghost, this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was yet standing." I'll read it again. the Holy Ghost. This signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest. While as the first tabernacle was yet standing, did you ever think that that's what the Holy Ghost was signifying? &gt;&gt; That the way into the holiest, Did the Holy Ghost make it known to us that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest? &gt;&gt; Amen. while as the first tabernacle was yet standing. In other words, it's telling us and it's pointing to that that the Holy Ghost that came in our day, it was actual proof to us that before the Holy Ghost came, there was no way into the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That tells us what the Holy Ghost truthfully is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, this is might terrify some of you for a little bit. I am going to take a subject called the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost. Hold that thought. Let it digest and we're going to get through it. And for a title, the purposeful nature. Amen. So when we read this scripture, uh Paul tells us that the Holy Ghost coming after Christ proved to us that while the tabernacle of Moses was still in operation, the way into the holiest of holies was not yet revealed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not made known. There was no access. So the reason for me preaching um this subject this morning, you know, coming here, I tussled with it. I struggled with it right up to last night. I was should I shouldn't I, you know, and and struggling through it and putting things in the right places, but I just couldn't get it out of me because I I've I've preached certain things uh in the recent years and I spoke about in different places. I spoke about the Holy Ghost, the types of the Holy Ghost when they came out of Egypt and the type of the Holy Ghost when they went into the promised land and how there was a an infancy baptism and then a mature baptism and the rolling away the reproach of of Egypt at Gilgal and showing the difference between the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Pentecost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost under the seventh seal. And uh it you know I just expected people to say amen. We get that. And it seems like when you touch the Holy Ghost, it's a very sensitive spot for people. And um my main uh concern, well, you know, I say that it's my main concern. I mean, but who am I? I just feel like the Lord is feeling what is in the hearts of the people. And that's probably why it feels like it's my concern, you know. So I I keep hearing questions from the young people and as of lately from older people who I would have considered to have known where they stand uh saying, "Brother Alistister, how do I know I have the Holy Ghost? um how do I know whether you know whether I have the Holy Ghost from Pentecost or whe I had the Holy Ghost under the seventh seal? What am I supposed to be doing? Is there a difference? Am I supposed to be acting different? And so to me that is what I feel is something that should be um made clear and I I really care about the young people and I believe they are the church of tomorrow, the next generation. I also believe that when the word says we must keep his commandments, the word keep means to preserve, which means to pass it on. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how you preserve it. You make sure it goes to the next generation that it continues. Keep it for a perpetual covenant from for your children and your children's children and so on. So it really fails us if we become people who take an idea of the Holy Ghost given to us by Pentecost and then pass that down to our children and then we see it's ineffective. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then what happens is our children meet people, they go to youth camps, they go to youth meetings and we find there's this tradition of trying to force young people to get something &gt;&gt; and they leave more confused. or they keep coming back and they are forced to be doing the same thing again and again. &gt;&gt; And uh I feel like being the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ there needs we need to be the people with direction &gt;&gt; with understanding. We need to be the people who can have a solid foundation to say this is what it is. &gt;&gt; And I'm not afraid to say what it is. And I'm I'm not hindered by somebody trying to make me feel inferior or somebody trying to make me feel like I don't know what I have. And so that is the reason why it's so impressing on me to make this clear to the bride of Christ and to let us know because this is something so personal to us. The Holy Spirit is something so personal to us. When you understand who he is, what it is, you wouldn't you wouldn't want to live a second without him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, knowing this that the Holy Ghost signified that before Christ, the way to God was not made manifest. Well, that's simply telling us something important. The Holy Ghost has made the way possible. &gt;&gt; Right? That's the first thing we need to know. &gt;&gt; To do what? Right? So, knowing this and that it made the way possible, it sparks so many questions. Questions that stem from the things we were previously taught of the Holy Ghost and things we have been uh we have heard since we came into the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I believe that uh the trouble in this subject can can come simply from trying to make sense of the scriptures and the message and it's like if you've got these scriptures and the statements brother Baron makes in the message like you got these uh uh the one quote way it says the dynamics is the Holy Spirit and look where that went to &gt;&gt; right the mechanics is this and the dynamics is the Holy Spirit and people took that and started teaching things and it expanded handed into people trying to express what they thought the dynamics is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I believe that the trouble comes from trying to make sense of the scriptures and the message and the statements. Well, that's the trouble with almost any subject. &gt;&gt; Right? So we know that the prophet says that God interprets his own word. Now listen to the story. You know that, right? God is an interpreter of his own word. And there's an understanding to be had with this, &gt;&gt; right? Does this mean that we have nothing to say? That I'm just somebody who stands here and and like some supernatural being takes over me and God interprets his word like I'm not even conscious of what I'm saying or that these hand gestures that I keep doing are him controlling me that he interprets his own word. No, he interprets his word within us. And here's the amazing thing that the scripture says that in the mouth of two or three, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; let it be established. &gt;&gt; Why would he even do that? And it always worked that way. You you know the scripture that says where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in their midst. &gt;&gt; You know what that means, right? That doesn't mean just because more than three are here that God is here. There are many people who are gathering in the name of Jesus Christ and God is not there. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not what it means. That scripture specifically means that anything is established as long as two or three in with the spirit of God agree on it &gt;&gt; right from the law right through. That's what it means. Let u by by the witness of two or three, let it be established. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, why would he do that? &gt;&gt; Why would there have to be two or three? What's wrong with just having one person who has the Holy Ghost say something and because the Holy Ghost said it, let it be established. &gt;&gt; Because to people there needs to be a witness of two or three to see that they are seeing the same thing. Therefore, they can believe it. &gt;&gt; And that in itself is showing us that it is not a foolproof way. Foolproof, terrible word, right? man can men can so easily get people to follow their own interpretation. So if let's look at this way. If two or three people agree on the wrong thing &gt;&gt; and say they have the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; then because the church has manipulated that law, &gt;&gt; it's established. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This is why I say it isn't foolproof. And yet God instituted it that way. &gt;&gt; Right? So the way it works is if a man has the Holy Ghost, then he has the witness in himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. that the word spoken by the preacher was interpreted by God or not. Which then happens to you when you hear the preacher speaking, you have a witness in yourself and you hear that word and you decide based on what he's telling you to say amen or not. &gt;&gt; Right? So the Holy Ghost then settles the word in that man and makes him say amen to the to the confirming of the interpretation of the word. That is God being his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Right. Not &gt;&gt; and this is why we get so uh criticized when we say something because some people are going to doubt now. Is he saying that with the Holy Spirit? Is he interpreting that by himself? Is it his own thoughts, own interpretation? The only way it can be established is if you have the Holy Spirit and you can say amen to that. And then when there's more than one that have the Holy Spirit that say amen to it, then what was said is established. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If a man does not have the Holy Ghost, it will be the opposite. Or he may choose to believe it and say amen based on his understanding because he's saying amen because it's a church tradition and he says amen because it makes sense to him, not necessarily that the Holy Spirit confirmed that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you see how precarious this is? &gt;&gt; How dangerous it is and how this has been passed down for generations? People saying amen because it makes sense. People saying amen because they like it. People say amen because it's convenient. But there needs to be this is the purpose or the reason why it's crucial that we all have the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; because then things can actually be established &gt;&gt; properly established. &gt;&gt; Amen. So true believers have to stay as true to the word as they can. And that's what we're coming to in this little subject. And we've got to believe that God will interpret his word within them. We literally walk around by faith. I greet you. I shake your hand. You shake my hand. You say, "God bless you, brother." We fellowship together. Sometimes we fellowship together to test each other, right? You know, are we on the same page? Do we have the same spirit? We're testing each other all the time. But it it makes fellowship so sweet, so beautiful when our spirits connect. &gt;&gt; Do you know that um you are first a spiritual being before you are a natural? So like when you're walking towards somebody and uh before they even speak a word, before you shake hands, you already your spirits have already connected. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As he's coming towards say, "Oh, he's having a bad day." You already know you he's not happy to see me right now. He'd rather not be here. And then you shake hands and you both say, "God bless you, brother, but your spirits are already connected &gt;&gt; and already communicated and your body's just acting out something for the sake of peace or something." But this is this is exactly what happened. So without the Holy Spirit between two people, there can never really be peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the other thing. It is the peace of God. &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's move on. So, when we look at the scriptures on the Holy Ghost, as we approach the subject, we must realize that we are stepping into dangerous territory. I like dangerous territory because I like that God can lead us through it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm not afraid of it, especially in a day like this. But the carefulness that is needed is where we need the guide, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit. We also have to bear in mind that you know when we are speaking of this you know peoples of the world have been delving into this mystery long before any of us were born right we literally are Johnny come lately no offense to any Johnny's around &gt;&gt; right but we are literally I I didn't make up these phrases brother Johnny that's what they call did Johnny come lately we have just arrived yet there are people who have lived through the the the seven church ages, the time when the Holy Ghost poured out. Before that, there were the the great prophets and sages and they lived through this time. They studied it. They asked the questions. They wrote things. We've we are we are arriving here and piggybacking of what those people have been through. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and sometimes it's so, you know, amazing for me when I when I listen to ministers who who stand there so aggressively saying this is what it is and there's no other way but the way I have said it and yet there are thousands of generations of people who brought it up for you to receive it today. &gt;&gt; Let's be cognizant of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; So most ancient religions have believed in the spirit of God. Do you know that? &gt;&gt; And they believe the spirit of God is invisible like the wind. &gt;&gt; Right? Some people believe the wind when it blows is the breath of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the beliefs come from watching babies being born. Why? Because a baby's born and he's struggling. And as soon as the breath comes in, they believe &gt;&gt; the breath of God has given him life. And so they literally believe it's breath, right? And people dying breathe their last breath and the and and the life is gone. And how babies suck in their first breath and how a dying person exhales the last one. Most religious people believe that it is the Holy Ghost in the person's spirit given by God entering or exiting the body. I think I might have told you before it leads to all kinds of things like when people sneeze and the old English traditions where the you know the spirit comes out and that's why you say bless you because the enemy can catch and then comes back in &gt;&gt; right you know that &gt;&gt; gaze &gt;&gt; bless you good health gaze in the German uh so now by uh us understanding what the holy spirit is we can put aside all the confusion about this, right? Because it's it's more than that. &gt;&gt; It signifies the entering into the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; So all scriptures like and think of it, you say, "Okay, brother, th those are you know those are the religions of of other or beliefs of other religions. But what about us? What about Christianity? What about the Jews?" Yes, the Jews as well, right? You know from the scriptures, God blew into Adam's nostrils, the breath of life and man became a living soul or the Lord Jesus blowing on them and they receiving the Holy Ghost, right? And so I don't know if you've ever seen I had a cousin in South Africa. Uh I probably have a cousin. I haven't heard of her in a while. But they uh um they were in the they were denominational and in the Benihinn meetings that came into South Africa. And so Beni Hinn had this thing, you know, he would he the choir would be there and people would be there and he would go and they'd all fall down &gt;&gt; or wave his coat and they all fall down and would tell me he's so anointed, you know. But of course we know what it is. the first person falls down and pushes all the others, but they feel it's powerful &gt;&gt; and he's he his breath he's blowing. And then you'd have these fellows like Kenneth Hagen and these men would would uh walk through the crowds and blow on people and they just fall down or they start laughing hysterically, right? You probably seen more of that than I have. Um but this is where all these things come from because Christ blew on them and they received the Holy Ghost. Well, then we can blow on people and they receive the Holy Ghost. But we've never seen the prophet of the hour do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can see how then these scriptures are so misinterpreted. &gt;&gt; And be careful people when you start seeing people in the message start taking on these dangerous things that have got zero to do with what the Holy Ghost really is. &gt;&gt; Amen. So by that statement you can gather that it is important to understand that the understand the godhead to fully understand the Holy Ghost. We will incorporate this into what we're going to be touching on today. Blowing upon people no that's not it. That's not what brings the Holy Ghost. So probably the most important answer on the Holy Ghost that people are looking for today is brother how are we supposed to receive it? Right? And the other question um that people are asking and looking for an answer is how do I know that I have it? Right? So many people don't want to spend the time knowing what it is. They just want to get it and be done with it and receive all the benefits and proceed further. Right? And it doesn't work like that. Then many people have convinced themselves that they have it based that I have the Holy Ghost, brother. I know I have the Holy Ghost. And how do you know? Because I had an experience. &gt;&gt; You've heard that too. &gt;&gt; And uh then later things happen and then they doubt whether they had the experience. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or what experience it was. So let's consider what the prophet says and to me this is my favorite quote on the Holy Ghost on receiving the Holy Ghost. Uh I remember as a young minister this I I don't know how many colors I I uh uh mocked this with and memorized it and every time I spoke about it this is the most important one. It's on I think it's page six paragraph 22. Are you with us? Amen. &gt;&gt; Upon this place we wish to approach the subject which I think is the outstanding subject of today of the what is the Holy Spirit? What is it? And now the reason I've taken the subject in line like this you cannot come are you listening? You cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is. &gt;&gt; First requirement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you cannot receive it if you know what it is. unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you. &gt;&gt; And then number three, you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is my favorite statement. So if you know what it is and who it's to and what action it brings when it comes, then you know what you've got when you get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is. That's just would settle it. And it's like, it's like the prophet says, it's like, "Yeah, now we can close up and go home." Right? If you know what it is, you believe it's given to you and it's for you, and you know what results it brings, then you know what you've got when you get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need to break that downise. And of course, the problem is when people believe uh and today when it's taught to people that this is what the Holy Ghost is, they teach what it was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then the results they want is what it used to bring. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are going to base this entire study on this little bit of advice from the prophet. What is the Holy Ghost? Believe that it's given for me. believe that it's for me. This is a very important state that it's for me. I am not Peter from 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; I'm not a fisherman. &gt;&gt; I'm not someone who doesn't have the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, what is it for me? &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you want to really get a full understanding, you have to explore the scriptures and the message to fulfill these four things. I just want to highlight some important things. Do you love the scripture? &gt;&gt; Do you love Bible study? &gt;&gt; I love it. It's like, you know, I rub my hands together, settle myself in my seat, and start enjoying it and gets the gastric juices flowing and &gt;&gt; digestion and everything happening. Amen. Spiritually, of course. So I want to highlight some important things that may add more light to the question. What is the Holy Ghost? And brother Baron preached a message on it which I believe many of you have read and if you haven't you must read it. What is the Holy Ghost? And in there he covers things that a well-traought Christian or a Pentecostal would understand. &gt;&gt; Someone from the Pentecostal age and and a Pentecostal would read that message. What is the Holy Ghost to say? Yeah, I agree with everything. It's it sounds right round about what we believe. But we are not a part of the Pentecostal age &gt;&gt; and you shouldn't take it for granted that everyone is well and sufficiently taught on it. Right? You owe it to yourself to take it slow and search through the word. You love him saints. &gt;&gt; Okay. So coming back to religions of the earth, we must admit then when we think of the Holy Spirit now I'm going to start talking about it and and then uh I don't want you to get confused. I want you to stay with me. the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost, right? I'm speaking of it as if they are two different things &gt;&gt; for a reason. And so, we have a preconceived idea of it and yet we don't know where it came from. We just read in the Bible, Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost, and we got so used to it because we're Christians and because we're message believers, we don't take long enough to consider they were written that way for a specific reason by people over a thousand years ago who thought it's significant to write it differently. &gt;&gt; Right? So there are basically a few Abrahamic religions as the world calls it. The big three are Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Then there's also bahayism and to a certain extent babism that are offshoots of Islam and that are sort of draw also from Judaism. Right? Have you heard of those? Mostly uh they are mixed with pagan beliefs of Persia and Africa. The basis of these religions is this that there is one God who revealed his name Yahweh to Abraham. Amen. And uh or Abraham's people and they all believe in prophets and the constant belief is that the Holy Spirit is what God put on the prophets. They believe this long before the Holy Ghost came to us, right? long before they believed that when a prophet came, it was the spirit of God upon the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. What What am I saying to you? This is a belief that the Jews had. This is a belief that Christians had. This is a belief that Islam has. &gt;&gt; Right? This is a belief that uh these bahayas people, Bahayism and Babism also have. Now looking at that alone, is it not similar to what we believe and why we can so easily accept that God spoke through brother Brandham? Because God's spirit was in him. &gt;&gt; You're basically believing the same thing as other people, other religions. He's got this. I know if you if you um ever meet Hindu people and if you've ever seen what they call the trance and where they stick hooks in them and pull carriages and when that person gets the trance and and they believe they will tell you he's got the god on him. He's got the spirit of the god on him. To be able to do that, it has to take the spirit of the god to be on him. All right. So I want to show you this scripture from Numbers 11 29. And Moses said unto him, "Envest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them?" You know, it's not in my notes, but it's it's quite significant. He didn't say the Lord will put his spirit upon the people and make them prophets. He said would to God that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them. &gt;&gt; You can be a prophet without the spirit of the Lord because a prophet is a gift, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But it's he's pointing out for some reason is is an accepted thing of uh to earth's people from the old days that the spirit of God could come upon man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. from that. I just want to take that point that the Lord would put his spirit upon them. Can you see how far back the book of numbers &gt;&gt; we have a scripture that that confirms to us that God can put his spirit upon man, &gt;&gt; right? That's our foundation. And brother Maram is absolutely correct in that it is so easy to confuse the actions of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; because how do you know whether it is the spirit of God upon them? They're prophets. There are prophets. There is a prophet like Balum who brother Bam said was a true prophet &gt;&gt; because when he prophesied what he prophesied came true &gt;&gt; was a true prophet. &gt;&gt; But it was also a false prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is why with the with the gift of prophecy, you can have someone with the gift of prophecy and they may not have the spirit of God on them. &gt;&gt; So the only sort of proof we have of this is where the Bible speaks specifically of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost. The the four the scriptures we are going to go through um for now we we we want to glance at them. We want to draw a few conclusions and we want to discuss this. So where this uh came from for me was um many years ago, I would say over 10 years ago, I had a young person who who asked me the question, brother Al, is the is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost the same? And I thought, wow, I never thought about that. Uh because just like any normal message believer, I brother Brandham uses it interchangeably, you know, and uh I just assume they yeah, they are the same. But obviously the reason there's something in this person's heart that that they were looking for and I take questions very seriously. So I said you know let me go and studied and of course I came back with an answer that nobody really likes. The you know I said the truth is they are the same and yet not the same. And you know message believers be like dear Lord can't anything in the word just be straightforward just for once you know. So let's just get this straight from the outset. Things are only that complicated because of what man does, &gt;&gt; right? It's complicated because the scriptures were written in Hebrew and Chaldian and Aramaic or coin Greek and and then it was translated into English and here we are and you don't even speak English, you speak American, you know, and then you're you're trying to uh translate it from the English, you're trying to translate it from you're trying to understand different interpretations, you know, and and so it how do we know we are speaking exactly what was written without the Holy Holy Spirit, how are we ever going to get the correct interpretation? &gt;&gt; Amen. So things are only complicated because of what man has done. God did not complicate anything. &gt;&gt; So what we are doing is undoing what has been misinterpreted. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do. What has been misplaced and dislocated for many, many years. So how is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost the same and yet not the same? Some of you will be saying, "Brother Alistister, you're just making things up. You're not saying what Brother Baron says. Stop it." Okay, let me give you an idea. You all ready for this? &gt;&gt; Okay. Is the father and the son the same? &gt;&gt; Now, if you There's a scripture that says, "He that hath the father hath the son also." &gt;&gt; He that loveth the father loveth the son also. &gt;&gt; Is the father and the son the same? There's my answer. Yes and no. Right? Like a good extrinitarian, you will say, "But hold on, brother Al. Those are two different attributes." You know, one is an attribute of father, attribute of son. I can see you being through message university with the Holy Ghost. Brother Al, you're talking about the same thing. The Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit. It's not a different person in the Godhead. It's the same thing, just different words. Okay. Uh same person. Okay. Uh, is the word and Jesus the same? &gt;&gt; Yes and no. &gt;&gt; Because before he was Jesus, he was the word. And when he was the word, he was not known as Jesus. He became the word made flesh. And that's when the word was known as Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right? And right now, we have Jesus as the word living within us. &gt;&gt; But it's not Jesus in the flesh from 2,000 years ago literally inhabiting my being. And then I am becoming him. &gt;&gt; And yet my name is Alistister. &gt;&gt; So am I Jesus made flesh? Yes. Am I Jesus? Yes and no. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See uh you can glorify God in me but you can't glorify me. &gt;&gt; You can worship God in me but you can't worship me. &gt;&gt; Right? And Jesus himself says I I come to do the works of my father. Do not judge me for anything else but for those works sake. If you seen me, you seen the father. And then he says, glorify God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So how how about that? Jesus came and he was the word. But before Jesus came, the word was not known as Jesus. In the same way, before it was called the Holy Ghost, it was called the Holy Spirit. That's right. &gt;&gt; All we need to do is understand what the difference is. &gt;&gt; It is the same and it is not the same. Why did the writers write it differently? So what makes it the same and not the same? &gt;&gt; The manifestation. That's all the manifestation of the word in Abraham's day. The manifestation of the word in Jesus Christ. Different manifestation. Amen. That's all that happened. So let's let's understand let's look at the manifestations. If you really want to know what it is, you have to study the manifestations from the beginning all the way through to the end to understand what this really is. So, let's make a few important observations. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The phrase Holy Spirit only occurs in the Bible seven times. Three times in the Old Testament, four times in the New Testament. The the phrase Holy Ghost appears 89 times in the Bible and never in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Spirit of God appears 26 times in the Bible, 14 times in the Old Testament, and 12 times in the New Testament. So these men who were inspired by the same Holy Ghost wrote it differently. If it was all the same, why not just use Holy Ghost from the beginning? Why not just use Holy Spirit throughout? Why make a differentiation? &gt;&gt; Right? What is the point of these observations? Maybe it's just the way the interpreters of the original script chose to print it. That would be true, but for a few exceptions. So, I want to show you this. John 7 and verse 39 says, "But this spake he of the spirit which they believe on him should receive. They that believe in him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified. Right? Now you know the religious message people would say just say what it says. But what does it mean right? Anyone with a brain will tell you it's basically saying the Holy Ghost was not yet given until Jesus was glorified. &gt;&gt; So it's telling you the Holy Ghost came after Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right? At first, this lets us know the Holy Ghost only came after Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the the people who are interpreting it into English, this the reason they chose to write Holy Ghost after Jesus. &gt;&gt; There's a scripture telling us that because that Jesus was not yet glorified. The Holy Ghost was not yet given. So what did David have? &gt;&gt; What did Moses have? What did Jonah have? What did all those men of the Old Testament? Did they not have the Holy Ghost? Right? Let's go to Psalm 51:1. This is David, the one we were just talking about. He says, "Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me." So for those people who said, "Well, the Holy Ghost was not yet given." So that's why David and all of them did not have the Holy Ghost, right? So what did they have? And here we have a scripture telling us that David had something &gt;&gt; because he's saying don't take it from me. &gt;&gt; Meaning he had it &gt;&gt; and listen this is happening after he committed adultery. &gt;&gt; The reason I'm saying this is because we have other interpretations of the Holy Spirit like saying if you have mistakes you don't have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The man had he committed adultery and he's saying don't take the Holy Spirit from me. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he committed adultery. He was made he the the prophet made him know he was a sinner. He was a murderer and he was an adulterer. And he's not saying, "I've lost the Holy Ghost. I've lost the Holy Spirit." He said, "Don't take it from me." &gt;&gt; So, we judge one another by the mistakes we make. And we say, "Well, if you had the Holy Spirit, you won't do that. If you have the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't have done that. You The Holy Spirit has got nothing to do with that. All right. &gt;&gt; That's what we need to understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here David speaks as if the Holy Spirit was with him. If you're confused a little bit or you pushing back a little bit, just wait on. We're going to enjoy this journey together. &gt;&gt; Believe me. &gt;&gt; So, what did David have if the Holy Ghost was not yet given? Right. Mark 12. For David himself, now we've got in Mark, it's translated into English and it's speaking about David. For for David himself said by the Holy Ghost, the Lord said to my Lord, "Sit thou at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foottool." Oh, &gt;&gt; right. First, the Holy Ghost was not yet given until Jesus was glorified. Now, we're saying David was speaking by the Holy Ghost. Amen. I love it when it gets more confusing because then we know it's a real revelation to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, David says this by the Holy Ghost. How could how could it not have been given them? Isaiah 63:10 um and 11, but they rebelled and vexed his holy spirit. Therefore, he was turned to be their enemy. He fought against them. This is speaking of the Holy Spirit with the nation of Israel. And verse 11 says, "Then he remembered the days of Moses of old Moses and his people, saying, "Where is he that bought uh brought them out of the sea uh with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he that put his holy spirit within him?" &gt;&gt; So what we have is it looks like the Holy Spirit was within Moses &gt;&gt; as the Holy Spirit was within David, &gt;&gt; right? So did the Old Testament saints have the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost? Because we see that we see the words Holy Spirit in the Old Testament, but we see the Holy Ghost only in the New Testament. Right? If it was the same, you say, "No, brother, it's the same." And you have all the, you know, the people uh who are who get zealous about it and who believe that if they shout louder and scream louder and faint harder, then they have it, you know. No, it's the same. It's the same. Okay. So why did the Old Testament saints not speak with tongues &gt;&gt; and get slain in the spirit &gt;&gt; or have healing campaigns and jump around and scream and shout and have church? &gt;&gt; Why do they act so different? Why were there no altar calls in Moses day? Why do they not go out and same Holy Spirit you say? Why do they not act the same? Why do we want to make or define the Holy Ghost of this day only as this? &gt;&gt; Right? Why do they have to be the same Holy Spirit inspire them to be deathly silent in the tabernacle? Speak one word and you die. &gt;&gt; Now you can shout, scream, and hip hip hooray and run around screaming and act all disorderly and claim to have the Holy Spirit. But in the Old Testament, you try that. You wouldn't even make it one foot forward. You'd be dead. &gt;&gt; Same Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So, was it the Holy Spirit in the saints, on the saints, or not? What is the difference? Amen. You see, when you look at it and you ask questions, you start to see it. Why? Because the answers are in your heart. Amen. So even in the New Testament, it speaks as if God was still going to give the Holy Spirit to the New Testament people, right? Let's go to Luke 11:13. If you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? So it looks like God is willing to give the Holy Spirit to the New Testament saints. Right? Ephesians 1:13 says, "In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise." Now, we're seeing it in the New Testament. It's not just um we see this in Luke 11 and also in Ephesians which is after Christ is glorified. We see the promise that he wants to give his holy spirit to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Clearly the Gentiles did not have the Holy Spirit. Now we thought that a lot of people say the Holy Ghost sealed us, right? And here the scriptures say you are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God till the day of your redemption. There's a significant difference there and we're going to talk about that too, right? 1 Thessalonians 4:8, he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man, but God who hath also given unto us his holy spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have the Holy Spirit or not? How do you know? So yet again, it seems like the two are the same. Yet there are scriptures that said the Holy Ghost is not given before Christ. How can that be if some whole Old Testament saints also had the Holy Ghost? Right? Look at this one. Also another scripture that speaks about uh something that happened before Christ was glorified. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; Matthew 1:18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is before Acts chapter 2. You can so easily say well look Mary had the Holy Ghost. It doesn't say that. It says she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? So you agree there's a lot we need to understand. Let's not take it for granted. If you know what it is, if you believe what it or that it's given for you and it is for you and you know what results it brings, then you know what you got when you get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Mary was obviously before Christ came uh and she received the Holy Ghost to conceive Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, she could not conceive Christ. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was necessary for her to conceive. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; These are all these little beautiful clues. So we could debate many uh about many things uh but the simplicity of it is the father is a spirit. What does it even mean? The father is not a separate person. The father is a word that describes a relationship of God to man before Christ came. &gt;&gt; Right? So is the father not a holy spirit? &gt;&gt; Look at our understanding. We're saying what is a holy spirit to you and I? Holy means he's got no sin. There's no dirt. There's no filth. There's no uh shame. There's no guilt. He's holy. He's pious. He's uh No, that's not what it is, right? Holy Spirit. So, the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost is always about God's spirit upon or in man. The Holy Spirit has got to do with man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The father is spirit. Yes. What's the difference between father and holy spirit? The holy spirit has got to do with man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Jewish Bible uses the word spirit. And you you may have heard this. The word ru. Have you heard that? Which means breath or wind. Do you know the word ghost is in the old testament? And Abraham gave up the ghost &gt;&gt; and that's in the in the Hebrew. It's a completely different to which is spirit. Two separate words. One is ghost, one is spirit. Starts giving us more clues, right? So in the Greek, which is now the New Testament, they didn't have this word ghost, which is English. It comes from the German word ghast g a s t which eventually came to be ghost. But then what is a ghost, &gt;&gt; right? Why would they use the word ghost? &gt;&gt; Apparently ghost is the spirit of someone who has died. &gt;&gt; Which is made visible. &gt;&gt; I saw the spirit. It was a ghost. &gt;&gt; So the spirit is invisible. But when it's visible, it's ghost. That's right. &gt;&gt; They had some reasoning behind what they were writing. &gt;&gt; They were not silly men. I tell you that. &gt;&gt; Right. So, it's the same thing, but not the same. There it is. We just have to understand what the meaning was. Right? So, uh ghast in the old English means a spirit that can physically be seen. Like, well, you know, people will say, "What's the matter with you? You look like you saw a ghost." &gt;&gt; You've heard that. You look like you've seen a ghost. Uh, and in the old English there would be the word apparition. &gt;&gt; You saw something. Something that should have been invisible became visible to you. &gt;&gt; So basically, it's so simple. It has much more to do with the change in dispensation because what it was showing was that the spirit of God, the spirit of Christ was becoming visible upon the people &gt;&gt; and they called that the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because they began to see his spirit becoming visible. How? Because they know what these men were doing was not their own spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Christ coming upon them and they called it the ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the change in dispensation brought forth change in manifestations of the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So under the ages of the father from Adam right up to the conception of Christ for 4,000 years God's spirit upon men upon men anointing them being in them were only for prophets priests kings and judges not for all the public &gt;&gt; like you could see when Hannah was standing in the temple and she was she was whispering and and praying and Eli comes up to her and says what are you mad What are you doing? You know this is not allowed. Only we are supposed to speak to God, not you. You have no authority. And then she had to explain herself and he understood and and you can't be here in the temple doing this. You literally asked her, "Are you drunk?" &gt;&gt; Because only a drunk person would have the guts to do something like what you're doing right now. You must be out of your mind. Can you imagine that? You and I stand here and whisper and pray and there's no problem with that. At that time, the Holy Spirit was seen as something specifically for prophets, priests, judges, and kings, men chosen by God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not for the public. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And what happened with the Holy Spirit? Now, think of the same Holy Spirit that's on you on the Holy Spirit on those Old Testament saints. You know what they did with that spirit? It anointed them to do miraculous work. and they identified a fearsome God, &gt;&gt; right? If for example, Moses brings 10 plagues that decimates an entire nation of of Egypt, &gt;&gt; kills the firstborn by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Pillars of fire, Jericho's walls falling, son standing still, Mary's body receiving the blood cell. All those things leading up to that time, they were given abilities to kill their enemies and even their brothers who went into error. Same Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Remember Finance when one of the his brothers took uh a Medidionite woman, he took a javelin and ran him through. &gt;&gt; How many of you feel like running a javelin through your brother who makes a mistake? &gt;&gt; You have the same Holy Spirit. Not &gt;&gt; what what is the difference? &gt;&gt; Something has changed in the dispensation. In the Old Testament, the greatness of the manifestations was seen in ways that is unmistakably not man's works. It was the Holy Spirit because we can identify that it was God's works. Only God could have done that. &gt;&gt; Inspire them to do that. Right. Great manifestations. They knew that man was not bringing the plagues. Yeah, &gt;&gt; God was the one speaking through Moses. &gt;&gt; It was God's spirit in Moses. They knew that. And and so um they had abilities that today we just don't do. I mean, my my little boy asked me a month ago or something. He says, "So why don't why don't you do things why don't those great things happen today like opening the Red Sea and you know, why don't you have all these great things? you I mean it's like you could open the sea and walk all the way to brother Chad's church you know why don't you do that why do you have to uh fly why why why do you not do things like they did in those days can make a father feel really insignificant and be a preacher of God right in the New Testament then Jesus comes and says I forgive you they're beating him they're cursing at him they're spitting on him and it says Father, forgive them. They know not what they do. Same Holy Spirit sir &gt;&gt; that would drive a javelin through a man, kill, decimate a nation, uh bring plagues upon people, bring suffering, suddenly it flips. Same Holy Spirit and it's just forgiveness and grace. What changed? Okay, this showing that it was not just an invisible spirit. Peter's shadow healed people. &gt;&gt; Laying on hands uh laying on of hands healed people. Men's voices seemed to raise the dead. To the people, this was a ghost. An invisible spirit made visible in normal men of even low degree or even insignificant status of life. Because after Jesus, the Holy Ghost fell upon all Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just prophets, priests, judges, and kings. &gt;&gt; Now it fell upon all flesh. Significant difference. &gt;&gt; The writers were saying this is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between this one and the manifestation of the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Old Testament writers believe this anointing on men uh to be the actual breath of God or an invisible moving force. They call it the ru hakodesh in the Hebrew. And this is why the English translators chose to identify it as the holy spirit because the English translators interpreted spirit as breath. Right? For example, a dying person's breath leaving him was his spirit leaving him. And the other word used in the Hebrew uh in the same context is shakina. But in some places, the translators still use Holy Spirit. I don't know about you, but I love to know everything about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave a little piece out. I want to know everything about it so that I know what I've got when I get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it was the same Holy Spirit of God anointing man differently for different dispensations. Do we all get that? The writers of this New Testament wrote in Aramaic. They wrote in Greek and they use words described as air or breath. In the in the Greek it's numa if those of you searching it up. So again this is where the translators use the word holy spirit. But when they use the words anointing power etc they were referring to the holy ghost. Amen. So spirit power and anointing ghost spirit holy spirit that which is within you doing something but holy ghost power and anointing are we together right so the writers and translators knew the difference and they tried to express it differently giving it a name that would show the difference and the definition then the holy ghost or the holy spirit basically saints is the anointing of god for mankind now we got understand why it's necessary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you still with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In every dispensation, it changes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every dispensation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We got to understand why it changes because the Holy Spirit is obedient to something. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason it changes. &gt;&gt; Okay? Same Holy Spirit, but it's changing because it's obedient to something. What is it? obedient to the revelation of the word for that day. &gt;&gt; It's going to anoint you. You know, like how the prophet says Moses couldn't take Noah's revelation and build an ark and sail out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that wasn't the word for that day. &gt;&gt; Moses would not have received the Holy Spirit ability to build an ark. &gt;&gt; That's right. And even though it would have been the word for a previous day and a great anointing and great ability would have been fantastic to see Moses and the people in Goan building an ark, it wasn't going to work. &gt;&gt; It was going to be an interpretation that was not going to work for their day because the Holy Spirit was not going to anoint them on the word of Noah's day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost is influence or rather follows the word for the day. That's why the manifestation is different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the full revelation of the word is come, the manifestations of the spirit need no longer be seen because the people would manifest the works by faith, not needing gifts or sensations &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit is bringing you up to receive the full word. And when you have the full word, you are going to have the full manifestation of Christ made flesh. And you don't need help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is what that Holy Spirit is. It's help. It's a guide. Amen. Now everything becomes one. It's the fullness of the Godhead bodily when it brings you up to that time when you become the word made flesh. Listen, I'm not saying you don't need the Holy Ghost anymore. Don't make that mistake. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Let's understand. So therefore, today people are expecting. This is the reason it's confusing because people are expecting to have the Holy Ghost like Acts chapter 2. &gt;&gt; And listen people, you know what a mockery it's been, right? From Pentecost all the way up to now. And it's what they call speaking in tongues was just glosselia. That's not what happened in Acts chapter 2. You know that they spoke different languages of other men &gt;&gt; and and I don't know how the churches just let it slip and all you get is glosselia which is just like gibberish being spoken &gt;&gt; and they just claim by by the Holy Ghost you know this is another language where there's actually supposed to be a person who speaks that language that interprets that. And then what we had is churches having someone speaking in in a tongue and then interpreting that &gt;&gt; themselves and then it's not even interpreted by two or three witnesses to establish it. It's just accepted as a gift. And why? Because people are afraid. &gt;&gt; I was just telling brother Chad this and just just um a little bit off topic. When you take a gift of the Holy Ghost and and this is something serious that we did with people is um the gifts of the Holy Ghost have to be under subjection of humility because it's so easy to go to pride &gt;&gt; right now. And I asked my church this just last week. I said to them, uh how many of you here been in the message for like 30, 40 years? Let's see your hands. How many of you been here? 30 40 years in the message. Yes. So, how many of you you remember the uh people who spoke with tongues and prophesied? How many of you can remember yourself being comfortable with them? You were more terrified that they were going to expose you. That that's what I hope he doesn't prophesy about me. I hope he doesn't say something bad about me. Not that you have something bad, but you just w with these gifts somehow these gifts always speak bad things. There's just never any good things that they prophesy about. Just always something bad, you know. And so what happens is this fear sort of builds up in the people about this person with the gift. Now what happens when you do that? When you make yourself fearful of someone, you are giving that person power. &gt;&gt; Power that corrupts him. Yes. &gt;&gt; See, and it shouldn't be that way because this man should be under humility. &gt;&gt; He should know, he should he should know that this people should not fear him. And when you fear a man, you start to give him power that corrupts him. We corrupt them. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And that's what's happened in the churches. Right. So saints, when the full revelation of the word has come and we have the manifestation of the spirit, we need to see the proper manifestation of the spirit. That's for this day. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; All right. So let's get to it. Today people are expecting to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost like Acts chapter 2, but it's a different dispensation. How do we know? Because the word is different. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost must anoint people according to the word &gt;&gt; for the day. &gt;&gt; Agreed. All right. So, this is where we must find the middle of the road. Let's go to a quote here. I promise you, we're halfway. &gt;&gt; Now, here the life that was in the husk, this is the message masterpiece. in the stalk and the tassel and the husk all gathers in the seed. And the life that was in the stalk went uh one went to make the other. Justification made a way for sanctification. Sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And here it is. The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself. So see, I wasn't saying that when you have the fullness of the word, there's no need for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What what we are saying is there's no need for manifestations that were necessary when you didn't have the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Let me give you the picture, right? So when they came out of the upper room and they've got no tapes, no CDs, no message, no Bibles, &gt;&gt; they've got no written word to back up what they're saying. &gt;&gt; They're coming out to say Jesus Christ is God made flesh. He was crucified. He died and rose again. And we are witnesses of that. And what are the people going to say? Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Prove it. &gt;&gt; Prove it. Yes. &gt;&gt; So with what little word they had, they required gifts of the Holy Ghost to vindicate what they were saying, &gt;&gt; to vindicate their message. So the gifts of the Holy Ghost at that time and the the less word you have, the greater the manifestations need to be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? And this is why as it progressed and the more the word came in, the less they needed help from the Holy Ghost to vindicate their word. &gt;&gt; And then we reached the end of the ages where you got this prophet &gt;&gt; who's coming with the message to saying to say I am the forerunner of the second coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And what are the people going to say? Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; prove it. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So there needs to be a manifestation to vindicate the word that he's bringing. &gt;&gt; And that's why in the last day there needed to be an outpouring of the Holy Ghost again to vindicate something that was coming in. &gt;&gt; That's how it works. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when people are saying we need to see this, I know there's some some places in Africa where they're insisting like today uh when I mean now in 2025, you'll have ministers saying every single pastor must have the supernatural following him. He must have some kind of uh supernatural manifestation or else he's not a true minister. like he he must either prophesy or speak with tongues and then it puts pressure on the men and then the men start faking things &gt;&gt; and and to what to what end &gt;&gt; you have the fullness of the word the fullness of the word is come. So so then if you are still depending on the ability to vindicate you why do we need to vindicate a word that has already been vindicated. &gt;&gt; It has been fully vindicated. &gt;&gt; We are preaching word that has already been fully vindicated. So then what do I need to vindicate myself? If I want to vindicate myself, then I have serious inferiority complex. &gt;&gt; Then I need to prove myself to the people to elevate myself. &gt;&gt; That's not what the holy the Holy Ghost is not going to clown for anyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Back to the word again to manifest itself. But when denominated well what denominated dies like life in Lutheran we're reading again went to make Wesley and from Wesley went to Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the original seed onto Pentecost comes out of the Wesley until that time. The reason that Pentecost come out of Wesley because it was no denomination. Uh Pentecost was the this is what I want to get to. Then Pentecost went to denominate and what did it do? It turned to the husk. It looked like the real thing. &gt;&gt; Pentecost looked like the real thing. &gt;&gt; You know I I keep telling um message people please when you are reading things like this understand that the prophet is talking about himself. What's he telling you? He's the real thing. That's right. &gt;&gt; Go read the message. He'll tell you. We've had all the Elijah's mantels and the rushing winds and we've had the blood in the hands and we've had all of this. We've had impersonations. Impersonations of what? &gt;&gt; He's being humble. &gt;&gt; He's telling you they are impersonations of his gift, &gt;&gt; of his ministry. The more he came out and he came out with the first pool, everybody wanted the same or even better. And then they all had to come out with something extra special to to overdo what or rather to to to um uh have preeminence over what he had. And then when he when he was in his second pool, then they all wanted to have something else. &gt;&gt; And then he would start concocting things and having interviews with people and getting to know the secret lives. And be careful of today. There are people doing that. &gt;&gt; Do you know how easy it is in Pentecostal churches? It's so sorrowful, pitiful that these people are so duped by all these men with gifts. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to have your secret fell there in the back going on Facebook and looking at somebody's profile and he's got a mic in he's got a thing in here saying this person was uh you know uh in Africa last week and they were wearing this color clothes. The man stands, I see you in Africa and you were wearing these clothes and you had a pearl necklace on. But his inspiration is coming from Facebook and the guy in his ear. &gt;&gt; I'm from Africa. I've seen these people do this, &gt;&gt; do tricks with the iPads and whatever. And and they're claiming this to be gifts of the Holy Ghost. It's so easy to act like you have discernment to try and be like the prophet. In the meantime, you're using social media &gt;&gt; and the people just don't even know that. I I don't understand. Then he shows how that Pentecost or brother Brandham's day, his day, had the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but yet there was still the Holy Ghost person still to come, which is our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you see that in the quote? &gt;&gt; Right. Justification made way for sanctification. sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And here it is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection. He's literally giving us the process. &gt;&gt; And now in a day where you and I are to be receiving the person, &gt;&gt; the the people, the ministers want you to go back and get the baptism &gt;&gt; of the previous day. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the baptism. You and I individually still have to go. We have to go through our own process of justification, sanctification. He was talking about similar to the seed, right? What was the seed goes from the seed goes to the stalk, the leaves, the tassel, the husk. He said the husk looks like the real thing. &gt;&gt; People will take the baptism of the Holy Ghost, excuse me, and it looks like the real thing, but the real thing is something else. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's go through a summary. Let's go to E is um Ezekiel. Oh, I didn't read that second half for you. I'll put on the screen. Ezekiel 36:26 27. You love him, saints. &gt;&gt; You know this very very well. A new heart also will I give you. A new spirit will I put within you. And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh. And I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So up to that point, I mean, you have a new heart, you get a new spirit, you get a new nature. Basically, I will take away your stony heart and all of that. But we know the final desire of God is that his spirit &gt;&gt; dwells in you. &gt;&gt; Not gifts, not anointings. &gt;&gt; I will put my spirit within you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now people look at that today and say his spirit within me must produce all the the the signs and wonders and miracles and so on. His spirit is not going to do what you wanted to do. &gt;&gt; It's going to follow the word for the day. &gt;&gt; That's what's important, &gt;&gt; right? Look at Joel chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Okay. And it shall come to pass after with that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters. Now this is listen what he wanted to do was put his spirit within you. But Joel prophesied of the spirit upon you &gt;&gt; upon all flesh and your sons and daughters. And he's identifying you're going to prophesy. You're going to dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmmaids. So when it came in Acts chapter 2, Peter says this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel. So he is identifying that what came in Acts chapter 2 was what Joel prophesied of the spirit upon all flesh. The anointing on the flesh, not the spirit of God within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold that thought. Notice the difference. &gt;&gt; Acts 2 was the fulfillment of Joel, not Ezekiel. &gt;&gt; Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Ezekiel is not pouring out my spirit upon all flesh. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel is putting my spirit within the elect. &gt;&gt; Not the rain falling on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; God does not put his spirit in people who will then lose it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see why the same and not the same? &gt;&gt; Right? Let's move on. So his spirit upon everyone is all right because it helps push an agenda. It helps push God's agenda for that age and gets the church moving forward. But when it comes to the capstone time, it has to do with the spirit of God in his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we should be desiring. Amen. So uh father, word, son, holy spirit, holy ghost and then it must lead to the fullness of everything in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? And if we can define the differences between father and son, word and son, why are we afraid or too religious to differentiate between holy spirit and holy ghost? &gt;&gt; Let's have a look. What is the holy spirit? Right? It is the anointing of god given for man. You can start there. The Holy Spirit originally worked with the spirit of man only originally from the Old Testament. After Christ came, the Holy Spirit changed to a new dispensation. It became the Holy Ghost dispensation &gt;&gt; over church ages. Is that right? And the Holy Spirit which once anointed entire beings of prophets, high priest, listen. Elijah ran before the chariot of Ahab. That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has no desire to make you do that today. &gt;&gt; There's no reason for that. &gt;&gt; Not even to prove something to you, &gt;&gt; right? Uh so the Holy Spirit anointed their entire being. I mean it gave if you try to run faster than a horse, your heart will pack up in 10 minutes. Not even 10 minutes. In fact, in 2025, we wouldn't make it 100 meters. &gt;&gt; That's how &gt;&gt; unhealthy we are. &gt;&gt; So, I'm just saying that that's not even a normal thing that the human body can do. That would have to take the Holy Spirit to anoint to give ability to the body to do that. &gt;&gt; Right? It's a it's an an abnormal ability &gt;&gt; that we know can only come from God. So the Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit anointing the flesh of all men and women who believe. Agreed? So the Holy Ghost was differentiated by the scribes of uh the Bible as the Holy Spirit, the same Holy Spirit that was in David, the same Holy Spirit that anointed Moses. The Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit except now it's following the word of Christ. go into the world, baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost, cast out devils, heal the sick. That's the word of Christ. Now, that same Holy Spirit that was anointing men to kill the enemies, now it's anointing men to follow the word of Christ, &gt;&gt; right? It's not going to go back. Even if those people, Peter and Paul and all these men being put into prison and uh the the the saints being eaten by lions and bears in the circus, you know, they could have been praying, Lord, give me the power to stand up and destroy all these gladiators. Go and w you know, whack off the head of the emperor of Rome and give us the victory. The Holy Spirit was not going to do that. &gt;&gt; It's following the word for the day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Barham uses, here's an uh more to it. Brother Barham uses both phrases, Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit, interchangeably as if they are the same. That's why I want to tell you young people, all we're doing today is just simplifying it for you so that you don't doubt what you have &gt;&gt; and you don't judge yourself by other people or by some revelation or something of some other man. You need to know and and so when they say the Holy Spirit here when brother says the Holy Spirit here know that he's talking about the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; the gifts when he's talking about the Holy Ghost here know that he's talking about the baptism but know other places when he's talking about here is talking about the person &gt;&gt; know the difference &gt;&gt; right amen &gt;&gt; are you with me &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; all right so brother taught the difference between having the baptism of the Holy Ghost and having the person of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; right? Brother Bham also taught that the Holy Spirit was once given with measure, &gt;&gt; but the hol the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the fullness of the Holy Spirit spread over the church. How fullness? Some would have a gift of this, others would have a gift of that. Not every person has the fullness of the gift in one person, right? &gt;&gt; But the fullness is spread out over the entire body of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. The baptism of the Holy Ghost upon a single person is the anointing of the Holy Spirit to give a particular ability to that believer that is necessary not even for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's for God's purpose for the church &gt;&gt; for other people. The baptism of the Holy Ghost given for Peter was so that the word could be believed by others. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's a purpose behind it. Amen. The purpose for vindicating the word to others. The Holy Spirit was described as that which followed the leading of the father ministry. In other words, the Old Testament, the Holy Ghost was described as that which is following the son's ministry. &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not going too fast. So this is how it all happened. The Holy Spirit is an attribute of God. It's just English words, right? It's an attribute of God which came into manifestation when the first man was created to give that man power on earth to be God on earth. Why? Because he was flesh. If he's given the spirit of God, now he becomes the vessel of God to fulfill the purpose of God. Right? So that's why I said the Holy Spirit has got to do with man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when you got that then you understand the true mystery of the godhead is it becomes in the end time it the trinity to the the Catholic is father son holy spirit. But when you understand what holy spirit is, then you find yourself in the &gt;&gt; godhead. &gt;&gt; Then you know it's father, son, and bride &gt;&gt; complete because the holy spirit was given to bring anointing to mankind. &gt;&gt; And you and I must find ourselves in the godhead. &gt;&gt; That is the mystery of it. &gt;&gt; Tell that to a Catholic, they'll kill you. When man sinned, he lost constant contact with the Holy Spirit along with his theophony. Right? As time passed, God anointed certain prophets, kings, and priests with measure by inspiring them by the Holy Spirit to fulfill a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying is Gideon received the Holy Spirit to go and do what he had to do. And then Gideon went home and that which he was inspired with was over. Now he was Gideon again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Gideon was making mistakes that he should not have. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Which means the Holy Ghost came for a purpose regarding the word and that's it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; At that time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then he went back to being Gideon again and you know got old and uh made mistakes with him and his family and took the ephford and people started making an idol of it. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Same man who had this great manifestation. One of the greatest battles we read of in the Bible. He had the Holy Spirit. How could a man we would say how could a man with the Holy Spirit go and take the eph and make an idol out of it? How could Samson having the Holy Spirit go and commit adultery knowing that he's a Nazerite? &gt;&gt; And then God still use him, give him the Holy Spirit at the right time to bring down a temple and then he dies. &gt;&gt; As time passed, God, in other words, they received the Holy Spirit for a season. They fulfilled their purpose and then it passed. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Christ came, he changed the revelation of God to man. A new revelation of God was coming forth. The Holy Spirit now could anoint the flesh of them that believed on Christ because Christ was the the re the mystery of God revealed to them. &gt;&gt; Right now, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on a group of people in Acts chapter 2 was called for the first time the baptism &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. We're going to understand what that means in a little while. See, I didn't say just now, brother. The outpouring of the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon a group of people was given in the Pentecostal age. Right there in the beginning, right? And now we receive again a baptism of the Holy Ghost former and latter reign in the end time. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. So the baptism of the Holy Ghost then has to make way for the person of the Holy Ghost to come into the believer. Not just an anointing to push an agenda, but now to come into the believer by the believer accepting and believing completely the full revealed word for the day. &gt;&gt; They could not do that in all the other ages. So the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost, whatever you want to call him, anointing and so on was leading so that the eventual person could come into us. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The believer is sealed by that Holy Spirit, not the baptism. &gt;&gt; We're going to find that out, too. &gt;&gt; So, this would follow the father to take his place and start living and dwelling in the soul of man. This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased to dwell in. God comes and says in Revelations 21, these are my people. I shall be their God. I am dwelling with them. I am in them. I am dwelling uh in them. I am with them. They are my tabernacle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost can be received by those who believe with their mind with their minds and not with their heart. The baptism because it falls in the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; These make believers can receive the Holy Ghost, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and still go to hell. &gt;&gt; But you cannot receive the person &gt;&gt; and go to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let's look at what and you can go through the message. We're drawing it to close. You can go through the entire message and you can see how the prophet targets sensations, right? And speaks about sensations. And I love that he's done this, right? I'm just showing you some statements. I'm not going to put up the whole quote, just statements. Look at this one. Don't try to have any sensation or anything take the place of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; When the new birth is come, you are changed. &gt;&gt; Don't let sensations take the place of the Holy Spirit. That's right. &gt;&gt; Look at the next one. Every person that's been born again of the Holy Spirit uh truly born, not just thought they were born, &gt;&gt; not went through some emotion, not went through some sensation, but was truly born. They could have all the emotion sensation with it, but you have you could have the sensation and emotion and not be born. &gt;&gt; How about this one? God don't want you to run after gifts. He wants you to thirst after him. &gt;&gt; I I would rather see young people. I would rather see that &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; because I know there there's a promise that comes with thirsting after him. &gt;&gt; Him that thirsts after righteousness, &gt;&gt; hungers and thirsts after righteous, you shall be filled. &gt;&gt; Go looking for that. Don't run after gifts. Don't run after signs. Amen. Thirst for him. That's what he wants. How about this? We cannot base our salvation upon sensations or experiences of others or on our own experiences experience. It's you cannot even base your salvation on your own experience. &gt;&gt; It's got to be the word of God because that's the true mark. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's the true mark. You know what he speaks about in the in what is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is a mark. It's a seal. &gt;&gt; It's an identification of something. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the word of God is the true mark. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Okay, so I want to get to this thought. Lost and not lost. Okay, let's start with having the Holy Ghost and going to hell. In leadership, he says the choice of your conduct. You could you can mix it now. Now you're either of God or against God. And the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside. The cocka many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm going to heaven. That don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven. No sir. You can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell. The Bible says so. Uh-huh. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I know you've heard this before. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But this is why it's important to separate what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have the anointing &gt;&gt; every hour in your life and go to hell, &gt;&gt; not the person. &gt;&gt; And God does not give the person willy-nilly to people. &gt;&gt; So why was the anointing given? The anointing of the same spirit. What is anointing? Ability. Yes. &gt;&gt; Why is ability given to vindicate the word &gt;&gt; to push a purpose or an agenda? Right. How about this one? There's a question someone asked, "Brother Bam, if possible for a person to be lost and end up in hell if he rejects the light of the word even though he has a genuine experience of justification and sanctification." There's two things in that question. Brother Ram said, "Yes, sir. That's exactly right. You can have a genuine experience of justification and sanctification and reject the word. &gt;&gt; Why was that possible? Because there was a time, you know, justification is a is a is an experience. Sanctification is an experience. And this is what people struggle with understanding how you can have all these experiences and we go back in our past and say, well, I know for sure who I am because this on this date and so on. We're so good at that. On that date and this time, this brother did this and whatever. I remember that was the day of my salvation. I'm homeward bound. Glory to God. How many people have we heard saying that and then they come and deny the open book &gt;&gt; and deny the seven seal is open &gt;&gt; and deny the thunders and place it in the future. &gt;&gt; How is how is the Holy Spirit? You can have the Holy Ghost and do that. &gt;&gt; But having the Holy Spirit, you will not do that. &gt;&gt; Do you understand young people? Big difference. &gt;&gt; Then look at this one. And I know we read the scripture earlier, but let's look at what the prophet says. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Young people, I hope you're catching. Ephesians 4:30, which says, "You are sealed by the Holy Spirit till the day of your redemption." I want you to notice what the prophet says. The Holy Ghost is God's Easter seal that seals us for eternity. Amen. Seals us for eternity. Now, this is what I'm pointing you to. He's not saying the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the Easter Seal. &gt;&gt; This is why I say he uses it interchangeably. &gt;&gt; And I love it because that's why it is in mystery form. &gt;&gt; How can you in in one place he says you can have the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and go to hell. &gt;&gt; But there he says the Holy Ghost is God's Easter Seal and seals us for eternity. &gt;&gt; And moving on, it says God's Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, are you glad? Are you glad for Easter? Are you glad for this experience? Sealed. Shut in with God in a secret place. Shut in with God by his divine grace. Sealed till the day of our redemption. That's the true that's a real true Easter seal. So which is true? One is the anointing and one is the divine nature of the person. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. However you want to say it, they are just words. words that people use, words that the prophet used interchangeably, but you need to know young people clearly what it is referring to. And old people are starting to doubt your experience. You need to know what it means when you are reading all those quotes and statements because there's going to be ministries and people who are going to come up and use the same thing and tell you that you're supposed to be doing this, you're supposed to be having this, you're supposed to be feeling this. And the worst thing is they're going to judge your life and say to you, if you have the Holy Spirit, you won't do this. &gt;&gt; If you have the Holy Ghost, you won't do this. If you have this, you won't. This won't happen. And we start judging one another and judging ourselves by that. &gt;&gt; God is not interested in your feelings or your emotions. God is concerned with only one thing, his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to uh finding the middle of the road with this. This is the message. Hebrews chapter 1. You still with me? &gt;&gt; Now on this side, when people get converted, their minds is set on Christ and they're just a little scholarly. Amen. And don't keep under prayer, they get real cold and stiff and starchy and indifferent. And then if they're just a little bit nervous, if you I like how he says that a little bit nervous. He's being so nice. I'm not as nice. If you don't watch, they just get radical and wild on this side. See? And they go into sensations and everything. Paragraph 71. But the real church is a real sane gospel &gt;&gt; right in the middle of the road. It's not cold and starchy. Neither is it fanaticism. It's a real good old warm gospel heartfelt love of God going right down the middle of the road calling from both sides. That's right. That's what how you going to get that church right out of the word the urum and thumb. &gt;&gt; What are we saying? All right. So, this is where we bring it together. How does one stay in the middle of the road with sensations? I know how complex we are saints. I know what I've been in the message since I'm 5 years old, right? Or the message was on upon me until I got into it, however you want to say it, right? But I've seen it. I I've I've watched it develop. I've watched the people around. I've I've been criticized by people from the time I'm a I'm a teenager and telling me about this or about my dressing or my hairstyle or whatever. You know, if you if you had a sneaker with white laces, it was worldly. If you put colored laces, it was worldly. If it was a certain type of brand, it was worldly. I mean, you could you might as well go barefoot. If you used cream in your hair, it's worldly. If you left it dry and floppy, it's worldly. Everything is just worldly. There's like nowhere to walk because every single person has a different idea about something. You know, I told our our church last week, some of you have gotten so holy in your dressing, you wouldn't have Sister Ma in your church. &gt;&gt; You'll kick her out because you gotten so holy. Some of you gotten so holy, you'll kick Brother out. &gt;&gt; I mean, you should see what's going on in Africa. We become this people that's like we've got these standards that's that's way out there that nobody can attain. It's like what Christ was telling the Pharisees. You put a burden upon the people that you yourself won't even uh uh push or even lift. &gt;&gt; And we're judging people based on those things on the on what? On what our idea of the Holy Spirit is. Right? &gt;&gt; How do we find the middle of the road? So, here's what happens. Like I'm telling you, I've been through this. You've got some people who who uh will say, "Well, we've got the word, you know, and our our song service is perfect." And another church comes and tells us, "You guys are dead. There's no spirit in you." Well, that's based on what their interpretation of spirit is. And then we will go to their church and we say, "Man, these guys don't have the spirit. They're so rowdy. There's just no order. They have this and that. You know, I see because even my little fellow, my my son is so judgmental about us and about other people and everything because he's used to something his way. I can see it actually in the children. So, you get under this pressure and I like what brother Mhamm says. It's not cold and starchy. Neither is it fanaticism. &gt;&gt; We've got to pull it together &gt;&gt; and get the middle of the road. There needs to be expression. &gt;&gt; You cannot be an old dead stick &gt;&gt; in the presence of God. If God has done something in your heart, there has to be an expression. &gt;&gt; There has to be an uh even something individual. &gt;&gt; It's quite simple. Be honest with yourself first. &gt;&gt; Are you feeling what you claim to be feeling? If you are having a genuine sensation as God's word is proceeding, it will manifest itself as the spirit within you and will lead you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The most important thing, it will be in line with the word. &gt;&gt; That's what we got to watch for saints. If what you're doing is causing a stumbling block or confusion, then you have to adjust yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word will adjust you with grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is crucial. It should not make the church uncomfortable or nervous. Your gift should not do that to someone. &gt;&gt; Your expression should not do that to someone. It and and you don't stand there and you're losing your mind in the spirit and then you're nudging someone. Come on, be one of us. &gt;&gt; If he just wants to stand there and be quiet and just tear come down his eye, that's his expression. That's right. &gt;&gt; That the beautiful part of the Holy Spirit in each person is it's unique. &gt;&gt; And and God knows our lives. God knows our heart. He knows exactly how the word in us. He knows what word actually is residing in our soul. And our expression is going to be based upon that. And there's going to be a purpose that God has to fulfill through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Based on what word you have inside. So this is crucial. It should not make the church uncomfortable or nervous. Listen, the same Holy Ghost that made David strip off his clothes and dance before the ark is the same Holy Ghost that's anointing you to make sure you keep your clothes on &gt;&gt; in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But it was necessary that day and the person his own wife criticizing him for doing that. God judged her for it &gt;&gt; because it was the anointing of God in his life doing that. But it won't do that with us today because there is a word today &gt;&gt; that is carrying a different agenda, different purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, as we close this down, there's something we need to look at. Baptism and holy. Okay. So, baptism of the Holy Ghost. What is baptism? What is the meaning of baptism? Okay. It's a Jewish concept. It's a Jewish tradition. And they used baptism like pouring water over Aaron the high priest. It was an outward expression of something that was being done, inducting him into a body. &gt;&gt; That's what it was for. But what was it signifying? Washing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Washing away. Washing away what? Purging. Purging what? So we know what baptism now is. And now what is holy, right? Holy means set apart for purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Holy has got nothing to do with cood. Because if you say be holy as your father in heaven is holy. &gt;&gt; What's that about? &gt;&gt; The father in heaven doesn't wear shorts. He doesn't have to worry about TV or music or &gt;&gt; so what what is the holiness of the father? &gt;&gt; How are you to be holy as your father in heaven is holy? He is holy because he's committed to his purpose. &gt;&gt; He is set apart for his purpose. &gt;&gt; So if you are holy, it's calling you to be set apart for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen people, living right, dressing right is reasonable service. It's actually common sense. &gt;&gt; You know, um um if you see me standing here in a pair of shorts and a torn t-shirt and and tattoos all over me and an earring and and here am I preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost. What is the efficacy of my message? &gt;&gt; Where is the the efficiency? Where is the the power of my message? My presentation of myself is diminishing my message. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So I'm saying that those things are just reasonable service. You you can't be um uh dressed like a hobo and then go ask to be a pilot &gt;&gt; to fly that plane. The people are going to jump off at the moment they see you. &gt;&gt; Because you're you're d and he could actually be a pilot dressed as a hobo. &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to trust him. &gt;&gt; You understand? All that has to do with making your message more efficient, more direct, more powerful. &gt;&gt; But that's got nothing to do with your holiness. as in are you in your heart dedicated &gt;&gt; to the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; That is holiness. &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost is being washed from a previous purpose &gt;&gt; to induct you into a new purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Washing all previous ambitions and purposes away and bringing that's why young people that's what it means by be baptized with the Holy Ghost means put aside your other ambitions. &gt;&gt; It means putting away all other whatever your career is. And if you're going to have a career, your purpose of God is going to be included in your career. &gt;&gt; See, for example, you can't say I'm the bride of Christ and I want to be a fashion designer. &gt;&gt; Right? in Milan. &gt;&gt; How is that possible? &gt;&gt; How is the purpose of God included in that? &gt;&gt; Right? Or I want to be a pastor and a full-time fisherman. &gt;&gt; It's it doesn't it doesn't work. It's it it doesn't make sense. It it it doesn't it doesn't have a a purpose that combines, &gt;&gt; right? So, Holy Spirit and this is where I want to close with. What is then Holy Spirit? When we break it down, what does Holy Spirit actually mean? If holy has got to do with purpose and the purpose of God and spirit means divine nature or nature, then what we have is the purposeful nature. How do I know I have the Holy Spirit? I have the purposeful nature. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. &gt;&gt; I want my life driven by his purpose. &gt;&gt; I want to know what the purpose of God is for this day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, if I know what the purpose of God is for this day, how am I going to be blackmailed by somebody who's telling me I need to get the Holy Ghost of another day? How am I going to be pressurized to act like something of another day that has got nothing to do with the purpose of this day? &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, as we close, what is the purpose of your day? &gt;&gt; And I went unto the angel and said unto him, give me the little book. And he said unto me, take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And eat it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter. So you have, if you didn't know about something you have to do, here it is. Take it and eat it up. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for you. &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. We all know that. And verse 11 says, "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." And this is where you got people saying, you see, we must prophesy. You must speak with tongues. No, you must prophesy to many tongues. &gt;&gt; That means many languages of the earth. You must you must prophesy. You must speak &gt;&gt; to the world. &gt;&gt; There's your purpose for today. So what's the purpose? Take the book, speak the word. This has never been given to any other age before. &gt;&gt; This is the purpose of the bride today. &gt;&gt; Take the book. Speak the word. There it is. So, what is your purpose, young people? Speaking the word. &gt;&gt; Taking the word. Now, this is what I find frustrating today is that people who are taking the word don't seem to be speaking. Either you feel pressurized that you're not allowed to speak. And I'm not just I don't just mean speaking as in with your mouth. Of course, you need to. It's telling you that the word that you took needs to be manifested &gt;&gt; to all kingdoms and nations and tribes and people, &gt;&gt; to your neighbor in the street, &gt;&gt; to the people you come in contact with, &gt;&gt; I feel like it needs to change. That's why we're feeling like something is missing. &gt;&gt; There needs to be a shift. &gt;&gt; It needs to change. You've got Pentecostal people, uh, denominational people, they they'll meet you somewhere and they'll they'll come up to you and say, "Have you been saved? Have you been born again?" And and you're thinking like, "If only you know." And then you walk away. &gt;&gt; What happened to your voice? &gt;&gt; What happened to your testimony? &gt;&gt; What happened to the witnesses? &gt;&gt; How are we going to fill Revelations 10:8-11? Number one, you can't do it unless you take the book. &gt;&gt; And you need the Holy Spirit to be able to take the book. The Holy Spirit is the one saying, "Take the book, eat it up. This is what's going to happen." You take that word in, and then you have to speak it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, when I was uh a young man and running away from the ministry, a very humble minister who brought correction to me told me something. He said, "If you take the book and eat the book and you have this word inside you and you are not &gt;&gt; speaking it, it's going to corrupt you. &gt;&gt; You're going to be like a well that's and it's got no &gt;&gt; expression. It's got it's not it's not releasing itself." And you and I understood what was happening because there I was sitting in the in the church listening to ministry and I'm and I'm sitting there and I can feel the thoughts of God coming in and I want to express it and I'm sitting there thinking but this preacher can go this way and he can go that way and he could say this and and then it's eating me up and then it's the why don't you say it and no I'm I'm not I'm too good for that pulpit. That's eventually what comes to you. It's your pride standing in the way. &gt;&gt; Humble yourself and speak the word. Amen. So you got what they're pushing, the agenda they're pushing today outside of in in the message is go to these camps. Go get slain in the spirit. Go speak with tongues. Go jump up and down and scream. But are you speaking the word? Because the purpose of the day is take the book, speak the word. &gt;&gt; We've got to find that we've I believe the church needs to lead us into that. I believe the the ministry needs to lead us into that. Each one of us needs to become speakers. And yes, I know you say, you know, brother Al, I'm just a housewife. What what do I need to speak? Well, you are speaking to your children. &gt;&gt; You're speaking with your husband. You're speaking in your life. You're speaking with your friends, with your families. It's it's got to come to it now where your life is speaking, not just your words. What do I mean by life? And I'm not even talking about the codes and standards of the message. I'm talking about your joy of the word must be expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell it to your face, saints. &gt;&gt; Come on. See, it's got to be that. &gt;&gt; I I love his word. I love his word so much. I just want to share it. I want to fellowship with it. I want unending fellowship. &gt;&gt; We've got to be able to see that. not forms of religion but actual loving the word. I can't wait to wake up in the morning after my sleep. My sleep is wasting my time. You know, I want to wake up in the morning, open my coffee and read the word and and and speak to someone and express it today. You know, I that's what we want to see in the in the bride of Christ. That's what we want to see among the people. &gt;&gt; As we close this down, testimony of a true witness, paragraph 186. What church? What's the That's the reason I can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost of crying, shaking, or speaking in tongues or any sensation. You hear it straight from the prophet. &gt;&gt; They're all right now. Them things are right. But the devil can impersonate that so real. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost is deity. &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in men. It's more than a sensation. It's more than speaking in tongues. is more than shouting in the spirit. It's more than weeping. It's more than joining church. It's God living in man deity. God himself tabernacled into that person. When he can speak, it's just the same as God speaking. &gt;&gt; There's the call. He wants you to speak. That's the church of Jesus Christ. That's the way the first apostolic church went forth. Amen. That this is what it is. The prophet is saying, "I can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost of crying, shaking, speaking tongue, sensations. &gt;&gt; What I really want to see is God tabernacle deity in men speaking the word." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh Corinthians book of correction. We notice Paul could teach the Ephesians there how that before the foundation of the world, they were predestinated unto the adoption of sons of God. The Corinthians didn't know anything about that. They had have a little feeling of something, a little sensation, one this and that and the other and they depended on that. He couldn't teach them the deep things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here it is. So I think it's great that you got people that you can teach deep things. Watch this. Taking the word. The Holy Spirit can wind these great truths and anchor into the people's heart so they know where they're standing. &gt;&gt; Sensation and no sensation. prophecy or no prophecy, whatever it might be, take the word, speak the word. The prophet is telling us, what I really want to see is people you can teach the deep things to. &gt;&gt; They're not shunning it. They're willing to take it. They're not fighting against it. Seventh seal is not open. How can this be? How can this must happen in the future? Uh the church goes up in Revelations 3 and comes back in 19 and nothing in between is to the bride. They haven't received the Holy Spirit. They haven't received the Holy Ghost for this day. &gt;&gt; They have not responded to it because there's no word inside. Nothing's giving ability to even push the agenda. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; saints? &gt;&gt; Why do people feel they need sensations? Because they feel they need proof. &gt;&gt; Others around them also feel they need proof. Like I'm the minister. I need to see proof that you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's a private affair. &gt;&gt; It's between me and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But even myself now, why do I need proof? Faith doesn't need proof. &gt;&gt; I believe first and evidence follows whenever it can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I must believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. So people feel insecure, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They don't they don't understand what's going on. They feel they need proof. Their feelings are more satisfied when they see evidence, visible evidence. &gt;&gt; Why can I not be like brother so and so? You know, he's so lucky. He's got a gift. He's got this or speaking with tongues or prophesying or he dreams dreams. She sees dreams or he's he has visions. What about me? I got nothing. Right? So I I feel insecure. I feel inferior. I need something. The truth is saints, emotions and sensations could occur in in a way that reflects a true experience. It can the the reason should be that the body cannot contain the revelation that the Holy Spirit brings in you. What I'm saying to you is there should be some expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get the word, when God convicts your heart, there should be an expression. &gt;&gt; There should be an amen in your soul. And and maybe you're struggling with complex or something and you you really want to scream out, but you just maybe feel like raising your hand for now. And maybe you feel like you're a little shy that somebody is seeing you or that you're afraid that somebody is going to say something, but there's something happening inside. And then there's other people who are just boisterous, flamboyant, sanguin people who it's their character that when anything touches them, they're just jumping screaming and shouting. It's just emotions. It's it's the way they're made. They're different. It's emotions. It doesn't mean anything &gt;&gt; to what is going on inside. It's just an expression &gt;&gt; of something. &gt;&gt; But they should be an expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. That expression indicates the worship. &gt;&gt; So the reason it is so dangerous, it is because people can have reactions for the silliest of things and it's not even relevant, &gt;&gt; right? Anyone can cry because they're sorry for what they've done. &gt;&gt; That's good because if you cry and you're sorry and you apologize for what you've done and you come into church and the word convicts you and you cry, that's good. It's good that you cry. It's good that you come and say, "I'm sorry, Lord. I repent. You know, I I want to put this right. You come and tell the pastor or something. You come to the altar and and you raise your hands. It's good that you do that. It still doesn't mean anything unless you have the Holy Spirit in you directing you to the word &gt;&gt; because even a person who does not have the Holy Spirit can feel sorry for what they did. That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is and always has been about the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's the purposeful nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've had a reaction of sensations, then there must be a life of purpose that follows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I don't know if I said this here before. Most of the people who hit the ground in the Bible were demonpossessed. &gt;&gt; Those who willingly went down to the ground in the presence of the Lord rose up and their lives were never the same again. &gt;&gt; They woke up with a purpose. &gt;&gt; They didn't go back to an old lifestyle. When Moses bowed his head down because the ground he was standing on was holy and took off his shoe. When he rose up from there, he became a deliverer of a nation. He didn't go back to sheep farming on the mountain. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the prophet says God found him walking around living a life of ease. &gt;&gt; This prophet &gt;&gt; and then he meets the presence of God hits the ground in the presence of God wakes up with a purpose. &gt;&gt; So if there is an experience or there is an expression or there is some kind of experience of the Holy Ghost your life must have purpose &gt;&gt; from there on. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we need to see. It is a purposeful nature. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that saints? &gt;&gt; If you had a reaction of sensations, there must be purpose. That must be evident. &gt;&gt; Everyone can be anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the earnest. But the Holy Spirit of promise does not come upon a person willy-nilly. &gt;&gt; It comes to the elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is it has a purpose. It has a directive. It leads to something in particular. It is the beginning of the process of adoption of a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're under tutors and governors. Go read Galatians chapter 4. &gt;&gt; A son, as long as he's not come to maturity, he's just a servant &gt;&gt; and he's under tutors and governors. But then when it comes to the end, he receives the spirit of the son, not gifts. He was under gifts all the time, tutors and governors. But now when it comes to the process of adoption to take purpose &gt;&gt; to fulfill the will of the father to come into that state of adoption you have to have the holy spirit within you not an anointing the divine nature the purpose of god to fulfill the work of the father to be an heir of all things. It signifies a closing of being under tutors and governors and becoming an heir of the promise. Saints, if we have the full fullness of the word, why do we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost in operation? I'm not saying you mustn't. I'm asking you a question. You say, brother Alistister, okay, look, we got the fullness of the word now. We got the open book. Doesn't that mean we don't need the baptism of the Holy Ghost? No. You still need ability. The &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost gives ability for the present day. &gt;&gt; So that's what anointing is. It is ability. Otherwise, we're just sitting around doing nothing, &gt;&gt; right? With all this word feeding us and then sitting around doing nothing. You need anointing to incentivize you to give you direction what you what you need to do. It's like at a certain time you meet somebody, I don't know whether you use a bus stop here in Lima or wherever at the grocery store or something and somebody comes up to you and they notice something about you, something unique and they they seem to sense there's something different about you and they speak to you right there. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is important &gt;&gt; because it needs to give you ability &gt;&gt; to speak to this person, to see their soul, to sense what's going on, to speak the right word. Because you in your right mind, you're still worrying about what's happening, about the bills, about something that crashed into your car. And and right there, you're all flustered, you're confused, you're looking at a pawpaw and wondering whether you should buy it. And someone comes up and says, "Hi, I need some help. You need a baption of the Holy Ghost to put all those worries away and focus your attention because there's something calling and there must be a deep to respond. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. There always is a need for ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we don't take the ability and make it our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is his holy spirit in us which is the divine nature that leads us to it. So the word is what your soul, if you understand who you are, the word in your soul is what you are married to. This flesh and your mind is not married to that word. &gt;&gt; This flesh and this mind needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Young people &gt;&gt; because this flesh and this body and mind has different abilities. In my life, I had abilities of playing cricket, being a sportsman, doing art, playing music. You know, playing music is a very dangerous thing. If you if you have gift or play by ear, you can pick up all sorts of tunes and play it. But when you get the Holy Ghost, you're going to dedicate that gift to only his purpose. &gt;&gt; See, but without the Holy Ghost, you're just going to drift anywhere with it. &gt;&gt; Right? Those abilities need to be reigned in to be used for the purpose of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word is what your soul is married to. But this animal needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; This animal needs the anointing. And the anointing is what gives it abilities it could not ordinarily have. That's why it's important. Anyone can be anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the earnest. But the Holy Spirit of promise comes to the elect. You believe him, saints? That's why the Holy Spirit is necessary. What is the Holy Spirit then? It is the influence of the word for your day. &gt;&gt; The purposeful nature. &gt;&gt; Spirit is nature. The Holy Spirit is the influence of the word for your day. And that influence is going to cause your body and your spirit to fall in line with the word that you are married to. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's understand that we came into this flesh. Uh born in sin, shapen in iniquity, come into this world speaking lies as the prophet said. We we uh come with our own desires. We have our own ideas of things. We have our own way of doing things. We sometimes think, well, I'm just going to preach this this way and you know, people just have to accept it and uh this is how I do things. But it becomes ineffective unless the Holy Spirit is the one guiding us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand why they wrote it differently in the Bible? &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference? Do you understand the difference between the anointing and the person? &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference between the ability and the purposeful nature? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you need to know when you read the word, what it is that you have, what it is that you seek, &gt;&gt; what it is that God must give to you, what it is that you are lacking. Maybe if you have a desire in your heart to do something for the gospel, you need ability for that. And you need and God's ability is not going to be one that must bring failure. It must be a success for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're you other a lot of people also feel like I want to I want to be a preacher but there's just no gift there. I want to be a pastor but there's just no wisdom in you. I want to be a deacon but you're just a big old softy who's never going to be able to correct anybody. And yet in a time of need God can give you the Holy Ghost to fulfill that need because the word has inspired you beyond what you what abilities you have. Yes. Sometimes a big old softy can be someone who can bring good correction. &gt;&gt; God can do that. Only God can change you and people the people will recognize the spirit of God has worked in his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him saints. &gt;&gt; This is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit. The purposeful nature of God. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Let us pray. The musicians can come up. Dear heavenly father, we love you, Lord, with all that is within us. We give you praise, Lord, because you are more than more than worthy of all the praise and the glory. We love you, Lord. And yet in our our minds and our heart, Lord, we we may not be able to describe it or even to know or even define so many things about our lives. But we know one thing. You sent us a perfect word. When we look at where we've come from, we are reminded that you took us from the sheep coat. We were people that nobody knew, nobody cared for, nobody ever thought that we would amount to anything. We're still our people in this world. People pass us by. We come to this place. We are reminded we are the bride of Christ. We are the super race. We are the the elect. And then we drive around in our vehicles and go to the shopping markets and malls and nobody knows we even exist. Nobody cares. There's nothing special about us. And we look at this and we think, but Peter and Paul and those men walked around and there was such a great significance. Shouldn't there be something that we must do? Shouldn't there be something, some effect we must make on the world? Lord, we we understand. We know the time we are living in. Your word has been revealed to us. Yet, we know there are the denominations, the people on the outside. Many others would say, well, if you are the the chosen people of God, why does nobody listen to you? What are you doing for the world? How are you changing the world? And it gets to us. It convicts us. It makes us feel like we have to do something. But you know why you chose barren woman to be the woman of promise to bring forth the seed. Lord, we were barren for such a long time. We were people who could not bring forth. We were people who thought it was nothing to us and others told us that we were condemned. We came from families who cast us out and persecuted us for what we believed. But you built us up by your word. You brought us the truth. You gave us your spirit. You gave us this anointing. You gave us your word. You revealed the word to us, oh Lord. Now we stand before a world and your your spirit has shouted out to us. Go take the book, eat the book, speak the word. We know what the purpose is in this last days. Lord, I pray I pray for this church. I pray for our church. I pray for our families. my wife, my children, myself, my families, my siblings, my friends, those of us in in the message. Lord, it it looks like we're waiting for something to happen. We're preaching that something has, but it looks like we're waiting on something. It feels like we're waiting on something. And yet, Lord, you have commissioned us to do something. I pray for the young people. I pray for those who have been discouraged. I commit us all to you. Lord, I am in desperation. I am a minister. I'm a pastor of a church. But Lord, I need your guidance. I need your wisdom. I need your strength. I need to know what to do tomorrow. I need to do know what to do with my life. I need to know what to do for the next 10 years of my life. should you tarry? What must I do with your word? How can I bring this word to your people? How can I incentivize your children? How can I help to build your children up to to bring them to a place where they can speak the word fearlessly and share this wonderful truth with those around them? Lord God, I pray that you would anoint your children once again. Bring that purposeful spirit within us, Lord, that we might have direction. We might have purpose. That we might be holy even as you are holy. I want to be committed to your purpose, oh God. Not my own agenda, not my own ambitions, not my own career. I want my will to be aligned with your will. &gt;&gt; I want to have the ability to choose your will for my life's path. Lord, I don't want to walk my own way. I want to be anointed by your Holy Spirit. I want to have your Holy Spirit dwelling within me and giving me the direction I need. Lord God, I pray for all these your children bowed in your presence today. Anoint us, oh Lord. Bring us to that place where we are no longer confused, where we are not trapped by the enemy to trying to make us think that we should have some anointing for a different day. Lord, make us realize what it is that you have for us today. Bless us today, Father God, as we leave this place. Let these few simple things make things clearer for us. That we might understand, that we might follow behind the word for this day. That we might see what the anointing should be around the word that you have revealed for us. Bless the pastor of this church. Bless the people. Lord, we all need help. We all need strength to continue and we believe that you will lead us through to the very end. Bless us now, Father. We ask it in your precious name with much praise and thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. Praise be to God. Let's sing that song. Holy Spirit, thou would welcome in this place as brother Chad would come. Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit, thou art well. Come in this place. Holy Spirit, thou art well. Amen. This we stand and raise our hands. Amate Father of mercy and grace. Thou art welcome in this place. One more time. Holy Spirit now and well in this place. Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in his place. Omnipotent Father of mercy and grace. Thou art welcome [Music] in this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, we're going to sing that song again. But as we do, I think you're all thinking the same thought as me. We don't want him to be welcome in this building. We want him to be welcome in this place. When we sing it, we want to sing it. You know, the Bible says that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And remember, I remember uh uh I think it was brother Charlie Cox in his testimony. Brother Brenham had preached a series that uh brother Alistister quoted from. What is the Holy Ghost and what is the Holy Ghost given for? And during that series, Charlie Cox, he wanted to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so bad. He just couldn't break through. He would go out and walk in the woods and and and he just couldn't seem to get it. And he went to brother Brandham and he asked Brother Brandham about it. And this is in Charlie Cox's testimony. And brother, he asked him, "Why can't I seem to get it?" And brother Bham just stopped for a minute. And then he then he answered Charlie. He said, "Charlie, you know when you're out walking in the woods and praying and you know you feel that sweet presence around you." He said, "That's him. Just open your heart and let him in. That's it." Charlie said he went back the next time he went to pray and as he went on the woods and prayed, he felt that sweet presence and he says then he just opened it. He said, "I got it." Brother Ben made it so easy because it's a gift. you're repentant or baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And a gift is something given, but a gift is something that has to be received. How many want to be baptized, washed from all your own thinking and all your own ideas and separated, washed away from everything else that's carnal and everything else that I ever had and wants to receive another nature that lines up with God's nature and give our tabernacle for him to live his life inside of us. Amen. If we have that desire with all of our hearts, just open up and let that desire be known to God and let him come in and take possession of us and let him anoint us for that purpose and let him drive our lives and the purpose of his word. Amen. Let's just sing that song again. But don't make it this place. Make it this place. Amen. Let's sing that once again. be like, "Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place. Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place." A pivot father of mercy and grace. Thou are welcome in this place. [Music] Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place. Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place. A libert [Music] of mercy and grace. Thou art welcome in this place. Let's just bow our heads together as we close. Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for speaking to us of your word again, Lord. And God, I pray that you would help us, Lord, to just open our hearts to you, to surrender more than we've ever surrendered before. God, that you would give us a true revelation of your word and what you're trying to do in each one of us. And may we surrender to that purpose, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, may we catch the revelation of what you want, Lord. We want your anointing upon our lives absolutely every day. But God, we know we need more than just an anointing. We need your very person inside of us. Lord, we need you to quicken the life that you placed in us before the foundation of the world. We need you to marry to us, Lord, to be married, to be joined as one with our souls, Lord. God, we need the anointing every day of our lives, but we need the anointing to bring life, Lord. Life within us, your life inside of us, Lord. And God, I pray that you would, Lord, fill us with your spirit, that you would quicken us to life, that you would unify yourself with your attribute that's in us, and that you would abide in us, Lord. That you would take up residence in us, that we would be tabernacling deity, Lord. That the reality of the message would be alive in us. That it wouldn't be something that we just believe, but it would be something that we are, Lord. that we become one with the word. And we become the word by allowing you access to us. And God, with that, we need your anointing every day of our lives so that we can manifest your life and your purpose. God, let your spirit abide in us and on us and all around us. Inspire us, anoint us, quicken us, use us, and live your life inside of us, Lord. God, we want to surrender. We want to die out. We want to give up everything that's not holy, that's not sanctified and set aside and dedicated for your purpose. We want to die to all of that. Wash it away from us, Lord, with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, with the Holy Ghost and fire. Burn out of us every wrong desire and every wrong vision of our lives and every wrong purpose that we've gained through this world. And may you burn into us that one vision, that one purpose, that desire you had of us before the foundation of the world. May we receive it now, Lord. May you fill all your children. May you anoint anoint us for that purpose you've called us to. May we walk in that anointing and in that purpose. God, I pray that you would bless, Lord, your children. Bless our brother Alistister and his wife. God, as they continue their journey with more ministry before they go home, I pray you watch over them and use them. And may you bless them and inspire him again. And for each one of us, Lord, as we walk out of here, may we walk out, Lord, with a clear vision and understanding of what you're trying to do in this hour, what your desire is, what your heart is, and what your your heart for us is. And may it be manifest and fulfilled in each one of us. Lord, we surrender to you. We give ourselves to you. We ask for everything that was preached to be a living reality inside of us, Lord. For we surrender to that purpose. I love you, Lord. I thank you God for this message of this hour for the awakening Lord for you sharing your heart the the mystery you had of yourself in the back part of your mind and how you shared it with us because we are part of that mystery. May it become more of a reality to us every hour of the day. We love you Lord. We thank you for your love. We thank you for living in this hour when these things are possible. Lord, we thank you for a word that has washed us, for your spirit that has cleansed us, Lord, for for your presence that will fill us and live in us. God, we appreciate so much the things you've allowed us to hear. And may they become our experience, Lord. Pray your pleasant presence would be with your people as we go from here. And may this living reality grow in us day by day. Oh, we love you. We thank you. We ask your blessings over it all. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. Been such a privilege to worship God with you. Amen. It's been such a privilege to hear the word of God. Amen. But I don't want to be a hearer only. I want to be a doer. I want it to live inside of me. Amen. God bless you for the bless. &gt;&gt; Just sing that one more time. Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place. Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place. All inent father of mercy and grace. Thou are welcome in this place. Lord in thy presence and the Lord in thy presence is healing. [Applause] No other power can save Lord my life. Holy Spirit, thou are welcome in this place. You are welcome [Music] in this place and fill up the hungry and empty within. Restore us, oh father, revive us again. Holy Spirit, thou art welcome in this place. Now our world in this place. [Music]
