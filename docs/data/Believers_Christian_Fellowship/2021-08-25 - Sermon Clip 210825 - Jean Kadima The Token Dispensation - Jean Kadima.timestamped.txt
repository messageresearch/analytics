[0:00] is it the time of grace we're living in
[0:03] yes is the time of grace
[0:05] is it the time of judgment we're living
[0:08] in
[0:08] yes is the time of judgment
[0:11] is this the time of judgment
[0:15] and time of grace
[0:17] overlapping
[0:21] goshen is in egypt technically
[0:24] goshen
[0:25] is in laodicea
[0:28] technically goshen
[0:31] is in egypt the bride is technically in
[0:35] laodicea
[0:37] the bride is not in laodicea because
[0:41] she's in the goshen
[0:43] and goshen is a position in christ
[0:47] goshen is not a location
[0:51] but goshen is a position
[0:55] both
[0:56] coexist we are in laodicea
[1:01] and we are not in love odyssey
[1:04] it depends on what
[1:07] where you placing everything
[1:10] is that right
[1:14] and that goes with everything that i'm
[1:18] talking about
[1:19] same thing with the blood
[1:22] when moses got the children of israel
[1:25] from egypt
[1:27] there was no blood in egypt
[1:30] well there was blood in egypt
[1:33] because there was blood in goshen
[1:38] grace and judgment
[1:40] coexist
[1:43] it now depends on what side are you in
[1:48] what side are you in
[1:52] because the grace and judgment both
[1:56] exist
[2:00] and this is what happened in the token
[2:03] uh dispensation
[2:08] are we
[2:09] in a time of judgment
[2:15] yes we are in a time of judgment because
[2:17] the lion of the tribe of judah
[2:21] has shown up up there
[2:25] is that right
[2:27] no
[2:28] we can say we are not in the time of
[2:31] judgment
[2:34] because we still have access to the
[2:36] blood
[2:39] so the blood is still with us
[2:43] but it is in goshen
[2:47] with the
[2:48] bride is that right
[2:51] so the blood is with
[2:53] the bride
[2:55] and is negotiation
[2:57] so if you want the blood
[3:00] you can say
[3:02] are we in a time of judgment i would say
[3:04] yes
[3:06] because the darkness is everywhere in
[3:08] egypt
[3:10] the darkness is is now loud this year
[3:15] it's a total chaos
[3:19] but yet there is a group of people
[3:22] that still have access to that blood
[3:26] they still have access to the light
