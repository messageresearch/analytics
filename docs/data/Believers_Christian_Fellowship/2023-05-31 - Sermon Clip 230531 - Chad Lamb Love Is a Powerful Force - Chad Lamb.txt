========================================

the love of God didn't make the Hornets an enemy they didn't make the Hornet something to be hated they made the Hornet something to be sympathized with and pitied and loved my goodness this is Light Years Beyond human this is not human amen this is not our efforts this is not us trying to be loving you can try to be loving all you want amen but at some point it's going to break it's going to fizzle amen your love the human love is not strong enough to handle some of these circumstances but oh praise God something changed something happened in a moment's time the whole atmosphere Chained and brother Ben instead of being angry and afraid he was loving and had sympathy and began to apologize to Hornets apologize to a bull I say God that's the love that I need but that's the power that I believe is shed abroad in our hearts but I believe it's there but listen what brought love to the Forefront it was the obstacle that brought love to the Forefront what was it that displayed the love of God it was the need for the love of God it was the great adversity that produced the great love we think of all these trials and these Temptations and the difficult things we go through we look at them as bad things they're not bad things they're good things friends we absolutely need them amen because the promises are to them that overcometh how will you read how will you receive the promise if you don't overcome how will you overcome with no trial and then how will the love of God be expressed amen if your human love is enough to carry you through every circumstance and you can retain your emotions and you can hold back your fear and all of these things you can do yourself how will the love of God ever be expressed no I'm telling your friends the love of God will be expressed when we've gone beyond human amen beyond the ability when the situation is so serious and so intense and so fearful and so dangerous amen that there's no way a human being can endure that's when something will happen [Music] I wonder many times that that's why brother Branham says you wait till this Council Begins the title you wait for these things then you'll see what you've seen temporarily manifest in fullness of power not because human beings are going to be able to do it but because the circumstance will get to the situation where nothing else can do but the the but the perfect love of God producing the third pool not a human brain not human emotions not we finally got ourselves to Perfection we will never get ourselves to Perfection it'll be the love of God being perfected within us and we've seen it here it's been displayed to us amen and and I thank God now that we know we don't have to produce him we don't have to fake anything we don't have to work anything up we don't have to keep trying and trying and trying there's no trying to produce this amen the only thing we're trying to do is surrender more surrender more surrender more so that he can take a greater portion of me and feed more on the word and stay in the washing of the water of the word so that it can get more of me out of me so in times of trouble there's something planted deep within me that could come to the Forefront I can't produce this all I can do is open myself up and say God I need more of you I need you to lead me further into your love
