Christ and everybody would say amen and amen God bless you all you can uh uh be seated for a while amen and it's good to be back here I was here uh if I'm not mistaken sometime in the middle of 2019 and I thank the Lord uh first and foremost for giving me and my wife again the opportunity to be here I think it was a midweek service when I was here last uh uh January of 2019 just before the pandemic and uh I never thought that we can travel again because of this Global thing but uh the Lord is gracious and we had uh brother Chad and Brother Kyle in the Philippines in the beginning of the year and we were blessed and to see them once again and we were talk Talking me and brother CH in uh because I was you I was in uh in Canada uh June and he invited me to be here but things did not work out I was with my daughters and they they didn't have the the the Visa going to the us so we have to cancel the trip and just make another trip to go here and uh I'm glad that things worked out and I had uh we had the opportunity to be with uh brother Chad again in his family in the church and I'm so thankful for the kindness the hospitality uh sister Angie and uh brother Chad they're always I I know that every visitor that they have they make make them special but I know that I'm also special for them and uh we also have this opportunity how to spend time with the family of bar Kyle s and it was also a special day and to last yesterday was also a special day because I I was able to spend time with the the young people during the de the devotion time and of course this is the most special day because it's our anniversary with my wife and you know and you know sometimes um every time I hear a testimony on about an uh couples having their anniversary they would say I thank the Lord for giving me a wonderful wife a perfect wife so sounds so ideal but I thank the Lord that God gave me not a perfect wife and I am not a perfect husband but we have a perfect God that put us together for the last 35 years of our life and the Bible said that we are given 70 years and if by reason of strength we reach 80 so I've spent all already half of my lifetime with my wife and I don't regret it a bit I've learned so many things in fact when I was gathering my thoughts uh the inspiration that I got uh to share this morning is about uh the experiences experiences that I had with my wife I mean so many humbling experiences I thought I would control the family I thought I would teach him so many things but God has allowed so many humbling experiences in my life learning and learning and learning and maybe I'll keep on learning until we reach the age of 70 or 80 or whoever goes first amen but I'm thankful that the Lord has given me uh we we were blessed with four children uh we have already two grandkids and U uh we I just thank the Lord for all this the things that has God has given us for the first seven years of our married life we were not yet believers and I was baptized when during our uh in my in our seventh year of being husband and wife a few months later she got baptized and we had two more daughters uh I mean we had two sons when I we became Believers and we had two more daughters and they grew up in the message and looking back looking back I would say that our relationship my my relationship with my wife is not a perfect relationship we had our ups and downs and more Downs than ups but we we thank the Lord because it was through those experience that we had in our life that we learned to love each other more to compliment each other and we we realize that without God in our relationship we might have divorced or separated in our younger years but now we continue to be together and I think that is something that we should be thankful about 35 years not very long compared to the older couples that are here but it is not very short either compared to the younger couples that are here we are in the middle of the road and the prophet said we should stay in the middle of the road amen so that's message based amen so I'm just thankful and of course sister Isel being here with us one of our young people in our church before she went to the US and it's such a privilege to see her once again she was in the Philippines last year for a short vacation and my wife was communicating with her uh for the possibility for her to come here and I was glad that uh she was here meeting um she met brother Chad before in the Philippines and now she met the the family of brother Chad so uh I'm praying and hoping that uh one day she will decide to be here in the church to transfer here no so but I recommended her uh recommended to her that it would be a good thing to have a fellowship uh with with fellow Believers and especially with pastors that I know that has called but has been called by the Lord so I uh uh I really pray that uh things will work out for her and of course um I'm thankful uh seeing Brother Kyle again we have been I think the last time we were together was uh I mean in the mission field was in Cambodia in 2019 and I was telling him that at this end of the month I'll be going back there because they resumed their camp meeting and uh this church you may not know it and maybe I'll discuss it later this afternoon you have this church have helped a lot in the mission work in the not only in the Philippines but in Asia Southeast Asia these countries and uh we may not be able to report everything that this church has done uh through the not only through the financial help but also to the prayers and the support and the ministry but you will never know until eternity comes and we will be talking about it the things that we have done and maybe some of uh the people that were reached uh uh in those countries they will approach you when we are in heaven and they will thank you for the that you gave because of that they they knew the Lord they heard the message and now they are in the message amen so today uh I I just want to to give a little bit of encouragement to us and as I mentioned uh my topic for today is humbling experiences that God allows in our life sometimes we this is the experience that we don't want to have we always want to have good experiences the best best experiences of life but it's I I believe it is part of our character molding that God allows this kind of experiences and you may be uh Liv uh in the message for the last 50 years of your life or maybe for the Last 5 Years of your life but make no mistake all of us even the ministers we will have experiences in our life that will uh be directed to us so God can humble us because there's always a human tendency that when we accomplish something when we achieve something in our life we always tend to to be puffed up to think that we are better than the others and some will say oh I'm not like that I'm very humble then that means that you are not humble because you are arrogant right so let me read first the scriptures and if I can invite you once again before we continue uh I'd like to read three parts of the scriptures Book of Psalms chapter 18 we'll be reading from uh verse 31 and verse 32 Book of Psalms chapter 18 verse 31 and 32 he said here for who is God save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God it is God that Garth me with strength and make my way perfect amen and in the in chapter 75 of the book of Psalms chapter 75: 5 to 7 it says here lift not up your horn on high in other words don't be arrogant speak not with a stiff neck for promotion comes neither from the East nor from the West nor from the South but God is the judge he puts down one and set up another so it's the Sovereign will of God right and the third uh scripture I would like to read in 2 Corinthians chapter uh 3 2 Corinthians chapter 3 we'll be reading two verses verse 5 and verse 6 Paul was writing to the Corinthians and said not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also had made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life amen so all these words amen that we have read from the book of Psalms to the book of 2 Corinthians it's basically teaching us to be humble it's basically teaching us that our sufficiency is not in ourselves not in our capabilities or our intellect it is everything is from the Lord amen now let me read to you a a portion of the the message message this is the title of the message was washing jesus' feet he said when a man thinks that is just a little bit better than somebody else you're on the road out my brother that is what is saying we are all the same in the sight of God rich or poor brown or black white or yellow whatever we may be we are all one on on on one equal basis with God there's no racial discrimination or differences the sight of God anyway after all we all came from the lineage of Noah right after the flood okay but people have the tendency to to separate themselves from one another people have the tendency to categorize uh uh their their their way of living and of course we we have different cultures we came from different countries and sometimes I can even see that in message churches that if you go to certain I'm not referring to this this church but sometimes I had the experience of go getting to message churches and and you can sense the the spirit of superiority see and these are message Believers waiting for the Rapture like you and me but I said they need to be born again they have to realize that in in God's sight we are all on equal basis am and in the in the church age book God the prophet said God's will for us is perfect Perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God Waiting for God Amen and this is the process of character development so when God allows humbling experience in our life this is for our own character development and sometimes people learn the easy way sometimes people learn the hard way some people doesn't learn at all see these are three kinds of people see but e i I would either learn the EAS way than the hard way but God will allow things to happen in our life to shake us from what we think we are to shake us from what we think we know and start yielding oursel to God one time I I I preached the message in our church Divine assignment we have a a Divine assignment from the Lord and what is a Divine assignment i i i defined it in my own terms I said a Divine assignment is doing what God wants you to do going where God wants you to go and being what God's want you to be it's not about yourself it's about God and his plan for our life see so humbling experience and and when when we Define humbling experience these are unusual events or situation or condition that God allows in our life to to to disrupt the normal routine that we have because normally if you you you keep on doing things every day you live a regimented life do it becomes your comfort zone and the next step you become self-sufficient overconfident and then you become arrogant and then you tend to look down at people that cannot do what you're doing cannot say what you're saying cannot think what you're thinking and you feel Superior over them and so God will allow circumstances in our life to to Humble us no matter what age you are whether you're in school uh a young professional or even the older people the humbling experience that not does not stop in a certain stage of our life it goes on and on and on and I I cannot even count the many humbling experience that God allowed to happen in my life before I became a minister during the time that I'm a minister even in the present and I am looking forward to more humbling experience because there's so much of us so much in US I mean that that God has to strip away until we learn learn to yield ourselves to the Lord and we we and then we can understand that it is not because of us but because of the go of the god that is living in us now I you know you know I love to hear testimonies of people uh um s how they came to know the Lord not only for message Believers but even for denominational Christians and one time I I came across a testimony of the former heavyweight champion of the world because I love boxing I was a amateur boxer when I was young and this this former heavyweight champion of the world his name was George foran he was the Olympic champion for representing the United States uh in 1968 and in 1973 he was able to to get the championship from his smoking Joe Fraser amen so he was he was 64 in height weighing 250 lb and he pack a knockout punch and he always say he wants to finish his opponent in the first two rounds he doesn't want uh to have a long period because he gets tired easily so he was he he was so gifted in in in punching people right I don't know if that's even a gift but uh that was his gift he said that he was that he was good at that and so uh after being a champion in 1973 he he defended this title for two times and the third time that he will defend this uh uh his title was in 1974 and he fought muhamad Ali I don't know if you you know these people but I know them very well because I always watched their games before and in 1974 in in in in in Africa they fought and George Foreman was very confident that he will beat uh Muhammad Ali who was older who was smaller who was lighter than him he was so full of confidence but here is Muhammad Ali had made a strategy to beat George Foreman then after that after that fight we know that he lost the fight he lost the title and it was uh he was young and he was he was uh I mean uh when he lost the fight he got depressed he it went on a little bit and in 1977 he fought his last fight losing to a uh nobody in the boxing world it was not even known I even forgot his name and so during after the fight he went to the to the locker room and according to his testimony he he got a Epiphany a religious Epiphany in other words he he there was an experience that the the the Holy Spirit to took a hold of him and he got born again from a boxer now he became a Believer amen and the next years that happened in the next few years uh he was attending a church and he became eventually he became a preacher from a boxer to a preacher all right and if your pastor is a is a former boxer and you know people will just obey the pastor right okay so so here is George foran now then he he said it it took a humbling experience for him to know the Lord without because he was so full of Pride he was popular he had this reputation of being a good boxer and God has to strip everything away amen it took a humbling experience for him and so when he did that when that thing happened to him he starts serving the lord he became a preacher and many years later he'd go back to the ring and and fight and God uh uh allowed him I don't know what uh if that is good or not but I mean he allowed him to be Champion again at the age of 45 and there was a part of his testimony he said when he was young he will he will fight and try to finish the game for the first two rounds but when he got older in This heavyweight championship that was that happened in 1994 he said he was he had a lot of patience he was waiting and waiting and waiting he was he was telling this in a testimony in one of the churches and he was waiting and waiting and waiting not unlike when he was younger that he was he always he was so aggressive but this time he's waiting and waiting waiting for the right time and then when he he saw the right time and bum and a knockout he became the oldest heavyweight champion of the world at the age of 45 now I while I was looking at it you we can apply that in our spiritual life When We Were Young we are so aggressive we think that we can do so many things according to our abilities according to our intellect according to what we want but when we get older in serving the lord we learn to wait we we learn to wait on God we learn to wait for God there's a timing and we realize that it's not our sufficiency God is our sufficiency the only way that that we can we can we can accomplish anything even in I'm a minister for for 25 years uh when I was young I thought that I could I've been accomplishing things for the Lord but then I realized that as I got older without the grace of God without his leading without his anointing without his inspiration no nobody can be blessed in the ministry that the Lord has entrusted me and every time I think that the people are blessed in the word that I preach they are not blessed but every time that I feel that I did not do my job well somebody will approach you and they will say that they were blessed and you know that you know that it was not you because you know in yourself that you you're not even sure of what you preaching and so this this this testimon this humbling experience that the Lord gives us it is part of our learning in life amen the the and this learning will will give us a much I mean uh much um perspective in in the life that we are living and some of the uh humbling experience that we have sometimes it it's like a in a secular job you think that you're uh doing well and you know that you have an expert and somebody gets promoted ahead of you that is a humbling experience see if you lose your job you lose a property uh or maybe you lose your influence to others that is a humbling experience we have a uh a brother in our church when we started we started in our church 1995 we were employees of the hotel different departments we were all together we were serving the lord and after 5 years this brother he just wanted to stop serving the lord and he he was not um going to the direction that he will do evil things but he just wanted to focus in his career and he did that for the next 20 years of his life from from year 2000 to year 2020 but in those years he was very successful he was able to travel the whole world he was he got promoted he became uh he he he was able to get this High position in the companies that he was working for but in 2018 he had a kidney failure because of sugar diabetes and he started having this uh what they call this the dialysis and it was the time that uh he remembered that he left the Lord and so two years later in 2020 during the pandemic he was contacting one of our brothers in church and he said he wanted to go back to church because everything is on a lockdown he was asking if we still have church and so uh he started he started attending the church and his prayer was not to get healed although he believed that he can get healed but his prayer was he wanted uh his relationship with God to be restored and I think that's a good prayer amen and he he he called me he said pastor I'm not here uh uh to ask prayers from you that I will be healed I want to restore my relationship with the Lord and his his body was slowly deteriorating uh uh in 2021 he got his feet got amputated in 2022 one eye is blind after a few months one ear is cannot hear anymore and the veins where they put the needle is not is not functioning anymore so slowly and slowly his body is deteriorating all the internal organs are being affected and in in July 2023 this year he called me up one Friday he said I have decided Pastor to stop my dialysis and I I am not a medical practitioner but I know that if you stop dialysis uh it will take 3 days more or more a little bit more and then you get you have this sepsis or blood poisoning and then you die and I said are you sure that you are doing that and said I'm so tired and the reason I'm not committing suicide is said I'm now ready I have I I have uh my relationship with the Lord was restored and I just wanted to go home to the Lord he was so tired physically but he was so happy uh that uh his relationship with the Lord and after all this humbling experience that he had he just wanted to go home to the Lord and so uh we spent a few more days and he died but he died happy he died he was ready and I was contemplating back on the conversation that we had in the last week of his life he said how how he needed those humbling experience in life that if not for those experiences he he he would not have gone back to the Lord he was just the same age as mine 58 so he not very old he's not very young but I mean he has lots of things to do if he still he was still alive but but he reached to a a point in his life that After experiencing all these things in his life he realized how important the most important thing is not uh the money that he made the position that he handled the the the property that he acquired but what is more important is the restoration of his relationship with the Lord and I think it is a lesson for me and a lesson for many people that uh we have to rearrange our priorities in life sometimes you will think that you are a father that you are in control of your family and one day you will have an argument that may cause uh a divorce from your wife or maybe a children she children that rebel against you I me as a pastor I have I have so many uh humbling experiences that sometimes in my young AG I will preach in a way that for me I'm not condemning the people but because uh everything is good in our family everything is good in my in my Ministry I I I'm projecting something that condemns the people people not convicting them and then God will allow experiences in my life my life to Humble me and I started apologizing in the Pulpit they didn't know what I did but uh uh I would not say secretly but in my heart I know there's some arrogance in the way I preach but as I get older and older and older I realize that I I have nothing to brag about everything that can preach it's because by the grace of God you can be a fiery preacher jump up and down shout here shout there it has no effect on the people see but you can speak slowly and in a small a low tone voice but if it's coming from a sincere heart it affects the people it transforms the lives of the people so it's not about how articulate you are how knowled knowledgeable you are in the message it's always about your life it's always about your life the way you project it the way you you speak the way you think uh it will you will catch the spirit you don't know me you don't know my background in the Philippines but I cannot hide the spirit that is in me you you are you are message Believers you will discern it and you catch it and sometimes you may say there's something off in this person he he speaks well he's good he looks good but something's not right you know why because there's a spirit hiding see and we are believer we are given the the spirit of discernment Amen to to to to to discern the spirits amen so now let's let's let's move on a little bit and we will just look at some of the scriptures where God gave uh humbling experience to the characters of The Bible we start with in the books in the book of Acts chapter 9 it says here this is the conversion of Saul and it said and soul yet breathing out threatenings chapter 9 verse 1 of a book of Acts he said and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem as he and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and there suddenly there shined round about him a light from Heaven he fell to the Earth God knows how to put you down right he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying soul soul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecute persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the the priests now this was uh the reaction of Soul he said and he trembling and astonished said Lord Lord what will thou have me to do I think that's the best response if God gives us a humbling experience our our reaction should be Lord what do you want me to do Lord why is this happening to me not in the form that you're questioning the sovereignty of God but you want to know why this happened to us and sometimes it's almost uh a question the prophet preached about a whole message and the title is why see all of us are always asking the question why why does this has to happen to me I'm not doing anything bad I'm doing I'm serving the lord I've been in the message for many years and all of a sudden these things seemingly negative will happen to us and we ask the Lord why and I think it is just normal to ask why but we have to realize that God is a sovereign God and he knows what he wanted to do in our life to develop our character in the message uh I think is the message is uh the title is message respects he said God God's uh um let me find the C he said we cannot question God we just have to respect because we he knows what he's doing for us and what he is doing for us is always the best for us and we may not may may not understand it for the in our whole lifetime and as I always say to our church God is not obligated to explain to us everything that is happening to us we just have to learn to trust him to believe in him that he's in full control but sometimes it's easier said than done when you're in that kind of situation there's always a tendency to ask God to be depressed to to to have a wounded Spirit but see God knows what's best for us he's just giving us these experiences so we may learn amen that we are not sufficient in our s and so we we we know that this happened to Paul uh to Saul and they became po right and now he was able it didn't stop there even in the in in the in his ministry you would think that after God has humbled him called him used him that all will be well in his life but that's that was not the case see and in in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 12 which is a familiar verse to all of us brother Brandon preached a whole message about this perfect strength and perfect witness he said in verse 7 first Corin 2 Corinthians 12:7 he said lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a torn In the Flesh the messenger of Satan to BU me lest I should be exalted above me ass sure for this thing I besought the Lord Christ he doesn't want this turn in the flesh we do not want a turn in the flesh nobody is praying Lord give me a turn in the flesh you cannot read in a prayer request that there's a brother or a sister requesting for a torn In the Flesh see we all all always we want to that God will remove the torn In the Flesh and even Paul himself he he besought the Lord Christ that it might depart part from him and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness and you see as long as we are weak in ourselves the Lord is strong in ourselves amen we we cannot get away from that God will always give us this weakness this vulnerability so we'll always depend on God we know the life of Moses he was trained for 40 years the prophet said it took 40 years to drill that education to Moses and took another 40 years to drill that out from Moses and I was I was asking why would the Lord allow education for Moses Egyptian education for 40 years and after 40 years he will spend another 40 years just to strip that away he could get directly to the next 40 Years of his life but God was doing something he was teaching Moses not to rely on man's knowledge you see there's a vast difference between knowledge and wisdom knowledge you can learn it from the school you can you can learn it from somebody training you and teaching you but wisdom you only get wisdom through experience through experience without the experience you will have all the knowledge in the world but wisdom you have to have experience you have to age so sometimes I'm telling my young people you think you know best because you have technology and everything right and that is true because the prophet said said this the next generation will become wiser but they will become weaker right that is the rec C of the Prophet they become wise they become they they have this technology but they're weaker H in physical because everything is automated right in our uh in in the days of the olden times Everything's manual there's no Comfort see those in my age bracket would know that those who are older than me would know better see but it but it it it it gives you something in your character if you are training to be to uh if you're under training let's say in a military training they give you all this this physical uh training and everything so when you are in battle your body can cope can adopt with with the things with the with the with the negative things that could happen in a b Battlefield and sometimes if we are too comfortable God will give us this humbling experience so that we may know that God is God and he's sufficient and we are not and so here's Moses first 40 years second 40 years everything was stripped and after 40 years uh I mean at the age of 80 God said I can now use you before God cannot use him all of his abilities God cannot use him and and I like this this quote he said in the message perfect strength by Perfect witness he said there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire not our desire but God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if you ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of that thing and lay it aside that God can use us we all always say in our in our prayers in our uh when we testify we want God to use us but unless we Master the thought of human ability God can never use us God does not use us because of our ability God does not use us because of our intelligence he may use it uh but he has to give us a humbling experience now so uh we will not be relying relying on our own thoughts when I was a young preacher I I had I had so many there's no tablet yet before for and I have so many notes and before I preach I lost my my my notes so I don't know how what will I preach but what that is that is one of the best preaching that I had without notes because it was not me preaching it was God preaching to the people see but sometimes if you you come to the pull pit so prepared so many codes and so many scriptures and so many This and like that and then you realize that you get confused sometime you don't know what to say that's why I I I when I when when I teach our younger brothers in church hoping that they will be preachers someday I always tell them when you preach do not intend to to impress the people you do not preach to impress you preach so that they will be blessed and I said never ever preach the people to entertain them because some preachers can be preaching a good message but their motive and objective is just to impress the people that they know more than the people and sometimes they put a lot of you know entertainment but the prophet said the pulpit is not a place for entertainment you do not clown around right it is a serious thing because this is the nearest place Between Heaven and Earth and the angel in the Pulpit as we were talking with brother Chad is this is something uh it is a this is a message for you directly from God and and the prophet said we have to make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we got to make a complete surrender soul body and spirit you know and sometimes it's easy to say that we will surrender but it takes almost a lifetime to fully surrender ourselves I can I can be honest to you this morning that I have not fully surrendered all aspects of my life and I believe I believe that it will take a lifetime for you for to you for you to totally surrender everything every faculties of your mind your heart your body and the only time that you can fully surrender is the day you die because you cannot do anything anymore see but until we are living there's this uh sticky nature brother calls it a carnal nature that is in you and if you read Romans chapter 6 chapter 7 there's something in us that wants to do bad things the evil things and this is the flesh not your inner man not your not your the the spirit of God that is in you but this flesh that's why we do not hug Brothers we do not hug sisters right because the pro the prophet said if we are healthy there's always a sensation that will happen no matter how old or young you are see so we have to be very very careful on these things now let me bring you to 1st Chronicle chap 26 uh this is the story of a king that God has blessed and and brother vam referred to him in he was preaching the message influence 2 Chronicles chapter 26 this is King Uzziah let me read to you the first verse until the 5ifth verse this is how we start started sometimes a Believer would would start right in his walk with God but will end up wrong he said then all the people of Judah took Uzziah who was 16 years old and made him King in the room of his father Amah he built eloth and restored it to Judah after that the King slept with his fathers 16 years old was Uzziah when he began to rain see he was just a teenager a young people and he reigned 52 years in Jerusalem his mother's name also was jaia of Jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord what a good start he was always doing good in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father Amah did and he sought God this is the second thing that made him great first he was doing the right things in the sight of God second he was always seeking God in the days of Zechariah the prophet who had understanding in the visions of God and as long as he sought the Lord God made him to prosper so there's the secret of prosperity seek the Lord do things right in the sight of God but you know when people start when God starts blessing people or blessing a church or or blessing a uh a career of a certain person human tendency not only for unbelievers for also but also of our Believers there we tend to forget the source of our blessings it's it's true in the Philippines it's true in the United States it's true in Pakistan it's true in every part of the world see I I I have members in our church that they will say l uh Pastor pray for me that the Lord will bless my career and I will pray for them and after you pray for them he said they they will they will leave the church and there was a there there was a a member in our church before he said I mean he he God the Lord prospered him and he was saying I will not give any money that I earned to the church but when he has no money was asking me to pray for him but when I prayed for him God bless him he thought I was asking for the money see that is how the Satan can easily get into your mind that you think you achieve this thing because you're good you're great right but it's not the case and so Uzziah he was successful in war he was successful in his Works he became famous he had architecture he had military might and all these things and he had so many people so many weapons in his Armory and then in verse 16 he said but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction and when your heart is lift lifted up you tell to do things beyond your calling and this is what Uzziah did he it it took the place of the priest you know the story amen he burned incense which was not supposed to be done by a king and here's the thing when he did that azarah the priest verse 17 went in after him and with four score priests and the Lord that were Valiant men and they with stod Uzziah he was trying to correct the king because they know as priests in the temple of God the king cannot do that but instead of uh Uzziah uh heeding to the correction what he did was he got angry he got angry he doesn't want to be corrected you know when you when we come to a certain point that we don't want to be corrected we want don't want to be uh we we we fail to become teachable then that's the start of our end because we are we should be ever learning somebody has to correct us somebody's we need to be accountable to somebody so you can see a lot of Believers in the whole world that they can they want to to to to attend churches they want to stream different but they don't want to sit down in a church to be under a pastor because they don't want to be corrected right and once they are corrected they start leaving the church look for another church and when they start being corrected in the church that they transfer to they look for another church as the prophet said they travel from Pillar To Post and the the latter part of their spiritual life they would think that they are the only ones who are saved it's always that it's it has been always that way because they don't want to be corrected and most of the time I'm most of this my my experience most of the time those people who were blessed financially materially physically they are the ones that don't want to be corrected that's my experience I'm not again I'm not referring to you uh I I hope that if we are blessed we can still stand correction we can still accept correction because the pastor in the Pulpit is Anointed by God to correct the things not because he's perfect not because he's perfect but he was ordained to do so amen whether you are older or younger or the same age as your pastor it is the responsibility of the pastor and now the question on the floor arise who corrects the pastor God corrects the pastor you do not correct your pastor it will be the other way it is a wrong process every time I make a mistake God gives me a humbling experience and you will not be you will not want to be in my place because any humbling experience that the Lord gives you the past is so painful am it's so painful that's my experience it's so painful you you cannot you cannot have that arrogant spirit and it is a lesson in life that uh God will correct the ministers because we were ordained to correct the people so God will correct us and if he if he will not handle it quite well then ministers can also be arrogant see and that's the end of the ministry of any person and so here we see Uzziah the king he died with Leprosy which is a type of sin he never stopped and or humbled himself with what happened instead he thought he was still the king he can do what he wants to do and you know some people are like that they think that they can do what they want to do without anybody correcting them so we always need a headship amen if you are single you have the headship of your father if you are believers you have the headship of our pastor the ministers they have the W headship of Christ right it's all it always boil boils down to headship yes sir but if you fail to see that we need the headship who can correct us I my my pastor he he has been here and think in July brother neor he was my pastor when I was 13 Even though I a pastor he's a pastor ahead of me I always still submit myself to him just to make sure that I'm accountable to somebody else that somebody can correct me any time anywhere if he sees that I'm doing something wrong or I or if I'm going in a different direction he has the authority to do it to me and I will not be offended because I need that I need that and sometimes you cannot even see eye to eye on the things or or matters but it really doesn't affect me because I believe believe that is the authority that the Lord has given me see so it takes a humble heart to accept that there's somebody for you and and I I Marvel in the people that when I ask them who shared to you the message it was God who shared to me the message no person one day he was just sleeping he woke up he saw the message that is that is a lie that's not true see or or somebody will say I was just sitting somewhere I I saw a spoken word booklet I read it and then lo and behold I became a Believer see but that's not true God has to use somebody God has to use a man to put that spoken word in that place God has to give some tapes or some uh uh preaching of the Prophet so still God uses a man but sometimes people are so arrogant that they don't want to give credit to any people that God used for them to hear the message I feel I believe that is that is something that we should be taken away from us used to always uh look to somebody not to look up to somebody but to acknowledge that the that that God who wants to call us can use people around us amen because it humbles us I was sharing to brother Chad that the brother who who who who shared to me the message he was my subordinate when we were in the military service he was my subordinate when you were working in the private company and he became my pastor now can you imagine that the things that I had to to humble myself he always he doesn't call me sir he calls me he doesn't call me brother he calls me sir when he he rebukes me he calls me sir but I have to follow him and I said yes sir but I have to pass because God knows my character he could have used somebody else brother nessar was our pastor and this brother younger brother he ordained it he became a pastor for the next seven years and God was using him to to mold a character in me and I'm thankful for those times because otherwise I could have been uh more arrogant that I am right now see but God is is gracious he's mindful to you and me see and now there's another King by the name of Josiah now see the difference here in second chapter in 2 Kings chapter 22 this was the the reign of Josiah he said verse one Josiah was 8 years old when he began to rain so he's 8 years younger than Uzziah when he became a king he said and one uh his mother's name was Juda and the daughter the daughter of adaa of boscat and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord so same testimony they started right they did what is right in the sight of the Lord and they walked all the way of David his father and he turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and it came to pass in the 18th year of King Josiah that the king of the king sent shapan the son of aelia the son of misham described to the house of the Lord saying go up to hilia the high priest that they may sum the silver which is brought unto the house of the Lord which the keepers of the door of gathered of the people so his mandate at this time was to rebuild the Temple s money talk to the high priest rebuild the Temple and while were they were in the process of rebuilding the temple hilia the high priest found the book the the the book of law he said and when he found the book of law he brought it to shaan the Scribe and brought it to the king and the King said read the book of Law and when he heard the book of law being being read to him he found out that they were not not following the book of the law they were guilty of disobeying God's Will and their time and there's judgment that goes with it and so here is here now is uh Josiah right and uh uh as a king he ordered the whole Kingdom he rent his clothes ordered the kingdom to to fast and to to seek the the wisdom from hula the prophet so you here you see the character of the king he goes to the high priest he goes to the Scribe he goes to the prophetes he wants to know the will of God he had the right reaction and when uh when Josiah I mean the prophetes who the the prophetes was saying that this will be the Judgment for your people because you did not obey the law right but here in verse 19 he said uh chapter 22: 19 he said because thine heart was tender referring to Josiah and thou was humbled thyself before the Lord when thou he heard what I spake against this place and against the inhabitants there thereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and the rent thy clothes and web before me I also have heard Thee sayth the Lord so you see the vast difference from King Uzziah and King Josiah when he was corrected he got angry Uzziah but Josiah when he heard the book of the law he felt the correction he humbled himself and the Bible said there was no other king like him he destroyed the the high places idolatry they even uh uh uneed the the pre the the the Boreal of the priests that were that led the people to idolatry they burned their bones he was so mad at the the idolatry that the the people the the earlier uh their forefathers have done why because he wanted to please God he humbled himself it was not an easy thing because during that time uh Israel was doing idolatry it was also already their lifestyle and you can imagine imine if you are the king of a country that's that's already gone far far away from the Lord you will not be very popular but he has to follow God rather than man he obeyed God he he he he he followed God in all his ways thinking and believing that he can please God which he really pleased God right and so basing on the story of these two kings like Paul like Moses they were stripped from what they think they know here are two kings right they were given the opportunity to Humble themselves and now we are always given the opportunity to Humble ourselves every single day of our life if you will just be sensitive there's always something that is humbling us am things maybe small things that God is putting in on in front of us so that he can humble Us in every step of the way but sometimes uh we are so ignorant not to to to be sens not to be sensitive in these things and we fail to Humble ourselves so if we cannot be humbled by small things God will give us big things right right it's not a threat it's the reality he gives us some not because he hates us but because God loves us that when we reach the finish line of our spiritual journey our Earthly Journey we are fully humbled in front of the Lord and we can tell the Lord we can say lord it's not me it's always you all the way all along the way it was always God we we we have not done anything so big that we can get all the credit for it see I remember uh brother lonie Jenkins when he was in in in the Philippines he was there one time 1997 and we were having a dinner and after the dinner we had coffee we were working in the hotel and he said uh it is words of wisdom he said there were Sundays that I will preach and the people will be very very blessed they will send me give me a phone call give me a card thanking me because they were blessed and the next Sunday the very next Sunday nobody will be blessed not a single one and I get disappointed he said I got disappointed because I thought I didn't do a good job and then the Lord spoke to his heart he said it's not you you have to experience these things because if every Sunday someone will approach you oh Pastor oh brother we were blessed we were blessed we were blessed it gets to your head right so sometimes it's good that nobody will say they were blessed because you realize that it's not you that's right it's not you it's always good to give compliments to people but if you like getting more compliments than giving compliments that's a dangerous thing so it's better to do things on the sides don't make it known don't don't don't make it public we are living in the days of social media that everything we do every not you but not me and not you but some people uh many people all around the world the especially everything that they will do they'll post it in Facebook they'll post the food that they ate they they they will post how they look after they wake up it's nonsense but they want to display everything because people want to be recognized it is part of uh the mow needs self-recognition people want to be recognized everywhere and anywhere see and and when we see these things we think it is good and sometimes even Believers are tempted to do the same thing right I was talking to a group of ministers and they were baptizing so many people and they were posting in baptize 10 Souls baptize 15 Souls baptize like this baptize like that and it's it seems good it seems encouraging but for me you're just blowing your horn you don't have to do it God will see it amen God will see it when I was working with with with Bible Believers in Canada uh in in in the Philippines they have this brother bcal uh had this office there and I was first three years of working with them I never got never got like a thank you card or thank you brother for what you're doing and I I was I was starting to get uh disappointed I said this is the most unrewarding Ministry because you're doing something for so many and nobody sees it and I was praying Lord what I do I have to what do and then brother Bisal sent me a letter there was no it was through his nail mail it was not email so he sent me a letter and there was a phrase there that encouraged me he said you he didn't know what I was feeling but you can sense that God was speaking through him to for me and he said brother Vernon maybe nobody has see seeing what you're doing for the Lord and in italicize he said but God sees it and it made a difference difference in my life no matter if people will not see what you're doing maybe uh you are just a young man a young woman and nobody sees what you're doing nobody's appreciating you it really doesn't matter because God sees you maybe you are now old you could before you are doing so many things for the Lord so many things for the community so many things for the church and now because you are in a retired mode you cannot move that fast anymore you canot think that fast anymore and dementia is slowly crawling in your mind you forget your name you forget everything but God saw what you did God saw what you did and that is all that matters it's not what people will say because all this people that will give compliments to you one day they will forget you right they will forget you right as I always say I was in Germany in 2008 I was there I went to a brother there was a house Bible study and a brother he said after the Bible study he says brother verer I was so blessed I was so blessed and you know as a young preacher he said oh this family was blessed because of my preaching two years later just two years 2010 I went back and I went back to the house of that brother brother ger sent me to that brother to conduct another Bible study and the brother said the same brother that gave compliments told me oh brother Veron I'm glad you've came here the first time so he didn't even remember me so sometimes people give compliments not sincerely so I told that brother and I said brother I think you were not sincere when you were complimenting me two years ago and he said sorry because uh I said there's so many foreign Brothers coming here and preaching so and I saidou are forgiven and so I came back um this year and he saw me from afar he remembered me so my point is people will compliment you they will say how blessed they are of what you did to them but don't be carried away by by those compliments be carried away that God with the thought that God sees our every move our reward is not here on Earth our reward is in heaven amen see as a pastor for the last 18 years I I sometimes you you care for the people you you preach to them you are so concerned to them and sometimes this happens in every Church in every church every every word the word there will come a rebellious Spirit speak things against you and it hurts the pastor it hurts you because you have given so much for them and because you said something in the Pulpit that hurt their feeling they'll go against you see and if you are not in tune with what God is telling you then you will get disappointed you will get depressed you will build a complex against these people even the prophet he built a complex to the people that he he was preaching to how much more myself I'm not a prophet so it's easy to build a complex to the people that you are serving and now they are going against you but again it's not about the people that you're serving you're doing it for God you are not listening to me you're listening to God I am I am preaching for you not not to please you but to please God and when I do that and that is if if that is in my thoughts people may go against you but you know in your heart that you have pleased God so we need this humbling experience we have to thank the Lord for this humbling experience that's why the prophet uh in the message God hiding himself in simplicity he said keep humbling yourself because if we will not humble ourselves God will have to Humble us and that's not an easy thing to experience but if we every day we walk uh every day we wake up every day we live a life and after the end at the end of the day we ask the Lord Lord thank you for the humbling experience thank you for all these things and if you need more ask for more see why because it builds our character and I think all of us here after many years of serving the lord we can see that we are not what we used to be God has taught us we may not be as humble as we are right now that before we were a little bit arrogant but now because of the things that you have done that is the reason why older people are so mellow they speak a little slow because they they they they want to be sure of what they're saying they're full of wisdom not because they're physically weak but because they have learned a lot they have learned a lot see and if we can be that way then we can show the other other people that we are we have learned from our uh younger years because if if you see an older man an older woman that's still so aggressive or maybe so still arrogant maybe he hasn't have that much of a humbling experience and we should pray for them that God will give them humbling experience see we should pray for them see and sometimes everything that you have accomplished it will be taken away from you everything that you have acquired can you imagine in the last pandemic there are people that I know I mean friends that are not believers they have saved and saved their money they've ensured everything all the possession and they're looking down to the people that have not saved in their life life in their lifetime see and then this pandemic came everything that they had was taken away from them even their health see just one one one sickness coid it was not even cancer but it can be easily taken away from us and we think that we have everything but we do we the prophet we have nothing we have nothing everything we are just stewards we are just the wordss you see sometimes uh I always do this for um for the young Professionals in in the Philippines if there's like uh I would say like a a a seminar we we call it a seminar so we can attract the young professionals to come because if it's a church service they might not want to come so but it's about Christian Life in the second secular world see and we always uh or I would say I always uh tell tell this this these people the the young people that in our life there's always these stages right um you God will give you uh you will start in in a company that you're working for your an employee then you get promoted you become a supervisor and then you got promoted you become a manager or a leader of a certain group then you realize from management right you become you you you acquire position then there's ownership sometimes you start owning your company owning your house owning these things but as you get older you realize it's not about ownership it's about stewardship that everything we have relationship money material things it's just we don't own that we don't even own our own family we are stewards of these things at the end of the road we will be accountable of how we manage our family our finances even the ministry that the Lord has given us I always look at myself and I say this is the ministry that the Lord has given me from the time I started doing Ministry at age 33 at this point in time in my life and if the Lord will T and will entrust more Ministry to me I said one day I will stop one day I this I I don't own my Ministry it was just a privilege that the Lord has given me and at the end of all these things I'll be accountable how did I use my time how did I use my position how did I use the influence that the Lord has given me how did uh uh I use the Ability that he has given me if I have used it for my own good or for for for to to to make myself known that then I have failed but if you have used all these things to glorify God in our life to live a life that's worthy of the Gospel to please God and to be to be a blessing to others then and only then we can say that we are good stewards of the mysteries of God because at the end of the day we will leave everything everything yes see in the last I I'll be closing on this thought last January I had three God has blessed with with three mentors in my life in the ministry aside from uh my former Pastor in the Philippines brother Nestor God has used three Elder ministers in my life when I say used because I have direct contact with them I work with them in the mission field and I have received uh I mean their Ministry has a great influence in my life one of them is brother Ed bcal from Cloverdale who is now 89 years old another is brother ger rodal is now 83 years old in Germany so from Canada from Germany and another brother from Georgia uh a church that I came from last week brother Samu Dale uh who who is now 83 and is also uh all of them are sick except brother ger who can still preach and I as I see last January I prayed Lord I want to visit them these are in different countries I want to visit them because I don't want to go to their funeral they're already dead I want to talk to them personally and thank them personally for their impact in my life and I want to like to hear the the the last words of wisdom that they can pass on through me and I was praying and praying and then um it came to past I'm now in the US I just came from Georgia I was in Germany last uh uh August and I was in uh Clover day last June it was not a long trip I just spent time with them talk to them and I was um happy that they still remember my name because there's slowly sleeping away from you know their their minds and when I saw brother bcal and I realized it was a uh something that catched my attention in all these three brothers they have done so many things in the mission field for the kingdom of God for the glory of God of course I'm not saying that they are perfect they have their own faults and that that is what make us perfect when you have faults right without faults we are not perfect so I thank the Lord for their imperfection and but I learned from them but at the end of the ministry it's not it's not a bad thing it's not a negative thing but at the end of the ministry I realized that we are just all stewards of God what God has given us am now brother bisc is not preaching anymore he's in a home care being taken care of brother Samuel Dale from Georgia uh is's he's having dementia and I I I just felt sad to see them that way but I I I I thank the Lord because I've gained something from them and brother guard is get slowly getting weaker but it came to my mind that these are just temporary things that the Lord allows us to do it's not permanent somebody some someday somebody will replace us somebody that may even be better than us or may be lesser than us but it really doesn't matter because it is not a permanent thing I believe that they have been good stewards of the ministry that the Lord has entrusted to them I'm thankful that I learned from them but it it teach it it taught me something that what I what I have today one day it will be taken away the strength the intelligence and everything you'll just go back to Childhood see you'll just be carried around right but as long as we live as long as we are strong and God can use us let us be used by God but never ever go to a point that you think that you are being used by God because of your ability because it's not you may whatever Ministry that the Lord has given it's just privilege and for me I've been saying that many years ago but now it's becoming a reality because I'm getting older what used to be a theory now is becoming a reality and I said one day one day I'll be stopping my Ministry I don't know when I don't know how but I asked Lord if my time is over and I cannot preach anymore bar I just want to go home I don't want to be sitting in a wheelchair it's nothing bad about it but I'm a very active person I cannot I don't want to be to be bedridden I I said Lord if I will be a good Steward maybe if my time is over he just take me quietly we have an adage in in the military when a general is retiring he would say old soldiers never die they just fade away we are soldiers of the Lord Jesus Christ one day we will fade away nobody will even uh uh look for you nobody will say who he he is the for he was our former Pastor no once somebody takes your place even in a company in a family you will just be a memory and sometimes people forgets easily so it will not even be a memory right so again it's not about the person it's about the work of the Lord God's work is always in continuity if the Lord will t for the next 100 years there will be new set of people they will forget you they will forget me they even though we put everything on the website it will be lost that's right they will for forget everything but as long as the Lord God saw that you have became a good Steward that will last until eternity we have all eternity to talk about the opportunities that the Lord has given us and it it it it it encourages me my brothers my sisters to do more for the Lord not because of the people not because of the the compliments that I may receive but because God sees us God will see you and God will see you in the next life and we'll just be thankful Lord thank you for all the things that you have given me the Blessed opportunity to serve you so this is a blessed opportunity for me I may see you again in the future I may not see you again in the future but I'm sure I will see you in the Rapture amen so God bless you all and I pray that uh uh all will be well in our uh the remaining years of our spiritual journey and do pray for us in the Philippines you have I'm the third Filipino uh Minister that was here this year brother Nester brother Danny and I'm glad I'm the third because three

had in BCF so I love you all in the love of the Lord May uh I I know that you love us and maybe this afternoon I will share to you a little bit as before we take communion of what you have done some some of you may not know it but what you have done for the Believers not only in the Philippines but all Asia which will encourage us more so let's bow our heads and let's pray before I return it to Pastor Chad Heavenly Father we thank you for the things that you have done in our life there are experiences in our life that seems to be negative that seems to be uh bad things that happen in your life but there's no negative thing there's no bad thing that is happening in our life everything was allowed for a reason for a purpose and it is for our character development it is for our own good you made us humble in your in in in in in in front of you Lord you allowed us uh to to do things for your glory and Lord sometimes you give us failure and disappointments so that we may realize that it's not it's not our intellect it's not our ability it is because you loved us that you called us and used us to be a blessing to others may you continue to use this whole congregation from the pastor down to the youngest member Lord to be a blessing to many people and uh Lord I pray that you will grant the desire of each and everyone and we will live a life that is worthy of the Gospel

up every day I live Lord I love you amen that was just good life instruction amen I learned a whole lot and it makes that sermon brother Brandon preached humble thyself amen oh Lord help us to Humble ourselves cuz if if we don't he'll help us and like the brother was saying that's not so easy but in the end we'll always be thankful there was one word that he was preaching there at the end that really meant something to me and that really hit me with impact was the word stewardship that's a great takeaway for me something to always think about we're stewards amen we're not the creators he's the Creator we're not the one who gives gifts he gave gifts we're stewards over what he's given amen and one thing brother uh brother Vernon was sharing with us is about the word ministry remember when we were talking about gifts the word ministry is not necessarily pull pit Ministry the word ministry is to serve in whatever capacity God's given you to serve the rest of the body that's your ministry and I want to be a steward a faithful Steward I want to I I don't want to I don't want to waste all the opportunities I have and I'm ashamed that so many times that I've wasted and squandered and I'm ashamed of the failures in the past but I'm determined after hearing hearing this today to be a good Steward amen I want to be a good and faithful Steward I also saw brother Arley stutzman over here God bless you brother Arley it's good to have you in service with us amen we're going to dismiss with the song but I just wanted to remind you all of communion and feet washing back here at
