========================================

[Music] [Music] and help us [Music] [Music] praise the lord it's very very good to see you guys the few that are gathered here it's such a privilege to be able to be back in church and i know that most of the congregation is streaming which is very unusual for us it's an odd feeling but i know that many assemblies have had to do this they've been forced into a shutdown of one way or another and so now it's our turn to experience it for now and we pray god's mercy and grace be upon us and that god will just speak the way he always has amen you know that um i was just i was thinking the other day that the apostle paul made a strange statement i haven't looked it up it just comes to my mind fresh but he has that statement where he's telling them in the in the corinthian church how to deal with an issue they've got an issue that they need to deal with and he tells them when you're gathered together and my spirit is present you have to ask yourself paul was where else in the world but he said when my when you're gathered together to deal with this issue and my spirit is present with you this is what you should do showing that spirits don't they're not restricted by space matter and time amen so we have some that are streaming they may be on the at home in many different places in many different locations but if we're gathered together amen let's make our spirits here too amen let's just let's just put our licks of fire together and ask the lord to do what only he can do these are unusual times and unusual circumstances and we find ourselves in a place we don't want to be i can assure you more than anybody else this is a place we don't want to be i don't want to be in this condition in this time having to endure what we're enduring but god knew from before the foundation of the world and this is his will and so he takes it out of our hands and he does what he wants to do for his own glory and he does it in a way that no man will get glory nobody can say they had it figured out because nobody had this figured out but god already had it figured out from before the foundation of the world so we're learning to trust this whole life we've been learning to trust and this is still more learning to trust and while we're standing let's just take our bibles and look at psalms 103. psalms 103 and verse 1. so we've missed two services last wednesday and sunday so i'm out of practice in preaching so you'll have to help me brother bam said preaching something you got to stay up with and so praise god psalms 103 verse 1 bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord all my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like an eagles amen we all need this right now there's many in the assembly not feeling well they need this right now but it's god's promise for his children let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for all that you've done for us and lord we're so appreciative of you in this hour that we live that you've promised to be a friend that sticketh closer than a brother you promised you'd never leave us nor forsake us and lord if we can't gather together if we can't see one another for a week or two on end or however long you see fit to allow it god you still are a friend that sticketh closer than a brother lord you are the tower that we run into you are the very present help in a time of trouble you are the one that is always near and watching over and and you're you're trying to get us to rely on that lord and it's a lesson we don't want to learn this way it's a lesson that we don't want to have to endure through hard trials but it's something that you want to get us to to we learn to have total confidence and reliance upon you and not anybody else lord we submit to your ways we submit to your will we ask god that you would give us grace to walk in a way that's pleasing to you and lord that you would give us the wisdom to to understand what you want done every step of the way for all these times these are paths that we've never walked before these are not things that we can ask lord our grandparents or our parents what they did when they came to a time like this they've never come to a time like this but god you saw fit to place us here and your holy ghost leadership has not diminished one drop we're trusting in you and not in ourselves to lead us all the way and the paths of righteousness for your name's sake that you might be glorified lord bless your children that are not able to gather be with them wherever they are lord bless those that are still sick and body lord those that are struggling i pray that you would strengthen them i pray that you would just give them vigor and life lord and that the promise would begin to take effect in their body that you would bring their physical body subject to the promise in your word and make it line up in obedience to your promise that by your stripes we are already healed though we trust in you in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all have your seats amen if you can turn to proverbs turn with me to proverbs chapter 3. proverbs chapter 3 and verse 5. it says trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not into thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths what a good scripture trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not into thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths so that's instruction but it's instruction with a promise that he will direct thy path we just have to acknowledge him in all of our ways we need to uh trust in him with all our heart and lean not and that's the key lean not to our own understanding where we fall into trouble is leaning upon our own understanding and and you know i i feel like when we've come to this this trial that we're in the whole world's in a trial you know but us as an assembly we're in a trial certain individuals and families within the assembly are in in hard trials and we never wanted to be here and in fact you know i didn't believe we would have to see this i didn't believe any sickness in this virus would touch our assembly and i knew i didn't have thus saith the lord and i knew i didn't have the word of the lord or our promise but i believed that we honor god's words we stand for him and i believe the bride would have been spared this as it swept through but god had a different understanding than my understanding and he's not obligated to do things according to our understanding but he already has a plan before the foundation of the world and although i wanted it to go a different way and i thought that it would and and i and i you know i was confident that god was going to spare us and this would sweep over and god would protect his children and his bride you know just because god didn't meet my expectations doesn't change anything like nothing has changed there's absolutely nothing changed the word hasn't changed the the seed of god hasn't changed the plan of god hasn't changed the purpose and all this just because it didn't meet my or your whoever else's expectation changes nothing the program of god is not off by one click and so we have to remind ourselves you know because when i first uh wednesday when i first got the report that somebody in the assembly had been uh tested positive for coven 19 it it took my breath away i mean it just shocked me and it come from out of left field you know in a place i didn't expect and it was wednesday as i was preparing for service and i didn't know what that would mean i didn't know what we'd have to do differently for service and so i canceled the service so we had time to figure out what to do and and as we tried to figure out what to do and learn more and we began to make some phone calls and we found out that the the government was really good with us and the health department was really nice nobody ever said anything we didn't have to you know jump through any hoops we didn't have any anything that we had to change or do differently they were very very kind and very easy and good to work with so so but as we went through that process we begin to learn more about the the director's order and and more about the extension you know there was an extension that went until may 1st and as we learned more than we had a brother who understands law who helped us break it down and understand and as we begin to understand more we begin to realize what what our exemption entailed we are allowed to have religious services but under certain exemptions and we need to fulfill certain requirements and so all of that came together friday and saturday and really on saturday so i felt like there was no way to get all the implementation in place before sunday so we cancel sunday service so here we are cancelled wednesday service cancel sunday service and all i want to do is see the saints like the only thing i want to do is see the people i just want to see their faces and i just want to talk to them and i want everybody to know that that everything's okay and we're going to be fine but because once we learn what the requirements and obligations are for what they consider an essential business which is churches are included as a religious entity under the exemption but we have things that we need to do in order to fulfill the obligation and that exemption so we can still gather so in order to do that we just needed more time so that's why we're here with just the officers in the church and their families because everybody understands what those requirements are because we met last night and talked about it and so we're going to move forward as the lord leads we don't know what we don't know exactly what sunday's going to be like the next wednesday to sunday after that we're just asking god to give us leadership so that we can do what we're supposed to do according to the to the law to fulfill what caesar requires but still be able to gather together in some fashion or another and have life preaching so that the streaming can go out to those who aren't able to make it in so just pray for god's leadership so that we know how to make every step so that we know what to do and we can do it according to god's perfect plan and god's perfect will and he said we don't we would have picked a different path we would have we would have chosen different outcomes we would have we would have had you know if it was us we would have had something super fantastic take place and we would have all been gathered together and and the walls would have shook and and the the rafters would have lifted and the power of god would have swept through and there would have been prophecy go forth and nobody would have been touched by anything and anything would have been lifted off amen that's in our minds that's the way we always want it to be but god is always wanting to do something in a different way than what we ever anticipated and god is full of surprises and part of spiritual maturity is learning to just move with the way god wants to move and when god decides to move differently and you know for for this evening i just want to preach on expectations expectations because we had expectations i i don't want to say we i don't want to include anybody else but i had expectations and god did not meet my expectations amen but i don't ever when we come to a place as children of god we're being trained we're being trained to come to the final showdown friends this is part of that training what we're going through now is part of learning to fully rely on god lean not to our own understanding trust in him acknowledge him in all our ways and let him direct our path not to have everything figured out but to let him who's got it figured out lead step by step and it doesn't ever stop us from having expectations i don't know that it ever can stop us from having expectations it'll never stop us from pondering it'll never stop us from probing and poking and starting to try to put puzzle pieces together before the time i don't know that god ever wants us to stop doing that because that's part of loving his word that's part of anticipating what he's going to do that's looking forward with joyful expectation to what god will do next i don't know that he ever wants us to stop that but we have to learn that that's just us and that's not god and god can do it different and it's going to be okay and when god comes in and shakes your puzzle back apart and says you have it all wrong amen we got to say well thank you god and not just get so disappointed and discouraged you know when i found out that what happened to us i what i thought wouldn't happen happened i was at first disappointed there was disappointment my first emotion was disappointment and then i had concern for the individuals who weren't well and you know i would begin to mourn for them i had concern and began to pray but but then my disappointment faded and i realized nothing changed god is still god i was personally disappointed because god didn't do what i thought he should do but i can't be disappointed in god because god didn't change and i can't be disappointed in the word of god because the word of god didn't change you know and so we we've got to come back to that place where the word of god is unmovable and if we had the wrong idea about the word of god doesn't change the word of god all it does is prove that we we you know it proves the fact that i'm i'm very consistent in being wrong about the future very consistent if there's anything i'm consistent and i'm very consistent about being wrong in the future and god gives us just enough to know that there's these pieces in the future that are coming and there's these things that'll happen and you just have enough pieces to know that something's out there but he doesn't paint the whole picture until you get there and you're right in the middle of it and in the middle of it you still sometimes don't clearly understand but as soon as you step forward to step or two you're like that's it that's it that's it because god wants us to walk by faith not by sight and if we could figure it out ahead of time we would walk by sight because we already have it figured out and all we have to do but god wants us to walk by faith and not by sight so he will he'll even let us like children play with his word like his children will take this is this is my father's word and look it seems to match and fit here and god's smiling because he knows he's going to train his child to know you're not me and you that you don't know and he's going to mess it up so that we can learn to fully rely on him so it was it was disappointing but but in that disappointment we had to make a quick decision on wednesday and we decided to stream brother abraham's service and i had recommended people watch it and i had watched it with my family as a devotion and and it just come to mind let's just do that and i watched it and i sat in my living room and watched it again knowing all the circumstances that we're now in that we weren't in in november when he preached it and then when he preached that sermon i was just astounded at how prophetic and how perfect it was and how it fit the situation and i was greatly comforted by that but then sunday again we had to make a quick decision because we canceled church saturday i believe saturday afternoon and i had to make a very fast decision so first message popped in my mind on the wings of a snow white dove i didn't even have to ponder didn't even have to think about it as soon as i decided to cancel the next thought on the wings of the snow white dove and we played that and we gathered our family and many most of you i'm assuming gathered to to watch that as well and i was shocked again at how perfect how perfect and it was not by forethought no thought no thought injected in that at all first message popped in my mind and i said it brother franco came over and he got it going for us so we could do it with the words so we appreciate him being instant in season and out of season but but it was perfect so through it all god's perfect even when we weren't able to be together god was perfect and i was marveled in brother abraham when he began to preach on the weakening of the ministry because i can tell you i felt weak friends i couldn't even come to church and preach i mean that's the weakening of the ministry you can't even get behind the pulpit and preach to the to the people that god has called to gather together an assembly in one service and then the next service and then you know things changing is the weakening of the ministry because the weakening of the ministry is the rising of the bride is the maturity of the bride because the bride is not going to be held in second place but the bride is coming to full manifestation that doesn't mean there won't be a ministry there'll be a ministry but it can't be the strong ministry that solves every problem and figures everything out and it's right and correct every time and so we got a good dose of that and i i appreciate it brother brother abraham brought that out that we can't just rely on one or two or three people or strong ministers they'll figure it all out then they'll tell me and then i'll do what what god brought over the pulpit and all be figured out god could at any time remove that so that we as an individual have to say god's in control he can tell me what to do next that we all have to be able to hear from god and so it was breaking my heart not to be with the people and it's breaking my heart now you have no idea how hard it is for me not to have everybody here i want more than anything to have everybody here to see everybody to see how they're doing to have the dynamics of preaching to make that connection on the spirit realm during the service so i can feel how everybody's doing and it's breaking my heart but this is what god wants for right now this is his path this is his choice and i know it is god definitely laid on my heart not to fight it just to go with it and so i don't have anything else figured out past that just don't fight it but god wants every one of us to know in our homes and in our workplaces and in our prayer closets he can lead us as an individual he can tell us personally what to do or he can tell us nothing and make us wait it out but that we learn to rely on him not somebody else we've all had to go through this we've had some lessons you know when whenever something happens in an unexpected way you begin to ask yourself questions why why is this happening why why didn't it go the way i expected it you know and we we know that god's made promises there's a there's promises out there there's quotes out there that there's plagues coming and they won't touch any of those that have the holy ghost and that's true and i believe that but we don't know what point and what plagues they're coming there's things coming up on the earth and even in the in the exodus and the exodus when the plagues were falling the first three affected those in goshen just like they affected everybody else but when it came to the fourth plague god said i'm going to create a distinction now that that goshen's going to be separated out to create a distinction between my people and those that aren't and then the plague didn't affect them until they get to the last plague then it affected everybody so so some affect everybody some the the the children of god will be free from in the exodus journey god decides where he makes that cut god decides where he makes that cut but i'm not ashamed that i believed that he would bypass us i'm not embarrassed that i believed that he wouldn't let this sickness fall on us because that's how children should believe that my dad won't let this hurt me is that how we want our children to believe my dad will take care of me my dad's not gonna let anything bad happen to me my father's gonna take care of me knowing in your mind that anything can happen and then when we got in our car and we drove here we believed that god wouldn't let us get an accident coming to church right we never get in our car and believe today's the day god's going to let me get an act we always believe god's going to protect us god's going to provide for us and we're going to get here and i'm not embarrassed to believe that and then if god allows us to be in an accident or allows us to get hurt or allows the tragedy to come then i'm not embarrassed that i believed he wouldn't let it happen because i believe that my father takes care of me and if he's allowed a tragedy to come a sickness or an injury or an accident or something to come then that's what he wants to happen and now my faith will switch to him protect caring for me healing me delivering me from this situation and i'm not embarrassed to be a child with child like faith so you know i'm embarrassed sometimes that my intellect is a failure but i'm not embarrassed to have childlike faith i'm not ashamed to believe i'm not ashamed to have believed that god would not let this plague that's sweeping the earth touch touches bride but i'm also not ashamed that he let it touch his bride because now i believe it's time to switch to the promises and said there's promises for this too that by his stripes we are already healed that he'll take care of us and that nothing happens in the life of a believer unless it first crosses god's desk and he signs off on it everything is clicking just right on time nothing is out of cater with god so we either have to accept that or we don't accept it you can't have it in between because if we mix that somewhere in between then we're always on pins and needles and we're always nervous and we're always uncertain of where we stand so when god lets things like this happen it means sometimes it's just so we can learn not to rely on our own understanding and maybe that we can be more cautious with what we think and to bring a greater humility which we'll take we'll always take it a greater humility god it's not a bad thing if you if you show me that my intellect is poor and my ability to see the future is flawed thank you god that's a good reminder if you're going to humble us back to full dependence on you and not to take and inject our own thinking so much and get so comfortable with assuming that we can think things and put pieces together but god will sometimes strip that right out so we don't get comfortable in that arena i'm okay with that so every once in a while god will do something like that so we realize hey this is just what i think and it could be wrong and more likely than not it is but i still like thinking about these things so so we're learning to trust in the lord regardless whether it happens the way we thought or we didn't think we're learning to trust in the lord i want to drop something in a brother shared with me from the assembly here concerning brother branham in a worldwide pandemic just because i thought it was very interesting and encouraging but this brother shared with me that in 1957 and 58 there was a worldwide pandemic and then he and he pulled this off the cdc website and went and looked at it of the center for disease control website and there was a a new virus a new influenza virus emerged in east asia triggering a pandemic called asian flu and that was in 1957 and into 1958 then according to the cdc it says the estimated number of deaths was 1.1 million worldwide 1957 1958 1.1 million worldwide where this pandemic is at 80 some thousand worldwide so this was 1.1 million it was huge so far to date it was much bigger than the one that's going on now we don't know how this would win we don't know how much bigger it'll get but to date 1.1 million worldwide that's how many people died not infected died and 116 000 died in the united states so this was a big deal this was a big pandemic that was sweeping the world but listen what brother branham says in sirs we would see jesus from december of 1957 and now to be here with my good friend brother hutchins and brother joseph jose and this was supposed to be my vacation this fall i started a vacation and i like to hunt real well so i went out west to go hunting the party that i went with including myself all broke down with this here asian flu we didn't even take our guns from the cases and came back home so brother branham caught the asian flu him and the whole hunting party was with so being with brother branham would not have spared you from the asian flu him being a prophet of god for the age didn't spare him from the asian flu that was a worldwide pandemic so if we've not been spared from the asian flu or from from the coronavirus then we're just in the same category as the prophet of god he says a few days later four days later and speak to this mountain and i come up here on my vacation i started on my vacation early fall and the whole group broke down with the asian flu we had to come back so don't feel discouraged if you caught a sickness as a worldwide pandemic brother branham did too and everybody that was with him in his hunting party did too so even if brother brenham was here preaching in this church we could still catch a disease from a pandemic so god's god if he would allow one child to go through that he'll allow another child to go through that amen and it doesn't spare us only until it comes to the time where god says now i'm going to make a distinction between what's mine and what's not and from that point on and god's the only don't god's the only one who knows when he's going to make that distinction he's the only one who knows when and where he'll draw the line amen and then he'll just do it and he won't consult us ahead of time he'll just do it and we'll see it happen so praise be to god so when we look at expectation we can look all the way through the scriptures and we find that god god i don't think has ever done anything according to his people's expectations i don't think i don't think i can see anywhere in the scripture where they've never he's ever done anything according to now listen according to his people's expectations these aren't even unbelievers but his believing children had an expectation and he did it different to their expectation but i i i'd like to inject this and say it like this just because god doesn't doesn't do things according to my expectations i never want to be in a place where i quit expecting him to do the miraculous [Applause] i want to be an expectation every moment of every day for the hand of god to move understanding that god doesn't have to do it according to my expectation but i will never lose expectation for him to do the miraculous any way he chooses and any time and any time he decides in any manner possible i'm still expecting him to move i'm expecting him to heal i'm expecting him to deliver i'm expecting him to protect i'm expecting him to show his hand mighty i'm expecting him all the time knowing that he may not meet my expectations but i'm expecting him to move amen let's go to second kings and we'll just look at a couple places here like a bible study if we could second kings chapter five second kings chapter five and i'm going to start reading at verse nine so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of elijah and we all know this is naaman the syrian he's a general uh in the army in syria and he had leprosy and then he had a little maid that he had stolen in a campaign that was a servant a little maid out of israel and when she knew that the master had leprosy she told uh she told her mistress she said oh that he could go and see the prophet elisha in israel for he would heal him so this word got out and he came and now he's coming to elisha and it says so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of elisha and elisha sent a messenger to him saying go and wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shall be clean but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the lord his god and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper are not at abner and farper rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in rage so here naaman come down with his horses and with his chariots so naaman's an important person he's a mighty man where he comes with wealth he comes with gifts he comes with a with a train with with servants with whatever so it's an impressive showing he's coming in an oppressive way to this great prophet who's going to heal him and he's so used to pomp and he's so used to uh performances and he's so used to being in the royal palace and in the courts he's got a certain expectation and like us he's always expecting god to do super duper big things amen but the prophet of god says great things are silent amen god evaporates millions of gallons or billions or trillions of gallons of water off the earth every day and never makes a noise he said the earth turns and you never hear it creak you know nothing ever happens and so it's not it's not always the way we think it's going to come we have in our mind our expectation and naaman had an expectation and the prophet of god sent a messenger out to him to tell him exactly what to do to be healed he was getting an exact answer to his request and he was going to get a perfect healing a perfect healing according to his desire but because it didn't come the way he expected it he was angry instead of happy oh what a lesson friends how many times our disappointment turns into frustration because something didn't happen the way we wanted it but god was doing exactly what we asked him to do but he was doing it in such a humble unique different way than what we expected we didn't recognize that this was healing this man he thought what does it matter jordan what does it matter muddy george what do you mean dip in jordan yeah this has nothing to do with anything you know we have a we have a question on our mind or a desire from god and god comes in and waylays our plan brings something else on the scene what in the world now i got to deal with this problem why is this happening when i'm in already in this situation and not recognizing that the new problem is bringing the solution to the first problem but we become roth and disappointed and angry because we have another trouble or another trial or i thought god would just come down and boom it would all be over but he was angry verse 12 or verse 13 and a servant came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing would thou not have done it how much rather than when he saith to thee wash and be clean then when he down and dipped himself seven times and the man dipped himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean when he dropped his expectation and just took what was in front of him he got a perfect healing and in this situation if we can just drop our expectation now god smashed our expectation it's done it's over with forget the expectation but now god's doing something now there's something before us we can fight against it or we can say god's doing something i don't understand what he's doing but every step of the way as he leads me i want to walk with humility and reverence and i want to walk joyfully amen because he's doing something i don't understand it it didn't come to my expectation but i don't want to be disappointed i don't want to grumble and complain i don't want to begin to throw away all the confidence that i've had that got me to this point you know god has been so perfect all the way through he has led us so perfectly to get us to the spot that we're in now amen and we were joyful rejoicing two weeks ago because we saw service after service perfection and god coming in and preaching the word in such a way it was hitting the perfect spot and we were so happy but god was actually preparing us for this not to be happy during that service the service wasn't coming to bring joy during the preaching the service was coming to give instruction for today and we were happy then but let's not throw away the confidence of what god has done just because of the the missed expectation that we have now so now now's the time to say you know what god didn't do what i thought he would do but he's doing what he always thought he would do and there was a time that i was in his thoughts and in his thoughts we had fellowship and i knew what he would do and i was happy with the plan then i was confident it was correct i saw the plan of redemption and i shouted for joy with the sons of god amen i clapped and sang praises because i agreed with his plan then when i was an attribute in his thinking and i want to say down in my soul i agree with his plan now i don't understand his plan in my human mind my human flesh doesn't want to walk this way i don't want one person in the assembly to suffer i don't want people to be offended because of our actions i don't want the community and the medical staff to feel like we didn't care i don't want any of those consequences but i agreed with his plan then and i agree with his plan now don't understand it many people misunderstand why we've done what we've done but god doesn't misunderstand there's a leadership of the holy ghost that's more important than the leadership of mind common sense science or reasoning we haven't walked so far in faith now that we're going to allow reasoning and science to dictate our only actions from here on out i won't do that regardless of how difficult things are regardless of how how wrong my thinking was and how inaccurate my idea was i'm not going to go just because god didn't meet my expectations and what i thought and first saw what happened didn't happen the way i thought and foresaw it i'm not going to run to the side of reasoning and science amen to make all our decisions from here on out because reasoning and science is going to go one way and that's in the satan civilization no matter what happens we've got to continue to walk by faith in the leadership of the holy ghost even if it makes no sense and even if nobody else around us agrees with what we're doing it's not we can't make everybody happy i just want to make one happy and that's my father that's in heaven the situation is is difficult things are not fun they're heartbreaking we're grieving we're praying night after night all night i've been in prayer i haven't slept through the night for over a week i haven't slept more than just a few hours at a time one night and over a week i've got seven hours sleep because i'm interceding on behalf of brethren all night long this is not where we want to be but it's where he wants us to be and we're willing to go his path even if it's different than our path you know abraham had an expectation when god spoke to him and said you're going to have a son his expectation was immediately he was going to have a son but after waiting so many years and not having the son that he expected to have his wife began to have a doubt about how it would come so she she had an expectation and her expectation was that god wants us to do something ourselves that god gave us his prophecy and and god expects us we can't just sit around forever we got a little something we need to do that's been the failure of the church that was the failure of eve that's been the failure of the of the of the church ages is that we got to do a little something ourselves and so she thought well well i think what would be best brother branham explains this in detail is to take hagar my maid because it's legal then it's it's okay according to the law amen and take her and then she'll bear a son unto me and that's how we'll fulfill the promise and because of the waiting and because of the missed expectation and not having a son right away amen abraham gave in to his wife and they fulfilled their plan and it was the wrong idea it was reasoning it was reasoning and it failed to produce the promised son but god's plan never stopped one drop just because they did wrong just because they had the wrong idea and move forward in the wrong idea god's god's plan didn't miss one click in the cog at the right appointed time the right appointed woman in the right season conceived seed from the right man and brought forth the promised son according to what god's plan always was and then when god asked him to to slay that son take him up and slay him in the hill where i told you abraham now has learned he has learned that what god says do what god says he learned it through the circumstances with his with his father through the circumstances with lot he's learned to do what god says and so god says slay your son he's going to slay his son but he also had so much confidence in the word of god and the promise of god that if god promised by isaac shall my seed be called that god's going to do something to preserve the life of isaac so now abraham is stuck between two words of god one that says by thy son isaac shall thy seed be called and slay thy son thine only son and abraham finds himself smack dab between two spoken words of god what do you do when you get in that spot pick which one you're gonna no he couldn't pick either they both have to be true how are they true i don't know how they're true but he's so confident that both are true that he's confident he will kill his son but he's confident that out of isaac shall the seed be called so much so that the two lads that are coming with them and bearing the stuff he tells the servants he said the lad and i will go and worship yonder and return the lad and i will go and return but if you pick up the story in hebrews i'll read it to you here hebrews 11 17 says by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure so abraham had an expectation when he went up to mount moriah to slay he knew he was going to keep the word of god and he knew he's going to kill isaac but he knew and isaac shall his seed be called seed be called so he assumed in his mind that god would raise him from the dead and that was never god's plan it was never god's plan to raise him from the dead it was always god's plan to show himself jehovah jireh and provide a lamb as a substitute for the sacrifice but abraham didn't know that part of the plan he wasn't told that part of the plan all he knew was to move forward with what i know i know and isaac is my seed called i know that he told me to slay him so reasonably thinking he's going to raise him from the dead but god wasn't depending on abraham's reason and abraham's wrong reasoning never stopped the plan of god amen as long as he just stayed obedient to what god said he could have the wrong idea about how god's going to perform it but god will still perform it as long as abraham stays obedient to the part he knows to stay obedient to so you see what i'm saying friends all we got to do is walk in full obedience to the revealed word of god and there's portions that we don't understand there's portions that we cannot figure out and even if we think wrong about it it doesn't matter god's still going to do what god's going to do if we just stay obedient to what he told us to do everything he says do if we'll do he'll worry about the rest even if he does it different than the way we thought and even if the way we thought is totally wrong it doesn't matter we just have to walk in obedience don't throw away that confidence abraham got to a place where god had given him the promised son through sarah his wife amen he worked the miraculous he did it he can't throw that confidence away now he's got to say hey god's going to do what he whatever he's going to do he's going to do but it doesn't change the promise it doesn't change the word that he told me amen when what god has told us the promises that he's made to us is not going to change the circumstances don't change the promise things get worse it doesn't change the brother brandon said if i prayed and if everybody i prayed for tonight died he said i'd come back the next day and have a healing line and pray for the sick why he said because the promise is true and the circumstances don't change the promise god's promised to bless us and prosper us but if we go through a time and trial of losing money in a time of trial of losing prosperity it doesn't change that promise he still promised to bless us and prosper us he will in his own good time but if he allows a trial to come to look like you're moving in the opposite of this word don't worry about it this word is still true if he promised to heal you and it looks like you get sicker don't be discouraged believe the promised word god will do what god promised he will do just trust in him whatever the outcome trust in him don't throw away the confidence that we have he's led us this far he can do things we never expected him to do he can do things we never wanted him to do but he still knows what he's doing he's smarter than we are he just wants obedience he just wants children that learn to walk according to his word and if he does something in an unexpected way we'll say well bless god anyways if he does something we don't want him to do we say we bless god anyways he does something that hurts we say we bless god anyways for god is god let's look at matthew chapter 3 together i just want to look at a couple more of these we haven't been together in a while so let's just stay together it feels good to be together in the word matthew chapter 3. verse 11. this is uh john the baptist now preaching he says i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge the floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire so john the baptist is the prophet of the age and the prophet of the age is now giving the prophecy for that age and he's talking about the coming messiahs coming about jesus christ that he's going to bow i'm baptizing with water under repentance but he's going to baptise you with the holy ghost and fire and his fan is in his hand and he'll thoroughly purge his dressing floor and he's going to burn up the chaff that's a prophecy he's laying out a prophecy but john's going to take his own idea about that prophecy and john is the prophet of the age the one to give the prophecy a seed gene of god but he's going to take his own idea about that prophecy let's go over to matthew chapter 11. [Music] matthew chapter 11 verse 2. now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another john was the one who was the forerunner to declare he coming he saw the spirit like a dove descending out of heaven and lighting up on christ he's saying this is him he baptized him amen he fulfilled that word he's the one who gave the prophecy amen but because jesus ministry didn't match his expectation of jesus ministry he began to question whether he was the one or not or do we look for another and he sent two of his disciples and brother bam said see his eagle eye got filmed over he wasn't backslidden he wasn't he wasn't the eagle of the age he was no long he wasn't that he wasn't a child of god amen he was he his eagle eye got filmed over because his own reasoning his own understanding amen had had hid from his view the fulfillment of the word because jesus did miracles that day and he says now you go tell john i'm fulfilling these scriptures the lame walk the blind see the gospel is preaching to the poor what's he doing he was fulfilling the word and telling him go say you saw the fulfillment of the word so that he'll know this is still the word being fulfilled just not the portion that he thought was for now praise be to god amen this is how god trains his children and if it can happen to john the baptist can it happen to you and i absolutely and so brother baby says in modern events are made clear by prophecy he said john's eagle eye had been filmed over and he was in the prison he was fixing to die said go ask him see john said oh his fan is in his hand he'll thoroughly purge his floor he thought the millennium would start right then he thought the grain was ready but it had to die and go to the stalk and come up again to make the true bride john thought it was ready john thought because he was there messiah was here everything's in place it's going to happen just like this and when the millennium didn't set in like he thought all of a sudden he began to wonder is this him or do we look for another right jesus never condemned john jesus performed a sign before the word and said go tell him the word go show him the fulfillment of the word because john's in the lexi he'll understand the fulfillment of the word he didn't pet him he didn't baby him he didn't condemn him he just showed him the word children of god are led by the word of god they respond to the word of god let's look at matthew 16 together matthew 16 and 21 from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou are an offense unto me for thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of man of men jesus was the word made flesh and he was speaking the word but because peter had something else in his mind peter's refusing the word coming from the word because peter wants something else to happen peter wants jesus to set up his earthly kingdom then because peter's part of it already peter's in the inside and peter's going to get a position and peter wants certain portions of the word to be fulfilled right now but god wasn't doing it right then there was another portion of the word that had to be fulfilled first let's go to luke 24. luke 24 and 19. this is the road to emmaus cleopas and his friend are walking along talking in verse 19 it says and he said unto them what things jesus had drawn up alongside he heard them talking and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people now the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and certain women also of our company made us astonish which were early at the sepulcher and when they found not his body they they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not he said jesus is walking alongside of him he's in another form now he says what things in the beginning describe you know concerning jesus of nazareth who was killed we had thought verse 21 we but we trusted that it had been he they were trusting that it was him but because of the circumstances they lost faith in what they believed and they were right it says and we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel he was the one to redeem israel they just saw the act of redemption they had the right word they were correct in what they believed but because they expected it to happen in a different way now they threw away the very word that they were believing and the fulfillment of the word because it didn't happen according to their expectations oh friends if that could happen to the disciples what about you and i we can't throw away everything god's done because things don't happen the way we want we've got to stand still and see the salvation of our god [Music] when the pillar of fire come to rescue the children of israel in exodus they had a prophet they had a pillar of fire they had signs and wonders they had plagues they had everything that happened and they went out with a mighty hand and who knows what their expectation was but you can put yourself in their spot in bondage for 400 years in hard bondage for the last several years crying out as a nation to be delivered all of a sudden a mighty deliverer comes all the turmoil surrounded it's going to be free then it gets harder and then plagues and you're subject to the plagues then a distinction and then a mighty spoiling i mean the emotions were all over the place but when they finally went out they went out of victorious army spoiled all the goods of israel went out free amen went out of people with robes and silk and linen and and gold and jewels and and all of these things they went out and they were told specifically i have given you a land that flows with milk and honey and i will send at the be in before you and drive the inhabitants out and the cities are already built the houses are built the vineyards are planted the crops are in the ground and all of it was true but god didn't tell him the whole story he only told them part of it and that part was true but he reserved a part back because god has to teach them to walk by faith they they they i imagine they could have walked out of there and said now everything's looking up now finally 400 years of bondage these last few months with all these plagues weeks months however long it took all of this finally we're going out and look what all we got now let's just march up there by the time we get there the bees the hornets would have driven out all the inhabitants and we can just take all of our new jewels and all of our new furniture that we got from our neighbors and we can just move it into our new houses that are already built and then i'll just pluck some grapes off of the of the vine that's already planted you see their expectation was wrong but the word was right the word was true the expectation was wrong they were going to get there but they were going to be trained first they were going to endure hardness first they were going to have things go backwards upside down in every which way first to prove them to teach them to train them and then when they crossed into the land they were going to fight for every inch weren't they walled cities yes were the vineyards planted yes was the corn growing yes did it flow with milk and honey yes were there already houses built yes but it wasn't a walk in and take it amen that's the expectation and when they didn't meet the expectation they began to grumble and cry and complain to moses you said it's better if we stayed in egypt this blah blah blah blah blah why it'd be not because god lied not because moses lied not because the pillar of fire led one wrong step not because god wasn't faithful in every way amen they grumbled and complained and they fussed and they moaned and they were afraid because it didn't happen according to their expectations and all of a sudden what was joy turned in the morning in half a second they come the pillar of fire leading a victorious group of people freed from bondage by a mighty hand having destroyed egypt and spoiled them that pillar of fire leads them right to a trap but it was still the pillar of fire that did it he's still the pillar of fire i don't care if it's a trap he's the pillar of fire there's nothing to be afraid of if you're following the pillar of fire they saw the egyptian army coming down and they were finished and reasonably speaking there was no hope reasonably speaking that's why we can't rely on reasoning their their eyes their senses their mind could not find a way of escape what they saw as the dust cloud was rolling of the 600 chariots coming down the thunder they began to hear rolling on the horse's hoes pounding towards them they looked around they could see the cliffs they could see the the red sea they could see the only path of escape their eyes were lying to them their ears were lying to them their thoughts were deceiving them because the pillar of fire had led them there and said that he would take him all the way they had to deny sight sound thought feel they had to deny it all and choose to believe god's word and moses was willing because god had told him amen you're going to see this army you see you'll see no more amen he told him that he was going to harden his heart and he was going to destroy pharaoh and he looked at them and he says stand still don't run don't fret don't fuss stand still and see the salvation of god now having done all to stand stand amen do you have the armor on stand do you have the helmet of salvation the breast plate of rice is your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel do you do you have the sword of the spirit i mean do you have have you been have you been prepared as an army have you been equipped by the word of god have you been clothed by the armor of god and given the sword now it's time to stand still and see the salvation of god it's not time to fret and run around it's not time to let discouragement rob us of our faith you can't help being discouraged but you've got to cast down discouragement and cast down reasoning and take every thought that exalted itself against the knowledge of christ and bring it into captivity and obedience to christ and say god has not forsaken us god has not forgot us god has not led us into a death trap god has led us to the place he wants us to be and whatever we have to go through in this place is what he has determined and i want nothing more than to be found faithful at this hour i want to stand and see the salvation of god it may not look like we expect it to look like but will be his salvation brother brahma says referring to this road to emmaus so they went along the road oak cleopas said his friend i tell you i'm discouraged this morning but how could that man ever die cleopas he died i seen him dying he said can we just put ourselves in the disciples spot they saw this man walk on water they saw him take the loaves and fishes and break them with their very eyes they saw moore grow back they saw the fragments gathered up they saw the multitude that was fed for us we read it in a few lines they lived it they saw the hungry people they knew that it was impossible to feed them and they saw the little humble man just say a quiet prayer and take and break and break and break and and feed and feed and feed they saw them sitting by groups of 50s and groups of hundreds all over as far as the eye could see they saw a storm rise up that was going to kill them but they saw a man come walking on the water and as soon as he stepped into the boat it calmed and they found himself on the other side they saw a man who they wanted to take and stone and cast him off of precipice but they saw him turn invisible in a moment and walked past through the cloud crowd where they never saw him they saw him speak to the lame and they walked they saw him a woman touch his garment and be healed they thought he was invincible and could never be destroyed if you walked with a man like that for years what would you think i'd stay real close to that man i can't fault people for believing that brother branham would raise from the dead if you had walked like some of them walked to the brother branham and seen and heard what they had seen you would have believed for anything at that moment and these men walked with jesus christ saw the miracles heard the preaching and then saw what had happened and here they can't believe that he died because they never expected him to die but his death was not outside the word not outside the plan of god but outside of their own thinking oh i hope we can learn the lessons no matter what we see we gotta we gotta remember who we are do you have a revelation of who you are and do you have a revelation of whom whom you belong to if we have a revelation of who we are and who we belong to then i say stand still and see the salvation of god because he's not forgotten he knows exactly who we are and where we are and we know that he's our father we know we're his child and that revelation should bring a peace deep down inside maybe not to your mind but deep down inside there's something that says he's not left me he's not forsaken me he's not forgotten me but all is well all is well it may not be the way i want it but all is well he said he died back to this quote again i seen him dying i seen the sun go down i seen the stars refused to shine i know he died i seen the soldier ram the spirit through his heart he died and i know he's dead and how could he do it he trusted in him that we we trusted in him that he would be the great messiah that should take and mul and and would mold all of our spears and pruning hooks and go out and the romans would be finished and the world would be trampled down and he'd rule it with a rod of iron and he sat on david's throne and there he is laying up there in a grave how can it be they just couldn't understand it you know what they were believing in they were believing in the word pounding their pruning hooks their spears and the pruning hooks they were believing the prophecy but they were believing the prophecy out of sequence there's nothing wrong with them believing the prophecy that's good they should have believed in it he's the messiah and the messiah will do these things that's exactly right the messiah will do all of those things they believed he would do but they didn't realize the corner wheat must first go into the ground and die or to bite alone and then the process of the bright tree being cut down and restored they didn't understand that part but what they believed was a hundred percent true and they were good believers for believing it but they didn't realize the process that would come to that he is the messiah that would bring the millennium without a doubt they just wanted to get that part over here i don't even fault them for that what god faulted them for is not believing all that he said jesus never faulted them for believing that that would happen and believing he'd be the great general that would defeat all the armies he never condemned them for that he said oh fools of heart not to believe all that the prophets had said sometimes we get our own idea but praise god there's nothing wrong with believing the word believe it amen i i tell you what if if another worldwide deceased comes sweeping by you know what i'm going to believe it won't touch me i believe it won't touch me and if it touches me i believe he'll heal me and if he chooses to take me home i'll believe it was my time because we're believers we're children of god there's nothing wrong with believing in the full promise of god and knowing knowing that any of the above could happen to me but still i i would rather somebody believe that god will let it not touch them than be fearful and nervous and worried and say oh what if what if what if leave the what if to god just believe for the best believe when you get in your car and pull out believe that you're not going to have an accident believe that you're not going to fall in the financial ruin believe that you're not going to be hungry and begging for bread believe that you're not going to lose your job believe that you're not going to lose your house believe that your children are going to be saved and serve god believe just believe all of those things there's nothing wrong with believing all of it and if god does something different there's nothing wrong with believing that he would do that as long as we don't stop believing in him when he changes our expectation see the problem is they made the statement we trusted it had been that was the mistake that was the mistake not saying i don't understand i thought this would happen first but i know he's the messiah you see what i'm saying i know he's the messiah i know he fulfilled the word i know this is right but i don't understand why this didn't happen the way i thought it would happen i don't understand what's happening but i know he's right and i know he's the messiah and i know he's fulfilling the scriptures can we do that can we say i don't understand what's happening but i know i'm a son of god because that didn't change because my circumstances changed that didn't change because i'm now disappointed in what's happening that didn't change because i had the wrong idea about the future if i was ever a son of god i'm always the son of god i mean if i'm sealed i'm sealed until the day of my redemption i didn't lose my seal because i had the wrong idea or the wrong expectation so don't throw those things away but say you know what i didn't understand i didn't expect this but praise god anyhow he's god and i know he's doing something now he's still the messiah he's still the word he's still my father and i'm still his son he goes on to say no we finished that one they just couldn't understand it thought he would start the throne of david they just couldn't understand it but praise god we don't have to understand it we just have to believe him i want to read a quote to you from it is the rising of the sun talking about brother branham's trip he's here in the rising of the sun 1965 in april when he's getting ready to go to africa and he had longed for years to get back to africa and listen what he says you all know where i'm going don't you africa i've called for a long time for years i've tried to get back now a vision the spirit of the lord has prepared the way listen to what he's saying this is going to be really important and a vision the spirit of the lord has prepared the way they said when those poor natives heard heard it they didn't come the lat that i didn't come the last time when i was there they laid on the ground day and night and moaned and cried saying lord what have we done thousands of them those people don't even believe they got a soul and they cried and they moan and they cry don't you send no word ahead please don't see if that visa would happen to go through there and get amongst the ministers they would stop me right there i have to go in as a hunter i'm going up to the queen that brought up 17 train loads down and come down to the meeting i get to go up and hunt on her territory and i go in my passport and everything calls for a hunter not a religious service then there's going to be one brother meet me say why don't you have a little meeting for us the stadiums are already ran and they don't even know it see oh glory pray that the will of god will not be hindered that my soul that's cried for africa since i've left may i be able to return again then bring you a message of a great meeting what do you think brother branham's expectation was because he had had a vision the leadership of the holy spirit and he had a plan they've already rented the auditorium i'm going in as a hunter boy this is slick he's got it all figured out i'm going in as a hunter my visa don't say no religion it just says hunter i'm going in with sydney jackson and then they've already got it and while i'm here he'll say oh won't you just have us a service it's perfect and when brother ben is preaching it he's getting really excited because he believes his plan is going to work and he believes it's the will of god are you convinced of that [Music] he comes back and the next time he preaches is july 11th ashamed he says i had planned on so hard coming back burned in my heart i just returned from africa as you all know and when i got over there i had a restricted visa and wouldn't let me wouldn't let me preach because it gathers too many together they're expecting an uprising there at any time and they wouldn't let me preach because of that gathering too many people together the only way i could would to have some organization that represented by the government in the government to invite me over then that would automatically let the government send out a militia for protection see there is just going to be an uprising and that's all there is to it it's just right in hand see that government man said the last time you was here you had about a quarter of a million people together and he said then you see that would just be the very thing that communism is looking for for an uprise so i couldn't preach brother branham just told us and it is the rising of the sun that he's going by a vision and the leadership of the lord and that he's going in as a hunter to sneak in don't let any of those ministers know don't let the word get out i've got a good plan i'm going to sneak it in on them auditoriums rent it he's going to say hey since you're here let's just have a meeting amen and right before he leaves he gets a restricted visa he goes on in the shame further on he says and so when i started to go over i'm telling you i never had so much trouble in all my life of trying to get there and then at the very last minute the very last minute to go there was a road across my visa i cannot anticipate in any kind of religious service can only come hunting right across his visa you know what brother branham did obeyed what the law said he went over there to preach the prophet of the age went over there to preach and he's got a scripture that says go into all nations preach the gospel but because caesar said don't do it he didn't do it and we find ourselves in that situation here we're allowed to preach and we're allowed to gather some but we're under restrictions we've got to do it a certain way and we're going to do it a certain way because that's the right thing to do but praise god we can still have people in the sanctuary and we can still preach thank god so anyways he says he goes on to say he said well then it was rank that's about how we would all feel but i said i don't care what the devil does i can't voucher for what brother jackson said about yellow main line and this that or the other i can't vouch it but i i do know god told me see sydney jackson and go hunting see that's the fulfillment of the vision but cindy jackson invited him on a hunting trip and brother branham was praying about getting back into africa and preached and when god said see sydney jackson and go hunting brother bran that's all god told him but brother branham assumed that meant to go back and preach so you can see how the man thought that yes this is i've been praying for years trying to get back in cindy jackson invites i'm laying before the lord what should i do and the lord tells him go sidney jackson go hunting and he says that's it i'm going back to preach now and that was never god's plan but god didn't condemn him for being a human and having his own idea see he said god told me see sydney jackson and go hunting and i said i'm going he said and sometime and i had one of the greatest trips he had one of the greatest trips i found out what the trouble was now now listen oh my this is going to be good friends he goes through this whole scenario where he's trying to get to africa he comes up with a plan he sneaks in god tells him by vision he's going to go hunting and that's to him that equals equals i got it figured out then be right before he leaves they stamp his passport can't participate in religious services hunting only and he says it was rank he says well i don't care what the devil says i'm going anyways because i can't vouch for what sidney said what his vision was or word of the lord i can only say one thing god said sea city jackson go hunting it's unclear what the devil says i'm going hunting anyways then he figures out what the problem was the government told him it wasn't because of what he preached it was because there was going to be an uprising there because of apartheid and the communist movement was moving in and stirring up the people and they didn't want to have big crowds gathered unless they could dispatch the militia and they couldn't do it unless a recognized organization sponsored him so he found out the reason why it wasn't just a religious persecution it was because of the situation in the country at the time so he says and i found out what the trouble was now look what he does next now i think about october the lord willing i can go back and have a meeting and everything now he starts planning another meeting because obviously god worked all of this out so i could figure out the problem solve it so i could come back and plan the meeting and go back and have the meeting i always wanted to have well guess what friends he never went back and he never had that meeting so what he thought was wrong but god didn't condemn him for it he said maybe october i can go back and have a meeting everything full cooperation everything else see in africa now i got to the bottom of it and found out where it was at and what caused it up here writing this one has got to say and something's got something to say and this one here the best thing to do is go find out yourself and i know what the trouble was and what the reason of it was and it was because of so many people gathering together the government wouldn't leave me let me have it now if the christian businessman any organization will bring us in then the government automatically because it's the organization is represented with the government the government sends militia protection if there would be 25 man out of one denomination 25 out of another still that wouldn't receive that it's got to be the head of the organization and the christian businessman is a non-sectarian organization representing all churches dr simon their head over there a very fine man i got to meet him and talk with him and they are taking the meetings and all the rest of the church is coming together see and i believe we'll have one of the greatest meetings that's been had in africa he believed that he was going back because he solved the problem and that he believed that whole scenario go hunting with cindy jackson was to solve this problem so that he could go back and have one of the greatest meetings that had been had in africa and he didn't do it but my point was this when you know that you're trying to do what's right the first thing is if you feel led to do anything then check it with the word and see if it's right with the word and then let nothing stop you i don't care how many wheels the devil throws in your way just move right over the top of them why because if it's wrong god will stop you just like he stopped him but you see that i explained that whole thing to understand brother brennan went through all of that and he had his own idea he said i think i believe i believe we'll get it in october i think well i believe we'll have one and i believe he truly believed that but that wasn't god's plan but you know i i had the privilege of talking to the motifs and brother branham went over to south africa and he didn't have any meetings they wanted him even to mean churches he wouldn't do it because of his visa and when the law said something brother brown didn't break it unless god told him to and he would meet in house meetings and several times there was a man there who drove him around and met with him and his name was willie retief and willie ratif is the father of gideon ratif and willie ratif was the one who really started duplicating messages him and some other brothers and getting them out through the and a lot of the foundation of the message with some of those brothers who were there in those home meetings and it got started right there and the message went out so do you think something great was accomplished absolutely but not in the way even brother branham thought it was accomplished it didn't even happen in the way that brother thought it would happen but it happened the way god intended it to happen and it was so humble and so meek it was like dipping in jordan seven times and it went under the radar and unnoticed even to the prophet but yet god did a mighty thing there in an unexpected way and brother branham was gone over a month um he he was gone over a month out of the ministry no preaching no campaigns no healing he went a couple weeks hunting shot a bunch of game lost his whole itinerary and it looks like a big waste of time except god accomplished exactly what he wanted to accomplish we've got to be able to take god hey if i never in this lifetime understood why i i thought it would happen it didn't happen i don't understand if i never understand it doesn't matter god accomplished something i believe that with all my heart that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord we don't have to understand it we just have to believe him let's go to acts chapter 2. acts chapter 2 and verse 42. we're in the new testament church after we've had the day of pentecost inaugural message to the church and now they're setting up the church people are gathering in and verse 42 says and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need and they continued they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved praise god i like a church like that we may wind up here before it's all over but they sold all they had they laid at the apostles feet they had everything in common and you can see they were rejoicing verse 46 and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house to eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved they were having a good time do you believe that i think they were rejoicing at the move of god they were seeing people added they were seeing miracles work they were they they had no selfishness among them they had given everything up they had it all in common they were living in brotherly love and they were living in harmony by the spirit and the church was led by the spirit of god in imperfect lock step with the spirit and they were enjoying the fellowship they were enjoying the time and can you imagine what their thoughts was this is the kingdom this is the kingdom it's coming and he says you know you know i'm coming back and i'll set up the kingdom and they know the prophecies and now they're seeing it all come together they're all in order all led by the spirit nobody has to tell anybody they come and they give their goods they give their heart to the lord they're all in communion with one another they're all in harmony together oh praise god any day now he's going to return and he's going to set it up the throne here in jerusalem we're all here thousands of us are gathered now it's time but he was gathering them together for a different purpose let's go over to chapter 8. verse 1 chapter 8 verse 1 and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judea and samaria except the apostles right there all their hopes and dreams fell to pieces all their ideas about the kingdom coming about we're going to live this way forever about you know we're all together everything's going to be like this forever isn't this wonderful right here it all was smashed their idea failed their thoughts of the timing of the prophecies failed everything failed but god was right on time brother bam says in the message presuming 1962 said that night on the ground the place where i was talking to the men after i got them over there and was telling them about it a little fellow walked up to me and said how wrong you are i said wrong he said yes sir when you made that statement about the pentecostals back there how the people sold all they had said that was the worst thing they ever done i thought how worldly can you get right and he said that's the worst i said then you mean to tell me that the holy ghost made a mistake what kind of god are you serving if he makes mistakes he's infinite omnipotent omniscient amen sure how can he make a mistake he said i'll prove to you that you're wrong that wasn't the holy ghost i said act of the holy ghost in the bible wasn't the holy ghost he said look i thought all right you brought yourself out here now you just saw your own limb off amen just like putting a rabbit in a pen if you know where every place is and every hole is stopped up and he's got to come back here to get out just stay right here he'll have to come back to him he will put his head in every hole but he will never get through just pin him up stay right there that's the way with one of them just keep moving with the word just take the word in front of you keep moving you got every hole stopped up out there anyhow see just keep moving on moving up i said then the holy ghost made a mistake he said well then people made a mistake i said they were inspired by the holy ghost he said look preacher when the persecution come and the fuss come up among them said that wasn't the holy ghost i said no sir but the holy ghost was in the first move he said when the persecution come up those people didn't even have a home to go to i said that's just what god wanted them to do so they went everywhere preaching the word if they'd had a home they'd have went back to it but god was scattering the message they got a home in heaven see [Music] what was god doing to the first church under the leadership of the holy coast under the apostles teaching they had all things in common they sold their homes they sold their goods they threw it all together they lived together and they thought it was the best thing that ever happened and god was leading them into a trap and they were singing and dancing with joyfully the whole time when everything got just right amen and they thought this would go on forever all of a sudden a great persecution rises in jerusalem against the church and smites them and scatters them everywhere and they carry the message preaching ever because they have no more homes to go to they have no more goods no more possessions they're scattered everywhere and that's exactly god's plan the holy ghost doesn't make mistakes even if it looks like a mistake to the carnal mind that looked wrong but through the spiritual mind which brother branham had he said it was perfect if we believe the holy ghost led us here do you believe the holy ghost led us here do you believe the spirit of god compelled us to continue on then god's in control he's got a plan if others think it's a mistake as long as it's not a mistake to the holy ghost we're fine as long as the spirit of god has led you to where you're at as the longest spirit of god has led me to where i'm at then stand still and see the salvation of god don't throw away the confidence that we have in the leadership of the lord he's led us thus far he'll lead us all the way he's brought us here for a purpose now let's be bold in our faith watching for what god will do i can't figure it out i have no idea but let's just watch for what god will do let's just trust him let's throw all of our trust in him and cast down reasoning and lean not to our own understanding but in all of our ways let's acknowledge him so he can direct our steps he's not lettuce in a mistake this wasn't a mistake it was the plan of god but you wouldn't get their unbelieving family members to believe that they didn't make a mistake by selling the family farm and giving it to the apostles do you understand you realize they had unbelieving family do you realize they were surrounded by an unbelieving church in jerusalem that day do you think the unbelievers around them thought what they were doing was wise you sold your inheritance yeah i don't need it no more kingdom's coming you realize i mean put yourself back in that day this is the move of god this is the spirit supernatural things are happening the other day what do i need a farm for do you understand what i'm saying friends nothing has changed the spirits are the same god just changed the people a little bit different circumstance same story you sold your farm you gave up your job you moved all the way across the country for this it's the kingdom kingdom's coming christ will be here any moment don't you see don't you want to sell your farm no sir i don't want to sell my farm you're crazy and then when the persecution came and got scattered can you imagine what's that those poor people right i knew that was a bad idea i knew they shouldn't have done that i told them i tried to tell him that was wrong praise god anyhow you know what i imagine that they left scattered i imagine they left confused poor with no home not understanding and having no clue what in the world god was doing but every step they were taking was ordained of god running from a persecution with no money no houses no goods no more fellowship with the other believers but just running maybe just their family maybe just a couple people running to another place to find a place of safety and they were step for step in the perfect will of god but everyone around them thought they'd made a mistake and the devil probably was laughing his head off and the his joy over their demise was going to be his demise in every city they went to amen yes sir let the devil laugh now he won't laugh later god's plan is perfect and god's children moved by the spirit of god amen and we've got to have enough maturity about us to say god's still god and he's still sitting on the throne and i'm still his son and the blood's still atoned for me and nothing's changed i don't understand what's happening and i may not like what's happening and it may hurt what's happening and i may cry over what's happening but he's still in control of my life and if god led me and i'm confident he letting me then he didn't lead me in a mistake he led me in his perfect will and everything that looks wrong is going to be made right someday and if in this life i don't understand that i still know it's true see friends there were scorners that day there was mockers there was family there was politicians there was everything you could imagine in that day just like there is in this day but those poor people all they knew to do was love god and do what he said they was it unreasonable to sell their farm yes was it unreasonable to join this new movement it hadn't even had time to be tested like there wasn't a few generations to see if it was kooky crazy was peter going to go off on the deep end a few months that you realize it wasn't tested it wasn't proved they didn't have any data to verify the claims they didn't have history they didn't have pedigree they didn't have anything amen that would justify the reason for giving up everything you've worked hard for all your life and maybe your father and grandfather worked for all their life and throw it away amen just to join something that nobody thinks is right that nobody understands and give yourself totally over to something that looks like it could be crazy and it could all fall apart tomorrow you know what they weren't leaning to their own understanding there had to be something else moving these believers it had to be the spirit of god moving in an ordained seed of god that would respond to the word for that day because nothing else makes sense and then when their whole plan came crashing down when the whole thing crumbled and fell apart they didn't become unbelievers they ran scared they ran away lonely they ran away poor they ran away stricken but they ran away believers because they preached the message everywhere they went so they left destitute they left naked they left without fellowship but they left a believer and everybody laughing at them because what i thought i told you i told you there was a dead end road i told you that was going to come to not i told you that peter didn't know what he was talking about but when they got to whatever place that god led them to it proved what was down in the soul because without peter without the income of everybody else without the fellowship they still preached the message if god decides to close every message church and scatters the believer the real ones will carry the message everywhere they go if they lose houses if they lose lands and they lose fellowship if they lose it all they will still carry the message because that's who they are and they won't cry that god led them into a trap they may not understand they may cry over the suffering but they're not going to blame god say god whatever you want from me is what you're going to get if this is what you want that's what you're going to have and if i have to suffer i have to suffer if i have to look bad in the eyes of my family then i'll look bad if i have to look like an ignorant fool i'll take the way of an ignorant fool as long as i'm standing on your word and as long as i'm following your leadership call me a fool but i'm a fool for christ i don't know nobody has this figured out there's not a person in the world can tell you what's going to happen tomorrow there's not i mean with a virus or no virus nobody can tell you what's coming tomorrow and we've seen things change so fast we have no idea what next week is going to look like but but so somebody tell you you should do this and you should do that forget it all just throw yourself on the hands of jehovah and say god i can't figure a thing out and all the models they show they keep changing so obviously the scientists can't figure it out either so i'm not going to depend on them i'm not going to depend on the government i'm not going to depend on my family i'm not going to depend on my friends i'm going to trust wholly on what you tell me to do is what i will do and if i do what you tell me to do then i've got faith that says you'll take care of the rest we may not enjoy the process but we're going to enjoy the destination he may not do things the way we expect him to but don't ever stop expecting him to do the miraculous don't ever let your diminish just because he didn't work it according to your expectation god you didn't meet my expectation you must be getting ready to exceed it [Music] you didn't do it my way your way must be better it's all the attitude friends we've got to adjust the attitude to keep god on the throne of our lives and not let reasoning brother branham said science is of the devil don't let it be your guide science and education and civilization he said is of the devil don't let that guide you let the word of god anointed by the spirit of god be our only guide it's dangerous to put all your confidence in science civilization education we've got to put all our confidence in him and he'll lead us in places that look terrible don't think god won't take you and put you in the worst of the worst situations he's gone and you belong to him what did he do to the apostle paul what did he do to peter what did he do to the christians to the ages if he wanted to strip them naked and hang them on the cross he did it do you realize we've got to get past the maturity of god loves me he's a good god he won't let anything bad happen to me get past that get past that right now because he wants to make a public mockery out of you he will and he can and if it serves his purpose to make you look like a fool and if it serves his purpose to make you and i look like a public example and a mockery and a shame that's exactly what he'll have and that's exactly what we should give him whatever he takes he can take my life's nothing anyways it's not worth anything it doesn't mount to a hill of beans we just got to surrender to him don't think well god won't let that happen he could let anything happen if it serves his purpose for his glory he'll let it happen don't run away scared when it happens just stand and say you're still god i'm still yours lead me lord because i don't know where to step next and no reasoning is going to help me we have to have faith friends man let's all stand musicians if you could come blake if you could come amen i appreciate so much you few who are able to be here and appreciate so much those who are faithfully pulling across the streaming may god bless you wherever you are i'm looking forward to the day we can all see one another face to face but if god never lets that day come it doesn't change anything i expect that we'll all be gathered back into this assembly again together and i'll see each other face to face but if god doesn't meet our expectation and we never come back together it doesn't change anything god is still gone hold fast to their faith to the profession of your faith don't let it waver believe god despite all circumstances and everything will be just fine amen let's pray dear lord jesus we love you we thank you god for your word for it's a light and to our feet lord it's a lamp into our feet in the light into our path lord so that we can know how to walk god everything you've done and written us for our example help us lord to just be faithful to this word god you've led us in ways so many times that we're confusing to the carnal mind so many ways that made no sense to the eye but god somehow you worked a perfect plan you've brought us through obstacles trials you've taken us sideways and backwards and upside down through everything in life but somehow it's always come out right but we've lived long enough on this life we've served you long enough in this life to know that your plan always works out perfect and god give us faith in this hour to stand the test and to stand the trial no matter what others say lord help us not to lose confidence in you for you have started a good work in us will be faithful to complete it you're the author and finisher of our faith you've brought us this far we're trusting you to take us all the way through god help us not to lean to our own understanding help us not to to look with the eyes the natural carnal eyes but let's look at the eyes of faith and see you in every situation you've armed us you've equipped us now you're asking us to stand you've led us with the pillar of fire by the leadership of your holy spirit and now you're asking us to stand still and have faith in you [Music] god as you would have us to say several weeks ago my father's a good shot lord i still believe you're a good shot god it may look scary it may look like we're defenseless in the open and easy target for the devil an easy target for criticism hatred and malice but god you know and i just want to declare you're a good shot and i still believe it i don't know when you'll pull that trigger i don't know when you'll drop this devil but i believe you will i believe you promised lord that you'll take care of us that you'll lead us in the paths of righteousness for your name's sake that you'll care for us as your children lord that you'll shelter us under your wings and i still believe it's true god help us to hold steady and have faith in you it may look like a trap but there's a tunnel here somewhere there's a path through the water or on the water or under the mountain i don't know where but god somehow you're going to open up a path and you're the only one who's going to get the glory no man will glory nobody will have it figured out but you alone will be worshiped and glorified because you're the only one who knew where the path was i pray to give us faith to stand still and see your salvation for god i know you've led us and you haven't stopped we're trusting you to lead us all the way through god we give you our lives we pray lord that you would bless those who are not feeling well and struggling with symptoms prayed you deliver each one lord prayed you boost their faith lord and that that faith would rise to the occasion lord and i pray that you would take away the symptoms and help them to feel well bless every circumstance lord for your glory may we hold steadfast and watch you work in jesus christ's name we pray amen bless you ever song sing a song for two roses you may take one by side and one by faith take the word of god or what you see what you believe is what will be set your wings
