========================================

he came with grace and majesty he is oh he is a love [Music] god loves [Music] his us his feet is [Music] is [Music] is victorious and as [Music] he broke the sea [Music] oh we are [Music] he broke the sea we are [Applause] we let's all stand this evening you are [Music] here [Music] in this place [Music] you [Music] you are here this place we are changed and you are here among us for we have [Music] in this place [Applause] [Music] me [Music] just raise your hands from this evening have your way in this place holy spirit comes [Music] i want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ it's my privilege to be back here with you all coveted kind of shut everything down but it's gone and we're glad so while you're standing if you'd open your bibles to hebrews the fourth chapter read verses one through ten there is something that god's been dealing with me and so you're going to suffer to listen to that this evening but it's something that i think is necessary for the bride at this hour the subject is learning to rest coming to a place in god where nothing bothers us nothing things will challenge us that's for sure but but we never get upset we we never get discouraged we always just we focus on the end of the road and we just rest realizing what he's able to do so let's read hebrews 4 1-10 it says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into this his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel priests as well as unto them with the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed to enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached enter not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying in david today to song on time as it is said today if you will hear his voice harden out your hearts for if jesus had given them rest and would he not afterward have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his let's pray our most gracious and loving heavenly father it is always our privilege to gather ourselves together one with another and and then lord to be able to sit at your feet and just feed upon the word that you've prepared for us for this evening you've chosen lord to speak through man and has fallen my lot lord to stand before the purchase of your blood and lord that's an awesome responsibility so lord let it not be my words let it not be my thoughts the lord you use me this evening as i lay myself aside tired my mind guide my words and lord let what is spoken be from you the lord this i'm asking in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you can be seated brother branham and he swore by himself he makes this statement concerning jesus christ he said jesus christ no matter if he was in a storm and the gale was knocking the boat about from side to side from one side to the other or he was standing in the mess in the face of a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he just walked right along just as calm and as quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear of anything around him that's right whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because god had said so he didn't say oh i wonder if i prayed through i wonder if i fasted long enough i wonder if this he just walked right along on unconscious that's right he believed what god was said was true the words must be fulfilled and he know that his life was to fulfill them that's right when we when we look at this idea of rest it talked about here when we were reading in hebrews it talks about having faith and without faith it's impossible to please god but without faith it's impossible to rest because rest produces a trust well actually a trust produces a faith and then when we get to the place we can trust him then we can relax then we can rest and this is what god's been trying to try and trying to teach me i guess if you will over the last couple of years but we when we when we when we look ahead and we begin to to look at the at the idea of faith because faith to me now means something totally different than what it did even two three years ago faith is not striving to believe for something no faith is a way of life faith is entering into a relationship with god in which you take your total trust and you put it in him and ask him to guide your life and once you take your hand and you place your hand in his from that point on you trust that he will lead you he trusts that you will guide you we were over we're staying at where i guess that was maybe at the youth camp we had this one child and he was playing like all children do he was probably three maybe four at the most i guess and he slipped and fell what's the first thing he did he ran to daddy he ran to his father and his father picked him up and picked him up and said oh it's all right son it's all right you know and he began to console the child and the child whimpered a little bit and after a while put the child down he ran off and started playing again but he knew that if he could get to father he knew everything was going to be fine he knew father was there to guard him he knew the father was there to protect him and so that's where he ran but see where do we run when something happens in our life where do we run we read and there's a there's a there's uh brother branham in a in the upon the obama of gilead he makes an interesting statement here which i thought was which meant a lot to me when i read it he said one thing that we have to move up to now is supreme is a supreme faith to that what we have had something that he says you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you're doing when you understand like you he says you say well i'm going to go home i'm going to go out and start the car he said that's all an act of faith tomorrow i will meet you at a certain place it's all an act of faith it's because you have just done it so much it's become a regular routine with you well that's the way things are with god after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just like a regular routine and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way it'll be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plan of god but see when it talks about here it talks about arresting it talks about coming to the place in your life that you have walked with god so much until it's just a regular routine with you um it was a couple of years ago i brother or paul he makes in this thing he says the just shall live by faith and i okay but then the reference goes back to havoc two and four and so i i took the book of havoc it's only three chapters it wasn't exact you know it's not a big big book but at all but have a cook lived in the time in which in which the assyrian army was going to come and invade and invade judah israel had already fallen i think about a hundred years prior to this point in time god had taken habakkuk and he showed him all the sins of the people of the priests and all the things going on his righteous indignation rose up within himself and god why don't you bring judgment why don't you do something why don't you condemn these people and god says okay i'm gonna bring the chaldeans in and we're gonna and i'll judge them and have a cook had second thoughts because the the chaldeans were the assyrians he says they weren't nice people they killed because they enjoy killing they like to take people and they like to make them suffer and have a cook began to go in his mind he says if these people come and invade my country what will happen to me will i be able to sustain this will i be able to survive the onslaught that is coming and i look at the life we're living around here now we don't really know what's coming all i know is it's going to get worse i don't like our president i'll say that up front but god put him there because this nation must fall all the things going on around us in our in our government is to make this this nation fall make it to falter make it to the place where the the the the debt creates the point where there is no way to sustain there's no way to even pay on the the interest on the debt you look at what's going on on the west coast and they're having a severe drought it's so bad that they're thinking of shutting down some of the hydroelectric plants because there's hardly enough water to be able to run them right now they're having fires all over in the west coast and and then we look at the east coast we have massive floodings we have places new york city they have the problem with the subway because they couldn't get to the train because they had to wade way steep in water just to be able to get to the tracks and you go and you look at the tornadoes and you look at the and they have right now they have a hurricane or just they just had one that's the earliest one on record for for for a number of years why all of these things coming because our nation is under judgment the only thing preventing the judgment of god is the fact we are still here when we leave what you see around us going on all the the lawlessness the murders the rapes and the stuff going on in the big cities all of a sudden that'll be child's play compared to what happens when when all of a sudden god takes us out of here but we're seeing the beginnings of all of all of this but what happens to us i know i i in india when the covet hit i preached a sermon to them or something close to the about havoc i says where do you put your trust what are you trusting in when all of a sudden if you have nothing and there was a point in time in india where really they had nothing i told brother freddie the brother i work with i says take the money that's in the kitty make sure that people have food go out into the villages buy them their food get them the rice get them whatever they need to sustain them during this period of time in the in their lives because when india shut in send india down in one night they shut down the airlines they shut down the taxi service they shut down the buses and they shut down the train if a guy was a hundred miles from home he had to walk it just to get home there was no other means of transportation and what are you going to do what are you going to do but here again coming back to where we are what are we going to do tomorrow all of a sudden because coveted what did they do they shut us down they said the businesses down they said they made it to the hospitals yeah my wife was i think she was sick and anyway we were thinking well if they take her to the hospital that's the last i'll see her because they wouldn't let anybody go in with her we had a brother in our church he caught coven and he was having trouble breathing and his wife looked at him and says you're not breathing well he says no i'm having struggled it's hard for me to breathe she says should i take you to the hospital he said no he says if you take me there he says the only thing you'll see maybe is a black bag coming out on the back he says i have to die let me die at home but then the prayer requests went out for the people in the church and all and everybody began to pray they lifted them up before god god spit god spared him and yeah it took him a month to be able to get his strength back and even now he he still suffers some from that we had a brother who translates for me in india he came down with covid and they put him in intensive care he was there for over for about a month i think he said and intensive care is not like you have here or it's a single room no it's it's like the vest of you out there where you you pack 40 beds out there and and everybody just kind of lays right next to each other um and and he would get up in the morning and and uh yeah they would be wheeling four or five people out to go ahead and cremate them because they had died that evening and they reel half a dozen more in and then every day he saw people being wheeled out because they had died and the doctor came to him and looked at his chart and looked at the lab results and he wondered why are you still alive he said you should be dead and later on when they finally released him he says you realize it's only the prayers of the people that only the prayers of the people that have sustained you during this time so even the hindu doctor had to had to acknowledge the fact god was the one that kept him alive but we come in here in this book in habakkuk because havoc here again he was concerned about himself and god in habakkuk 2 and 4 makes this interesting statement he says behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith and i studied that because it to me it was interesting the way that it was worded and it says in the soul that is lifted up i was looking that up i guess it was yesterday because i really wanted to get a clear understanding he said he whose soul is lift he who in he whose soul is he whose soul is not right in him or lifted up places himself in a fortress or a tower to set himself on high they are away from the enemy and does not return to god nor seek deliverance from him in other words i can do it myself i do not need your help and that's the attitude of too many people well i can do this i can do this i'm trained how to do this i know how to no offense to you guys that are mechanics i know where to put the gas in and after that i let take it to the to the dealership and you know they they i never even looked at my engine for the first few months i'm assuming there was one in there because the car ran but but here again sometimes we come to the place where i can do this i'm trained to do this but we have a brother in our church mike orders and i think he'll mind me mentioning this but he he was in charge of a substation up in in our area and he would all of a sudden he would get a call and they would say hey there's something wrong something wrong with one of the lines or something wrong with one of the transformers or whatever they have in in there and he would go in there and he would look and he would look and he would read all the gauges and he would look at this and he says lord i don't know what's wrong there's something definitely wrong but i really don't know what it is lord will you show me and god did then he would go over and he would call up the lady who handles something else in a different place and says we need to shut down this line but that'll shut down electricity for 10 000 people he says i really don't care shut it down so i can fix this and i listen to a testimony when i was a brother for the jeff coats the guy works at uh at the airport there in i think it's it's columbus i think it is and they were having problems with one of their computers and they could not figure they tried this and tried that and tried this and tried that and and he said you know and he just happened to walk by where all the ground wires were connected he bumped one and it just popped right out that ground wire for that computer was not connected they put the wire in there they sensed it back down the computer ran fine but here it's god doing and he had to acknowledge because none of them could figure out with all their brain power and all of their training and all their phds and whatever else they had they could not come to the understanding this is what is wrong the ground wire is loose and some of them had even checked it but obviously they didn't check the right one but here again if you come to the place in your life so i can do this myself that's what you've come to in this command i i can do this god i don't need your help and whenever you get to the place where you say god i don't need your help he just backs off and says go okay go for it but it talks about he if it talks about but the just shall live by his faith and this is a real interesting statement because it talks about a man that has a total reliance on god it's not just believing for something but this is an actual way of life where the creature is totally dependent upon the creator we have a little dog at home and when he sees the bottom of his bowl he comes and he nudges us and says hey my bowl is empty even though it had food in it still he says fill it up come on fill it up he relies on us because we have the food he doesn't have any access to it unless we provide it for him but i mean here there's a total reliance upon us to feed him but now we have to take and transfer that between us and between god do we come to the place where we have a total reliance upon him how many got up this morning why because god got you up there's no reason you had to get up you could have died last night you know i mean that that's assembled how many ate today because god provided it how do you you guys have jobs how why do you have jobs because god provided it if we begin to understand it's god doing for us it's god supplying our needs where really the reliance we have to have is on god so when we get up in the morning we say oh god thank you you've given me another day lord let me use this day to worship you lord let me use this day to praise you lord let me use this day to lift you up and exalt your name let others see christ in me and when as we go about our daily life um we last year we couldn't go anywhere and so we had 15 years we'd been in our house and we managed to keep the grass so you could actually find the house but i we figured it's time to actually do some yard work and so i went ahead and for for all summer long i mean they kept lows open and i used them quite a bit this summer last summer but it was but now i like to water my yard it takes me three hours sometimes four and say oh that's a waste of time no it's not because it slows my life down such that i can go and i can look at the beauty of the flowers we put in last year i can sit there and listen to the birds we're singing i can sit there and watch the squirrels they run here and as they run there and as they do their daily thing i can watch the little rabbits as they scurry across the path and i can i can i can begin to see the nature i can begin to see the creation which god himself has made i prayed once i said lord slow my life down so that i could i can observe you t where you can teach me something about the surrounding thing and we were driving i think it was in arizona and we're going through a valley down there and god and god kind of spoke to me says look around and i said yeah there's trees there's grass there's flowers there's all this beauty and he said where would you rather be would you like to be on the mountain where there's no grass where there's no trees where there's nothing or would you like to be down the valley where there's water and there's green grass and you can rest underneath the green trees and you can sit there by the watering brook which where would you rather be well some people think valleys are bad things to go through uh they may not all be that bad because that's a place you can rest it's a place you can relax it's a place you can actually enjoy some of the things which god has given you know when we take and we we begin to look at faith and then we begin to go into hebrews the 11th chapter we begin to read all these people abraham and and and isaac and jacob and all the other stories of the people that are in there we read them as stories they had to live it it wasn't a story to them they didn't have a bible they did not have anything to reference them they did not have anybody they could consult with god's god in his own in his sovereignty he began he approached abraham and he began to talk to him and i said abraham i want you to leave your family i want to leave everything behind i want you to go into a sit to a country that i'm going to show you and abra but he didn't tell him where but oh but this was the beginning of abraham's relationship with god his father tote sojourned up to a place called hair herron i think it was and his father finally died and then and then abraham and lot journeyed out into palestine but palestine when he got in there all of a sudden god said this is the land i'm going to give you and it was during a drought and abraham says this land so he journeyed on to egypt he journeyed on where he could you know egypt is a type of the flesh egypt is a type of you rely upon yourself and so he journeyed down into there and and but god created circumstances in his life which drove him back into palestine and then from that point on that's where he resided but god also told him he says until you separate from your brother or your from lot he says i can't bless you and so they were having and here again god created the disturbance between between abraham's uh flock of herdsmen and and and lots herdsmen and so all of a sudden they had this contention going going between them and abraham says hey look at we don't need to fight there's plenty of land out here you go to the right i'll go to the left you take the north i'll take the south let's not fight so what did this lot do he looked down into the sodom it was well watered it was easy living abraham had to stay up in the mountains up in the on the hill country where it was harder i mean there was water there were springs and stuff like that but you had to move your flocks and stuff like that from point to point to keep them watered and to be able to grow your crops but lots lot chose the easy road but also that brought his destruction abraham was there in abrah and and and and during all of this time god and abraham was developing a relationship where all of a sudden abraham came to god one day and he says look i'm getting old you said my children are going to inherit this but i don't have any children and the only one they would inherit would would would be eliezer my servant and god says no it's going to come through your wife sarah he said well okay how will i know this so god says i'll tell you what we're going to do i says do what you normally would do with with your countrymen when you make us when you make a covenant he said go and take an animal kill the animal take some other animals and put them in there and these and normally speaking one would sit in one half of the carcass one would sit on the other half of the carcass and they would make an agreement the agreement being that if you don't fulfill your part of the agreement you will become like the sacrifice you will die and so what happened was abraham sat there and then all of a sudden a light came through i don't have it in my notes so i'm kind of going by memory but a light came through there and and god was telling to abraham really you should go to hell but he says i'm going to give you the land i'm going to provide for you i am making a covenant with you and and i will keep that covenant i will see to it that you're blessed and so the god so that there was an establishment that was there but here again it had to come a relationship had had to be established between abraham and between god to the place where abraham could rest and when all of a sudden god told eight god told abraham take your newborn take your son take him up on the mountain and sacrifice him it had come to their relationship at that point in time where abraham was willing to take his son take him up unto the mountain and offer him as a sacrifice he believed that even if he was reduced to ashes god would restore him completely and they could go back down the mountain and return that is the relationship which god and abraham had had come to in in in the relationship between the two of them but see this is where we have to come sometimes oh things are being difficult here so yeah what do we do we head for egypt oh yeah i know how to do this i know how to do that i can take care of myself and so god creates circumstances to drive you out of that situation and to drive you back into a relationship with him where no longer will you rely upon yourself but you rely upon upon god we go and we look at another one's called david david was out there he was minding his own business taking care of the sheep and a lion came in and grabbed one of the sheep well um i don't like chasing after animals especially when they're bigger than i am but david ran after that he took his sling he killed the lion he rescued the lamb i don't know how much longer but all of a sudden the bear came in and did the same thing and so david went out there and he killed the bear why did he have to go through that he had to come to the place of his trust in god so when it came to goliath david would know that god had the ability to sustain him god had the ability to deliver him so that was a trial in david's life but see we go through trials in ourselves we get sickness comes upon us what do we do we have to learn to trust in god we have other circumstances arise in our lives what do we do we have to learn to trust in god and over time those circumstances and our interaction with god should bring us to the place where we learn to rest in him david was sitting there minding his business and taking care of the sheep one of the servants came out today and said hey your dad wants to see you need to head home so david says well okay so he meanders on home and and he says he opens the door there's this funny old man with his horn of oil and pops the cork i think of the cork takes it off and dumps his oil on top of david and says here the next king of israel david says huh and turned right around went back to feeding taking care of the sheep but then what happened all of a sudden god put an evil spirit upon saul and then and then somebody says hey do you know some of you can play some music to kind of quiet me down well yeah we hear there's this kid he knows how to play flutes and head of stringed instruments and that kind of stuff well go get him so all of a sudden david was brought before saul and he began to play music and stuff like that but then he could observe what was going on within the court he could begin to observe how do you rule a nation how do you have to govern how do you do this and the other it was the beginning of his education and then all of a sudden a war with the philistines rose up david was sent home back to the shape his brothers went down to the down to the valley and they began to fight with the philistine and his dad was concerned about his brothers and says hey why don't you go and see how it's going see how your brothers are doing and so david said well okay so he went there and all of a sudden this big man stands up there and makes his boats you one of you come out there you kill me he says and he says all of us will become your servants but if i kill you then you all have to become our servants and david listen to that he said who's this uncircumcised philistine he doesn't trust in the god that i know he doesn't trust in the god that delivered the lion and the bear into my hands he doesn't trust in the same god that feeds us and supplies our needs he doesn't trust in that god no he relies upon himself so david went before saul and says i can take care of this guy and saul looked at him and said well you're kind of a young man i don't i don't know if you should be doing this tried to put all of his metal armor and stuff on him well david was a short man saul was tall so he looked like a banny rooster i think brother bannon talked about he said i don't know what this stuff does he said let me go with what i know so he went he got some stones put him in the slate put him in a little pouch that he carries with him and then when when goliath got up there and made his big boats and david all of a sudden he ran towards goliath and goliath says ah i'm going to take and feed you to the birds and david says no he says i'm going to take your head off and as he ran toward there he picked up a stone he put in this thing and swirled around and let it go god directed that stone to make that stone go and penetrate where it had to penetrate and and goliath was knocked over and then then david took the goliath sword took it out of its teeth and cut elias head off but he had to be trained there had to come a place in his life where he had such a relationship with god that he could trust where he could rest and rest is based upon this trust you know you know and here again when we come and we look at i look at brother branham's life when brother branham was born he was a prophet he was born to be a prophet there was a gift placed in him angel would talk to him when i think it was a couple three years old or something like that and began to warn him tell him about some things but david but brother branham didn't understand any of this and and he was a renegade i mean he carried a sidearm and he was going to shoot some kids and to beat up on him and then he was going to take the one that killed his dog and him if he had if his dad hadn't stopped him he probably would have gone and killed that man but here again then god began to deal with with brother branham and says you have to accept me you have to come to a relationship with me and dave and brother branham refused that he refused him until finally one day god brought him down to the place where he was dying and brother brown says okay if you'll spare my life i'll serve you and from that point on god began to deal with him more that's when the visions became more act more active that's when you know different things began to change in his life but he he just became a christian he went to the church he went to because that's where hope was hope was the draw i mean he admits to that and uh but finally he got married and and things were going and he started he he couldn't agree with the baptist doctrine so he began to establish his own church and he just rented i think some some some hall or something like that but he be all he was was a baptist preacher but he kept getting visions and he says what are these visions but he knew that every time he had a vision it was true every time he followed the vision it was true he came to the place he began to to to believe in those visions he began to come to the place he knew he could trust those but he was still a baptist preacher until finally one day all of a sudden he got tired of all the stuff that was going on and he says i have to find out what's going on because either god will either meet with me and take this away from me or else i'll die that's when the angel came and says you're going to take a gift of divine healing around the world he said really so then he with that in mind he began to go out and begin to have healing meetings and uh the angel says nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer and so here again but he so he he says well okay i have this gift so he began to use it but the angel says that is the wrong way to use it he said that's god a god has placed a gift in you it's for god to use not you but you see he began to advertise bring the hard one bring the lame bring the halt bring the blind bring the death come and watch god perform miracles and after four or five meetings or whatever it was god had to teach him a lesson he so he got up there and he made the head of prayer line and god just left he began to pray and god didn't hear that prayer the guy he came up and he left the way that he came he prayed for the next when the guy left worse i think the third one came up i think was the child if my memory serves me right brother branham realized god's not in this and so he set the meeting down then he went back and the angel said i told you don't do this and he had to come back i think he even referred himself as balaam he said he had to repent he had to repent because he was doing what was wrong but once he took the gift and gave it to god he said then it worked the way god had intended it for it to work but see that's the way with ministers the gift god places in the minister is not for the minister it's for you people we come and we study and we pray and we say lord we need your anointing we need your inspiration and and sometimes the inspiration comes and there are the times we wish it had and sometimes we wish that we could preach it under the same inspiration we had when it was given but here but but we we have no control of this we have no control over this and brother batman says it's you people that activate the gift it's you people that draw on it in some places i've been at and i get up my my texts and i start preaching and all of a sudden the people get excited they begin to draw and i can't keep up with it the other places i go and it's i don't ever i was at one place and it rained a lot and we had to clear this area and so it had a lot of mud and so they gave me this big shovel and so you're shoveling mud and shoveling mud is very tedious very hard and you don't accomplish anything okay it just kind of oozes around and sometimes that's what some services feel like i'm pushing mud you know but here again but regardless of that we're here to to do something and we we pray and we ask god god you have to intervene you have to take control you have to bring the inspiration you have to give us the words when we go back and we look at david david was in in his life yeah all of a sudden he went out and killed some philistines and saul got jealous and then david had to go and run for his life but there was something that stuck with him all during that time of when when he was running away from saul he said i have been anointed to be the king over israel and i have but i have to wait for god's timing to place me there but see we have been called to rule and reign with jesus christ that is our calling it's a spiritual kingdom that we rule and reign over it's not a physical kingdom but we have to be trained we have to come to the place where we have enough trust and faith in god that we can begin to do what god would instruct for us to do when i was in the baptist church they taught you you know mind over matter you know you believe and maybe god will and maybe god won't but in this message that we hear from here we understand god has given us the authority not the power but the authority we have the authority because of who we represent i represent jesus christ i am not him but i represent him because i represent him and if god anoints me in such a way that whatever i speak it has to it can be god and therefore we can cast demons out we can heal the sick we can raise the dead because it's not us it's the god that's in us he is the one doing these things and this is what we have to come to the realization we do not have to we do not have to we do not have to bring to pass the the promises that obligates god and if we can come in we can we can pray and we can come under the inspiration and the anointing of god then god is obligated by his own word to fulfill his word for in in our lives in christ the mystery of god revealed brother branham says if there was three things god wanted to accomplish he's at first to express himself completely god in christ and he did that but you have to realize what did jesus christ was a man he had passions like we all have he had desires like we all have he if he got hit or cut himself he would he'd bled if if he got bumped or something like that he hurt if he felt all the pains that we feel brother brown i think in in the story of anyway there's a story that he talks about he says you know brother jesus christ of god and simply place and all of a sudden he bowed his head because he had a severe headache and i can't think of the book right now but anyway it's irrelevant but he was a man he he suffered in everything the same way as we do but but he had he had come to the place like we read there in the beginning no matter what came on around him he never he never varied he knew who he was he knew that he came for a purpose he knew that god was going to do something for him he knew that he there was a cross waiting for him these are all the things that he knew but and so he just rested believing that god would direct his path he said one place he told the disciple i have need to go by way of samaria samaria is not the way to jericho no it's not but i have needs to go by that way he was in there after he had been preaching he told the disciples we're going to go to the other side and after he was exhausted he went to the boat he laid down and went to sleep and all of a sudden the storm came up and the disciples came back oh we're all going to drown look at the water's coming into the boat we're all going to die we're all going to perish and he looks around he says no no no we're not where's your faith i told you we're going to the other side nothing's going to stop us from getting there he said peace be still and the winds and the waves obey him but see he knew who he was he knew what his calling he knew he had an appointment on the other side he knew that satan could not stop that but see we have to come to the same realization in our life satan cannot stop the plan of god you know the only one that can stop god's plan is you by you unwilling to do as god directs you can stop god it's that simple we had a brother in our church they'd operate on his elbow and uh the operation was successful that he got an infection well they treated them for infection they irrigated it they opened it back up and flushed it with this that and the other put them on more antibiotics and stuff and it seemed to get better and then it got worse well you can only do that so many times and then the damage to that joint becomes excessive and there's nothing that more they can do and then god spoke to me and he says go pray for him but he's in a hospital in charlotte charlotte's a terrible city to drive in i don't want to go to charlotte but you have to go well okay so i went i found where the hospital was i'd been there a couple of times before that's why i knew it was terrible parking lots all that stuff but i found a place to park found out what room he was in went there we talked for a little bit and i says do you know why i'm here he said well no not really i said god told me to come here and pray for you we're dealing with a spiritual battle not a physical one oh so i prayed not that my prayers any better than anybody else's but god directed me so i went i prayed the infection cleared itself up and everything was fine but if i had refused he might have lost his arm i mean you understand where i'm coming from on this you can stop god so if god is directing you to do something do it like that one lady that she had given her seat over to a lady that had a sick child and she went and and as she was walking up to the balcony and god told her you go pray for the baby oh but brother branham's gonna pray she has a prayer card and they and the god says no you go pray for that baby well okay and so she went on i'm sure she was quiet i'm sure she was very respectful i'm sure in a very nice cords away i'm sure she she said would you mind if i prayed for your little baby oh no that'd be nice so she about her head she said a simple little prayer and then she went up to the balcony and then the child of the mother and the child was called before brother branham and brother banham looked at the baby and says well there's nothing wrong with this child and then god showed him what had happened he pointed the lady up in the balcony and says lady he said your prayer healed this boy this baby he said you at being a mother you could have compassion on this child or maybe i wouldn't and thank you for obeying god but see here again it's not it's not wrapped up in the prophet it's not just limited to him and to him only i hear too many people oh if the prophet was only here oh if the prophet was only here no he's not but god is and he's the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't need the prophet to operate through he needs you because you are his body you are the one that he dwells in but he has to get preeminence he has to get the same control in us that he did in jesus christ and what was in jesus christ there was a relationship there where no matter what came against him no matter what the situation was he never feared he never became anxious he never worried he'd ever he just said well lord i'm here because you sent me here now lord what do you want me to do but see that's how it has to come in in our lives then that havoc speaks of is not faith in itself but a real true confiding confiding faith it's one of a relationship of the creature to the creator it's an unshaken trust it's like a little child putting his hand in the hand of his father he trusts his father he has no reason not to trust his father if i can only get to daddy daddy will take care of me if i can only get to daddy daddy is stronger we had the deal when i was a young kid my daddy's bigger than your daddy my daddy can beat up your daddy you know my dad was wise enough not to get entangled in that kind of a nonsense but you know that's the faith i had in daddy okay but here again but we have to understand this is this is the relationship that god is trying to get us to have with him and even in havoc even though he he wrestled with this thought he said the chaldeans come he says what's going to happen to me can i survive the onslaught can i survive the destitute could i survive depending upon the outcome of these battles in habakkuk 3 it says when i heard my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottnest entered into my bones and i trembled in myself that i might rest in the day of trouble when he cometh up unto the people he will invade when he invaded with his troops he was i mean he was scared but he goes on although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olive shall fail the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls though be we be destitute though he has nothing yet i will rejoice in the lord i will joy in the god of my salvation and that sound and that's in when i when i studied that that one verse up there it's the strongest way that they could possibly express this in the hebrew language it talks about i will not only rejoice but i will shout and i will dance and i will jump and i will praise him with with all with everything that is within me i will worship him as if i had everything i will join and rejoice and give glory and honor to god as if as if i was possessive of all things what he possessed did not dictate to him his relationship with god and this is where i was trying to tell the ones in india because we don't know what's going to happen there i mean there were times the people they had no food freddie went to get oxygen for his mother because she came down with coburn it was fifty dollars to get a tank of oxygen for two days their economy cannot you cannot sustain that i managed to send them some money and hopefully it helped out but here again it freddie had the cash but a lot of people didn't what were they going to do they couldn't get the oxygen because of the government because of what the government had done but see this is this is where we have to come in our relationship this is where we have to come in and trust i was reading when i in church which sometimes i just open my bible and read before the song service and stuff and in in psalm in isaiah excuse me 31 1-3 it said woe to those that go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and a horseman because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek either seek the lord yet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will rise against the house of the evil doers and against the help of them that work iniquity he said now the egyptians are men and not god their horses are flesh and they're not spirit and that struck me when i read that and then god began to deal with me on that why where do i trust him where do i put my trust what do i lean upon when i have a need we were flying to india uh this was last 2019 i think it was and uh we got we we flew into london made a connection and surely we have to take off then about an hour later they begin to serve food and they delivered the food and surely wasn't touching hers at all i mean it's not the best it's not you know not what it used to be it's put that way but i said why aren't you eating she says i have a terrible terrible headache oh first reaction okay we're about six hours from hyderabad uh we'll get there we got pills but they're in the luggage you know in the body of the ship of the plane and uh so i will get you some pills land you go to bed you'll get to get some sleep and it'll you know it'll go away and then god reminded me of this he said why did he go to egypt why why do you rest in yourself why do you trust yourself why do you trust your abilities i mean i worked in the hospital laboratory for 20-something years 40. oh wow that many okay but i know medical science i i know how to read the charts i know what the numbers mean within a certain range anyway and so when when we go to the doctors um the fact the doctor told me i was overprotective of her because every time they're gonna do something i ask questions and i ask lots of them if i don't like the answers i want another opinion okay i mean that hard to get along with i know but god was telling me why do you rest why do you trust yourself why don't you trust me this time well i didn't have any choice really i said well okay lord so i put my hand on hers and i said lord we're going because you have called us to go we don't have access to the medications we normally bring along but lord you're asking me to trust you you're asking me to believe you you say you are the god that heals and lord now i'm in need of that healing from my wife then an hour or so the headache began to subside by the time we land in the higher bed it was totally gone but see god was testing me when we were there um they slammed their brakes on a couple times and threw shirley around like a doll in a in a windstorm and then they we went over and we hit a dip once and even with a seat belt on her head hit the roof of the car and gave her a concussion and so on that trip really she suffered a lot in that trip but when she hit the top roof of the car i looked over and she had a concussion i said well lord we need you now. and so i reached my hand back and prayed and i watched you know okay the symptoms began to subside but see all along on that trip god was trying me do you trust me will you rely upon me you're going to run to egypt every time there's a problem or you will or you'll rely upon me this time and it's coming to the place in a lot of things we have to rely upon god my opinion for whatever it's worth it's going to get worse in this country it's going to come to the place where we may not have food it's going to come to the place we may not have fuel it's going to come to the place where where we could be basically destitute of all things i know all it takes is you have to sit there and crush one of the pipelines going across the mississippi uh well you people have things here where they can process oil and make make petroleum make gasoline out of it where i live they don't there was one time a few years back when they had to shut the refineries down it was two months before we could we could regularly get gas two months and even then it was it was rationed it could happen again it could make it so you all you have nice beautiful cars and they sit in your in your driveway and you know if unless you want to push it to work you're going to have to walk but i mean we don't know tomorrow we literally do not know tomorrow another example we all my brother he had plans for his retirement and uh he was making all of his preparations and he figured he was going to wait till a certain year and he was going to retire and get so much social security and had money in retirement and this that and the other then he had a heart attack and that changed his life i'm his wife he had appendicitis they took it out and then thanksgiving day all of a sudden he started having pains and she called up her brother which is a doctor and described the symptoms she says get him to the hospital now so she drove him into the emergency room and a doctor was prepping himself to do a heart cath on a patient they looked at my brother and five minutes at a time they went into the emergency room he was on the table that saved his life that gave him a one one heart cath on on the friday or i think it was the friday and then monday they had to give him put another stint in and uh after he had visited for us a while they put a third in but he had he didn't have any energy his heart there just wasn't the flow and then one day in church he was sitting there and he said he could stand up for the first song he may make it through the second before he'd have to sit down because he was exhausted and then god just spoke and says raise your hands and praise me so he did he saw the doctor the following week and he said your heart's as good as a 20 year old but see here again god god spared his life and then god healed him and now he preaches that was not part of his retirement ideas but but see god had to get his attention and god had to do something in his life to go ahead and and create circumstances in his life or all of a sudden now god could use him for what god wanted him to do okay and so this this is something you know that we all have to learn but like i say god was trying to teach me he says rely upon me don't rely upon what you can do don't rely live upon your own knowledge don't rely upon your own abilities yeah i mean i can do some things i i will admit to that but like like the brother like like the brother mike orders he had he he knew electricity i mean he'd been doing it for what 40 years he knew the substation he knew every wire was but he had to rely upon god to be able to fix things anyway it goes on when we talk about it in hebrews 4 like we were reading he said let us therefore fear it means be cautious be watchful be on guard it's not being feared well i'm afraid i'm afraid no it's pay attention look at the things around you analyze what is going on around you be be mindful of these things he said lest a promise that was left us of entering into this rest we we seem to come short of it we don't enter into that for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that hurt it and it's the faith not trying to believe for something but it's faith as a relationship it's faith as as a relationship between you and between god because only then can you rest because only when i we have a car and because of my relationship with the dealership i trust them they have never done me bad they've always treated me well they've always done what i have asked for them to do and sometimes they go the extra mile and they'll do something for me that i have not asked them to so i trust them but that trust came as a result of interacting with them on numerous occasions i was talking to one brother in another church and he said yeah he bought a he bought a honda and they tried to rip him off from the day one so he doesn't have any faith in that and that okay but faith is is based upon a relationship it's having if you have faith in someone because you trust them i mean there are some people i i'm i'm a simple-minded person i take everything at face value and somebody told me that's a dangerous way to be because people take advantage of that and i've learned that also but here again but if if i can come to the place with a relationship with a person where i have trust where i can trust them then i have faith that they will do what they say they will do okay but this is the relationship like i say that we have to come with god it goes on to verse three for we which have believed or we which to have trust we do enter into rest and so here again like i say to me this rest is based upon our ability to have faith and to be able to trust in god and if you trust him that'll if you trust in him that gives you the faith to believe in in him when you look at the people that into the promised land god had taken and delivered the children of israel out of egypt to them god was the god of history god was the god of abraham isaac and jacob they did not know that god but he said well i wasn't god sent to moses and all of a sudden moses comes along and says god has sent me to deliver you oh really yeah so the first miracle that the thing that they had brought judgment upon them all you guys are getting lazy and stuff like that so you guys have to go and get your own straw to build your own bricks and that made them so they really didn't have any confidence in moses but they but god began through moses to perform certain actions to bring judgment upon egypt and then they began to understand the god of abraham isaac and jacob they began to understand the might and the power that this god possesses and then god would come to long and and they brought him to the red sea and oh you know this is they began to cry oh you brought us out here to die you brought us out here to die better we just go back into egypt and we and you know become slaves all over again and then god spoke to moses and moses cried out to god what do you want me to do now what do you want me to do now what do like all these people grumbling and griping and complaining and moses says god says moses just to settle down boy he said take your rod smite the water it'll part oh okay so he did but here again it comes to the relationship but too often i find that people when they get into bad situations where do they run back to egypt they would rather go back to slavery to egypt than they would the freedom which god will give them if they would learn to trust in god and rest in god god says i will take care of you i will provide for you in fact that's the way i read this thing in habakkuk god if i put my trust in you if i totally take my life and i give it to you you are now under an obligation to take care of me because now you become my father and you're the one that has promised to take care of me and that's how i look at it i mean i might be interpreting this scripture wrong but that's what i've told god okay but see why did god send us a prophet why all of a sudden in in our generation did we see miracles and manifestations from god that the churches could never produce why could brother branham on thousands and thousands of times discernment and he would tell the people this what you're praying for this is your disease and all of a sudden he said everybody be quiet and bow your head because there's a demon here we have to deal with and he would cast the demons out and over and over and over again this happened to the place oh yeah if we can only get in touch with brother branham well if we can only get in touch with brother brown but brother branham was saying no no it's not me it's god and one place he says i was there i was just standing there in the river when he when the angel the light came down i was just standing there when he used my voice i was just standing there when he healed this person i would just happen to be the one standing there when god did this and this and this and this but see where does that god dwell today where is he now but he dwells in you and this is what we have to rely upon you know another thing i studied brother brown's life and ministry a couple years ago now and it was interesting brother branham went from a baptist preacher you know and he was studying through the bible and he looked at what a prophet was and he looked at how god was dealing with him and says i must be a prophet and so he began to acknowledge that so he stepped into the office if i could use it that way of a prophet and then then when the discernment started coming and all of a sudden he realized this the same way that god did with with abraham and sarah and then he began to expound upon this he began to relate to that so then he stepped into that office he used to say that billy graham was it was malachi 4. until after he preached the church ages when when when five i think of the visions that he had had come to pass i think it was that many yeah and he so he's oh we're at the end times five of the visions have been fulfilled he says oh we must be at the end time so he preached the church aid series at the end of the church age series the angel says now we read malachi 4. and he realized that's me and then he was willing to step into that office but it wasn't until 63. he says when the angel when the messenger begins to sound he says the messenger wasn't sounding when i was a baptist preacher the messenger wasn't sounding when i did the zerman or or the other thing he said that wasn't it he said when god put the sword in my hand he says that's when that's when the message began that's when i began and he says now i have a message i have to deliver to the people and i cannot turn back from that so in his life he had to slowly go from this office to this office to this office you were called as christians but you're also called to be the bride of jesus christ you were born a human being but now you're called to be sons and daughters of god it takes a huge change in our thinking oh yeah i'm just a sinner saved by grace in fact that that's what bothered me when i was in the bath in in the denominational system oh yeah you're a sinner saved by grace the emphasis was on i was a sinner i was always going to be a sinner i was always going to have mistakes i was always going to have problems always going to trying to overcome but in this message i find it no i'm a son of god that's been fully restored to my rightful position with god but still it takes a huge chance for information in my thinking do i am i acting as a sinners i by grace or now am i able to act as a son of god am i able to actually get into the channel where god can speak through me and do the things through me that he's wanting to do because see that's what we are called to be we are at the end time the end time is no longer future we are there but see we have to begin we have to step into the office of of being the bride of jesus christ we have to step into the office of being sons and daughters of god we have to be able to sit there and begin to realize this is what i am the bible says now are you the sons of god does not appear what you shall be but but when you shall see him you should just be him like he is that's now but you have to believe it [Applause] you have to believe this that's why god sent the prophet that one one minister i think anyway they they made mention of the fact you know during the church ages he was dealing with both vines when he gets to the to the last church age the lady is seeing church age no he was just dealing with a false one it took a prophet to this generation to tell the bride no you are not lukewarm no you are not reaching increasingly no what you are you are the son of god you are the pure pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ you are sinless in his sight and sometimes i wrestle with that one even but it has to it comes to the place in our thinking we have to be willing to step into that we have to be willing to get out of ourselves and quit relying upon ages and could relying upon our own thoughts and our own processes and our own intellect if you will and begin to come to come to grips with the fact no we are sons and daughters of god we have the authority of god because of who we represent one of the things when you look at the ones when they when they came into into the land of canaan before they were there when they were in the wilderness there's there's a i think it's a psalm 78 or something like that the question was well god did this but can he do this well god did this but i wonder if he can do this and they you know it but it was always can god they didn't believe it until god until god performed it but if they would turn that around like when when the spies went into the land ten of them came back says oh yeah we're grasshoppers in their sight we're just little puny things we can't there's no way we can do that because they left god out of the picture but the other two this is no god has given to us a promise and because of that promise he has given us the land it doesn't matter what we look like we could hobble in there you know with wooden legs and and and wooden broomsticks like that and we could slaughter all of them i mean with shamgar he just took an ox goat and he killed 600 philistines he had samson he just took a draw bone of an i don't know how many thousands he killed but i mean here again use what you have and what you have you have the word god is still god god did not die in 63. god did not god did not die when when the prophet was taken off the scene no god is alive today and he'll do the same thing but you have to believe it is all based upon your ability to believe revelations 10 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto unto unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said to him give me the little book he said let me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in their mouth sweet as honey in other words you have to become with one with that word you have to sow feed on that word until really the word consumes you until you and the you you basically you and the word literally unite together and becomes the same and i went into the angel and said give me the little book and he said to eat it and he says i took a little book in the angel's hand and it was it was my mouth the sweetest honey and stuff he said but thou must prophesy it's not brother branham will prophesy this is revelations 10 10 11. brother branham was in revelations 10 7. no this is the bride's ministry it isn't it isn't relegated to the prophet no now it has come from the prophet down unto us and this is where we where where we need to become brother brown and wisdom versus faith he says jesus noted by experience he noted by revelation he know that he was that son of god that was to come into the world he knowed his standing he knowed he was born in the world for that purpose and that's the reason the word of god could work through him because he knowed what he was glory he said have you caught that yet that was in 62. have you caught the fact this is who you are jesus knew who he was do you know who you are because now we have to be willing to step into that office we have to be willing to step into that position and if we can ever step into the position and have the relationship with god that we should be having all of a sudden we can rest in him and then it doesn't matter wherever he guides us or directs us or whatever the circumstances might be because it's no longer relying upon us it's relying upon him it's all about him anyway it's not about us [Music] church on its condition brother banner makes this statement he said there you are the dove and the lamb united together that's when god and man became one that's when heaven and earth embrace each other he said that's when god was made flesh that's when god came down from the spirit form and was made amen and dwelt among us that's when all eternity embraced each other that's when the human race humans fallen race of adam's people and jehovah god and every angel come together when god and man was made one on that great memorial day when john baptized jesus you say you receive the holy spirit so what do you receive third person of a trinity or is it the same god that dwelt in christ now dwells in you the same god that dwelts in peter and paul and james and john the same one that dwelt in brother branham did you receive that god because if you did he will do through you the same thing he did through them there's no difference there is no difference but you have to believe you have to get out of your thinking and be able to embrace the fact of who you are and what you are so you can enter into this rest with god where you can come to the place where you so trust in him and you have so much faith in him that whatever you say you find in the word that's when all of us that's that's when you can believe this stuff remember in flesh he was just a man but in spirit he was god but a man in flesh therefore his body was a human being that was subject to temptation subject to sickness just the same as as ours he had to put he had to put on because he was a man he was human and then he was god in the spirit he says i and my father are one my father do with it and see this is where we have to come in our lives it isn't up to you to heal anybody it's up to you to pray we are a king we are we are a kingdom of priests we are kings and priests unto god kings rule what do we rule over satan's kingdom you have the authority to tell them to back off you have to tell them to take a hike you ever tell them to have a headache you have a television i don't want what you're trying to give me you enjoy it for the next couple three days i don't want that what you're trying to give me but see you have that you have that authority but you we failed to use it it says whosoever believeth in me shall never die believe believeth in me not on me but in me being in him believing if you abide in me in my words and you see in him believing ye and me and i knew that they might be one father even as you and i are one god in christ christ in the church see just as as we are one so they be one then how can you be one if you abide in me and my words and you see it's abiding my words in you and then ask what you will and if it isn't you no more it's the word that's in you it's the word of god it's about him it's not about us it's not what you do it's what he does it's what you allow him to do through you because often we say well i'm i don't know if i can do that i don't i don't feel good today i'm i'm just kind of a little awake brother branham says when the weakest of saints balance their leaves before god satan trembles because there all of a sudden that little weakling is getting in touch with what has more power than anything that you could even begin to imagine otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride see all right i'll go with you and you will be a part of me you will be my bride my life will be in your body just like a husband and wife with one person you and i are going to be one at that day you'll know that i am in the father the fathers and me i and you and you and me oh i just love that satan gets so angry there see the oneness of god [Applause] all that god was he poured into christ all the christ was he poured into the church there you are it makes us all one in that sense we are part of the godhead you are a part of god from the beginning you have been fully restored to your rightful position with god and you have to embrace this i mean this is what i see around me this i hear these people pray and then pray like well you know god is out there someplace and god won't hear my prayers and and i'm not sure i have the faith to believe that god will do that yes you do god does not see you as a sinner god sees you as righteous as he is righteous so quit looking at yourself quit looking at your stumbling and your faults and your failures i have plenty of them every time i get out of bed in the morning i make a lot of them but it's not about me it's about him i just confess it to him and he puts it in the receivers of his forgetfulness and that's the end of it but see this is where we have to come in our relationship i get i i have come to the place in my life i rest i've actually come to the place of my life i rest does everything go well no i get up and i have certain things planned for the day and all of a sudden something happens and changes the whole day um i don't i don't control the future um that's that's not my place i mean there was times we were i think we were in arkansas and it was a tornado coming around and we looked at it and says well lord can you have it go around us he did he split it in two went around us and joined back together again and continued on its journey that's no problem we were in jamaica once and all of a sudden it was going to come right through where we were at i said well lord can you just veer it just a little bit to the north that's what it did all of a sudden story doing this curve it just okay well that's fine you'll see that's impossible no it's not jesus could say peace be still the wind's in the ways obeyed him brother ramses in the storm you stop and you go back and let the sun shine out for three or four days they were done hunting and that's exactly what happened that spoken word lies in you but you have to be i don't like driving through big cities every now and then i have to go through atlanta if i had the spoken word most of the people in lancer driving would be off of the road i would speak them out of existence so i could nicely go on my way but see that's not using it rightfully that that is not god's will but but you but but but other things come like the hurricanes and the tornadoes and stuff well lord you've given us the authority we just want to go around us we you know if you want to just get rid of it that's fine too but if you don't just have it go around us and that's what it did but see we have that authority that arrives within us and if we get in touch with our heavenly father and we can rest in him and we can trust in him and have the faith to believe that whatever we speak that's exactly what's going to happen god will honor that because he said he would this is what god was trying to tell us through the prophet it isn't the prophet could say this the prophet could say that and the prophet could see this vision and prophecy can do that no it's not about the prophet it was about god there was one thing i read i wish i could think of it right now but he said it's i think it's in zechariah or something like that in the first thing he said where he said go back and look and look at the words that the prophets have given where are the prophets they're all gone where's your fathers they're all gone but what happened to the word i gave through them that is what has been fulfilled well brother branham is not here but the word that he has given unto us that word is still here and what do we do we read that word we study that word we pray about that word and we try and take that word until it becomes a part of us and when that word becomes a part of us then all of a sudden that becomes god speaking through us when all of a sudden god takes control of our minds you know in our mouth and all of a sudden we open it up and he speaks to us because that's what god's trying to do now this is where we're at and in jesus christ the same he says you keep trying to trying to test your faith i wonder if i've got faith enough to do this have i got faith he said don't test your faith god said so do it anyway god said sue after you have tested your faith whether you had enough faith to come to the meeting or did you have enough faith to come to the meeting tonight did you test your faith to see if you had enough faith to eat your supper tonight you uh do do you think you'll have you'll have to fast well while it tests what to test your faith he said no he says he says he says this is this is all wrong it's not a matter of testing it's a matter of coming to a relationship with god where you rest brother brown says god was revealed in christ now how many believes that god was revealed in christ jehovah revealed in christ nowhere is god to be revealed in his church with his people in us the same spirit the same works the same manifestations the same love the same forgiveness the same long suffering gentleness patience peace mercy it wasn't about power it was about character it wasn't the power that you say oh man look at what i can do you can't do anything if god doesn't want doesn't honor your prayer you can't do nothing but yet if you have the character of christ and you have the relationship which god is trying to establish with you then all of a sudden he can come down and he can work through you and he can do things that you would never even have have thought about remember keep this in mind all that god was departing into christ and he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all that christ was he's poured into the church god above us god with us now it's god it is the triunity of god so what about the predestined bride of jesus christ now do you believe the bride is predestinated amen they say the predestinated bride of christ christ now now the church the word the predestined right of christ now the church the word seed with everything that god promised to put into the church is in it right now that was in 62. god rich in mercy he says i'm only saying this not to not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and the scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of god see you always were sons of god for when god had when god had you in his thinking in the beginning uh you you have to be of this some part of you had to be in there your life that's in you now had to be with god before well then then he before even before the material was not on earth he says in one place he knew the color of your scare he knew how fat i would be he knew that i would be going bald he knew i would be curly hair in my beard he knew he knew where i would live he knew everything about me and he loved me anyway do you realize that he knew you were a scoundrel he knew you were a renegade he knew everything that you have done from the time you were a child to the time you came to christ and he knows what you'll be tomorrow and he still loves you because you are his child jesus when he died on the cross at calvary he took care of all of your sins past present and future not so you can sin that's not the point but so that you can confess it and put it under the blood so you can re-establish the relationship you have with your with your father i know with i know i was in really trouble when all of a sudden my mom looked at me and said wait till your daddy gets home i had them did all of her books out of her bookcase yeah that was the wrong button to push so daddy came home and i made sure he had his slippers i made sure he had his paper i made sure he had a glass of water which is out of character for me and so he looked at me and he says have you been behaving today oh yeah daddy i was really really good today let me go talk to your mommy so then i had to go out and get a willow switch and i had to make sure it was just the right so it would have been just nice and dad used it on my bottom so i stood up for dinner that night but hell was still his son he still loved me in spite of everything i had done that day he still loved me i will always be his son well i have a heavenly father he knows the mistakes i make he knows i'm not perfect in myself my perfection's in him my righteousness is him everything i need is him branham one inflation talks about the fire when moses met the bush he said the fire left the bush and got inside moses okay so where's the fire now it's in us we have up here on this the psalm of gil the bomb of gilead this is a summation of everything i've been trying by the grace of god to present the one thing we have to up to now is supreme faith to what we have had something that he says now you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you're doing when you understand like like he says you walk you just say well i'm going to go home i'm going to go out and start the car he says that's all an act of faith tomorrow i will meet you at a certain place that's all an act of faith because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you well that's the way the things of god are a regular routine with you you get sick he heals you you establish a relationship you have a need he supplies the need you establish the relationship it goes on in your life as i mean when i was first accepted jesus christ as my savior i mean how many years ago it's been now but over all of those years he's been teaching me to the place where i have learned over and over to begin to trust him i've seen him god healed my wife numerous occasions i've seen him heal me numerous times i've seen him take care of us when we were in india there's a couple times in india if god hadn't intervened we wouldn't be here but god intervened god's watched over us god took care of us and when i it's interesting when i am in in india i know i have no control so i trust in him now when i come home i think i have control no no no i think i do okay and sometimes i act like i think i do and then circumstances change but see it's this relationship it's the way that you live with him every single day you get up in the morning and says god thank you for another day of life god what do you want me to do today god i have to go to work today watch over me make sure nothing no harm comes to me while i'm at work watch me on the road as i'm traveling lord my we're family we're in need of groceries my family were in need of this my family were in need of that and then lo and behold he turns around and he supplies it because you're his child and so and so brother brown says see that's a faith you're going to go out and start your car why you you go out there you stick the key and you turn that ah it starts it's always started right unless you have a dead battery but i mean generally speaking it always does you go you go into the house and and you know it's dark you do you reach for the light switch you flip it on light comes on okay why it's it's supreme faith because it always happens and so what happens with god now you're walking with god and says well god i have this need and all of a sudden he supplies it that's supreme faith because you're willing to trust him you're willing to get out of yourself you're instead of running back into egypt instead of running back to you and relying upon yourself what are you doing now you're putting it in his hands and says god you take care of me god you supply my knees today and you watch him do it every single day and then you realize god you're still there god's just alive you're the same yesterday today and forever and you just walk with him and then something comes up well okay lord you knew this was going to happen okay you take care of it it's that simple but you have to be willing to get away from yourself you have to be willing to take it and put it in his hand he said this is the supreme faith that we must have see after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just a regular routine it becomes a way of life with you where really you put your hands in his and says god you must take my hand today because i can't see where the future goes god you have to take my hand today because things have come up and all of us i don't know what to do lord so you have to lead me and you have to guide me you have to take care of me and and and you will do that and you'll find he's more than willing to do that it's when you get like the other one in havoc of well i can do this myself and god says fine you go ahead and do it i'll just stand back and laugh you know it just becomes a way of life and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way just a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plan of god and we're there we're there this is where we have to come this is what god's been trying to drum into my head for the last two years this is where i have to come in my relationship with him i have to come to the place where i've watched him every single day over and over and over again situations arise i had no control over and okay lord what do you want us to do now lord i'm trusting you because i don't have the answer for this and then he does he takes care of it and he said this is where it has to come just before the rapture we the bride must come to the place where we totally rest and trust in our god amen brother chad i just want to say praise god i was greatly edified by the word tonight and there was such a good reminder of where we're supposed to be living amen oh i thank god for that reminder you know i was thinking the whole time that he was talking i kept thinking about the relationship between husband and wife and how the wife just trusts that a husband's going to take care of her and christ is our husband and i don't think it's very i don't think it shows much faith and appreciation for him if we're constantly worried whether or not christ will take care of us i just want to be able to say he promised me and i trusted him and the wife becomes the reflection of the husband and our faith in him and our rest becomes a reflection of what a wonderful husband he is and i praise god i want to show what a wonderful husband he is not by wringing my hands and being nervous and being fearful every time something happens but i want to have such a confidence in him that i can reflect him because i trust him so much to take care of it and i know he's going to do something special i was thinking of sister marcia and her testimony she came down sunday for prayer and she prayed because she had these test results to read and and she had heard something that they were concerned about before and she didn't want to hear any bad news and after we prayed you remember what i told you sister marsha i said look forward to going and hearing the results look forward to going and hearing the results and praise god she got good results amen i think that's the approach we need to have all the time i'm looking forward to see what he'll do boy this is a bad situation this is terrible i can't wait to see what he does this time this is impossible it can't be fixed boy i can't wait to see what he'll do this time i want to live there amen i've not lived there like i want to but i want to live there praise god god bless you brother and always good to have you i appreciate the word amen remember to keep praying for brother nolan sister shirley as they keep doing the work that god's called them to do it's sure nice to have you guys here amen you got a song brother ben let's just sing it's not in trying [Music] it's not in one dream but in pray that we find the strength of the lord it's not entirely [Music] it's not in one [Music] [Music] it's not in [Music] the word of prayer but as we do i want you to think is there something in your life do you have a a need in your body do you have a need right now that after you've heard the preaching of the word that god has dealt with that need a physical need a financial need an emotion whatever the need is how many are going to be from this point on say i'm going to trust god for that i'm going to believe and speak that he will take care of this issue now my faith is in courage is to reach out and take the word let's take that to prayer and take that need to prayer right now dear lord jesus we thank you god for using our brother to remind us of the position we're supposed to be in where you've placed us by your grace what you've told us how you explained it to us so thoroughly by the prophet lord that we need to be living lord in a in a realm where we trust you for everything god forgive us lord for for fear forgive us lord for our lack of trust but god you're encouraging us to believe you and there's something inside of us rising to the occasion god we all have needs we've raised hands all over the building saying there's something in my body there's something in my mind there's a need in my life or in my family that i am trusting you for from this moment forward i'm not going to fix it i'm going to watch you fix it lord give us inspiration lord give us leadership lord move us in the direction we should go provide for us supernaturally however we'll do it we're not dictating how you'll do it but you'll do it according to the promise that's in your word you will deliver us you will heal us lord you will provide for us we're believing for it now as your children we're receiving it in the name of jesus christ god i pray many testimonies will come from the faith that comes forth from hearing your word trusting in you reestablishing the firmness by that relationship how solid that it is how much you've proved yourself trustworthy in our lives may we learn to fully rely on you god may you show yourself mighty on our behalf for god we will sing of your glory we will testify of your goodness we will tell others of what you've done for us for you are amazing lord god i pray that you'd bless us as we go from here may we go rejoicing in what we've heard may we go rejoicing in the reality that we're walking in in this day the life that you've called us to lord may it be a joy for us to walk through this world lord we know that this world is once again falling apart but god your bride's not falling apart we know that these things that put pressure on us they cause disruptions in our lives just like everybody else's but lord we don't have to react the way the rest of the world reacts we don't have to respond the way the rest of the world responds but you're calling for a different response from us you're calling for us to be a people who fully trust in you that you might have preeminence in us god i pray lord as we walk through this life when others are mourning may we be rejoicing when others are weeping may we be singing lord because we have a heavenly father who watches over us we have a husband who's promised to take care of us god you've called us to be a special people by your grace god let us believe it lord and receive it the way you've given it to us meet these needs and let us go rejoicing father we love you we trust in you we thank you we pray a special blessing on brother nolan sister surely lord as you use our brother to minister the word wherever you take him and especially the influence he has in india lord i
