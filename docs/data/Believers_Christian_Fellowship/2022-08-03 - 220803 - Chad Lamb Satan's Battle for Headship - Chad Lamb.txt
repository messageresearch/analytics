[Music] genesis 3 and 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you should not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and god bless you as you're seated and may lord bless us as we look into his word for a subject tonight i'd like to take a title satan's battle for headship satan's battle for headship and uh i was really stimulated by the service on sunday i was really blessed by the ministry that came through our brother kyle and it really edified me and while i was sitting there god was giving me some inspiration and i just jotted it down on a piece of paper and i slipped it in my bible and i thought i'll get to that down the road you know because i've been studying on another subject and and i've been wanting to get into this other subject amen but i just could not get away from that inspiration it kept coming back and back so i took that that paper out and started looking at that and the lord just began to bless us in a certain direction amen so so this was an inspiration that struck me during the service on sunday but as we look uh like i said the many times we preach there's nothing new but god is constantly giving us a clear vision amen constantly opening his word for us and we see here in the beginning that eve had the word and she was to keep the word and it was a simple commandment that she was to keep but that word was her protection and nothing could touch her she could not be defiled she could not fall nothing could happen to her as long as she stayed behind this word it wasn't complex it wasn't it wasn't complicated uh it was simple straightforward and if she would have stayed with them and when she stayed with the word the word were taking the preeminence in their lives and the word was taking headship the word was protecting the word was doing all of these things for them the word was doing it because the word is god so god was protecting them god was watching over him god was taking preeminence god was having headship he was having it as they obeyed his word amen so satan came and he had to get her out from under the word amen and he gave her another word and when she when she moved into another word amen she took another husband she took another headship amen because now this was a perverted word and she received the perverted word amen and it was the satan was trying to get dominion he was trying to get the headship he was trying to get preeminence so that he could work his plan god wants preeminence so god can work his plan satan wants preeminence so he can work his own plan amen so just to lay a foundation i want to read a couple quotes here in 1961 revelation chapter 4 part 2. now the first throne was in heaven judgment seat the second throne was in christ the third throne is in man amen now we'll skip a paragraph come down one more now what is a man he's a triune being body soul and spirit how many knows that watch god's approach what is his heart you remember my message god chose a man's heart for his control tower the devil chose his head for his control tower see he makes him see things look through his eyes but god in his heart makes him believe things that he cannot see did he see god in his heart in the heart of man is the throne of god you get it man god made his throne in the heart of man now he says now satan tries to get him to see things but god gets them to believe things he can't see so god told them to stay away from this tree but satan told them that it wasn't exactly what god had said that there was some misunderstanding amen and when when god when satan began to entice the woman then she began to look at the tree and consider the tree and then she began to use her senses she began to look at the tree to see it was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes desire want bull to make one wise she began to move into the realm of mental to reasoning and thought and and she was entertaining this idea amen because the devil chose to use the mind god chose to set up his control tower in the heart where somebody believes by faith without reasonings amen without then without all the details without all the explanation just because it's the word of god we stay behind the word of god and that word of god is the headship is the protection is the wall but the satan's trying to take dominion using his headquarters in the mind and get get us to switch over from simple faith in the word to reasoning and intellect and pondering and wondering and all of these other things amen so that we can move into the realm of reasoning and thought amen and thereby be deceived by the senses amen now we go down to the greatest battle ever fought in 1962 it says now before any battle can be put in a ray they first have to choose a meeting ground or a place where the battle is to be fought a selected place in the first world war it was so placed a no man's land a place where they fought and they've got to be a place selected like when israel went to war with the philistines there was a hill on each side where they gathered and that's where goliath came out and called to the armies of israel that's where david met him in the valley when he passed over the little creek that run between the two hills he picked up the rocks there has to be a place selected and in this there's a mutual ground no man's land they fight here at this place they just don't one fight over here and one down here and one run over here there's a battlefront where they meet and test their powers where each army tested strength against the other army a mutual meeting place now don't miss this when this great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that battlegrounds begin in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of battle there is where it began and that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head now they never started it from some organ in the organization they never started from some mechanical affair the grounds never started there therefore that organization can never never do the work of god because the battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you so we know that god set up his control tower in the soul the devil set up his control tower and the mind he's using senses and reasoning and thought memory reasoning affections and see taste smell feel and here's using all of these things amen to try to take the headship amen god is wanting headship by his word amen and he's got his he's got his control tower in the heart but the decisions are made in the mind because we've we've been put on free moral agency we've come to the opportunity to make our choice amen even lucifer was given an opportunity to make his choice and he made his choice amen to backslide amen to exert his will over the will of god amen we've got to make our choice and the choice is made in the mind but the devil is using the mind as the control tower amen but god is working in the soul by faith amen so we make our choice not when we reason everything out and one has a better explanation than the other amen because that's where the devil's working but we make our choice when we go a little deeper than the level of reasoning and thought when something in the heart strikes unto the word and says that's nothing but the truth that's thus saith the lord that's the word i'm taking the word that's the choice you make in your mind but it comes from faith in the heart right so just because the battlegrounds in the mind doesn't mean that god is just working in the mind and sane's working in the mind god's headquarters is deeper than the mind it's in the soul and he's operating by faith so the devil can make something so enticing so reasonable so thought provoking so we can i mean we can come to battle thought for thought scripture for scripture quote for quote but if we're ever going to have victory there's got to be a source that goes deeper than the thought realm deeper than the mind there's got to be something in the soul that can get a hold of the word of god and say that's the truth i'm going with the word even though i can't explain it to the devil you know eve there's no way eve would have been able to rationally explain to the devil why she couldn't eat from this tree all right she there's no way the the he began to question the word of god and question it to her and then and get her to amend doubt amen the word of god and doubt even her understanding of the word of god and begin to try to show her another way to interpret the word or another way amen in the word amen and she could never have rationalized why god said don't eat from this she couldn't have pointed to facts she couldn't have went to a case study she couldn't went to historical information so there was no decision based on facts she would simply have to believe that if god said it it's right if god said it it's the right way to go i'm choosing god's way in the realm of my mind because of something in my heart and i'm rejecting the enticing speech of satan even though i can't combat it with more facts amen praise be to god i don't want to stay on that too long i'm going to keep moving all right let's go to first samuel this is where things started coming alive for me when uh brother kyle went to the story of david and goliath and god just started triggering some things let's look at first samuel 17. first samuel 17 43 and the philistines said unto david am i a dog and thou comes to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods and the philistines said to david come to me and i will i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field and then and then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied. this day will the lord deliver thee unto my hand and i will smite thee and take nine head from thee and i will give thy carcass of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and the wild beasts of the earth and all the earth may know that there is a god in israel and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you unto our hands now when we look at the situation that david was up against it was unreasonable to believe that david could defeat goliath it was not logical it was not reasonable your eyesight would never have brought you to that conclusion your reasoning would have never brought you to that conclusion amen there's no reasonable explanation for david's courage there's no reasonable explanation for david's faith there's no way that david could explain amen how he's going to defeat goliath and how he's going to cut off his head he just knows that he's going to defeat david goliath and he's going to cut off his head how i don't know that he knew amen he didn't he didn't give the details he couldn't have thoroughly explained it all but he knew it was going to happen and he could declare that it was going to happen because he knew that this was an uncircumcised philistine who was not even in the promise but david was circumcised and anointed amen and was standing upon the word of god this was an enemy encroaching into the kingdom of god into the word of god defying the armies of god and there was no way that this could stand so it wasn't reasoning david was relying on nor his eyesight nor any other natural faculty amen there was a seat of faith in there that was rising up under the occasion because he was anointed in such a way amen to take on this thing and he was going after it amen by faith all right so now the rest of israel was stuck in a head battle with sight with sound they saw the giant and listen he was he was a giant i mean he was a giant of a giant he was a big man and he would come down across i'm off that other side of that mountain and down to the edge of the valley to call out to them and this was psychological warfare amen he would come down and he would have an armor bearer come with him and i'll just tell you how the devil works i would guess i don't know but i would guess they picked the smallest man that they could find in the philistine army to be the armor bearer for goliath so from across the valley and the ratio this is how the devil does it he was a giant he was an absolute giant amen but across the way if they would have picked the smallest guy they would a guy got a guy who was four foot eleven five foot one to carry his armor amen to where he could barely tumble along with the shield amen the israelites from across the valley would be like whoa and nothing in their mind let them believe they could defeat that but david wasn't looking at his size the only thing he heard when when that philistine boasted was a challenge against the word of god everybody else saw a challenge against their person and they saw themselves versus goliath david saw god versus goliath this is why it's good to know who you are and whose side you're on and who's in you amen to know that you're a child of god standing for the word of god if you don't have that settled you'll never win a battle because you're looking at yourself versus this devil you're looking yourself versus this sickness yourself versus this situation amen but when you realize that something contrary to the word is coming and challenging the word in your life challenging whether this word is true or not challenging whether or not he's the same yesterday today forever challenging whether or not he already paid for healing when he died on calvary challenging whether or not bias stripes you're already healed when you think it's you amen fighting against this challenge amen you'll do the same thing the israelites do hide out in the tent and hope it goes away but if we can go like david and say i have been i'm an i am a part of the circumcision i'm part of israel i'm part of the chosen i have a seal of god in my life and furthermore i've been anointed for this day amen because the anointing is on the bride to overcome in this day so i've been anointed to the word i mean i've been anointed to defy the armies of the enemy and when something comes in i don't have to run and hide and hope it goes away all i need to do is say amen the god who's delivered me from this and deliver me from that and deliver me from this will deliver me from this also because it's nothing more than a challenge against the word of god and i'm here representing the word of god i am a representative of the very manifested word of god and this philistine this demon is challenging the word of god not challenging me as a person david as a person was no match for goliath as a person and you as a human being are no match for a devil these devils have been around amen for thousands and thousands of years amen their chief captain is perfect in wisdom they have been deceiving mankind for thousands of years you and your intellect are zero match for a devil that's why you can't look at yourself and fight an enemy you can't you can't take the devil's challenge and withstand him when you look at yourself you have to see that this devil is attacking the word of god that's supposed to be manifesting in my flesh because god wants his word on display and he wants it on display in his body and you have to know where that body is who that body is and know that you're a member of that body and if you know that you're a member of that body now it's not you fighting the devil amen it's the word of god through you fighting that devil amen stay here in first samuel 17 but i want to read two other passages of scripture i'm going to read to you out of psalms 83. sorry in verse 1 says keep not thou silent o god hold not thy peace and be not still god for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up the head this is so important they that hate thee have lifted up their head lucifer in the beginning was trying to exalt himself over the stars of god and be like the most high he was lifting himself up and and and the same thing goliath was doing he was elevated in stature but in his speech he was lifting himself up and defying the living god and defying the armies of god so the enemy is always lifted lifting up the head man that's important to understand because lifting up the head doesn't just mean that he was taller but lifting up the head brings the reasoning the thought amen when when satan threw the serpent was enticing eve he was lifting up his head over her head and he was giving her more knowledge than she had and he was lifting his head above her head amen so she should not have relied on her own head she should have went to the true headship of the word because the true headship of the word is always over that head so the enemy is always lifting up his head against god trying to out reason out think outmaneuver out speak out [Applause] all right so though that haiti have lifted up the head they have taken crafty counseled against thy people and consulted against the hidden ones who are the hidden ones by faith i believe i'm one of those hidden ones and he's lifted up his head against god taking crafty counsel against thy people and and consulted against the hidden ones then jesus says in matthew 23 10 it says neither be you called masters for one is your master even christ but he that is graced among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted so these are principles with god that we should never deviate from because anything that lifts its head above the word of god is a devil anything that will lift its head against this message and try to overthink or over rationalize the messenger of the age is an enemy to god amen anything that will exalt itself will be abased but those that will humble themselves to the word of god in this day shall be exalted so the reality is you can never exalt yourself so if you want to be higher and you want to live in a higher realm and you want to climb into the higher heights you can never do it yourself the only way you can do it is if somebody exalts you because anything that exalts self is of lucifer's nature amen because christ came from high to low abased himself and became servant of all amen and god exalted him so he humbled himself god exalted him that's the pattern lucifer had a high position but was not satisfied with his position wanted to go a little higher that's always characteristic of the enemy but god was always able to go from a high position to a low position to serve others then he was exalted to a high position so david was anointed to be king and after he was anointed be king he went to the field to serve his father and keep his father sheep right the so there's no problem staying humble amen when god's in it because god's the one will exalt in due time all right so the enemy lifts its head i don't want you to think of physical head but that thinking that reasoning that intellectual side trying to out reason amen the message of the day or find reasons why brother graham taught a certain subject the wrong way or may not have been right on that amen that's absolute the enemy but those who are able to humble themselves in due time shall be exalted now let's go on to uh back to first samuel 17. i'm going to look at verse 50. so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone i want you to think about this what is reasonable about this nothing when you see david with a staff a shepherd's bag shepherd's clothes sandals amen five rocks and a piece of leather and a staff running down one hillside to meet a giant who has an armor bearer amen because his armor is so heavy he has somebody carry it for him until he's ready for battle with a giant spear with a giant shield amen with a helmet of brass all the armament and he's gigantic and he's a warrior from his youth david's as far as we know never fought another human being there's nothing in the scenario that's intellectual that's reasonable that makes sense your eyesight your ears amen nothing will tell you amen that this is a fair fight and i'll go to tell you it's not a fair fight god's on david's side so it's not at all a fair fight i mean i can imagine so many years we're watching david say oh poor david amen and david was thinking oh poor giant i mean if god's on your side you're more than a match amen so let's look at verse 50. so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david david already prophesied he'd he'd cut off his head and he didn't have a sword see david's not relying on his intellect his reasoning what he can see he's not relying on the sword that he can feel that he can see he doesn't have it calculated he can't see the next step but he knows what he's supposed to do there was no sword in the hand of david therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took a sword and drew it out of the sheet thereof and slew him and cut off his head there with and when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled amen so so david prevailed with a sling and with a stone now i want to i want to look at this because we're talking about the head exalted over the enemies so when it comes to goliath's head he was so much higher than david so if we look at this and it this is a physical match-up that we're looking at there's a physical offset we have a short boy amen with no armament and no skill and then we have a giant who's much bigger with all the armament and and so when we look at this different situation i want you to think in the realms of reasoning understand and intellect all right the devil has got you beat in reasoning he's far above you in intellectual prowess and scientific understanding all right and so goliath is all the way up here david's down here and so his head is lifted up above his enemy amen and he thinks he knows something and he's got it all figured out and over his head to protect that wrong thinking he's got armament of brass all over his head so his thinking he is he has armored his thinking to where nothing can penetrate his reasoning he's got it so reasoned out he's got it so well thought out his plan is so planned out amen that he's got it wrapped around in brass amen but david all he needs is one revelation that comes from faith amen in one revelation that come from faith in the word of god amen was able and he took that sling and he slung that stone and brother branham said that god guided the stone home there was only one empty place that wasn't armored and god knew where that was and that stone of revelation because stone means a revelation amen and i don't think it was a big stone because it had to get through a little hole but it took a simple revelation in the word of god amen and god empowered that revelation and drove it home in the head of the giant amen where the reasoning and the thinking is amen and if we want to defeat the giants in our life we have to stop going around trying to get help we got to stop trying on saul's armor we have to stop convincing everybody to go with us we need to take faith in the word of god and take one little word amen one jesus went to calvary into the to the grave with one promise with one scripture with one revelation on the word of god and overcame and conquered death we have to stop trying to get everybody to help us and everybody stand with us all of israel had failed what we need is to have faith in this word that's been given to us and have a real revelation by faith in the word that has been placed in our hands and have enough courage to let loose of one of those revelations and let god drive it home amen i mean we don't have to sit here and hone our skills until you know i can i can lace a revelation right through the baptist and the presbyterian doctrine and get it hit home amen that's not the point the point is to have faith to let it go then let god take over because it's his word amen and it drove home into the giant source of thinking to the head and he collapsed under that and then david goes and stands up on the philistine and takes the philistine sword and cuts his own head off all right this is so the bible is so perfect in its types and shadows that he severed that reasoning that thinking and not speaking [Music] off of the giant and when the nation of israel saw that they they come running out and they smote the philistines i think it's so interesting what david said david said today i will smite thee and i will give the carcasses of the philistines to the fowls and the beasts amen this prophecy goes all the way through to the book of revelations to chapter 19. and in chapter 19 there's a white horse rider who is jesus christ amen and his name is in his name is called the word of god amen coming on a white horse with the armies of heaven following him and he's coming down amen and he's called lord of lord and king of kings and out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword amen and it says in revelation 19 that will smite the nations amen and here he comes and brother branham says he will slay them by the word so how's he going to kill them by the word by the word that's coming out of his mouth amen by the revelation of the word and when he when he takes and he takes captive the dragon and the beast and the false prophet amen then he smites the the remnant amen of them with the with the sword out of his mouth which is by the word amen there is no battle of armageddon where jesus is riding around on a physical horse swinging his head to and fro chopping people's heads off he slays them by the word that comes out of his mouth they are slayed by the word and besides these aren't people with armies and tanks brother branham said they're catholics and protestants they're denominational systems and in this day we've seen the lord amen smite those denominational systems by the word that come out of his mouth and then he said he called an angel standing in the sun called for the fowls of the air to come feast upon their flesh and when brother bam describes this amen in the seals he says now look back on the sixth seal amen he destroys her with death and he destroys her with beasts of the field here they come the fowls and the beasts of the field come to eat their flesh amen who did it first who prophesied at first it was david all the way back amen david amen slew the giant amen that was defying the armies of god and when he slew the giant the nation went out and fought what did he use he used a stone then he took his head off he destroyed that thinking that reasoning and then he fed the carcasses of the philistines to the thousand beasts of the air because the son of david is going to do the same thing in this day praise be to god the bible is perfect in every way in 1961 abraham's covenant confirmed brother bram says as i said the other night in the garden of eden the devil chose a part of man and god chose a part of man god chose his heart the devil chose his intellects and now today the church today depends everything upon intellect and never thinking of the heart and the only thing they can say well i just can't see it that way you don't see with your eyes anyhow you look with your eyes you see with your heart you look at anything i just don't see it you're looking at it but you don't see it it means you don't understand it your understanding comes from your heart from faith by revelation now here he is now he doesn't understand it with his mind how he's going to do it his intellectuals would tell him that that's his reasoning but the bible said we cast down reasonings cast them away from us praise god let's go to second corinthians chapter 10. second corinthians chapter 10. in second corinthians chapter 10 we'll begin reading in verse 3. for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh this is not a flesh war no matter what you're going through it's not the flesh it may look every which way around you like it's flesh the situation at work the situation a home situation with a whatever with finances with a car with a relationship it may look like fast it's not flesh remember then because the scripture says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having in readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled i want to take a minute and talk about this casting down imaginations that takes place in the mind amen in every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god that comes from his word and bringing every and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ which is the anointed word this battle takes place in the mind everything in this scripture refers to the mental realm but the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but we bring everything into obedience to christ the anointed word every imagination is cast down and that cast down is not just dropped i mean it's a violent term meaning to pull down or to to destroy casting down imaginations in the thought every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god that comes from the word that's in your mind amen and bringing into captivity every thought into the obedience of christ amen which is the anointed word for your day so what do we battle and what do we battle with amen we're battling in the mental realm but we're always bringing every thought rejecting thoughts and bringing thoughts in obedience to the manifested word for our day this is how we're taught to warfare amen not by more reasoning not by more intellects not by more thinking but we're supposed to take the simple word of god and say that thought doesn't match what the prophet taught that thought doesn't match what paul brought that thought doesn't matter that desire is contrary to the word that thought is contrary to the word amen that teaching is contrary to the word to christ christ is the anointed word that's our word to warfare amen not fleshly but we're the warfare in the spirit but how do we warn the spirit not thought against thought thought against word amen not imagination against imagination imagination against the word we bring everything we cast it down because it doesn't match the word we bring the thought subject amen we capture it and bring it in obedience to christ we do not allow these thoughts to roam around that are contrary to the word why because like brother kyle was saying on sunday it starts in the mind the battle is worn or lost in the mind the fight according to paul takes place in the mind amen but you've got to have a revelation of the word because you've got to know what word you believe praise be to god and you've got to have enough faith in the word to speak the word contrary to the thought amen let's go to judges chapter 9. back to judges back before samuel we were just reading judges chapter 9 i want to stay on this subject i've been through these examples but i'm going to hit them very quickly just two examples here actually three and we're going to look at judges chapter 9 verse 50. and we're going to look at abimelech and abimelech is the son of gideon gideon was a judge in israel and gideon amen had many sons but he had a son by a concubine and abimelech is a son by a concubine he's the illegitimate son but he wants to take his father's place after his father dies and so through conspiracy amen and through trickery he takes he takes the place of his father it says verse 50 then then went abimelech to tebez and it camped against thibas and took it and there was a strong tower within the city and the other fled all the men and women in all they of the city and shut it to them and got them up to the top of the tower and abimelech came into the tower and fought against it and went hard into the door of the tower to burn it with fire and a certain woman cast a piece of millstone upon abimelech's head and all to break his skull i love this story i love these little things in the bible amen because when you see the message when you see the seals open amen now your bible becomes a new book you can never read the bible the same way amen because every character and every story and type and shadow's been typing and shadowing the story out so here we have the antagonist here we have the enemy he's an impostor judge in israel he has no right to leadership amen but through deception amen he's killed off all the natural line through the through the true wives of gideon and now he is ex he is exalted himself into a position that's not his nobody put him in that position he did it through trickery he did it with conspiracy and then he did it and he and he exalted himself to a position but everyone who's been exalted will be a base everyone who's exalted self will be amazed but those who've abased themselves will be exalted so here he is amen abimelech is a is a type of the antichrist the bemalek is a type of satan amen doing the same thing that satan did that lucifer did and here he comes as an imposter judge over israel as a as an heir to gideon's position amen that he did not get legally that he did not get correctly he did it by deception and now he comes up to a city and he's going to bring the judgment upon them because they're not bowing to him they're not they're not bowing to his authority so he comes to the city to bring them back subject to him amen but in that certain place there's a strong tower that the righteous run into and are saved because christ the lord is our strong tower amen so these people ran into the tower of christ the lord they're in the word amen and when they climb into the tower the tower took them over the heads of their enemies now in the lord now those that were attacked are higher than their attacker and so i love the story says a woman not a warrior not a soldier not a philosopher not a priest but a woman took a piece of millstone not even the whole millstone just a piece of the millstone and stone is always a type of revelation she took a piece of the of the revelation a portion apart and she and she rolled it over the tower that she was in and it come down and it break his skull where the thinking and reasoning comes from how did this woman defeat abimelech not through strength not by my but by my spirit saith the lord she was in christ and in christ she was lifted up above her enemies and to destroy him all she had to do was take a piece of a revelation that she had and roll it over the top she didn't have to be strong she didn't have she didn't have to be a marksman she didn't have to have weapons all she had to do was take this piece of stone and drop it off the tower and it break his skull where the thinking and reasoning is i tell you the enemy today is that reasoning it was the enemy in the garden it's the enemy today we look at so many things out here as the enemy enemy enemy enemy but if the enemy was always reasoning against the word of god that was the original enemy that's the enemy today so how in the world am i going to overcome the reasoning and intellect of a being amen that was perfect in wisdom in the day that he was made amen it's not going to be strength it's not going to be power but it's going to be the spirit of god that is energized faith in a word of god and if i can take even a piece of that word of god and drop it out of the tower i'm in i can break the thinking the reasoning the skull the mind of the enemy and break the power amen the stronghold of that enemy in my life hey amen in the message the world is falling apart you say well i tell you i believe you haven't got no you ain't got no thought coming i love this and that's right you say i think this and you haven't got a thought i haven't either the bible says the mind that was in christ be in you and he was always about the father's business so that's the only thought you have to have to have what god said about it not what somebody else said but what god said that's all there is to it he said let every man's word be a lie and mind be the truth see that's the thing to cut the world back together that but they won't receive it now we know they won't because they never did that's the thing to fight with is the words just not what somebody else says not with reasoned out but just what god has given me to believe what did that woman take she took something that was in her hand what do we need what did shamgar use something that was in his hand what did david use he used the sling that he had in his hand amen and he picked up five stones which represented faith amen and he had revelation and he slung it at the at the devil amen we don't have to have great big mighty things in the eyes of the world or great big abilities what we need is simple faith in the word of god to believe that what he said is still true if it was ever true it's always true if it's true for another it can be true for me too amen let's go back to genesis chapter 3 back to the original fall in the garden it was amazing what god did because when god cursed the serpent we know that the serpent was an upright being walking talking close to man but not man he was a beast of the field and brother branham said he was a giant of a fella a great big fella so it's it's it it looks like what brother branham's saying that the head of the serpent was probably higher than adam's head and through his exalted thinking by the anointing of satan he began to bring reasoning to the woman so when he was cursed we know his curse had to do with changing a structure so there could never be that kind of fall again where his seed could never cross again but when god cursed him god put him all the way down he put his head on the ground when god cursed the serpent he took the serpent that was like a man amen that was subtle that was wise to the ways of the world that could reason that could speak he was a bigger man than adam that her husband his head was higher and his reasoning under the anointing of devil the devil could out reason eve so when god cursed him he changed all of his structure amen and he took him and put him flat on the ground amen and put him on the ground and put his head on the ground and then look at verse 14 and the lord god said unto the servant because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman in between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel in the prophecy he put the head of the serpent under the foot of the seed of the woman all of this symbology god writes everything he writes in the bible for a reason that reasoning was brought low amen and there's going to be amen the seed of the woman is going to crush that serpent under its foot amen so it's driving the thinking back to the ground because it's nothing but carnal thinking amen there's nothing but earthly fleshly carnal thinking amen in the heel amen of the seed of the woman will drive the head of that serpent into the dust of the dirt of the ground because it's nothing but carnal sensual natural thinking praise gone so then we know there's there's another glimpse at the prophecy that the apostle paul brings us in romans 16 20 he says in the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet surely that means you must be part of the seed of the woman you must be part of the christ seed amen the royal seed of abraham which is christ which is a singular seed amen and you must be part of that same seed and part of that same prophecy in order for paul to pick it up and bring in romans and say the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly who's he talking to he's talking to the body of jesus christ which is the church amen so where where is that reasoning supposed to be under your feet where is that high exalted intelligent thinking supposed to be under your feet now how are you going to put it under your feet not by debate not by yelling at the devil not by screaming not by yelling not by intellectual wisdom not by understanding something more not by putting them in place with your mental prowess none of that will work how do you put him under your feet amen the the feet is represents the body of the seed of the woman and the body of the seed of the woman is the word made flesh so he's to be under the word under the word amen so how do i put him under my feet when i manifest the word and i stay with the word and i allow the word by my my subjection to my headship when i allow the word to flow through me amen then i become the word made flesh the word is made flesh in my flesh when i surrender and obey the word amen and the word now lives its life through me amen and that puts the devil in his place under the feet which is under the manifested word it's not your physical foot you can stomp stomp stomp this is a spiritual position you've been elevated higher by the word amen he's been brought lower by the word you never overcome by debate you never overcome amen you're never to become a snake handler to look at him and handle it and reason it and think about it amen you're just to keep it under the word always under the word under the word under the word and the word made manifest is always amen driving the head of that serpent back into the earth where it comes from it's carnal it's sensual using reason to touch your affections to touch your thoughts your memory all of those things are the carnal part of you the natural part of you and he's always using his reason his tactics to entice the natural part of you but you're to put that back down in its place by the word let's look at judges chapter 4. this is another one of those examples i'm going to use back to judges chapter 4. excuse me and i'm going to begin in verse 17. this example we've used on a couple of occasions it comes from the time period when deborah was judged over israel and deborah was the fourth judge of israel representing the fourth stage of life for the wheat sea when it comes back to being in bride form when it's christ in the formation of his bride so now you have a woman who's a prophetess who's a judge over israel it's just amazing and in that dispensation there's going to be a victory over the enemy but the victory was told to barack because you asked me to come with you amen the victory won't be for your honor but the victory will come by the hand of a woman and i want to look at that here in verse 17. how be it sasera fled away on his feet to the tent of jail the wife of heber the canaanite for there was peace between jaben the king of hazard in the house of hebrew the canine and jail went out to meet cesara now so you'll know cesaro is the enemy cesaro is the bad guy cesar is the antagonist remember every story every character they're typing out the same story amen barack deborah and barack went barack is leading the armies of the lord they're defeating cesaro's army caesarea runs away and he goes to hide and he's going to go hide in the tent of a woman amen because that enemy has been hiding in the tent of a woman through seven church ages as it hides in the church he's been hiding out in the tent of a woman amen through the through the catholic church in the protestant denominations amen and he goes on to say and jail went out to meet cece and said unto him turn in my lord turn into me fear not and when he had turned in unto her into the tent she covered him with a mantle and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to drink for i am thirsty and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink and covered him and again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man doth come and inquire of thee and say is there any man here that thou shalt say no then jail hebrews wife took a nail of the tent a tent stake has anybody ever seen a tent stick for a big tent not one of those little bitty pop-up ones but okay took the nail of a tent and took a hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail in his temples and fastened it to the ground for he was fast asleep and weary so he died so what did she do when he was in her tent when the deceiver was there she took a tent stake and put it over his temples and drove it right through his thinking and right through his thinking that carnal reasoning that enticing thinking she drove it right through and pinned it to the ground where that kind of thinking comes from amen i love the bible let's go to chapter 5 verse 24. this is when they begin to shout praises and sing of her victory in chapter 5 verse 24 said um blessed above women shall the jail the wife of heber that cannot be blessed shall she be above women in the tent he asked water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter and a lordly dish she put her hand to the nail on her right hand to the workman's hammer and with hammer she smokes this era she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples at her feet he bowed he fell he laid down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead where did this mighty lord captain of a mighty army they said he had 900 iron chariots and he lorded over israel for 20 years and kept them in bondage amen how did he fall he fell in the tent of a woman when he was coming in there to hide and then trying to get her to be part of the deception but she knew what she was going to do she was going to drive that thinking of his right back to the earth where it came from and it said she smote off his head amen knocked off that whole source of reasoning knocked off the whole source of intelligence that's contrary to the word of god and he fell he bowed down at her feet he fell where at her feet he was knocked from his high position and fell to the feet the feet of a woman and the lord god of peace shall shall bruise satan under your feet he bowed and fell at the feet of a woman praise be to god don't go buy a nail don't go get a hammer we've been given the word of god and the word of god will defeat the devil anywhere anytime under any condition let's look at deuteronomy chapter 28 my praise be to god deuteronomy 28 verse 13. deuteronomy 28 and 13 and the lord shall make thee the head and not the tale and thou shall be thou shalt be above only and thou shall not be beneath if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god do you want to be the head or the tail do you want to be above or below here's the secret it says the lord shall make thee you will never make yourself you will never exalt yourself you will never lift yourself you will never climb your way up but the lord will make thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if if if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord like god which i command thee this day to observe and to do them if israel wanted to be the head and not the tail if they wanted to be above and never below god would put them in that position if they humbled themselves to the word if they humbled their reasoning humbled their thinking humbled their emotions humbled their affection humbled their desires and humbled themselves and lowered themselves below the word of god then the word of god would lift them up and they would be the tail and not the head always above and never below and they would never have to lift themselves up they would get up by going down and if this bride ever wants to be lifted up she's got to first go down under the word of god under the messenger for the age she has to be under this word obedient to this word amen surrender to this word and if we stay a surrender to the word of god subjecting to our head then he will exalt us and make us the head and never the tail amen let's go to judges now back to judges this is the other example that we saw on sunday judges chapter 16 and the story of samson when moses gave the law of a nazarite samson was called to be a nazarite from his from from the womb from birth when they gave the law of a nazarite in numbers he said all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head the nazirite vow was a valve separation where somebody was completely separated from the world and dedicated only to god amen it's a separation and a dedication amen and no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separated himself to the lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of his hair of his head grow so the the uncut locks of hair in his head they represented his nazirite vow and showed that he was under a vow and consecrated and dedicated to god amen for for a period of time for a purpose or whatever and we know god called a samson to be dedicated for his whole life to be separated out for god only and to be dedicated his whole life but we saw on sunday he began to play around with delilah let's pick that up in judges 16 verse 18. yeah judges 16. sorry i'm in the wrong book judges 16 18. and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called the lords of the philistines saying come up this once for he hath showed me all his heart then the lords of the philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him now i want you to catch the imagery here here is samson amen he's supposed to be under nazarite val dedicated to god he's supposed to be a deliverer of israel to deliver them from the hands of the philistines but delilah this woman this enticing woman amen that represents the false church amen she is enticed and she she has so uh allured samson amen and so troubled him so pushed him until he finally told the secret of his strength amen and then she laid him down in her lap now he's bowing down upon delilah and now she is higher than he now his head is in her lap she's holding his head she has been so successful in this deception that he has now she has lured him to sleep he's no longer alert he's no longer attentive he's no longer vigilant he's gone to sleep and he's in her lap now she's lording over him and in that situation she cuts off all his hair he loses his covenant with god and then he no longer has strength because his strength never come from him his strength came from a commandment of the lord and as long as he kept that commandment nobody could defeat him but the minute he left the commandment of god he lost all of his strength and if we have any strength if we if we could stand up here for days and share testimonies with you what god has done and god has healed and god has delivered and god has worked supernatural and you can look at that that's what samson had done he had testimonies of fighting them here testimonies of killing them there testimonies testimonies testimonies amen but now he was being lured into subjecting himself to a woman and lying upon her lamb amen and when he went listen listen very carefully when he left the word of god none of his testimonies would help him anymore when he gave away a secret and subjected himself to that woman and laid upon her lap and she stripped away his covenant when he was no longer subject to the covenant of god put him in he he could tell testimonies all day long and he had no strength because he left the word of god no matter what's happened in the past no matter how mighty god has come on our behalf do not get lured to sleep in this day and don't let your don't let your head be subject to a false teaching don't let your head become subject to a false woman amen you stay with the word of god and you stay with the true headship of the word in this day amen and don't let don't let anything false lord over you and strip you away and get you into a position where now you're disobedient to the very commandment of separation that he's called us to because you may have had mighty things happen in the past but you leave the word there's no more strength because it wasn't your strength it wasn't my strength it was his strength but i want to read verse 21 but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down the gauze and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven praise be to god god has not forgot his covenant he's just waiting for us to come back into the covenant and we know when samson humbled himself and repented and sacrificed himself completely to the will of god in his death he wrought a greater victory than he did in all of his life no matter what's happened just let the hair begin to grow back come back in the covenant come back in the covenant of the seven seals come back under the revelation of the word and come back to obedience and a consecrated life and separation only to god and watch the strength come back through humility and then psalms 3 3 says but thou o lord are a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of mine head we don't have the strength to lift our own head but he's my shield and my glory and he is the lifter of my head what does it mean when he lifts your head he gives you a revelation let's look at psalms 27 together psalms 27 verse 1. psalms 27 and 1 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid look at who david's looking at dave is not looking at himself dave is not looking at his previous exploits and all that he did he's not saying i did this and i did this and i did that he said the lord is my salvation the lord is my lie i won't be afraid because he's my salvation i won't be afraid because he's my light of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise up against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after then i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion what is it david had david had nothing but confidence in what god could do and what god would do in the time of trouble david didn't say i'll get my sword and i'll do no that's the mistake samson made by his testimony samson when when he lost the covenant when the woman stripped him away of the word and he was no longer under a word covenant with god he stood up and he shook himself and said i will go out as before he had gotten confidence in himself and he was defeated david had no confidence in himself but he had absolute confidence in the god who called him and the god who anointed him he knew what god would do and i will inquire in this temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide in me he shall set me up upon a revelation and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about when god picks me up and puts me on the revelation amen that's also the secret of his tabernacle this revelation that that is the third pool that's the little room that's the in the pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle when he brings you into that secret he sets your feet upon a rock amen because that secret reveals to you the hidden mystery in the back part of god's mind and it shows you your place in that mystery and he lifts you up and he puts you upon a rock and now your head is above the head of all of your enemies not because you're smarter not because of anything you've done or figured out because he lifted you up in the secret of his pavilion he drew you to the secret of his pavilion he hid you in the secret of his tabernacle and he lifted you up by giving you a revelation of the mystery of god amen and he told you your place in that mystery and put you on a firm foundation of revelation and now your head is lifted above the head of your mind not by what you and i have done but by what he's done amen it's all by revelation in the word then he goes on to say and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yeah i will sing praises unto the lord i want you to look at this oh my goodness all the enemies were still there the armies that wanted to eat up his flesh they were still there amen his enemies were still all around nothing changed with the number of enemies nothing changed with the location of enemies what changed is david was brought into the secret of his pavilion to the secret of his tabernacle and set upon a rock and now his revelation and understanding was higher than that of all the enemies around about him and now although the situation hadn't changed now he's singing with joy because he's standing upon the rock and his revelation and understanding is higher than that of all the enemies how is it you can be happy in the midst of a trial because you've been set upon a rock why is it you can rejoice when things seem to be falling apart how can you come to church on your worst day at work amen and after the second song you're in a different place and you're praising god and thanking him for all that he is and the wonderful things that he's done because he sets you up on a rock amen and now you understand your life and you understand what's going on you understand what the enemy is trying to do and you understand what god is trying to do and now you just surrender yourself to it let him bring you on the rock and let that revelation get your thinking higher than the thinking of the enemy all around and the enemy can still be there but it doesn't matter because he was higher the enemy is always trying to bring his head higher than your head trying to bring wisdom over your revelation trying to bring a greater reasoning and understanding over your revelation but christ when he lifts us up by revelation he puts our head over the head of our enemies and that's never a position you can put yourself he has to lift you to that position praise god oh my goodness i want to preach all night this is our victory this is the path to victory this is where we win this is how we defeat the devil amen it's not by being stronger wise or better praying more coming to church more often it's by allowing god by surrendering to this word and following him as he leads you into the secret chamber and sets you up upon a rock and then you understand what's going on in your life you understand why life has to be hard you understand why enemies are gathered about and why they want to eat up your flesh and why they want to destroy you because you're the very vessel he wants to use to destroy satan's kingdom and now you can sing with joy because greater is he that's in me than he that's all around and he that's in me amen was the one that was meant to be me from before the foundation of the world i come from god i'm going back to god and there's not a thing a devil on this earth can do to stop that journey from god to the earth to express god to go back to god and now upon this rock my head is above the head of all of my enemies say what you will do what you want throw all the errors that you want but i'm safe because of the revelation amen praise be to almighty god first samuel chapter 5. when god wanted his people to have victory in this day he opened the seals when god wanted his children to overcome what no church age had been able to overcome he opened the seals which was what opening up the mystery of god and when he opened up the mystery that he had held in the back part of his mind that was unfolded in a three-fold manner when he opened that he gave us the key to overcoming when he wanted us to have the final victory in the final battle he opened seals so how are we going to have victory through the open word through the opening of the book when under the opening of those seals the bible became a new bible amen it was opening of the word he took the seals off the word he took the he he took the mystery out of the back part of his mind and he brought it down to his bride amen all of these things amen they mean something to us what's he doing he's setting us up on a rock amen this is the key to victory first samuel chapter 5 verse 1. when the uh children of eli the two sons of eli had taken the ark in the battle to win over the philistines they lost the ark and then verse chapter five verse one it says in the philistines took the ark of god and brought it unto ebenezer into ashdod when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it unto the house of dagon and set it by dagon and when they have ashed out a rose early in the morning tomorrow behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord and they took dagon and set him in his place again i love this the israelites had lost the access to the word they lost it because they didn't hold it with any value anymore they were trying to use the word and make god amen fight for them when they had totally abandoned his word so they lost the word and the lord they went to the philistines the philistines brought into the house of dagon their god and they believed that their god had gotten them victory amen over the god of israel so they brought the ark in and the next morning when they come in dagon is flat on his face the image the idol bowing before his head came lower than the ark the ark's not very tall so when they brought it in dagon was lording over the word of god this false church this false doctrine this doctrine of devils was lording over the ark but by the next morning dagon's head was lower than the ark and he was bowing at the feet of the ark so what did they do what any good denomination would do they picked dagon back up they brought their doctrine of trinitarian baptisms that women preachers and all that they set it back up so that it could lord over the word again praise god almighty amen verse 4 and when they arose early tomorrow the tomorrow morning behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and the head of dagen and both palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold only the stump of dagon was left to him god said you didn't get the point amen so they set him back up and the next time he fell off came his head reasoning false understanding intellectualism now he took off his head and his hands when he reasoned and what he did is now gone the only thing left is a stump and that head can never lord over the word of god again god has taken his head off like david took the head of the giant off amen the head was defeated amen he took his head off and now they had a stump so what did the philistines do the only reasonable thing for a denomination to do they got the word out of their midst amen amen they now the word took off the head the wrong understanding of the wrong doctrine so they did the only reasonable thing for a denomination to do they said we can't have this word here anymore they put it on a cart and sent it back to israel instead of surrendering and humbling god took the head clear off of that thing and that's exactly what he did in this age he took the head off every false doctrine of trinitarian baptisms amen the wrong understanding of the godhead he took the head clear off of that thing and what did they do they wanted to now worship the stump and give offerings to the stuff and send the word of god away but oh thank god we're on the other end and we saw the word coming back to israel coming back to the people it belonged with us and it came back to us amen may we value what god has returned to us praise god let's turn to matthew chapter 8 and we're going to close with this couple thoughts here matthew chapter 8. and verse 19 matthew chapter 8 verse 19. and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee with the sword with thou goest and jesus said unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nest but the son of man hath not where to lay his head jesus come to earth and when he was there there was no place for his head to rest so where will his head find rest let's go to acts chapter 7. acts chapter 7 verse 48. in acts 7 48 it says how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the lord and where is the place of my rest when jesus was here there was no place for him to lay his head because there was no place for him to lay his head amen they they missed their opportunity amen and we know that the headship in our day has come down now jesus says when the son of man returns will he find faith in the earth why there has to be a place for that head to rest not with temples made with hands but a body house that prepared me and where is my place of rest amen where will the headship rest the headship will rest on the body where's the body i believe with my faith i'm part of it i'm looking at part of it amen where the head now can come to rest the devil has been fighting to put his head above the word amen but the word has come back in the headship this day to take its proper place amen at the top amen and bringing every other headship down back to the ground and under the feet of this body amen praise god jesus asked him a question in matthew 21 he said did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and is marvelous in your eyes and he never explained anything he said you're missing did you ever hear he he points them to a scripture and doesn't explain it i think he preached the same way when he was preaching through the seventh angel pouring through a scripture and never said did you ever consider this do you remember that scripture then he moved on and he said the headship is here the cornerstone amen is here and christ is the mystery of god revealed he said as the head was took up from the grave so must the body follow him into eden therefore the body cannot recognize any other headship but the headship of the word so the devil is trying every day to get you and i to get another headship other than the word and you think well i'm not leaving the message i mean i'm not going anywhere i'm going to be back here on sunday that's not the point if he can get you to think different about the word of god he's working in the mind he's not trying to get your body into another church amen he's not trying to get you to leave this church and go into the world he may do that next step the first step is to get you to reason in your mind about the word of god so the first step is to come in and try to get the headship of lucifer over your head and whenever we leave our god-given headship which is the revealed word for our day amen you cannot tackle this devil with your own head the only head that can take that head is the headship of christ that's come down in this day and if you're connected to that head that head is always over his head he said no denomination can put anything to it for whosoever shall take one word away from it or add one word to it it took away from it you're dead hybrid right there she's back here this testimony in her hands the filthiness of her fornications committing in spiritual adultery again the very word that she claims to believe therefore it is the word or nothing i believe we've come to that day it has to be for us the word or nothing he the word how do you know it's right he the word is vindicated he the word properly vindicated is the headship the head of the church he is the word i want to say is this word that's come to us in this day been properly vindicated that is the headship over the church he is the word the headship he is properly identified vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person showing forth himself in vindication is the direct proof to the entire body you don't need creeds then denominations has perished but the headship itself recognized in the body by personal identifications what personal identification the sign of the messiah that he did thousands of times showed that the son of man was present it was christ he was brother branham said he is here he said it's not me you're touching it's him the body by personal identification is he identifying himself proves the headship to the body then we are united under one vindicated headship that is christ the word of god not under any church then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of god is within you so now the headship is a kingdom and the kingdom's in you so where's the head where's the headship where where did that cloud go that came down in 1963 that head is a kingdom and the kingdom's in you the kingdom of god is within you said the bible jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and god was won and the word and god is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as adam and eve in the beginning in the garden of eden the threefold mystery of god his body oh my that headship will lift you up upon a rock that headship would put your head above all the heads of your enemies that headship has taken the head off dagon that headship has taken the head off goliath remember when brother branham first went out and left his church to go into the field he said i'm going as david fighting goliath why because somebody had to take the head off that giant [Music] that giant of unbelief and now there's another headship come on the scene colossians 1 17 says and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence that's the second fold of the threefold purpose he wants to be the headship in our lives he wants to have the preeminence again in crisis the mystery of god revealed he says but i'm talking about the headship of christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he christ is risen and has paid the price and raised up the head or the body the devil can't stand it so what's happened the answer to the devil's question the brotherhood said it's not me it's him the answer to the devil's question is not me i'm not going to answer your question i'm not going to come back with you i'm not dealing with you the answer to the question is the headship has come and i'm united with the head and that head is over your head so there's nothing you're going to say to me anymore to get me to deviate from what the headship brought in this aid and now you you are brought under the feet of this body because the headship is attached to this body now and this body is risen higher than the false understanding of the word amen raised up the body the devil can't stand it he wants his head to be higher than your head but we're not relying on our our head we're attached to his head now we have no thought coming we just take the word devil can't say that that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are set up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness his scheme has been uncovered by the risen resurrected christ and the headship over his body and i say thank god for the word that's been restored thank god for the headship that has come down but the headship didn't come down amen to be a book on your shelf the headship come down to be a kingdom and that kingdom was to be in you and you attached to that kingdom that head has lifted you above the carnal amen and put the enemy under your feet amen not by your efforts but by the headship the original headship of the original word has come back and is connected to the body and now the headship is moving in the body finishing the work and defeating the devil by what by us believing receiving submitting to the word that's been restored in this hour how hard is it it's as easy as being able to say that's what he said i submit to it that's what the word of god says that's what's written in the word of god we'll take it that way what does that do that puts your head over the enemy's head and the minute you begin to say well i think that was brother branham's opinion say god brought us his word he restored the word he brought us back to the original teaching in the apostle paul [Music] that's the headship the word that has come back to the church and that is what's lifting our head above the head of our enemy in this word that's been given to us in this day is the stone that'll go to the head of the enemy it is the tent stake that'll drive the head back to the ground it is the piece of millstone that you can roll out of the tower to break the skull of the enemy it all has to do with the mind battle and overcoming by a revelation of the word amen let's all stand i love this word more and more and more all the time amen god gave us the very thing we needed to overcome and that was the opening of the word let's never neglect the opening of the word it was the secret ingredient that we'd been waiting for for seven church ages and now it's here man let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you for your word god i'm so thankful lord that we live in a day where you have given us eyes to see what you have done god is so miraculous and so marvelous lord it brings us such confidence when you see how thoroughly you vindicated yourself and you are the headship that was vindicated over the body and you've come lord to unite with this body this bride to bring victory in the end time god forgive us help us never to reason your word help us never to get sick sucked into intellectualism or by affections or our reasonings be drifted away lord from the word that's been restored in this hour but give us strength by your spirit to stay with your word for that is our victory well we love you we thank you for what you've done i thank you god for a revelation that you've lifted us up in to bring us higher lord than the head of our enemy so that we would know lord what you've had in mind from before the foundation of the world and what it is you're doing with us in this age it's not a mystery to us anymore it's your plan god i pray now that you would just take us as we subject ourselves to you as we surrender lord take us and use us for your glory defeat the enemy lord using these vessels of clay for we're surrendered to you without you we can do nothing but with you all things are possible god do the impossible yourself through these vessels we love you we confess that we believe you lord we surrender to you and jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you thank you
