certain routine because we schedule it but I don't want to get stuck in that and miss that everyone is an opportunity to hear from God that this isn't just a routine this isn't just a schedule it's an opportunity and I don't want to miss my opportunity to hear by God's appointed way through God's appointed means to speak to me and to receive something I need personally from God we should take it

into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and God called the dry land Earth and the Gatherings together of the waters called he sees and God saw it was good 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and Herb building seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose see this in itself upon the Earth and it was so and God and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the three yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good may the Lord add the blessing from the reading of the scripture he all may be seated praise the Lord this is the first time that uh we're going to preacher on the midweek Wednesday so I don't know if I can go longer so because I know you're you're going to work tomorrow praise God but uh I'm just thankful for the Lord for this great privilege to stand in front of you praise the Lord I just want to be a blessing it's that's all in my heart again [Music] praise God you know I did not put it in the PowerPoint because okay I've again if I said something that is not according to what your your church belief just charge it in my into my ignorance and forget it okay praise the Lord say I just want to speak about condemnation by representation then I want to go into the home church and the pastor what are the home Church what is the pastor praise God in that way we know why we are here and we know why we have a pastor what is the pastor praise God say sometimes people like I say they don't understand what the pastor is they don't understand what the home church is also they think it is just a gathering praise the Lord so how important it is we need to know okay praise God hallelujah see because back home now I am the eldest all my elders pass away so in our group I'm the eldest so back home I can say I can say anything because I am the eldest okay praise God see meaning that uh you know I will be the next one to go that's that's the reality amen praise God so again I just won I just want to be a blessing okay praise God now so we we know we are in we are in the end time and I believe myself this is the last generation seeing that we don't need that's why the prophet said we don't need anyone to write our history praise God our history has been written we are just fulfilling what has been written for us praise the Lord say hallelujah and last Sunday I told you we are in the head say we are in the Ice Age say and we are in the mind age say that's why everything that's happening in our surrounding has something to do with your eyes with your ear and with your mind right praise God that's why all this of the the Facebook the tick tock I don't know you know I only have messenger okay I don't know about this praise God say hallelujah what is the purpose of that for you to see for you to hear praise God because they want to control your mind same praise God that's why we have so many conspiracy theories in our time say like uh you know when this pandemic hit uh hit us you know they said brother Leinster we do not want to be vaccinated because that is the mark of the beast I said what where can you find that in the scripture where can you find that in the message say that the vaccine is 666. praise God you know the Mark is on the forehead not not in the shoulder if you will be vaccinated on the forehead maybe I will consider it okay but no right praise God that's why where did you where did you get the teaching in the f b right we have m b see they had the Facebook we have the message book saying praise God because they want to control your mind praise God see just listen everything that's happening today is already been written right praise God when this covet come they don't know the name they don't know what it is that's why they call it novel praise God but they said you know when I studied the the virus only six virus SARS bar um copied virus they have named but this servant they have no name but it comes from the six praise God say it's a hybrid that's why the prophet called it gem germ warfare see how do you know that brother Nestor because he said people will do this they will they will going to have a face mask they use sanitizer they go into the cave they will not go up see and they will go to okay to the hospitals see Dr so and so is that what we did say so it only fulfilled what the prophet said so we know I've been telling it to them don't you worry praise God say don't you worry see because Hallelujah we have a protection you know we have double protection right praise God we have I'm vaccinated all my people got vaccine praise God then my people said is that our protection no that our protection is the Holy Ghost see we are protected by the vaccine one portion and then we also protected by the Holy Ghost another portion always double see praise God hallelujah there was sister told me Pastor they said if I got vaccinated after two years I'm going we are going to die I said praise God can they do it earlier who wants who wants to live in this kind of world right praise God I said where where whoever it is same that's why I told them saying when when when it is still in in the original Hobbit 19 I told them it will mutate because it is hybrid see praise God it will mutate up to the fourth generation but when it comes to the third and fourth generation see the strength will subside see praise God that's you know in the beginning Abraham's blood they can mix with the rare relatives but in the time of Moses you cannot marry your relatives up to the fourth generation because the blood become weak praise God so same thing Hallelujah same I've been telling it to the church you know don't you worry the Delta will come into our country even even if we close our door the almightron also come see when our door is closed I told them because the it's it is not original see that's why your government is trying to find where it come from okay because that virus cannot enter to the human it needs something to pass through okay Alleluia but this conspiration you know that's why I told you just read the message and you will understand what's happening in our surrounding this is just very mild what's happened to us is mild because the prophet said say praise God there is more horrible thing will come he will he will tell to do he will tell to the fall of the air praise God to to eat the Flesh of the people then then he said that is airborne disease while they are standing praise God this this fall of the earth air will eat their flesh and they will not die they want to die they they will not die because Satan uh the Dead he is in quarantine his implications Hallelujah praise God say that's why I've been telling it to the people this is just mild if if these things you know the mild things you are already full of fear then what will the you know the next day this is just you know this uh something like uh Prelude you know to the taste more greater things that will happen see nobody you know when I'm reading the scripture nobody in his right mind um praise God will accept the mark of the beast praise God say that and then they they know they will go to hell once they had the mark right but when these things happen the government now can control the people in our country you cannot buy you cannot sell without that certificate okay Hallelujah see that's how the message is because these things happen we know it we are expecting it praise God same then it took away the fear in our heart praise the Lord Hallelujah saying praise God so they want to control now praise God but by the grace of God like I told you we have our own MB okay they had their FB we have our MB then we have the mind of Christ amen praise God hallelujah praise the Lord say now the scripture that we read your praise God that is the same text that the ma that the prophet use uh in his message condemnation by representation okay praise God when God created when God created the trees the herb you know they were commanded they were they were ordered to reproduce according to their kind praise God in order for them to do that God give them seeds say praise God hallelujah but we know something happened you know praise God we know something happened now to the Sid right because of the knowledge of the people they tampered it praise God see Hallelujah see then then uh we have so many High breathing praise God it's beautiful it's nice but uh praise God that is not the way that is not the will of God say same thing with the church right when the church is started in the Pentecost that is the original Church praise God it is filled with the Holy Ghost but then uh the knowledge of the people they tampered it with the doctrines you know with their own idea with their own understanding praise God until we produce denomination we produce religion praise God see that's what happened Allelujah same and then these ministers they are being sent to Seminary praise God say that's why the prophet said the cemetery you know Hallelujah say praise God but God sent them to the upper room right to wait for the Holy Ghost see Allelujah there is God's way and there is a human way man's way okay praise God hallelujah man's way always beautiful same God's way is always simple praise God hallelujah that's why people have been asking me how come that your hair still the same No Gray a few gray hair only because I just think simple I just want to eat steak that's all just be simple right Hallelujah okay yeah I like this glass simple praise the Lord same now so we are we know that we are Abraham said Okay so I you know there is the Abraham natural seed he says it they will be like the Sun or the seashore but there is a spiritual son of Abraham Seed of Abraham they said you look at the heaven count the star same praise God hallelujah says we are Abraham's sin is spiritually speaking so we we are supposed we are supposed to reproduce also praise God halleluia say so now okay I'm talking about the message churches praise God see when the message when the message churches started anywhere in the world we have problems okay because they letting down the bar see the prophet always said that don't let down the bar praise God Hallelujah stay with the message stay with the prophet the Bible is our absolute okay the message is our absolute interpretation of the Bible praise God Hallelujah say praise the Lord but then something happened you know that's why sometimes people are asking me can a message church start right and then they will end it up wrong can that happen to the message church I said look at the seven churches they start it right right you make a church the the alpha Church praise God but they ended up in darkness why because they leave their first love praise God so same thing with us you know when I accepted this message since then up to now I'm I'm preaching the same message praise God you know when I accepted when we started the church I never dreamed to have a church I never dreamed to become a minister never even in my imagination to be a minister praise God to be a pastor that's why I've been telling it to everybody if God will only allow me to choose I will not I do not want to be a pastor see people don't know what Pastor is actually praise God say they think a pastor is a pastor or he has a good life just give a little sermon then here come Hallelujah you don't know it praise God see that's why if God will allow me just to choose I will not that's why even my children I don't want them to you know unless God called them okay praise God hallelujah by the grace of God our church grow is still growing and keep on growing Same halleluia by the grace of God even in the time of pandemic our church is growing Hallelujah now back home we need another more room yeah to to put the people praise God say imagine I have three sons I'm telling you this is not Kingdom I'm the king and they are the princess I don't believe that okay but if God will call my children I will be the happiest person okay praise God if not Hallelujah I don't want them praise God it's not easy okay praise God the burden the responsibility is very very happy praise the Lord see Alleluia when we started the church praise God I've been you know in the beginning there's only 15 of us okay foreign minister eleven congregate the congregation people say imagine that there are many see when I accepted this message now you know I said Holiness Holiness praise God but imagine all of us are new in the message my people our sister they even go to The Parlor and curve you know they even sometimes have something in their makeup and they wear jeans see and they are coming to the church where some ministers in the message come and visit my place he said oh in brother National Church they are they are liberal so you can do anything praise God say but I just I just teach and preach to the people until finally praise God say it went deep into their heart and they manifested the holy life I did not force them praise God I never Force anybody praise God because me myself I did not you know I did not force myself to stop I I've been telling it to you I am not a drunkard I am not a gambler I'm not a smoker but I am a how do you say cursor I always curse imagine and God pulling you and calling you into the ministry to preach every time I speak I curse I said Lord what what I am going to do then I said Lord help me see that's all I said Lord help me You Are Holy I must be holy say then God gave me just one scripture say can two water you know how this in the spring can salt water and fresh water can they come together said that they said no the Bible said no and I said yes no and that's it I stopped cursing praise God that's why I've been telling it to the people if you are drunkard if you are a smoker you know if you do some all these vices just do it don't stop it if you smoke keep on smoke smoking see if you are a drunk I'll keep on drinking praise God right no good people will go to heaven either the bad people okay Hallelujah see praise God you just need to surrender it don't change yourself Hallelujah I did not Chase myself praise God I cannot I cannot save myself he saved me that's why I just been telling it to my go to my children praise God I'll I want them to be saved that's all in my heart I know I don't want them you know my priority is not for them to finish schooling to be the president of the company or the Philippines no I just want them to be saved that's all in my heart praise God Hallelujah see so we never let down the bar like the prophet said you know now they call me legalese that's a problem today oh brother Nest or Pastor nest of the church is very legalist praise God seems like we don't know about we don't know Grace see I said no my teeth the prophet taught us that is not my teaching you know for the woman not to cut their hair is that my teaching teaching no that's Paul that's God see if you want if you want to follow me cut your hair sister if you want to follow the lord don't do it then you want to listen to me you want to follow me praise God let's follow the lord okay praise God hallelujah say and the prophet said remember this okay once this church once the church left the original the original Foundation they will never be able to come up again praise God say hallelujah it says here can cross itself back when the grain was first planted the second place they come in then hybrid it and the first thing you know it can't never come back I asked any scholar to go with through history any church that ever left this its original Foundation any church no exception praise God even our so-called Message Church once we left praise God Hallelujah see it can never come back I asked any scholar to go with me through history any church that ever left its original Foundation has never been able to come up again when God sent Luther and he had a Revival he swept the world he but he organized it and hybrid eat with the world like the Catholic church and when he did when he did know he produced see once a message Church leave the foundation the original Foundation it will produce a bunch of Renegades see you will see it on their children say that's a problem I've been always tell it always the children suffer praise God Hallelujah see so don't let the bar down amen I believe it that's why people said oh brother NASA they are so legalists I said no holy life is our life same that is not a doctrine that is our life praise God Hallelujah say that's why we can say that he is the same yesterday today and forever see we are original right we are before the foundation of the world hallelujah praise the Lord see now we know it if it's a mother of High breathing praise God say so when the woman fall Adam went into transgression okay he is not in sin Adam believed believe believe the message say but during the time of Adam all the things that they have is the right thing there is no wrong thing say the right thing but then they disobeyed the right thing that's why it was called transgression praise God until when the when when the law come in now they know the right they know the wrong if you know the wrong thing and then you do it if you know the right thing and then you don't do it then we call it iniquity praise God Hallelujah then if we disbelief then we are in sin Hallelujah say so Adam went into transgression Hallelujah see God did not blame the woman okay because God can create another woman see when the woman fell in sin you know Adam can just tell to God God father just pull another ribs so it will be balanced okay create a new woman for me this woman is really stiff naked you know praise God but no he he did not do it he take the responsibility see that's why I'm always telling it to the church you know in a family okay I don't believe in divorce praise God divorce is not of God praise God we don't believe divorce in the message say hallelujah see there is no such thing as divorce in the message praise God hallelujah see every time something happened in the house okay so you brother praise God you better pray and ask yourself okay that's why we live in the young young sister a young boy you know when they have this kind of uh we call it in the Philippines we have what we call the courtship you know here I don't know how they do it praise God see if something went wrong you know the prophet said this okay say once once the boy once once that boy proposes to the sister will you marry me and then the sister answer yes okay potentially potentially I'm not saying they are married potentially they are married praise God hallelujah so it's so hard to break that vow okay Allelujah in all your pastor don't ask me okay if you have some question go to your pastor huh praise God in our place Hallelujah if something happened you know I always I know you know the boy is always the man you know the boy you know praise God say praise God because he is the one that who carried the responsibility okay hallelujah praise the Lord same now when Adam says Adam is the Sid carrier she's not the woman okay praise God that's why all the responsibility is in Adam so when Adam went into transgression all his oldest generation all his children fall into sin praise God say that's why we are Sinner by representation we are condemned we did nothing wrong praise God someone did it not me not you it's Adam it's Adam's fault that's why the scripture said through one man through the name Adam praise God say we are condemned praise God that come in we die because of one man okay praise God Hallelujah say so when when you read the the Book of Genesis when God separated the land and the water praise God say then the vegetation they did the plant appear you know praise God when the plant they they put praise God say one plant here another plant here praise God but every plant they only represented by one name say even how many fruits you have the apple tree you put it in 10 basket full of Apple you call all that you call them all Apple only one name praise God same even the animal Alleluia all lion they only have one name they are represented by one name lion see the elephant is the same praise God hallelujah so same thing with us as a sinner we are represented by one name Adam say praise God hallelujah then God did something to redeem us right Jesus he went to the cross paid the debt that he did he did not own praise God see we did nothing also to be saved praise God by one name again we are represented to be saved saved by representation again Hallelujah so it's so easy right Hallelujah we did nothing we become sinner by representation we are saved we are so we did all we did nothing also by representation okay Hallelujah now we are where we will go in now to our the home Church amen I love the subject but uh praise the Lord so again this is a little bit uh you know sometimes so hard the prophet said when you go on the teaching message is very tricky okay you are you are walking on the thin ice okay I'm glad you have a good pastor here okay so if anything that uh a problem or you have some question you ask it don't ask me that then if the pastor think that's uh praise God hallelujah you know so the the prophet said so we believe the prophet okay praise God hallelujah he says here and now tomorrow is Sunday and there will be Sunday school the churches the reason we have our services in the afternoon on Sunday is so we won't interrupt any service at all even the prophet you know he's I mean his famous is a lot of people follow him but he still respect The Fellowship of the other churches praise God because he said we believe that every Christian ought to have a home church that they go to every Christian ought to meet somewhere with Believers and wherever you meet that's the church the whole purpose of redemption is fellowship then you don't want to Fellowship I don't understand you praise God you know in this pandemic when this uh praise God hit us I'm telling you day one I'm already when our government we have a total lockdown okay nobody can go out of their house only one person he will receive he they will give they will give him the quarantine pass for only one person it is not transferable see so we stay home and my people stay home then I asked them to bring all the video come at home then we went we go online it's so good you know until now the government open open it now we can go to the church you know I was thinking I think we can do that online services no more renting you know we are renting the church and it's very expensive we are renting our church we are in the city of Manila okay that is that is the capital city of the Philippines anywhere in the world when you are in the city like if you are in New York it's very expensive right see in Moscow it's very expensive same thing in the Philippines Manila is the capital city so it's very expensive just a piece of plan in Manila it will cost you you know a one square meter or ten square feet it will cost you 10 000 U.S so you can imagine how much the land in the you know so how much the rent is very expensive and now here we are we can do online my people you know can watch me anywhere they were then they can set by the grace of God they are sending you know their tightings through the the bank account to bank transfer and everything I said I think this is good see but then you know the Bible is not the Bible don't teach at like that we need to come to the church praise God hallelujah say that's why the prophet said you must have we believe that every Christian ought to have a home Church praise God that they go to praise God then it says in the discernment of the spirit a new testament Prophet is a preacher we all know that just any Minister that preaches pre that's a preacher is a prophet a new testament Prophet if we prophesying preaching not to try to edify himself to make a big name or to edifice Organics organization which he should be in our organization here I am without one but yet preaching you should be that's right everyone ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float about from pillar to pause but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church someone you pay your tithes and somewhere you help support the cause take your choice take your choice if you think in my church okay I I always tell it to the people if you are not growing in this church is spiritually then find a church that you will grow praise God see because we are talking about your soul I will die and you will die also now the problem if he is your soul praise God coming to church is not because you praise God I I like that Pastor he looks good Hallelujah no no see praise God nothing about nothing about emotion okay Allelujah you need to make sure you make your choice praise God say when you make your choice then he says then don't never disfellowship the other man because you don't belong with your group see but then discern his spirit and see and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you got Fellowship one with another you are working for one great great cause that's the cause of Christ see you need to have a home Church you know we call it home Church like the prophet said you know when if I am in my home church or church home he said I feel I feel free it is like uh when you go home then you you you pull off your tie something like that when I'm in my church home praise God I can do that I can say what I want I'm free I'm relaxed see it's your home spiritual home your church your home church is a spiritual home the pastor praise God it is like husband and wife the pastor is the husband the congregation is is the wife is spiritually speaking okay Alleluia that's why this is our spiritual family in our church I become their spiritual father and they all are my children see that's why in the book of Ephesians Paul said respect your parents in the Lord see and who is your parents in the Lord Hallelujah say praise God that's why the prophet said now he says here thirsting for life that's why I think about sometime God's Little Deer sometimes wander off from the fold there might be some here tonight that's wander away from the protection of the church so the church is our protection praise God see and protection of the love loved ones who prayed for you and help you to come back to God keep you straight come to the church and listen at the gospel there may be some in regular in online Wi-Fi that's wandered away okay praise God Hebrew 10 25 says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner as the manner of Psalm is but exhorting one another is so much the more as she see the day approaching now you are believing we are in the end time praise God there's so much more we need to come to Fellowship see when that happened to us you know I'm telling you brother and sister for us it is much better I go online in that way we don't need to pay the rent then I said okay maybe once a month or twice once every two months we are going to hold we are going to rent a big hole and then we are going to have our face-to-face meeting but God God it's not you know that is not the way see how can you practice your faith your temperance your patience see when you read that state you're of a perfect man with patience patience for what patient for you to wait for your brother to grow in faith right then how can you practice your brotherly love if you cannot see your brother Hallelujah see Allelujah praise the Lord so it is thirsting for life again I've watched many times the wolf after the deer if we can catch a little deer out to itself remember this if you are alone praise God say you are in the day you are in The Dangerous Ground okay Alleluia if he can catch a little deer out to itself that's the one they work on there's a lesson if he can catch a deer away from the herd then he that that's what the devil wants to do so to you young ladies he wants you to go out with a boy that's not a Christian to you young man he wants you to go out with some little painter Jezebel that's not a Christian that's where he wants to break you up that's where he wants it and want you he wants to suck his teeth into you and this little deer will get out to itself away from the herd this is the herd praise God see and this little deer will get out itself away from the herd that's the one the wolf worked on and to you old man or woman when you separated yourself from believers people say I can stay at home be just as good a Christian as I can at church you can't that's the word of the message that's the word of the Prophet you can the Bible said that forsake our assemble ourselves together and that's much more as we see the time coming if you're a Christian if you are a Christian okay you long to go over other Christians are and fellowship with other Christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life you can do it see find the one Hallelujah he said find the one of your choice and remainder and be a Christian brother to all of them how can you practice that to be a Christian brother say because before before you can get that Capstone what is a Capstone love what's below the Capstone brotherly love how can you practice that if you are alone okay you cannot that's why the prophet said you cannot praise God Hallelujah find the one of your choice and remainder and be a Christian brother to all of them that's the way to be a read a real Christian then we got Fellowship you got protection people love you and pray for you see that is the home church so everybody ought to have a home Church find it praise God hallelujah say discern praise God you need to discern the pastor that preaching in that church praise God hallelujah if you think that he is a servant of God then you better respect him okay praise God Hallelujah see now I'm going to the pastor just hold your seat in Hebrew 13 17 it says obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for they watch for your souls as they that must give account they will watch your soul and they are the one who will give account to your soul that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you praise God Hallelujah that's why Paul said in 37 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation see now the prophet said you never you cannot live higher than your pastor say now the hidden manna a little special a little something special what is this special not something too the blessing of the Holy Ghost oh no that's for the whole congregation but the hidden manner was a special Revelation because he had to teach the others say praise God the the only one that can break the hidden manner praise God none other than the pastor even if you read the message book back to back see that's why the prophet said this see but the hidden manner was a special Revelation because he had to teach the others see was a little more more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach others he's supposed to be is that right you'll never live no higher than your pastor you cannot have more Revelation than your pastor if you have more Revelation that's why in our church I've been telling it to the people if your Revelation in my Revelation is not the same I am not your pastor that's right see the anointing during the time of the high priest of Aeron it will hit the head first then it will go down to the body spiritually speaking this is the head and this is the body praise God Hallelujah say you'll never live no higher than your pastor you just remembered that see so because he's the Shepherd that feeds you if he is the shepherd he's got to know where the Mana is to feed the sheep is that right now a little special and watch this just a minute the Revelation the hidden Mana praise God like I told you last Sunday say this message is different we are in a different season we are not in the planting season we are not in the growing season we are not in the just in the you know in maturing season we are in the ripening see you soon no more growth praise God see like with the wheat Hallelujah it will just it will just stop growing it only need to receive light stronger light is stronger light praise God the seed cannot be ripened be the light of justification with the light of the sanctification okay again I don't want you to biscote it misquote me see we still need it okay but what I'm trying to tell you the moonlight cannot Harden cannot ripen the sin we need a very strong light praise God that's why the prophet said when the sun appeared we don't need the Moon Hallelujah we are not eating the Heavenly manner we are not eating the unleavened bread we are eating he did Mana praise God Hallelujah that's why the bride cannot rejoice with the Heavenly Mana with the unleavened bread she will only rejoice in eating the hidden manna praise God but there is somebody got appointed you know Hallelujah with a special something like this like what he said praise God so he can break that he then mother say praise the Lord a little special said and the pastor is God's angel to the church see he says here your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church Messenger to the church therefore a pastor should never leave the world but stay straight with the world praise God the pastor need to stay with the world see because he's feeding the Shepherds place because the word pastor means Shepherd look it up find out if ain't right a pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer of a certain flock to feed them praise God with what made the word of God hallelujah say now he says here in the message the question in answer the book of Hebrew praise God it's in 1957 he said if you are LED if you are spirit-led by God you become a messenger of God or an angel God's messenger God's angel is the very same word can separate it God messenger or God's angel and which has the greatest Authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit which has it we have angel from heaven with capital A we have angel on Earth with a small a then the prophet asked which has more greatest Authority the angel on the pulpit or the angel on the heaven he says the angel at the pulpit why that's why Paul said even an angel he said if an angel from heaven comes and preached any gospel to you then I the angel of the earth preach let that Heavenly Angel be a curse see so the angel Anointed with the Holy Spirit and with the word stands next to God in heaven listen your angel on the pulpit is done next to God see that's why I told you when you read that message influence there is a share of him what is the purpose of the share of him see to make you holy praise God Hallelujah say just fine where God is then you will understand where the seraphim is Between Heaven and Earth the prophet said this is the closest place between the Heaven and Earth Hallelujah say that's why the angel is standing behind this pulpit the prophet said here praise God Hallelujah he stand next to God in the heaven is Authority then the next paragraph says all powers in heaven and Earth is given into my hand go and I'll go with you whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven what you lose on Earth I will lose in heaven John 20 23 who so so ever since you remit they are remitted and whosoever since you retained they are retained you understand what the pastor is Hallelujah see that's why the prophet said the Pastor you need to stay with the world that's why you need to have a general discernment if the pastor leave the world if the man leave the word leave the man follow the word say praise God it's very clear that's why I said it's not hard the only thing that we need to do you know say just humble ourselves okay if he will humble ourselves then you will understand what is the home Church what is the pastor praise God Hallelujah say so the pastor praise God he's the angel of God behind this pulpit the pastor stands next to God Hallelujah say and the pastor it says here a lot of times these people passing through the country called Divine healer people get take them for an example you better get your mind off of them that's right you keep your mind on Christ he's the one to keep your mind on not on your pastor love your pastor and respect him he's an honorable man a man of God truly but keep your mind on Christ okay so first you need to set your mind on Christ and your affection set on Christ just respect him you need to respect your pastor as what he is as us as a river as as a reverend because he represents God to you say he represent gods to you praise God Hallelujah say that's why the pastor they were called Shepherd and the shepherd is the door to the ship praise God Hallelujah you cannot come in without entering that's why the pastor the prophet said they are the most suspicious person on Earth say praise God every time somebody stand behind his pulpit he's suspicious Hallelujah you cannot blame the prophecy you cannot blame him he has as a responsibility and it's a big and it's a heavy responsibility praise God it's not easy because he said he watched over your soul and he's accountable for that soul praise God see Allelujah now this is the vision of the Prophet beyond the curtain of time see I just want you to listen okay when he when he's when he's testifying this he said and I look coming down across the hill and there come all fruits he looked at me and come up and lick me on the hand and he patted him just then all Prince my horse so his dog his horse is there around my shoulder and begin to knicker I said no God I look up and he said all that you ever love and all that ever love you is gathered here then I said I want to see Jesus I want to see the one that I've loved and worked for and they said you can see him right now he's higher than this but someday he will come back and when he comes and when he comes where Jesus will go he will come to you first and you will be questioned on the gospel that you preach and then if you pass the test then he will go with you back to him then we will go with you back to him back to Earth and live together forever in a body fleshly body where we'll eat and drink and I said you mean he will question me in the word I preach said yes that boy speaking to me said it and I said well will Saint Paul be questioned too said certainly with his congregation I said then if Saint Paul passes it I will too I said I preach I preach it just exactly the way he did not move one word and then those Millions scream out we know that and we are resting as you and about that time I heard the voice said keep pressing on I felt myself sleep I said I don't have to go back I do I keep pressing on and I turn and look at my body and seen it move it was coming too in just a moment I was in the room again say so in another code the rejected King he says here and I hear the voice then I spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never end there mortality could never make you old and they could not cry it was just one Joy o my precious brother and they took me up and set me up on the great high place and I thought I'm not dreaming I'm looking back at my body laying down there on the bed he thought he passed he died okay praise God see he says here laying down there on the bed and they set me up there and I said oh I should not set up here they are putting him in the in the higher place he said no no no praise God and here come the war women and the men both sides just in the bloom of Youth screaming in one moment was standing there and he scream all my precious brother oh we are so happy to see you here and I said I don't understand this and then the boys and then the boys that were speaking from above from above he said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with with their people and I said yes I remember that in the scriptures said why this is when you will gather with your people I said then they will be real because I can feel it he said oh yes I said but I there's Millions there's not many branhams and the boy said they are not branhams Dame your converts that's the one that you led to the Lord and said some of them women that you think are so beautiful were better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they are screaming oh precious brother and they are screaming all at once if you haven't had what we won't be here somebody remembered this somebody has led you to the Lord praise God that you got converted see and I look around and I thought well I don't get it I said oh where is Jesus I want to see him so bad they said no he's just a little higher right up that way said somebody someday he will come to you you said you see he said you were sent for a leader and God will come and when he does he will judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not we will go in according to your teaching Jesus Will Come he will come to you see then he will be judged according for what he teach according to what you taught them first whether they go in they will go in or not according to his teaching praise God Hallelujah when I read that the prophet never said after Jesus judged me then they will he will judge you he did not say that he said so in the rejected Kings dancers this is the time he keeps saying it the same thing Jesus will come first to him and he will judge him praise God say if we pass the test than him praise God he says here whether they go in whether his people will go in or not will go we will go in according to your teaching and I said oh I'm so glad did Paul does he did did Paul that she have to stand like this does Peter have to stand like this yes I said then I preach every word that they preach I never deviate from it one side to the other were they baptized in the name of Jesus I did too where they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they thought I did too and then people and then people scream and said we know that and we know we're going with you someday back to Earth said Jesus again Jesus will come and you will be judged according to the word that you preach that you preach us and then if you are accepted at that time which you will be and said then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry and you will guide us to him and all together will go back to the Earth to live forever Hallelujah see you become Sinner by one name by Adam because of one man we have become sinner but also by one man we got saved okay that's why the scripture is very clear praise God when the Jailer in the time of Paul right he says here and they said and Paul said the Jailer ashim and brought them out and said search what must I do to be saved and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved and thy house it never said you believe all your people believe your family and and they will be saved the only requirement is somebody to believe in your house like Rahab praise God only rehab believe the two the two spies praise God in all his sibling all his relative as long as they are inside that house they are all saved praise God Hallelujah say look the Bible is the mess is very clear it says all that love you all whom do you love God will go it to give it to you see in anybody that will just give you a cold glass of water in no other way see God will reward them imagine just a one cold glass of water praise God see this message is full of grace see Hallelujah that's why I keep on telling the people this message all I can see is full of grace it's so easy right praise God you know when I was in one country there is one sister she's old then his son is not in the church but every time she go to the church his son you know he said Mama this and this and this and this see take it to the church take it to the church then he said my son wants to come to the church but he made an accident then the sister asked me what will happen to my son you know the prophet said all that you love all that loves you God will go in to give it to you I just believe that this message okay I just believe it say then he said if is that true brother Nestor I just believe it see imagine brother Branham love his dog love is horse God gave it to him how much more is people God even give him his couch see praise God how much more his people say here I'll give you one quote he says here no but it was just a great thing that the inheritance how did to us that an inheritance in the land that no one else but a close kissman could redeem that inheritance now let me just drop on a little token year that I touched on the other night to you mothers how many has prayed for your loved ones lost all right there you are again see your inheritance Paul told the Roman said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thou how shall be saved see the prophet Paul is quoting again the scripture if you have faith enough for your own self to be saved have faith enough no matter how wayward that boy is or that girl is they will be saved anyhow because they are your inheritance see praise God this church is your home the pastor is your representation praise God see the this the message said his son next to God Hallelujah the only thing God needs to do is to judge his teaching is he teaching the right thing praise God if your pastor passed that test then he will come back to you and then he will present you as his true peace see Allelujah I don't want to eat it hard okay but I think you know what I'm trying to say okay he is the door praise God one time in one place you know they have a lot of Fellowship but they have no pastor I don't understand it praise God then one time I say how can you be in the rapture without a pastor will you be in the Rapture without a pastor I said you cannot see because you cannot be perfected you need the faithful Ministry you need the pastor evangelist Prophet teacher apostle praise God say but the pastor is a special kind of man praise God Hallelujah that's why you need to choose very very carefully official Pastor praise God if he's teaching the right message Hallelujah then you need to respect him praise God see and they ask me and I asked them see you cannot be perfected because a lot of message people you know they don't believe in Pastor I said you cannot be perfected without a pastor whether you like it or not even brother Branham as a pastor praise God see that's why I said you cannot be you know the mechanical equipment say it won't it won't work you need a pastor praise God so when you have a pastor like the prophet said love him give him the double respect praise God I'm not lifting up anybody I'm also a Pastor Brian Chad is a pastor but I'm not lifting it up but I'm just telling it to the people what the pastor is he is the door to heaven okay praise God that's why sometimes we have a big problem we have a problem in the church you know brother has problem praise God that cannot be fixed cannot be sold but he still wants to come to the church with the repentant heart halleluia see then he asked me what is the solution remember this that's why I keep on telling to the people if your problem has no more solution the only solution is the pastor how can that be follow the message anybody that will love the pastor that's why that's why the prophet said those who love you those you love God will give it to you see that's how important the pastor is praise God he is God's angels to you praise God to guide you he will be accountable to your soul see that's why I'm very careful even in our church I'm very careful when I started a message when I started scripture before I give it to the people praise God see because that is the the last commandments of Jesus to the apostles if you love me feed my lamb Peter if you love me feed my sheep be there if you love me feed my sheep say if you love the Lord if the minister is a pastor love the Lord he will find he will find the food for God's children for the ship of God for the Lamb of God Hallelujah see that's why in the message you cannot feed the flocks in your wishy washy message you know praise God you cannot do that to the message believer say in the church that's why I've been telling you to the people read the message read the message in that way you will understand what I am saying I give you the quotation but if you don't read the message you don't know praise God the holy story Hallelujah say even if you read the message if you have no Pastor you will be like the eunuch remember that in the book of Acts then there is one unlearned man Phillips he said how how do I know if nobody explained it but he is a smart man Hallelujah that is what I'm telling to the people you need Pastor praise God you need home Church say Hallelujah when you are at home see yorat is you know it then here at home you're going to exercise everything Faith virtue your Temperance your patience praise God your godliness you can only do it here not in the outside so if you don't have the home Church you only love your cat cat and dog Hallelujah you will practice with them see that's why I'm telling you you're very much privileged you're better you're blessed if you have a home Church then if you're back a good pastor you know Pastor how can you discern that he's a good pastor he's studying the message and he tried to find you know to he tried to give you the the best food that he can he can give see praise God Hallelujah then he will feed you the food in juices son see we have all you know the message already told us food and your season then you will understand you will know that you are eating the fruit the food in your season why because you will bear the fruit in your season also praise God see once you eat the food and you see some definitely praise God if that food food in Jewish season is full of Holiness then your life will just filled with Holiness praise God say Hallelujah see that's why we are not afraid of this coming uh this uh pandemic this war because we are expecting it right because it's been told to us already amen that's how good the message is okay so you listen to your pastor be with your pastor that's why the prophet said be with your pastor he's also a human being respect him support him again I I don't want you to misquote me I'm not lifting up your pastor okay I've been teaching this to several churches in the Philippines praise God Even in our church okay because I believe it I believe there is something about the pastor see so don't try to uh you know say something about if you if you are if you are in this agreement with your pastor just leave the church okay sorry this I forgot this is at my church because in in our in our church I just tell it to them you know if you think you know more you know more than me you just leave the church I'm not your pastor see if you are not growing spiritually this is not your home Church find a home church that you will grow spiritually okay praise God hallelujah see so again I'm very happy for you you have a nice Church praise God and here you are a very able brother ministering to you very calm and the other brother praise God seldom you know praise God hallelujah so seldom praise God that you can see this kind of uh Church okay praise God hallelujah see so now we are in the ripening season amen that's why the message is a Little Bit Stronger so don't be surprised huh don't be surprised always so bright so bright stronger light stronger light amen Hallelujah so we all stand up so hard for me to express myself but I do believe you understand what I'm trying to say okay the pastor is the door praise God see he will be accountable for your soul see he is the one will answer for you praise God see so make sure that your pastor stay in the world if he's in the world then you have no problem okay you have no problem see that's how easy praise God the Salvation in our age you don't need to do anything oh excuse me if you don't like I say we become sinner we did not do anything okay we got saved we did not do anything see praise God if you have the right Pastor you don't need to do anything also Hallelujah praise Lord okay let's sing that Amazing Grace it's the amazing grace of God Amen we love him Amazing Grace thank you me singers [Music] like me [Music] I was alone but now I see oh Lord God I thank you for this evening Lord Jesus we are a very privileged people Lord God Lord that we can receive this message Lord Jesus Lord this is the only message that is full of grace and double Grace Lord God if if we can only believe Lord Jesus Hallelujah like like in that beyond the curtain of time that vision of your messenger Lord God praise the Lord like what he said Jesus will come and we'll judge him and if he pass all his people all his people will go in oh Lord I pray Lord Jesus bless the Ministers of in this church Lord the pastor Lord the associate Lord God the the brother that helping Lord Jesus is the ministry Lord God oh Lord Jesus O Lord I pray you bless each and every one O Lord God you know My Heart Lord God Lord I love this place I love this church Lord God not because of anything but because Lord I can fear the love Lord Jesus Lord bless each and everyone and all the family of God a new stem Lord Jesus as your channel of blessing Lord use their life use their life to their friend Lord God like what you said Lord if they will just only give them a cold glass of water lord in no other way Lord Jesus you will not forget it and you will reward their friend Lord Jesus their employer Lord God their employee Lord Jesus Hallelujah Lord God use our life Lord to be a Channel of blessing for more souls so that more soul will be saved we thank you Lord God we thank you this night this evening Lord God I give back all the glory to thy Praises in mighty name Lord Jesus Christ amen amen yes sir let's sing [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] to be free I'll pray there we are here [Applause] oh love me through Grace yes I want [Music] us [Music] together [Music] aren't you thankful for Grace remember we were stuck in condemnation by representation he freed us by representation tell you this was a this is a very strong sermon tonight strong meat many of these things I've studied many times in the scriptures and read there was many more quotes he could go into and I know many of the things he said to be true firsthand but what the prophet said amen but it's not something I would ever feel comfortable preaching myself so it's the grace of God and there's some things maybe we didn't understand there's always difficulty in expressing everything and finding every detail and balancing everything but the principle remains true study the message and study the scripture you'll find that the principle is true and if that principle be true then I ask you for your prayers that you would pray for me you'd pray for the other ministering brothers and the officers in the church because now we find that every gift and every position God will use it has something to it if if God gave gifts unto men and he sent a five full ministry for the perfecting of saints then that means we must have them must absolutely be there but oh how difficult it's going to be we need each other we need to pray for one another to say you pray for me and I'll pray for you I don't know how you felt during the sermon but I know how I felt I felt oh God you're going to have to help me I felt the weight of responsibility I felt the heaviness that comes with it and I feel it all the time and all I can say is would you pray for me and I certainly pray for you and will labor together and let God accomplish what he wants to accomplish in this day if we can just respect his way and respect and honor his word he'll take care of the rest no no people are perfect I'm not perfect you're not perfect we're here not perfect but if we can honor and respect God's way and honor and reverence his word and the way he set things up he'll take care of everything if we can just submit ourselves to him and trust him and put all of our trust in him and honor and respect him I've never seen it failed to honor God and respect him I've never seen him fail to keep his word everything brother Nester said it's far beyond human it's beyond the capabilities of human it has to be God it has to be God working or else we'll all find ourselves in trouble amen let's go from here prayerful and reverent our heads together let's give ourselves to God the heavenly father Lord you've given us strong meat tonight well but we see your word see what your Prophet told us Lord we know there's a truth here that we must honor in reverence help us father help us in all of our infirmities and all of our negative thinking all of our personalities God help us go beyond all of those things help us pass beyond our preferences and our likes and help us recognize your way God the way that you set things up the way you've designed them the way you've laid them in your word they are correct the way your Prophet taught it and laid it out it is correct Lord it is the only way sometimes it goes even against our preference or the personalities that we would prefer the way we would see something in ministered but God this is bigger than that this is bigger than all the the The Superficial elements of personal like and taste but God this is your ordination these are your gifts these are your placings these are your sheep lord it's all yours and help us to move Beyond these superficial carnal things help us to recognize your word in your way help us to submit and reverence ourselves to your way we're laying ourselves at your feet totally vulnerable to your word what can we do but obey your word what can we do but give reverence to your way and we make ourselves vulnerable Lord but we're trusting not in ourselves we're trusting in you to be our wall of protection if we stand behind your word your word will defend as your word will watch out for itself your word will manifest itself help us God to surrender to your way God help us as a body of Believers Lord to protect the home Church to respect and reverence one another and help one another to love one another God I prayed you bless every Ministry gift every officer in this place that we might administer the gift according to your way led by your spirit that we would reject all our own thinking and come your way Lord and I pray God that you would help me Lord you've placed me in this position and I surrender to it Lord but we need your help we need Supernatural guidance and Leadership we need your Holy Spirit to take control help me God I submit I surrender as we all do tonight but God we're asking you to come and do what humans can't do we're asking you to come and do more than we're able in ourselves as we surrender and submit we're asking you to come and do the supernatural you would perform the word perfectly according to the way you said it nor we love you we respect you and honor you Lord help us to honor you more God I pray you bless this people Lord that they would flourish Lord that they would Prosper that they would be in strength and health spiritually under the administration of your word through the gift that you've placed and God made the families grow and the husbands and the wives and the marriages and may the youth grow and come and find you in their own way and with a personal experience and may the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen find its Mark in everyone May there be new births May there be lies May there be salvation May there be grace and mercy all according to your way Lord as we surrender to that may there be health and strength in this home Church according to your word and by your grace we love you we thank you Father for the word we thank you for our brother Nestor we pray God that you would pour back into him all that he's given out of God that you would bless him and bless him and his service to his congregation God may you anoint him and Inspire him and strengthen him to play the role that you've called him to play in this end time God we love you we thank you bless him in his family as they travel watch over them and protect them and use them in every turn until they return safely back to their home Church we love you father and we ask that you would bless us now as we go May the things we've heard take root may your word take root in our hearts may your word manifest itself in our lives and may it accomplish what you
