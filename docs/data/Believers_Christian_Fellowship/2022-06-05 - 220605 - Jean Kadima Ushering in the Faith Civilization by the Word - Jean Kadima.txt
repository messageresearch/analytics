oh god you chose a man to preach the gospel that's why we can stand here with confidence that you will take over you will feed your children yourself you will break the bread of life the way only you know how to do it at the rest after the resurrection the disciples recognized you by the way you block the bread do it for us this morning because we are hungry and thirsty for the true word of god granted by your grace and mercy we commit ourselves to you in jesus christ's name amen amen thank you musicians you can take a seat for a while um thank you um i want to just give you a little uh update but a chad asked me to give an update to the church about the work that we've been doing in pittsburgh uh the church there it's called pittsburgh believers tabernacle many brothers from pittsburgh area and erie area they just got together and they say let's start something here and the brothers in erie have been very instrumental for that work and they invited me to join them and the response to the world has been very good amen so sometimes the word even discern uh the issues you know just like it does here the same word and sometimes it comes down in tears of denomination views and just like it does here you see sometimes god inspires but the chad and these guys becomes and just smudge everything and you see we go out like i've been spanked today you know spank but happy and that's what the word does over there too and and uh you see people asking me notes after the word has been really hitting hard so give us notes so he was he has been good seeing the response last week we even had a baptism a young man was baptized want some french books you can read english but you want books it doesn't want to go to the internet you want the real book like what a chat say so we're trying to find out those books i left some in boston and have to contact cloverdale to see if they can send him those so we start working with them around october 2001 2021 and in march around march i was thinking i say well it will be about six months i will know for sure what direction god wants me to go but just before we get to march they ask me can you continue coming every other week so i did not have my own direct direction so okay let's let's just do it so but around april um they of this year they asked me to be involved in all aspects of the church life so you know how to get a church service like we have now a lot of things are happening behind the scenes and that's they want me to be involved in all these things decision making and services and you know how many services a week should we continue renting here how much it costs can we rent somewhere else counseling all kind of things you know how so it's good um as the lord is leading when is in something is good okay no matter how sometimes it can be challenging but it's good every we we have to make decision with everything sunday school uh website audio visual you know all these things so sometimes uh josie and i come home at midnight after midnight but as long as the children of god are blessed is okay okay so that's what we want to be we want to do his perfect will my prayer if you can pray with me you your prayers have been very important and your support and continue praying i wish that they can grow god can increase them in numbers too so they can put church order and have a pastor because if they have a pastor then that pastor if he needs help then i can go and help it will be much easier so continue praying for me for that so that's all i can say because i'm slow i cannot take too much time i need all the time i need i can't have so maybe we should just stand up and go straight to the world the other day we were at brother ben's house having been the seaboard having the memorial picnic and fellowship the brother said to me this time say something like this time guest ministers will be preaching i say yes guest ministers we welcome them all but they will preach after me ok you see my comeback i have the last word all right let's go to uh the book of first corinthians this is a very ah has so many themes in this portion of scripture so i need you to put your filters and your spiritual jackets because i am just so adventuring taking so much liberty you need your jacket to be to fit you well so ah first corinthians chapter 15 4 we start with verse 22 for us in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the first fruit of the word the that our christ is coming then cometh the end when he shall have deliver up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for it shall reign till he had put all enemies under his feet oh my so many things here so let's just continue 26 uh the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he had put all things under his feet but when he say all things are put under him it is manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that pull all things under him that god may be all in all may god bless the reading of the word you may take your seats so greeting again in the name of the lord jesus christ good to be back in the house of the lord are you ready for the word amen so as you can see this uh subject is really loaded with a lot of ingredients so uh i'm going to be a little discipline so you can see here this portion of scripture scriptures uh we read is just fast forwarding everything to the end all right it's just goes back passing everything the body change the resurrection uh what is it the resurrection the the tribulation the millennium is fast forwarding and going to the end we have passed all the things the millennium the gog and magog whatever the earth purified everything then we can even see that the the bride the city is ready to come down and christ has finished his dispensation of redemption and he sit at the throne of god and say i done what you asked me to do and i'm speaking here as a three dimension people we see christ here we see the father here so christ comes to the end and say what you ask me to do i just accomplish it now i want to introduce a new civilization the civilization of faith now amen i've done what you asked me to do now everything is under defeat amen so this is uh it sounds like the future is far off when you read the scripture you say he's gonna put his last enemy death uh it is going to destroy it the enemies will be under the feet it's all sound very far and that's the danger right because before you say something is far away you have to know where you are you cannot just say it's far in time where you are in time amen so that's where we we we're gonna go and just make sure that we don't put things so far away uh they may be happening amen wow so he is what does he do he has shown people the children of god who god is because that the work of christ the anointing word christ is showing to the humanity who is the invisible god that is love is life is all this attributes that you know now that is finishing revealing god's plan and what god is now is going to introduce and is going the bible even say that is going to submit himself to god right and then the fullness of the submission the fullness of submission is when you don't have your mind of your own the fullness of submission is you don't have your own desire him and she are the same because she has his mind and that's why the bible the prophet can say that she hears him because he's a fully totally submissive and when we say christ will be now submissive to god it just mean it goes back to where it was before you get that uh spiritual english he goes back and blend back again as it says in the beginning was the word the word the word was with god the word was god so it's back to where he used to be amen amen praise god let's look at christ brother branham in this message christ um christ is the mystery of god reveal he say now i'm going to give you a little secret till i meet you again remember this as we stand remember this and they start singing at the name of jesus by we said well he just said that i'm gonna give you a little secret right so let's hold him to that as he's singing at the name of jesus bowie i keep singing oh sweet the hope of glory and then what he start giving the secret oh sing again the hope of glory the hope the hope of the earth and joy of heaven and he say everything is manifested in christ god the church everything else is manifest in christ the bible is christ the bible is the written word which is the world its manifestation is the evidence of the life coming into the flesh of the world to manifest it oh it's not wonderful now brother is almost speaking in tongues here so everything that you need everything when you say joy you're talking about christ when you say life you're talking about christ when you talking about anything peace all these things you talking about christ that's why you see the world say i want to make there are so many organizations that want to make the world a better place what they're talking about is christ but they don't want that they want to make the world a better place without christ without the atonement but why do they want to improve things but i'm saying it is because they are sons of god the fallen sons of god but what they're talking about is everything is christ because is the manifestation of the invisible god and that's the little secret that everything is hidden in christ and he is the anointed word of god life salvation redemption everything is in christ is that a secret and christ has been operating from the beginning and now the fullness of christ in human bodies have been manifested and that's a secret a secret coming amen now let's continue paragraph 4 58 notice then so what we looking at here is christ has manifested the secret that was in god's mind he has shown to the humanity who god is how what is his plan what is the purpose that was in his mind he has revealed it to us now now we are at the end now he has to introduce a new a new civilization right there now what does he say we can see here he say that notice then one left the first adam and eve before sin separate them in death now christ the second adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original eden restoring back his bride in fellowship back with god as a husband and wife in the garden of eden christ and his bride so this is we really have fast forwarded to the end now christ has done the work the dispensation of redemption is over now he is now back to where he is supposed to be god is plan is where is supposed to be and now christ the second adam is redeem his bride and go sit with the bride and now back to the garden of eden again god now let's see when you look at the uh projection there you see that god is the husband with the wife is it god or is it christ are you with me now christ because the plan of god has always been adam and eve in the garden of eden right so now who is sitting there with the bride is that the christ or it is god is it god the husband or christ the husband god is all in all at this point because everything the redemption period is over now he's taking his place the way god had it in his mind but he needed the function the attribute the manifestation of christ to fulfill it now he fulfill it now now the prophet is talking now is he talking about the husband is he talking about god as if a attribute or is he talking about christ as the attribute are you with me now it's all in all we're back in the blending time amen amen praise god now let's go continue and god and that day the kingdom be given over to the father he will be all in all was it in christ or is it a god i'm talking like kind of a trinitarian to confuse somebody who just pick up something from the message i'm just going like i'm a trinitarian now but that's the way we understand things because we look at things in three dimension so we see god here we see christ here you know so but here i'm just telling you that we are in a different civilization what god had in his mind now is fulfilled he wanted his son and his daughter his son and his wife on the throne now he got it god at that day the kingdom be over to the father he will be all in all while he's yet speaking i will hear now he's talking about that civilization of faith when you you say david christ dave is sitting on the throne the king of the whole human race and why they are yet thinking i will know what they are thinking about before they speak i will answer what a civilization have you noticed that it is not this the civilization of the son of david because the son of david is in the millennium you see is a civilization of david himself christ sitting on the throne and this will be a faith civilization where when you just thinking it i want to have a breakfast with bread and soul and so we got breakfast all of my my eggs are made exactly the way i like them and the coffee and and espresso the roof and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like a bullock they shall feed together and lay down they shall no hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain right back exactly to eden again as hard as he can i can go now the problem is oh that world that civilization is coming but the problem is the prophet told us that he warned us he said this he said man always praise god for what he did and over and over the prophet tells us that he said they they look forward to what is going to there but they ignore what he's doing and we put everything far fetched if our fart away in in the future is it true because as i said you have to know where you are in time so you can say it is far away we we are waiting for it but let me already tell you that it is here amen is here with us because the word the word remember it will be a civilization of faith by the world and the world has been opened today so we have one foot in one foot in that civilization amen that's true i was i had all kind of uh i had different uh titles to my message this morning and i was just waiting god what title because i don't know about other preachers if i don't have it i'm always all over the place okay if i don't have a title i don't i don't know how to focus so i am there and i'm listening to what a child is preaching on wednesday he say i'm ready for the millennium okay all right and you say that i have one foot out already that's it ushering of the faith aftering of the faith civilization by the word because when you have a foot out it means the other foot is not yet so you are in between so the blending of eternity and time amen and that's what we're talking about because of the opening of the seven seals christ himself has to come he is the one who introduced the faith civilization christ himself is the heat did he come did he open the seals therefore the eternity and time are blended together we are just in the ushering amen you know what this ushering the wedding is about to happen it's ushering why is it the wedding yes it's a wedding you may say he's not waiting because the pastor has not said you know you know you married is that right but he said ushering it means we are in that process amen and that's where we are then we cannot put it far away and say it's going to happen because there is a danger someone will say it happened already and you did not know it amen let's look at it the seventh seal everything runs out in this time the end the end of the seventh seal notice is the end of the church age is the end of the seventh seal it's the end of the trumpet it's the end of the vials the end oh and the ushering in the millennium that's on the seventh seal amen paradox the paradox as we realize that we we are closing the time time is running out it's blending in with eternity eternity is that special civilization there's civilization by faith where you say the word something happened and we are at the west coast as uh civilization has traveled is to the west so as the gospel travel with it and now there is no place to go back but to go but back east again it's completed amen ushering in of this faith civilization are you already already there amen amen amen amen amen romans chapter 8 17 it says that if children their ears ears of god and joint heir with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us oh it could be the glory that will be revealed to us in that civilization that god has so many things that he cannot tell us as we're living in this uh flesh in this dimension that he has a lot but just just remember the glory has also been revealed to us today right now it has the same impact it has something that is taking place it we cannot wait everything to happen at the end it's just like that person who goes into that banquet or that uh supper without the clothes why are you here without the clothes why are you with your denominational mind anyway it's that now it's ushering in that time but you gotta be in the process not wait sometimes someday something will happen do you believe that amen so when god is going to show us that that new civilization what are we going to do are we going to ask him lord how did you create the world um how everything is linked together how all this universe was built no the prophet is telling us maybe we will do that some of us are curious they have a curious mind want to know more but the prophet said that it is an innocence civilization like a children like adam we will just speak and it will happen amen we will we need do we need that do we need to know as the pastor was preaching wednesday do we need to know everything all the details we don't need it all we need to know that the world has the power of transformation the world has a power to create to call into existence amen that's what i will need to know that i'm a creator right now i want to create a good atmosphere around me so people can feel the presence of christ in my life i am a creator now not in the next civilization right now the world does that amen amen set an eden um this is a great time everybody has got money everybody can do this and everybody can do that and money flowing everywhere and big cars and everything there won't be one of them in that city no cars okay there won't be a one car one plane no it's all be to be all to get a different civilization it will be again a civilization not of knowledge not of science but of innocence a faith in the living god probably i will not ask him the mechanism of everything how the dna all right because it will be innocence just pick the thing happen i don't care about how they all link together right because that is the civilization of today where they want to know the mechanism and what they do is they try to do a reverse engineering that they go from a product they create another product based on that product by looking how it is done but that's not our civilization we go by the word and get the result amen but this engineer reverse engineering is just like two people go and eat a good meal have a good dish and they go back they they start figuring out how it was made i think i tasted some tomato there some parmesan no no it was it was swiss cheese they go back there why don't you just go ask for the recipe okay well you can still eat something you can still make up something and eat and although the kids will say ah man it was egg so but you can eat it why don't you just go ask the owner he conceived it he thought about it and then made it why don't you go and ask for some reason they don't want they want to reverse engineering but if it's a recipe is okay but what about is about your life don't you want to go and ask the one who conceived it so the civilization of innocence is good we know everything we know all things but we don't know everything and we don't care about it because we can just speak and it will appear i don't know what is the mechanism that's what faith does yes power of transformation so god is great one great kingdom that is to come we will have a civilization but it's not be anything like this it won't be by science it will be a faith civilization by the world the science civilization we have is exactly satan trapped that's what he has killed the people with it that's what is killing us every day with it they tried to play god in their lads no wonder the prophets saw them trying to uh to mix up things say to them stop that stop that and they did not want to maybe they were like brother abraham was saying they were checking the message and criticizing it watch man what of the day the night oh my friend listen to us thus saith the lord if you consider me to be a servant it's just before the break of day what uh that is why this horrible gloom is over the earth it's just before the coming of the lord jesus there is no more hope let left in nothing but is coming [Music] nations are against nations and they have a full through god's laboratory till they got the power to blow one another into atomic ashes and they are wicked and they are and religious and they are on la and christian like and the only mod if they have an object is to destroy they they are inspired by the destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire this man i want the original and this morning i want you to to to be glad that god gave you the original that will can create that can change things it can provide joy peace and everything without the reverse engineering you have the recipe it is the word of god rejoice for it no matter what the devil says rejoice for it you have the original all you need is to give it water amen to give it light to plant it in a good atmosphere amen but it's going to reproduce according to his own kind the kind of god what god is is what that seed gene is in you amen it doesn't need to to manufacture anything it is there give it the word continue obeying to the word amen so brother bernham keep talking about this people science has brought into god the great laboratory until they're going to destroy themselves maybe with their biological weapon but i i i'm talking about this so you can see that this civilization is a fumbling in god a great laboratory and they trying to do things in reverse but you have everything that created heaven and earth in you yet the devil tells you how miserable you are i feel sorry about yourself but you have all this power in you that need to be unleashed it is dormant it got to be unleashed just keep watering it amen because we don't need we don't need to know the mechanism because the bible says hebrews 11 3 through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so we cannot start manufacturing it reverse engineering it no that's why they fail now the man is killing man amen and what happened to scientific world happened to the denominational world same thing same concept they went fumbling in god lab they almost break in god's lab to see how can we clone this but abandonment was not against researching for a cancer care cure for example he never it did not say that but what they doing if the prophet saw them and told them to stop it must be bad amen but what they did is exactly what the nomination or system has done so you can be glad and rejoice and praise god for having the original they did what science did they did what is done in the physical world what they did is they try also to fumble in god word to figure out things amen the prophet says here in spiritual food in due season then back out there uh at the beginning of the seven season when those seven angels come down in that pyramid form stood there and told me to return back here and speak on those seven seals and he would be with me he would show me what they were the lost things i always thought it was a seal on the back of the book and it will be something that was not written in the book but it turned out that it was made known that it cannot do that is not something that is written in the book it's something that's been hid in the book for whosoever shall take one word from it and add one word to it so it's it's a mystery that's been in the book in this seven church ages each one of them produce a mystery and all about water baptism and this other things that they've fumbled about so long oh they fumble reverse engineering things trying here trying there sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work the baptist fumbled and found that yeah you you need the baptism in the water but they keep using the title yeah the jesus only say no it must be jesus but they use jesus as one god as one unit they're kind of close breaking in god lab yeah it kind of works it doesn't work you gotta go to the the one who conceived the idea the one who had a thought in his mind amen the prophet says here in the breach he say that it's hid now remember no man in heaven no man in earth pope bishop cardinal state presbyter and whosoever whoever he is can break them sees and reveal the book but the land and we have probed this we is not a royal we because the prophet did not do that are you with me the prophet did not do that when he probes god comes revealed to him because the word of god is revealed to the prophet and we have probed and presumed stumble the wonder that the reason we are in such a confusion man message believers we cannot continue this way we have the original let water the original let us use the original let stay with the original it shall reproduce according to god law of reproduction amen amen if it is god's word it shall reproduce god in you amen there is no question about it amen but if we stumble we try here we try there we keep our denominator system mentality then it is hybridization it will not reproduce thank god i'm speaking to an audience that knows him in the truth in the spirit amen now as i'm talking about this let me take some more liberty here and read this first corinthians 10 11. now all these things happen unto them for examples they are written for admonition upon whom the end of the world are calm and sometimes i i uh i need just to be careful that anything that i say will not be constructed as criticism or success or putting somebody down or but the bible say if there is something in the message there it was written for us so we can learn from it amen we who have come to the ends we have arrived to the end in our time no more shadow no more type everything is a reality there is no other group other people that will use us as a type everything has come to the end therefore whatever happened in brother branham's life can be used for our instruction that's what i want i want to show you how how uh the the denomination miss missed to see the origin and they went fondly finding something else but for you and i let it be an encouragement that what you have received is the truth and it shall reproduce according to his own kind amen i don't want just to wait for that civilization to come i want it now amen i want it now i want to create i am a creator you are too i want to create a good atmosphere around me that's something i need there are so many things in our life that will help us to display christ better i want it now that civilization will come but i am already in it i am it is ushering of that civilization right now amen is your life worthy of the gospel and i say this is about brother uh tommy osborne remember brother branham talks so many good things about tommy you know that all over the message you just hear about him and how he brother branham really love him really love him and he also say good things about brother branham choose but that's something something there there's something that just sharing with you there and you say i say come out of him satan he just fell backward and pinned my feet right on to the floor he's talking about the maniac of oregon now he said uh god is god a good god brother branham that's all say i've made myself nail in the house for two or three days that's better tommy osborne i don't pull no pantries he will tell he will tell about it he's not the shame of it say you think i got a gift of healing i say forget it tommy you were sent to preach the gospel go preach it go with by the both wolves there so many times brother brennan when he talks about this story about tommy osborne is always he talk about the maniac of oregon but when you hear brother tommy osborne himself talking about it he say when he saw brother branham holding a girl a little girl and say you demon or spirit of dumb and you spirit of the the the kid could not speak so he he rebuked that spirit with a soft uh voice and just speak to it come out of this girl without any noise that spirit came out and brother tommy osborne was like oh i need the same thing so he went and locked himself in the room for three days and after that he went and did the same thing and the miracles have started happening and he went back to brother branham and says brother branham do you think i have a gift of healing listen to the prophet he said forget about it if i go to the prophet and i'm so excited that god did something to me or for me and he said to me forget about it should not i forget about it i should forget about it but he did not jesus sent me yesterday today and forever i have a little uh friend a little pentecostal brother was one of the my converts to divine healing was tommy osborne i don't know whether you ever known him or not very lovely fine brother if he ever comes through this country but put your arms around him and hug him for me he's really a wonderful little brother and many other other my brothers too all of them are but i mean just speaking of tommy when he come to me he was a little nervous like a fellow he was a very nice person he probably is i don't know if he's alive or what he has a family as children grandchildren is wonderful but this is for our example this is to teach us something you know when he sold the products he wants to replicate the product but you gotta go to the original to where it was conceived are you with me and sometimes we still see the same thing let's go to the world and the rest will follow let's start with the word and the rest will be given to us as god himself decide to give to us then he will give it to us [Music] he started he ran around his car two or three times just after this port portland meeting up here he's seen that maniac being taken down by the power of god and he said oh he said brother branham you think i got a gift of healing i say tommy honey don't think about that see i say you know you are a preacher yes i say you know what you know the word of god will defeat satan anywhere any place any time any on any condition that's right the word of god that's right well brother barajan but god told buddha branham to bring this gift of healing to to the people of the world yes but how he preached the word then the miracles happened amen amen they will not read the message you and i will read the message the message community will read the message we listen to the tapes so these things are for us for example that if you plan the word stay with the world you will never regret that decision the commission of god was we said first the commission was the healing the discernment the gift but that's i can beg to defer a little bit because the first commission was in 1933 on the ohio river as john the baptist was sent that was the commission and if you are a minister you are entitled to pray for the sick but start with the word plant the seed the word then god is obligated to do whatever you want to do whatever you want you to manifest it will manifest it but start with the word not with the gift don't reverse engineering it amen so i encourage you start with the word continue power god's power to transform and every and every everything under control to bring forth of its kind what kind kind of the word if you have the word then god will decide what he is going to give to you but start with the word simple message you turn out for the audience it's like a choir amen do you agree with me now remember to bring when he put the seed the seed in the earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant and whatever it was is transforming power now god now god put the seed in there with potential that it will be what he say it will be start with the world and as long as it stay in this right category it will be just exactly what god said it will be it had to be what that way because he had made it that way and made a channel amen that any uh that let's continue that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word say it will do it cannot move from there it channeled just exactly right so with everything in the trust in his own son that it would be that way then god say it's all good so i will just rest and each one of those seed has power in itself to transform itself into the species and i desire it to be that's what it must be because i've given every seed transforming power to make out of itself and its potential now to make out of itself exactly what i want it to be don't you just want it to be what god want is yes i want this gift that the prophet has start with the word the prophet says you want a church start with the word amen hallelujah so this is an encouragement awfully for all of us that an encouragement that tells us that let's start with that seed is planted does he have water the water of the washing of the wood let's make sure that the water comes well the water comes it's being absorbed right and how is it absorbed because we obey to the word and then yes you have received the word yes then you have water it yes does he have light are you feeling are you giving it light what is the light the word the anointed word of your time amen it does is already fertilized it doesn't need really fertilizer it doesn't need a repellent because you are made to repel all these false doctrine and things away from you all this unbelief away from you let's just make sure it doesn't hurt to go to the lord and say am i in the faith because there is a civilization that is coming is the civilization of faith am i in a faith do am i do i obey your word and that's not an effort that's just absorbing it and say yes lord i believe it amen and if that happened if that happened something will take place whatever god wants to take place we will still be living in this sticky nature that we have but something there inside will continue taking place i remember brother branham crossing that place where there was a ball he is and that story about the ball i did not hear brother banam say this is a ministry this is just for a prophet this will happen only uh for the prophet he never say that it must be for all of us amen and that's what i want not to perform necessary miracle but the control of situations is god in you how many situations we come across how many times i felt like i failed but christ control situations christ and me should control even in this sticky nature fallen nature is still have the power to control situations amen amen he is telling that story and then when i started across the field right out in the big open field and not over about 30 yards from me this big fellow raised up and threw his horns down and let out a big bellow and if you know what i'm talking about there he was horns about like this and here he come at first it scared me i look for a tree then there was no any three i looked it could uh oh oh around me to the fence and i thought well this is it so then something happened amen i wanna i i wanna we know this story we read it we listen to it over and over and over again right but let me just uh you know stress something here when buddha balaam saw this ball he knew the danger it was not reckless it was not like i am the prophet of god and nothing will happen to me no he act just the way you and i will act in face of danger the first thing he did was to try to find his gun right maybe the second thing was when he found that he left his gun in the truck so oh because he was thinking i'm gonna kill it and then i'm gonna pay the owner just like you and i living a normal life and then when he saw that they the gun was not there he looked at the fence the fence was far off so i cannot go there he looked there was no tree for so he can climb are you even then he did not know what else to do then he just say i don't want to be i don't want to die like a coward i'm not going to cry so he just did everything like you and i and then he says something happened i want that something amen because it's the same word he has the same he believed the same word he wanted the same word and he said something happened if you ask me that something happened did not come from outside that something was already inside he did not know he was dormant in him he just used his human mind just you like you and i amen what he did i will tell you you want to clam up a tree of knowledge that's what he did the dangers coming are gone tree of knowledge a tree tree of knowledge a fast tree of knowledge then he found that it doesn't work then god came on the scene but i would not say he was outside something within himself that seed gene that you have been watering was dormant in the right time it came to manifestation amen something happened i want that and he could speak now to the ball and say oh i am a servant of god adam restore eve restore on earth eve did not fear anymore in that civilization you won't fear anymore is that right but don't put it far away because it happened to brother branham here he did not fear it was not way in the future it was right here it did not manufacture it it happened like naturally that's what i needed that's what i'm asking that's what i'm watering the world so that it can whatever god want because in my life i've seen a lot of bulls ferocious bulls did not you is that am i alone and they come you see they're coming and you can discern them you can see them coming you can discern what they're going to do they're coming like a hurricane maybe they will come in your personal life maybe they're coming to attack your family and you are there you don't know what to do amen will not be good that god takes over because you can discern it you can say it is this the purpose is to do this it's like a hurricane he's going to take everything is that right but you deserve it but what can you do about it is not you who have to do is god if he wants me to go through this hurricane i will go through it amen if you want to stop it he will stop it amen what is happening is christ in you will act and control the situation when you need it amen i don't know how to say it in the way of uh learned educated uh but in a terminology but i'm not speaking to intellect i'm speaking to the soul christ the word is speaking to the soul you grab you understand what i'm talking about amen amen it is not about theology it's the word of god and god i felt so many times yes i'm still living in this nature yes i will do like by the branham but do you remember when god came on the scene a jump from the tree of knowledge to the tree of life right there the gun is not working the fence is not working then he jump on the tree of life he he did not care about what is happening he has no fear god took over oh god if that could only stay there instead of going away something happened i wish god will let it happen to everybody here tonight just long enough to get here something happened i wasn't scared of the bull i felt sorry because i disturbed him i was in his field he was laying out there not bothering me i come along and walk him or came up and so i i felt sorry for him now you can't bluff it it has to be there where there that's the way faith is you can't bluff it you've got to really have it sometimes you can discern it because the prophet says when when that bull comes in your life you can discern it because you are a child of god and the prophet says that our eternal destiny is depend on our discernment we do about what we see and what we hear we can discern it but it takes god to come on the scene and i don't see where brother but i'm saying the word of god says in the face of danger you have to do this no it came naturally sometimes the bulls can be somebody who's really angry at you oh what can you do well but ibn something came on the scene he look and say i am a son of adam restore i know adam gave you a name you are a boy he gave you a name and he gave you a place he replaces you he just did not just give you a name but he called you when god gave you a name he placed you somewhere like the patriarch the women of jacob they call the children name and they place them in their property and god gave you the bull he gave you your territory he gave you turf i disturb it but i'm a son of god i will i i need to respect your environment your turf i made a mistake forgive me i'm a servant of god oh god oh back to that civilization again back to the civilization amen i want that i i just want that so because it will come this vicious bulls will come but we have to have that security in christ amen and it has to become a natural it's not like they come they attack you maybe it's a colleague maybe it's him you lucky if i was not a christian you're lucky no no i want it to be natural i forgive you i understand you feel insecure you feel like i'm being promoted you feel like violated you feel like this and that i understand i'm a child of prosperity if i'm in this company god blesses this company i'm not here to take your place because i own everything hallelujah ah praise god and we pray that you will honor tonight your servant and the prayer that we make to you the songs that we sing and bless the word lord and as it goes forth made to really fall on fertile ground right at this our lord we pray that you will pull out every greenbriar every root of bitterness and all this belief from the heart of your people that the world might fall on good rich fertilized soil that will bring forth great results to these people that's the origin the original that the thing so just make sure is there any bitterness the word cannot grow under that atmosphere that circumstance remove that bitterness the prophet say go to your knees until the bitterness is gone oh man that disbelief satan i don't believe what you say i stay with the word of god if even if i don't understand it i stay with it the soil fertilized good and rich it is good and rich the soil is good and rich that's why god came and planted a seed now all we need is just to give it more room or water just keep doing it in the time that god decided to use it don't he should have the liberty to do it you see he's a gentleman the holy ghost is a gentleman he doesn't force himself in us is that right he doesn't force himself in us he's waiting for us therefore if i go to him and say lord am i pleasing you that's the word find the room in man it's not something wrong it's not an effort it's not like i'm trying to do it it is i want to be sure and he loved that time of fellowship with him when you ask him i just want to please you father that's the word find a place is there any portion that i don't oh play because i want when the time comes i want you to do what you want to do in man when the time of test came when brother branham was told to curse those kids that were kissing in the church making fun of the word god control the situation in him i want to pass that type of test i need to pass the test where i know the time to speak out and the time to keep silence is that what the word say ecclesiastes 3 a time to rend a time to sow a time to keep silence and the time to speak i want that control of the situation every many times i fell but if christ isn't me the world i wanted to be able to take over and stop me from speaking and saying anything for that situation because the test is not to say anything but the test can be also you have to speak up now if you don't speak out you have just compromised i need it to be him not me i know i don't need it to be for vain glory but for his glory are you with me church amen amen yet i'm still living in this nature but yet i'm victorious now the power of the enemy under our feet now not in the future anyway christ does not have feet he has your feet therefore the power of the enemy are under your feet because he is the head and you are the body matthew 10 19 but when they deliver you up take no thought on how what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in the same hour that it shall speak that's what i want amen knowing that you're a child of god you are in your line of duty oh but christ can do what he some people want him to do this specific they want him to do the healing of the body right now to give us this gift that gift but what if is not what he wants to do right now i want him to do what he wants to do right now in me i don't want it to stop him for nothing that's a good desire amen the church is the church of the living god so that the way you do the word of god accept it in your good heart already fertilized and all the creepers and the rocky places and the stony out taken away and in a good rich soil of faith believe it commit it to god and walk away testifying that you have received what god has promised you he is the high priest of your confession to make right anything that you confess that he has done that the gospel now the gospel is not only inward it is in a power you planted that power will be in you but we need to start by the word amen now the bible is a different book from any other sacred book there is no book like the bible because the bible is god in word form see a word is a thought expressed god thinking expressed it is word through the prophet they wrote the bible which is the in word form and jesus call it a seed and any seed will bring forth is its kind if it's in the right condition the right atmosphere don't you just want to have the right condition right atmosphere he say that word is the fate expressed but if some something can tear away them weeds if god by his grace not the preacher not nobody else god by his grace can tear that those weeds remove them give the world the place to breathe to grow and one one when god need it he will reproduce he will do something that god wants to do i don't want to hold him back amen he's saying talking apply it apply the torque and create that atmosphere around you that they will just drop right into it into it see you are you are you you uh if you got the token you create a spirit around you a power then when you walk people know that you are christian they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they're all onto it they believe your word huh is it the word of god or your word your word and god's word becomes one it did not just happen for elijah when he said by my word there will be no rain no do until i say so amen let god say the word is now your word amen apply that atmosphere is that right god's words will reproduce according to his own kind do you believe that now we cannot we have been ushered into that civilization now because the fullness of the world is now the faith of god not my faith people's faith but god's faith that's why god told brother branham when he was criticized that they say oral roberts is praying for 50 people you just pray for five people it looks like verb went into the desert to pray why am i like this but god said to him these people they preach by their understanding of the bible they do what they do by their own faith but you it is god sending it to you the original you want the original start with the word amen start with the word apply the atmosphere apply the word yeah plant let it receive the water and the light that they need the atmosphere it needs it's going to reproduce that civilization we have just ushered into it amen because before the physical before the physical there is a spiritual it's always like that jesus before he goes to calvary he wasn't getting money you can say calvary was important and that's true it was critical it was the end of everything but everything actually uh happened it gets money this is where he saw the movie of going to calvary he saw the rejection there he has to make the decision without getting money calvary would not have spent happened without getting money there will be no calvary because this is where he had to make a decision to go through and when he made the decision he saw before he made the decision he saw the movie of what will happen if he does not go how many will be lost if he doesn't go he made that decision then get some money happen for calvary to happen when everything was happening in calvary for him it was just deja vu all over again like you say using bad french but the spiritual precede the physical amen you cannot go there and have that supper without the dressing robe now amen and the prophet say god let me dress her with the robe now that cause for the next civilization it happened now the spiritual is happening now are you looking forward to the next civilization i want to be there but it start now is already there because eternity and time are blending together amen and there's the word the fullness of the word christ is here in his people therefore that civilization has been ashered in amen amen the challenge well i've been very good musician you can come the challenge the challenge that we have a challenge we do have a challenge we do have a challenge and god expect us god expects us to take on that challenge amen you see when the lord you can have all the notes possible but but guess what god will only talk about what you want to talk about amen praise god amen the challenge god wants one man one man just one man i will read it here you can take off the projector i'm just going to read it from the book there's a challenge you can all stand up we almost done the challenge for us is god is looking for one man one person one man one woman who can take him by his word and obey the word just one not many we are many but this is an individual walk is that right that's the challenge we have what is the challenge it is you say in the once once more he say if god can only find one man that's all he needs one man that can fully surrender to him he don't take an army he never did use that he only uses one man amen you say again in the same message you say that now as a gift now i'm going to tell you a secret as i live you've been sweet and kind so uh where you i never exactly expressed this i know of the public before brother branham what is that gift it's a gift of knowing how to get william branham out of the way so jesus christ can live through a vessel just getting yourself out of the way you know when people asking for gifts why don't you also ask for a gift say god i want a gift too and that gift is to get out of your way you can do what you want to do that's my desire is that your desire praise god amen may god bless you brother ben can you help me [Music] are my strength when i am weak you are the treasure that i see you're my [Music] i want the holy ghost [Music] jesus lamb
