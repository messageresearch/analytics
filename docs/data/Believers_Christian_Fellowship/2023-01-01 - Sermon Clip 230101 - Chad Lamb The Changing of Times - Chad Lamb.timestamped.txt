[0:00] and modern events May clear by prophecy
[0:02] he says what time is it that we're
[0:03] living in something like a calendar you
[0:06] look at the calendar to find out what
[0:07] day of the year you're living in and you
[0:09] look at God's Bible to see what age
[0:11] we're living in we're not living in the
[0:13] Methodist days the Baptist age we're
[0:15] living in the bright Age The Calling
[0:17] bringing back to God through a channel
[0:19] that he promised to bring it back and he
[0:22] promised to do it
[0:23] amen we've heard these things so many
[0:26] times but we don't want them to become
[0:27] so common that it's no longer exciting
[0:30] that God has turned the page because
[0:31] we're not in church ages anymore this is
[0:34] the bride age amen he says this is the
[0:36] end he said the messenger must come at
[0:38] the end of the age he comes at the end
[0:40] of the Pentecostal age and brother bear
[0:42] said the Pentecostal age is the old
[0:44] laodicean churches
[0:46] so at the end he doesn't come at the
[0:49] beginning he comes at the end what's he
[0:51] doing he's marking out a closing of
[0:53] something and Bridging the way through a
[0:55] gap into something else what's he
[0:57] bridging his way into to the bright age
[1:00] amen and the bride age is not another
[1:02] church age
[1:05] think about this it's not another church
[1:07] age amen sometimes people fight the
[1:10] terminology Brides They want to fight
[1:12] that because they say you're adding
[1:13] another church age it's not a church age
[1:15] it's a bride Age The Very term indicates
[1:19] it cannot be an additional Church age
[1:22] because it is a bride age not a church
[1:25] age
[1:26] not an eighth Church age called breath
[1:28] no it's a bride age it's something
[1:30] completely different than the church
[1:32] ages
[1:33] you had Church ages you had first church
[1:36] age second Church age you had uh
[1:38] laodicean Church we're not talking about
[1:41] church ages anymore there's been a
[1:43] breach Amen to get us from here to get
[1:45] to somewhere else and there's somebody
[1:47] standing in the gap of the breach
[1:48] indicating a change in time to take us
[1:51] out of church ages into bright age not
[1:55] an additional age
[1:58] good morning amen because there's there
[2:01] is no argument here there is no eighth
[2:04] messenger eighth there's no eighth
[2:07] Church age amen that brother bam said
[2:09] there is no Eighth Day it goes back to
[2:11] the first day amen so what is this
[2:14] addition what what comes at the end of
[2:17] the seven Church ages there is an age
[2:19] open amen it's not a new age it's
[2:22] actually an old age
[2:24] [Music]
[2:26] it's not a new age amen it's an eternal
[2:30] age amen it's not marked by time it is a
[2:33] position it's what the church was
[2:35] intended to be when it was birthed at
[2:37] Pentecost but it fell into the church
[2:40] ages and now coming out of the church
[2:42] age there's got to be another indication
[2:44] of a change in time and in every Church
[2:47] age God indicated the change in time
[2:49] with a messenger to come move from one
[2:52] to the other but in this layer of the
[2:54] cnh he was going to bring one at the end
[2:56] of the Pentecostal age
[2:59] to move us out of the church age into
[3:02] the bride age amen which is going right
[3:05] back to what the bride was intended to
[3:07] be at her very birth at Pentecost
