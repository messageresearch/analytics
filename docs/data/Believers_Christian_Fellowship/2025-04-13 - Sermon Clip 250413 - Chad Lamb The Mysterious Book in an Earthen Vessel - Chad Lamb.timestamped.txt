[0:00] This mystery is God made flesh. So Jesus
[0:04] Christ is God made flesh. That's why the
[0:06] book is in him. Not something inside of
[0:08] him. But he is the manifestation of the
[0:13] contents of the book. The word made
[0:15] flesh.
[0:19] So then no man can touch this book. No
[0:24] man can look upon the book because it's
[0:26] sealed. No
[0:27] man, only the worthy one. And Christ
[0:30] steps forward because he paid the price
[0:31] of redemption for this book. Now he's
[0:32] going to lay claim to the book. And now
[0:34] he takes and he opens the seals of the
[0:36] book. And he comes down as the mighty
[0:37] angel in Revelation chapter 10. Now he's
[0:39] got an open book in his hand.
[0:42] Not a sealed book anymore. Now the
[0:44] mysteryy's been unveiled. Now it's open.
[0:47] Now a voice now comes to John, which
[0:50] John's a type of the bride. And a voice
[0:51] comes to John and says,
[0:53] "Go to the angel and take the book.
[1:01] Take
[1:05] it. Take it and eat it up.
[1:09] Amen. This is the book nobody could
[1:12] touch. Nobody could look at. Nobody
[1:15] could read. This was the book that Adam
[1:18] lost. No man could have it. This is the
[1:20] one that's been hiding in the flesh of
[1:22] Jesus Christ for safekeeping. And now at
[1:25] the opening of the seals under a seventh
[1:27] church age messenger, when the mystery
[1:29] of God's finished, now the seals have
[1:31] come off the book. Now the book has come
[1:33] back to earth.
[1:36] Where does the mighty angel put his
[1:38] feet?
[1:42] Brother Brandham said the seventh angels
[1:43] on earth at the time of this coming.
[1:46] He came and brought what did he bring
[1:48] back? He didn't bring back a piece of
[1:51] paper, friends. Amen. But he come back
[1:54] and he's told to take the
[1:57] book and eat it up. Amen.
[2:03] Do you see how complicated the book of
[2:05] Revelation is? If we're looking for some
[2:07] physical thing in a physical location,
[2:09] because we're looking for a physical
[2:10] thing, if we're looking for a list of
[2:12] names that are wrote down and and then
[2:14] on the day of judgment, Brother Benham
[2:16] said at the white throne judgment, that
[2:17] book will be opened and the names will
[2:18] read off. How's he going to open the
[2:20] book and read the names? John ate it.
[2:24] Where's the book? The Bible says John to
[2:28] took the book and he ate it up and in
[2:30] his in his mouth it was sweet as honey,
[2:32] but in his belly it was bitter. Amen.
[2:34] How is God going to take that same book
[2:37] and open it at the white throne judgment
[2:39] and start reading all the names of it?
[2:41] Check Bob. Check Susie. Check Harry.
[2:45] Check.
[2:47] Where's the book? The book was inside.
[2:50] Amen. God made flesh in Jesus Christ.
[2:52] Now, at the opening of the seals, he
[2:54] comes to John and represents the church
[2:56] and says, "Now I'm going to take the
[2:58] book back to earth and I'm going to put
[2:59] the book in another earthn vessel." And
[3:02] that other vessel is my many membered
[3:04] body, my bride. And now the book is
[3:07] secure in the bride. What is that book?
[3:10] It's the mystery of God that was in the
[3:12] back part of his mind. what God wanted
[3:14] to achieve in all the Bible that he
[3:17] wanted to become a family on the earth
[3:19] and fellowship together in harmony and
[3:21] in love and in fellowship.
[3:24] And now that book with all the names and
[3:27] all the contents and everything else is
[3:29] in a many member body.
