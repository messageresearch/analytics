[5:38] weather
[5:39] but praise god we've got a company of
[5:42] angels
[5:43] that accompany us amen let's take our
[5:46] bibles and turn to isaiah 60. we're
[5:48] going to read those two scriptures that
[5:50] brother
[5:50] branham reads at the beginning of this
[5:52] book to refresh in our minds the way he
[5:55] started the
[5:56] message here in shalom i also would like
[5:59] to announce at the end of service
[6:02] young natalie wholesale would like to be
[6:03] baptized tonight
[6:05] so i told her this is a memorable night
[6:08] you'll never forget
[6:09] getting baptized in a snowstorm and i
[6:12] said just don't tell people that the
[6:13] water was heated you know
[6:14] just tell him you were baptized in the
[6:16] middle of a snowstorm
[6:18] amen so we're excited to do that and we
[6:20] thank god for that
[6:21] i also want to remind you that brother
[6:22] aaron mcgeary will be here on sunday and
[6:25] he'll be taking both services the
[6:27] morning service and the afternoon
[6:28] service and we will be having communion
[6:30] and feet washing after
[6:32] the second service so pray for his
[6:34] family they'll be traveling up tomorrow
[6:36] and keep them in your prayers also i'd
[6:38] like to remind you friday
[6:39] the prayer time here in the sanctuary
[6:41] from 1 to 5 and also saturday
[6:44] from 5 to 10. so keep that in your mind
[6:48] all right let's look at isaiah chapter
[6:49] 60 together
[6:52] isaiah chapter 60 verse 1
[6:56] arise shine for thy light has come
[6:59] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[7:02] thee
[7:03] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[7:05] earth in gross darkness to people
[7:07] but the lord shall arise upon thee and
[7:09] his glory shall be seen
[7:11] upon thee this is such an important
[7:14] scripture
[7:15] to know that brother branham starts with
[7:16] this scripture when he's preaching
[7:18] shalom
[7:19] because he says arise and shine forth
[7:21] thy light has come
[7:23] right and the glory of the lord has
[7:25] risen
[7:26] upon thee because brother branham is
[7:28] talking about shalom he's going to be
[7:29] talking of the breaking of a new day
[7:31] and the rising of the sun and the glory
[7:34] of the lord has risen
[7:35] upon thee for behold darkness shall
[7:38] cover the earth and gross darkness the
[7:40] people but the lord shall arise
[7:42] this is the rising of the sun the lord
[7:45] shall arise
[7:46] upon thee and his glory shall be seen
[7:49] upon thee praise be to god amen that is
[7:53] the rising of the sun
[7:55] but where will it be upon thee amen
[7:58] let's turn to psalm 62 this is the other
[8:01] scripture that brother banham opened
[8:02] with
[8:03] for this service psalm 62
[8:08] and verse 1 we'll read from 1 to 8.
[8:13] psalm 62 1-8
[8:18] truly my soul waiteth upon god from him
[8:21] cometh my salvation
[8:23] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[8:25] is my defense
[8:26] i shall not be greatly moved how long
[8:29] will you imagine mischief against a man
[8:31] ye shall
[8:32] be slain all of you as a bowing wall
[8:34] shall ye be and as a tottering fence
[8:37] they only consult to cast him down from
[8:39] his excellency
[8:40] they delight in lies they bless with
[8:42] their mouth but they curse inwardly
[8:44] sila my soul wait thou only upon god for
[8:48] my expectation is from him
[8:50] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[8:52] is my defense
[8:54] i shall not be moved and god is my
[8:56] salvation and my glory the rock of my
[8:58] strength and my refuge
[9:00] is in god trust in him at all times ye
[9:03] people pour out your heart before him
[9:05] god is a refuge for us sila
[9:08] amen let's bow our heads to pray
[9:11] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[9:13] jesus for this night
[9:15] lord we thank you for the opportunity to
[9:16] be gathered together and for the
[9:17] protection that you gave us on the road
[9:19] coming in
[9:20] and lord we we've come here lord to
[9:23] listen to this tape tonight lord i pray
[9:25] that you would break it fresh to us lord
[9:27] may it not be something that was from
[9:29] long ago but lord maybe realize that
[9:31] this was for today
[9:33] and may you bring it fresh to us as
[9:35] fresh manna from heaven lord and
[9:36] open our ears to here in our eyes to see
[9:39] and that we may perceive what you're
[9:40] trying to speak to us tonight
[9:42] lord bless us in jesus christ's name
[9:44] amen
[9:45] you can all be seated i want to
[9:49] do a just a quick review on where we've
[9:51] been and then move on to the next
[9:52] section
[9:53] we're reading the message shalom from
[9:55] 1964
[9:56] and like i said every time i pick up a
[9:58] book or start a message
[9:59] i like to know where i'm at where i'm at
[10:02] in the prophet's life where i'm at in
[10:03] the sequence of events
[10:05] so this is the first message brother
[10:06] branham is going to preach he calls it
[10:08] his new year's message
[10:09] and the first message he's preaching in
[10:11] the year 1964
[10:13] he preaches it january 12 1964
[10:16] and he preaches it in a place called
[10:19] sierra
[10:20] vista arizona if you open to the not to
[10:24] the
[10:24] if you open to the front cover and then
[10:26] turn the page one more time
[10:28] down in the bottom left hand corner you
[10:30] have some details on the message
[10:32] i like to go through this because we've
[10:33] always got young people coming up and
[10:35] teenagers and
[10:36] kids who are grabbing books for the
[10:37] first time and if you look down here it
[10:39] gives you the title shalom
[10:41] and it tells you the year and the date
[10:44] 1964
[10:45] 01 january 12th so it was january 12th
[10:48] it says a message by brother
[10:50] william marion branham was delivered on
[10:51] sunday morning january 12 1964
[10:54] at a house meeting in sierra vista
[10:56] arizona usa
[10:57] the the tape number 64-0112
[11:02] is two hours and 22 minutes so
[11:05] i always look at this i don't know i
[11:07] just like details so
[11:08] for me i always look at this because i
[11:10] want to know where he preached it
[11:12] i want to know you know it's nice to
[11:14] know sometimes the crowd he's addressing
[11:16] it to because brother branham sometimes
[11:18] changes the way he phrases things
[11:19] depending on the crowd he's speaking to
[11:22] and so sometimes it's nice to know is he
[11:24] speaking to a denominational crowd
[11:26] here he's in a home meeting of people
[11:27] who accept his message so he's a little
[11:29] freer
[11:30] and in jeffersonville he's very free and
[11:32] so it's important to know where he's
[11:34] preaching
[11:35] amen and where he is in the timeline of
[11:37] events now
[11:38] 1964 was a huge year for the
[11:40] supernatural
[11:41] we have the sword in the hand the i mean
[11:43] moving the arizona the sword in the hand
[11:46] the cloud appearing coming and preaching
[11:48] the seals and then all the events that
[11:50] happened after that
[11:51] it was a huge year and now he's moving
[11:53] into 1964 and this is his first message
[11:56] and he's in arizona preaching this in a
[11:58] house meeting
[11:59] so i like those things i like to know
[12:01] where we're at
[12:02] it helps me when i read this and also as
[12:04] i go through
[12:05] i brother branham doesn't just pick
[12:07] titles you know for me
[12:08] everything he did was ordained he's not
[12:11] just picking titles because they're cute
[12:12] he's not picking titles
[12:14] but this title means something shalom
[12:15] and so when i listen to this message
[12:17] i like to know what the title is and
[12:19] hold it in my mind because that's what
[12:20] he's trying to get us to see
[12:22] is what is this shalom amen
[12:25] so i asked a few questions last time i'm
[12:27] just going to go over two of them
[12:29] the first one is what is shalom so if
[12:31] you turn with me
[12:32] to is it page seven
[12:37] we'll go to the bottom of page 7
[12:40] paragraph 38
[12:43] now my text for this morning is an odd
[12:45] word shalom
[12:46] shalom in the hebrew means peace and
[12:48] that's what i say to the church this
[12:50] morning
[12:50] shalom that's peace turn the page over
[12:53] to page 8 and go down to paragraph 43
[12:56] then the church the reason i'd say
[12:58] shalom to them is because that it's
[13:00] god's peace
[13:01] so he says it's peace but then he
[13:03] references it's god's peace
[13:05] the true shalom is god's peace
[13:08] then we ask the question what is a rock
[13:10] in scripture because when we read from
[13:12] uh psalms chapter 62 says the lord is my
[13:15] rock and my salvation
[13:16] and and if we look at uh back on page 7
[13:21] at paragraph 32 he answers this question
[13:25] now if you notice in the scripture
[13:26] reading there in the psalms
[13:28] it kept saying god is my rock do you
[13:30] know what a rock represents in the bible
[13:32] a rock in the bible here represents the
[13:34] revelation of god see
[13:36] god is my revelation he he is see
[13:40] the revelation of the word is the rock
[13:42] go down to paragraph 37
[13:44] and david's speaking here god is our
[13:46] rock god is our rock when god has been
[13:48] revealed to
[13:49] us that becomes a roxy god is our rock
[13:53] so we can say god is a rock but unless
[13:57] god has been revealed to us
[13:58] then god is not our rock it's the
[14:01] revelation
[14:02] of the word and i would say it's the
[14:03] revelation of the word for our day
[14:05] that becomes the rock and god becomes
[14:08] our rock when god has revealed to us the
[14:10] word revealed for our day
[14:12] that is the rock that is the rock of
[14:13] salvation that is the
[14:15] the rock that we hide in that is the
[14:17] rock that we're supported by
[14:18] that is a rock in the scripture so we've
[14:20] got to be careful that when we say
[14:22] uh god is a rock that we know what
[14:24] brother brennan means
[14:26] that it's the revelation of the word the
[14:29] revelation of god
[14:30] that is given to us praise the lord
[14:34] let's turn over to page 14.
[14:38] we're going to begin at the top of page
[14:39] 14 at paragraph 70.
[14:41] i'm going to ask a couple questions i'd
[14:43] like to have these questions so that we
[14:46] all are working these out together as we
[14:48] go through so if you've got a pen and
[14:49] paper and you like to write them down
[14:51] we'll go through a couple questions here
[14:54] the first question is what does the moon
[14:56] represent so brother bryan's going to
[14:58] explain this
[14:59] and many of us already know these things
[15:01] but it's interesting to hear him say it
[15:03] and go through it
[15:04] question number one what does the moon
[15:05] represent
[15:09] question number two why is the church in
[15:12] darkness
[15:16] so question 1 was what does the moon
[15:18] represent question 2 why
[15:19] is the church in darkness
[15:25] question number three what is
[15:28] the light to the church
[15:34] what is the light to the church number
[15:38] three
[15:41] number four what does the morning star
[15:44] testify of so number four
[15:48] what does the morning star
[15:52] testify i'm trying to go slow because
[15:54] there's smoke rolling off of pins
[15:58] number four what does the morning star
[16:01] testify of
[16:06] and then number five
[16:09] what did they hate jesus for
[16:14] brother makes a specific statement and
[16:16] here we'll hear
[16:17] what did they hate jesus for number five
[16:20] so we're going to begin on page 14
[16:23] paragraph
[16:23] 70 and we'll go to the bottom of
[16:26] paragraph 165
[16:28] on page 28. i'm not going to try to get
[16:30] the whole thing finished today we're
[16:31] going to break it into three parts so we
[16:32] can take some time
[16:34] and discuss it as we go and so we will
[16:37] begin
[16:38] top of page 14 paragraph 70. brother
[16:41] franco if you can go ahead and turn that
[16:43] on for us
[16:45] that son is a word of god in the
[16:47] beginning god said
[16:49] let there be light and when the
[16:52] manifested word of god when the word of
[16:55] god was
[16:56] manifested there was light
[17:00] first god spoke it what if it didn't
[17:02] manifest then it wasn't light yet
[17:05] but when he spoke it and then it was
[17:07] manifested vindicated his word was a
[17:09] vindicated
[17:10] light come into existence that's the
[17:12] only way it can be done now
[17:14] it's when the word is vindicated god's
[17:17] written word a vindicated then it shows
[17:20] light
[17:21] it's a portion lip are put out for each
[17:24] age we found in the church ages we find
[17:26] in the old
[17:27] the old testament church ages each time
[17:30] that there come a time
[17:31] for a a certain manifestation of a
[17:34] journey
[17:34] there was a prophet came to the earth
[17:37] and the word came to the prophet and he
[17:38] made that word
[17:39] live and when that word was identified
[17:43] it reflected god and there was
[17:47] the the age there was a light that's way
[17:50] light comes today
[17:52] now i have nothing against any
[17:55] denomination
[17:57] uh people but i have all that i can
[18:01] think about
[18:01] against the systems because they're
[18:03] wrong
[18:05] and the first system that ever rose up
[18:09] was the the roman system of the roman
[18:11] catholic church
[18:13] that was the first organization that
[18:15] ever was organized as a roman catholic
[18:17] church
[18:18] nazi aroma about 325 years after the
[18:22] death of christ
[18:24] 325 came forth the roman
[18:28] church organization that put the people
[18:31] together and blended out anything else
[18:33] that was contrary to it
[18:35] that's where they got their strange
[18:37] doctrines and started off in a system
[18:39] away from the word
[18:42] and now that church since that time
[18:46] has exactly reflected
[18:50] darkness because
[18:53] at that time we go through what we call
[18:55] the dark ages
[18:56] about a thousand years it's known to all
[18:59] historians and bible scholars and so
[19:01] forth as the dark ages
[19:04] that's when the roman church controlled
[19:06] everything
[19:08] and this roman church is the the
[19:12] mother of harlots the bible said in
[19:14] revelation
[19:15] 17 she was mother of hearts
[19:18] now that is immoral unclean living of a
[19:21] woman
[19:22] both of them is the same thing both the
[19:24] same
[19:26] so if if uh harlot it had to be a woman
[19:31] so therefore you notice it's not harlot
[19:33] but
[19:34] harlots see she
[19:38] is her singular then the church's
[19:41] is called
[19:42] harlots daughters of
[19:45] the roman uh
[19:49] she is a mother of all of it the mother
[19:52] of organization
[19:54] and is it not a strange thing
[20:02] that in this day that when we have
[20:06] come through all these things and the
[20:08] message has crossed the earth against
[20:10] organization it's blasted it from right
[20:14] to left
[20:16] that in this hour that's been told since
[20:19] 1933 when the holy spirit gave me that
[20:21] visions and showed me the end time
[20:24] seven things that i spoke of and five of
[20:26] them has already happened perfectly
[20:28] right on like
[20:29] germany and italy and all the wars and
[20:32] the national things
[20:33] seldom speaks to me on those things but
[20:36] they happened just exactly the way he
[20:38] said that happened
[20:39] how mussolini would go to ethiopia and
[20:42] ethiopia followed his step
[20:43] and then how did he come to a disgrace
[20:45] and be spit on by his own people and
[20:47] this grace hung upside down with that
[20:49] prostitute that he lived with
[20:50] on the street how that the americas
[20:53] would go to war with germany to take an
[20:55] awful beating at a place called a great
[20:58] line where there would be
[20:59] concrete fortified and they're i believe
[21:02] it's called the siegfried line
[21:04] and uh there's one called meds now i
[21:07] believe that was a french was that right
[21:09] and the siegfried line was a german
[21:11] and the lord let me see that 11 years
[21:13] before it was built
[21:14] amen and they never would admit getting
[21:16] a beating on it the americans wouldn't
[21:18] know they almost
[21:19] sunk the complete army when they wanted
[21:21] or the germans had their
[21:22] guns just trained right out on that
[21:23] fleet let it get right in there and
[21:24] almost sunk it
[21:26] i've seen that 11 years before the line
[21:28] was ever
[21:29] ever a foundation was ever poured for it
[21:31] or anything the siegfried line
[21:34] and all these other things like machines
[21:36] and automobiles and
[21:37] and how everything has come right down
[21:39] exactly what he said until
[21:41] a woman ruling this nation which perhaps
[21:44] is the church
[21:45] and then the income now
[21:49] we find that in this all this thing and
[21:52] have
[21:53] blasted against the organization isn't
[21:55] it a strange thing that the pope
[21:58] of rome would leave
[22:01] rome for his first time to go back to
[22:04] jerusalem amen
[22:09] and doing this jerusalem is known the
[22:13] oldest
[22:14] church in all the world when melchizedek
[22:19] met abraham from the slaughter of the
[22:21] kings he was a king
[22:23] of jerusalem a priest which was christ
[22:27] it was god no one else could be
[22:30] melchizedek but christ himself
[22:32] a god himself brother god himself
[22:35] because he was without father
[22:38] and without mother see jesus had both
[22:42] father
[22:42] and mother so this man was without
[22:46] father without mother
[22:48] without beginning a days or ending of
[22:50] life
[22:52] and whoever he was he still lives
[22:56] and he was king at that time
[22:59] of salem which is interpreted king of
[23:02] peace
[23:04] shalom
[23:07] king of jerusalem
[23:10] who met abraham and give him wine
[23:14] and bread communion after the battle a
[23:17] very beautiful type there in
[23:18] the seventh chapter of hebrews we find
[23:20] it
[23:21] now gave him bread and wine after the
[23:24] battle was over
[23:27] as he that's the first thing we'll take
[23:28] after we enter into the new kingdom
[23:30] we'll eat it anew with him in the
[23:32] father's kingdom the bread and wine
[23:34] not drink the fruit of the vine or eat
[23:37] the bread anymore until i idiot you and
[23:39] you
[23:39] and the father's kingdom that day now
[23:44] now when we find out that after
[23:48] king shalom
[23:51] was in the come from the city then
[23:55] creed took it over later and it's
[23:58] constantly being created but
[24:00] it represents the old church
[24:04] and we're taught in the new testament
[24:06] don't fail to get this
[24:09] in the new testament that we are not
[24:12] of this city jerusalem on earth but we
[24:16] are
[24:16] from the new jerusalem above
[24:21] so this must be the moon jerusalem
[24:25] and not the new jerusalem above
[24:29] so the moon representing the church
[24:33] earthly and uh isn't it strange that
[24:37] just before the pope
[24:40] took his journey to jerusalem
[24:45] that the moon in the heavens made a
[24:48] total blackout
[24:49] amen just a few days before he took it
[24:54] his journey he's coming here also you
[24:57] know
[24:58] now that's never been known
[25:02] but what does it show that
[25:05] this is doing this to
[25:09] wind fellowship as he met on the
[25:12] day after he come into jerusalem he met
[25:15] the greek orthodox
[25:17] hierarchy and what does that reflect
[25:22] fellowship their wanting protestants
[25:26] and catholicism joining together which
[25:29] they
[25:29] are doing and will completely do and god
[25:33] reflected this to us
[25:34] in the moon of a total blackout amen
[25:40] by his mercy grace did any of you see
[25:43] the paper where they took the pictures
[25:44] of the moon
[25:46] i have it here if it ain't a perfect
[25:48] image leaving out the seventh age which
[25:50] is not yet
[25:51] exactly the way i drawed but the holy
[25:54] spirit
[25:56] the church ages
[25:59] there's the six of them the seventh is
[26:01] not finished yet
[26:03] the six conditions of the moon how in
[26:06] its brightness in the first church age
[26:08] darken the second third fourth fifth and
[26:11] sixth
[26:13] just the way the holy spirit let me draw
[26:16] them
[26:17] on the board and then identified him
[26:19] with himself
[26:21] on the wall of the tabernacle two years
[26:24] ago
[26:25] the moon reflects itself and science
[26:28] again
[26:29] picks up the picture of the church ages
[26:34] just as they picked up that light hunter
[26:37] and put it in life magazine of the
[26:39] opening of the seals
[26:42] are the revealing in the age of the
[26:44] seventh angel
[26:47] in the days of his ministry the seventh
[26:50] messenger
[26:51] the mysteries of god which all the
[26:53] mysteries has been
[26:54] along the ages should be revealed made
[26:57] manifest
[26:58] it should be at that time amen and he
[27:01] did it
[27:03] his words don't fail
[27:07] isn't that a mysterious thing
[27:11] god drawing in the heavens the same
[27:14] thing that the whole scene
[27:16] god let me draw on the blackboard and
[27:19] then by himself that's three times he's
[27:21] perfectly
[27:22] identified and just before
[27:25] the pope goes in uh to jerusalem
[27:28] which that was the church the moon is
[27:31] the church
[27:32] represents the church and before the
[27:34] church the shadow
[27:36] of the world crosses the moon and the
[27:39] shadow
[27:40] of worthyism amen
[27:43] the shadow of willingness worthy church
[27:47] has swept across the blackout
[27:50] the entire life of the bible
[27:57] the world got in the light of the
[28:00] reflection
[28:03] do you understand
[28:07] the world crossed the in the light of
[28:10] the moon and
[28:11] blinded out the sun
[28:14] and the reflection of the moon that's
[28:17] supposed to be giving light to the earth
[28:19] it was blacked out and it come in and
[28:22] draw the pictures just exactly like it
[28:24] did by inspiration before it happened
[28:27] now that i believe sister simpson was a
[28:29] tucson paper
[28:30] uh i don't know his sister's son simpson
[28:33] she didn't understand it and she said
[28:34] i cut out some pictures for you and some
[28:36] notes out of the paper and handed to me
[28:38] i thought something strange i went in
[28:39] there and picked it up looked at i said
[28:41] there it is
[28:41] just exactly see just what i've been
[28:43] looking for and there it was
[28:45] in the paper sister simpson might tell
[28:46] you what paper it's in if you want to
[28:47] get a copy of it
[28:49] and by saying
[28:53] evening edition of december the 28th see
[28:55] before
[28:56] he went to jerusalem
[29:01] to block out his life or what excess it
[29:05] does have
[29:06] what time position and what rights it
[29:08] has to shine
[29:09] now it's cutting it off altogether
[29:13] for the last age the seventh church age
[29:16] where she goes into darkness
[29:20] what a great thing the lord is telling
[29:23] us
[29:25] and everything it's never failed
[29:28] but what god in the heaven has declared
[29:30] it
[29:31] and told it look to it and here's
[29:34] identified it and
[29:36] vindicated it that it is the absolute
[29:39] truth
[29:41] darkness this lady i see a church age
[29:46] now when jesus which is the word
[29:51] in the ladies church age was on the
[29:53] outside
[29:54] of the church knocking at the door
[29:57] trying to get in
[29:59] darkness gross darkness upon this people
[30:04] was a bible right the perfection of the
[30:07] scripture
[30:09] glory of his great name the pope's visit
[30:13] was a sign of the churches
[30:15] blackening out his manifested
[30:18] uh the manifested light of the world
[30:21] was the bible jesus said he was the
[30:24] light of the world
[30:25] the bible said that he is the word
[30:30] and the manifested or the vindicated
[30:33] scripture
[30:34] is the light now you'll not be permitted
[30:38] to do it when this takes a hold
[30:40] and we've seen it foreshadowed told by
[30:42] inspiration
[30:43] before it happens foreshadowed by the
[30:45] moon and shorts happen and here it is
[30:46] taking place
[30:50] the hour is upon us darkness gross
[30:54] darkness
[30:54] grows darkness on the people now that's
[30:57] what it is
[30:59] what does it all mean where are we
[31:02] standing what how
[31:04] are we in
[31:07] how close are we to the coming
[31:11] well they say when all they have a
[31:12] revival fear not little flock
[31:15] it's your father's good will to give you
[31:17] the kingdom
[31:18] all right what does it mean god has
[31:22] begun to separate
[31:23] the light from the darkness see
[31:26] pressing it behind
[31:30] like he did in the beginning to show the
[31:33] dawn of a new day
[31:35] the church ages are fading out
[31:39] for me the church ages are fading out
[31:43] god is pressing the darkness
[31:47] into a place that has to do it to fade
[31:49] out
[31:50] the church organizations fade out the
[31:53] world
[31:53] the world is covering the thing over and
[31:55] over the whole thing
[31:57] that isn't god right by worldly things
[32:00] in worldly dressing and worldly acting
[32:01] and worldly living
[32:02] it's the world ye are not of the world
[32:05] little children
[32:06] amen you are
[32:10] heaven this is not your home
[32:14] why should i look to us older people try
[32:17] to look back and get young again
[32:20] we can't do that but we're looking
[32:23] forward not looking back looking here
[32:27] what has been we won't know what's going
[32:29] to be
[32:31] and we're looking for that hour pressing
[32:34] part
[32:35] so many good sincere people today
[32:38] are caught away in these creeds
[32:43] these churches and organizations having
[32:45] a form of godliness but denying the
[32:47] power thereof
[32:49] as second timothy the third chapter says
[32:51] so
[32:54] gross darkness blinding of israel was
[32:57] for the lightning of the gentiles
[32:59] now the blinding of the gentiles is the
[33:01] lightning of the israel
[33:03] it's just like the day and night one
[33:05] side has got darkness the other side's
[33:07] got light and the light comes over on
[33:08] the other side
[33:10] so the moon passing the way it did
[33:13] and the reflection of the darkness of
[33:14] the world blinding out its light
[33:17] is a reflection of us that the gentile
[33:19] church age is finished
[33:21] amen the church is making herself ready
[33:24] then make herself ready for a time it's
[33:26] time for the rapture
[33:29] for darkness is fading upon
[33:33] the gentiles and dawn will soon break
[33:36] upon the jews the sun has traveled from
[33:39] the east to the west and we're on the
[33:40] west coast
[33:42] the light can only do one thing go back
[33:44] east on the other side
[33:50] you understand do you the light can only
[33:52] go back east again
[33:55] to where it began at israel
[33:59] god blinded them for a while but the the
[34:01] darkness now is pressed upon the gentile
[34:04] world
[34:04] that's covered the whole thing the
[34:06] gentiles will trod down
[34:08] jerusalem until amen
[34:11] the gentile dispensation will be
[34:13] finished
[34:14] jesus said so and now
[34:17] it's finished amen gross darkness upon
[34:20] the people
[34:22] god reflected in the skies as he has
[34:25] shown it on earth before it all happens
[34:28] we're in it good people caught in this
[34:31] thing
[34:33] good people sincere people
[34:36] like mary and joseph they were very
[34:39] sincere
[34:40] see thinking he was with them
[34:44] when he wasn't amen
[34:47] mary and joseph you know when is up to
[34:49] the feast jesus the age of 12 they
[34:51] thought presuming he was with them but
[34:54] he wasn't
[34:57] good people today think the same thing
[35:00] they these people it's organizing this
[35:02] council of churches
[35:04] these people in these organizations
[35:07] they they think they're doing a good
[35:09] thing they're presuming he's with them
[35:11] when they're not
[35:14] see many people think that he was with
[35:16] them when they shook hands with a
[35:17] preacher and put their name on the book
[35:19] but he wasn't many people thought when
[35:22] they were
[35:23] uh uh sprinkled confirmed baptized the
[35:26] name of father son holy ghost
[35:29] thinking he was with them
[35:33] they're good people mary and joseph was
[35:35] good people
[35:37] but the facts was he wasn't there
[35:41] don't pursue anything what is life the
[35:44] vindicated spoken word of god
[35:48] outside of that there's no light
[35:50] [Applause]
[35:52] see can't lighten the earth with
[35:54] flashlights
[35:57] it takes god's word that's made manifest
[35:59] the son
[36:02] they were good people no accuracy of his
[36:06] word
[36:08] how perfect it is did you notice what
[36:11] mary said
[36:13] now to you dear catholic people
[36:16] i'm not against you
[36:20] i have nothing against you it's a system
[36:23] that you're in
[36:25] and your protestants the same thing it's
[36:28] the systems
[36:30] mary mother of god
[36:34] find out a 12 year old boy of her own
[36:37] son had a center in order there's not
[36:40] one time in the bible where jesus ever
[36:42] called mary
[36:43] his mother she wasn't his mother
[36:46] amen amen how could she be a mother of
[36:49] god
[36:50] amen she was only a womb
[36:53] amen that he used to come to the earth
[36:56] to be manifested to the earth
[36:59] through the womb there's nothing to it
[37:01] at all
[37:02] not one scripture ever said mother amen
[37:05] notice how mary is so wrong but his
[37:08] words so perfect
[37:12] she said to him when she found him in
[37:14] the temple at 12
[37:16] discussing with the theologians
[37:19] he was down to them as a 12 year old boy
[37:21] not even in school
[37:26] or if it is we have no record of it
[37:29] but a 12 year old lad confounding the
[37:34] sages in the temple that is wisdom amen
[37:38] amen she said thy father and i have
[37:40] sought thee with tears
[37:44] thy father the mother herself
[37:48] supposingly said thy father joseph and i
[37:51] had sought thee
[37:52] with tears what did he say to her know
[37:55] ye
[37:56] not that i must be about my father's
[37:58] business
[38:00] if he'd been about joseph business he'd
[38:01] been making houses or
[38:03] in a carpenter shop but he wasn't
[38:05] joseph's son
[38:07] amen i'm about my father's business
[38:10] correcting these denominations and
[38:12] creeds and things i hear
[38:15] um about my father's business he never
[38:17] admitted joseph was his father
[38:20] but mary did and he turned back around
[38:23] and straightened her out
[38:25] she said your father and i have sought
[38:26] you said i'm about my father's business
[38:32] showing joseph wasn't his father his
[38:34] words are perfect
[38:35] amen but mary in them
[38:40] just presuming that well see what it was
[38:43] she got carried away
[38:47] she she got she wanted to show before
[38:50] these priests and things
[38:51] that that she wasn't the type of woman
[38:55] and she in doing that she absolutely
[38:58] tore the foundation out from under her
[39:00] testimony amen
[39:02] after she had testified that an angel
[39:04] had come to her
[39:06] and said thou shalt conceive and bear a
[39:08] son
[39:09] knowing no man a virgin born son here
[39:12] before the high sanhedrin she says
[39:17] joseph your father here and i have
[39:19] sought you
[39:21] and that 12 year old boy said i'm about
[39:24] my father's business
[39:26] he rebuked her that isn't my father
[39:29] see the church today carried away with
[39:32] councils and
[39:33] and things of the world now she's
[39:36] blacked out
[39:38] god's rebuking here
[39:45] never did jesus ever call her mother
[39:48] one day she came to visit him at his
[39:51] meeting
[39:51] in a house something like this someone
[39:54] come said
[39:54] outside the door there your mother and
[39:56] brothers wait for you
[39:58] he said who is my mother
[40:02] my brothers who are they
[40:05] looked right upon his disciples and said
[40:07] they that do the will of my father
[40:09] is my mother my brother my sister
[40:12] so forth that's who it does and at the
[40:14] cross
[40:16] when he was dying he said to john
[40:21] a young disciple he said
[40:25] behold thy mother
[40:29] amen woman behold thy son
[40:33] son behold thy mother
[40:37] see never cleaned himself it wasn't her
[40:40] son
[40:43] it was god's son she was just a womb
[40:49] this is a house this morning
[40:52] but it's not the church amen
[40:56] the church is in you christ
[41:00] the spirit of the mortals is sitting
[41:02] here met together in heavenly places
[41:06] it's christ not the house the house is
[41:08] all right
[41:09] it's serving its purpose but it's only
[41:12] used for
[41:13] a meeting place mary was only a womb
[41:18] amen that he used to come to the earth
[41:20] to be identify himself amongst the
[41:22] people
[41:24] not the mother of god no more than this
[41:26] house
[41:27] is a church of god it's just used for
[41:30] that
[41:32] yeah many friends think now people good
[41:34] people like mary and joseph think
[41:36] that that he's with them in doing this
[41:39] but as they were then so are they now
[41:42] mistaken
[41:45] he thought this with him but there
[41:46] wasn't but uh when they was baptized
[41:50] people might thought oh i received him
[41:52] when i accepted him
[41:53] was baptized that isn't it the spoken
[41:56] word reflects itself
[41:59] but the elected what about the light now
[42:01] i've been talking so much on the dark
[42:03] and i've got half my time up
[42:05] 11 30. now let's turn it back around
[42:08] gross darkness is up on the people now
[42:10] what about the light
[42:14] he said gross darkness would be upon the
[42:16] people but there would be
[42:18] life rise and shine for the light has
[42:20] come
[42:22] how can it be darkness and light it's
[42:24] got to be separated amen and only one
[42:26] thing separates it
[42:27] the word amen amen
[42:30] separates it presses it to the other
[42:32] side here's the darkness on the earth
[42:34] but when the
[42:35] manifested word of god the sun which was
[42:37] spoken into existence by the word
[42:39] shows itself darkness runs to the other
[42:42] side amen
[42:43] that's what's taking place now amen
[42:45] darkness separating
[42:47] the self from the light now to the
[42:50] electric church in this dark
[42:51] hour which we could stay on that for
[42:53] hours but i think i've said enough do
[42:55] you understand why
[42:56] what the scripture means when i set the
[42:57] gross darkness upon this people
[43:00] nah say to the church shalom
[43:04] hey god's peace
[43:08] peace ever true hebrew when he means to
[43:10] that shalom
[43:13] in other words good morning
[43:18] god be with you god's peace go with you
[43:23] it's a good morning how do you do
[43:28] it's breaking day church
[43:31] amen that's darkness upon the people but
[43:33] it's good morning to the church
[43:36] christ is appearing among us shalom
[43:39] peace
[43:42] hallelujah amen
[43:45] shalom when we see darkness settling
[43:48] dark it's just before day we know that
[43:51] the morning stars hanging on her to
[43:52] introduce the coming sun
[43:56] it's that's when the morning star shines
[43:59] it's uh it's it's the going between
[44:02] it's always dark as just a few minutes
[44:04] before dave
[44:06] the blackout comes
[44:09] the moon fails to shine the darkest
[44:12] before day
[44:12] is because the light is pressing the
[44:15] darkness
[44:17] but the morning star comes out and says
[44:19] good morning
[44:21] amen that's him among us
[44:24] his word being identified shalom
[44:28] the great day is fixing to break when
[44:31] the morning breaks eternal bright and
[44:32] fair
[44:33] when his chosen one shall gather to
[44:36] their home
[44:37] beyond the sky when the roll is called
[44:41] up beyond earth
[44:42] i'll be there our names are on his book
[44:46] we'll be there shalom good morning peace
[44:49] be
[44:50] unto you the darkness
[44:53] is separating itself from the light
[44:55] god's caused it the lights are doing it
[44:57] see the lights press itself in such a
[44:59] way until the darkness has to congregate
[45:01] together
[45:02] they've had a chance to accept it and
[45:03] they wouldn't do it
[45:06] so it's condensed itself and they do
[45:09] that
[45:10] by the putting the church together in
[45:13] the council churches and united with the
[45:15] pagan darkness
[45:17] they so firmly disagree with one another
[45:19] but yet they had to go together to make
[45:21] the night
[45:21] come upon the people isaiah
[45:25] 6 and 1 says arise and shine for the
[45:27] light has come
[45:28] to you rise and shine
[45:32] the light has come the word light
[45:37] is vindicated again the light vindicated
[45:41] again god's word
[45:42] so that you can see god manifested in
[45:45] his promise of the
[45:46] light of the day or the word given to
[45:48] this age
[45:51] see these promises is made for this day
[45:55] these promises that were said by the
[45:57] prophets and by jesus himself
[46:00] in this day god and sun are times
[46:02] hebrews
[46:03] 1 god and son are a time in diverse
[46:07] manners spake to the fathers to the
[46:08] prophets
[46:09] but in this last day to his son jesus
[46:12] christ amen
[46:14] the great light that hung in the
[46:16] wilderness which was
[46:18] at moses forsake egypt esteeming the
[46:20] reproach of christ greater treasures
[46:21] than that of egypt

[46:29] light same pillar of fire
[46:31] saul of being a hebrew would never
[46:33] worship any spirit in there call it lord
[46:36] in the position he was in he said lord
[46:38] who are you said i'm jesus

[46:47] to manifest amen to to make
[46:50] known to the people amen the promises
[46:54] that he's made for this day
[46:57] manifested life of the day
[47:02] the darkness is dark and when he come he
[47:05] was the light of the day
[47:06] they were supposed to become a messiah
[47:09] and he came
[47:10] just exactly like god said he did would
[47:12] come
[47:13] and when he did what was he the light of
[47:15] the day
[47:16] and it pressed the darkness so against
[47:18] him
[47:19] amen is that right he had to give his
[47:21] life that the like
[47:23] continue could shine
[47:26] he was the light of the day but why why
[47:28] was he the light of day he was the
[47:30] vindicated
[47:31] word that had been spoken made manifest
[47:34] amen
[47:35] no more than god said over this dark
[47:38] gloomy
[47:38] dismal marsty world that stood here
[47:41] without light he said
[47:42] let there be light
[47:46] and it wasn't life until that word was
[47:48] manifested
[47:50] that was life he said there will come a
[47:53] savior a messiah
[47:55] [Applause]
[47:56] it still wasn't manifested until he come
[47:59] to manifest that promise
[48:01] and when he vindicated that promise he
[48:04] said search the scriptures for in them
[48:06] you think you have eternal life and they
[48:08] are they that testify on me
[48:10] they said we don't know when style
[48:11] cometh we are moses disciples
[48:13] he said if you were moses disciples
[48:16] you'd know me for moses wrote on me amen
[48:19] he was a manifestation he was the
[48:22] authentication
[48:23] of the spoken word of god by moses amen
[48:27] and today that we're now living in
[48:31] god has come on the scene amen
[48:34] to vindicate and prove his promises

[48:51] shining out there the sunshine this
[48:52] morning
[48:53] that's god's spoken word
[48:58] nothing else can give light like that
[49:01] there's nothing can do it
[49:02] any artificial light burns out a little
[49:04] bit and bubs and everything else but
[49:06] that never fails
[49:08] for it's a spoken word of god made
[49:10] manifest
[49:12] little denominational creeds of bust
[49:14] above and blow a bubble and
[49:15] knock a fuse and everything else amen
[49:19] but the word of god shall never fail

[49:44] god's spoken word the light of the hour
[49:46] john the baptist was the light of the
[49:48] hour
[49:49] he was the light before jesus was light
[49:54] the prophet isaiah said a voice upon
[49:57] crying in the wilderness
[49:58] prepare the way of the lord and make
[50:00] straight his path that was a spoken word
[50:02] of god
[50:03] he was laying there he hadn't come to
[50:05] life yet malachi the last prophet 400
[50:08] years before taking place
[50:10] he said behold i send my messenger
[50:12] before me
[50:13] to prepare the way of the lord here
[50:16] comes all
[50:17] the wilderness without the nomination
[50:20] lock creed without identification
[50:23] but his light identified him the word
[50:26] identified him
[50:27] they said are you the messiah said i'm
[50:29] not but i'm the voice of one crying in
[50:31] the wilderness
[50:32] prepare the way of the lord jesus said

[50:35] walk in his light he was a bright and
[50:38] shining light for a while
[50:39] well until the wave was prepared

[53:52] identification
[53:54] when all time will fade out into
[53:56] eternity
[53:57] when jesus comes do as david did
[54:01] put your future into his hands
[54:05] don't look to anything else but put your
[54:06] david said here
[54:08] he said uh said my time is in his hands
[54:11] you notice here in the psalms where we
[54:12] read it in 62

[54:44] know he holds the future
[54:45] amen so he who holds the future
[54:48] holds me amen so why should i think
[54:51] about
[54:52] setting forth this for the new year i
[54:55] just put myself in his hands
[54:57] walk like david did my time is in his
[55:00] hand
[55:00] knew that god helped the future david
[55:02] didn't know what the future was
[55:04] but he knowed god had the future i don't
[55:06] know what the future is none of us do
[55:08] but we know he holds the future
[55:12] patience
[55:17] patience some of us get so
[55:22] um some of us gets in such a hurry
[55:25] i think a manny a good man has done that
[55:28] you're getting too mad too much of a
[55:30] hurry
[55:31] you want to see you don't do it yourself
[55:35] and minister brethren you know the way
[55:37] i'm talking you just listen to this tape
[55:39] i'm talking to you not only the little
[55:42] congregation here but
[55:43] man around the world many man go out
[55:48] impatient but believing at the time is
[55:50] near you try to do something within
[55:52] yourself
[55:55] wait upon the law patience is virtue
[56:00] if you can have patience it's virtue
[56:06] it's virtue if you they that wait upon
[56:08] the lord
[56:09] shall renew their strength not they that
[56:12] try to get ahead of the lord
[56:14] they to try to tell the lord lord i know
[56:16] you want me to do this and glory to god
[56:18] don't do that wait upon the lord
[56:21] the bible said they that way upon the
[56:23] lord shall renew their strength
[56:25] god took thousands of years to fulfill
[56:29] his
[56:30] promise of a coming savior but remember
[56:35] he knowed it all time when it's coming
[56:38] there were many people rose up and tried
[56:40] to be messiahs
[56:42] many churches try to produce messiahs
[56:46] but god had the time set for his messiah
[56:49] he was no hurry
[56:54] in during the time of this he showed
[56:56] many types of messiah
[56:59] he showed it all away from adam to the
[57:01] messiah
[57:02] first and last adam one of them of the
[57:05] world netherlands of heaven
[57:07] one earthly and the other in heavenly
[57:09] one come down from heaven the other come
[57:10] off the earth
[57:12] but promised a messiah he took thousands
[57:15] of years to fulfill it
[57:17] showed joseph exactly what he was joseph
[57:20] pro-trading
[57:21] david portrayed him when david was a
[57:23] rejected king
[57:25] went up on top the hill and looked back
[57:26] and went over jerusalem as a rejected
[57:28] king
[57:29] that was jesus and david
[57:33] 800 years later stood up on jerusalem as
[57:35] a rejected king
[57:37] said jerusalem jerusalem how often i've
[57:39] hovered you as a hen doesn't brew but
[57:41] you would not
[57:42] look at joseph born among his brother in
[57:45] the patriarchs
[57:49] not the last one next to the last one
[57:51] benjamin was the last one
[57:53] but just before the last
[57:56] just before hated of his brothers loved
[57:59] of his father
[58:01] he was hated because he was a spiritual
[58:03] man he could interpret dreams they were
[58:05] exactly right
[58:06] amen he could see visions foretell
[58:08] things that would happen
[58:09] and they hated him amen he was sold for
[58:12] 30 pieces of silver
[58:13] what did they hate jesus for they called
[58:16] him beelzebub
[58:17] because he was the word and the word can
[58:20] discern the thoughts that's in the heart
[58:22] they hated him and they sold him for 30
[58:25] pieces of silver
[58:26] he was stole into a
[58:30] pit joseph was supposedly to be dead his
[58:32] bloody coat was left behind like jesus
[58:34] bloody garment that
[58:36] was taken up from the cross the robe
[58:38] that he wore
[58:39] to identify his death but what did god
[58:42] do to joseph
[58:43] he brought him up out of the pit set him
[58:45] at the right hand of pharaoh
[58:48] and no man could see pharaoh only see
[58:50] joseph and when joseph left the palace
[58:52] trump explode amen and the proclamation
[58:56] went for
[58:56] every knee bow joseph is approaching
[59:00] same thing jesus he was taken from the
[59:02] pit supposedly before he was
[59:04] dead and raised up and sets at the right
[59:05] hand of the majesty no man has seen god

[59:09] father and when he leaves there the

[1:05:38] amen let's take a look at our questions
[1:05:42] here
[1:05:45] we'll go through this in review
[1:05:49] first question what does the moon
[1:05:52] represent
[1:05:54] amen so let's go to paragraph 78.
[1:05:59] paragraph 78
[1:06:03] is on page 16.
[1:06:08] i'm going to read for just a little bit
[1:06:09] here most of this page or
[1:06:11] i believe all of this page let's what
[1:06:13] does the moon represent
[1:06:16] now when we find out that after king
[1:06:18] shalom was
[1:06:19] come from the city then creed took it
[1:06:21] over later and it's constantly been
[1:06:23] creed but it represents the old church
[1:06:25] and we're taught in the new testament
[1:06:26] don't fail to get this in the new
[1:06:28] testament that we are not of this city
[1:06:30] jerusalem on earth
[1:06:31] but we are from the new jerusalem above
[1:06:34] so this must be the moon jerusalem not
[1:06:36] the new jerusalem above
[1:06:37] so the moon represents the church
[1:06:39] earthly
[1:06:40] so this is important to note because the
[1:06:42] moon represents the church earthly
[1:06:44] because the heavenly church will not be
[1:06:47] blackened out
[1:06:49] but it's the church earthly that's
[1:06:51] blackened out and goes into apostasy
[1:06:53] so brother branham is always through the
[1:06:55] church age addressing two
[1:06:57] vines that's running together two
[1:06:59] churches that's together
[1:07:00] amen there's a heavenly church and an
[1:07:02] earthly church a carnal church and a
[1:07:04] spiritual church together
[1:07:06] that's why when brother branham was
[1:07:07] drawing the symbols of the moon there
[1:07:09] was darkness and light in each age
[1:07:11] because those two vines were running
[1:07:12] together
[1:07:13] amen but at some point there's going to
[1:07:16] be a separation when the light comes
[1:07:18] and the church earthly goes into
[1:07:20] complete darkness
[1:07:21] but the bride the elect does not go into
[1:07:24] complete darkness
[1:07:25] that's the earthly church going to
[1:07:27] complete darkness and at that time that
[1:07:29] it moves into complete blackout
[1:07:31] the bride is pulled out into the new day
[1:07:35] the bright shining light of a new day
[1:07:38] she does not go into apostasy and she
[1:07:40] does not go into darkness
[1:07:43] hallelujah all around us total darkness
[1:07:46] but inside of us arise and shine for thy
[1:07:49] light has come
[1:07:50] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[1:07:53] thee
[1:07:53] the breaking of a new day where and the
[1:07:56] bride
[1:07:58] hallelujah i love that so it makes it
[1:08:01] really clear right here
[1:08:03] that we're not from jerusalem earthly
[1:08:05] which is the natural church
[1:08:06] we're from new jerusalem which is above
[1:08:09] but we up until the last age it was
[1:08:11] mixed together but in the last age when
[1:08:14] the light come it separated it out
[1:08:16] and one went into total blackout and one
[1:08:18] went into the new day
[1:08:22] i can never say that enough it gets more
[1:08:24] exciting every time we say that
[1:08:28] all right paragraph 79 and isn't it
[1:08:29] strange that just before the pope took
[1:08:31] his journey to jerusalem
[1:08:32] that the moon and the heavens made a
[1:08:34] total blackout just a few days before he
[1:08:36] took his journey
[1:08:37] he comes here also you know see now
[1:08:40] that's
[1:08:40] never been known see but what does it
[1:08:42] show that this
[1:08:43] he's doing this to win fellowship as he
[1:08:46] met on the day after he come
[1:08:48] into jerusalem he met the greek orthodox
[1:08:50] hierarchy and what does that reflect
[1:08:52] fellowship they're wanting protestant
[1:08:54] catholicism
[1:08:55] joining together which they are doing
[1:08:58] and will completely do
[1:08:59] and god reflected this to us in the moon
[1:09:02] of a total blackout
[1:09:03] by his mercy and grace he's showing is
[1:09:06] i believe it was the end of december at
[1:09:08] the end of december and then there was a
[1:09:10] there was a blackout and it made the
[1:09:12] headlines in the papers and they showed
[1:09:14] the phases of the moon many of you have
[1:09:15] seen that picture they show the phase
[1:09:17] and they show six pictures six phases of
[1:09:19] the moon
[1:09:20] but not a seventh because the seventh is
[1:09:22] totally blacked out
[1:09:23] and so that's what brother branham's
[1:09:25] referring to
[1:09:26] and that happened just before the pope
[1:09:28] went to jerusalem
[1:09:31] verse a paragraph 80. did any of you see
[1:09:34] the paper where they took the pictures
[1:09:36] of the moon
[1:09:36] i have it here if it ain't a perfect
[1:09:38] image leaving out the seventh age
[1:09:40] which is not yet exactly the way i
[1:09:42] drawed it by the holy spirit the church
[1:09:44] ages
[1:09:45] there's the six of them the seventh is
[1:09:47] not finished yet the six conditions of
[1:09:49] the moon
[1:09:50] now in its brightness in the first
[1:09:52] church age darkened the second
[1:09:54] third fourth fifth sixth just the way
[1:09:56] the holy spirit let me draw them on the
[1:09:58] board
[1:09:59] and then identified them with his self
[1:10:01] on the wall of the tabernacle
[1:10:03] two years ago the moon reflects itself
[1:10:06] and science again
[1:10:07] picks up the picture of the church ages
[1:10:09] just as they picked up that light yonder
[1:10:11] and put it in life magazine
[1:10:13] of the opening of the seals of the
[1:10:15] revealing in the age of the seventh
[1:10:17] angel
[1:10:17] in the days of his ministry the seventh
[1:10:19] messenger the mysteries of god which all
[1:10:21] the mysteries has been
[1:10:23] along the ages should be revealed and
[1:10:25] made manifest
[1:10:26] it should be at that time and he did it
[1:10:28] his words don't fail
[1:10:30] isn't that a mysterious thing god
[1:10:32] drawing in the heavens the same thing
[1:10:34] that they hold
[1:10:35] some same god let me draw on the
[1:10:37] blackboard and then by himself that's
[1:10:40] three times
[1:10:40] he's perfectly identified it and just
[1:10:42] before the pope goes to jerusalem
[1:10:44] so when brother branham preached the
[1:10:46] church ages in the revelation of jesus
[1:10:48] christ series
[1:10:49] on the blackboard he drew those seven
[1:10:52] circles and he drew the various light
[1:10:54] and degrees as it fades out and comes
[1:10:56] back
[1:10:56] but then when he was done with that god
[1:11:00] moved the the pillar of fire moved to
[1:11:02] the back of the church and on the back
[1:11:04] wall of the church
[1:11:05] it flashed out the same thing that
[1:11:06] brother brenham had drawn on the board
[1:11:09] and then now it shows it in heavens
[1:11:11] through an eclipse of the moon
[1:11:13] only when god showed it in heaven in the
[1:11:14] clips of the moon
[1:11:16] at first it looks like they leave out
[1:11:18] the seventh and brother branham says
[1:11:19] that but later in all the other messages
[1:11:21] he said the seventh was totally blacked
[1:11:23] out it was there
[1:11:25] but you couldn't see it because it was a
[1:11:26] total blackout showing
[1:11:28] that the significance of the pope going
[1:11:30] to jerusalem
[1:11:31] trying to unite the eastern and western
[1:11:34] side trying to unite protestantism and
[1:11:36] catholicism
[1:11:37] showing that the church has now gone
[1:11:39] into total apostasy
[1:11:41] it's completely blacked out so so when
[1:11:44] god showed it in the heavens it was even
[1:11:45] different than brother branham showed on
[1:11:47] the board
[1:11:47] because when he showed it he showed a
[1:11:49] little light left in the church
[1:11:50] when god showed it he showed it was time
[1:11:52] now for the separation
[1:11:55] total blackout praise be to god
[1:11:59] verse paragraph 81 which that was the
[1:12:02] church the moon is the church represents
[1:12:04] the church
[1:12:04] and before the church the shadow of the
[1:12:06] world crosses the moon
[1:12:07] and the shadow of worldlyism is the
[1:12:09] shadow of worldliness
[1:12:11] worldly churches swept across to black
[1:12:13] out the entire light of the bible
[1:12:15] so what brother brahma is showing is the
[1:12:16] eclipse of the moon is actually the
[1:12:19] earth
[1:12:20] getting between the sun and the moon the
[1:12:22] moon was put there to reflect the light
[1:12:24] of the sun
[1:12:25] but when the earth moves in between it
[1:12:27] it cast a shadow
[1:12:28] and that was the picture of the eclipse
[1:12:30] that was shown in the newspaper
[1:12:32] and brother bram said when it's totally
[1:12:33] blacked out it's because the world
[1:12:35] completely covers the church the church
[1:12:38] is completely
[1:12:40] blacked out in worldliness and
[1:12:42] worldlyism amen and
[1:12:43] no longer reflecting the light of the
[1:12:45] sun which is the word
[1:12:49] worldlyism the shadow of worldlyness
[1:12:50] worldly churches swept across to black
[1:12:52] out the entire light of the bible
[1:12:54] the world got in the light of the
[1:12:56] reflection do you understand the world
[1:12:58] crossed in the light of the moon and
[1:13:00] blinded out the sun
[1:13:02] and the reflection of the moon that's
[1:13:03] supposed to be giving light to the earth
[1:13:05] it was blacked out and it come in and
[1:13:07] draw the pictures just exactly like it
[1:13:09] did by inspiration
[1:13:11] before it happened let's turn the page
[1:13:14] and go over to paragraph
[1:13:15] 94 page 18
[1:13:20] gross darkness blinding of israel for
[1:13:22] the lighting of the gentiles now the
[1:13:24] blinding
[1:13:25] of the gentiles is the lighting of
[1:13:26] israel it's just like the day and night
[1:13:28] one side gets darkness the other side
[1:13:30] gets light
[1:13:31] when the light comes over on the other
[1:13:32] side so the moon passing the way it did
[1:13:35] in the reflection of the darkness of the
[1:13:36] world
[1:13:37] blinding out its light is a reflection
[1:13:39] to us that the
[1:13:40] gentile church age is finished
[1:13:44] praise god the gentile church age
[1:13:48] is finished the church is making herself
[1:13:51] ready
[1:13:52] been making herself ready for a time
[1:13:54] it's time for the rapture
[1:13:57] amen praise the lord that's what that
[1:14:00] blackout means
[1:14:02] amen so that's what the moon represents
[1:14:04] so a lot of times the moon we say
[1:14:06] means the church we've got to we got to
[1:14:08] realize that moon represents the earthly
[1:14:10] church
[1:14:12] not the new jerusalem church because the
[1:14:14] new jerusalem church
[1:14:16] amen there's another scripture for her
[1:14:18] and that day the moon will shine
[1:14:20] at seven the moon will shine as the sun
[1:14:23] and the sun will shine seven times it's
[1:14:26] brightness so the moon is shining just
[1:14:28] like the sun
[1:14:29] and the sun in that time is shining and
[1:14:31] a seven-fold light of
[1:14:33] all the light of the seven churches put
[1:14:35] together and the moon is shining like
[1:14:36] the sun
[1:14:38] the full light comes to the church of
[1:14:41] the new jerusalem
[1:14:43] amen it's amazing brother venom is
[1:14:45] showing that the church goes in the
[1:14:47] total blackout
[1:14:48] total darkness but he's preaching shalom
[1:14:50] good morning
[1:14:52] gross darkness total darkness total
[1:14:54] possibly total blackout
[1:14:56] so he's he's not the reason he's
[1:14:58] preaching the message is shalom the
[1:15:00] message is not blackouts
[1:15:03] the message is not apostasy the message
[1:15:05] is not
[1:15:06] eclipsed the message is shalom so he's
[1:15:09] not trying to get you to
[1:15:11] the to be partaker in the blackout he's
[1:15:13] trying to get you to be a partaker in
[1:15:15] the shalom
[1:15:16] the good morning we're not part of the
[1:15:19] apostasy we're not part of the blackout
[1:15:21] we're not part of the gross darkness
[1:15:22] we're part of the good morning
[1:15:25] that's what this message is about
[1:15:26] because this message is to the elect and
[1:15:28] to the elect
[1:15:29] it's shalom praise god
[1:15:33] why is the church in darkness let's go
[1:15:36] back to
[1:15:37] page 17 and read paragraph
[1:15:41] 85 and 86 see before he went to
[1:15:44] jerusalem to block out its light
[1:15:46] or what access it does have what time
[1:15:48] position
[1:15:49] and what rights it has to shine now it's
[1:15:52] cutting it off
[1:15:53] altogether for the last age the seventh
[1:15:55] church age where she goes into darkness
[1:15:58] what a great thing the lord is telling
[1:16:00] us in everything it's never failed but
[1:16:01] what god
[1:16:02] in the heaven has declared it and told
[1:16:04] it looked to it and there has identified
[1:16:07] it and vindicated it that it is the
[1:16:08] absolute truth
[1:16:10] darkness this laodicean church age now
[1:16:13] when jesus which is the word in the
[1:16:14] laodicean church age was on the outside
[1:16:16] of the church knocking at the door
[1:16:18] trying to get in darkness gross darkness
[1:16:21] upon this people
[1:16:22] was the bible right they said amen
[1:16:25] when brother ben is showing if we could
[1:16:27] go and turn in our bibles to revelation
[1:16:30] chapter three
[1:16:31] if you could grab your bible and go to
[1:16:32] revelation chapter 3.
[1:16:35] and in chapter 3 verse 14 is going to
[1:16:38] bring in the laodicean church age
[1:16:40] and in the beginning of the laodicean
[1:16:41] church age he writes unto the angel the
[1:16:43] church of the laodiceans right
[1:16:46] but when we come to the end of the
[1:16:48] laodicean church age in verse 20
[1:16:50] it says behold i stand at the door and
[1:16:52] knock if any man hear my voice and open
[1:16:54] the door i will come into him
[1:16:56] and will sup with him and he with me and
[1:16:58] brother man takes the scripture and
[1:16:59] shows and says
[1:17:00] see at the end of the laodicean church
[1:17:03] age
[1:17:03] jesus christ is on the outside of the
[1:17:05] church knocking
[1:17:07] that's why they're in darkness because
[1:17:08] christ the word is not there
[1:17:11] there's no light there it's total
[1:17:13] darkness because at the end of the age
[1:17:15] he's on the outside of the church and
[1:17:16] docking
[1:17:19] that's how brother branham shows us
[1:17:20] those scriptures now let's turn the page
[1:17:23] over to page 18
[1:17:24] or sorry 19. let's read paragraph 96.
[1:17:30] what is light the vindicated spoken word
[1:17:33] of god
[1:17:34] outside of that there's no light see you
[1:17:36] can't lighten the earth with flashlights
[1:17:38] it takes god's word
[1:17:39] that's made manifest the sun and brother
[1:17:42] branham is referring
[1:17:44] uh brother branham is referring
[1:17:47] back to when god spoke the word
[1:17:51] and said let there be light but he said
[1:17:53] it wasn't light until the light come
[1:17:54] into manifestation
[1:17:57] it was spoken word but when it comes to
[1:17:58] manifestation it became light
[1:18:00] and there's been the word but when the
[1:18:01] word comes in the manifestation it's the
[1:18:03] light
[1:18:04] amen and when the church refuses that
[1:18:06] light and puts that light on the outside
[1:18:08] it is now in total darkness
[1:18:12] amen
[1:18:15] amen and that goes with our next
[1:18:16] question paragraph 96 also
[1:18:19] what is the light to the church
[1:18:22] amen what is the light to the church
[1:18:25] let's
[1:18:26] let's read paragraph 70. let's go back
[1:18:30] to page 14.
[1:18:35] this is what i was just referring to the
[1:18:38] son is the word of god
[1:18:39] in the beginning god said let there be
[1:18:40] light and when the manifested word of
[1:18:42] god
[1:18:43] when the word of god was manifested
[1:18:45] there was light
[1:18:46] first god spoke it what if it didn't
[1:18:48] manifest
[1:18:49] then it wasn't light yet but when he
[1:18:51] spoke it and then it was manifested
[1:18:53] vindicated
[1:18:54] his word was a vindicated light came
[1:18:56] into existence
[1:18:58] so it's a very simple principle he's
[1:18:59] showing when he spoke it it wasn't the
[1:19:01] light yet
[1:19:02] but when it come to manifestation then
[1:19:04] it became the light
[1:19:05] so when isaiah said a virgin shall
[1:19:07] conceive amen it wasn't the light of the
[1:19:09] age yet
[1:19:11] but when mary conceived that became the
[1:19:15] light of the age
[1:19:16] now to reject that manifestation is to
[1:19:19] reject
[1:19:20] light amen
[1:19:24] this is the condemnation of the earth
[1:19:26] that light has come and men have loved
[1:19:27] darkness more than the light
[1:19:29] because jesus christ amen the it was
[1:19:32] a virgin shall conceive wasn't the light
[1:19:35] the virgin shall conceive was laying
[1:19:36] there so that when it came into
[1:19:38] manifestation
[1:19:38] that became the light
[1:19:42] so the the bible has prophesied of this
[1:19:45] day
[1:19:46] of a bride without spot or wrinkle a
[1:19:48] holy habitation of
[1:19:50] god a temple built out to be the
[1:19:51] tabernacle of the whole the temple of
[1:19:53] the holy ghost
[1:19:53] as prophesied of this day amen and when
[1:19:56] it comes to manifestation in the people
[1:19:58] on earth
[1:19:58] that's the light amen
[1:20:04] simple it's a simple concept but it's
[1:20:08] so super profound let's turn to
[1:20:11] page 17
[1:20:15] paragraph 87
[1:20:20] the perfection of the scripture glory of
[1:20:23] his great name the pope's visit was a
[1:20:25] sign of the church they just blackened
[1:20:27] out
[1:20:27] the manifested light of the world was
[1:20:29] the bible jesus said he was the light of
[1:20:31] the world
[1:20:32] the bible said that he is the word and
[1:20:34] the manifested or the vindicated
[1:20:36] scripture is the light
[1:20:39] we got it amen we got it let's turn over
[1:20:42] to
[1:20:44] page 21. it's going to be another
[1:20:47] lengthy reading but i want to read
[1:20:49] through this
[1:20:49] carefully uh let's start at paragraph
[1:20:52] 111
[1:20:53] page 21. now i say to the church
[1:20:56] shalom god's peace peace
[1:21:00] every true hebrew now he he has spent
[1:21:03] all of his sermon till now showing gross
[1:21:05] darkness
[1:21:07] showing apostasy black out of the moon
[1:21:09] but now he's turning now he says
[1:21:11] he's really getting to his message to
[1:21:13] the church and his message to the elect
[1:21:15] lady
[1:21:15] is shalom peace every true hebrew when
[1:21:19] he meets one another shalom other words
[1:21:21] good morning
[1:21:22] god be with you god's peace go with you
[1:21:24] it's a good morning how do you do
[1:21:26] it's breaking day church it's darkness
[1:21:28] upon the people
[1:21:29] but it's good morning to the church
[1:21:31] christ is appearing among
[1:21:33] us hallelujah
[1:21:37] shalom peace hallelujah shalom
[1:21:40] when we see darkness settling darkness
[1:21:42] just before day
[1:21:44] we know that the morning star is hanging
[1:21:46] yonder to introduce the coming sun
[1:21:48] it's that's when the morning star shines
[1:21:51] it's the going between
[1:21:53] it's always dark as just a few minutes
[1:21:55] before day
[1:21:56] the blackout comes the moon fails to
[1:21:58] shine the darkest before day is because
[1:22:00] the light is pressing the darkness
[1:22:02] but the morning star comes out and says
[1:22:04] good morning shalom
[1:22:07] that's him among us his word being
[1:22:09] identified shalom
[1:22:11] the great day is fixing to break when
[1:22:13] the morning breaks eternal bright and
[1:22:15] fair
[1:22:15] when his chosen one shall gather to
[1:22:17] their home beyond the sky
[1:22:18] when the role is called up yonder i'll
[1:22:20] be there our names are on his book
[1:22:22] we'll be there shalom good morning peace
[1:22:25] unto you
[1:22:27] the darkness is separating itself from
[1:22:28] the light god's
[1:22:30] causing it the light's doing it
[1:22:34] you realize the light is what's pressing
[1:22:37] the darkness
[1:22:38] but the baptism says another place the
[1:22:40] darkness is congealing itself together
[1:22:42] or it's condensing itself together and
[1:22:44] he says we'll read it here in a minute
[1:22:46] he says the darkness is darkening
[1:22:49] it's becoming darker what's doing it the
[1:22:52] light's doing it
[1:22:54] so so in jesus day when that light come
[1:22:57] amen the old church order
[1:22:58] the darkness darkened to persecute jesus
[1:23:02] christ
[1:23:03] the darkness darkness because the light
[1:23:05] was pressing it together
[1:23:07] the light was pressing pharisees and
[1:23:09] sadducees and herodians together
[1:23:12] amen and in the day that brother branham
[1:23:14] was here shining the light
[1:23:15] they started the ecumenical council
[1:23:18] while brother branham was here
[1:23:19] they started the world council of
[1:23:20] churches while he was in his ministry
[1:23:22] and they started the ecumenical move in
[1:23:23] vatican 2.
[1:23:24] why because he was a shining light and
[1:23:26] that light was pressing
[1:23:28] the protestant catholics together
[1:23:31] and now there's a bright shining light
[1:23:33] on the earth it's christ
[1:23:34] in the form of his bride and as that
[1:23:37] begins to shine brighter and brighter
[1:23:39] it'll move the darkness closer and
[1:23:41] closer together
[1:23:42] and we will see more and more alignment
[1:23:45] between protestants and catholics and
[1:23:46] churches coming together
[1:23:49] and when you see darkness darkening and
[1:23:51] you see the churches combining
[1:23:53] themselves together
[1:23:54] and more of a fellowship you know it's
[1:23:56] because you're shining the light
[1:23:58] because it's the light that's doing it
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] the darkness is being pushed because of
[1:24:04] the light
[1:24:07] darkness is separating itself we're in
[1:24:09] paragraph 114 darkness is separating
[1:24:11] itself from the light god's causing it
[1:24:13] the lights doing him
[1:24:14] see the lights pressing itself in such a
[1:24:16] way until the darkness has to congregate
[1:24:18] together
[1:24:19] they had a chance to accept it and they
[1:24:21] wouldn't do it so it's condensed itself
[1:24:23] and they do that by putting the church
[1:24:25] together in the council of churches and
[1:24:27] uniting it with pagan darkness
[1:24:29] when they so firmly disagree with one
[1:24:31] another but yet they had to go together
[1:24:33] to make the
[1:24:34] night come upon the people isaiah 61
[1:24:37] says arise and shine for the light has
[1:24:39] come to you
[1:24:40] rise and shine the light has come the
[1:24:42] word light is vindicated again
[1:24:45] the light vindicated again god's word
[1:24:48] so that you can see god manifested in
[1:24:52] his promise of the light of the day
[1:24:54] or the word given to this age see this
[1:24:57] these promises that's made for this day
[1:25:01] these promises that was said by the
[1:25:03] prophets and by jesus himself
[1:25:05] in this day god and sunday times hebrew
[1:25:07] one god in sunday times in diverse
[1:25:09] manners
[1:25:10] spake to their fathers through the
[1:25:11] prophets but in the last days through
[1:25:13] his son
[1:25:14] jesus christ are we in the last days
[1:25:18] then how will he speak through his son
[1:25:20] jesus christ
[1:25:21] who is the revealed word for the age
[1:25:24] who's been spoken where
[1:25:25] it's becoming life in a bride
[1:25:30] the great light that hung in the
[1:25:32] wilderness which was that moses forsook
[1:25:34] egypt esteemed the reproach of christ
[1:25:36] greater treasure than that of egypt the
[1:25:38] same one that met saul on the road to
[1:25:40] damascus
[1:25:41] a great light hung before him that same
[1:25:44] light
[1:25:44] same pillar of fire saul being a hebrew
[1:25:46] would never worship any spirit or
[1:25:48] anything or call it lord
[1:25:50] in the position he was in he said lord
[1:25:52] who are you he said i'm
[1:25:53] jesus jesus said i come from god and i
[1:25:56] go to god
[1:25:58] what was that light he said i'm jesus
[1:26:01] now brother ben is referring to that
[1:26:02] same light the one moses met
[1:26:04] the one who led the children in egypt
[1:26:07] and the exodus
[1:26:08] the one that paul met on the road to
[1:26:09] damascus and now he says that same
[1:26:12] light has come and that light is who
[1:26:15] jesus that same light has come to what
[1:26:19] to manifest to make known to the people
[1:26:21] the promises that he's made for this day
[1:26:24] manifested light of the day the darkness
[1:26:26] is darkened
[1:26:28] when he come he was the light of the day
[1:26:30] there was supposed to come a messiah and
[1:26:32] he come just
[1:26:33] exactly like god said he did would come
[1:26:36] and when he did
[1:26:37] what was he the light of the day and it
[1:26:40] pressed the darkness so against him
[1:26:42] sees that right he had to give his life
[1:26:44] that the light continued could shine
[1:26:46] he was the light of the day but why why
[1:26:48] was he the light of the day
[1:26:50] he was the vindicated word that had been
[1:26:53] spoken
[1:26:53] made manifest so what made him the light
[1:26:57] of the day
[1:26:58] he was the vindicated word that had been
[1:27:00] spoken made
[1:27:01] manifest so the light of the day is the
[1:27:04] vindicated word that's been spoken
[1:27:06] made manifest hallelujah friends
[1:27:11] that should make us all excited
[1:27:15] that's why the scripture says arise and
[1:27:16] shine who
[1:27:19] you for thy light has come
[1:27:22] god said over this dark gloomy dismal
[1:27:25] mossy world that stood here without
[1:27:27] light
[1:27:27] he said let there be light and it wasn't
[1:27:29] light until the word was manifest then
[1:27:32] it was light so the word made manifest
[1:27:35] is light let's go down to paragraph 124
[1:27:38] they said we know not whence thou comest
[1:27:40] we are moses disciples
[1:27:41] he said if you were moses disciples you
[1:27:43] would know me for moses wrote of me see
[1:27:46] he was the manifestation he was the
[1:27:48] vindication of the spoken word of god
[1:27:50] by moses and today that we're now living
[1:27:54] in
[1:27:54] god has come on the scene to vindicate
[1:27:56] and prove his promises
[1:27:58] so it's the light of the hour so we can
[1:28:01] rise and shine
[1:28:03] so why did the word come and get
[1:28:04] vindicated it came to be the light of
[1:28:06] the hour
[1:28:07] so we can rise and shine
[1:28:10] amen the light shines upon us again
[1:28:13] today the word is being made manifest
[1:28:15] it's the light praise be the god
[1:28:23] let's go down here to the bottom of the
[1:28:24] paragraph 135
[1:28:26] you can walk in that light you can't
[1:28:28] walk in that light you baptist he's
[1:28:29] referring back to john the baptist
[1:28:32] this is the light of the hour the light
[1:28:34] has come
[1:28:35] rise and shine the word light word the
[1:28:38] manifested word of god
[1:28:39] identified is a light so you see the
[1:28:43] theme brother branham is bringing he's
[1:28:44] telling us what the light is
[1:28:46] but the light is not in the church
[1:28:48] anymore because the moon the earthly
[1:28:49] churches went into total apostasy
[1:28:51] now the light has gone into the bride
[1:28:54] the elect lady
[1:28:57] all right what does the morning star
[1:29:00] testify of
[1:29:02] this is interesting in here and i want
[1:29:03] to look at this for a minute if we can
[1:29:05] back up
[1:29:07] to paragraph 112. on page 21.
[1:29:11] we'll catch this just real briefly here
[1:29:17] page 21 paragraph 112. when we see
[1:29:20] darkness settling darkness just before
[1:29:22] day we know that the morning star is
[1:29:24] hanging on or to introduce the coming
[1:29:26] sun
[1:29:27] so the morning star introducing the
[1:29:29] coming sun
[1:29:33] that it's when it's that's when the
[1:29:35] morning star shines
[1:29:37] it's the going between between what
[1:29:40] between night and day
[1:29:41] between dark and light the morning stars
[1:29:43] the going between
[1:29:45] it's always darkest just a few minutes
[1:29:47] before day the blackout comes the moon
[1:29:49] fails to shine
[1:29:50] the darkness before day is because the
[1:29:51] light is pressing the darkness
[1:29:53] so the blackout comes the moon fails to
[1:29:56] shine when's the moon fail to shine
[1:29:57] at the end of the legacy in church age
[1:29:59] the moon fails to shine that's when the
[1:30:01] morning star has to arise
[1:30:02] to let to introduce the morning
[1:30:07] the darkest before day is because the
[1:30:09] light is pressing the darkness
[1:30:10] but the morning star comes out and says
[1:30:12] good morning shalom
[1:30:15] who's preaching this message
[1:30:19] who's saying good morning shalom
[1:30:22] the morning star the one representing
[1:30:26] the morning star because we're going to
[1:30:27] find out the morning star is christ
[1:30:28] but it's christ in the forerunner
[1:30:32] but the morning star comes out and says
[1:30:34] good morning shalom
[1:30:36] that's him among us who's that the
[1:30:38] morning star
[1:30:40] that's him among us his word being
[1:30:42] identified
[1:30:43] shalom the great day is fixing to break
[1:30:46] when the morning breaks eternal bright
[1:30:48] and fair
[1:30:49] now let's go over here to paragraph 132
[1:30:53] on page 23.
[1:30:58] now john the baptist was the light of
[1:31:00] the hour he was the light before jesus
[1:31:03] was the light
[1:31:05] he was the light before jesus was light
[1:31:07] so what was he he was a forerunner
[1:31:10] he was a forerunner light showing that a
[1:31:12] greater light was coming
[1:31:13] and when that greater light come he had
[1:31:15] to diminish so
[1:31:17] so that the greater light could rise
[1:31:20] sounds like something brother branham
[1:31:21] said
[1:31:23] amen let's look at paragraph
[1:31:26] 136 down here now what about the new
[1:31:29] year that we're facing we could have
[1:31:31] more to say on this
[1:31:32] in between from darkness to light to
[1:31:34] introducing the light coming between
[1:31:36] but now we want to get right straight to
[1:31:38] the new year
[1:31:40] so now when when the moon fails to shine
[1:31:43] which was shown in an eclipse of the
[1:31:45] moon when the pope went to jerusalem
[1:31:47] because jerusalem represents
[1:31:48] the church the pope going to the old
[1:31:51] church represents the church
[1:31:52] going into complete apostasy blacked out
[1:31:55] on the moon
[1:31:56] no more light now in the in between
[1:31:58] between
[1:31:59] darkness and light between night and day
[1:32:01] there has to be a morning star come up
[1:32:03] or a forerunner light and what is the
[1:32:06] morning star
[1:32:07] it's him among us it was jesus christ
[1:32:10] working through the prophet
[1:32:13] but remember when brother eugene braun
[1:32:15] was here he said in jesus day
[1:32:17] you had the forerunner and the thing
[1:32:19] that he four run came in two separate
[1:32:21] vessels
[1:32:23] but in brother branham's day the
[1:32:24] forerunner and the thing he would
[1:32:26] forerun was the coming of the bride to
[1:32:28] maturity
[1:32:29] happened in the same vessel because
[1:32:32] brother branham was not
[1:32:33] just malachi 4 he was not just elijah
[1:32:36] the forerunner
[1:32:37] for running before running a second
[1:32:39] coming he was also the wave chief
[1:32:41] of the thing he four ran which was the
[1:32:44] bride coming in the maturity the first
[1:32:46] part of the harvest to come to full
[1:32:47] maturity
[1:32:48] happened it was the word coming to
[1:32:50] maturity but the word came to maturity
[1:32:52] in that same vessel
[1:32:54] and it was plucked up and waved before
[1:32:56] the people
[1:32:58] right so the the morningstar light
[1:33:02] was showing the light that was coming
[1:33:05] in the wave sheath good morning
[1:33:09] the morning star said good morning
[1:33:11] shalom brother branham come and preach
[1:33:13] good morning shalom showing where the
[1:33:16] morning star was
[1:33:18] and what's he announcing he's announcing
[1:33:21] the morning
[1:33:22] the sun's coming up that's what should
[1:33:25] make us so happy because we've seen the
[1:33:26] morning star
[1:33:28] that means the sun's come up that means
[1:33:31] this is a new day
[1:33:32] that means arise and shine for thy light
[1:33:34] has come
[1:33:35] the glory of the lord has risen upon
[1:33:37] thee
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:41] all right let's go to this this is a
[1:33:42] quick one this last one what did they
[1:33:44] hate jesus for
[1:33:45] let's go paragraph 154. on page 26
[1:33:51] paragraph 154
[1:33:54] it says what did they hate jesus for
[1:33:55] they called him beelzebub because he was
[1:33:57] the word
[1:33:59] and the word can discern the thoughts
[1:34:01] that's in the heart
[1:34:02] they hated him why did they hate jesus
[1:34:05] because he was the word
[1:34:08] if he was the word then she has to be
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:13] the word so he said if the if the
[1:34:15] bridegroom was the word the bride has to
[1:34:17] be the word
[1:34:19] if he was the word they hated him then
[1:34:22] if she comes she has to be the word
[1:34:27] then if she's the word they hate her why
[1:34:29] because the word can discern the
[1:34:31] thoughts and intents that's in the heart
[1:34:33] because the word is exposing
[1:34:37] the corruption of the whole system the
[1:34:40] word
[1:34:41] was exposing the false religion the
[1:34:43] world
[1:34:44] the word was exposing amen that those
[1:34:46] religious leaders were white sepulchers
[1:34:49] they had dead men's bones on the inside
[1:34:51] that there was no life in that system
[1:34:52] and jesus was demonstrating
[1:34:54] and exposing the system what do you
[1:34:58] think the bride's been called to do
[1:34:59] the same thing expose that system and
[1:35:02] when god begins to rise up and more
[1:35:04] manifestation her to expose that system
[1:35:06] what do you think the religious world is
[1:35:08] going to think about that
[1:35:11] amen amen
[1:35:15] because the word can cut to the moral
[1:35:17] and the bone and
[1:35:18] separate and show the fallacy
[1:35:22] who else knows who else on the earth
[1:35:25] knows
[1:35:26] where the apostasy is who else
[1:35:29] knows where the false you know the
[1:35:31] church went in the blackout who else
[1:35:33] knows
[1:35:34] who else can expose it all praise god
[1:35:38] i want to make one other little point
[1:35:40] here if you could turn with me to
[1:35:41] paragraph 146 on page 25.
[1:35:45] this is one thing i want to emphasize it
[1:35:47] wasn't one of the questions i had but i
[1:35:48] want to emphasize it before we part
[1:35:52] you know we we talked about and and i've
[1:35:55] been sharing with you some of my burden
[1:35:56] and what i've been sensing and feeling
[1:35:58] and also that god has been doing some
[1:36:01] some things among us
[1:36:02] some supernatural things among us i i
[1:36:05] sit in a vantage point where i get to
[1:36:06] hear you know people having dreams and
[1:36:08] things that are happening that are
[1:36:10] supernatural in their lives i've had
[1:36:11] some
[1:36:12] supernatural experiences from very acute
[1:36:14] experiences
[1:36:15] here in the last couple of weeks but
[1:36:17] when that begins to happen and we know
[1:36:19] what the prophet said is going to happen
[1:36:20] and we know
[1:36:21] what kind of manifestation should be in
[1:36:23] the bride i thought that would be a good
[1:36:25] time to read through this paragraph 146.
[1:36:29] patient patience
[1:36:33] some of us get so some of us gets in
[1:36:36] such a hurry i think a mini a good man
[1:36:39] has done that
[1:36:40] you get in too much of a hurry you want
[1:36:42] to see you want to do it yourself
[1:36:45] all right we read the quotes brother ben
[1:36:48] read some
[1:36:49] some of the quotes we know what's coming
[1:36:51] and we know what the bride must manifest
[1:36:54] well you've seen manifest temporarily
[1:36:55] she'll be manifesting the fullness of
[1:36:57] its power
[1:36:57] but i think this is a good thing to hold
[1:36:59] in our minds right now
[1:37:01] i think this should be posted on our
[1:37:03] refrigerators right now
[1:37:05] so that we're careful a minister
[1:37:08] brethren you know
[1:37:09] from when i'm talking you that's
[1:37:11] listening to this tape i'm not talking
[1:37:13] to you not only to the little
[1:37:14] congregation here
[1:37:15] but men around the world many men go out
[1:37:18] and patient
[1:37:19] but believing that the time is near you
[1:37:21] try to do something within yourself
[1:37:23] wait upon the lord patience is virtue
[1:37:26] you can have
[1:37:27] patience if you can have patience it's
[1:37:29] virtue now think about this
[1:37:32] virtue means what strength
[1:37:35] if you can have patience it's strength
[1:37:39] what makes you strong when you have
[1:37:41] patience
[1:37:43] if you can have patience it's virtue
[1:37:45] it's virtue if
[1:37:46] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:37:48] their strength
[1:37:49] what did he say strength wait upon the
[1:37:52] lord
[1:37:52] renew what virtue the same word
[1:37:56] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:37:57] their strength not they that try to get
[1:38:00] ahead of the lord
[1:38:01] they that tried to tell the lord lord i
[1:38:03] know you want me to do this and
[1:38:04] glory to god don't do that wait upon the
[1:38:07] lord the bible said
[1:38:09] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:38:11] their strength
[1:38:12] god took thousands of years to fulfill
[1:38:14] his promise of coming savior
[1:38:16] but remember he noted all the time when
[1:38:19] it was coming
[1:38:21] let's jump over to paragraph 160 on page
[1:38:28] 27.
[1:38:30] we are creatures of time he's god of
[1:38:32] eternity we try to press ourselves we
[1:38:35] try to make something different
[1:38:36] oh this has got to be done remember he
[1:38:38] knows all about it
[1:38:39] it's going to happen anyhow let him do
[1:38:42] it just commit yourself to him
[1:38:45] there you go god's going to do it every
[1:38:47] gift every manifestation
[1:38:49] everything the spirit's going to do he's
[1:38:51] going to do it he's got a time for it's
[1:38:53] going to happen
[1:38:53] what can you do just commit yourself to
[1:38:56] him
[1:38:57] just be consecrated be prayerful be
[1:39:00] dedicated
[1:39:01] and let god do what he's going to do but
[1:39:02] don't get ahead of time because at a
[1:39:04] time like this when we sense a
[1:39:05] transition
[1:39:06] and things spiritually are picking up
[1:39:08] that's a time that the devil would love
[1:39:10] to come in and bring fanaticism
[1:39:14] and start instead of the perfect he
[1:39:16] would like to get the somewhat perfect
[1:39:18] or
[1:39:18] are a little bit flawed so we begin to
[1:39:20] lose confidence in the gifts
[1:39:22] and begin to begin to lose confidence in
[1:39:25] the outpouring of the spirit
[1:39:27] and the gifts and the manifestations so
[1:39:29] this is the time just to be patient
[1:39:30] we all sense it things are changing
[1:39:32] things are happening but be patient
[1:39:34] so that when it happens it's exactly
[1:39:36] solid and right
[1:39:38] and builds faith because if
[1:39:41] if you start to say you know i had a
[1:39:43] dream and it means this and this and
[1:39:44] this and you tell a bunch of people and
[1:39:46] that never happens
[1:39:47] people just lost faith or
[1:39:50] the lord told me this and this and that
[1:39:52] doesn't happen what happens
[1:39:54] we lose faith so we've got to be careful
[1:39:57] that this is the time we're patient
[1:39:59] and when god does it it's exact it's
[1:40:02] solid
[1:40:03] it happens and then our faith increases
[1:40:07] up and up and up
[1:40:09] so this is a good time when we've heard
[1:40:11] all that we've heard preached
[1:40:12] and we feel what we're feeling this is a
[1:40:14] good time to remember what the prophet
[1:40:16] said
[1:40:17] god's going to do it when he do it does
[1:40:19] it it's a sure thing
[1:40:22] let's go to paragraph 158
[1:40:26] right over here on page 26 bottom page
[1:40:30] 26.
[1:40:32] i just want to read this to you
[1:40:36] just exactly like he showed us the seven
[1:40:38] church ages what would come just exactly
[1:40:40] what he showed us what would come
[1:40:42] when he set that light up there in
[1:40:44] revelation to it
[1:40:45] to show the world when he sent the seven
[1:40:48] angels to reveal the seven
[1:40:49] messengers that had been down there
[1:40:51] through there and show the loose ends
[1:40:53] each angel coming each day and revealing
[1:40:56] the loose ends that luther left
[1:40:57] wesley left pentecost left and all
[1:41:00] represented in there
[1:41:01] and in the very type and shadow of the
[1:41:03] great shalom jehovah yahweh
[1:41:05] exactly throwed it in the skies and
[1:41:07] there's the mechanical eye taking a
[1:41:09] picture of it see
[1:41:11] thank the lord he's talking about the
[1:41:13] picture of the cloud
[1:41:14] over sunset mountain look what he says
[1:41:16] now shalom
[1:41:18] peace don't be weary jesus is here
[1:41:24] what did that show that showed that
[1:41:26] jesus is here
[1:41:28] the headship has come to the body when
[1:41:31] when brother bam took that picture and
[1:41:32] turned it to the right he said see
[1:41:34] it's our lord that's our lord up there
[1:41:38] don't be weary jesus is here
[1:41:41] his great light has come to us and we're
[1:41:43] thankful for it yes his word
[1:41:45] the great mystery here he is today
[1:41:47] manifesting himself doing the same
[1:41:49] as he did then just the same doing the
[1:41:52] very same thing
[1:41:54] don't worry what does that cloud
[1:41:56] represent
[1:41:57] the headship is here don't worry
[1:42:00] everything's ticking just right on time
[1:42:02] we sense it
[1:42:03] we feel it things are shifting he's
[1:42:06] bringing us higher
[1:42:08] but don't worry he's right on time you
[1:42:10] don't have to push
[1:42:12] we don't want the prod we don't the
[1:42:13] force just be patient
[1:42:15] if we can be patient it's virtue to us
[1:42:18] if we can be patient it's strength
[1:42:21] everything he said is going to happen
[1:42:24] do you believe that let's all stand
[1:42:28] musicians if you can come brother ben if
[1:42:29] you can make your way up
