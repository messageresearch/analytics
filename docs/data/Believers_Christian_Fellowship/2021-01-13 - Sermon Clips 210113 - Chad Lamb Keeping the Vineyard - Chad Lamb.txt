TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when philip needed to get from one place to another to to call out a predestinated seed he could walk down there but when he was done he could vanish and disappear and show up hundreds of miles away why because that was the need for the hour amen in the manifested word for the hour will take care of itself we just need to stick in the vineyard stay with the word have confidence in what god has given us quit trying to figure things out we need to i say we need to stay off youtube unless you're watching sermons and stay in the word the hours that are spent chasing conspiracy theories the economy is failing they're going to take away paper money so what i said this one time so you figured out the illuminati's behind it all right what does that change did it change your life did it protect you or somehow you immune to what's happening next it means nothing i figured this plot and it's this one and it's that one it means nothing it changes nothing it gives you no power to overcome all it does is bring fear and tension and anxiety and now you know there's there's a secret society that's out to ruin everybody but you have no power to do a thing about it who cares but i know a secret that almost nobody else in the world knows and i didn't get it from an alternate news site i didn't get it from youtube i didn't get it from the dark web i tell you where i got this secret i got it from the message of the hour and that secret tells me that just when he's about to accomplish their cowardly plot amen he'll gather the wheat into the garner and that secret is what's keeping me friends i know a secret do you know a secret that's the only secret you need to know amen stay with the word stay in the vineyard be happy be free enjoy what god has given us amen and he'll take care of the rest we should be a happy people of free people amen not caught up in anxieties and fears this has all been told to us
