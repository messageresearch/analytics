[0:01] everybody else got married and I'm still
[0:02] not married it's not fair How can there
[0:05] be not fair with God tell me how that's
[0:09] possible everybody else gets to have a
[0:11] family but I don't get to have a family
[0:13] amen it's not right how is there
[0:14] anything out of kilter with God how can
[0:17] he fail how can he not be a good
[0:20] shepherd how can he forget about us how
[0:22] can his plan for us be disrupted how can
[0:25] the things that he's predestinated not
[0:27] come to pass amen right
[0:30] [Music]
[0:32] the devil wants us to look around and
[0:33] become
[0:35] dissatisfied and begin to want for
[0:37] things that are outside the boundaries
[0:39] of what God's allowed for our
[0:42] life at some point we need to turn our
[0:44] vision heavenward and say I have a
[0:47] heavenly father who watches over me I've
[0:50] got a god who's my daddy and he knows
[0:52] what I need and he'll give me everything
[0:54] according to his riches and
[0:57] Glory I have a husband bridegroom I I I
[1:01] have a provider I have a
[1:03] Shepherd I've got everything I need and
[1:07] if I need something else he'll provide
[1:08] that
[1:10] too I'll ask him and believe that he'll
[1:12] give it to me and if I ask believing
[1:14] I'll have it and if he says no I still
[1:16] believe it's right am and it either come
[1:19] later or I don't need it but I'm not
[1:21] going to quit trusting in
[1:23] Him let's take our eyes off of these
[1:26] carnal things and let's keep our eyes
[1:28] focused on our bridegroom
[1:31] because what's life a
[1:34] vapor a Mist soon it's
[1:38] over you're not we're not going to live
[1:40] here
[1:41] forever when you think about the the
[1:43] lifespan of a average human being it's
[1:46] over before you know it it's boom it's
[1:48] gone I was thinking the other day about
[1:51] something that God had done for me when
[1:53] when I had an appendix rupture inside of
[1:55] me and I didn't know what was happening
[1:58] I was laying in a in a a CT scan with my
[2:00] arms up over my head and they slid the
[2:02] tray back and I remember just saying God
[2:05] whatever path you want me to walk I'll
[2:08] walk I didn't know what he wanted but he
[2:11] supernaturally came on the scene and
[2:13] made sure I didn't need a surgery and
[2:15] delivered me from that and I started
[2:17] thinking when was that and I started
[2:19] doing some math and it was almost 20
[2:21] years ago I said it's
[2:24] impossible that was almost 20 years ago
[2:28] where does another 20 years put me
[2:30] and 20 years after that it was like that
[2:34] who cares about the car and the house
[2:37] and the relationship and the promotion
[2:40] and the
[2:41] [Music]
[2:42] vacation when it really put it in
[2:45] perspective he is all I
[2:47] need Christ is the only thing I need and
[2:51] he'll never fail me he'll never fail to
[2:56] be the
[2:57] shepherd I shall not
[3:02] want oh I say it because the Bible says
[3:05] it but now I'm saying it by Revelation I
[3:08] shall not want Chad Lamb is not going to
[3:12] come to a place of want because he's
[3:14] going to supply all of my needs
[3:15] according to his riches and Glory I'm
[3:18] not worried will I hit stressful times
[3:21] I'm sure but I shall not want
