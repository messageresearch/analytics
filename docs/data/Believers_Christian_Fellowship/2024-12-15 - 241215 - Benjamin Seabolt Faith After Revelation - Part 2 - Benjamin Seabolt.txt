once again we're grateful that we can make that Proclamation with a proper understanding and not just some figment of our imagination of what God would be that we would love but that we know that you are the revealed word father and it's the revealed word that we love so therefore we love the one and only true God lord we're so grateful that we can come this morning that we can worship you in spirit and in truth father not around a man's idea or even our own idea may we never take that for granted Lord that we're even Gathering and approaching the correct God and not a god of our imagination Lord we would just ask as we would come to this part of the service as we so often do Lord Lord we stand here as a mortal man task to do a supernatural thing and how full of ship would be to approach this moment thinking that we could do that father but there's those that would not be speaking this morning that would be hearing Lord and even your scripture says that we can't even hear but by the Lord say father we're asking that you would come this [Music] morning Lord that you would come and that you would be the speaker and that you would be the hearer for it's only if you will extend that Grace to us that anything will be accomplished here this morning Lord father if I had something to help the people I would most certainly give it I would most certainly say it I would most certainly do it Lord but you know know that I don't so we just ask that you would come now Lord that you would just set me aside and that you would accomplish what you want to accomplish here this morning Father we don't have an agenda this morning we we don't want to put you in a box and say that we that you have to do this or you have to do that or you have to do something a certain way Lord we we don't we don't have that agenda Lord our only prayer would be that this is not a service orchestrated by man Lord that this would not just be a sterile teaching father or a religious ceremony so we don't care how you do it father but we just pray that you would come and do the supernatural here this morning Lord and that you would change our lives to make us what you would have us be we just commit ourselves to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you this morning let's take our Bibles turn to Mark 11 I want to greet any visitors that we have with us this morning and don't feel bad if you're disappointed because our pastor not preaching I would be disappointed as well so I can't even hold hold it against you it's so bad that I pay him $100 just not to announce it that way people will still show up Mark 11 I want to go back I thought I was done with this topic that I touched on last time on faith after Revelation but became very clear to me over the last several hours that I was not but I didn't know what I was missing until this morning so I want to go back and and pick this up and move forward with this thought thought but it's still based here in Mark 11 beginning in verse 22 and Jesus answered and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God Amen for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you that whatsoever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them let's go let's go ahead and read this before we're seated let's go to Psalms 46 Psalms 46 and verse 10 be still and know that I am God God bless you as you would have your seats this morning you say that's funny to try to tie those two scriptures together one is saying speak and it shall be given to you the other one saying be quiet and know that I'm God how do you correlate that how do you tie that together Hebrews 11:6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of him of them that diligently seek him so if we're trying to please God scripturally speaking there's only one thing that we can do and that's to have faith because without faith we're never going to accompl accomplish that Luke 18:8 says I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless the son when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on Earth and we've mentioned this several times recently but we can see the emphasis that is placed on this the emphasis that is put on faith that it would be the one thing that Christ is looking for when he returns to earth he's not looking for multiple other manifestations although no doubt they would be there but he's cons he's looking for one specific thing upon his return now I want to read this quote again this is the quote that we read um the last time I'll have speak to this mountain and we've we've covered the events surrounding this situation we know this is the time period that the third pole begin to come into manifestation this was the junction of the changing of the prophet's Ministry and there were several events going on at this time there was the test that brother brandham had to pass with the young couple in the audience uh to grant them Mercy rather than to pack them out dead and there were I'm I'm been very very intrigued with this Junction of time uh the last several months there is so much laying in it um that I'm becoming aware of so I want to go back and I want to read this and I want to emphasize a different part but brother ranam is out in the woods and he's hunting and this scripture keeps coming to him he says it keeps pulling on me was the words that he used and that scripture came to me again said whatsoever you say believe that what you say shall come to pass and you can have what you say says well I thought why does that scripture keep coming to me when I can't preach on it because I don't know nothing about it just Overlook my emotions here this morning this was the missing piece I was after for about the last 36 hours so we have a prophet in the woods minding his own business trying to kill some squirrels and this scripture is pulling on him and pulling on him and he's so transparent and he's being so honest with God he's like he's asking God why are you pulling on me with that scripture I can't preach on that you know I can't preach on that what is the reason that he can't preach on it Saints is because he's admitting to God I don't know anything about that amen I can't go there I can't talk about about that if anybody ask me a question he has this little generic response that he had made up to you know get himself out of the out of the conversation but this Junction of time this turn of events this new ministry comes on the scene and the reason that it's coming on the scene is because there is a man on the scene who who has developed a character that he can be honest with God and he would be getting pulled on by a scripture a profound scripture a powerful scripture and instead of just jumping on that and taking off with his own ideas he would he would confess to God I why are you bothering me with this I can't do anything about it I don't know anything about this I just pray that that God will drop in your heart what he's dropped in my heart without the Saints the seventh seal cannot come into existence without this manifestation of character the program stops in Revelation 81 which is the seventh seal there is silence in heaven amen there is always silence proceeding the seventh seal and I don't want to box that in with that I'll say it this way there is always silence before a seventh seal manifestation amen always so the prophet in this situation he's just been honest and he's just communing with God but and maybe he realized that maybe he didn't I'm I'm prone to think that he didn't based on the statements that he's that he makes but inevitably God is remember this is God pulling on him with the scripture this is God wanting to turn a page this is God wanting to introduced the new ministry and inevitably brother brandom finds himself doing scripturally what must be done this story this event would not have transpired if his response to this scripture pulling on him would have been like oh yeah I've got some pretty good ideas on that great I think I've got a couple angles that I can talk about on that I see it you know in this way no this only moves forward when he confesses to God I don't know anything about that I cannot preach on that this is in 1959 November of 1959 almost a little over 3 years later this is the exact position that he finds himself when he comes to preach the seals why was he able to preach the seals why was the lamb able to come down step into a human vessel use his vocal cords and reveal the mysteries of God is because in November of 59 in the Woods by himself squirrel hunting he had the proper approach I don't know anything about this I can't preach on this I don't have any ideas yeah he finds himself now a little over 3 years later in a room with a series of meetings scheduled thousands of people there to stare at him and look at him and to tell us what the seals are and he has to come the the night before the first seal and he has to tell them I have no idea what the first seal is we we just so lightly take that put yourself in that position yeah right you have a worldwide Ministry you have thousands of people gathered you have a specific series and scriptures that you have proclaimed you're going to preach on and now as a man you have to stand there yeah and say oh by the way I have no idea how to preach what I've told you while I'm going to to preach I can't do it amen praise God we we so just lightly accept that we just so lightly read over that the turmoil that had to go along with this we just so lightly Overlook but the reason that he able to come to this point and come to this position is because this has been settled 3 years ago now he's entering in to this little room with his Bible with all these books of study and he is giving the most Gallant effort that he can give right and he's studying and he's praying and he's seeking God and he would come out and say even after all of that I about made a really really bad mistake today see this event of breaking out of humanity of breaking out of carnality I'm not talking even sin right this is not sinful this is a man studying like his life depends upon it this is a man giving everything that he has in a little room all to himself totally sold out to God seeking the answer to this question and yet and even approaching it with the right desire and the right motives with the right character and still the the pressure is so great and and the path is so twisting and so winding and so difficult that he still finds himself getting ready to inject man ID man's ID into it of what he thinks is the proper thing what he thinks is the right way to go right but what saved him Saints is because he had the proper character God knew that that he did not want to go with his own idea he was simply doing everything that he could this is the same position that he was on in when he was on the mountain and the storms moving in and to stand there is certain death you're going to freeze to death but his character comes forth and he admits Lord I thought I was a good Woodsman but I'm clearly not I have no idea what to do I have no which way to go so he confesses this there is this [Applause] silence he's admitting I've got nothing to say here I have no direction to go in here but I must do something this is the same situations the same places that he's finding himself in and he just confesses to God if I if I stand here at certain death I've got to do something so I'm going just to do the best that I know how and if I'm wrong you stop me the character development leading up to this event was years in the making Saints let's not just Overlook that and think this was a couple nights that brother brandham set himself aside in a little room for the Lord to come speak to him this was literally his life this started when he was born the tearing down the breaking down the dripping him away from any friends and relationships that he would have and drawing him only unto God this character was developed even from his youth that's right let's not get to the end of the story and just forget about everything that led up to it I'm not so certain but what the things leading up to it was more important that scripture came to me again whatsoever you say believe what you shall say shall come to pass and you can have what you say well I thought why does that keep scripture keep coming to me when I can't preach on it because I don't know nothing about it God responds he says do you think so this is God responding revealing the scripture to him do you think it was the prophets talking well I thought that's right if the person through the atonement Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ can live into a sphere with God so close that he can be wrapped so completely in God by the blood of Jesus that wouldn't be him talking it would be the Holy Spirit speaking those things so this scripture is pulling on him there is silence on his part I don't know nothing about this Lord what happens next a seventh seal manifest manifestation we're going to get to this in a minute but remember brother brandom says the seventh seal brings him back to Earth again Hallelujah so let's not think that the seventh seal was just a one night meeting topic that brother Brandon preached on the seventh seal brings God to Earth anytime that you see God coming back to earth that is a manifestation of the seventh seal and anytime you see that I challenge you to go search the scriptures and see if you don't find a moment of silence before that it is impossible for God to manifest himself on Earth or as shall I say in Earth that's right unless there is silence beforehand it is a must it is breaking the scriptures if there is not so he's silent on the topic admits Lord I have no idea to talk about that I cannot preach on that and immediately after this confession the Lord drops a thought in well do you think it was the prophet speaking the answer to the question immediately follows the silence one thought do you think it was the prophets talking well I thought that's right now that he has the answer he can see how it would work if it's through if that person through the atonement Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ can live into a sphere with God so close that he can be wrapped so completely in God by the blood of Jesus that wouldn't be him talking it would be the Holy Spirit speaking these things this is so profound to me it is so amazing to me how you can literally go from not having a clue about anything on a topic to having the answer to the topic am that's right in a moment's time how does that happen by being honest with God and saying Lord I don't know I'll tell you how it doesn't happen I think I can figure this out I think I can make this work I think I've got a work around I think I can explain this I'll tell you how it definitely won't work is I have to say something because what will the people think if I don't what will my spirituality level go to if I tell somebody I don't really know what that means I assure you that is a positive way to keep the seventh still from manifesting don't get hung up on that terminology remember the seventh seal was God returning to Earth want to keep God out of your life keep thinking you have the answer for everything keep answering all the questions never say I don't know and no more than I said that till the anointing of the Holy Spirit struck me like I've never had it in all my life God knows that I raised up to my feet I got scared something said to me now this is the beginning of your new ministry now ask what you will and it shall be given to you why now why now because a man could humble himself before God and say I don't know I don't know how that scripture works I don't even know why you keep pulling on me with it yeah now this is the beginning of your new ministry here's my question this morning and I'm going to repeat it several times as we go through some examples but I want you to tell me how brother brandham made God come give him that answer that was a dynamic event the third poll coming in manifestation the setting the stage for the seals to be loosed for the Thunders to be preached for Revelation 10:7 to be accomplished all of these things are hinging on this new ministry this Junction of time this turning of the corner and in an instant in a moment of time God just comes down and gives him the answer well do you think it was the prophet speaking oh well no it wasn't the prophet oh well if it wasn't the prophets that mean that if the person threw the atonement boom boom boom boom boom boom boom just lines right up for him how did he pull that down how did did he make that happen he didn't stand a chance God could have left him sitting out there in the woods for the rest of the day just pondering on this scripture just pulling on him with this scripture but the moment that that God starts pulling on him with this scripture and he has the appropriate response I don't know Lord I don't know I can't preach on it I don't know now the Dynamics can come down now the Dynamics can fall why is that because there was a mechanical approach to the Dynamics this was not brother Brandon sitting out in the woods wondering who's going to win the next football game this was not brother brandom you understand what I'm saying he's out there yielding himself to God pulling on him on a scripture he is approaching God mechanically he is quieting himself he's listening for the voice of God there's mechanics that were in play place there were a lifelong lifelong mechanics that were in place for this so we see a lot of times the Dynamics coming on the scene and we just focus on that part but what about before that what about before that what brought that on the scene so that's my question is how did Brother brandom do that the answer obviously is he didn't there is nothing that he could have done to answer that question even sitting there telling God I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know that is the proper approach that is how to uh encourage God to move on the scene but it still doesn't obligate him to move on the scene right this is God's grace this is God saying I'm going to reveal something this is God saying I'm going to do something and because all the mechanics are in place there is no hindrance to that I think I've said this here before but I just want to repeat it when we look at this event and this changing of the ministry keep in mind this is the third pull not the third push do not try to bring the third push on the scene it is called the third pull for a reason brother brandom says this scripture was pulling on me this was not him sitting out there looking at that scripture saying I got to I got to preach on that nobody else knows how that works I I I got to I got to no this was a scripture pulling on him pulling on him amen so God as we preached last time God is here and he's dealing with the prophet's faith and he's encouraging him into this new ministry to speak and it shall be given to thee right and he's encouraging him he's drawing in him drawing him into that and as we uh expounded on last time at the same time as soon as he does that he starts testing his faith by delaying the appearing of the squirrels by delaying it so he's doing multiple things at the same time here but God is also not just teaching him about his faith and to believe that and to accept this new juncture and this new ministry but God is also revealing to him Psalms 46:10 that we just read be still and know that I am God he's revealing to this he he is uh enforcing enforcing this to him that this is a requirement for this new ministry I think there's a reason brother brandom had that over the pulpit at the time Tabernacle because this is his ministry if he would have never been still we would have never known God there's I don't know that they knew all of that when they put that up there or who even put that over top of the pull pit but I think that it's fitting and I think there's a reason for that Saints we're never going to come to the truth of this message and the fullness of this message through our own ideas through our own ways through our own efforts do we have the answers yes but are the answers going to be made known to us in their fullness and in their power when we're still hanging on to ourselves it's not going to work in the scripture the seventh seal was preceded by silence in the prophet's Ministry it was preceded by silence and by silence I don't necessarily mean what we would think of like no noise but silence is just a meting when you don't have nothing to say so you can say I have nothing to say and you're actually making noise but you're being silent brother brandom both times of the manifestation of the squirrels as we touched on last time was anointed spoke the word and then gave up and walked away he was actually being silent he gave up he gave up and we would say that was kind of in a bad way and look I'm not here to criticize like God only knows what I would have done so I'm not saying this like I would have done better or I've got the answers here this this is not critical preaching but just grasp this for a minute even after the anointing even after speaking it even after having a couple manifestations of it coming to pass the fullness of what he spoke the totality of what he spoke did not come to pass until there was another point of Brokenness another point of giving up another point of saying yes Lord you've done all of that but okay that's enough I'm just going I'm going home now there's another point of Silence whenever the third squirrel didn't show up he wasn't there stomping his foot on a log or shaking his fist in the air saying show up show up show up you've got to show up show up now I command you no he's broken he's silent before God to the point that he knows if you don't make it happen I can't make it happen I'm just going on home as bad as that sounds and as bad as that is in our mind it's still way better than the other yeah amen what if he interjects himself there you see what's no big deal it's squirrels it wasn't squirrels this was the opening of the seals what if think about this he comes and he breaks the first seal breaks the second seal breaks the third third seal and he don't get an answer in the little room before it's time to preach the fourth seal you want to know what would have happened I can tell you what would have happened because he demonstrated it he would have closed the meeting and he would have went home right you say you can't do that you've got all these thousands oh no oh no he can do it and he would have done it because that's what he did in the woods this answer was already settled praise God the damage that would have been done by him interjecting his own ideas on any of these seals yeah right would have ruined the entire Redemptive plan of God I wonder if we would have the courage to do that I wonder if we would have the courage to do that to admit I won't even make it before thousands of people I'll just make it a couple couple people to admit you know what I'm just going to keep my mouth shut cuz I don't know I just don't know 1955 the approach to God brother brandom is relaying a healing event that he had a vision of and it's about a little baby being healed very very early in his ministry so the man picked up the little boy in his arms excitable and run him over to me watch How I move there I didn't come the provided approach I said bring him here and I got in myself because I seen the vision was going to make him well but you have to come God's approach see and they brought him over there and I just laid my hands on him I said God I pray that you'll make this little fellow well you said that you would do it and the little fella gased three three or four times and passed out completely and I looked at him and his mother began to scream oh he's dead he's dead he's dead this is back in 1955 that he's learned this lesson and I thought well what's happened oh I thought there it is oh there's GM Snelling standing here he's the blond head man that's supposed to be sitting there and the there with the the curly hair but there's supposed to be an old woman sitting in this chair here there was the furniture and everything but it wasn't right I didn't come the right approach and that woman wasn't supposed to be standing there by her husband she was supposed to be leaning against the door and I thought oh god I've killed that baby oh my and the father laid the baby down and she started screaming and crying and everything and I just stood there I thought oh my what have I done what have I done and I want and I waited just a little while and the baby just barely living he got worse right now and I thought oh if I have been the cause of that if I just obeyed what he told me to do this is back in 55 a vision of a little baby being healed is the vision true absolutely is the vision accurate absolutely is the vision going to come to pass absolutely but what happened a man got excited saw the end of the story wanted to skip a couple Pages yeah right I'll just say it like he said it I got into myself Saints if God is not going to come on the scene and heal a little baby dying gasping for its life and allow it to get worse because the seventh angel messenger got a little couple steps ahead of the program do you think he is going to rewrite his entire Redemptive plan because we won't let loose of our own ideas or get out of our own way do you think the seventh seal is going to do you think God is going to return to Earth and in Earth yes when we won't humbly come before him and say Lord I don't know I don't stand a chance help me to get out of my way it has to be the proper approach not just in the Visions not just in the healings but for the big picture for the big picture we can scream message all we want we can scream bride all we want if we can't come and be silent being silent doesn't even mean you don't have the answer you may have the answer to the question you're simply forbidden to speak it amen we've got to be in tune with Christ we've got to be in tune with God to not only tell the truth but tell the truth at the appropriate time and tell the truth in the appropriate way this principle is so simple but it's so found there was a dynamic movement at the healing of this baby but it came after the prophet repented and after he put the appropriate mechanics in place the woman had to be standing and leaning against the door there had to be a man setting here there had to be a hat laying here and then Mark 11 comes into play then he can stand there and say do you still have faith in me as a sermon of Christ the man says yes then bring me the baby why because of the approach to God because of the silence if you go back and you read that story brother brandham sits down in a chair by the door and just shuts up right amen and that wasn't an easy thing to do because it got to the point brother Snelling had to go to work and he starts getting excited oh Lord but if he goes to work he's not going to be here the vision can't and then the little woman comes walking up the back door his frustrations didn't change anything him being silent is what changed things so just because we get flustered and we get excited and we have things pressing on us that doesn't move God Amen right right y y what moves God is when we'll acknowledge those things they are what they are I'm still keeping my mouth shut because regardless of how much it presses and how much it pulls and how excited I get I can't do anything any he right true my emotional unrest and my emotional distress is not going to cause God to come on the scene what's going to cause God to come on the scene is when I pass the test and I hush my mouth and I allow him to come on the scene when he chooses to come on the scene in the way that he chooses to come on the scene how he wants to come on the scene Hebrews 4:9 says there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that is entered into his rest he Oh you mean there's something that has to happen before that he also hath ceased from his own works we so often desire the rest but we're still doing our own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest let us labor mechanics amen but don't try to make the mechanics the Dynamics the Dynamics is answer to the problem the Dynamics is the seventh seal Christ coming on the scene don't try to sub The Mechanics for the Dynamics do the mechanics the mechanics is ceasing from your own works the mechanics is not fixing the problem yeah that's the Dynamics and God can even use you to do the Dynamics but it's not you and your works it's God God doing it you say well that's confusing if I'm doing it how God would tell the children of Israel don't you all make a Graven image and then he would come tell Moses hey go make a Graven image how does that work because it wasn't Moses doing it you say it was Moses doing it yes it was Moses doing it but it wasn't Moses doing it God told them don't you don't you make a Graven image that's right but if God tells you to make a grave in ebbage it's not you doing it now it's God doing it big difference he would tell them don't you all mix these oils and don't you do this don't and then he would come and say hey you all go mix some oils and pull it over pour it over Aaron who mixed the oils the men did amen who was mixing the s [Applause] God don't you all do this don't you all do this don't you all mechanically go and do this but when he tells them to do it it's not them doing it you say that's a paradox it is a paradox I wish I had the vocabulary to break it down to you and make you understand how that works but I don't am but there's a big difference of God doing something and man doing something yeah amen and if we'll approach God the right way Saints if we will approach him the right way with an honest and a pure heart I believe that he will reveal to us amen hey this is you trying to do something how many's had God do something in your life that you know you didn't do once that happens not saying beforehand but once God's Grace has ever extended into your life that one time just that one for me it just took one time to watch him do something that I knew I didn't have a hand in it and could have never done in a million years once I saw him do that one time every time that I've tried to do something myself now there it's just a flying the biscuit as brother R says there just something you know you know something's wrong you know that's right amen when that happens Saints don't keep pushing pull pull back pull back get out of the way yeah that's right now before he does that like we're just ignorant to the fact I I'm not even going to preach critical on that because I've been there done it I did it for years I was an expert at pushing and making things happen and there was always a little hiccup in it like it worked it happened but it just didn't fit you know am and then ultimately there's trouble at the end right but one time God in his Mercy coming down and doing something that I could then look at and say I did not do that no no no never in a million years could I have done that once that page is turned now you have something to check it by amen now you know clearly how it works when you're not involved right and when you start getting involved you feel that hesitation you feel that Kickback you feel this is this is not working and here's the funny part about this is everything can be going wrong and it can be the hardest trial of your life and the hardest situation of your life and I mean a struggle Beyond struggle but somehow you know it's easy it's just working everything is going but you know you're not doing it and if this was a situation to where it was just you trying to do something you'd have tapped out a long time ago and be like it ain't even worth it I give up but now you can have a situation that's even harder than all of that harder than the situation that you forced through and made happen but it's somehow easier in your spirit realm in your soul in your mind everything is okay it's just working how is that why is that it's the scripture being manifested it's the seventh seal working it's the approach to God working it's the mechanics being put in place so the Dynamics could fall you realize once the Dynamics come on the scene it doesn't matter how hard the situation is because the mechanics are in place for it you can have a rock that you can not budge by yourself it's a th000 lb Rock and you within yourself cannot move that rock but now when a Superduty truck pulls up up turbo diesel no doubt and hooks on to the Rock the Dynamics are on the scene right the mechanics were in place when you admitted I can't move the rock I need something else to move the rock once the truck shows up the problem solved I know that's a really simple analogy but I hope you can see now let's go spiritual with it when he shows up to do the Dynamics it doesn't matter anymore how much the struggle was it doesn't even matter the situation when he is on the scene the problem solved even even if the truck has to be put in four-wheel drive in low gear maybe some stuff put under the tires so that they don't spin it doesn't matter like it's going to work right the problem is solved but if you keep standing there shoving on that rock and not calling your buddy to bring the truck it's not going to move it's the same thing spiritually you can shove all you want Saints that's not the approach to God amen amen for he that has entered into his rest hath also ceased from his own Works remember the rest is the Holy Spirit the rest is the comforter how many wants rest how many wants the comforter how many wants the spirit of Truth let us labor therefore to enter into that rest let us do what the scripture says let's cease from our own works you say well that's easy to say but how do we do that the very next verse Hebrews 9:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing if you want to cease from your own Works you've got to allow the word of God to come into your life and Pierce you see us in hybrid flesh we're so bad off we don't even know how bad off we are and if the word of God does not show up and Pierce even to the dividing aend of Soul and Spirit and of the joints in the marrow and a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the hearts if it doesn't show up and we don't allow it to pierce us and reveal to us our real intentions our real motives our real objectives what we're really pushing for what we're really pulling for if we don't allow that to happen we're not going to cease from our own works and if we don't cease from our own Works don't expect to have rest the answer is in the Scripture A lot of times it's just the verse before or the verse after that we don't really want to read having the word of God Pierce you asunder and split your very Soul and Spirit is not a pleasant experience but it is a requirement am it is a requirement for rest for peace for God to do something in our lives perfect strength by Perfect weakness brother random says if you notice in the Bible it's always those who are trying to get away from it that God uses as long as a man wants to do something and thinks he's got enough ability he can put the job over God can never use that man look at Moses running look at Paul running and the rest of them trying to get away from it I said don't seek nothing God has got anything for you he'll give it to you amen instead of trying to be great we ought to be trying to find out how little we can get but when we are thinking that we are able to do it then God can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves one of the important things that we must Master now remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing that you've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability what a thought yeah that's right how many wants God to manifest himself in your life to its fullness he just gave us the key let us Master let us Master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside that so so that God can use us and to make a complete surrender amen we cannot use one ability this is such a simple principle but this is the principle that allowed the seals to be loosed if this is the principle that allowed the seals to be preached why do we think there's going to be another principle that's going to allow the seals to be manifest in our life if this this is the requirement for them to be sounded is this not going to be the same principle for them to be lived we cannot use one ability you know the interesting thing about this statement is that might mean that you have the ability like it's no challenge if you don't have an ability I've gave you the mechanic example before I have zero ability as a mechanic something goes wrong with the car I'm not going to try to figure it out I know there's no hope it's going down to the mechanic but what if it's a situation that I do have a natural ability about now look you can go fanatical with this I know we don't need to be fanatical but we do need to be spiritual what if it is a situation that you have an ability to do something about it the prophet is telling us you better master and discern when it's you using an ability or when it's God using your ability amen just because you have an ability doesn't mean you can use that ability amen you've got to let that discern in your own lives you know what abilities you think you have just as well as I know what abilities I think I have so I can't speak for you but I can speak for myself God by his grace put a gift to minister the gospel into my life why do I have to be in turmoil for hours before I come behind the pull pit it's an ability there is an ability to pick up the Bible and preach the word yes I didn't put it there God put it there it's not like I can even take credit for that but even within that ability I cannot do that I can't do that even if I have a good thought that I want to preach I can't do that because it would fail it has to be an ability a true ability surrender to God Amen so that God can pick up the ability and then preach the word amen you say that's a Razor's Edge it is true and that's what brother brandom said we would come to we would come to a Razor's Edge this is the conundrum like I said I can just speak for a minister cuz that's the position I'm in you put it on whatever foot that the shoe fits we have an entire Bible and 12200 tapes but what if I would come and preach something other than what he once preached for that point in time right that's terrifying yeah I'm not terrified to preach I love to preach you all know that when it's 10:00 on Wednesday night I love to preach what terrifies me is if I'm preaching what terrifies me is if I would come here this morning and I would have something to say what terrifies me is if I would come here and I would think what needs to be done exactly it's terrifying it will put you in places you don't want to be in it will have you looking for really tall Bridges it's terrifying but when he comes and he picks up an ability it just works it's joyful it's peaceful we can stay here all day praise God and according to Franco I have batteries to support it but this mechanical approach has to be in place for the Dynamics to work right and I wish I could tell you that I've got it right every time but I haven't there have been times I've stood behind the pull pit and I had a thought and I presented a thought and it was the word of God and it didn't work why because I failed to master that's right human ability that's right was there an ability yes could I do it yes did it work no why cuz the prophet said it wouldn't but when we will approach God the right way God can even do something that you don't have an ability to do that's right God yes sir I hope this is speaking to somebody this morning because I know I'm saying the same thing over and over and over Souls that are in prison now brother brand says a man that's got the spirit of God in him or a woman lives the word that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of God comes to them and they are the word to the people what a statement that's the heartbeat that predestin at for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people written Epistles read of all men is that right could the third poll be on is the third poll to preach to the Eternal doomed that's rejected the message of Salvation And this is where he makes this statement the six seal has produced itself uh speaking of the judgments coming on the earth The Sixth Seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to Earth I find it extremely interesting that he makes that statement immediately after he says that the word of God comes to this group of people and they are the word to the people what is the seventh seal the seven seal is not a piece of paper wrote up with a stamp on it the seventh seal is when Christ comes back to Earth that's why brother brandom said I can take one of these seals and I can go from Genesis to Revelation and I can preach it around and around and around the clock because the seventh seal is not a definition of the interpretation of these symbols the seventh seal is an event and the seventh seal was all the way way back in Genesis it wasn't just in Revelation it's just not now it's now that we understand it's now that we can see that it was all the way back but it was still going on back then because why because the seventh seal is when Christ comes back to Earth let me say it this way the seventh seal is when Christ shows up in your situation amen the seventh seal is not when you show up in your situation the seventh seal is Christ coming into your situation amen he says the six seal has produced itself obviously six comes right before seven what's the Sixth Seal judgment what brings the seventh seal judgment we've got to judge ourselves understand that we're not worthy understand that we don't stand a chance understand that we can't fix this problem amen mechanically approach the seventh seal the mechanics have to be in place the mechanics are judging ourselves coming to the appropriate conclusion that I have no human ability to fix this or to Manifest this or to make this word of God live and then and only then the seventh seal can come back to earth the lamb came and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down claimed what he owned what he had redeemed is that right it's always been that third poll three is perfection the ministry comes to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural among human beings what is the Perfection what is the purpose what is the third poll I mean we can spend days and hours and services on that the third poll brother brandom says comes to its Perfection when Christ comes back in Earth in your Earth that's the point but that is only going to happen when we judge ourselves properly Revelation 81 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour now we're going to go through just a few examples and then we're going to close Daniel 3:16 Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said unto the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and we will deliver and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not you know what that means that's right is they're having faith and they are believing but they don't really know but if not be it known unto you oh King that we shall not serve thy God nor worship the golden image which thou has set up that means here's my problem and God is able to deliver me and I believe God will deliver me I believe God is going to provide an answer for the situation that I am in now but if he doesn't I'm still not going to do what you're telling me to do I am still not going to prostrate myself before a false god I am still not going to subject myself to my own ideas I am even if he doesn't come on the scene I am still going not going to figure this out myself I find it amazing that brother brandham would say the bride of Christ will have thus saith the Lord or keep still see there's two things there it's just not always having thus sayith the Lord right it's having thus sayith the Lord or not having thus sayith the Lord and keeping your mouth shut that's righten there are two options we don't always have to be the spiritual person in the room with all the answers and all that thus sayith the Lord right there is a second option there amen I don't know but if he has anything for me he will reveal it to [Music] me be it known unto thee that we will not serve thy God nor worship the golden image which which thou Hast set up then was Nebuchadnezzar are full of Fury I'm going to paraphrase some of this just for time sake and he wrapped them up with rope threw them into fire the people that threw him in fire obviously didn't have the right mechanical approach to God and they died and he answers and said Lo did not we cast three men into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true oh King factual that is right undisputable we put three men in the fire he answered and said I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and in the and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning firey furnace and spake and said ye Servants of the most high God come forth and come hither and they came forth and came hither then nabuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who hath sent his Angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God the Fourth Man In The Fire we love the story it's encouraging we love it we want to talk about it all the time what's the prerequisite to the Fourth Man In The Fire silence yeah silence Our God can but I don't know if he will that's right even if he doesn't I'm not going to violate his word there is a mechanical approach here what's the mechanical approach is we are obeying the word of God this is the word of God it says Thou shalt not do this we are not going to do this even if we don't know the ultimate outcome yeah amen amen we don't know what God's going to do here we believe that he will we know that he can but we don't know but in the meantime we're going to start building some matters we're going to go get some real heavy clothing to put on anybody got a really big bucket of water no it was simple here's the problem here's the word that says what we can do and what we can't do it doesn't say what God's going to do so I'm going to speak where he speaks and I'm going to be silent where he's silent and I'm going to approach him with the right mechanics and then I'm going to allow him to to do what only he can do because I can't deliver myself from this fiery furnace I want to go back to verse 19 and read because I think there's something extremely interesting in this verse then Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and his form of his Vis Vis was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the SE the furnace one seven times more than it was want to be heated I wonder if that's a clue I wonder if that's a clue to them wonder if it's a clue to us God is about to come back to earth again God is about to appear in flesh again God is about to come on the scene and fix the problem the seventh seal is about to be manifested he didn't heat it four times more it was heated up seven times why because there was silence immediately preceding that Exodus 78 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying when Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying show a miracle for you then shalt thou say unto Aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent and Moses went and Aaron went unto pharaoh and they did as the Lord had commanded mechanics mechanics they did as the Lord commanded and Aaron cast his rod down before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent then Pharaoh also called called the wise men and the sorcerers now the M magicians of Egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents well bummer that sure didn't go the way we thought it was going to let's let's go get some more sticks and throw them down and maybe if we get more sticks we'll have more serpents no brother brandham said Moses stood there and he did not know what to do that's ex God did not show him the whole picture God just said you go do this and if everything goes sideways and everything doesn't turn out the way you think just just be quiet no doubt Moses being a man was like uhoh yep that's all I got that's all I got no doubt he was fervently praying Lord this don't look good that's right I'll tell you one thing Moses didn't do is he didn't try to fix the problem the reason the scripture continues and says but Aaron's Rod swallowed up their rods is because Moses and Aaron didn't try to fix the problem and then the scriptures right before that it says they did what God commanded them to do they had the right mechanical approach to allow God to dynamically come on the scene Genesis 7:5 and Noah did according to all the Lord commanded him if you're spiritual you're going to grasp a theme here he did according to all that the Lord commanded him and Noah was 600 years old when the flood of waters was upon the Earth Noah went in his sons his wife his wife's Sons with him his son's wife's with him into the ark because of the Waters of the flood of the clean beasts and of the beasts that are not clean and of fouls and of everything that creepeth upon the Earth there went in two and two unto Noah unto the arc the Mel and the female as God hath commanded Noah and it came to pass after seven days the Noah said Lord It's kind of stinking in here I preached for 120 years remember um okay you don't know it's not raining Lord here's my question that ask you before what did Noah do to make it rain how did Noah make God fulfill his word how did Noah bring the fullness of the promised word for his day into effect for every everybody to see the answer is always the answer he didn't there was not a single thing Moses could do to make it rain he's in the boat God has shut the door and there is nothing he can do nothing and that is the only position that he can be in for God to then do the Dynamics for then God to open The Fountains of the deep verse 10 and they did so as the Lord had commanded them I'm sorry verse 5 and Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him Noah put the mechanics in place and didn't touch the Dynamics no doubt being a man he may have got frustrated as brother brandom dramatizes it his family was kind of giving him a little bit of grief can I give you some advice from somebody who's about to be 40 who really don't know anything so take it for what you want when Daddy don't know the answer don't make Daddy come up with an answer when your husband don't know the answer be glad that he's honest enough to tell you you don't know the answer don't make Daddy or husband come up with an answer just get in the boat let God shut the door do all of the me the mechanics do all that God's told you to do and then let God provide the answer because if Daddy comes with the answer or the husband comes up with the answer here's a better one for you don't expect the pastor to have all the answers that was fresh just for you don't expect anybody don't force anybody into having the answer approach god with the right mechanics allow God to supernaturally move on the scene is the daddy the one that's supposed to get the answer sure is the husband the one sure is the pastor the one sure is the prophet the one that was supposed to have the sure but allow it to be God through that vessel because if it's just that vessel Daddy's answer is going to not it's going to fail husband's answer it's going to fail pastor's answer it's going to fail might work several times in a row but it'll eventually fail the prophet's answer it's going to fail that's why he would tell that lady that she was wanting him just say thus sayith the Lord just say it brother BR just say this is a lady with faith you just say it I'll believe it it'll happen he says I can't that's right yeah amen I want to but I can't but when he tells me to say it I'll say it big difference such a simple principle we violate it every day you can put whatever vessel that you want to in there husband father Pastor Prophet mother school teacher mechanic don't force your mechanic to have the answer it won't work a true mechanic is Anointed to be a mechanic if there's any body that's anoint that's got to be anointed it's somebody that works on cars Ruth 3 verse 5 and she said unto her Ruth speaking to Naomi all that thou sayest unto me I will do we catching the theme amen and she went down under the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law B her meaning she put the mechanics in place and when Boaz had entered he when he had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid down and it came to pass at midnight that the man the man was afraid and he turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she said she answered I am Ruth thy handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter what did Ruth do what strings did she pull to get this response out of Boaz Boaz could have easily stood up and said I don't know what you're doing here but you are obviously in a compromising position you are threatening my reputation we're taking you before the elders why did she get the response that she was looking for prise God what did she do to make that happen the answer once again is nothing amen she had no ability no ability to make Boaz respond favorably to her how did she get this Dynamic response that changed her entire life because she did mechanically what she was told to do she did mechanically what the word of God said to do you know when Ruth got there and laid herself down I'm pretty sure she was silent I don't think she had a lot to say at that time I think she realized she was hanging between life and death and she probably better just be quiet and pray that God moves on the scene and pray that she's done everything mechanically right and if she hasn't that God will reveal it she she can fix it real quick fast like in a hurry because things are really coming to a climax but the one thing she didn't do she didn't open her mouth until Boaz spoke to her and Boaz said now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city and my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman there is nothing Ruth could have done to pull that down to make that happen to make the Redeemer come on the scene follow me please there is nothing she could have done to make the Redeemer come on the seene for the seventh seal to be this is the seventh seal Saints this is Christ coming to Earth again for for Ruth's sake why was it manifested because of the proper approach that's right amen and the servant Genesis 2 249 and the servant put his hand on of the thigh of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning the matter I'm going to interpret that for you Abraham said you go and do this elaser put his hand under his thigh and swore I'm going to do what you told me to do that's right ex the proper approach I'm going to skip through some of this because I think we're getting the point and for time's sake but I want to ask you how did elaser make Becca come out and say hey have a drink and while you're drinking I'll Water your camels how did he make that happen he didn't amen but he mechanically lined up everything that would be a hindrance to that and got it out of the way he said to his master I'm going to do what you told me to do and nothing else and when he got there he he prayed and said Lord if El easier thought for a second that he could make this happen why is he asking the Lord and why is he asking the Lord so specifically like if he has enough faith in his own discernment to pick the right one and to fix the problem and get the solution why is he praying it's not only got to be this way but it's got to be this way and she's got to say this and she's got to water the camels you talk about fleece the Lord this is not a person who has faith in his own abilities to get it right First Kings 18:30 you don't have to turn there we're going to paraphrase this one as well and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down I'm going to interpret this to you again he got in his prayer closet and he prayed for God to reveal to him any of the word that was not in line in his life and then he first got himself in line with the word he repaired the altar he sought God and he repaired the altar that was broken down that's the a updated version to you that's the me and you version we don't need to go stack stones on top of each other we don't need to build an physical altar the altar is how we approach God the altar is our approach to God and we better make sure that we've got that right before we start screaming for the fire to fall because if that's not right we're not going to be in any better position than the other false prophets the people came near and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down I'm going to skip down 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel not let it be known that I am a a true Prophet that's right and that I'm telling the truth and that I've got things right and I'm clearly more spiritual than these his prayer was Lord let you be manifested let you be revealed here today that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that thou H have done all these things at Thy word then the fire of the the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench again my question is how did Elijah make that happen you know the answer let's come to a close with this let's turn to this one because this one is super crucial Job 1 Job 1 and I pray that as we read this God will let you put yourself in this don't leave this thousands of years ago remember we're talking about the ability to have faith after a revelation we're talking about the ability to approach God the right way we're talking about the ability for the seventh seal Christ in Earth to be manifested we're talking about the ability for the fullness of the word to come on the scene this is the principle there was a man in the land whose name was job and the man was perfect and upright and one that feared God God and a Shu evil we're off to a really good start here I want that to be said about me we are off to a really good start verse 5 and it was so when the days of their feasting meaning of his children were gone about that job sent and Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts thus did job continually we are continually on a hot streak he is perfect and upright he is giving the appropriate sacrifices he is even taking dominion and possession of his children and offering sacrifices for them between verse 5 and verse 20 there's a lot of things that go bad go sideways that job didn't plan for job didn't sign up for job didn't want I'm not going to take the time to read those but you all know the story we get to verse 20 after all of these bad things have happened all of these bad things horrendous things terrible things then job arose and rent his manle mantle and shaved his head and fell down up the upon the ground and worshiped that is not a 2024 reaction not only did he worship but he said and I am naked when I came out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return the Lord give and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord in all of this job sinned not nor charged God foolishly Lord I say be it unto me according to your word chapter 5 verse one we know there is a lot of things that happen but we're just going to skip some of that for time sake we come to chapter 5 verse one now moreover the Lord answered job and said how did job get the Lord to talk to him how did job get the Lord to talk to him what did he do to pull that down what did he do to make that happen this is the answer to his his question remember this is what he wanted all along was if if I knew where God lived if I knew where his house was I'd just go there and I talk to like this this is what he wanted and it's finally happening how did he make this happen moreover the Lord answered job and said shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth God let him answer it then job answered the Lord and said behold I am vile what shall I answer Thee I will lay my hand upon my mouth also interpreted I will be silent once have I spoken but I will not answer yay twice I spoke but I will proceed no further job started out in this book perfect upright righteous before God giving the appropriate sacrifices sacrificing for his children somewhere between there these troubles came in and somehow in the midst of All the Troubles job backslid a little bit because even job being righteous being the bride I might say even job being in the message I might say even job sitting under the five-fold ministry positionally placed even job doing everything right when trouble set in job still had in his hybrid flesh the same thing that me and you have every day that we fight against when all we've done all of this right mechanically we've lined it up we've got it all right and I don't belittle that that's important we need to know who we are we need to be positionally placed we need to be doing things right but in all of that when things went sideways suddenly something comes out of job that we haven't seen before job thinks he's got something to say job thinks he's got something to say not only once but he says twice twice I opened my mouth I had something to say but job now comes to the Revelation that is not the appropriate approach to God you know what revealed this to job God coming on the scene it's a funny thing when God comes on the scene you realize you need to be quiet brother Ram says everybody tells me when the angel shows up will you will you ask him this will you he said listen right you don't understand I'm so terrified I'm not about to say anything about anything job starts out out righteous job starts out pure and he was I'm not belittling that I'm not disputing that job is on the right track but when things go sideways really sideways like it took a lot to draw this out but it finally it finally comes to the surface things finally get so rough and so tough and so hard and so confusing that job just can't hold his peace anymore he's got to say something you know what Joe basically says is this isn't fair exactly in a nutshell that's basically what he says job lies right in the message the bride under the right word for his age things get so hard tough Pinchy squeezy I might say that Satan finally gets job to lie and say I don't deserve this God should come and fix this immediately this isn't fair you know what happens six seal comes on the scene and God renders judgment who are you that's right to be reproving [Music] me you know what happened next the fifth seal grace extended to job and he realized I have opened my mouth when I should not have opened my mouth and I will therefore now shut my mouth forever that's good you know what happened next prise God the seventh seal amen Christ comes to job's situation personally verse six then answered the Lord out of then answered the Lord unto job out of the Whirlwind I'm not going to read the rest of it that's the point this is what job needed all along it's what he wanted all along but somehow he deviated away from the right the right approach it didn't work for job why do we think it's going to work for us as the musicians would come sat at their instruments for another half an hour while I keep preaching hey we're about being honest today right no I promise I'll try not to do that let's go to Revelation 5 Revelation 5 very very familiar beginning in verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much John wept much the bride wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to open and to read the book neither to look there on and and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof how did John make that happen how did John find this man who was worthy the answer is he didn't but he approached m meally the right way because when it says in verse 4 and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book and to look there there on that is John saying it is what it is right I'm not worthy either right I can't fix this that's right I acknowledge the fact everything is lost unless somebody else comes on the scene I acknowledge the fact that as the bride under the message of the hour under the proper angel I am still not worthy and I still have no ability to fulfill the Plan of Redemption it's because of that that verse five can come into existence and one of the elders sath unto me weep not he never said oh you're wrong you really do stand a slight chance like it's a 1% chance but no he never tried to correct John and make him feel better as far as you're worthy there's another option he simply says weep not weep not behold he's going going to come to Earth again he's going to manifest himself again the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book to loose since it's not a book papers it's me and you amen it's me and you we cannot reveal this mystery ourselves he has got to come the lon of the tribe of Judah step into this yes forsake all of our abilities amen and loose the seals in our life amen don't weep acknowledge the facts we don't stand a chance without him that's true that's accurate acknowledge that approach him humbly but he's going to be the one to have to do this work there is nothing we can do even with a revelation of who we are and our position and all the mechanics lined up there is still nothing we could have done or can do to fulfill and bring a close to this Plan of Redemption whoever is in here that has the ability to change your atoms come on come on right we've better come to terms with we have no ability to change our atams am because things are going to get tighter things are going to get rougher things are going to get squeezi and our desire to change our atoms is going to be more prevalent and more prevalent and more pre prevalent you said I don't think things are so bad like I just went on vacation last week we had just wait just wait this is just me you take it for what it's worth God gave us this message to let us know the truth so that we could be restored but he gave us this message so that we could finish The Plan of Redemption in order to finish the Plan of Redemption we have to write what was first wrong and the first wrong was a bride who couldn't wait and took her own idea amen right her desire was not wrong your desire for your atoms to change is not wrong but you better not get impatient and try to make it happen yourself right because you're going to find yourself violating the scripture and the pattern of God when this squeeze comes that is not the time to lose our cool to come up with a better idea to have a plan B right that is the time to say this is not fun I don't like this but it's not unfair I deser I deserve everything I got coming that is the time to rest what else are we going to do Saints listen we do not have this squeeze figured out I promise you I don't know how it's going to happen but here's one promise I will make you there are going to be events happen that you did not foresee happening I promise you before this is done and over we are going to be left on the ash Heap scratching our heads not having a clue how to fix things because that is the test we have to win that is the test that Eve failed it's the test we have to win in order to write what was wrong and I don't know what form that's going to manifest itself in and I don't know what agencies will be behind that and I don't know what people will be behind that right but that is what God is training us in our personal lives now for when these problems come up in our personal lives that we don't have the answer for it's not just about that situation it's about the end of redemption he's in his grace training Us in carnal things now and in natural things now and in some spiritual things now so that we won't mess up when we get to the real test yeah this is not just about oh you know I passed the test and I received my healing because I didn't try to get into the way that's fine but you're going to get sick again you're going to have something else happened that you need healed that's not the ultimate as brother R says we don't major on a minor that's the minor though we don't want to belittle that we don't want to uh trivialize that but that's not the point the point is to learn the principle that I'm not going to take my own way amen and when I don't like what one doctor says I'm going to go to another hoping he gives me a better report or I'm going to try this this remedy instead no no no let's say Lord I don't have the answer to this I don't care whether it's a toothache or whether it's cancer that's not the point we overcome in the same way we overcome by saying I don't have the answer to this how do you want to fix this praise God and he may anoint you to do something yourself or he may anoint you to go to somebody else or to go to a doctor or to get Deliverance for something or to take your car to the mechanic he may anoint you and reveal to you to do whatever he wants to do that's fine but let's have our own agenda that I want it fixed this way I want to do it this way and not only that but I want it done yesterday this principle is what the finishing of redemption hinges on the reason that John could be told don't weep the line of the tribe of Judah has come on the scene is because of Revelation 81 there was silence in heaven you know what that silence was I don't know what all of it was but I know what some of it was and that was John keeping his mouth shut that was John acknowledging the fact I am who I am he's called me to be who he's called me to be but I don't have the answer to this John was a part of this silence I hope you're connecting the pieces Saints we can get W so wound up about ourselves having the truth and being the Brine and being in the message and knowing this and knowing that no let's be careful that we don't know everything let's be careful that we don't become the line of the tribe of Judah that's right right thank god let's be careful amen couple more statements and then we're going to close now I want to make this statement because I don't want to be accused of being a soft preacher and telling you that there's nothing you can do and you don't have to do anything listen all these examples and all of these stories are not excuses to be lazy this is not I can't do anything anyhow God's got to do it I'm going to sit here and wait for him to do it sir no listen if you want something out of church come early get in the right atmosphere sing the songs of Zion and then expect something out of the service expect God to come back in Earth again and speak to you don't do this expect God to come and speak to you out of an earth and vessel when you've bypassed all the mechanics that we've been taught yeah you didn't come early you didn't pray you didn't pull you couldn't open your mouth to sing the songs of Zion because you were in a bad mood you couldn't Raise Your Hands In Worship you see what I'm saying amen that's right amen but yet there's nothing I can what can you do to make that Minister speak directly to you right not a thing not a thing but violate the mechanics and I guarantee you he won't speak to you the only chance we have is to do all that we know to do and then wait that's right amen that's the principle I have no idea why it's taken me an hour and 46 minutes to say it it works in the micro it works in the macro and I may have those backwards but it works works in the little picture it works in the big picture it works in church it works at work it works at Family it works if we will approach him correctly questions and answers he says now don't interpret anything if God wants you to know anything he'll send it to you so you just be a real real solid now hold still something has happened you understand what I mean don't you don't try to make yourself odd to be a Christian if you'll allow me I'll interject my understanding of that don't try to make yourself overly spiritual to be a Christian right don't try to make yourself spiritual looking to be a Christian odd he says don't try to do that because you take yourself away from God well well that make sense when I try to be more spiritual than I am I'm probably moving away from God Amen because I'm taking a substitute that's right yeah right if you can understand it this is that third poll I thought the third pole was the opening of the word and the spoken word being on the tongue of man again and all that Adam lost was don't try to make yourself odd to be a Christian because you take yourself away from God if you understand it this is that third pole what is he saying Saints the principle of the third poll the principle of the third poll is first a man getting himself out of the way not making something of himself admitting I don't have the answer to this I don't have the complete opening of the word in myself only the lamb can do that it's the same principle that allowed the preaching that will allow the manifestation in our lives by not trying to be something we're not by not trying to act like we got things figured out when we don't by not trying to be the spiritual person in the room I will assure you the quickest way to get away from the truth is to be the most spiritual person in the room he is the most spiritual person in the room if you'll just play something softly Jezebel religion brother brandom is recounting the vision of when he went beyond the curon of time he says but in that Vision here not long ago and here was those people standing around like that when they said and I said will Paul have to be judged for the gospel he preached they said yes I said I've preached every word just exactly the way he did and the millions screamed out we're resting on that I think I may have said this here before forgive me if I have but I'll just feel to say it again the sixth the di menion everybody in the sixth Dimension doesn't have a problem with what the prophet said nobody over there has a problem with what he said and the things that he got wrong and the visions that didn't happen God and the facts that don't line up nobody in the sixth dimension has that problem how do we think that we're going to have those problems here and go to that Dimension remember brother R says you don't change when you shift Dimensions what you are here you are there so if I'm want how many wants to go to the sixth Dimension maybe we should have the appropriate approach what God has said he is what God has thought he is revealed through that vessel and that vessel has spoken it and if I will get myself out of the way God can then he doesn't have to there is nothing that says God has to reveal this to me but if I can get myself out of the way and die completely to my own ideas and my own desires and my own timeline I now open myself to the possibility that he'll move on the scene for me and he will reveal himself to me I can assure that he won't do that if I violate his mechanics and I take my own thoughts my own ways my own ideas and my own timeline that's a big one the timeline's a big one so a lot of times easy to lay down your own ideas and your own ways and your own agenda but Leota is so possessed of here and now that's what we fight against saints what's the hardest thing to do take time to read your Bible and pray is it not is that not the hardest thing that you fight is taking the time why is time such a hindrance in the new heavens and the new Earth you're not go we're not going to have the opportunity to make time for Christ there is no time you can't make time for him there this Dimension is the only opportunity that we have to make time for Christ that's why it's the hardest thing to do because time is running out time is being pressed we have to fight against that the millions screamed out we are resting on that I just want to make that simple statement Dimensions should not change our confession I want to confess in this Dimension I'm resting on that I don't have it all figured out but I know where the answers are at and I'm resting on that and I'm just going to stand back and be real real solid yes yeah and admit that I don't know everything but if he has something for me he'll reveal it to me because I think I'm in a lot better position than that last quote and I'm closing closing as we would stand I just want to crystallize this in our minds of where we're at spoken word is the Original Seed brother brandom says that's what's the matter with the Pentecostals today now I understand Pentecostals was an or organization but we understand Pentecostal is a spirit let's view this in light of that because shocking I know but there's Pentecostal ideas in the message Pentecostalism is a spirit but brother Brandon's going to reveal to us one of the characteristics of that that's what's the matter with Pentecostals today they're manufacturing something right they can't wait they just can't wait so they commit adultery tears now we starts defining them tears not wheat this is not a wheat characteristic that'll manufacture something this is a tear characteristic and in case you don't know your Bible the tears don't end up in a good place you don't want to be a tear you don't want to have this characteristic tears to manufacture something and what does it bring forth like it did the first time the first bride that couldn't wait you don't have to raise your hand but how many believes we've been called into a bright age that we have been called into a free age that we have been called into an abrahamic AG let's not believe that mentally and having our character and our life manufacturing things like Pentecost would still do if we say that we're in a bright age you know what that means it means I've moved into an age that I realize I can do nothing and he has to come on the scene to do it the difference between the Pentecostal age and the bride age is only the lamb can come and take the book in the Pentecostal age the preacher could come and take take the book and he can manufacture something and you know what's amazing about it is it'll get results some results but it won't accomplish the end goal it will eventually run out and they find themselves manufacturing something that Spirit tries to bleed over into the message that manufacturing something that is not the bride age amen that is not the bride the first bride he says couldn't wait what do we think the second bride's going to do in order to write the wrong we've got to wait what does wait mean wait means it's referring to a time element that's the hardest thing Saints that's the hardest thing is the time element right because we so desperately one out of here right and we so desperately want the answers to the questions we're facing right now that's right but what if it's not God's time give you the answer to that question right now there can come the test what are you going to do I think we have to come to terms with the fact that we can no more fix our carnal problems and our spiritual problems then we can make our atoms change that's going to be the final test and that's why brother Rand says she'll have thus sayith the Lord or she'll keep still I'm going to close there Psalms 46:10 such a small scripture such a profound effect how many wants to know that he is God you've been there before I'm sure he's come on the scene and taken your breath away he's fixed things you know you couldn't fix he's done what you know you could not do how many wants more of that in their life how many wants to know he is God not only is he God he's still a living God I believe that's our heart's desire if you want to know that he's God in your situation here and now today the answer is to be quiet to be still allow there to be silence in heaven amen it's hard to do it's easy to say it's hard to do but you can see how that relates back to the change of the ministry how that allowed the third pole to come into existence how that allowed the spoken word to be placed on somebody's tongue in the natural to create things and then in the spiritual to speak the spoken word over me and you to loose the seals so that we could come a new creation it all hinges on that principle and that principle was established out in the middle of the Woods by a man squirrel hunting who just had the humility to say to God and acknowledge to God I can't preach on that I don't know I don't even know anything about it it's because he humbled himself and he came to that point that anything else could happen let's bow our heads together precious Lord Jesus father we just thank you for truth Lord a simple thought a simple principle I've been lengthy with it Lord but you see how it's a birth on My Heart Lord father and I I don't preach this out of criticalness Lord or blaming anybody else father I can preach this because you have been so gracious in my life to move on the scene and open my eyes to do something that I knew I could not do and Lord to give me a proper standard in my life to compare things to and now Lord that the proper standard has been given by your grace I can look back and see how many times I tried to do something and how it failed and how it was wrong and didn't work Lord father and it's our it's my prayer and I know it's these people's prayer moving forward father may we not inject ourself into this your Prophet said we standing on the threshold of the Millennium time is coming to an end father you have been giving us test after test after test in the natural and in some spiritual matters so that we would learn not to take our own ways and that we would learn not to inject ourselves into something and that we would learn to Humble ourselves and not make oursel odd and not make oursel spiritual so that you could come on the scene Lord we thank you that you didn't just immediately throw us into the final test Lord for surely we would have failed but Lord you have mechanically in your grace taught us and brought us through these things so that we would be on a firm foundation and we would know how to overcome in this hour that is coming I've prayed Lord that we would stay humble before you that we would stay sensitive before you and that we would be bold when you reveal yourself to us and how you want to do something but may we be ever so Meek beforehand Lord we just commit ourselves to you with the prayer that you would Manifest this principle in our life in every aspect as we yield our our elv to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray the bride says amen God bless you sis brother Blake teach me Lord Brother CH to way down on my knees till in your own good time you answer my plee teach me not to rely on what others do but to wait in prayer for an answer from you they that wait upon the Lord shall re to their strength they shall Mount up with we as and he they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not Fain teach me Lord teach me [Music] to amen what good instruction we got today oh I feel so corrected so encouraged so taught by the Lord today and I just say God I want that to be the practice of my life because I know what was taught was true I know it was God's way and God's approach and I know it's right and I see where I failed it many times and I'm sorry but I want that to be my Approach you feel the same way oh I just don't want to say much I just want to absorb I myself want to learn the lesson I want to I want to be that way about everything in life so I can wait on God and let God do what only God can do I don't want to inject myself amen we thank God for his word we appreciate what he's done for us now my desires is to go and manifest what I've heard amen sing that song they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength let's sing that together will teach me Lord to wait while hearts are a flame help me humble my proud and call on your name keep my Fai R keep my eyes on help me beond this Earth what you you want me to be they wait upon the Lord shall [Music] R string they shall Mount up with wings as and he go they shall run and not be wey they shall walk and not F teach me Lord teach me Lord to teach me Lord and teach be to way down on might tell in your good time you answer my please teach me not to rely on what others do but to W him pray for an answer from you and teach me Lord toit while hearts are a flame help me humble my pride and call on your name keep my faith renewed keep my eyes on thee help me beond this Earth what you want me to be for they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall m up with wings as and E they shall run and not be wey they shall walk and not Fain teach me Lord teach me Lord to [Music] amen can we pull up that last verse again and put it back on the overhead amen the last one the next yeah how many want to mount up as Eagles Mount up with wings as are we called is this an eagle age are we called to fly then we're going to have to wait for him to renew our strength amen I I think it's so amazing when when we realize it's not we who's flying it's him who's flying in us and if we can wait we shall run and not be weary we shall walk and not faint you know why because it won't be us doing it'll be him in us doing it how many have gotten really tired trying to move obstacles out of your life and solve problems got really weary and worn out and tired and exhausted and discouraged and felt like quitting amen that's what happens when we try to do things when we try to fix things when we try to solve problems but how many have been there when God comes on the scene and supernaturally answers the question and it's like flying friends it's like it just comes and it just happens and everything falls into place and it's as simple as setting your wings and flying and then you run and are not weary and then you walk and you don't faint why because it's not you doing it it's not me doing it it's God doing it through us I think we're learning that's the only thing that's going to work is when he does it where is he going to do it through you are you going to do it yes are you going to do it no it's going to be him through me it's not going to be separate and independent of me but it's not going to be me independent of him amen I'm completely dependent on him man I thank God and I just like to sing that verse again amen and then we're just going to continue to to worship but make it more than a song let's let's make this a living reality in our lives by being patient the thing we need most is patience when patience has finished her perfect work it'll make us perfect and tire wanting nothing what is that complete finished final product what's going to bring me to the final product perfect that means fully mature complete entire that means completely whatever he wants me to be perfect and tire wanting nothing what will get me there patience patience will have her perfect work and bringing me to the place he wants me to be oh it's so good let's sing this together they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings and he they shall run and not be wey they shall walk not F teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait one more time and they that wait upon the Lord shall [Music] renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as and E go they shall run and not be weary they shall walk in enough pain teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait well it's not in trying but in trusting it's not in running but in [Music] resting it's not in wondering but in [Applause] pray that we find the strength of the Lord not in [Music] trying it's not in run but in resting it's not in one but in pray that we find the strength of the lord well it's not in trying but in trusting it's enough not in running but in
