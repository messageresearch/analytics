========================================

you get to the end of life you don't have the physical strength you had you don't have the mental strength that you used to have you can't cover everything in life by your youthfulness weakness starts to creep in and it will for all of us and as weakness Creeps in we begin to realize I can't do what I used to do I can't care for myself I can't make it happen I don't have what I used to have I don't think like I used to do I don't act like I used to do what is it I need more than anything I need him more than anything I need he that's greater in me than he that's in this world because this guy is letting me down what I used to depend on to earn money Amen to fix things that were broke to overcome challenges in my life I used to depend on this flesh yes I used to when I was in my 20s when I was in my 30s I could work around the clock there was days that I put in 40 some hours at work and I never slept and I was still fine and my my Montage was always work harder if you got a problem work harder you need more money work more hours if you got overcome something you just work that's all you got to do is work amen what happens when you can't work anymore you realize for many of us in our youthful years we were relying on the outer man we were relying on our own intellect and our own strength and our outer man and we could always overcome obstacles because we were still young and still vibrant and we could still think and we could still process we could still do that's why the most glorious time in a child of God's life is when those leaves are changing colors cuz maybe they've learned a few things along the way I can't walk like I used to I can't overcome I can't I can't build a house anymore can't re-roof my house I can't fix my car like I used to I amen so what are we left with I need God I need the spirit of God to lead me every day of my life oh God help me to get there now I said go God help you if you're 15 16 17 19 20 21 God help you get there now because God never intended for man to sh shift for himself he wanted to be completely relling upon God where is your overcoming power in you amen where is he that overcometh in you how will he overcome by might in the Inner Man where is everything that I have need of coming from that which is inside of me you know what I need to do more than anything more than get up early and work more hours what I need to do is get up early and talk to him longer spend more time aligning my thinging with his ling read his word pray meditate just think on him listen to good things listen to sermons listen to music do something to De feed the Inside Man so that I could drink and drink and drink and then I'm not God there's nothing for me to put on on the outside there's nothing for me to correct or make happen what needs to happen will come from the strength from the inner man amen greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world that's nothing but the truth friends and the evil one is that body you live in and the world is influencing that body in your mind all the time the lust of the eyes the the lust of the flesh the pride of life so where am I going to overcome it not through more mind not through more intellect not through more willpower there's the problem where am I going to overcome it with the Inside Man
