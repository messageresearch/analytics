[0:53] lord we
[0:56] bless your
[0:59] name
[1:04] praise the lord amen
[1:07] this is different amen but i like it
[1:11] in the men's thing is nice it's not as
[1:14] beautiful as when the sisters are here
[1:15] but
[1:16] hey we did what we could amen god bless
[1:18] you it's good to see you all here and
[1:20] we're so happy for the brothers that
[1:22] were able to gather and we know
[1:23] many are gathering at home via the
[1:26] internet through streaming and we just
[1:28] thank god for that
[1:30] i have to turn my mic on praise the lord
[1:34] i usually don't forget that unless we do
[1:36] something unusual like have a weird
[1:38] service
[1:39] in a different way let's take our bibles
[1:41] and turn to first peter chapter one
[1:45] and we'll just get started right away i
[1:47] just want to give an
[1:48] update on the saints that had been sick
[1:51] and that had been
[1:52] sick with the coven 19. uh most of you
[1:55] know sister bestie wood is back home
[1:57] she's doing really really well
[1:58] uh by the grace of god but the steve and
[2:00] sister marshall home and recovering well
[2:03] but from everybody i talk to it's just
[2:05] one of those things that they just stay
[2:07] tired
[2:08] day after day after day it lingers so
[2:11] just be praying that god will give them
[2:12] strength
[2:13] supernaturally strengthen them god is
[2:15] healing them they're doing much much
[2:16] better
[2:17] their home brothers stephen sister and
[2:19] marsha are no longer under quarantine
[2:21] so they can get out when they feel like
[2:23] getting out they just don't feel like
[2:25] getting out
[2:26] and sister bessie the same way but
[2:28] brother dave wood he's never had one
[2:30] symptom he's been feeling good but he's
[2:32] still locked down under quarantine for
[2:33] another week
[2:34] so pray for him as well but we thank god
[2:38] for his mercies amen
[2:40] well also brother tom and sister barb
[2:42] were quite sick a little over a week ago
[2:44] they've been sick
[2:46] brother tom took sister barb to the
[2:47] emergency room and she had some tests
[2:49] but
[2:50] she she was tested positive for
[2:52] influenza b
[2:53] she got some treatment she started
[2:54] feeling better but brother tommy's still
[2:56] lingering with that tiredness
[2:59] low-grade fever day after day and so
[3:01] he's been struggling with that so be
[3:02] praying for him
[3:03] that god will just turn that situation
[3:05] around he says i feel all right i'm just
[3:07] tired all the time
[3:08] so we need to pray for him and then i
[3:10] found out friday brother gene petry he
[3:12] had been sick and
[3:13] i didn't realize he had been sick for
[3:15] almost a week but they tested him and
[3:17] friday he
[3:18] tested positive for coping 19 but never
[3:20] had to go to the doctor hospital he's at
[3:22] home
[3:22] he said he's recovering he's feeling
[3:24] better he's seeing improvement
[3:26] but the same thing just feels wiped out
[3:28] and tired all the time so
[3:30] we just pray we thank god for his mercy
[3:32] amen
[3:33] thank god for his promise of healing
[3:35] that by his stripes
[3:36] we are already healed but we just ask
[3:38] the lord to just
[3:40] quicken the healing process and we know
[3:43] god
[3:43] promised us healing it's a promise
[3:46] miracles weren't promised to us miracles
[3:48] are an instant recovery
[3:50] but healing is a process and many of our
[3:52] brothers and sisters are going through
[3:53] the process but we just ask god to
[3:55] quicken that process for them
[3:57] to get them feeling strong and healthy
[3:59] and everybody else is doing good and we
[4:01] thank god for that and
[4:03] we just look forward and long for the
[4:04] day that this trial has passed
[4:07] but we know that if this trial passes
[4:09] we're just getting ready to step into
[4:10] the next one so
[4:12] you know that's just the way it is
[4:15] and here at the end time they're coming
[4:17] fast
[4:18] the birth pains are increasing in the
[4:20] earth and everything is speeding up and
[4:22] the intensity and the frequency of birth
[4:25] pains is growing and the trials
[4:27] seem to be coming faster and more
[4:28] intense all the time
[4:30] amen it must be time to fly
[4:33] god is doing a good job of pulling all
[4:35] the feathers out of the nest
[4:37] i don't know about you but this world is
[4:38] less comfortable for me now than it was
[4:40] even a couple weeks ago
[4:42] so god in his mercy he knows exactly
[4:44] what his children need and he knows how
[4:46] to make us uncomfortable
[4:48] and more uncomfortable and more
[4:50] uncomfortable until the
[4:51] greatest desire in our heart is to see
[4:54] him manifested glorified his word
[4:56] performed
[4:56] and us to move to the next phase that he
[4:59] has for us
[5:00] i believe god has to get get us to the
[5:03] place where
[5:05] this world is not our home not that we
[5:08] just say it with words
[5:10] but we know it from the bottom of our
[5:12] heart all the way through this world is
[5:13] not our home
[5:14] and there's no place of rest here and
[5:16] here we have no continuing city
[5:18] and god is doing a good job for me he's
[5:21] doing a good job of getting me to that
[5:22] place
[5:23] and i thank him for it it's his great
[5:25] mercy for us
[5:27] amen as we uh look into this word
[5:30] let's just start here at first peter 1
[5:33] verse 23.
[5:40] verse uh chapter 1 verse 23 being born
[5:42] again not of corruptible seed but of
[5:44] incorruptible
[5:45] by the word of god which liveth and
[5:48] abideth
[5:49] forever born again not of corruptable
[5:52] seed that was our first birth
[5:53] but of incorruptable we're born of an
[5:56] incorruptible seed
[5:58] by the word of god which liveth and
[6:01] abideth
[6:02] forever let's bow our heads and pray
[6:05] lord jesus we thank you for this word
[6:07] god we just asked that
[6:09] you would have your way with us that you
[6:11] would move upon us in a special way
[6:14] lord we're gathered together in an
[6:16] unusual format lord but
[6:18] while we're just seeking your leadership
[6:20] and your wisdom and all that we do
[6:21] and asking that you would just anoint us
[6:24] lord
[6:25] god to receive from you what you have
[6:26] for us today
[6:28] speak lord through these lips of clay
[6:30] deliver your word lord
[6:31] through an imperfect vessel may you
[6:33] deliver a perfect word
[6:35] and lord may it bring a perfect life to
[6:38] your waiting children
[6:40] we love you father and we ask that you
[6:41] would have your mercy bless those that
[6:43] are home
[6:44] lord bless those that are recovering
[6:45] lord we just pray that you would speed
[6:47] up the process
[6:48] that you would quicken them and
[6:49] strengthen them lord and help everyone
[6:51] to feel well and strong and healthy
[6:53] and lord we look forward to the day lord
[6:55] when you gather us all home
[6:57] we love you god and we ask for your
[6:59] blessings in jesus christ's name
[7:01] amen god bless you as you're seated i
[7:04] also want to remind everybody
[7:05] of the prayer times we've made no change
[7:07] to the prayer times there's
[7:08] there's no restrictions there so the
[7:10] prayer times are still friday from one
[7:12] to five
[7:13] saturday from five to ten here in the
[7:14] sanctuary it'll be open there was
[7:16] several that still gathered for prayer
[7:18] but i noticed the numbers were down
[7:20] and one let everybody to know that
[7:21] there's no restriction there it's very
[7:23] easy for us to have a time of prayer
[7:25] we just slip in one at a time find a
[7:27] separated place pray and slip out
[7:29] so that that can continue on with no
[7:32] changes
[7:32] so if you want to come join us for that
[7:34] friday one to five saturday five to ten
[7:37] as usual and as we as we think about
[7:42] the the place that we're in this is so
[7:44] unusual you know in my life i've never
[7:46] seen
[7:47] anything like what's going on in the
[7:48] world right now but as i meditate on it
[7:51] and reflect i realize that god is
[7:53] extending another hand of mercy to this
[7:55] world
[7:56] and they're receiving another hand of
[7:58] mercy a great hand of mercy
[8:00] because god has has created a a pandemic
[8:04] a scare
[8:04] throughout the whole world that is
[8:06] causing people to reflect on their
[8:08] mortality
[8:09] in a in a way that most people haven't
[8:11] reflected on it
[8:12] in fact i think it's amazing that that
[8:15] so many people
[8:16] hate their lives i mean you work with
[8:18] people
[8:19] we're out and about we hear comments and
[8:21] so many people are dissatisfied with
[8:23] their lives they're miserable
[8:24] every day they don't like where they
[8:26] work sometimes they don't like who
[8:28] they're married to they don't like
[8:29] you know where they live they don't have
[8:31] enough money they don't have enough of
[8:32] this
[8:33] and they're totally dissatisfied with
[8:34] life but all of a sudden when
[8:36] when their life comes in jeopardy or
[8:38] there's a threat to it they go
[8:40] through extreme measures to try to save
[8:41] the life they're not even satisfied with
[8:45] you know it's to me it's mind-boggling
[8:47] that what people will go through the
[8:49] extreme measures and the
[8:50] fear and paranoia to save something they
[8:53] didn't value before
[8:55] they would complain about it and speak
[8:57] negative about it and all of these
[8:59] things but now
[9:00] now they're paranoid to lose what they
[9:02] didn't even like
[9:05] i say oh god what mercy he's granted to
[9:08] them to think about their life and think
[9:10] about mortality
[9:11] and quit complaining for a minute and
[9:13] and think about god and think about
[9:15] eternal life and think about the future
[9:17] and what happens if we die amen god has
[9:20] given the world an
[9:21] opportunity to reflect on their
[9:22] mortality and then he's taken
[9:25] all the families and put them back
[9:26] together
[9:28] amen you know most so many people were
[9:31] out of work they said
[9:33] 90 of the americans are under a
[9:35] stay-at-home order amen
[9:36] and a majority of them are working from
[9:39] home or lost their jobs and now
[9:40] you have mom and dad back home with the
[9:43] kids again there's no school
[9:45] and they're back home and they're not
[9:46] going to sporting events and they're not
[9:48] running the practices and they're not
[9:50] doing
[9:50] dance and music lessons and all these
[9:52] activities
[9:53] they're back home amen god this is an
[9:56] act of mercy if the world spurns this
[9:58] opportunity
[9:59] i don't know that they'll get another
[10:00] one what more can god do
[10:02] amen god can make you face your life
[10:05] make you face
[10:06] mortality and then put the family back
[10:08] together and say this is the way it's
[10:10] supposed to be
[10:11] think about me and come back together
[10:13] amen and if we come out of this going
[10:15] right back to where we were and the
[10:17] world goes right
[10:18] back to where it was god cannot be held
[10:20] accountable
[10:22] he has done all that he can do amen
[10:25] most people see this as a terrible thing
[10:27] this is god's mercy and grace to the
[10:29] world
[10:31] no the whole world is affected the whole
[10:33] world is talking about the whole world
[10:34] is thinking about it
[10:35] and may some awaken may something inside
[10:39] come to life and awaken and make people
[10:41] realize
[10:41] that there is a god in heaven and the
[10:43] way we're going is not right
[10:46] amen people have
[10:50] more time now than they've ever had
[10:54] to pray to think about god
[10:57] to spend with their families i said god
[11:00] let it not be wasted
[11:02] let it not be wasted but accomplish that
[11:04] purpose
[11:06] so god is good
[11:10] through every obstacle every trial god
[11:13] is doing multiple things he's
[11:15] he's manifesting himself in many ways
[11:17] and he's accomplishing many goals at the
[11:19] same time
[11:20] and it's hard to out-figure god or
[11:22] figure what he's doing but he knows
[11:24] he absolutely knows what he's doing and
[11:27] and may accomplish all of his work and
[11:29] may accomplish it in us
[11:30] whatever he's trying to do in us may it
[11:32] be accomplished whatever he's trying to
[11:34] do and this is individuals whatever he's
[11:36] trying to do in me
[11:37] i want it to be accomplished right now i
[11:39] don't want to breeze through this time
[11:40] and have missed what he's trying to tell
[11:42] me
[11:42] what i'm trying to learn and he's trying
[11:45] to teach me i want to learn it
[11:47] and so when i today for a title i just i
[11:50] want to talk about
[11:51] resurrection of the original life
[11:53] resurrection of the original life and if
[11:56] you think about two weeks ago
[11:58] we were all gathered here two weeks ago
[12:00] on sunday and uh
[12:01] i preached on the move of the spirit and
[12:03] i want to continue this thought on from
[12:05] there and i'll do a little bit of
[12:07] review from that some of the things we
[12:08] pulled together from there and then move
[12:10] from that with some of the thoughts i
[12:12] didn't get to share
[12:13] but when we look at first peter it says
[12:15] that we're being born again not of
[12:17] corruptible seed
[12:18] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[12:22] so there's the new birth is not like the
[12:24] old birth
[12:25] your original birth your your first your
[12:27] natural birth i should say
[12:29] came by corruptable seed it was already
[12:31] corrupted by the fall in the garden
[12:33] but we're to be born again of
[12:35] incorruptible seed
[12:36] by the word of god praise god so that
[12:39] word of god amen and the spirit of god
[12:41] is bringing a birth
[12:43] amen of the incorruptible seed but in
[12:46] order to have a birth of the
[12:47] incorruptable seed
[12:48] there must already be an incorruptible
[12:50] seed present yes
[12:53] yeah amen so we know that let's turn to
[12:56] genesis chapter one and look at genesis
[12:58] 1
[12:59] and verse 1. i'd say this is probably
[13:06] one of the most
[13:07] unusual easter services i've ever been
[13:09] in
[13:11] because in the for this easter service
[13:14] the men have separated from their
[13:16] families easter is traditionally a
[13:18] family time
[13:19] or here at church the children aren't
[13:21] with us the wives aren't with us
[13:23] i mean it's everything is different
[13:25] everything is unusual
[13:27] everything has changed and you realize
[13:29] god is breaking
[13:30] every tradition in the whole world
[13:34] god is breaking everything amen the the
[13:37] the pope is presenting a uh easter mass
[13:39] to an empty basilica
[13:41] he's breaking every tradition amen he's
[13:43] breaking family traditions he's breaking
[13:45] national traditions
[13:47] he's breaking church traditions i don't
[13:49] think god is interested in our
[13:51] traditions
[13:52] i don't think he's interested in what we
[13:54] normally do on easter or what is our
[13:56] family tradition or what we normally
[13:58] think should be accomplished
[13:59] amen god's going to break everything in
[14:01] our own thinking he's going to break
[14:02] everything in the world's thinking and
[14:04] he's going to have his way
[14:05] and god is powerful enough he can break
[14:08] anything he wants to break
[14:09] and he will break it and he will shatter
[14:11] it until there's no more of man no more
[14:13] of man's ideas and man's traditions but
[14:15] it's going to be his word and his word
[14:17] only
[14:19] and pray praise god it's unusual it's
[14:21] strange
[14:22] but praise god if this is where we're at
[14:24] this is where we're at let god be god
[14:26] and let his way be my ways
[14:28] and if if i have to lose some of my
[14:30] tradition let it go
[14:32] just let it go just let me live the life
[14:34] he wants me to live
[14:35] and whatever position he puts me in let
[14:37] me just shine the light of the gospel
[14:39] wherever he plants me
[14:40] let me bloom in that that that situation
[14:43] in that field
[14:45] in genesis 1 is where we were two weeks
[14:47] ago we started genesis 1
[14:49] verse 1. in the beginning god created
[14:52] the heaven and the earth
[14:53] and brother branham explains to us that
[14:55] there was a previous civilization on the
[14:56] earth there was
[14:57] there was trees there was nature there
[15:00] was a civilization and something had
[15:02] happened and now
[15:03] the world after this creation between
[15:05] genesis 1 verse 1 and
[15:07] 1 verse 2 there's a destruction that
[15:09] sets in because of something that
[15:11] happened upon the
[15:12] earth and now we find in verse 2 the
[15:14] world under judgment
[15:15] and the earth was without form and void
[15:17] and darkness was upon the face of the
[15:19] deep
[15:20] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[15:22] face of the waters and god said and let
[15:24] there be light
[15:25] and there was light so we find that now
[15:28] the world because of
[15:29] judgment is thrown into chaos and and
[15:32] it's without form and it's void and
[15:34] darkness is upon the face of the deep
[15:36] and the spirit of god moved and so this
[15:38] is the first time
[15:40] that that in the scripture account we
[15:42] see the spirit of god move
[15:44] and when the spirit of god moved what
[15:45] did the spirit of god move
[15:47] what was the move of the spirit to
[15:49] accomplish the moving of the spirit
[15:51] was to bring the word into manifestation
[15:54] he said let there be light and there was
[15:56] light and brother benham described
[15:58] how the holy ghost was was cooing amen
[16:01] as a
[16:01] brooding over the earth amen and his god
[16:04] spoke his word
[16:05] the holy ghost was brooding over the
[16:07] earth to bring that word into
[16:08] manifestation
[16:10] and when the light began to shine and
[16:12] the waters began to part
[16:13] he said there was seeds that was already
[16:15] laying down there from a previous
[16:17] civilization
[16:18] and he knew that those were germatized
[16:20] seeds and all they needed was the light
[16:23] and when the light struck
[16:24] them amen they would come to life so the
[16:26] holy ghost began to brood
[16:28] and begin to bring the separation of
[16:30] waters amen
[16:31] and begin to let the light strike the
[16:33] soil and begin to when he says let the
[16:35] uh
[16:36] the grass bring forth and the trees
[16:37] bring forth they were bringing forth
[16:39] what was already there
[16:40] so the holy ghost was brooding over what
[16:43] was already there
[16:44] to bring it into manifestation so the
[16:47] move of the holy ghost is there
[16:49] to move the word to advance the word to
[16:52] to nurture and bring forth the word into
[16:54] manifestation
[16:55] and so the holy ghost comes upon us to
[16:57] do what to bring the word to life and to
[17:00] bring it into manifestation
[17:03] amen it's it's not like in a in a
[17:06] pentecostal denominational idea
[17:08] that the move of the spirit is just
[17:10] there to make us excited many times
[17:12] seeing the spirit of god move
[17:13] is exciting it's a thrill amen to see
[17:16] god move
[17:17] amen to feel his presence to see
[17:19] something and feel something tangible
[17:21] it's an absolute thrill to us and we
[17:23] love it and we should never
[17:24] lose our enthusiasm for that
[17:27] but the move of the spirit is to bring
[17:30] the man the word into manifestation
[17:33] to brood over brood over the seed
[17:37] amen and bring it up amen and where it
[17:40] bears fruit and brings full
[17:41] manifestation
[17:42] and brother brahman says that god's
[17:44] provided a place of worship as i said
[17:46] the other day when god moved and struck
[17:48] the sun across the earth
[17:49] he knowed them palm trees and everything
[17:51] was laying down under the earth
[17:53] they were part of the earth at that time
[17:55] so were you
[17:57] and when he raised up the son of god on
[17:59] easter morning and sent forth the holy
[18:01] spirit
[18:01] it was to quicken also the seed of
[18:04] eternal life
[18:04] that he foreknew before the foundation
[18:07] of the world that would be here
[18:09] so god already knew that there was a
[18:11] seed of eternal life
[18:13] amen that's why amen he
[18:16] that the father draws half life amen
[18:19] that's why they that believe
[18:21] amen already half life they already had
[18:24] life amen so so many times we talk amen
[18:27] amen
[18:28] we we catch terms and these terms aren't
[18:31] wrong terms amen
[18:32] but but we say we receive life we do
[18:34] receive
[18:35] life we receive life to quicken the life
[18:38] it's life coming to life amen amen it's
[18:41] it's
[18:41] it's an impartation of life because
[18:43] there's already life laying there
[18:45] waiting to spring forth into life
[18:48] so so you have to already have life amen
[18:52] there was an eternal seed
[18:53] already there just like when god said
[18:55] let there be light
[18:56] amen god wasn't speaking amen and
[18:59] bringing a manifestation of light
[19:01] just to prove that i can make light
[19:04] there's been no
[19:05] god has not performed anything in his
[19:07] word amen just
[19:09] just to perform everything has a purpose
[19:11] amen
[19:12] and god said let there be light amen
[19:14] because he knew
[19:15] that there was seeds already laying
[19:17] there and he had to bring the light and
[19:20] he's typing in natural what's going to
[19:22] happen
[19:22] spiritually for us because he knows
[19:24] there's an eternal seed laying there
[19:26] there's eternal life
[19:27] already there and it takes the light of
[19:29] the full power the gospel of god's word
[19:32] to quicken that seed to life
[19:35] and so it's already there just has to be
[19:39] quickened to life
[19:40] in god's power to transform he says
[19:42] there he died and everything that was
[19:44] spoke of him in his death
[19:46] was fulfilled to bring light and life to
[19:49] all the predestinated seed of god that
[19:51] was upon the earth
[19:52] he brought the way to do it here is the
[19:55] seed
[19:55] the spirit brings the life transforming
[19:58] sons and daughters of god
[19:59] from the world in this dark chaos to be
[20:02] the sons
[20:03] and daughters of god
[20:06] let's go to galatians chapter 4 together
[20:21] galatians chapter 4 and verse 6. we're
[20:25] just going to read one
[20:27] portion here galatians 4 and 6. and
[20:31] because you are sons
[20:33] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[20:35] into your hearts crying abba father
[20:38] so the because you are sons
[20:42] god has sent the spirit of his son into
[20:44] your hearts grabbing out of a father
[20:45] he didn't send the spirit to your heart
[20:48] to make you a son he sent the spirit
[20:51] into your heart because you were sons
[20:54] amen what a powerful thing that we've
[20:57] learned in this day
[20:58] by the preaching of the prophet in this
[21:00] day to shed the light on this
[21:02] that that we've already were sons from
[21:04] before the foundation of the world
[21:06] before there was a molecule a speck of
[21:08] anything created we already were sons
[21:10] already had eternal life we're already
[21:12] predetermined and predestined to be
[21:14] here in a body of flesh amen to manifest
[21:17] his word
[21:17] but because of a fall in the garden now
[21:21] the earth is shrouded in darkness and
[21:23] overshadowed and we come into the world
[21:25] covered in darkness and the seed is
[21:27] covered in darkness because our minds
[21:29] are darkened and alienated against the
[21:31] things of god
[21:33] because of the judgment that we're under
[21:35] because of the fall
[21:36] we're born in judgment this earth amen
[21:38] comes out
[21:39] amen under a judgment and covered in
[21:41] darkness but
[21:42] god knows there's seeds there and
[21:44] because god predestinated the seed there
[21:47] it's god's responsibility to work
[21:50] everything out to make sure the light
[21:52] strikes that seed
[21:53] so that it can come to life and fulfill
[21:55] the purpose he purposed from before the
[21:57] foundation of the world
[21:59] amen that's why if there's any if
[22:01] there's a seed there
[22:02] god knows that seeds there and god has
[22:05] to get the light to that seed
[22:06] it's his responsibility that's why he
[22:09] sends his spirit upon the earth to take
[22:11] his
[22:11] spoken word and bring it to pass amen to
[22:14] part the waters
[22:15] to shine the light to bring up the seed
[22:18] to do everything that has to be done
[22:20] to make us manifested sons and daughters
[22:22] of god it's his responsibility
[22:24] not ours amen and if god has done that
[22:28] for us
[22:28] amen it's because we were with him
[22:30] before the foundation of the world
[22:32] it had nothing to do with our merit
[22:34] while we were lost it had nothing to do
[22:36] with our conduct
[22:37] it had nothing to do with our will and
[22:38] our desire or any
[22:40] of that it had everything to do with his
[22:42] predestinated plan
[22:43] amen there was already eternal life
[22:45] there and he had to bring it into
[22:47] manifestation and he did
[22:50] amen why was there a prophetic ministry
[22:52] through the 40s and 50s and 60s
[22:55] why such supernatural events took place
[22:57] on this earth
[22:58] why was there a ministry that was
[22:59] recorded like no ministry has ever been
[23:02] recorded amen
[23:03] because i was going to be here in this
[23:05] day and he knew it before the foundation
[23:07] of the world
[23:08] because you were going to be here in
[23:09] this day and he had to bring it in the
[23:11] manifestation
[23:12] and the only way he could is for that
[23:14] light to strike that seed
[23:16] and this earth and it has to come to
[23:18] life
[23:19] and then he continues to brood over us
[23:22] amen to make sure
[23:23] that that seed keeps growing into the
[23:25] restoration of the bride's tree
[23:27] until it bears the same fruit that he
[23:29] bore
[23:30] it's his work and his responsibility
[23:33] it's his life
[23:36] you realize that seed of eternal life
[23:39] that's the real you that's the real you
[23:44] but that real you is really him
[23:50] it's him it's a portion of him
[23:53] that he calls son or daughter
[23:56] but it's him who is jesus christ jesus
[23:59] christ
[24:00] was god in the form of sign it was god
[24:03] as a son amen and that attribute that
[24:06] portion of god
[24:07] that is in you it's him but it's really
[24:10] you
[24:10] and it's the real genuine you and the
[24:12] real genuine you is him
[24:14] [Applause]
[24:16] that's why there's nothing to worry
[24:18] about amen there's nothing to be afraid
[24:21] of
[24:21] there's nothing to fret over god is in
[24:24] absolute control of everything
[24:25] because it's him amen our minds amen
[24:29] are still amen still subject to the
[24:32] things of the world and carnality that's
[24:34] why we must have the mind of christ
[24:36] but it's that life on the inside that's
[24:38] the real genuine
[24:40] us which is him
[24:42] [Applause]
[24:44] and there's nothing to be afraid of he's
[24:46] not going to lose that seed
[24:47] amen and nothing's going to happen
[24:50] nothing's going to happen out of his
[24:51] plan
[24:52] see when we get into situations where
[24:54] our world's in chaos and
[24:56] losing work and people getting sick and
[24:58] in regulations and
[25:00] and laws and confusion everywhere amen
[25:02] there's nothing to worry about
[25:05] god has a habit of bringing life out of
[25:07] chaos
[25:09] go all the way back to genesis 1 2. he's
[25:12] got a habit of bringing life
[25:14] out of chaos he has a habit of
[25:17] disrupting everything
[25:18] so that his perfect plan can come into
[25:20] manifestation and if god is going to
[25:22] disrupt this world
[25:23] then let him disrupt the world if it's
[25:25] going to disrupt my ideas
[25:27] let my ideas be disrupted if it's going
[25:29] to disrupt my family gathering for
[25:31] easter
[25:32] let it be disrupted because when god
[25:34] disrupts the world
[25:35] it's for his purpose
[25:39] amen i say god just shatter our thinking
[25:43] and have your way
[25:45] this is this is the day where you have
[25:48] to know who you are
[25:50] there's no option anymore friends you
[25:53] have to know who you are and you have to
[25:54] know who you belong to
[25:57] because things are uncertain they'll get
[25:59] more uncertain
[26:00] that's for certain things are in chaos
[26:04] still can get more chaotic
[26:06] they can get much much worse than this
[26:09] you have to know
[26:10] who you are you have to know what is
[26:12] that life on the inside
[26:14] is it just me with an idea and a hope
[26:17] and
[26:18] or is it something far beyond that
[26:20] there's something so
[26:21] real inside of me something moving me
[26:24] something genuine
[26:25] something from before the foundation
[26:26] world that i can't explain
[26:28] i can't take out and measure i can't
[26:30] show a certificate
[26:31] i can't give you any proof but there's
[26:32] something in me that's moving me
[26:35] there's something in me that's not
[26:36] that's not the carnal part of me
[26:38] that's real and genuine and taking
[26:40] control
[26:42] it's got to be that way friends
[26:45] praise god brother bam says
[26:48] in the rising of the sun now as the sun
[26:51] was sent across the earth
[26:52] not to bring rocks which was dirt also
[26:54] to life it was not to bring all the dirt
[26:56] to light but it was to bring the part of
[26:57] the dirt which was enclosed around the
[26:59] life
[27:00] he's talking about you he's talking
[27:03] about you
[27:03] a part of the dirt that's enclosed
[27:05] around a life amen and the life is
[27:08] already there
[27:08] and the dirt is just dead dirt of the
[27:11] earth amen but it's the life inside
[27:13] that's going to make the dirt manifest
[27:15] the word
[27:18] not all men will receive christ oh no
[27:21] but those which god for ordained
[27:23] to life is housed around some of the
[27:25] dirt of the earth that's the one he
[27:26] comes to quicken
[27:27] they're the ones that now that dirt
[27:30] would lay there in the sun and say oh
[27:32] this old sun is so hot that rock say
[27:34] this old sun is so hot
[27:35] but that little seed said that's what
[27:37] i'm looking for
[27:39] that's why you know you come to the
[27:41] sometimes and and the preaching is hot
[27:44] the sun is hot amen and the dirt says
[27:48] oh that's hot that hurts
[27:51] amen but the seed says that's what i'm
[27:53] looking for
[27:54] that's what i'm looking for
[27:58] the old sun is so hot but the little
[28:00] seed said that's what i'm looking for
[28:02] and he began to spring forth the life it
[28:03] quickened that part of the dirt because
[28:05] the sun was sent to quicken the
[28:07] was was not to quicken the rock not to
[28:10] quicken the dirt
[28:11] but to quicken the life of the seed
[28:14] so that means in that seed in your soul
[28:17] was a germ of life
[28:18] was life eternal life and it took life
[28:21] to quicken the life it took the word
[28:25] to bring forth the word it took the
[28:27] spirit to unlock the spirit
[28:29] you realize it's all the same thing it's
[28:31] two parts of the same thing
[28:33] counterparts of the same thing
[28:37] we have to understand that amen or else
[28:39] we think something else came to me
[28:41] and made me something different no you
[28:44] were something different on the outside
[28:47] but down on the inside whatever came to
[28:49] you you were a reflection of that
[28:52] whatever it was that came to quick in
[28:54] that life amen was the same thing that
[28:56] that life is made out of and come from
[28:57] the same source
[29:02] so it's not different it's the same
[29:06] amen brother bam says in broken cisterns
[29:10] no pumping up its powers within itself
[29:13] it needs no priming yes sir for itself
[29:16] its own life is in itself
[29:17] that's the way the seed of god is on a
[29:19] man's heart
[29:20] that's the way seed of god is in a man's
[29:22] heart the life of god is within the
[29:25] individual
[29:28] not in the church
[29:31] in you it's in you you're the one that
[29:34] has the germ of life
[29:35] in you that's why this is a good day to
[29:40] remember it's not in the church
[29:43] most of our congregation is not in the
[29:45] church they are the church
[29:48] and the life isn't in the building the
[29:50] life is in the building
[29:51] of his children the tabernacles of flesh
[29:53] that he's dwelling in
[29:54] amen that's where they're housing the
[29:56] life amen
[29:57] and you have the germ the individual
[30:00] you've got the life
[30:01] amen that's why when god breaks breaks
[30:04] apart fellowship he's going to break it
[30:05] completely apart one day one day it's
[30:08] going to be totally
[30:09] completely broke apart the doors will be
[30:11] closed we won't be able to gather
[30:13] in this church anymore but it won't
[30:15] change the life one drop
[30:17] and you don't have to go anywhere to get
[30:19] the life the life was in you before the
[30:21] foundation of the world
[30:22] you didn't have to arrive somewhere to
[30:24] get it or to get another portion of it
[30:26] amen it's already there the full
[30:28] potential of the seed
[30:29] whatever that seed will be is in the
[30:31] seed and was always in the seed
[30:34] that's why when brother branham said you
[30:36] go out to the ocean and you take a
[30:37] teaspoon and dip out some of the ocean
[30:39] everything that's in the ocean is in
[30:41] your teaspoon
[30:42] only in a portion and he said that's the
[30:46] way
[30:46] that you are if the spirit of god is
[30:48] living inside of you
[30:50] you've got a portion amen and whatever
[30:52] god is and capable of he's capable of
[30:54] in you amen because it's him
[30:58] in you you don't have to go somewhere
[31:01] and get it it's already there it just
[31:04] has to be unlocked it has to be drawn
[31:06] out
[31:06] it has to be coming to manifestation
[31:10] so god will allow every terrible
[31:12] circumstance that you can name in the
[31:14] book
[31:14] to come to draw out that life because
[31:16] it's already there
[31:18] he says how do you get the fragrance how
[31:20] do you get the oil out of a rose
[31:22] he said you crush it amen he didn't put
[31:25] any fragrance in it he had to get it out
[31:28] he didn't put any oil in it he had to
[31:30] get it out and in order to get it out
[31:32] he had to crush it amen it's already
[31:34] there
[31:35] but sometimes it takes a trial to get it
[31:37] to come out
[31:38] sometimes it takes a change in
[31:39] circumstances to get it to come out
[31:44] amen praise be to god
[31:48] brother said every apple that's hanging
[31:50] on an apple tree was in it when it was
[31:52] in seed form
[31:55] praise god it's in you
[31:58] it is the rising of the sun he says the
[32:00] real eagle recognizes the call of god's
[32:02] word why
[32:03] he's an eagle a eagle to an
[32:06] eagle the word before the foundation
[32:11] the word to the word the word
[32:14] predestinated
[32:15] to the word written for the hour you
[32:18] realize your position
[32:20] it's a wake-up call the eagle got a
[32:23] wake-up call because
[32:24] he was an eagle you got a wake-up call
[32:27] because you were a sieging of god you
[32:30] heard this word
[32:31] others heard it and all they could say
[32:33] was that's so hot
[32:36] but something in you said that's what
[32:38] i'm looking for
[32:40] that's what i want
[32:43] in the thinking man's filter it says
[32:46] notice the word cannot deny itself
[32:47] then it is satisfied or it's the desire
[32:49] it's a desire of what
[32:51] what made you desire in the first place
[32:53] because down in your soul there was a
[32:54] predestinated seed which
[32:56] was eternal life always laying in there
[32:59] always was there see
[33:02] you realize we're coming to maturity
[33:06] under the preaching of the gospel
[33:07] brother branham came not so that we
[33:09] would have a denominational idea of
[33:11] things
[33:12] but so that we would go back to the
[33:13] original understanding
[33:15] and go back to our origins and that's
[33:17] why when i'm preaching the resurrection
[33:18] of original life
[33:19] amen you in order to have a resurrection
[33:22] the first has to be a death but what's
[33:24] resurrected
[33:25] is the original life amen
[33:28] and so now we've got to die amen but
[33:31] not that eternal life can't die it can
[33:34] never die
[33:35] it was never going to die it was never
[33:37] predestinated to die but this outer
[33:39] shell
[33:40] has got to die amen the the wrong nature
[33:43] coming through the wrong birth
[33:44] has got to die so that there can be a
[33:46] resurrection of the original life
[33:48] that was in god before the foundation of
[33:50] the world
[33:54] amen brother bram says in the rising of
[33:56] the sun because i live you live also
[33:58] speaking to his wife
[33:59] because i live ye live also what a
[34:02] resurrection that was
[34:03] water resurrection this is to be
[34:06] quickened from the dead
[34:08] to be made alive in christ jesus by
[34:10] god's quickening power
[34:12] amen is this your resurrection amen this
[34:16] is our resurrection
[34:17] they call this resurrection sunday and a
[34:19] lot of people will just reflect
[34:21] back on what was done two thousand years
[34:23] ago what was done two thousand years ago
[34:25] amen was the rising of the sun so that
[34:28] the spirit could come back
[34:29] upon the seeds that were laying under
[34:31] the judgment of the earth so that it
[34:33] could spring to life
[34:34] and manifest what's always been laying
[34:36] there it wasn't so we could always look
[34:38] back and say
[34:39] he died at calvary he died at calvary of
[34:41] course he died at calvary and paid the
[34:42] price of my redemption
[34:44] but he had to bring a price and he had
[34:46] to bring a blood that would cleanse
[34:48] amen so that he can cleanse and sanctify
[34:50] so that he can indwell
[34:53] and we can keep looking back and looking
[34:56] back and
[34:57] the whole world is looking back amen
[34:59] they're looking back and having a little
[35:00] ceremony sprinkling a little water
[35:02] and saying a few words in latin and
[35:04] talking about jesus died so that we
[35:05] could be saved
[35:06] but not realizing that there has to be a
[35:08] resurrection today
[35:10] that resurrection was only to pave the
[35:12] way for my resurrection
[35:14] and your resurrection and there still
[35:16] has to be a resurrection
[35:17] let this be a real resurrection sunday
[35:20] where somebody here or somebody on the
[35:22] internet
[35:23] will resurrect and spring to life amen
[35:26] because there's a seed there just
[35:28] waiting for the conditions to get
[35:30] right for the holy ghost to bring the
[35:32] parting of the water
[35:33] and bring the word upon the sea and may
[35:35] it happen today
[35:36] may this be your resurrection today
[35:39] may there be life come forward what life
[35:42] the life that's always been there
[35:44] waiting for the sun to shine
[35:48] amen this isn't a tradition amen let it
[35:50] never be a tradition
[35:52] amen may it be a resurrection and every
[35:54] time that light shines
[35:56] oh may it bring a fresh burst of life a
[35:59] new growth and new fruit popping out on
[36:01] the tree
[36:02] never get away from resurrection life
[36:05] because he lives i live i lived when he
[36:09] lives
[36:10] amen i've always lived because he's
[36:11] always been alive
[36:14] but now it's time amen for the
[36:16] resurrecting life to be on display
[36:18] [Applause]
[36:20] hallelujah not a tradition let god break
[36:23] the traditions
[36:25] amen praise be to god
[36:29] let's go to ephesians chapter 2.
[36:40] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1
[36:48] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[36:50] in trespasses and sins
[36:54] amen you're laying there dead no signs
[36:57] of life
[36:59] now that doesn't mean there wasn't
[37:00] eternal life there it was there but it
[37:02] was in a dead state
[37:04] no signs of life it was dead
[37:07] brother brenham he would begin to say
[37:09] that underneath that water
[37:11] on that that first day of creation in
[37:13] genesis 1
[37:14] 2 he said those seeds were already
[37:16] germatized
[37:18] and that you came already a german thy
[37:20] seed
[37:22] so there was life there but it was in a
[37:24] dead state
[37:25] the wrong life was being portrayed
[37:30] and you had the quickened who were dead
[37:32] in trespasses and sins where in time
[37:33] past you walked according to the course
[37:35] of
[37:36] this world according to the prince of
[37:38] the power of the air
[37:39] the spirit that now worketh in the
[37:41] children of disobedience
[37:43] among whom also we all had our
[37:44] conversation in times past
[37:46] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[37:49] desires of the flesh
[37:50] and of the mind and we're by nature the
[37:52] children of wrath even as others
[37:54] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[37:56] great love wherewith he loved us
[37:58] even when we were dead in sins hath
[38:00] quickened us together with
[38:02] christ by grace you are saved and hath
[38:05] raised us up together and made us to sit
[38:07] together
[38:08] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[38:12] amen verse 5 even when we were dead in
[38:15] sins
[38:16] amen sins are an attribute of unbelief
[38:21] we're laying their dead in unbelief
[38:23] ignorant to the things of god
[38:25] not knowing them amen and we have
[38:27] attributes of that unbelief
[38:30] hallelujah but when that deadness of
[38:33] unbelief and the deadness of sin
[38:35] amen is taken away amen and the
[38:37] quickening power of god comes and brings
[38:39] us the revelation of jesus christ
[38:41] the mystery made known to us in this
[38:43] hour now there's a springing forth of
[38:45] life
[38:46] and there must be new attributes on
[38:48] display attributes not of sin
[38:50] but attributes of faith not of unbelief
[38:53] but of faith
[38:54] and now it brings a different life and a
[38:56] different manifestation because the life
[38:58] we lived before
[38:59] were the attributes of sin or unbelief
[39:01] but now faith has sprung up in our
[39:03] hearts amen it's been quickened to us
[39:05] made alive and awake and now there's got
[39:07] to be a different set of attributes on
[39:08] display
[39:09] and there are attributes that come from
[39:11] faith not unbelief
[39:14] but in order to be quickened you have to
[39:16] first be dead
[39:19] i mean it seems like such a simple it
[39:22] seems simple
[39:23] but i think it gets missed so many times
[39:26] in order to be made alive you have to
[39:28] first be reckoned dead
[39:32] that's why i feel like we have too many
[39:35] alive people trying to be alive
[39:38] right we need dead people made alive
[39:42] dead to self dead to carnality dead to
[39:45] flesh
[39:46] dead to the first birth the natural
[39:48] birth dead to all of that
[39:49] so that we can really be alive because
[39:52] you can't do both at the same time
[39:56] brother bam says and the greater than
[39:57] solomon is here in 1962 if you want to
[40:00] be a christian
[40:01] you be born again die to yourself
[40:04] and start from the bottom and come forth
[40:06] there won't be no blow ups along the
[40:08] road
[40:09] you'll be able to hold the charge that
[40:10] the holy ghost puts in you that's right
[40:12] if you don't you'll never be able to
[40:14] stand that that's all the lord bless you
[40:16] that's a rude thing to say isn't it but
[40:18] i hope you get what i'm talking about
[40:20] i believe that you've got to die so dead
[40:23] till you're no more yourself
[40:26] he's talking about your your natural
[40:29] birth your natural man
[40:31] you're no more yourself that's all and
[40:33] then be born again
[40:34] new a new creature in christ built from
[40:36] the very bottom of your soul
[40:39] all the way through a real born-again
[40:41] christian then the holy spirit knows
[40:43] what kind of load to put in you
[40:44] that's right you'll be able to pack it
[40:47] let's go to matthew 28 i want to read a
[40:49] couple scriptures
[40:50] in sequence
[40:58] matthew 28 and 5.
[41:07] matthew 28 5 and the angel answered and
[41:09] said unto the woman fear not
[41:11] for you know that you seek jesus who was
[41:13] crucified
[41:14] he is not here for he has risen as he
[41:16] said come see the place
[41:18] where the lord lay and go quickly and
[41:20] tell his disciples that he has risen
[41:22] from the dead and behold he goes before
[41:24] you unto galilee
[41:25] there shall you see him lo i have
[41:28] no i have told you in order to have a
[41:32] resurrection
[41:33] you have to have a death even in the
[41:36] original resurrection of jesus christ
[41:38] you had to have a death
[41:40] to have a resurrection and and he says
[41:42] and the angel says go tell his disciples
[41:44] that he has risen
[41:45] from the dead and i say today if we're
[41:48] going to have a resurrection we've got
[41:50] to start with a death
[41:52] and if you want to be resurrected in the
[41:54] newness of life
[41:55] amen don't be afraid to be dead it's
[41:58] time now to be dead
[42:00] and then if we can see the world's
[42:01] conditions it's time amen we say you
[42:03] know what
[42:04] this world is not my home amen i've been
[42:06] afraid to be dead because still some
[42:08] things i wanted
[42:09] some still some plans i had still some
[42:12] likes that i had
[42:13] but it's time to let those things die
[42:18] let's go to romans chapter 6.
[42:25] romans chapter 6
[42:29] and verse 3 know you not that so many of
[42:33] us were baptized into jesus christ were
[42:35] baptized
[42:36] into his death therefore we are buried
[42:38] with him by baptism unto death
[42:40] that like as christ was raised up from
[42:42] the dead by the glory of the father even
[42:44] so we also should walk in newness of
[42:46] life
[42:47] for if we have been planted together in
[42:49] the likeness of his death
[42:50] we shall we shall be also in the
[42:53] likeness
[42:54] of his resurrection knowing this that
[42:56] our old man is crucified with him
[42:58] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[43:00] that henceforth we should not
[43:02] serve sin if we can be planted in the
[43:05] likeness of his death
[43:06] amen if you can just let that seed be
[43:09] planted your whole life
[43:10] and let all the outside of it rot away
[43:13] and die
[43:14] amen rot away and die why because
[43:16] there's a life on the inside
[43:18] and as long as it walks around here just
[43:20] in seed form
[43:21] it can be germatized seed form friends
[43:24] but if it walks around
[43:25] amen i mean there's there's nothing on
[43:27] the inside coming to manifestation on
[43:29] the outside
[43:30] all you say there's a seed i'm a sea
[43:32] gene of god
[43:33] i'm a seed of god but what good does it
[43:35] do until you plant that seed and let
[43:38] everything around it rot and die and
[43:40] fall away
[43:41] and decay amen so that what was on the
[43:44] inside
[43:45] can come out to the outside
[43:48] so so many times we say i'm a c gene of
[43:50] god i'm a seed of god
[43:52] amen but you've got to be a manifested
[43:54] seed gene of god
[43:56] you've got to go through the process of
[43:58] dying and rotting out
[44:00] amen being planted in the likeness of
[44:02] his death
[44:03] to come forth in the likeness of his
[44:04] resurrection
[44:07] say god let everything around me die
[44:11] and rot amen so many times
[44:15] we have preaching and the preaching like
[44:16] we said sometimes is red hot and
[44:18] scorching
[44:20] and it hits you know it hits my hobbies
[44:22] sometimes it hits my likes it hits my
[44:24] fashions it hits all this
[44:26] amen and why has it always got to be
[44:28] preached like that why is it always
[44:30] every time i come to church he's talking
[44:32] about you know the thing that i enjoy
[44:34] my entertainment or my hobby or my
[44:37] fashion or my life
[44:38] amen god is trying to get you to rot
[44:41] amen
[44:42] he is trying with everything in him
[44:44] because he knows the potential that's
[44:45] laying on the inside
[44:46] and that potential is going unrealized
[44:49] as we walk around saying
[44:51] i'm a seed gene of god i'm a seed of god
[44:53] but scared to get down
[44:55] amen and be planted in the likeness of
[44:57] his death and hate
[44:58] our very lives amen until you hate your
[45:02] life you're not ready to be born again
[45:04] until you hate what you are tell you
[45:06] hate the way you think
[45:07] till you hate the way your flesh craves
[45:09] things until you absolutely are
[45:11] disgusted at your humanity
[45:13] you're not ready to be resurrected to
[45:14] life
[45:16] too many people amen are happy amen
[45:20] so much of this and so much of this a
[45:22] percentage of living for god
[45:23] and a percentage of doing my own way
[45:25] amen that's not resurrection life yet
[45:28] friends until we're planted in the
[45:30] likeness of his death how dead was he he
[45:33] was dead
[45:34] all the way dead brother branham said so
[45:36] dead till the world recognized that he
[45:38] was dead
[45:43] amen we want to be a sea gene of god
[45:46] that's fine
[45:47] but he's looking for a manifested seed
[45:49] gene of god
[45:50] he's looking for a seed gene of god amen
[45:54] a life on the inside amen but that life
[45:56] on the inside he wants to come on the
[45:58] outside
[45:59] in the original and then back in genesis
[46:01] 1 if he was just happy doing the recedes
[46:03] laying there
[46:04] and bringing satisfaction to his heart
[46:05] there's a palm tree there and an oak
[46:07] tree there
[46:08] that's not what satisfied him what
[46:10] satisfied him is when what he knew was
[46:12] laying there in a mystery came into full
[46:14] manifestation
[46:15] and began to bear fruit of the life that
[46:17] was in it that's when
[46:19] that's what satisfied him
[46:22] he's not satisfied with us saying amen
[46:24] there's a seed of god on the inside i'm
[46:26] a
[46:26] no he's satisfied when whatever he
[46:29] placed there to be manifest in this day
[46:31] has gone through the process of
[46:32] regeneration
[46:34] amen so now that it is displaying the
[46:35] very life that's on the inside
[46:40] hallelujah amen
[46:44] god will come sunday after sunday
[46:48] wednesdays
[46:49] playing tapes however it comes he'll
[46:52] come and he'll say
[46:54] rot die
[46:58] die to that thing you love so much
[47:01] what's it doing it's ruining the
[47:03] potential that's in the seed it's
[47:04] holding it back
[47:07] we want to see manifestations but we've
[47:10] got to die first
[47:13] we want to see god fully displayed in
[47:15] his full power
[47:16] but there's got to be a full rotting out
[47:18] first
[47:20] there's got to be a complete death to
[47:22] self amen
[47:23] a total abandonment for myself and dying
[47:26] into where i'm not afraid he can do with
[47:28] me what he wishes it's no longer my idea
[47:31] it's what he wants
[47:37] god may be getting us to the place
[47:39] sooner than later
[47:42] where even our desire for our job will
[47:43] be gone amen
[47:45] our income our home who knows
[47:49] maybe we'll hit such devastation and
[47:51] despair that will start living with each
[47:53] other
[47:56] don't think it can't happen the
[47:59] retirement
[48:00] wiped out mortgages called
[48:04] notes called no home to live in
[48:08] we may be packing into each other's
[48:09] houses
[48:11] talk about a close fellowship
[48:15] iron sharpened iron we're going to be
[48:17] sharp brother
[48:21] i'm not saying it will happen but i'm
[48:22] saying it can happen
[48:24] and what's happening now in the world is
[48:26] proving to us anything can happen
[48:29] god can wreck the whole system in a
[48:31] manner of weeks if he wants to
[48:33] days if he feels like it and whatever he
[48:35] wants to accomplish he will accomplish
[48:37] amen and maybe that job that we love and
[48:39] that retirement account we're banking on
[48:41] that home that we've worked so hard on
[48:43] maybe it will mean nothing in the next
[48:45] few weeks
[48:46] few months few years maybe it won't mean
[48:48] anything to us
[48:49] maybe he'll take a few more feathers out
[48:51] of the nest and throw it to the side
[48:53] so that we can say truly this world is
[48:55] not my home
[48:56] i don't care anymore about what happens
[48:58] to me all i want to do is be pleasing to
[49:00] him
[49:02] the disciples got to the place amen
[49:05] where that seed inside of them sprung to
[49:07] life
[49:07] where they didn't matter if they were
[49:08] stoned if they were beat if they were in
[49:11] prison
[49:11] if they were mocked if they were scorned
[49:13] amen if they were chased from city to
[49:15] city
[49:16] it didn't change them anymore because
[49:18] they had died
[49:19] that's what death looks like
[49:22] death doesn't look like i'll endure this
[49:24] little trial for a few days and then
[49:26] i'll go back to doing what i want to do
[49:28] amen and say i'm glad that's over that's
[49:30] not death
[49:31] death is saying if he wants to hang me
[49:33] upside down and nail me to a cross
[49:35] then that's what i want if he wants to
[49:37] strip away all my worldly goods that's
[49:39] what i want
[49:40] it's an actual death to self so that
[49:42] what's on the inside can live
[49:46] it's a big statement to make but we
[49:49] might actually get to live it sometime
[49:51] it's time to come to terms with it now
[49:56] god can do what he wants with himself
[50:02] do you realize that that was god
[50:05] in jesus christ being spit on
[50:10] being mocked and made fun of rejected
[50:13] that was gone
[50:16] who is it in you it's god
[50:21] and god can accomplish what he wants
[50:23] with himself
[50:25] the seeding of god is an attribute of
[50:27] god
[50:30] god will fulfill all his word in us
[50:35] let's go to galatians chapter 2.
[50:43] galatians chapter 2 verse 20.
[50:55] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[50:57] i live yet not i
[50:58] but christ liveth in me and the life
[51:01] which i now live in the flesh
[51:03] i live by the faith of the son of god
[51:05] who loved me and gave himself for me
[51:08] this life is to be lived in the flesh
[51:12] because this flesh is to manifest that
[51:13] life
[51:15] but we have to first be crucified with
[51:17] christ let's go to chapter five
[51:27] 5 and verse 24
[51:31] and they that are christ have crucified
[51:33] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[51:37] so we know now that in order to be
[51:41] born again we've got to die
[51:45] in order to be quickened we have to die
[51:47] in order to be resurrected
[51:49] we have to die so the goal is to die
[51:54] don't worry about coming to life he'll
[51:55] take care of that our objective is to
[51:57] die
[51:58] and to stay dead to be completely dead
[52:01] you know we have
[52:02] sometimes we have so much worry and so
[52:04] much strain on
[52:05] on on the new birth i want to be born
[52:07] again i want the baptism holy ghost
[52:09] that's something he'll do that's a gift
[52:10] we receive that by faith that's god's
[52:12] doing
[52:13] but really what we should focus on is
[52:14] dying
[52:16] spend all of our time and focus all of
[52:18] our attention on dying
[52:19] amen and let him take care of the living
[52:21] [Applause]
[52:23] we do that instead of getting the cart
[52:25] before the horse amen i want the baptism
[52:27] holy ghost
[52:27] i want the new life i want to know that
[52:29] i'm born again just make sure you're
[52:31] dead amen
[52:32] and when you think you're dead die some
[52:33] more amen when you think you've died
[52:35] some more
[52:36] die a little more he'll take care of the
[52:38] resurrection
[52:40] because it's the same spirit that raised
[52:42] him will raise you
[52:43] it's his doing it was god who sent the
[52:45] holy ghost
[52:46] to brood over the earth to bring the
[52:48] seeds to life god's the one who sent it
[52:50] now
[52:50] amen to bring it to life he'll bring it
[52:53] to life you just reckon yourself dead
[52:55] be planted in the likeness of his death
[52:57] be crucified with christ
[53:00] and let god bring life sometimes we
[53:04] focus on the wrong things in the wrong
[53:05] order
[53:06] then we get ourselves confused now it's
[53:09] time to die
[53:12] brother graham said in the rising of the
[53:13] sun he says now see now you're already
[53:16] resurrected
[53:17] when god raised him up he raised you the
[53:19] son is just now
[53:20] on you and now you're growing into a
[53:23] blossom life like he was to be
[53:25] resurrected completely in the last day
[53:27] your potentials you have now
[53:30] why do you know your soul changed didn't
[53:33] it
[53:34] your body came obedience to it didn't it
[53:37] in obedience to what a church the word
[53:40] which is
[53:40] the life when you are now resurrected
[53:43] from the dead it is
[53:44] easter with jesus and i it's easter with
[53:47] you and jesus
[53:48] it's easter with you i and jesus we are
[53:50] all or jesus you and i
[53:52] we are all resurrected together amen
[53:56] that's my easter
[53:58] not a tradition not a tradition with a
[54:01] certain flowers and
[54:02] a new dress on sunday and
[54:06] that's not easter amen
[54:10] god broke that friends no new dresses
[54:14] no no new dresses no no new this no knew
[54:18] that
[54:19] but a real easter a real resurrection
[54:22] with jesus christ
[54:24] where he brings me up from death
[54:27] brother remember says in the invisible
[54:29] unit of the bride of christ how did you
[54:31] come to this
[54:31] you were deceived into it by your first
[54:33] marriage to your adulterous parent eve
[54:36] it's no fault of your own by your
[54:38] natural birth you come after eve who
[54:39] committed adultery
[54:41] that's the reason you was born an
[54:42] adulteress
[54:44] you're a sinner to begin with that's
[54:46] right you was deceived into it
[54:48] no it ain't your fault
[54:51] you never did it because that little
[54:53] germ that was in you was to be
[54:55] you before the foundation of the world
[54:59] god put your name in the lamb's book of
[55:01] life i don't want this to
[55:03] i want this to drill home i just want to
[55:05] teach on this for a minute and maybe
[55:06] take my time
[55:08] but that little germ that was in you was
[55:11] to be you
[55:12] before the foundation of the world if we
[55:15] had come
[55:16] the right way we would have never been
[55:18] born like we were born with the nature
[55:20] that we were born with
[55:22] that was a sin nature could come from
[55:24] unbelief in god's word and we came with
[55:26] a nature of
[55:27] unbelief amen and that nature amen
[55:30] we conducted ourselves in a certain way
[55:32] by that nature but down
[55:34] under that in the soul is a germ of life
[55:37] that's there too
[55:39] it's there also but it's laying there
[55:42] dormant waiting for something to bring
[55:44] it to life but this outer hall
[55:47] in the soul of this wrong birth has got
[55:49] to die and
[55:50] rot amen so that the life that's already
[55:52] there can come to life
[55:55] that germ that was in you that germ of
[55:57] eternal life amen that's
[55:59] that seed gene that gene of god all the
[56:01] things all the terms brother branham
[56:02] used
[56:03] and he really nails this down in the
[56:05] last year of his ministry and especially
[56:06] in the last few months of his ministry
[56:08] he really starts emphasizing this so
[56:11] that the believer will know
[56:12] how firmly they are planted in christ
[56:17] but if you had come the right way
[56:20] you would have been born without the
[56:22] overshrouding of unbelief
[56:25] without the sin nature without the wrong
[56:27] nature
[56:28] you would have been born only with the
[56:30] nature that was the sea gene of god
[56:32] and you would have been born what a
[56:34] manifested seed of christ
[56:37] you would have been christ manifest in
[56:39] your form
[56:41] and there would have been no struggling
[56:42] with sin there would have been no
[56:45] falling away there would have been no
[56:48] lust of the flesh there would have been
[56:49] none of that you would have come the
[56:50] right way
[56:53] but we came the wrong way and he says
[56:55] there's no fault of your own
[56:58] but even though it's no photo of your
[56:59] own you've got to die to it
[57:04] and the message communion the last
[57:06] message brother branham preached
[57:08] like i said he brings this out down the
[57:10] very end of his ministry
[57:12] if you follow him all the way through
[57:14] and you catch what he's trying to teach
[57:16] us at the end of his ministry
[57:17] it absolutely will thrill your soul it
[57:20] puts such a foundation under your feet
[57:22] that you'll be unshakable no matter what
[57:24] happens everything's fine
[57:26] no matter what happens around me
[57:27] everything's okay because god
[57:29] through his prophet has told me i came
[57:31] from god and i go to god
[57:33] and that peace that's in me was always
[57:34] eternal life and i can no more be lost
[57:36] and god can be alive
[57:37] and that germ of life was to be me from
[57:39] the original a son of god a chip off the
[57:42] old block a peace of god
[57:43] broke forth do we understand that
[57:46] that's why when we talk about the
[57:48] baptism of the holy ghost
[57:49] amen it's really the baptism of the holy
[57:52] ghost is a part of god's
[57:54] life coming to quick and a part of god's
[57:56] life
[57:57] do we understand that a part of god's
[58:00] life
[58:01] coming to quicken a part of god's life
[58:03] life coming to life
[58:04] eagle to eagle word to word oh
[58:08] praise be to god
[58:11] communion he says i say this taking for
[58:13] myself like
[58:15] you was going to say william branham
[58:16] well 40 years ago the william branham
[58:18] it isn't the same one tonight if
[58:22] somebody back there would say william
[58:23] branham he was a rank rascal see
[58:25] because i was born of charles and ella
[58:27] branham in their nature
[58:28] i was a sinner i come to the world a
[58:31] liar and all the habits of the world
[58:32] laid right in me
[58:34] this is good friends this is personal he
[58:38] said
[58:38] i beg this person about me but he made
[58:39] it personal about me too
[58:41] i see myself
[58:44] in their nature i was a sinner i came to
[58:46] the world a liar and all the habits of
[58:47] the world laid right in me
[58:49] but down in there too was another nature
[58:53] present
[58:54] see predestinated was in there by god
[58:58] in this same body see two natures in
[59:00] there
[59:02] down in here there was two i come with
[59:05] the wrong nature from my wrong birth but
[59:07] down in there was a germ of god another
[59:09] nature just waiting to be expressed
[59:11] waiting to be quickened to life by the
[59:14] baptism of the holy ghost in the same
[59:18] body see two natures in there
[59:20] well i only catered to one as i growed
[59:23] i grew as a baby dad first thing you
[59:26] know i became a liar
[59:27] became everything else that a sinner
[59:28] because i raised up that way
[59:30] but down in there was a little speck of
[59:32] life all the time
[59:35] what was it there was another william
[59:38] branham see
[59:40] oh praise be to god there was another
[59:44] william branham
[59:45] the correct one the one that should have
[59:47] come the correct way
[59:48] but now there was one that came a
[59:50] perverted way so it was a pervert
[59:52] i'd say this way it was a perverted life
[59:54] of william branham it had to die
[59:56] so that the true william branham down on
[59:58] the inside could come to manifestation
[1:00:00] that part that was to be you from the
[1:00:02] beginning
[1:00:04] there was another william branham see a
[1:00:06] little spot of eternal life down there
[1:00:08] from the genes of god the word of god
[1:00:10] that was placed in there
[1:00:13] now then one day as i walked on that
[1:00:15] voice talked don't never smoke drink so
[1:00:17] forth
[1:00:18] and the young fellows and all got older
[1:00:20] and there was something moving
[1:00:22] but yet all at once i looked up and said
[1:00:24] i'm not the son of charles and ella
[1:00:26] branham
[1:00:26] there's something calling like my little
[1:00:28] eagle i'm not a chicken there's
[1:00:30] something up yonder somewhere
[1:00:31] oh great jehovah whoever you are open up
[1:00:34] i want to come home there's something in
[1:00:36] me calling
[1:00:38] then i was born again that little life
[1:00:41] was laying there the life of the water
[1:00:42] was poured upon it
[1:00:44] then it began to grow now that old life
[1:00:46] was forgiven
[1:00:47] but in the sea of god's forgetfulness to
[1:00:49] never be remembered against me no more
[1:00:51] see
[1:00:52] now we stand justified as though we
[1:00:54] never had sinned in the presence of god
[1:00:58] why because god knew what portion was to
[1:01:00] be you
[1:01:02] he knows he knows what seeds were there
[1:01:05] in genesis 1 2. when the spirit of god
[1:01:08] moved he knew what was going to come
[1:01:10] forth
[1:01:11] he knew where the life was he knows
[1:01:13] what's to be you
[1:01:14] amen in that part you come of no fault
[1:01:16] of your own
[1:01:18] but that part has got to die the
[1:01:20] unbelief has got to die
[1:01:22] the nature has got to rot away from us
[1:01:25] because you're gonna have
[1:01:26] two natures in one body amen the one
[1:01:28] gene of god was there all the whole time
[1:01:31] friends it's always been there
[1:01:32] amen the gene does it come to you the
[1:01:34] gene's already been there
[1:01:36] amen the counterpart comes to quicken it
[1:01:40] to life
[1:01:43] brother remember says the god who is
[1:01:45] rich in mercy
[1:01:46] i'm only saying this not to mix up
[1:01:48] doctrine but to straighten it out
[1:01:50] he's going to straighten out doctrine
[1:01:52] and let him straighten it out
[1:01:54] that we might get away from this fear
[1:01:56] and scare
[1:01:58] oh praise be to god
[1:02:02] you don't know who you are you're not
[1:02:05] going to be
[1:02:06] but now you are the sons of god see you
[1:02:08] always were the sons of god
[1:02:12] for when god had you in his thinking at
[1:02:13] the beginning you have to be some part
[1:02:15] of you your life that's in you now
[1:02:17] had to be with god before the well when
[1:02:20] he before he even became material here
[1:02:22] on earth before there was anything
[1:02:24] but god you were one of his attributes
[1:02:26] he knowed what your name would be
[1:02:28] he knowed the color hair you would have
[1:02:30] he knowed all about you
[1:02:32] the only thing happened is when you're
[1:02:33] being a sinner many of you can
[1:02:35] fellowship with me on this thought
[1:02:37] when you was a little boy or a little
[1:02:38] girl you would walk around and there
[1:02:40] would be certain things that would just
[1:02:42] where it wouldn't bother the other kids
[1:02:44] it seemed like there was something in
[1:02:45] you that cried out
[1:02:47] there was god somewhere yet you were a
[1:02:49] sinner you remember that
[1:02:52] certainly now what was that that was
[1:02:54] that little form of life
[1:02:56] in you then
[1:02:59] amen all along through life little
[1:03:01] checks little
[1:03:02] little uncomfortable feelings little
[1:03:05] stop stopping along the way
[1:03:06] and sometimes we would sear our
[1:03:08] conscience with a hot iron and learn to
[1:03:10] push past that thing but it was still
[1:03:11] there
[1:03:12] we just had to train ourselves to push
[1:03:14] past that we had to
[1:03:16] we had to move on and commit the sins
[1:03:18] that we wanted to commit but it was
[1:03:19] there
[1:03:21] it was always there amen that little
[1:03:23] form of life in you then
[1:03:25] and then after a while you heard the
[1:03:26] gospel maybe you went to church you
[1:03:28] picked out this and that
[1:03:29] and went from denomination to
[1:03:30] denomination but one day
[1:03:33] you being part of god you had to be part
[1:03:35] of the word
[1:03:37] and when you heard the word you know
[1:03:39] where you come from
[1:03:40] you know that was the truth you were
[1:03:42] always the seed was
[1:03:44] in you always the word seen the word
[1:03:46] that was in you
[1:03:47] hallelujah the word seen the word that
[1:03:50] was in you
[1:03:52] who came who come hunting who the
[1:03:55] chicken in the yard didn't go hunting
[1:03:56] anything
[1:03:57] amen it was the other it was the mama
[1:03:59] eagle that came
[1:04:00] hunting the the baby eagle it was the
[1:04:03] holy ghost that came to brood over the
[1:04:04] seed
[1:04:05] it was god that came after you
[1:04:10] the seed was in you always the word seen
[1:04:12] the word that was in you
[1:04:14] that was before the foundation of the
[1:04:15] world saw the word and you came to it
[1:04:19] why male and female have got to come
[1:04:22] together
[1:04:22] male word female word have got to come
[1:04:24] together and spring forth life
[1:04:28] hallelujah friends
[1:04:32] brother bam says i read these two quotes
[1:04:34] last time but i'd like to read them
[1:04:35] again
[1:04:36] just for context in the rapture
[1:04:39] december 65 he says then now do we get
[1:04:42] into this body first corinthians 12 by
[1:04:43] one spirit we're all baptized into this
[1:04:45] body by one holy spirit baptism
[1:04:48] that if you want to put that down in
[1:04:49] first corinthians 12 13 and by one
[1:04:51] spirit we are all baptized
[1:04:53] and the spirit is the life of christ is
[1:04:55] that right
[1:04:56] the life of christ and the life of any
[1:04:58] seed which he was the word seed brings
[1:05:01] the seed to life you get it
[1:05:03] if that life is laying in the seed and
[1:05:06] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:05:08] comes upon it it's bound to bring that
[1:05:10] seed life
[1:05:12] so the life has already got to be there
[1:05:15] and that life comes on it
[1:05:17] because they're the same seed their
[1:05:20] same nature same life from the same
[1:05:24] source when thou holy ghost which is
[1:05:26] christ
[1:05:28] the anointing comes upon the word that's
[1:05:31] laying in your heart
[1:05:32] it becomes the anointed
[1:05:35] it becomes a messiah why because to be
[1:05:38] christ it has to be the anointed word
[1:05:40] so christ comes back the anointing and
[1:05:43] what's he coming to anoint
[1:05:44] he's not coming to anoint your flesh
[1:05:46] amen he's not
[1:05:47] coming to an anoint an atmosphere he's
[1:05:49] coming to anoint the life that's in the
[1:05:52] seed
[1:05:52] he's coming to anoint the word that is
[1:05:54] down in your soul
[1:05:55] and that becomes the anointed word
[1:05:59] and when the whole baptism holy spirit
[1:06:01] comes upon it it's bound to bring that
[1:06:03] seed life
[1:06:06] then two days later he's preaching
[1:06:08] modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:06:10] he just said that in rapture two days
[1:06:12] later he makes this statement
[1:06:14] notice we find today that there's many
[1:06:16] people just can't believe even
[1:06:17] spirit-filled people
[1:06:19] i'm going to give you one that'll choke
[1:06:21] you the baptism of the holy ghost don't
[1:06:23] mean you're going in not at all
[1:06:24] not on that don't have anything to do
[1:06:27] with your soul
[1:06:28] the baptism see here's the the inside
[1:06:31] soul in here that has to come from god
[1:06:34] but then on the outside you have five
[1:06:36] senses
[1:06:37] to contact your earthly home the inside
[1:06:39] you have spirit and then there you have
[1:06:40] five outlets
[1:06:41] your conscience and love and so forth
[1:06:43] five outlets that spirit remember
[1:06:45] in that spirit you can be baptized with
[1:06:47] the genuine spirit of god and still be
[1:06:49] lost
[1:06:50] it's the soul that lives that was
[1:06:52] ordained of god
[1:06:55] so when the genesis 1 2
[1:06:59] when that holy ghost began to brood over
[1:07:01] and bring the light
[1:07:03] and the light began to shine brother
[1:07:05] brahma says there was seeds there that
[1:07:07] wasn't dermatized to life they were
[1:07:08] burnt out by the water
[1:07:11] but those seeds that had life in them
[1:07:13] were the ones that came
[1:07:14] so the sun hit everything
[1:07:18] the light hit everything
[1:07:20] [Music]
[1:07:21] but only that part that already had life
[1:07:23] in it sprung to life
[1:07:24] and after it sprung into life the life
[1:07:26] inside produced
[1:07:28] the life on the outside
[1:07:31] the light was still there the holy ghost
[1:07:33] was still brooding to bring it into
[1:07:35] greater maturity
[1:07:36] and greater maturity and greater
[1:07:37] maturity but you realize
[1:07:39] that the maturity came by the genetics
[1:07:42] that was in the seed
[1:07:43] and the fruit came by the genetics that
[1:07:45] they're in the seed the works came by
[1:07:47] the genetics that were in the seed
[1:07:49] amen it wasn't it wasn't as though amen
[1:07:53] that the light could put genetics in the
[1:07:55] seed
[1:07:56] the light was there to draw everything
[1:07:58] that was in the seed
[1:07:59] out amen then this word is here the full
[1:08:03] power of the word bringing the fullness
[1:08:05] of the holy ghost is here
[1:08:06] to bring the full life that's already
[1:08:09] written in your
[1:08:10] genes and the genetic code the attribute
[1:08:13] of god it's in you
[1:08:14] to bring it to life we're not asking god
[1:08:16] to give us gifts
[1:08:17] we're not asking god to give us works
[1:08:19] we're not asking god to give us fruit
[1:08:21] manifestation
[1:08:22] it's already in the genes we're just
[1:08:26] laying in the presence of the sun
[1:08:28] so that that sun can draw all that life
[1:08:30] out of us
[1:08:31] into a manifestation we're staying in
[1:08:34] the word
[1:08:34] we're laboring in prayer we're staying
[1:08:36] under the anointed preaching of the word
[1:08:38] we're staying in the message
[1:08:39] so that all the potentials in the seed
[1:08:41] can come out
[1:08:43] when that holy ghost was brooding it
[1:08:45] wasn't putting anything in
[1:08:47] it was bringing it out and the holy
[1:08:49] ghost brooding today
[1:08:51] amen is not putting anything in it's
[1:08:53] bringing it out what's already in
[1:08:57] amen i think sometimes we pray the wrong
[1:08:59] prayer
[1:09:00] lord i i want something more i want
[1:09:02] something different and that's not a
[1:09:04] wrong prayer
[1:09:04] i mean in our heart god understands what
[1:09:06] we're praying for we want greater
[1:09:08] manifestation
[1:09:09] but really what we want is we want the
[1:09:10] freedom to be what we always were
[1:09:13] we want to come to our full potential
[1:09:15] amen and in order to come to full
[1:09:17] potential
[1:09:17] we've got to let the great husbandmen do
[1:09:20] a little pruning on the vine
[1:09:21] we've got to let him cut some things off
[1:09:23] and shave some things down
[1:09:25] and get out of us what shouldn't be
[1:09:26] there we've got to keep
[1:09:28] dying friends so that whatever
[1:09:32] life he wants is the life that keeps
[1:09:34] coming forth
[1:09:36] the holy ghost the baptism only goes
[1:09:38] confined brother man said genuine
[1:09:40] baptism holy ghost
[1:09:41] in your spirit realm and it doesn't have
[1:09:43] anything to do with the soul
[1:09:44] because no matter how many times it
[1:09:46] falls on a soul with no germ of life
[1:09:47] inside
[1:09:48] nothing will happen and an individual
[1:09:51] that has a genuine baptism of the holy
[1:09:54] ghost with the genuine spirit of god
[1:09:56] on their spirit they can have every
[1:09:58] manifestation
[1:09:59] anybody else can have they can have any
[1:10:02] manifestation of a gift
[1:10:03] i'm speaking in tongues and
[1:10:05] interpretation of tongues and dreams and
[1:10:06] prophecy
[1:10:07] amen run the aisles scream and shout and
[1:10:10] dance have any manifestation but if
[1:10:12] there's no germ of life in there
[1:10:14] it was nothing but an excitement during
[1:10:16] a service or at home or wherever it was
[1:10:18] but didn't produce any life
[1:10:22] but there's those who the baptist and
[1:10:24] the holy ghost will come down upon them
[1:10:26] and there's already a germ of life and
[1:10:28] if the baptism holy ghost
[1:10:29] moves beyond flesh beyond spirit but
[1:10:32] strikes that seed that that soul and
[1:10:34] that germ that's in that soul is
[1:10:36] awakened and quickened the life
[1:10:37] then all of a sudden the life that's in
[1:10:39] there begins to come out
[1:10:44] praise be to god that's why
[1:10:48] so many times we feel like we need a
[1:10:52] another baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:10:55] another baptism holy ghost
[1:10:57] in another
[1:11:02] and there's nothing wrong with baptisms
[1:11:04] of the holy ghost
[1:11:06] not a thing wrong with them but it only
[1:11:09] takes one to quicken the seed to life
[1:11:14] what we need after we quicken the life
[1:11:16] is the brooding of the holy ghost
[1:11:19] the light and the water and the brooding
[1:11:23] to bring out what's already there
[1:11:32] brother branham isn't the message spoken
[1:11:34] word is the original seed
[1:11:36] it says and when he seen the bible was
[1:11:38] manifested again like the early days of
[1:11:40] christ see
[1:11:41] because you are a predestinated seed
[1:11:43] just like christ was
[1:11:46] i'll take that
[1:11:49] you are a predestinated seed just like
[1:11:50] christ was
[1:11:52] and when the rain falls on the seed the
[1:11:54] life produces
[1:11:56] itself
[1:11:59] when the rain falls on the seed the life
[1:12:02] produces
[1:12:03] itself where is the life in the seed
[1:12:07] it takes the same kind of life to
[1:12:09] connect with that kind of life
[1:12:10] to quicken it the life to bring the life
[1:12:12] that's already in the seat out
[1:12:15] the life produces itself when the holy
[1:12:16] spirit falls
[1:12:19] when it fell on those seeds jesus said
[1:12:22] he chose them
[1:12:23] before the foundation of the world when
[1:12:24] they were predestinated seed is that
[1:12:26] right
[1:12:27] then here they hauled themselves up in
[1:12:30] the upper room
[1:12:30] these seeds the word what were those
[1:12:33] seeds of the word what were they
[1:12:35] they were the word predestinated for
[1:12:38] that day
[1:12:40] and it wasn't peter's flesh it wasn't
[1:12:42] peter's
[1:12:43] first natural birth but there was a word
[1:12:45] inside of peter's soul
[1:12:48] there was a gene of god laying in
[1:12:49] peter's soul and john's soul and mary
[1:12:51] so it was laying there amen and they
[1:12:53] drug it up
[1:12:54] he says they drug it up to the upper
[1:12:56] room and what was laying there the seed
[1:12:57] the word and the word was laying on
[1:13:00] there with without life in it
[1:13:02] and all of a sudden there came a sound
[1:13:03] from heaven as the waters began to gush
[1:13:05] down
[1:13:06] and it actually filled all the house
[1:13:07] where they were setting and the seeds
[1:13:09] began to grow
[1:13:10] it began to manifest itself the word of
[1:13:12] god being manifested
[1:13:15] amen it changed them peter was a changed
[1:13:18] man
[1:13:20] they had run away when jesus was was
[1:13:23] being
[1:13:23] crucified they had run away when jesus
[1:13:25] was being uh
[1:13:27] uh when he was being bound when he was
[1:13:28] being arrested and tried they had run
[1:13:30] away peter denied the lord
[1:13:32] amen but all the time peter was denying
[1:13:34] the lord he had a seed gene of god on
[1:13:36] the inside
[1:13:37] amen when the disciples scattered and
[1:13:39] went running away afraid they had a seed
[1:13:41] gene of god on the inside
[1:13:42] amen but peter had the audacity to go
[1:13:45] out and weep bitterly over his sin and
[1:13:47] over his mistake and
[1:13:48] and gone would be given jesus christ
[1:13:50] would reveal himself as a resurrected
[1:13:52] savior to them
[1:13:53] but there had to be something that
[1:13:54] quickened that seed to life
[1:13:56] amen and when christ went up amen he
[1:13:58] sent the holy ghost down on the day of
[1:14:00] pentecost
[1:14:00] and when that when that holy ghost fire
[1:14:03] struck
[1:14:04] amen that seed is sparked to life and
[1:14:06] what was laying there come to life
[1:14:08] and he ran out amen under that anointing
[1:14:11] and
[1:14:11] all the life that was in there began to
[1:14:13] take the word and place the word for his
[1:14:15] day
[1:14:17] he come out preaching amen he was in
[1:14:19] there hiding he came out preaching
[1:14:21] and then he was in there running he came
[1:14:22] out preaching he was in there a failure
[1:14:24] he came out successful
[1:14:27] and he began to preach amen and in acts
[1:14:30] chapter 2
[1:14:31] let's just turn to acts chapter 2 and
[1:14:32] look at this
[1:14:35] acts chapter 2 verse 1
[1:14:38] now remember peter loved jesus
[1:14:43] john james uh philip
[1:14:47] all of them loved jesus they loved his
[1:14:50] ministry
[1:14:51] and they had something in them that
[1:14:52] attracted them to the ministry
[1:14:55] we got that when others left there was
[1:14:58] something in them that held them to that
[1:14:59] ministry
[1:15:02] they loved it they recognized it they
[1:15:03] knew it was the word they
[1:15:05] they didn't recognize everything they
[1:15:06] couldn't piece it all together but they
[1:15:07] knew it was right and then they they
[1:15:09] believed he was the son of god amen they
[1:15:11] could
[1:15:11] even catch some revelation of who he was
[1:15:14] and
[1:15:15] and and they loved him amen but they
[1:15:18] needed something more
[1:15:20] there was something in them that was
[1:15:22] attracting them to christ
[1:15:24] but they needed something more they
[1:15:26] needed that seed to be quickened to life
[1:15:30] acts chapter 2 and when the day of
[1:15:33] pentecost was fully come
[1:15:34] they were all with one accord in one
[1:15:36] place and suddenly there came a sound
[1:15:38] from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and
[1:15:40] filled all the house where they were
[1:15:41] sitting
[1:15:42] and there appeared unto them cloven
[1:15:44] tongues like as a fire and it sat upon
[1:15:46] each of them
[1:15:47] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:15:48] ghost and began to speak with other
[1:15:49] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:15:51] utterance
[1:15:53] but the story is not over there turn to
[1:15:56] verse 14.
[1:15:58] they began to spill out and speaking in
[1:16:01] tongues and
[1:16:02] all the men that were gathered from all
[1:16:03] the nations there for the feast of
[1:16:04] pentecost they begin to hear
[1:16:06] they begin to hear them glorifying and
[1:16:08] praising god in their own language
[1:16:10] it was a sign that was gathering the
[1:16:12] people but verse 14
[1:16:14] they questioned these men are drunk and
[1:16:17] peter stands up in verse 14
[1:16:18] and he says but peter standing up with
[1:16:20] the eleven lifted up his voice and said
[1:16:22] unto them
[1:16:23] you men of judea and all ye that dwell
[1:16:24] in jerusalem be this known unto you and
[1:16:26] hearken to my words for these are not
[1:16:28] drunken as you suppose seeing it is but
[1:16:30] the third hour of the day
[1:16:32] but this is that which was spoken by the
[1:16:34] prophet joel and it shall come to pass
[1:16:37] in the in the last days saith god i will
[1:16:39] pour out my spirit upon flesh
[1:16:41] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:16:43] prophesy and your young men shall see
[1:16:45] visions and your old men shall dream
[1:16:46] dreams
[1:16:47] and in my servants and all my handmaids
[1:16:49] i will pour out in those days in my
[1:16:50] spirit
[1:16:51] and they shall prophesy and i will show
[1:16:53] wonders in the heaven above and signs in
[1:16:55] the earth beneath blood and fire and
[1:16:56] vapor and smoke
[1:16:58] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[1:17:00] and the moon and the blood before that
[1:17:02] great notable day of the lord come and
[1:17:04] it shall come to pass that whosoever
[1:17:05] shall call on the name of the lord shall
[1:17:07] be saved
[1:17:09] peter
[1:17:12] peter now changed
[1:17:17] something quickened the life in him and
[1:17:19] peter didn't come forth now
[1:17:21] and they came forth with a mighty sign a
[1:17:23] wonder that was gathering attention to
[1:17:25] people and they made a wrong accusation
[1:17:27] they're drunk
[1:17:28] and he stood up and he and he didn't
[1:17:30] start debating whether they were drunk
[1:17:31] or not
[1:17:33] and he didn't start proving with a
[1:17:34] toxicity test
[1:17:36] he didn't he didn't go back and and try
[1:17:39] to show him you know
[1:17:40] you know in our former religion no what
[1:17:42] peter could do
[1:17:43] then after the seed was quickened inside
[1:17:45] of him peter could now
[1:17:46] take the word and place it for his day
[1:17:49] he could take what was happening and say
[1:17:51] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:17:54] it's not what you think amen but now
[1:17:56] amen something in him there was
[1:17:58] something in peter that could take that
[1:18:01] word and find the application for his
[1:18:03] day
[1:18:03] he was laying in the seat when peter was
[1:18:05] running away it was laying there
[1:18:08] when peter was hiding out it was laying
[1:18:09] there when he was cursing amen it was
[1:18:11] laying there when he was weeping
[1:18:13] bitterly because of his sin
[1:18:14] it was still laying there but when it
[1:18:16] was quick in the life there was
[1:18:18] something in him
[1:18:19] that was attracted amen to the
[1:18:20] manifestation for his hour
[1:18:23] and it never drove peter back amen to go
[1:18:26] back to the old system he came out of
[1:18:28] but it pushed peter and the disciples
[1:18:30] forward into the new territory
[1:18:32] of the new land that god had opened up
[1:18:35] they were sitting stagnant between two
[1:18:37] dispensations
[1:18:39] they had they had known christ had come
[1:18:42] i mean they had believed it was the son
[1:18:43] of god
[1:18:44] they had seen him after his resurrection
[1:18:45] they were firmly convinced but they
[1:18:47] didn't know what to do
[1:18:50] they were gathering together in upper
[1:18:52] room they were in prayer for 10 days
[1:18:54] they didn't know what move to make but
[1:18:57] the
[1:18:57] move the spirit come over them and when
[1:19:00] the spirit moved upon peter
[1:19:01] and it quickened that seed to life now
[1:19:04] they knew what to do according to the
[1:19:06] word and they knew where they were at
[1:19:07] they knew what day it was and they knew
[1:19:09] what word was being fulfilled
[1:19:13] see the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:15] doesn't take us back to a previous
[1:19:17] dispensation
[1:19:19] the baptism holy ghost doesn't move us
[1:19:21] back but pentecostal denominational
[1:19:23] teaching
[1:19:24] but the baptism holy ghost moves us
[1:19:26] forward amen into the new land that's
[1:19:28] been opened up for us
[1:19:31] until that happens we can be stuck
[1:19:33] between two dispensations
[1:19:36] we can realize that that malachi 4 has
[1:19:39] come we can realize that god sent the
[1:19:41] prophet we can realize that he come and
[1:19:42] open the seals
[1:19:43] we can realize all of those things have
[1:19:45] happened amen the seals are open
[1:19:47] the prophet has come amen
[1:19:51] this is a new day we can realize all of
[1:19:53] that amen but we're just stuck between
[1:19:55] two dispensations
[1:19:56] and what is it going to take to get us
[1:19:58] to move into the new day
[1:19:59] it's going to take the baptism of the
[1:20:01] holy ghost to quicken the seed that's
[1:20:02] inside
[1:20:03] because the seed that's inside you is a
[1:20:05] seed that was predestinated to move into
[1:20:08] the land
[1:20:09] and take all the land which is the word
[1:20:12] that's been restored to us
[1:20:14] no longer sitting between two opinions
[1:20:16] no longer sitting between two
[1:20:17] dispensations
[1:20:18] but now running full head long fully
[1:20:21] embracing
[1:20:22] this is the day this is the day this is
[1:20:25] to be fulfilled
[1:20:28] peter and the disciples never looked
[1:20:30] back they moved forward
[1:20:33] in satan's eden brother bam says i heard
[1:20:36] brother neville say
[1:20:37] this morning someone might have been
[1:20:39] asking him why
[1:20:41] why didn't i preach on the holy ghost
[1:20:43] why didn't i do this
[1:20:44] here it is hallelujah
[1:20:49] here it is the holy ghost is the action
[1:20:52] in you
[1:20:53] it's a life not an emotion
[1:20:57] not some sort of fleshly evidence but it
[1:20:59] is a person
[1:21:00] jesus christ the word of god established
[1:21:03] in your heart
[1:21:03] to quicken every word of this age
[1:21:07] watch the holy ghost in action not so
[1:21:09] much demonstration
[1:21:11] but in action what it does according to
[1:21:14] the word
[1:21:16] that's what happened in the upper room
[1:21:18] what was it the holy ghost not so much
[1:21:19] in demonstration
[1:21:20] there was a demonstration amen but what
[1:21:23] was the action the action was
[1:21:25] this day this word this is what joel
[1:21:28] said
[1:21:28] this is the prophecy fulfilled this is
[1:21:30] where we're moving to
[1:21:34] it's the action in you
[1:21:38] and the god of this evil age brother
[1:21:42] says the outside man is a physical being
[1:21:45] which is controlled by six senses or
[1:21:46] five senses rather
[1:21:48] the inside man is a spirit man which is
[1:21:49] controlled by five senses conscience and
[1:21:51] love and so forth
[1:21:52] the outside man see tastes fill feel
[1:21:54] smell and hear
[1:21:55] but the inside of that spirit is a soul
[1:21:58] and it's controlled by one thing
[1:22:00] your free will you can accept what the
[1:22:02] devil says or accept what god says
[1:22:04] and that'll determine what spirit is in
[1:22:07] there
[1:22:09] that'll determine what spirit is in
[1:22:10] there spirit and where in the soul
[1:22:13] what spirit is in the soul what is
[1:22:15] spirit life what is life the life of the
[1:22:17] seed
[1:22:18] that's been quickened to life amen and
[1:22:20] now living there's a spirit
[1:22:21] down in the soul and it's the spirit of
[1:22:23] god
[1:22:26] it'll determine what spirit is in there
[1:22:29] if it's the spirit of god it'll feed on
[1:22:31] the things of god and it won't
[1:22:32] feed on anything of the world
[1:22:36] jesus said if you love the world or the
[1:22:39] things of the world it's because the
[1:22:40] love of god has not
[1:22:41] even entered this inner part
[1:22:46] let's look at romans 8 together
[1:22:52] romans 8 verse 8.
[1:23:04] romans 8 8 so then they that are in the
[1:23:08] flesh
[1:23:08] cannot please god hallelujah
[1:23:14] how much of our actions are just fleshy
[1:23:18] and determined by fleshly desire
[1:23:21] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[1:23:23] god but ye are not in the flesh but in
[1:23:25] the spirit of so be that the spirit of
[1:23:27] god dwell in you
[1:23:29] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:23:30] christ he is none of his
[1:23:33] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[1:23:35] because of sin
[1:23:36] but the spirit is life because of
[1:23:38] righteousness
[1:23:40] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:23:43] jesus from the dead dwelling you he that
[1:23:45] raised up christ from the dead shall
[1:23:47] also quicken
[1:23:48] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:23:50] dwelleth in you
[1:23:52] praise be to god this is quickening time
[1:23:56] this body that was used to fulfill the
[1:23:58] lust of the flesh
[1:24:00] amen there's a seed on the inside that's
[1:24:02] got to be quick in the life
[1:24:04] and when we die out to everything it's
[1:24:06] quick in the life
[1:24:07] and now that quickening power brings
[1:24:09] this body that was used to manifest
[1:24:12] unbelief will now manifest faith
[1:24:16] this is the tabernacle that's used to
[1:24:18] display the life on the inside
[1:24:20] and when that when that nature all
[1:24:21] nature dies and that
[1:24:23] original nature comes to life that was
[1:24:25] that intended to be you from the
[1:24:26] beginning
[1:24:27] comes alive it'll show up it'll quicken
[1:24:29] this mortal body
[1:24:30] that same spirit dwell in you
[1:24:34] brother man says in the message you must
[1:24:35] be born again
[1:24:37] did you know that you got an old crow
[1:24:40] no matter how much you try you could
[1:24:42] paint him just as olive color as a dove
[1:24:44] just as gray as a dove white
[1:24:46] paint him all over he's still a crow
[1:24:48] inside
[1:24:50] he's still stinky and old buzzer you're
[1:24:52] just the same scavenger eat the dead
[1:24:54] things of the earth that's right
[1:24:55] but you know what a dove don't even have
[1:24:57] to take a bath
[1:24:59] oh hallelujah a dove's body because he's
[1:25:01] a dove
[1:25:02] he's got an oil that comes through his
[1:25:04] feathers that just keeps him clean all
[1:25:06] the time because it comes from the
[1:25:07] inside
[1:25:08] out oh why the buzzard says mine too
[1:25:11] i put a little holy water on them
[1:25:13] brother it fixes it no
[1:25:14] it didn't for it comes from the inside
[1:25:17] out
[1:25:18] not from the outside in it's a burst
[1:25:26] in hebrews chapter 6 out of 1957 on the
[1:25:28] hebrew series he says and a man that's
[1:25:30] born of the spirit of god becomes
[1:25:32] a dove of god his nature his
[1:25:35] change his makeup yes sir you put the
[1:25:37] spirit of the dove in the crow
[1:25:39] he'd never set on a dead carcass
[1:25:45] thinking man's filter in 1965 he says
[1:25:47] and the dove
[1:25:48] never has to take a bath a dove's body
[1:25:51] puts out oil from the inside that keeps
[1:25:53] it clean
[1:25:54] it's a life that's in the dove it
[1:25:57] generates in a oil that keeps the
[1:25:59] feathers clean and so is a christian
[1:26:02] there's a life within that keeps them
[1:26:06] clean
[1:26:08] see i want to wrap up by talking about
[1:26:10] the dove and the crow
[1:26:12] brother graham says the dove and the
[1:26:14] crow were both in the ark
[1:26:16] they were both in church they were both
[1:26:18] in noah's message
[1:26:22] two birds and they're both birds they're
[1:26:25] relatively similar in size crow's a
[1:26:27] little larger
[1:26:28] and the crow and the dove were both
[1:26:30] birds
[1:26:31] they were both in the ark they had both
[1:26:34] gathered in
[1:26:34] under the message of that day but they
[1:26:37] had two different natures
[1:26:40] and noah would release a dove but
[1:26:43] because a dove was a clean living bird
[1:26:45] can only eat the pure grain the pure
[1:26:47] word of god
[1:26:48] that dove when there was no place to
[1:26:50] land found its way back
[1:26:52] but the crow because the crow can eat
[1:26:54] either it can either eat grain
[1:26:56] or it can eat dead carrion when that
[1:26:58] crow was released it never came back
[1:27:00] but the band said it was having a
[1:27:02] jubilee hopping from one dead body
[1:27:04] floating on the water to another dead
[1:27:05] body
[1:27:06] just eating the dead things like the
[1:27:08] dead denominational stuff left over from
[1:27:10] a previous dispensation
[1:27:14] and in so many times i'm afraid
[1:27:17] that that are all around us
[1:27:20] we have crows that think they're doves
[1:27:24] crows because they can eat the grain and
[1:27:28] like it
[1:27:31] they can eat the grain and like it
[1:27:33] they're in the ark and they like the ark
[1:27:35] they like the atmosphere and they are
[1:27:37] the ark's just fine they don't have a
[1:27:39] problem with the ark
[1:27:41] don't have a problem with noah and then
[1:27:44] when he's feeding grain
[1:27:45] the dove and the crow they eat side by
[1:27:47] side and the dove says all this is good
[1:27:49] grain
[1:27:50] and the crow says oh this is good grain
[1:27:54] they both enjoy the grain they enjoy the
[1:27:56] feast
[1:27:57] they come to church they enjoy the
[1:27:59] preaching they get excited about it but
[1:28:01] they go back
[1:28:02] but when they go back and in their
[1:28:04] private life and on their cell phone and
[1:28:05] when they're in the room and when
[1:28:07] nobody's watching
[1:28:08] amen the dove won't eat dead carrying
[1:28:11] but the crow who just enjoyed the grain
[1:28:13] can enjoy the movie can enjoy the video
[1:28:16] can enjoy the images
[1:28:18] can enjoy the video games can enjoy all
[1:28:20] the worldly entertainment
[1:28:22] and come right back to church and enjoy
[1:28:25] the grain again
[1:28:26] and then go right back out and enjoy the
[1:28:28] dead things of the world and come right
[1:28:30] back in
[1:28:30] and is deceived thinking because i'm in
[1:28:33] the ark and because i like grain
[1:28:35] then i'm a dove no friends if you like
[1:28:38] amen
[1:28:38] if you like the entertainment world just
[1:28:40] as much as you like church and you enjoy
[1:28:42] the movies as much as you like church
[1:28:44] amen there's a problem
[1:28:47] if you like the dead things of the world
[1:28:48] and worldly entertainment lust of the
[1:28:50] flesh and lust of the eye
[1:28:51] if you can enjoy eating that as much as
[1:28:54] you enjoy the word
[1:28:55] amen there needs to be a death amen
[1:28:57] there needs to be a new birth
[1:28:59] something's got to change
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:03] amen being in the ark is good but that's
[1:29:05] not it
[1:29:07] eating the grain is good but that's not
[1:29:09] it enjoying it all is good but that's
[1:29:11] not it
[1:29:11] remember there's got to be a nature
[1:29:13] change from the inside
[1:29:15] amen noah couldn't change amen that crow
[1:29:19] to a dove and spending time with the
[1:29:21] dove couldn't make the crow a dove
[1:29:25] brother branham said when you're born
[1:29:27] again your nature's changed you become a
[1:29:29] dove
[1:29:30] and in the dove there's a oil
[1:29:34] on the inside that comes from where
[1:29:37] becomes from the sea gene of god down in
[1:29:39] the soul that's quick in the life
[1:29:41] that oils from the inside out amen it's
[1:29:44] not coming to church
[1:29:45] to get a clean fix
[1:29:48] it's not letting the preaching of the
[1:29:50] word amen come forth and just scour me
[1:29:52] clean
[1:29:54] man that's what we have to come to
[1:29:56] before our nature's changed
[1:29:59] we have to come and and let the
[1:30:01] preaching just rake everything away from
[1:30:03] me
[1:30:03] and cut it all away amen and expose me
[1:30:07] oh praise god let it expose the fact
[1:30:09] that i need a nature change
[1:30:12] let it expose the fact that i'm still
[1:30:14] enjoying
[1:30:15] worldly things and i know that i need
[1:30:18] something to change inside
[1:30:20] of me i'm still spending
[1:30:23] hours and hours wasting my time and
[1:30:26] wasting my mind
[1:30:27] on video games shooting people i'm
[1:30:30] wasting my time on netflix i'm wasting
[1:30:32] my time on youtube
[1:30:33] i'm wasting my time playing with things
[1:30:35] of the world
[1:30:36] there needs to be a nature change
[1:30:39] there needs to be something where i say
[1:30:41] i don't no longer have an appetite for
[1:30:42] those things
[1:30:43] i don't enjoy it anymore something in me
[1:30:45] has changed it doesn't taste
[1:30:47] good to me anymore not an abstinence
[1:30:50] but a nature change amen
[1:30:54] not living in a commune not not a not an
[1:30:57] entertainment fast
[1:30:58] but a nature change where that life on
[1:31:02] the inside
[1:31:03] that god is always meant to be you from
[1:31:05] before the foundation of the world comes
[1:31:07] alive
[1:31:07] and you can honestly from your heart say
[1:31:09] i don't want it anymore
[1:31:12] i don't enjoy it like i used to enjoy i
[1:31:15] don't want to eat it even though i used
[1:31:16] to like that i don't like it anymore
[1:31:18] something in me is different now
[1:31:23] not coming to church and saying make me
[1:31:26] feel good
[1:31:30] dove doesn't need to go to church to
[1:31:32] feel good
[1:31:35] the dove doesn't need to go to church to
[1:31:36] get cleaned
[1:31:42] all around the world message churches
[1:31:45] are shut down
[1:31:46] everybody i talk to everybody i've
[1:31:49] talked to is completely shut down
[1:31:52] can't even can't even gather like we're
[1:31:54] gathered today
[1:31:56] everybody i talk to is completely shut
[1:31:59] down
[1:32:01] but it never stopped a dove once it
[1:32:04] never slowed them down
[1:32:06] and never stumbled them
[1:32:10] because a dove has something on the
[1:32:11] inside
[1:32:13] that cleans them from the inside an ah
[1:32:15] an oil
[1:32:16] a holy ghost that comes a life that
[1:32:19] comes from the seed
[1:32:20] that's been quickened the life and oils
[1:32:22] them from the inside out and keeps them
[1:32:24] clean
[1:32:24] and keeps them fresh amen the the dove
[1:32:27] is not hindered in their walk
[1:32:29] because the dove has a nature where what
[1:32:32] it needs to keep it clean
[1:32:34] is on the inside of it
[1:32:37] because messes churches are shut down
[1:32:42] and and people are off work
[1:32:46] they're at home
[1:32:49] my question is what have we done with
[1:32:51] that time
[1:32:53] what what are we eating on
[1:32:57] what are we eating on with all kinds of
[1:32:59] time
[1:33:00] home from work and
[1:33:03] and verizon gave everybody 15 extra gigs
[1:33:08] what a perfect test what a perfect test
[1:33:11] for god to show us
[1:33:12] what nature we have what a perfect
[1:33:15] opportunity for us to say you know what
[1:33:18] i'm not where i'm supposed to be
[1:33:22] amen god in his mercy
[1:33:25] if we were drawing strength from one
[1:33:27] another deliver righteous life
[1:33:28] god's going to smash that so we find out
[1:33:30] what we really are
[1:33:33] if we were just living a certain way
[1:33:35] because of being around the believers
[1:33:36] and we were getting encouragement from
[1:33:38] them to live a certain way
[1:33:39] and they were keeping us straight and
[1:33:41] all the hours of fellowship and all the
[1:33:43] good preaching was keeping me lined up
[1:33:45] amen god can smash all of that and make
[1:33:47] it go away tomorrow
[1:33:48] so that he can show you where you're
[1:33:49] really at
[1:33:53] and you can say lord i'm not satisfied
[1:33:56] with what i've seen
[1:33:57] amen i had no appetite for your word i
[1:34:01] had no appetite for the message i had no
[1:34:03] appetite for streaming but i sure had an
[1:34:05] appetite for netflix
[1:34:08] i sure had an appetite for nonsense and
[1:34:11] goofiness and foolish videos and all of
[1:34:14] this passed around
[1:34:15] and hours on social media all kinds of
[1:34:18] time that i've absolutely
[1:34:20] killed in foolishness but my appetite
[1:34:22] for your word never went up
[1:34:25] i say god help us god help us
[1:34:29] say lord we need you i need
[1:34:32] something to come from the inside out
[1:34:34] amen something that's not dependent on a
[1:34:36] brother or sister
[1:34:37] something not if all my fellowship is
[1:34:39] cut off for a year and i'm put in
[1:34:41] solitary confinement
[1:34:42] and i'm not handed a bible i want
[1:34:44] something to come from the inside
[1:34:46] out to keep me clean i want there to be
[1:34:48] a life that's been quickened by the
[1:34:50] spirit of god and i want it to be him
[1:34:52] living inside of me not that it's not a
[1:34:55] struggle not that we're not tempted
[1:34:56] and we can be tempted we can struggle we
[1:34:58] can fight but there's got to be
[1:35:00] something on the inside
[1:35:01] not coming from the outside but
[1:35:03] something on the inside's got to be
[1:35:05] coming out
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:08] if the holy ghost is doing anything for
[1:35:10] us in the preaching of the word
[1:35:11] though what the holy ghost is doing for
[1:35:12] the sea gene of god is bringing what's
[1:35:15] there
[1:35:15] to the surface and drawing it up it's
[1:35:17] not putting more
[1:35:18] in it is bringing it out
[1:35:22] there's got to be a quickening there's
[1:35:24] got to be a nature change
[1:35:26] the crow has got to die amen if we find
[1:35:30] out that there's a still
[1:35:31] a crow nature that i'm living by that i
[1:35:33] can equally
[1:35:35] feed on worldliness and filth and i can
[1:35:37] feed on that just the same as i can feed
[1:35:39] on the word
[1:35:40] it's time to get on our face and say god
[1:35:41] i want to die so
[1:35:43] thoroughly god i want to die because i
[1:35:45] want nothing but a dove nature to be
[1:35:47] expressed in me
[1:35:49] i want a real resurrection amen i don't
[1:35:52] want to be around people of a
[1:35:53] resurrection
[1:35:54] i don't want to talk about brother
[1:35:55] branham's resurrection talk about mom
[1:35:57] and dad's resurrection
[1:35:59] but i want to have my own resurrection
[1:36:02] let this be my resurrection sunday oh
[1:36:05] god
[1:36:06] let this be the time that i realized
[1:36:08] something in me
[1:36:09] something in me died something was
[1:36:11] smashed something was broke
[1:36:13] and something else quickened the life
[1:36:16] amen if it's there it's always been
[1:36:20] there
[1:36:21] it's been the thing that causes us to
[1:36:23] love the word it's been the thing that
[1:36:24] causes us to hang around for years
[1:36:26] it's been the thing that causes us to
[1:36:28] recognize is true amen but it can't just
[1:36:30] be laying there in a dormant state
[1:36:32] like it was in peter recognizing it's
[1:36:34] true but it's got to go through the
[1:36:36] fiery baptism to light it off
[1:36:38] to where that life becomes a life that
[1:36:40] begins to flow
[1:36:41] that is not outside influence
[1:36:43] influencing me
[1:36:44] amen we're done with outside influences
[1:36:47] influencing me
[1:36:48] no more is that if i can just get around
[1:36:50] the right atmosphere if i can just get
[1:36:51] around
[1:36:52] the right people i'll do right god's
[1:36:53] going to break that so you don't have
[1:36:55] that to lean on
[1:36:56] [Applause]
[1:36:58] when i'm with so-and-so i do good when
[1:36:59] i'm so so i do bad amen
[1:37:01] that doesn't affect the dove
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:08] a dove will cut that off say i love you
[1:37:13] but what's inside of me doesn't match
[1:37:15] and i can't go that way
[1:37:18] if i could just have different friends
[1:37:21] i've heard people say before
[1:37:24] you know my kid's a good kid if he just
[1:37:27] was under a better influence
[1:37:30] better influence might keep him from
[1:37:32] doing certain things
[1:37:34] but what they really need is a new birth
[1:37:37] not just a better influence
[1:37:39] a better influence can can change the
[1:37:41] atmosphere a new birth can take place
[1:37:43] absolutely but they need more than a
[1:37:45] better influence
[1:37:48] anymore they need a new birth we need
[1:37:51] that seed
[1:37:52] that was always meant to be you
[1:37:55] it's got to come to life it's got to be
[1:37:58] quickened off
[1:38:01] the crow nature has got to die
[1:38:07] until that dead thing
[1:38:12] doesn't even attract my attention
[1:38:16] and you you think about those who've
[1:38:18] been born again
[1:38:19] you think back to days and you see
[1:38:22] something you hear an old song or
[1:38:26] somebody talks about an old movie
[1:38:27] something you did years ago watched
[1:38:29] years ago experienced years ago
[1:38:31] you pass an old place an old nightclub
[1:38:34] an old bar or something you used to go
[1:38:36] to
[1:38:38] and you realize there's nothing in me
[1:38:41] that wants that anymore i was so pulled
[1:38:46] i used to be so driven to do wrong
[1:38:49] there was something in me it was almost
[1:38:51] like would take control of me
[1:38:53] and move me to the wrong so attracted to
[1:38:56] watch this and
[1:38:57] i had such a hard time turning my head
[1:38:59] when there was a woman who wasn't
[1:39:00] dressed right around
[1:39:01] i was so pulled the wrong way but now
[1:39:04] you go past and you realize
[1:39:06] something's changed my appetite is
[1:39:09] different
[1:39:11] i don't even want that anymore in fact
[1:39:14] i'm repulsed by the very fact i used to
[1:39:16] be attracted to it
[1:39:18] and i and you get to the place where you
[1:39:21] can't even imagine what it was like
[1:39:25] to the place where i i can't even
[1:39:27] imagine why i even liked that
[1:39:31] what happened the crow died
[1:39:35] because then used two natures one from
[1:39:37] your natural birth to come forth the
[1:39:39] center
[1:39:39] but down in there there was the real
[1:39:41] william branham
[1:39:43] there was the real tre chad lam there
[1:39:45] was the original life that came from the
[1:39:47] father the attribute that was to be you
[1:39:49] and then and it was laying there covered
[1:39:51] over with darkness with this wrong
[1:39:52] nature amen and down in your soul
[1:39:55] amen it had to die it had to die you had
[1:39:58] to
[1:39:58] hate it you had to despise it it
[1:40:00] couldn't be that you know
[1:40:02] i still really want to do this so i'm
[1:40:04] not ready to give my heart to the lord
[1:40:05] yet that's not it yet friends
[1:40:08] it's got to be till you loathe the
[1:40:10] creature that you are
[1:40:13] many of us have gone through that
[1:40:14] experience where we want to serve god
[1:40:17] and all of a sudden all you do is mess
[1:40:18] up and mess up and mess up
[1:40:20] and you keep falling in the same thing
[1:40:22] and falling in the same thing amen
[1:40:24] and god is getting you to the place
[1:40:25] where you absolutely
[1:40:27] hate the creature that you are you
[1:40:29] despise it and you despise its lust
[1:40:32] and you so wish it would die how many of
[1:40:35] you went through that experience
[1:40:37] wanting to serve god but in your flesh
[1:40:39] there's no capacity
[1:40:40] and you find that you fall flat on the
[1:40:42] very thing you said you would never do
[1:40:44] again and seemingly you were powerless
[1:40:46] to overcome it and then you hated
[1:40:48] yourself for it and you hated what you
[1:40:50] were
[1:40:52] oh hallelujah that's the place we need
[1:40:54] to get to if you haven't come to that
[1:40:55] yet
[1:40:56] amen say god help me to hate this flesh
[1:40:59] help me to hate my natural birth help me
[1:41:01] to hate what came from my parents helped
[1:41:03] me to hate what came from the fall
[1:41:06] we can't still kind of like it friends
[1:41:08] it's got to be an absolute
[1:41:09] abhorring it i hate it and i don't want
[1:41:12] nothing to do with it
[1:41:13] and out of the ashes of that death out
[1:41:16] of that burning down of the old life
[1:41:17] there's something else laying there
[1:41:19] waiting to come forth but it won't
[1:41:23] compete
[1:41:25] there won't be any competition this
[1:41:28] one's got to die
[1:41:30] for this one to live let it be a
[1:41:33] resurrection sunday
[1:41:36] monday tuesday wednesday it doesn't
[1:41:39] matter
[1:41:40] it doesn't have to take place in church
[1:41:42] it doesn't have to take place while
[1:41:43] listening to church
[1:41:44] it doesn't it could take place in your
[1:41:45] car it could take place in your prayer
[1:41:47] closet it could take place on a walk
[1:41:49] it could take place in this building
[1:41:50] tonight it could take place in your home
[1:41:52] where you're sitting it could take place
[1:41:53] just let god
[1:41:54] burn it out and die and reckon yourself
[1:41:57] dead
[1:41:58] and crucify the flesh and say god make
[1:42:00] that live inside of me
[1:42:02] bring your spirit to me and whatever
[1:42:05] amen whatever goes with it i'll
[1:42:07] take whatever sensation whatever
[1:42:09] manifestation i just got to have the
[1:42:11] quickening off
[1:42:12] i got to have the lighting of the candle
[1:42:14] i got to have the spark that ignites
[1:42:16] what's inside of me
[1:42:18] so that it's no longer me it's you
[1:42:20] living your life through me
[1:42:25] there's a life within the dove
[1:42:28] why because it was born a dove
[1:42:32] when you and i are born again there's a
[1:42:34] life inside of us
[1:42:36] by what by birth by what incorruptible
[1:42:40] seed and inside that life
[1:42:44] is the life of god it is god do you
[1:42:47] believe that it's the life of god
[1:42:48] it's the spirit of god and we're oiled
[1:42:52] from the inside out
[1:42:56] i don't need to go to church to get my
[1:42:57] next fix

[1:43:04] me pulls me to church
[1:43:07] i love the word because something inside
[1:43:09] me loves to worry
[1:43:10] i shall i meant because something inside
[1:43:12] me shouts amen
[1:43:15] but there's got to be something from the
[1:43:17] inside coming out
[1:43:20] when things get worse and there is no
[1:43:23] church to
[1:43:24] come to what will keep us then
[1:43:29] if things get bad and we get scattered
[1:43:31] to the winds
[1:43:32] what will keep us then it's got to be
[1:43:36] the thing that's keeping us now
[1:43:39] say god i don't want to be
[1:43:43] i don't want to be a crow amen but i
[1:43:46] want to be a dove

[1:44:31] but it's not me bubbling it's something
[1:44:34] behind me pushing me bubbling up
[1:44:38] you know and jesus when he talked to the
[1:44:40] woman at the well
[1:44:41] he asked her for a drink and
[1:44:45] and she was confused he's talking
[1:44:48] natural
[1:44:48] but she said if he says if you knew who
[1:44:50] i was you'd ask for me a drink
[1:44:53] and this water that i give to you would
[1:44:55] be water life
[1:44:56] springing up a well of water a well of
[1:44:59] water springing up into eternal life
[1:45:01] springing up into eternal life
[1:45:03] springing means leaping or gushing up
[1:45:08] see that woman was already a well
[1:45:14] and within her was already the water
[1:45:19] but it needed to spring up it needed to
[1:45:23] gush out
[1:45:24] he said i am needs to go by samaria why
[1:45:27] there was a well that needed doug
[1:45:31] in the days of abraham he dug wells
[1:45:34] but when abraham died it says the
[1:45:37] philistines
[1:45:38] covered in filled in the wells that
[1:45:40] abraham and doug
[1:45:42] but it said isaac the promised son he
[1:45:44] come by
[1:45:45] and his servants to dig out the wells
[1:45:48] that his father abraham had dug
[1:45:50] why because isaac knew there was a well
[1:45:54] right there
[1:45:56] my father had already put a well right
[1:45:58] there there's water there
[1:45:59] it looks like sand it looks like dirt
[1:46:02] but there's a well there
[1:46:03] and it said isaac's servants they began
[1:46:05] to dig in the valley
[1:46:07] and when they dig they said we found a
[1:46:09] well
[1:46:10] of springing water living water
[1:46:13] jumping when did it become alive it was
[1:46:16] always springing water
[1:46:18] it was just covered over amen and the
[1:46:20] father knows where the wells are
[1:46:22] amen and his son now the great holy
[1:46:25] ghost the son
[1:46:26] of god is moving here and he's using his
[1:46:28] servants to dig
[1:46:29] out wells so that the water can spring
[1:46:31] out again
[1:46:32] amen we didn't put any water there the
[1:46:35] water was already there
[1:46:37] there just had to be some digging take
[1:46:39] place to let it flow
[1:46:40] and when jesus went to samaria amen
[1:46:42] there was already a well of water there
[1:46:45] he went to a well but he was looking for
[1:46:47] a well
[1:46:48] a well that his father had planted a
[1:46:50] well that his father knew was there
[1:46:52] and all he had to do was do a little
[1:46:53] digging move a little rubble you've had
[1:46:56] you've had six husbands five husbands
[1:46:58] and the one you're with now is not your
[1:46:59] own
[1:46:59] what's he doing he's just uncovering the
[1:47:01] well
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:04] and she began to spring forth and ran
[1:47:06] into the village and told them all
[1:47:11] see friends he wasn't putting no water
[1:47:14] there
[1:47:15] the water was there
[1:47:19] not putting any oil in the dove the
[1:47:21] oil's coming out of the dove
[1:47:25] not putting life in the seed life's
[1:47:27] already in the seed
[1:47:29] but the life has to come and spark it to
[1:47:32] life
[1:47:33] quicken it but the life's already there
[1:47:34] it's a germatized seed
[1:47:37] eternal life is already there so life is
[1:47:40] coming to awaken life
[1:47:42] the seed is coming sea life is coming to
[1:47:44] bring life out of the seed
[1:47:46] it's already there the water is already
[1:47:48] there
[1:47:51] but the philistines have covered it over
[1:47:55] worldly influences and demon powers have
[1:47:57] covered it over
[1:48:00] but maybe let the servants of the
[1:48:03] promised son
[1:48:04] do a little digging and get rid of a
[1:48:07] little dirt of the world
[1:48:10] and say quit being so tied into sports
[1:48:13] and worldly entertainment let's throw
[1:48:14] that off
[1:48:15] quit being so tied into the fashions of
[1:48:17] the world
[1:48:18] drop all this noiseless chatter on our
[1:48:21] social media
[1:48:22] stop all the nonsense of foolishness
[1:48:24] that's being passed around
[1:48:25] let's just dig a little bit and see if
[1:48:27] there's some water there
[1:48:30] let the servants of of isaac dig around
[1:48:32] a little bit
[1:48:33] and say guess what i found
[1:48:36] springing water gushing out living fresh
[1:48:40] and flowing all the time you know when
[1:48:43] the rubble was taken off
[1:48:45] and it was dug out isaac didn't have to
[1:48:47] do anything to start it
[1:48:49] he didn't have to do anything to get it
[1:48:50] flowing all they had to do was move the
[1:48:52] world out of the way
[1:48:53] and when the world was moved out of the
[1:48:55] way it sprang up and
[1:48:57] kept springing friends because there was
[1:48:59] a power down behind
[1:49:00] it way down deep that was pushing it out
[1:49:03] why do you bubble
[1:49:04] is it because i come to you no why you
[1:49:06] vote because the d is no
[1:49:07] because there's something behind me
[1:49:09] pushing me why are you springing up
[1:49:11] why are you joyful in the midst of a
[1:49:13] trial why are you happy when the world
[1:49:15] is
[1:49:15] scared and in chaos why are you so
[1:49:17] joyful because there's something behind
[1:49:19] me pushing me up
[1:49:21] why when you're sitting at home with an
[1:49:23] extra 15 gigs you're not watching movies
[1:49:27] why because there's something in me
[1:49:28] there's an oil coming from the inside
[1:49:30] out
[1:49:31] it's not outside in i've missed
[1:49:33] fellowship i've been separated from my
[1:49:35] brothers amen i can't even go to work
[1:49:39] but there's still something from the
[1:49:40] inside coming out
[1:49:45] praise be to god friends
[1:49:48] we want our resurrection we gotta die
[1:49:53] we gotta die and let the servants
[1:49:56] dig out the well get all the dirt out of
[1:49:59] the way
[1:50:01] and die if you say
[1:50:04] i realize today i still have the nature
[1:50:07] of a crow
[1:50:09] that i still have an appetite for dead
[1:50:11] stuff
[1:50:13] now is the time to say lord let me die
[1:50:16] i want to die let me die lord
[1:50:20] take it out of me god i don't want an
[1:50:23] appetite for anything of the world
[1:50:25] i don't want an appetite for worldly
[1:50:27] things for worldly entertainment for
[1:50:29] lust i don't want i don't want an
[1:50:30] appetite for that
[1:50:32] but i want an appetite for only your
[1:50:34] good grain
[1:50:35] where i feed daily on your grain and i'm
[1:50:38] so hungry for more grain that i can't
[1:50:40] wait to get back
[1:50:43] it's time to die so that this could be
[1:50:45] your resurrection
[1:50:47] let's pray lord jesus we thank you
[1:50:51] father for the goodness you've given to
[1:50:53] us
[1:50:54] we thank you for your good word lord and
[1:50:56] the instructions you give us out of your
[1:50:58] word

[1:51:05] comes from
[1:51:07] how it acts god i pray that all
[1:51:10] denominational thinking would be smashed

[1:51:20] manifestation let it all be smashed

[1:51:32] have a birth
[1:51:34] that that seed that you've planted
[1:51:35] inside of us so long ago
[1:51:37] has to be quickened to life and that
[1:51:40] life has to take over
[1:51:42] god there's many no doubt that are

[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:38] consume me
[1:54:40] lord and make
[1:54:45] me more like
[1:54:52] break me
[1:54:54] lord and
[1:54:57] bless the broken pieces
[1:55:02] of my
[1:55:14] [Music]
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:29] by the fire of
[1:55:33] your spirits
[1:55:43] and make me more
[1:55:47] likely to
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:55:59] the break faces
[1:56:02] of my life
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:18] one more time
[1:56:29] [Music]
[1:56:40] me
[1:56:43] and make me more
[1:56:58] [Music]
[1:56:59] broken pieces
[1:57:02] of my life
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:21] praise the i'll lord you a question
[1:57:26] what church did abraham go to
[1:57:29] to get strength for his journey
[1:57:32] who did abraham lean on in times of
[1:57:36] trouble
[1:57:38] what church did noah go to to get
[1:57:40] instructions
[1:57:41] on how to do what god had asked him to
[1:57:43] do
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:45] what church did isaac go to after
[1:57:47] abraham died
[1:57:48] to find out how to live in the land
[1:57:52] see abraham had to separate from
[1:57:54] everything else
[1:57:56] because he found out all the things that
[1:57:57] he was leaning on and was leaning on him
[1:57:59] was holding him back
[1:58:00] he had to get alone with god
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:05] see we don't need
[1:58:08] a new church a new camp
[1:58:11] another experience we just need to come
[1:58:14] to life
[1:58:17] we just need the seat on the inside to
[1:58:18] be sprung to life
[1:58:20] we just need him we just need to meet
[1:58:22] the mate
[1:58:24] the male and the female just need to
[1:58:26] come together
[1:58:27] to quicken the seed on the inside and
[1:58:29] now life is growing on the inside
[1:58:31] there needs to be an impregnation
[1:58:36] you know we're coming back to the time
[1:58:39] we come to church we love to come to
[1:58:40] church we should come to church
[1:58:42] that's not the problem it's not what i
[1:58:43] mean but look through the bible
[1:58:47] who did they have they had god
[1:58:51] who kept abraham strong god
[1:58:55] who kept isaac strong god who kept jacob
[1:58:58] strong
[1:58:59] god who did they have god it was a
[1:59:02] personal relationship with the personal
[1:59:04] god
[1:59:05] they were the seed of god responding to
[1:59:08] the move of god
[1:59:11] you see friends at this time if
[1:59:14] we get separated from one another can't
[1:59:17] have church like we should
[1:59:18] or even if they shut streaming down if
[1:59:21] somehow
[1:59:22] the internet collapses tomorrow and
[1:59:25] every infrastructure falls apart
[1:59:28] will you lose your experience will you
[1:59:31] have a hard time overcoming
[1:59:33] temptation or trial will you fall away
[1:59:36] because there's nobody to keep me strong
[1:59:39] see if that's the place we're in we need
[1:59:41] a we need an experience with god
[1:59:44] and maybe some of these things are
[1:59:45] coming our way to give us an opportunity
[1:59:48] and if i have unraveled your
[1:59:49] christianity today then i'm not
[1:59:51] apologizing
[1:59:53] if i've made you feel uncertain and
[1:59:55] unsecure and unsure
[1:59:56] unsure i'm not apologizing for that
[1:59:59] because your security can't come from
[2:00:01] anything else than your connection with
[2:00:02] christ himself
[2:00:04] you have got to know you've met the
[2:00:06] bridegroom you have got to know you've
[2:00:08] went into the inner chamber
[2:00:09] you have to know you've had the
[2:00:11] experience with your mate
[2:00:12] and it's quick and something in life
[2:00:14] without that there's no sure foundation
[2:00:16] there's no solid rock to stand on
[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:20] and if i have upset your apple cart i'm
[2:00:23] not going to apologize
[2:00:26] because it needed upsets we've got to
[2:00:29] get to they have the experience that
[2:00:31] says
[2:00:31] i know who i am and i know who i belong
[2:00:35] to
[2:00:35] i know who my king and my god are my
[2:00:38] saviors and i know him
[2:00:40] and he knows me and i know how to
[2:00:42] contact him when i need to contact him
[2:00:44] and i know how to hear from him when
[2:00:45] he's ready to speak to me
[2:00:49] that's the thing that matters most
[2:00:51] that's the foundation i would go back
[2:00:53] and check friends
[2:00:54] if there's anything we're checking right
[2:00:56] now check that foundation
[2:00:59] i know who my maker is i know who my
[2:01:01] redeemer is i've met him personally
[2:01:05] i know he hears me and i know that i
[2:01:08] have the capacity to hear from him
[2:01:11] when he chooses to speak i can hear
[2:01:14] when he decides to move me i can move
[2:01:18] this isn't the hour for pretend
[2:01:20] christians
[2:01:22] this isn't the site we're not moving
[2:01:24] into the cycle where we play church and
[2:01:26] come to church and house is full and the
[2:01:28] worship is great and i feel good
[2:01:30] and as long as all that's going i can
[2:01:32] live an overcoming life we're past
[2:01:34] that those days are done god's going to
[2:01:35] smash that
[2:01:38] we've got to be the kind of believer if
[2:01:39] i get cut out of the herd and separated
[2:01:41] and i'm all by myself wandering in the
[2:01:43] wilderness just me and my family
[2:01:44] we'll still be believers we'll still
[2:01:47] serve god we'll still believe this
[2:01:49] message
[2:01:49] will still stand in holiness and
[2:01:51] righteousness because it's not me
[2:01:53] it's not a life i'm living it's a life
[2:01:55] he's come in and is living through me
[2:01:57] whatever life was in that seat when it
[2:01:59] sprung to life it's taken over friends
[2:02:02] and nothing's going to stop that life
[2:02:04] breaking my fellowship i'll still have
[2:02:06] that life
[2:02:08] break break the church i still have that
[2:02:10] life
[2:02:11] lose my job i'll still have that life
[2:02:14] the government completely breaks down
[2:02:16] i'll still have that life
[2:02:19] it may not be easy there may be
[2:02:21] struggles
[2:02:22] but that's the part we have that's the
[2:02:24] place we have to be in this hour
[2:02:28] let's die if we're not there yet die
[2:02:32] throw yourself fresh on the altar
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:35] a stone that was cut out of the mountain
[2:02:36] without hands
[2:02:38] [Music]
[2:02:40] everything that it falls on is grounding
[2:02:41] the power and blowed like the chaff of
[2:02:43] the wind
[2:02:44] but everything that falls on it is
[2:02:46] broken to pieces
[2:02:49] why don't you just if you've not done so
[2:02:51] yet why don't you just throw yourself
[2:02:52] down on that stone
[2:02:54] and say lord break me to bits just
[2:02:57] shatter me lord and let that life in me
[2:03:01] reform me according to that life that's
[2:03:03] on the inside
[2:03:06] i want to i want to be just as true as
[2:03:08] abraham was
[2:03:09] [Music]
[2:03:11] when david was chased away and lived in
[2:03:13] a cave he was still true to you i want
[2:03:15] to be true to you
[2:03:17] when the apostle paul was separated and
[2:03:19] put in prison his testimony diminished
[2:03:22] not one drop
[2:03:23] that's the life i want on that all alone
[2:03:26] and in isolation with nobody looking i
[2:03:29] still want to be pure
[2:03:32] i still want to be pure when
[2:03:36] i'm all by myself and there's not a soul
[2:03:39] watching me
[2:03:40] and not one person will ever know what
[2:03:42] i'm going to do next
[2:03:43] i still want oil to come from the inside
[2:03:46] out and keep me clean
[2:03:49] remember brother biscuit's testimony
[2:03:51] when he talks about chris
[2:03:52] that little norwegian or swedish man
[2:03:54] that brother branham loved so much
[2:03:57] they were hunting on a hunting trip and
[2:03:59] he was laying sleeping and
[2:04:00] and brother branham was looking at him
[2:04:02] and brother biscuit walked in the tent
[2:04:04] and he saw him staring at him asleep
[2:04:08] he said brother brethren looked and
[2:04:09] looked at by the biscuit he put his hand
[2:04:11] up and he said put him in a room
[2:04:13] with a thousand women and it'll come out
[2:04:16] pure
[2:04:18] i say god that's what i want i want that
[2:04:21] with all of my heart
[2:04:23] that you live your life in this flesh
[2:04:26] that it's you not me my my natural
[2:04:29] life's got to die it's incapable
[2:04:31] but that life on the inside is capable
[2:04:33] of living holy and true
[2:04:36] that's what we want lord when the first
[2:04:39] church was broken and scattered
[2:04:41] and sit naked and poor i mean with
[2:04:44] nothing
[2:04:45] scattered out they were still believers
[2:04:50] i'm sure some of them maybe had doubts
[2:04:52] and fell away and went back but
[2:04:54] there was real genuine believers and no
[2:04:57] matter what happened they kept moving
[2:04:59] forward
[2:05:01] why they had been quickened the life
[2:05:05] i think it's safe to say we have no clue
