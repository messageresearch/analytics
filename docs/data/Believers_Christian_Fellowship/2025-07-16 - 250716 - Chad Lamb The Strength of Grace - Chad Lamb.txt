If you're struggling in confusion, wondering why your heart seems low, take your hands off this old world and let it go. Let it go. Let it be. It's not reality, but a shadow of a shadow of a shadow.

Walk like sons and daughters of your father living here below. For you're not of this old world. to let it go. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. The angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what would I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. They're all expecting me. And that's one thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus many years ago. I know he'll see me through. Oh, I am weak and poor and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Just over in glory land we'll live eternally. The saints on every hand are shouting victory. The songs of sweetest praise drift back from heaven short. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. [Music] Remember [Music] 1 Thessalonians 5:23. [Music] Raise your voices in one accord. It is the coming of the Lord. We sound a trumpet in the streets. It's time for all to come and see. Raise your hands in one accord. Bring down the presence of our Lord. Our God is our consuming fire. He's changing hearts and men's desires. Oh, in the days of Jesus when he walked upon the earth, he declared a gospel that had never before been heard. He said, "My peace I give it unto thee, not as the world gives, but my peace I give it unto thee and be a fountain. of living waters in a dry and thirsty land. And your cup will run over enough to share. Enough to share with your fellow man. So if you're dry and weary, can't find the light of day. We come onto these waters, the truth, the life, the way. Come to this fountain. Jesus will show you the way. Well, come onto these waters. You can find your way. So let your heart not be troubled. Let your mind be at ease. You have found the living waters as you rest at Jesus feet. There is a course to follow. [Music] There is a ground to prove. We're all headed for a change in our lives. Let your heart remain unmoved. We are following the author, the finisher of the faith. He has called his chosen people and he knows your every name. your every name. If we call upon the author, the finisher of the faith. We'll see his works among us. We'll know he's still the same. There's just no name like Jesus. There's just no other name to call. Well, there's just no name like Jesus. May his dove rest on us all. Let your heart not be troubled. Let your mind be at ease. And oh precious Lord, strip me of vain glory and pride. Please take away all that's left of self. Oh, Lord, have evidence make me I pray.

As brother Chad comes this evening, let's go to the key of D. Quiet me. Let peaceful waterers flow. Learn to be still. Oh my soul, [Music] let me hear. My Jesus, draw me near. [Music] Touch me, Lord, and quiet me. Quiet me. [Music] Quiet [Music] me. Let peaceful waterers flow. Learn to be still. Oh my soul, [Music] let me hear my Jesus strongly. Touch me Lord and quiet. Sing with me one more time. In quiet me, let peaceful waterers flow and learn to be still. Oh my soul, [Music] let me hear my Jesus call me. [Music] You touch me, Lord, and quiet me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Lord Jesus, we thank you, God, for the privilege of being here tonight, Lord, that you would draw us here, Lord, and that you would bring us into that unity, Lord, by worship, one heart, one accord. And God, that's the condition your children were in in the upper room, Lord, when your presence filled the room, when your power filled them. And God, may we be one, one heart, one accord, aligned, Lord, to you, Lord, with our desire to hear from you. And may you come and fill each one of us with your power, Lord. May the light of the gospel, may the illumination of your pillar of fire light each soul, Lord, quicken us to life, Lord, and guide our lives. God, we want to quiet ourselves, Lord. This world is so busy and our minds get so busy and life is so fast. Lord, we we're thankful for a time in the middle of the week, Lord, to draw aside that to quiet ourselves from the race of life and the pace of life and to focus our attention on you, Lord. And God, as we're focused on you, would you come and speak to us words of life? Come and instruct us in life, Lord. Encourage us, build us up, correct us, Lord. everything we have need of for this journey. We're looking to your word to supply it all. May you come now and give us a portion of that word this evening. May it strike our souls. May it come to life within us. And Lord, may that seed go into the good ground of our souls that you've prepared before the foundation of the world. And may it return to you a bountiful harvest. Lord, we love you. We ask that you would take this vessel of mind under your control. May you preach the gospel according to the way that you've designated in this end time through vessels of clay. Lord, I surrender to you. We surrender to that. May you come and speak your words and drop them into our hearts. We pray. May you have your way with us. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. It's good to be here this evening. If you'd like to take your Bibles while we're still standing together and turn to the book of Deuteronomy. We'll go to the book of Deuteronomy. Thank you, musicians. While you're finding Deuteronomy, I just want to remind you that we have a fellowship dinner coming up this Sunday after service over in the fellowship hall and out in the pavilion. So, we're looking forward to that time together of fellowship. Also want to encourage you and remind you to sign up so we know what you're bringing so the those in the kitchen can make proper preparations. Amen. There was a link sent out. So, if you could do that, that'd be great. Also want to uh let you know that brother uh Gabe Smith will be ministering at Bible Believers this Sunday. So, remember him in prayer as he's preparing the rest of the week and he'll be over there on Sunday. So, we want to remember him through the weekend as well. And also, I want to say happy birthday, Brother Jim. God bless you, Brother Jim. It's good to celebrate your birthday together in church. Amen. It's a good place to be. Amen. I heard that in the back. I thought, praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let's turn to the Deuteronomy chapter 7. Deuteronomy chapter 7. I just love that song, Quiet Me, because life is way too fast &gt;&gt; and this world is way too noisy and Leodysia is relentless in pace and at constantly ti tying up our attention and tying up our time and but I thank God that he's drawn us together to hear from him. I thank God for a Wednesday night service, for a Sunday service, for the fellowships in between, for those special times. And and I see the wisdom of God in setting it up like this where we constantly come back to change pace, to stop what we're doing, to realign because we got to constantly realign. This world is trying to knock us off true north. &gt;&gt; But God keeps bringing us back together, to line us up, to remind us of who we are, to remind us of our purpose. Amen. to give us strength and courage to continue doing what he's called us to do in this end time. So, it's good to be here together. In Deuteronomy chapter 7, I'd like to begin reading from verse 6. Says, "For thou are a holy people unto the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all the people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people. For you were the fewest of all people. But because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Amen. May God bless you as you take your seats and as we look at his word. Uh I love I love this portion of scripture. We've read it many times. But it begins, "Thou art a holy people." And when God begins to speak to them, he doesn't he's not dealing with a a super pious very religious perfect set of people. So when he says you're a holy people, he's not he is not giving a a statement of their religious condition. &gt;&gt; But holy means set apart or sanctified, separated. And God says, "You are a separated people. I separated you to myself." It wasn't what they did. It's what he did that made them holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So you are a holy people. And he's talking to people that have come through a wilderness journey and wanted to go back to Egypt and failed to go to Kadesh Barnea and and and complained in the bitter waters of Myra. They they had every problem and complaint and then they got upset about the mana that was provided and that was loathome to them and then they wanted meat and God fed them meat till it came out their noses and then they complained again and had fiery serpents and and he says, "Thou art a holy people." I don't think he was commending their conduct. I think he was speaking of their condition because of what? Because of his choice and his separating them out. So I tell you today, you're a holy people. &gt;&gt; You're not a holy people because of your conduct. You're not a holy people because of your perfection. You're holy because he chose you out of this world and separated you unto himself. That makes you a holy people. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself. He didn't say, "I chose you because you're a special people." I chose you to be a special people. &gt;&gt; Are we getting it? &gt;&gt; Amen. God didn't choose us because we were special. God didn't choose us because we were better. God didn't choose us because we had our act together. God God's choice makes us a special people because he chose us to be a special people. set aside, separated, drawn to himself, taught by his word, and different than everybody else on the planet. &gt;&gt; Not different in themselves, different in his choice &gt;&gt; and in his teaching. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. And then, I have chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all the people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than the people, for you were the fewest of all people. Now he's getting down to it. I did not choose you because of your merit. &gt;&gt; I chose you not because you're great. You're not great. That's what he's telling him. Not because you were the greatest. You weren't the greatest. You were the least. &gt;&gt; That's what he That's what Moses is telling them. &gt;&gt; But because the Lord loved you. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Because the Lord loved you and he would keep his o his oath. So why has God Amen. Why has God sanctified us? separated us out, called us holy, separated to himself to be a special people. Why has he done that? Because we were great? No. Because we we had it all together? No. Amen. Because he chose before the foundation of the world this. And that's his love. He set his love upon us. Amen. Not because we were great, cuz we weren't. Not because we deserved it, because we didn't. But because he chose it according to his oath, his promise. Amen. the word that he established before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; Amen. It does so good to be reminded of these things. Amen. So many times we we we don't always come to church to hear something new. We come come to church to hear something needful. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't always need something new. We need something needful. We need to be reminded of who we are and why we are what we are. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's a reason that that that we need that because we're human beings living in a world that's giving us wrong messages all the time. And even our own human mind and even our own flesh is giving us wrong messages and wrong signals all the time. We need the word of God to conquer even this vessel that we live in and the world that we live in. And only the word of God, only the truth will overcome the lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're dwelling in the midst of lie &gt;&gt; and a body that's a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz what's a lie? The truth perverted. You were supposed to be in human form, but not fallen human form, not hybrid human form. So this is a lie. I live in a lie. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God has revealed to us the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Frank, if you want to go ahead and bring up the PowerPoint. I want to speak on the strength of grace uh this evening. And the message of grace, Brother Bam preaching 61. He said, "Sovereign grace is from a sovereign one." Sovereign grace from a sovereign one. Sovereign, what can it do? Sovereign can do whatever it wants to. &gt;&gt; A sovereign means the ruling authority. The sovereign is the king. &gt;&gt; So the king is called the sovereign. He's the sovereign of the nation. He's the one who makes the decisions for the whole nation. He's sovereign, &gt;&gt; right? He gets to choose. So the sovereign is the king. So, we have sovereign grace, &gt;&gt; which means the ruling authority that nobody can advise or tell what to do, but gets to make his own choice. He's the one who put grace upon you and chose you by his grace. Amen. It's the king's grace on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it can't fail. There's no higher authority but the sovereign. There's nobody else that can rule. There's nobody that that there's nobody that can redig what he has done. Amen. Because it's sovereign grace. Amen. This is special grace. Sovereign grace can only be given by one that's sovereign. Praise God. &gt;&gt; We use the term sovereign grace so much, but I love when we break it down and think about it. Amen. We've got sovereign grace has been bestowed upon us. Amen. So, it has to be bestowed by a sovereign one. And God is sovereign. So, he can give sovereign grace. Therefore, being sovereign, grace don't have to ask anybody. It don't it doesn't it does what it wants to. Isn't that wonderful? It don't ha has to ask can I do this or can I do that? Can I? Must I will I doesn't do it. It does it itself. Grace is sovereign. Therefore, he can save the vilest. He can save the worst. He can save the impurst. He can save the immoralist. He can heal the sickest. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good news, friends. Because there's sovereign grace. And nobody can trump sovereign grace. Sovereign's coming from the sovereign. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to ask permission. And it doesn't have to apologize. And it doesn't have to give excuses for why. &gt;&gt; And he can save the worst, the vilest, the impurest, the immoralist. &gt;&gt; Why? By his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to Galatians together. I want to look a little bit at the Apostle Paul because he's such an easy example of this. So, we're going to pull out a few scriptures from the life of Paul. And then keep moving. Galatians chapter 1 verse 13. Galatians 1 and3 says, "For you have heard of my conversion in time past in the Jews religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood. So, here is Paul in in the book of Galatians giving a little bit of his background and he says, "You all know, you've heard my testimony. You've heard the story of my of my conversion, how that uh uh he says um that I persecuted the church of God and wasted it." Here's here's Paul going back and reflecting on the condition he was when God called him. And the condition he was in in when God called him is he was a man who was vi fighting the very truth. He was fighting the very God of heaven. He was calling Antichrist the very Christ. He was saying things that were he was blaspheing. He was saying things were ungodly that were godly. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Paul even said he blasphemed but he did it ignorantly. And so this is he's going back through the condition that he was in. Because when he shows the condition that he was in, then he can show the grace of God that called him to the position he's now in. Because the condition he was in did not merit his position that God called him to. He didn't earn that spot, friends. Amen. when he's out there hauling Christians into prison and having them stoned and killed and consenting to their death, separating families and tormenting and wreaking havoc of the church of God, he did not earn his apost apostilhip by merit. &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, if we went by merit, he deserved death. I mean, he deserved death and retribution. He was killing Christ. Amen. He was killing the body of Christ. He was persecuting Jesus Christ. He was fighting the truth, fighting the word, fighting against God, and killing God's elect seed. &gt;&gt; What did he deserve? A promotion to apostilhip. &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. He deserved anything but that. But God had a predestinated plan for them. God had a choice for him. And it wasn't even what Paul wanted. It wasn't what he deserved, but it was what the sovereign grace had already determined would happen. That's why it has to be by grace. There's no other way that we can make it in this day unless it's sovereign grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we'll look at this in the book of Acts. We've been through it many times. Acts 9. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananas. And to him, said the Lord in a vision, Ananas. And he said, behold, I am here, Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Arise and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus. For behold, he prayth and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananas coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight. Then Ananas answered, Lord, I have heard many of this man, how much evil he hath done to the saints at Jerusalem, and here he hath authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name. But the Lord said unto him, "Go thy way, for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel, for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake." Amen. Poor Ananas &gt;&gt; got the call to go find Saul of Tarsus, and he's trying to stay away from Saul of Tarsus. They all got word that he's coming and he's got letters and and authority from the chief priest and the elders. Amen. And they're all running and hiding. Nobody wants to go meet Saul on his road to Damascus. Amen. Because of the journey that he was on and the purpose of that journey. Amen. And the purpose of that journey was wickedness. The purpose of that journey was evil. The purpose of that journey was harming the work of God. &gt;&gt; But God was going to interrupt him in the middle of his journey to destroy God's elect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because he earned it. Not because he was good. Not because God said, "Wow, he's so zealous. I'm going to give him a &gt;&gt; promotion." &gt;&gt; No way. Ananas, you know, it's amazing. You would you would think I I always think this way. The the word of the Lord comes and God speaks to you. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Are you sure, Lord? Are you sure you got the right Saul of T? This one is the one that's doing all of this. Do you know who you're talking about? And you can't blame Ananas. How can you blame him? How what would you do if it was you? Amen. When you say, "Jump up, click your heels, and say, "Oh, I've been looking forward to this day." You'd be saying, "Lord, are you I I you know, I Yeah, I know you're the sovereign God and all knowing and omnipotent and all of that, but do you know what he's doing?" [Applause] [Laughter] and and he was true. That was honest. That was a true report. That was the reality of Saul. But God knew something else. And God was going to bestow his grace upon this man. &gt;&gt; The only way that he could use Saul was by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it was impossible to use him by merit. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The only way &gt;&gt; that he could that Paul could be an apostle and that Paul could get the mysteries of Christ and Paul could preach the mysteries. The only way was by grace. He could never God could never have used him based on a merit system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why it has to be by grace. And I think Paul went so much in the wrong direction with so much zeal and he had regrets the rest of his life. Brother Bam tells us that that Saul it always bothered Paul about the death of Stephen and and and also the other persecution. And brother Bam said that's why Paul wanted to die a martyr's death because of his guilt and his shame for what he had done. So it bothered him all of his life. But but yet God was going to use this man to preach the message of grace for the first time. &gt;&gt; He was going to use this man to separate law and grace and establish the covenant of grace with the Gentiles and help whenever Israelites could move into grace and establish the covenant of grace with the Gentiles. Amen. Praise God. It was going to have to take a man that understood his position by grace to preach the message of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the only way that Paul could take that position was by the power of sovereign grace. By the strength of grace. It couldn't be in the strength of Saul. &gt;&gt; It had to be in the strength of grace. He says in 1 Corinthians 15, "And last of all, he was seen of me also as one of born out of due time. For I am the least of the apostles that I'm not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all. Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. I think Paul learned I think Paul understood grace. I think he had a good understanding of what grace was because when he refers back to his apostilhip, he's always he's he's often telling the church why he's not worthy to be an apostle and why he shouldn't be an apostle, why he's the least likely to be an apostle. Amen. And so Paul is is always reaffirming his position is by grace, &gt;&gt; not by merit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what about your position? &gt;&gt; How'd you get in your position? because you were a good boy and did everything right and perfectly obedient and always got it right and always did right, always looked right, always dressed right, always acted right, always had the right attitude and always had the right atmosphere around you and and the first time you heard the message, you took it and everything the prophet said, you did it exactly right. So, you were awarded a merit system and you were allowed to come into the bride of Christ and now God loves you because you've done everything right. &gt;&gt; You see, that defeats grace completely. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we can understand this is why this is why this mentality is a human mentality. It's stuck. It's ingrained in our brain to think this way. Amen. Everything around us is based off a merit system. Your your work and your your your promotions and everything that you work for and everything you labor for. You work you labor. You do right. You get good. And there's reward. There's a there's a whole reward system set up for that. And we in our minds think this way. Amen. The problem is when we take this way, this method to our salvation. Amen. The problem with that is is we're in fallen flesh and we can never get it right all the time. So when we base it even subconsciously on a merit system, amen, every time our merit falls below par, we start to struggle with am I a child of God? Am I even saved? Do I have the Holy Ghost? Was I born again? And we start struggling with all of these questions. And why are we asking ourselves the questions? We're asking ourselves the questions because we failed to meet the mark. &gt;&gt; Meaning in our minds is a merit system for our salvation. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; because the very minute we start to think that way, Amen. then we we're back to carnal humanistic thinking. &gt;&gt; And listen, I don't blame you for that. I got the same thing going on between my these two ears of mine. We just have to recognize it and fight against it because God never saved me because I was good. Because God by his sovereign grace can save the vilest, the immoralist, the the most impure. And that's what he did for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if he can save me by grace, can he not keep me by grace? Can he not keep me saved by grace? &gt;&gt; Hey, praise God. It's a it's a simple concept, but it's so hard for the human character to handle. &gt;&gt; It's simple, but it's tough for our human minds to cope with it. &gt;&gt; And so, and those sometimes who do cope with it go the wrong way with it. &gt;&gt; In fact, that it's God's grace. I can do anything I ever want to do and I'm under the grace of God. Well, that just shows you haven't been recipient of true grace yet. Because true grace does not that when you receive grace that way. Amen. It doesn't lead you down that path. &gt;&gt; So let's keep moving in this thought here. And the Queen of Sheba says it just as goes to show a person has to be ordained of God to believe or they'll never believe anyhow. They have nothing to believe with. They just don't have no depth in their soul. Listen, you're not a believer because of merit and intelligence. It's because God ordained you to believe because you have something placed in your soul to believe with &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves. It's the gift of God. &gt;&gt; The faith to believe, to receive his grace is a gift. So there's no way that we can uh the the scripture says that where is boasting? It's excluded. Why is it excluded? Because I never did this of my own. I never worked my way into it or up to it. I never overcame. I never studied enough. There was no way that I crossed a certain finish line to merit this grace. Amen. This was something that God freely bestowed upon me. And even the ability to believe in his grace didn't come from me. It came from him that's in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he placed that seed in you before the foundation of the world. He placed it in your soul. Amen. That's what that's the part of you that's believing. It's not your brain. That's why your brain can question. That's why your brain can doubt. That's why your brain can waver. Amen. The wavering of the brain has absolutely nothing to do with your salvation. &gt;&gt; The battle in the mind. And brother Bam said God can plant he said that Satan can plant thoughts in your mind. He cannot read your mind, but he can plant thoughts in your mind. If he can plant thoughts in your mind, then you probably shouldn't trust all the thoughts in your mind. &gt;&gt; Pretty pretty this pretty simple logic. I thank God for a prophet who could break it down so easy for us. We probably shouldn't trust all the thoughts going through our mind. &gt;&gt; So your mind can doubt, your mind can question, your mind can become troubled. Amen. Your mind your mind can do the calculation. I've been this bad this many times this week. Therefore, I'm probably not a son or daughter of God. Your mind can come up with that formula. Amen. That's okay. The mind's the mind. Amen. But there's got to be something deeper than the mind that could connect to this word and say, "But I'm not worthy to be a son of God. I've done all of those things and I'm ashamed of them and I'm not worthy to be called a son or daughter of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am." &gt;&gt; Not because I was a good boy this week or a bad boy this week. I am this because God chose me before the foundation of the world. He set his love upon me. &gt;&gt; Why? Listen, I can't intellectually tell you why. All I can do is believe. Something in me says, I believe he set his love upon me &gt;&gt; and I'm a recipient of his grace. &gt;&gt; So, this is why it can only be by the strength of grace. It can never be by human strength. That will always fail. Uh Jesus says, ' But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him. And he said, "Therefore I said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the Jesus never hated Jud Judas because he was an unbeliever. Amen. &gt;&gt; You never see the disciples riing against Judas because he was an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Because Judas couldn't be a believer if he wasn't a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's why you see, you know, you see in the Bible that that when you find out that we are what we are by the grace of God, it doesn't allow me to despise anybody else. in any condition they're in. I can't despise them. I can I can be hurt for them. I can not like the activity, the conduct, the things that are We can despise immoral conduct. &gt;&gt; We can despise things that are gross or perverted or harmful or dangerous or evil or wicked. You can despise all that, but I can never despise a person for being an unbeliever. And I can never despise somebody for not knowing the truth. And I can never despise somebody for not having any overcoming power. Because if it was not for the grace of God, I would have no overcoming power. I would have no ability to believe. I don't believe of my own merit. I believe of the seed gene of God that he's put in my soul. &gt;&gt; And so that's why for for us, amen, we can just take people as they are. Amen. And not not hate them for what they are. Hate maybe despise what they do, but I can never despise this human being. Amen. Because where would I be without the grace of God? Where would Saul of Tarsus be if God had not found him on the road to Damascus and and changed the whole course of his life? Where would any Where would the fisherman be if Jesus hadn't stepped on the shore and say, "Hey, drop your net and come follow me." Amen. If God didn't find and Jesus says, "You didn't you didn't choose me. I chose you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where would we be if he didn't choose us? &gt;&gt; Amen. So these great mighty men, Peter, he became all that Peter was. Amen. But Peter knew that Peter didn't do anything Peter did by Peter's own strength. He knew that Peter did it by the grace of God because in his own strength, he denied the Lord three times to save his skin. &gt;&gt; They all failed. So it it takes God. In Matthew 13, he says, "And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive. For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest at any time they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and shall understand with their heart, and should be converted. You got that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you see with your eyes, &gt;&gt; hear with your ears, and understand with your heart, you get converted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are you converted? Because you see, you hear, and you understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how you get converted. &gt;&gt; So, how do I see and hear and understand? &gt;&gt; He says, "And I should heal them, but blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear." And all the way back in Exodus, I want to pull a scripture from Moses. Moses complaining he can't talk. He can't do anything right. And here's what God said to Moses. And the Lord said unto him, "Who hath made man's mouth? Or who maketh the dumb or the deaf or the seeing or the blind? Have not I the Lord. Who gives seeing eyes?" God. Who gives hearing ears? God. Who gives a heart that can perceive? God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how are you converted? Because God's grace bestowed upon you. Amen. A seed of eternal life. Amen. When you heard the word, you had ears to hear. You had eyes to see. Amen. You had a heart to perceive what made you different than somebody else because he set his love on you for no good reason that has to do with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a human being, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; So, this is what should give us compassion. &gt;&gt; This is what should set us apart. We should we should we should uh be able to re uh uh not relate but we should be able to interact with people on a totally different level because we should have an understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should have an understanding of how impossible it would be to serve God in this message without God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Impossible. In Romans chapter 11, he says, "God hath not cast away his people which he forneew. What you not that the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God again against Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and dig down thine altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image Baal." I love that. &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. I want to I want to read what he did not say. &gt;&gt; There are 7,000 men who kept themselves clean and didn't bow to the image Baal. &gt;&gt; Cuz if it said that, it would look like the strength of resisting was on the people. &gt;&gt; But the strength of resisting, the perversion in that day was in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't in the 7,000. It was in God who reserved to himself 7,000. And if God hadn't reserved to himself 7,000, none would be reserved. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's the fallacy of humanity. He said, even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. And if by grace then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace, otherwise work is no more work. I love this. I want to get into this, but I'm not going to get into this. Maybe some other time. I got to skip over it, even though I don't want to, but I I'm going to. Says, "What then? Israel hath not obtained that which it seeketh for, but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded." &gt;&gt; The rest were blinded. Abraham says, "Noah broke his covenant or the Noic covenant was broke. Adam's covenant was broke. anything that God makes with man. But God was determined and would save God was determined and would save man because he forneew man. And he was determined to save him. So he saved man by an unconditional covenant. Amen. No uncertainty about it. He said, "I will." It's holy by grace and unconditional, which makes it by grace. Not if you will, I will. Oh, how glad I am for that. Not what I am, but what he was. Amen. So when God come and chose Abraham, listen, he chose Abraham when Abraham was steeped in idolatry. &gt;&gt; He was an idoltor. He chose Abraham when he was living in of the Chaldes. &gt;&gt; He was living where Babylon was. He was living where the false religion broke out. He was an idoltor. His father was an idoltor. Listen, he didn't go choose Abraham because Abraham had some idea about God and had the truth and was holding on to the truth. He chose Abraham in the midst of his ignorance, in the midst of his false understanding about God. And he come and chose Abraham out of everybody else and said, "I choose you, Abraham, and I'm going to give you an inheritance and all the things he promised to Abraham." And none of it was based on the merit of Abraham. &gt;&gt; It was based on the election of God. &gt;&gt; What did Abraham do to get the promise of all that land? Yeah. &gt;&gt; I took him up on a on a hill and he says, "Look to the north and to the south, to the east and the west. As far as your eye can see, I've given it to thee and to all thy sea." What did he do to get that? I mean, what what what work did he do? What merit? What skills? What did he do? They only had one thing that he did that pleased God. And that was he believed God. &gt;&gt; And when God says something to him, he said, "Amen, Lord." And that, "Amen, Lord," come from something down inside Abraham that was given to him before the foundation of the world. And it was a little piece of God laying down in there. &gt;&gt; And he had the capacity to say when he heard the word, "That sounds right to me." And that the capacity didn't come from his brain. It came from his soul. &gt;&gt; And all he had to do was believe. &gt;&gt; All that's it. All he had to do was believe. And God says, "You got all this, you and all of your seed after you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is why the the nations have always been jealous of Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because the God just gave it to him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For no reason. &gt;&gt; No good reason. Just because he loved them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's so hard for some sisters when when one girl gets proposed to and she shows up at church with a diamond ring, it's hard not to feel that little bit of tinge. You're like, "Wait, she's not so special. I'm as good." Because why did that man put that ring on her? because he loved her. &gt;&gt; Not because she was the smartest, the best, the most able, the most eligible, the one who fixes the best cherry pie. &gt;&gt; Just because he loves her. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's the only reason. And God has chose chose his nation because he loved him. He chose us because he loves us. And he was going to keep his oath. So, it's good to be a child of Abraham because if you're a child of Abraham, you're part of this unconditional covenant. Not what you will, what he's already done. &gt;&gt; The message of grace, he says, think of it. Love and grace is sisters. Twin sisters. You can't have grace without love. They're twin sisters. That's exactly right. Before you can have grace, you have to have love. Before you can actually show somebody a favor, you love them. Right or wrong, you have to love them anyhow or you can't see. Love and grace is the same thing. They're just twin sisters. That's all. Love and grace. So, why are the recipients of our grace? Because he loves us. &gt;&gt; So, you know, you can say you can say why all you want to say why. &gt;&gt; Just keep on saying why. It doesn't matter why. The why doesn't matter. The fact is he loves us and he bestowed his grace upon us. And what kind of grace? Sovereign grace. That's the best kind. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't want church grace. You don't want a system grace. You don't want an organization grace. You don't want a formula grace or a creed grace. What you want is sovereign grace that comes from the sovereign. &gt;&gt; It's unquestionable. Amen. But that sovereign grace is based on love. Because before you can favor somebody, you have to love them. So he loved us from before the foundation of the world. You know, we know that to be true. There's not a person in here that would fail that test. The problem is accepting it all the time. &gt;&gt; Receiving that truth 100% of the time, every minute of the day. &gt;&gt; That's the challenge. &gt;&gt; That's where the war is going on. That's where the greatest battle ever fought going on in our mind to constantly align with that truth and not the lie. &gt;&gt; That's where the battle is. Cuz this is not earthshattering. This is not rocket science. This is not a brand new message, but this is something that we're struggling with that that many people in different people in different levels struggle with. And they're struggling with the battle in their mind because of the man in the mirror. &gt;&gt; That's why we need to to stop focusing on that man, but the one who gives sovereign grace. And Galatians said, "For in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision avaleth anything, nor un uncircumcision, but faith which workketh by love." Faith workketh by love. We're a recipient of our his love. We love him because he first loved us. That's what gives us faith to believe in him. Because he bestowed his love on us and there was something in us that could love him back. &gt;&gt; And that's how faith works. &gt;&gt; In Romans chapter 5, he says, "Moreover, the law entered that the offense might abound." Do you catch that? The law entered that everything man did was wrong would be more wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you remember brother Bam says they they instead of grace they asked for a law. They wanted something that they could do. So God gave them a law and the the law was perfect. There's not a thing wrong with the law. It's got the wisdom and character of God embedded in it. It's the word of God. It's not wrong in any way. The law is perfect. The problem is the men who tried to keep the law as a means to getting God's favor and and appropriating his love could never keep the law. &gt;&gt; So they kept themselves separated from God by the own law that they requested. Amen. So the law came so that sin might abound. &gt;&gt; Meaning once God says don't do this &gt;&gt; now every time you do that you know you're wrong. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Before if he's not specifically saying don't do that, it may not be God's plan. It may not be God's thought. It may not be God's character, but you don't know that it's wrong. Amen. So, you're just living in ignorance that they lived in before the law. Amen. On living by a law of conscience, doing what's right according to the conscience. Amen. But, but once the law came and said that is wrong, then it magnifies the nature fallen nature of man. And sin now abounds. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then the more laws you have, the more abounding sin is. So sin, law came so that sin might abound. Why would God give them a law? So that their sin would abound. Why would he put them in a hopeless situation that they and their fallen nature can never overcome? Because he wants them to realize in your fallen nature you can never overcome. Right? &gt;&gt; That way he can bring you into grace by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ so that you're ready to jump into grace and forsake the law and forget trying to be perfect and just accept the perfect one. &gt;&gt; Thank God says, "But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. Even for Israel, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though they were under law and they were constantly getting it wrong, grace still abounded. Because where where where the offense the law entered the defense might abound. Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. That was always the point. The point was always to magnify grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. That as sin hath reigned into death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. Listen. The children of God messed up. &gt;&gt; Is that a news flash? &gt;&gt; I can say it like this. The children of God mess up. &gt;&gt; Is that a news flash? But grace is abounding, friends, because of his love. Abraham got the commandment of the Lord and then he listened to his wife and took Ishmael and created a big mess. But God still bestowed grace upon Abraham and never removed his covenant from him. Noah messed up. David I mean David really messed up. I mean if there's degrees of messing up like in our mind there is. I don't know how God views that but in our mind there's degrees of messing up. David really really messed up &gt;&gt; but he never fell out of God's grace. You know something else that shocks me? Saul, the first king of Israel, he blew it. &gt;&gt; He was a failure almost from day one. He was lousy. He was horrible. He was no good. He was selfish, self-centered, self-focused, and disobedient. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And a coward. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't fight Goliath. &gt;&gt; Is that all true? &gt;&gt; Amen. But when he went to the witch of Endor, which he was a big hypocrite because he tried to put all the witches out because under Samuel's rule, he tried to look religious. Now he snuck around and found a witch. So he was playing the part of a gigantic hypocrite. &gt;&gt; So in his hypocrisy, he's going through the witch. And in hypocrisy and failure, Amen, the blessings of the Lord removed from him, the kingdom stripped from his hand. Is a disobedient, failed servant of God. He comes and they and the the and the and and this witch of Endorf brings up Samuel the prophet and Samuel says, "This day you'll be with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon pulls that out of the scripture and says, "See, amen. As bad as Saul was, he was still a child of God. He was still saved and he was going to go to wherever Saul was because where Saul was was where Abraham was &gt;&gt; or not not Saul &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; who's Sam? Samuel. Thank you guys. group participation will pass the test. Wherever Samuel was is where Abraham was. Amen. That wasn't the realm of the fallen. That wasn't the realm of the lost. And he says, "You'll be here with me wherever I am." And brother Brandham told us, amen, that he was a child of God. Amen. In all his dirty deeds and all his rottness, amen, he could never lose his sunship with God because he was chosen before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And if that can be true for Saul, what in the world? Praise God. &gt;&gt; Listen, I I just tell you this. I don't want to live Saul's life. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not looking for a Saul life. I'm not looking to mess up like David did. But what what I'm looking at is on the days when I don't get it right and I don't miss the mark. If Saul can be there in paradise, Amen. then if God can cover that by his grace. How did he cover that by his grace? Because he was looking forward to Calvary because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world. And he knew there would be an atonement. There would be a price paid for man's sin. &gt;&gt; That's why Saul didn't have to pay. That's why Saul didn't have to pay it. The debt was going to be paid and he could get credit for it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if that could work for Saul, what about me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying. I I'm I'm I want to do right. I've got a heart to do right. I'm trying to serve God with all my heart. Amen. And this old unwilly flesh of mind sometimes gets me in trouble. And I do things I'm ashamed of. And I do things I regret. And I do things when you get caught in a flash of a moment. Somebody asks a question and and all of a sudden you you blurt out something and later you realize that was complete fabrication. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then what do you do? You lose your sunship. You back up on grace. You throw in the towel. You don't go up to church the next service because there's no way I can be one of them. How can I stand there and sing one of them? &gt;&gt; One. We got to go back to the fundamentals. &gt;&gt; Say, listen, I'm not even worthy to come to church and raise my hands and sing praises to God. I'm not worthy to claim to be his bride. I'm not worthy to claim to know God's mind that's been revealed to us at the end. I'm not worthy to claim any of those things. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of what God has determined, what God has called me to, what God has revealed to me, and where he's placed me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to skip down here to Revelations 6 and N. This is the fifth seal. Says, "When he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true? Dust thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" And white robes were given unto every one of them. And it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season, unto their fellow servants also, and their brethren that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. So, brother B, when he comes in the seals, he comes to the fifth seal, and he reads this portion of scripture. And the question always was, who are these souls under the altar? And some thought they were the martyrs down through the church ages. And brother Benham himself thought they were the martyrs down through the church ages. But then God begins to reveal it to him. And it says they were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. Not the testimony of Jesus Christ. These weren't Christians. These are Jews. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said these are Jews that that that died from the time of Christ all the way to the catching away of the church. &gt;&gt; So for 2,000 years, that's where these Jews are under the altar. And and it says here, they cried with a loud voice, "How long, oh Lord, holy and true, does thou not judge and avenge our blood?" He says, "See, these are not Christians with the spirit of Christ." Because the spirit of Christ says, "Father, forgive them." They don't know what they're doing. They don't call for vengeance. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham clearly lays out that these are Jews and these are the Jews that are under the sacrifice altar from the time of Christ till the catching away of the church. &gt;&gt; We're on the same page. What altar are they under? Sacrifice altar. What sacrifice? The sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Why are they parked under that altar? Because that's where they find grace. &gt;&gt; That's the only place they can be sitting because they rejected their Messiah. They have not accepted Jesus Christ. They turned their back on their Messiah. So where does God park them when they when they leave this earth? He parks them right under the blood &gt;&gt; that they haven't yet accepted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, this is grace. This is grace. That means God can put you under blood before you accept blood. &gt;&gt; That's what he did through the whole Old Testament. He put them under the blood before they accepted the blood. Because the blood of Jesus Christ hadn't been shed yet on the earth. It was only shed in the mind of God. And God was foreshadowing that. Amen. What he was doing. Amen. Everybody was getting tucked away under grace, under grace, under grace, waiting, Amen, for the purchase of grace to purchase back the redemption price. &gt;&gt; So now all of these Jews who do not confess Jesus, do not believe in Jesus. We'll tell you there's no such thing as Jesus Christ. He was a false prophet. Will deny him and blaspheme? &gt;&gt; Do the Jews blaspheme? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They do. Where is he parking them? Under the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, the grace of God, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could ever just catch the grace of God and how perfect and pure and true it is, it should bring us into rest. Amen. It's rest that allows us to overcome our flesh. It's not tension. It's not spiritual tension and pressure where we have to act right, do right all the time. You get under that pressure, you're going to blow up somewhere. But what's the whole Christian experience is based on rest. When you rest, you perform. When you rest, you allow God to flow through you. Not when we're all tense. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This message of grace should bring us rest. Not spiritual laziness, not wickedness, not chasing sin, but a real spiritual rest that I'm secure in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, brother man begins to tell us now where they are under the sacrifice altar. He says, "And white robes were given unto every one of them." White robes is righteousness. Brother Bam says, "And they are declared righteous." Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; For what? &gt;&gt; It's by grace. Amen. They were given white robes. They didn't earn white robes. They didn't deserve white robes. They were given white robes. And the shame of their nakedness was clothed, &gt;&gt; covered in the righteousness of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was now time for the redemption. And brother Brenham said this takes place at the rapture of the church when they see that other realm depart. Amen. To go get their glorified bodies. Now they say, "But what about us?" Amen. So now it's the time of redemption to the Jews because the two witnesses are going to preach to the 144,000 and they are going to receive the atonement. They're going to receive Christ. They're going to receive the word. And when they on earth receive the word, Amen. It's accounted for the entire nation of Israel. So at this time he's giving them white rose because this is the catching away of the church and the ministry of the two witnesses coming on the earth &gt;&gt; and it happens by grace. &gt;&gt; This is what else brother Bam says. He says now watch they had in their blindness martyed their messiah and now they were reaping for it. They realized that they recognized after it was gone. They seen when then when they came after the altar of God but now the grace of God is to them. Now watch. Now they could not by no means be saints because they would already be robed. But here they are now just souls under the altar for the word of God and the testimony they held for being God's people and Jews. But now watch the grace of God comes to them and Jesus gives them each one a white robe. Watch. Plum over after the church is gone because they were loyal to their cause and they were blinded and they didn't know it. They didn't know it. They were playing exactly the part that God had ordained for them to play. And here John looks over and sees souls under the altar. Now watch. He sees these souls. Watch what he calls them. They cry, "Lord, how long?" "Just a little while longer." See, let's get that as we go down right through the scripture. They realized they'd murdered their Messiah. And they didn't know it, but they they realized they got murdered back to pay for it, for doing the wrong. And now look what a thing they had to do. See, they was guilty of murder. So they got murdered. See, they cried out, "His blood be on us." See, that's right. And they were blinded. Now, if they hadn't been blinded, God said, "Let them alone. They're not worthy." But being that they was blinded by God, his grace reached down to them. Amen. Talk about amazing grace. And give each one of them a robe because all Israel will be saved. Everyone that has his name written. He says this, "And God said he gave each one of them a robe undeserving as they was, but his grace to blind them so that we could see." &gt;&gt; Why did he blind them &gt;&gt; for us? &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; don't begrudge them their robe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz they were blinded so we could see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "Now see these are given robes, each one of them. And now I want you to notice. But now God's grace stoops to them. Jesus gives them each a white robe like Joseph did his grace to his brethren. He types it with Joseph with the how no matter how wicked they were to him and how evil and how wrong they did him. Amen. When it comes to the end, he bestows grace upon them and he cares for them and he bestows gifts upon them and he feeds them and clothe them. Amen. And he says, "You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good." This is God's grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's all by grace. Again, in the fifth seal, he says, "Now our settle it for those souls under the altar of the breaking of the seal that had been slain in the time between the death of Christ and the going up of the church." I just wanted to put that in there so we could see the time frame. So, it's all those Jews down through there. God had reserved for them something because he blinded them for our sake. And because he blinded them and they could not receive it, amen, he was going to put them under grace. So he kept parking them under the sacrifice altar until they could receive Christ as a nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful friends. &gt;&gt; The plan of God is so perfect. His grace for us, his grace for them. Look at the strength of grace. &gt;&gt; 2,000 years of denying a Messiah. 2,000 years of claiming Christians are wrong. 2,000 years of calling him a false prophet and they still get white robes. &gt;&gt; That's the power, the strength of grace. It's stronger than wrong conduct. It's stronger than misunderstanding. It's stronger than being mistaken. It's stronger than a failure. Grace is stronger than anything you can do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to be a recipient of grace. &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that'll work for me. I have nothing else to offer. I need his grace. Amen. I'm going to go back to this quote that I skipped and read it together as we close. Now if someone or other the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God, there came a year called the Jubilee year. And every seven years they had a rest, a Sabbath. And every seven days they had a Sabbath. Every seven years they had a Sabbath. And seven Sabbaths was 49 years. And the 50th year was a jubilee. And in this Jubilee, every man that had lost his inheritance by some means, if he was a free-born and true-blooded Israelite, no matter who held the possession, it had to go back to him free. He didn't have to pay a thing. He didn't have to do a thing, but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance. Oh my. He had a right to it. It was a God-given right because he by grace had inherited it and it had been given to his fathers and handed down year after year. No matter what had taken place, if he lost it, it must it must go free. It meant grace is way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance. What a picture it gives us tonight of the church in this last days. You see what man can do and when you see what God does, what man does is failing and will fail, has failed, and always will fail. Hardy amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what God does is eternal and must forever remain. Nothing can ever take it away. God give it. It's his free gift. And by sovereign foresight saw it and placed it. And there's nothing can ever move it. It's there eternally. And at Jubilee was God's manner of expressing grace to his people for the restoring are being brought back to their rightful position. So God all the way back in the Old Testament under the law, he set up the law of return and jubilee. And the law of return, return and jubilee is a picture of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God set a picture of grace in the law for all of them to learn. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were in the midst of the law, but they were under grace. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Under the law of return and jubilee. Because the law of return was every seven years if a man had sold himself a bonds slave because he had debts he could not pay and he needed money he could sell himself in as a bond slave to pay off his debts. But at the end of seven years when the trumpet would blow he could go free. &gt;&gt; Why could he go free? He could go free because God says when the trumpet blows you can go free. &gt;&gt; That's the only reason. He didn't have to pay any money. He didn't have to get a ransom. He didn't have to speak for him. He didn't need a letter from the high priest. Amen. The law was written because this is grace. If you mess up and you don't manage your affairs or you fall into trouble or you do something foolish and you have to sell yourself as a bonds slave, there's a period of grace coming. When you hear the trumpet, that's grace to you. You can go back. Amen. Not because you straightened up your act or you became nice or you &gt;&gt; just because &gt;&gt; then at the end of seven Sabbaths 49 years at the end of that there's a 50th year. The 50th year is the Jubilee year. The Jubilee year, Amen, returns all the land of your inheritance. So if you got in financial trouble and you sold your land off, Amen. that land can only be removed from you for a certain period of time. But when the Jubilee call came, when the trumpet sounded, you could go back and take your land back. &gt;&gt; And you didn't have to pay a dime for it. You didn't have to do work for it. You didn't have to do anything. All you had to do is walk back into it because it was yours. &gt;&gt; What is this? This is grace that's embedded in the law. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that land was given to them without effort, without merit, without money, without price. God says, "This is my land and I give it to you as an inheritance." &gt;&gt; So each of their fathers when they were given a portion of land, how much did they pay for that portion of land when it was divided out by Joshua and he and he gave each one a certain portion? What did they pay for it? &gt;&gt; How did they earn it? Nothing. God gave it to him freely. That land was grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then they would do something themselves, their own act that would remove them from God's grace. But in God's grace, he had a fail safe. You're never going to be permanently removed from my grace. You can never be permanently removed from the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he laid the picture in the Old Testament so we could learn something. There is no way, no matter what you do or how vile you are or many mistakes you make, you can get separated from your inheritance. You can be sold into slavery of addiction, sold into slavery of finance, sold into all kinds of slavery that you do yourself. But praise God, if you ever hear that Jubilee trumpet, that's grace to bring you back to your right position, back to your original, which was your original grace. &gt;&gt; Why were they freeborn Israelites? What made them free men in their own land? They didn't pay for it. They didn't earn it. They didn't redeem themselves. God redeemed them out of the hand of Pharaoh. He purchased them with all the plagues. &gt;&gt; He paid the price. He redeemed them and brought them out. So they were freeborn by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't they can't ever say, "I'm fighting for my rights to be free. I'm a free man because my father's f No. Your fathers didn't fight for it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember the plagues? God fought for it. He stoned. He sent plagues. He turned the water to blood. He He He destroyed the firstborn. You didn't do a thing. You're freeborn by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you have the land by grace. &gt;&gt; It's all by grace. So no matter how much you mess up, God is going to make sure you're never his children are never permanently separated from his grace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise God. What have we heard? What is the message? The message is the Jubilee trumpet, friends. It's the call of your return to grace. You can go back to all that you were originally intended to be. what you were in the mind of God, the picture he took of you before the foundation of the world, the purpose he had for you on this earth in 2025. If you can hear that trumpet, you don't have to pay money. You don't have to earn it. You don't have to be a good person. You don't have to do anything. All you got to do is drop whatever you're doing and walk back into your position as a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let nobody fool you. You don't have to start getting things right first. You just walk back into it and God will get it all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the Jubilee call. Amen. And if you listen, we all get into all kinds of circumstances. We all get into all kinds of twisted ideas and things in our mind. And you may not uh you may you may be a believer. You may be in the message. You may be here today, but you got yourself sold in those. A bond slave to something, &gt;&gt; right? to your work, to your finances, to entertainment, &gt;&gt; to elicit things, to you may be a bondslave to some greed, some pride, &gt;&gt; but listen, you don't have to stay in that condition. &gt;&gt; And you may have got there by your own doing. &gt;&gt; I mean, you if you got there, you certainly did by your own doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's already something embedded in the word of God. &gt;&gt; There's already grace to bring us back to our position of grace. &gt;&gt; What do I need to do, brother Chad? Wait seven years. No, sir. We're at the end of seven years. &gt;&gt; We're at the end of 49 years. This is the 50th year. You don't have to wait for anything. Don't wait to get your act together. Come back into your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't wait till you can clean yourself up and fix yourself and get over your addictions and stop tobacco and and stop entertainment and stop all of that. You don't have the power to stop it. Get back in your land and let him wash you by the washing of the water of the word. Connect back to the grace of God that called you without merit, without price, without earning anything, just because he loved you the same way he loved Saul on the road to Damascus. The same way he loved Peter washing his net, he loves you the same way and he calls you the same way. And you get the same kind of grace they all got. &gt;&gt; You may have done it to yourself. You may be tangled up in your mind right now because you've allowed images and you've allowed thoughts and you've allowed circumstances to bring bitterness to bring confusion to bring &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay a bondslave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're a son and a daughter of God. I encourage you tonight, hear the trumpet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does it sound like, Brother Tad? It sounds exactly like it sounded for the last hour. That's the trumpet. Come back to your position. Come back to grace. Come back to the thought God had of you before the foundation of the world. Go free, my brothers and sisters. Don't stay in slavery. Don't stay out of the land. &gt;&gt; What is the land? The land is the word of God. It's been restored to us. Every promise in the book is mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those potatoes are mine. That corner is mine. That house is mine. &gt;&gt; It may have had denominational squatters on it for nearly 2,000 years, but the reality, every promise in that book is mine. Every truth is mine. Everything he said he would do for any believer is mine. If he said he'd heal, it's mine. If he said he'd deliver, it's mine. If he said I can go free, it's mine. &gt;&gt; Without a purchase price. The purchase price was made 2,000 years ago. It's mine because he set up the law of Jubilee in return. &gt;&gt; And I'm returning under this Jubilee to my position as a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay where you are. &gt;&gt; Don't let invisible chains bind you. &gt;&gt; Don't let mental circumstances keep you from moving all the way in. Shed those chains. You don't have to stay there after the trumpet call. If you stay there, you stay there voluntarily. You don't have to stay in that condition. Come back to God. Come back to your position. Claim your rights as a son of God and see what God does for you. &gt;&gt; Because there's a law in the land because the supreme deity, the judge of heaven and earth has come down. Has anybody seen the white wicked one in our day in 1963 when you turn the picture to the right? What was it? It was the judge, the supreme deity, the authority of all heavens and earth. And what is he here to do? He's here to enforce your inheritance rights. &gt;&gt; He's here to make sure you go free, you get healed, you get delivered, and whatever the devil's used to bind you up, that those chains are broken because the enforcer is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you stay back and don't believe that that trumpet calls for you &gt;&gt; and not really sure if you're in the original herand and I'm not really sure if my name's in the book and I can't exactly say because I don't have all these qualities &gt;&gt; then you never get the benefit &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; of return in Jubilee. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way you get the benefit is if you believe you're part of the original inheritance &gt;&gt; and your name is on the marriage certificate, the lamb's book of life. If you can't believe that, you stay in slavery. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true. &gt;&gt; Said, God, by your grace, grant us faith to believe. Grant us the faith to simply believe what you said about us and stop believing what every other voice in my head is telling me. &gt;&gt; Help me come back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's just stand. Let's just end there tonight. How many want to go back? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, you're going to get stuck in your mind somewhere again. Don't think this is the last time you hear the Jubilee Call. That's why we keep coming back to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody does us wrong. We get stuck in bondage again in our head. We just got resentment towards him. We can't seem to get over the bitterness. Amen. Don't stay there. Come back to church and hear the Jubilee call once again. &gt;&gt; We get our feelings hurt. We get we get knocked down by life. We get trampled on by the world. We have people do us legitimately wrong. And all of a sudden, all these thoughts start coming in and we find ourselves emotionally bound up again. And listen, this isn't the last time you'll go free, but this isn't the last time you'll hear the Jubilee call because the message is being preached day after day after day. And it is the call to freedom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Recognize what the devil's trying to do to bind you, to keep you from your position and your inheritance. And resist that devil. Flee. If you resist him, he'll flee and you come back to your position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Claim it. Speak it. If God's stirred in your heart, don't be afraid to say, "I'm a son of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you're afraid to say it, how will you get the benefit of it? The devil will keep plaguing you in your mind. There's got to be something rise up inside and said, "By the grace of God, I am what I am." Unworthy creature that I am. Un undeserving of I am of salvation, but by the grace of God, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. Let that truth trump all other truths. &gt;&gt; That by the grace of God, I am what I am. You say, "Well, but you're not much of a message believer." Yeah, I I I may not be much of one, but I am one. &gt;&gt; I never claimed to be a good son of God. I I I never claimed to be the best. I never claimed to get it right. I never even claimed that the the I never claimed anything except I am one. &gt;&gt; How can you say it so boldly? I say it by faith. I don't look at my merit because I can't say that looking at myself. &gt;&gt; I can only say that by the faith he's bestowed upon me. The quickening in my heart. The reality when I hear the word preach, it clicks, clicks, clicks, clicks. &gt;&gt; And I know it's who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not the man that looks me in the mirror because that guy is my biggest enemy. That's the one that keeps getting me sold into slavery. &gt;&gt; That's right. But it's what's down in here that connects with the reality of this grace. &gt;&gt; That's what's predestinated. Anyways, &gt;&gt; brother Bram said, "It's not the person that comes predestinated." &gt;&gt; This is where we stumble, friends. &gt;&gt; It's not the person that comes predestinated. It's the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or the word that thought of God he had before the foundation and chose to place in your soul and put that soul in your flesh. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So don't stumble around. We stumble because we keep stumbling with the person. &gt;&gt; Person's failed. Person's messed up. Person has wrong thoughts. Person keeps falling into temptation. Person keeps falling into the same traps. Well, hey, good news. It's not the person that comes predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the seed. &gt;&gt; And it's the seed that believes. &gt;&gt; It's the seed that has life. It's the seed that's eternal life. It's the seed. Listen, what's going to change your atoms? What's going to change you to a glorified body? When the word that you've held in your heart begins to materialize a new body around the word that's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I thank God for his truth. I thank God for the strength of his grace. &gt;&gt; It's stronger than my flesh &gt;&gt; and it has to be or there's no hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, God. So absolutely thrilled with this truth, Lord. God, we were all everyone hopeless cases until you got a hold of us, till you quickened your life within us by your spirit. We were everyone destined for trouble. We were everyone left to our own devices. We were everyone sinking. But God, it's your grace that has sounded the Jubilee trumpet to call us back to what you want us to be. God, this robe of righteousness we're wearing, it's not ours. We didn't stitch it together. We didn't sew it. We didn't harvest the material for the fabric. But we are clothed in your righteousness. What you are and what you've done and what you've determined and what you've paid for, and you've put it on us by imputation. And God, we stand here clothed, pure, clean, the sinless, spotless, virtuous bride of yours. Not by our merit, but by yours. Not by our idea, by yours. Not by our plan, but by yours. You've placed something, a deposit within us that can believe. And God, we believe. Lord Jesus, I pray that you'd help your children to break free. May this trumpet call be a call to return. May they hear the return trumpet tonight, Lord. And may they throw down wrong thoughts and worry and anxiety and whatever's twisting them up and binding them as sons and daughters. May they throw it down and return back to their position as free sons and daughters of God. May this voice of mine, Lord, that the word coming forth, may it be a trumpet call of Jubilee. May they run back and embrace their full inheritance and every promise that you've given. And may you bring healing and deliverance and restoration. I pray in Jesus name. If there's addictions, I pray you would break them, Lord. God, if there's misunderstandings, I pray you would correct them, Lord. God, if there's hurts that are too much to overcome, I pray you'd heal them, Lord, for you've promised it. And this is the Jubilee call. This is the hour for restoration. God, help us, Lord, to stay free, to go free, remain free. For you've given us that privilege in your message of grace. God, we thank you that your grace is stronger than our weakness. Your grace is stronger than our mind. Your grace is stronger than our feelings. Your grace is stronger than our decisions. It's your grace that's stronger than all. And so, Lord, we thank you for your grace this evening. We love you. You loved us so that we could love you and we want to love you more. We want to be uh we want to walk in greater understanding of that grace, greater revelation of that grace. May it bring peace and confidence to us to walk with you. We love you, God. We ask for your blessing over all said and done. May your children go forth free. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. And God bless you, brother Black. The sun is up. Now I can go free.
