God you are always faithful to keep your promise and your goodness to us your mercy to us as Without End your mercies are new Every Morning Lord we're so grateful to stand in this place but we've come Lord to fellowship with one another but we've come to hear your word we've come to receive from you that portion that you've reserved for this day a special portion Lord that only you can meet out for God you know what portion needs to come in due season Lord and God we're just asking that you would take control of this festival and that you would bring your word the way you desired to bring it and God I pray you would help me just to stay out of the way and stay surrendered to your spirit and May come and take absolute control and speak through these lips of clay Lord I pray that you give us ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that you're speaking to us in this day may you be glorified may you be honored may we honor and respect you as your word comes forth may we receive it Lord with gladness and with joy and may it translate into a life within us Lord we love you and we ask that you would come and break the bread of life this evening in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen God bless you it's certainly good to be here with you this evening amen it's good to see more and more coming back after bouts of sickness so praise the Lord I hope that that has passed us for this season but may God be glorified he's been good to us if um if you could while we're standing let's turn to the book of Isaiah Isaiah 61 also want to let you know that uh at the communion service we took a vote for the trustees in the super uh Sunday School superintend it and all were confirmed once again by the body and they expressed their confidence in these brothers so we thank God for that and thank God for all of you being here to take part in that amen God has certainly provided everything that we have need of amen amen let's begin reading here in Isaiah 61 um I'm going to begin in verse one Isaiah 61 verse one the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek Heath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord we know that when Jesus was present he took the scroll when he read that scripture and he said this day this scripture uh this what did he say Amen say it again fulf this day the script fulfilled amen praise the Lord that's the word I was looking for this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes and then he sat down and glorious words proceeded from his mouth amen but that brother B said was his first coming the second part pertains to his second coming and that pertains to our day and here's what he says next uh I I'll read verse two again to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord comma that's where he stopped in the day of the Vengeance of our God to comfort all that more and so the day of the Vengeance of our God is this day this is the day that the Lord will take Vengeance he comes as a judge judgment has already begun and it will continue on and break loose completely in the tribulation period but he listen to what else he says to comfort all that mourn so it's not just only judgment but there's also a comforting portion in the second comment to ano to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heavy this that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified that's the part that pertains to us amen amen God bless you as you're seated may the Lord bless us as we look into his word so the part I want to pull out of there is the U the planting of the Lord that we might be Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord not our planting his planting we didn't plant ourselves we didn't put ourselves here we didn't do he did it at all amen so it's the planting of the Lord so let's turn together to Matthew 13 and I'm going to I want to look at two Parables today and I'm going to mainly focus on these two Parables and I want to um I want to look at both of them one right after the other and and and tie them together in Matthew 13 let's begin by reading verse 24 Matthew 13:24 he says here another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and S tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tears he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather you together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat unto my barn so this is the the parable the parable of of of the man this is the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a man which swed good seed in his field so it's about a man sowing good seed into his field then afterwards comes an enemy now when Jesus goes to interpret this he picks it up here in verse 34 I and I want to read just ahead of where he begins the interpretation verse 34 he says all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spake he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world so this Parable is a secret that's been kept a truth that's been kept secret from the foundation of the world verse 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field he answered and said unto them he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that SED them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and nashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the Kingdom of their father who ha ears to hear Let Him hear so this Parable is a secret that's been kept secret a truth been kept secret from the foundation of the world and we see it explains to us the serpent seed how let's go back up to verse 30 uh 37 he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the W Wicked one so into the world was sown a good seed and that good seed were the children of the Kingdom but after the good seed were swn into the field Along Came an enemy and the enemy SED another kind of seed and that other kind of seed became the tears brother frankco if you could pull up the Whiteboard I'm going to go to it here just in a second so I want us to recognize that the good seed are the children of the Kingdom brother Bram said in modern events in 1965 he said then if you are a son of God or a daughter of God you were in God all the time but he knew what bed in time that you'd be planted he knew when you would come forth because he SED good seed into his field which is the world and he SED his good seed into his field because he owned the world and he knew when that seed when that crop would come up in what season he knew you would be sitting here tonight he knew when you would come forth he knew what was going to happen in our lives he knew what bed in time that you would be planted so now you're made a creature a Son of God manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time that's right you was done there before the foundation of the world so before the foundation of the world God sowed seed he SED seed into the world and he knew when those seeds would spring forth he knew when you were going to come on the scene and you were predestinated for for the day and age that you sprung forth amen because this is what he said you were made a creature a Son of God manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of the hour what challenge of what hour the hour that you're living in that's when you came forth that seed was made to meet the challenge of the hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time so if we go if we go here oh I hope I get this right so if we look at the seed in this Parable the seed are the children of the Kingdom all right so the seed that was sowed was the children of the Kingdom that means you and I were part of that seed that good seed amen all right Mark 4 let's go over and look at this other Parable now this is the second one that I want to look at and compare with this one Mark 4 and verse 2 and he taught them many things by Parables and said unto them in his Doctrine hearken behold there went out a s to sew and it came to pass as he sewed some fell by the wayside and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up and some fell on Stony ground where it had not much Earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of Earth but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away and some fell among thorns and the Thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 and some 60 and some 100 then he comes down to the interpretation in verse 13 let's just skip down there and he said unto them know you not this Parable and how then will you know all Parables the swer Seth the word so what was the seed that the sewer went forth to sow that seed was the word right the swer SED the word and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts and these are they likewise which are sown on Stony ground who when they had heard the word immediately received it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a Time afterward when Affliction or persecution arises for the word's sake immediately they are offended and these are they which are swn among Thorns such as hear the word and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choked the world and it it became unfruitful and these are they which are swn on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some 30-fold some 60 some 100-fold so now we're going to look at this Parable in this Parable the seed now in this Parable is not the children of the Kingdom but this seed is the word so we want to look at both of these Parables together it's amazing how sometimes uh when when God is using a parable he'll use a parable of a seed being swn and that seed is the children of the Kingdom then he makes a parable of seed being swn and that seed being sown is the word and I'd like to take for a title uh for tonight word comes to word word comes to word and we're going to find out that there is a direct correlation between these seeds praise be to God brother M says in the greater than Solomon is here he said all that the father has given me will come and I'm happy for that so we don't know who is and who is not we just scatter forth the seed that's all we can do some Falls by the wayside some Falls this way and that way but some does fall on good ground that's that that ground that's been prepared by God to receive the seed so some Falls this way some Falls that way and brother B says we don't know who's who or what's what we just scatter this seed we just preach the word we just witness we testify we do whatever amen and some Falls this way some Falls that way amen and it's not our responsibility where it falls it's only our responsibility to scatter it but he says but some falls on good ground ground that's been prepared by God to receive the seed so what is good ground good ground is predestinated ground ground that's been prepared by God to receive the seed he says in works of Faith Express from 1965 any seed has to have its ground of course I want you to catch that don't don't let that slip by any seed has to have its ground now if you think about that if I'm going to plant blueberries I need acidic soil if I'm going to plant cedar trees I need a certain kind of soil but if I'm going to PL plant oak trees I need a different kind of soil amen there's a there's ground for every soil amen and some some things grow better in different kinds of ground that's clear you you see a diverse species when you go into the mountains into the valleys and different levels of the mountains at different elevations there's different species of trees and plants because they all have their ground amen so a seed has to have the right kind of ground for that seed to grow so any seed has to have its ground of course therefore all he before knew see he already knew what was going to happen notice Jesus said again about the seeds some fell on rocks others on mixed ground see over where there's Thorns thistles and everything else it could grow it couldn't grow and others on good ground good ground good soil which had been prepared already prepared you know when we look at this brother B's using this uh uh a parable and he's looking at the good ground and he's showing that that's predestined ated Ground God knew where that seed would fall so the ground is prepared ground prepared ahead of time it was prepared for the seed ever got there it wasn't prepared after the seed got there so if you're farming and in the analogy and you prepare a field amen you select the field that you want Amen to sew the seed in and in that field you clear away the stones and then you break up the stumps and you cut down the trees you do whatever you're going to do to prepare this field for seed and then you disc it and till it and you do whatever you're going to do before you sew the seed in it amen so whatever plot was carved out of the Wilderness was by the choice of the farmer it was his choice and he prepared it he predestinated it before the seed ever got there amen so it's not the ground preparing itself to receive the seed amen it was already prepared Amen to receive this seed all right so the seed goes everywhere so that you know the scriptures can be used in many many ways and each Parable and each each story can be used and many times we use this Parable Amen to to try to to encourage people don't let the cares of Life choke you out amen don't be a shallow believer and don't be all that but that's not really the depth of the meaning of this amen it can be used that way and certainly it's not wrong all those things remain true but that ground didn't prepare itself that ground was already prepared this is different categories of people this is this is a predestinated people that's prepared by God to receive this seed and this seed won't grow in this ground or that ground or this ground this seed will only grow in the prepared ground the predestinated ground and when that seed will go in there the acidic is just right the mineral content is just right it's got everything it needs for that seed to to to rot to to uh root to grow amen and bear fruit he says in the parable in verse 20 it said and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit so what is the good ground the good ground let's look again the good ground hears the word and receives it and brings forth fruit how do you know where the good ground is it's not just the one that says uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh that's not the good ground amen the good ground is the one that hear the word receive the word and bring forth fruit that's the right kind of predestinated ground right so now the seed is the children of the Kingdom but when we come down here the children of the kingdom is also the good ground that this seed is going to be swn into so we're talking about two seed seeds amen one is one is the children of God one is the word of God one is the good ground one is the seed but every seed has to have its ground and every ground has to be prepared for the seed and these two things have to come together to bring forth fruit amen you can't just have a seed laying there that seed's got to go into the ground amen so you can't just have seed without ground you can't have ground without seed but when you have seed that goes into the right kind of ground then what do you have you have fruit that life that's in that seed comes forth and manifest and brings forth fruit amen let's go to Acts chapter 13 Acts Chapter 13 Verse 46 acts 13 and: 46 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation into the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed amen they were the good ground amen they were the seed that had been sown amen by the son of man into the Earth amen and they could receive they were the good ground that was PR prepared ordained to receive the seed that Paul and Barnabas came sewing the Jews couldn't receive it amen because the prophecy over Paul was that he would be a light unto the Gentiles and light to the end for salvation to the end of the world but he first had to come to the the Jews the Jews had to reject it what the seed that he had wasn't for them right then amen so they rejected it but there was a prepared soil amen and and listen uh uh Paul did not have to make the soil prepared the soil was already prepared all Paul had to do was seow the seed and he sowed the seed and some rejected it wrong soil some received it right soil amen for for us I mean we sew the seed all the time and sometimes it looks like it's falling into good ground like this is good ground it'll surely take amen but we don't know the the the content of that soil we don't know the makeup of that soil and that that seed goes right in there and can never come to life and we're sure that they'll take it we're sure that they'll believe it I mean they already look like a Believer they already act like one I'll give them the word and they'll take it and nothing happens then we look at a plot of land and it looks overgrown it doesn't look like nothing's going to grow here amen and you sew the seed and lo and behold we're surprised they actually believe it amen like I told them and they didn't stumble I said something about serpent SE and they said I could see that that soil was prepared soil Paul didn't have to prepare the soil we we are not here to to preach a Reformation to till up ground and make it good-look soil so we could sew the seed we're just here to sew the message of the hour the true Revelation the word of God for this day and there's already a prepared soil that'll meet this it'll find its place amen it'll go to the right place we don't have to to worry about it we don't have to strain we don't we don't have to get upset and listen when when the SE SE the seed so went out to se seed a mean there was a lot of it that that looked like it took you know it took and it sprang up but before it could ever come to fruit it withered away you know we've seen that you've seen that it can be discouraging but don't worry it's not your fault you know the seed swer is never criticized in this Parable he's not told that he's loud and he's no good and he's spilling seed everywhere he's never criticized the problem wasn't with the seed sore the problem was with the soil with the ground so for us we don't need to worry about it God's got prepared soil out there we've got a bag full of seed and there's prepared soil somewhere that's not my responsibility I'm not responsible for making the soil right and prepared I'm only responsible for sharing amen praise God now brother R says and the God who is rich in Mercy from 1965 says many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was a god somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then what was that that seed that the son of man swed into the field it was that form of life in you then brother vom calls it a form of life he calls it a seed calls it a gene he calls it an attribute he calls it part of the word and it was in you all along he said then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of God you had to to be part of the word so you are part of God you come from God within you is a part of God an attribute or a gene or part of the word a seed all that's in you is part of God so if you're part of God you have to be part of the word so let's read this again one day you being part of God you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word listen now the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it now let's look at that the word seen the word which word saw what word amen there was a word in here and there was a word for the age amen and and one saw the other and one saw this and this one saw that what however they saw what saw what I don't know but they came together they were magnetized to one another the word seen the word that was in you that was before the the foundation World saw the word and you come to it why cuz you was prepared ground let's go to John chapter 6 John chapter 6 verse 63 Jesus speaks here says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so the word itself is Spirit the word itself is life so down in you was a little form of life what was that part of the word the the message of the hour has what in it life it's part of the word so there's a life that's going to connect with a life there's Spirit that's going to connect with the spirit because the word I speak to you is Spirit the the spirit and the spirit is going to come together the life and the life is going to come together the word and the word is going to come together amen I want to I want to go to a new sheet here but there's several quotes that I just pulled little phrases out because I want to uh write some things down here on the board I want to look at these things together in the fourth seal brother bam said the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form so the spirit and the word are the same thing amen the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form then in the message perseverance from 63 says God and the word is the same this is God on print and he's holding his Bible so God equal to the word in trying to do God a service from 1965 he says Christ is the word so Christ is the word am says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said the Bible is Christ he is the word but brother Bram just said that this is God in print form but then he said the Bible is Christ so is the Bible God or is the Bible Christ I love it it's so simple now let's go let's go uh before we go any further let's go to F uh first John turn with me all the way back to the end of the New Testament and go with me to First John chapter 5 so 1 John chapter 5 1 John 5 and verse 7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one all right so we know that these three are one all right it doesn't say the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit it's the father and the word and the Holy Spirit and these are one and brother Brenham says the the spirit is the word he says God is the word Christ is the word God is the Bible Christ is the Bible praise God now let's go to the next quote now in Christ is the mystery of God he says how did he what happened in the prefigure now he opened Adam's side and took part of his flesh which was Adam to make Eve the bride has to be the word for he is the word so where did the Bride come from she came out of Christ so out of Christ comes the bride so she is part of Christ and she is part of Christ then she has to be part of the word because Christ is the word so out of Christ amen remember he said he smot him under the rib on Calvary and took out of him the elements just like he he took one of the ribs of Adam and he made the woman and he took the elements the water and the blood and he made his church he made his bride and she is and she is uh uh she is flesh and bone of Jesus Christ according to the scriptures so she is part of Christ and being part of Christ Christ is the word she's also part of the word praise be to God now let's look at this next one now you see the seals when he was in his mediator work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him so in this book of redemption in this title deed the book of redemption The Book of Life the Bible the the the record of Christ whatever you want to call this book amen he says the book is him which is Christ but what is the Believers the words in the book so that means the bride is part of that book and that book is Christ amen she's part of the book praise God let's keep going in the in the message it is the rising of the sun he says why he's an eagle an eagle to an eagle the word before the foundation the word to the word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position he hunts for it he's talking about the parable of the mama Eagle hunting out her baby the Eagle's hunting out that lost eagle and that Eagle's down in the chicken yard thinking it's a chicken hatched out under a hen doesn't have its identification doesn't know who it is properly until the eagle flies over and when the eagle flies over amen and lets out a scream whatever's inside of that eagle identifies with that scream and recognizes and there's a resonation on the inside and then realizes it's an eagle because it looks up sees an eagle and goes to fly and then brother BM takes that story says it's an e Eagle to an eagle amen the word before the foundation the word to the word the word predestinated amen that's the seed that was swn into the field the word predestinated to the written word for the hour that's the word to Seer sewing the word comes to the word the word of the the seed of the word comes to that seed that was planted by the son of man before the foundation of the word and that's good ground and then when the word comes to the word then it manifests the life inside that seat seed and brings forth fruit some 60 some 30 some 60 some 100-fold evidence that it's good ground so let me go here so when we look at a son or daughter of God we know that they are the word they are part of the word they come out of God which is the word they are part of Christ which is the the word they are they are the word and then we know that the scriptures is the word so now we know that the word comes to the word so now the scripture comes to the predestinated word what is this the word for this season comes to the predestinated word so the word comes to the word and the word comes to the word they are magnetized for one another they are predestinated to go together the seed that was planted he knew what bed and ground you would come forth and he knew he knew what ground he would prepare for the last day for the very last uh the last of the Gentile dispensation the wrapping up of all time and he knew what word to bring forth and he knew where to sew this word because he doesn't bring forth his word in season and have no place to plant that word he doesn't just let it float around amen realize he's got to have a ground already prepared to receive that word or else he doesn't bring the word on the scene right brother bam taught us that that that every farmer knows when to plant seed he said you don't plant corn amen the same time you plant beans you don't plant beans the same time you plant wheat you have to know your seasons and know when to bring the seed out of the seed bag and cast it on the ground you got to have it in the right season and God's not here he's not bringing Lutheran seed and casting it out in the wrong season because it won't grow right but he's got the right word for the right season he's got a ground prepared and everything is just right and so he bring the seed forth cuz he's already got a ground that'll receive it when God starts breaking the word and breaking the word it's evidence he's already got ground here that that seed was predestinated to land in to do what not to say I got the seed I got the seed no it's supposed to land in good ground to bring forth fruit that's inside the seed you say I got the seed I got the seed that's no more than the guy who's casting out the bag of seed saying I got the seed I got the seed but but it's got to go into the ground it's got to come forth It's got to grow through the process of growth and it's got to bear fruit which is the life of the seed praise God Amen woo I like it I know for most of us this is review but I love the review amen I love the reality so now we come here and we see the word the word is Christ or Christ is the word but we know that the word is also God Amen right and we know that the word is also Spirit right so God if I could write this down here is the originator of the word the word came from God the Word was God the word is God it never lost its God property but it came out of God it's the mind of God on display he's the originator of the word the spirit brother B says is the life of the word and he also says that's the life of the word and lifegiver to the word am and Christ is the Living Word the anointed word for your day it's the word that's living present tense Christ has always been the present tense Living Word not was not will be it was Christ in Noah yes it was Christ in Jeremiah but that's not Christ now that's where Christ was Christ is always present tense the anointed word The Living Word so God is the originator of the word he's still the word the word is still him amen uh the spirit is the life of the word or the lifegiver to the word and Christ is the Living Word so what is the bride today the bride today is supposed to be the manifested Living Word she's a part of Christ Christ is being displayed in her form he's manifesting himself amen she is part of the word praise God not going to go any further with that now I want to get into the next part this is this is what I really get excited about in The patmas Vision in 1960 he says man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did he not say in Mark 11:12 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what youve said what happens when two omnipotents meet when God and man comes together through omnipotence something's got to shake whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met what what two omnipotence have met amen the seed the word the the the the life of God in inside a child of God with the the the word for this age when those two come together amen there's Faith to believe it it falls in good ground what is that that's two omnipotence coming together and when two omnipotence coming together you can't stop the word from manifesting amen why because it's God in God it's Christ in Christ it's the word in the word do you understand God did it before the foundation of the world he's the son of man that sowed seed into his field he prepared the ground ahead of time he brought the right SE right the right seed in the right season and brought forth the right soil at the right time and he made sure the two got together he sent a seed sewer your way one day amen and that seed sewer may have tossed seed Here There and Everywhere amen but he happened to get some over in your field and when it come into your field amen two omnipotence come together and your life changed what religion couldn't do for you before what did nomination couldn't do for you before when this predestinated seed of the hour the anointed word for the hour hit the good ground of the predestinated seed in your soul the two come together two omnipotence met and your life changed you quit talking the way you talked you quit walking the way you walk you quit thinking the way you thought that wasn't you cleaning up your life that was the seed coming to its resting place that was the word coming to the word the word predestinated and the word for this age came together it's worked in every age and it works in this age it's the power that's being released in our lives it's not us working our way into something it's not our us pushing or proding or pulling or it's not us trying to create something by by Strife or by effort or by whatever amen that's all human that's not going to work amen but it's just a yielding ourselves it's just a surrender what God already ordained God has already placed it in you and he's already brought it forth in this age and you didn't have anything to do with that seed getting in your soul and you didn't have anything to do with the word coming forth in this age so what do you think that you're going to do now to make it do something amen it's not your effort all you can do is say beat unto me according to Thy word all you can do is surrender to it and let those two omnipotents come together amen listen it's beyond you it's beyond your thinking it's beyond your efforts it's beyond your desire it's beyond anything that's in you as a human being it's so much deeper than your human realm it's the part that was intended to be you from the beginning it's the thought of God that's coming into manifestation in this season it's not you it's him in you so now all human efforts is just it's just a failure to begin with oh my so we don't try brother oh my I hope you know me better than that by now amen we should give our whole heart to it we should give our whole life to it we should give us surrender we should give all obedience but we're never going to make anything happen amen just by our own will and by Our Own Strength amen it's got to be something he has ordained before the foundation of the world and when he brings those two pieces together and then all of a sudden click it unlocks a power we know that there's a life in this word that's right the word has life it's a gerz word it already has life in it is that true yeah when the seed sewer went forth all the seed in his bag already had life in it it was gerti seed good seed it all had life in it but it didn't all come to life it only came to life in the good ground this message is good seed it's good seed it has life in it it has eternal life in it it is Christ this message is Christ it is the Original Seed this message has life in it it is life it is the lifegiver amen but you can cast it all over the place and no matter how much life it has it'll never spring forth to life and manifest until it falls in good ground too omnipotent Ence have to come together two parts of God have to be linked together that's the way God set this thing up in the beginning that's the way it always works he showed it all the way in the Garden of Eden because Adam could never reproduce himself without a bride he was going to take two parts of Adam and two parts of Adam uniting back together is going to produce life amen so two parts of God two parts of the word coming back together is going to manifest life amen you can't force feed you can't make somebody a Believer you can't do anything amen and neither can you say oh if I polish the seed and I get it listen The seed's Good Seed it doesn't need you to do anything to it you don't have to polish it up you don't have to soften it up you don't have to do any the seed is perfectly good and has perfect life in it and it doesn't matter you can preach it and preach it and preach it and preach it and see no manifestation there's nothing wrong with the message nothing wrong with the word the life is still in the word the problem in the soil amen because as soon as that seed hits the right soil it Springs to life you can't manufacture it you can't manipulate it nothing you do will work nothing of your human effort will work praise God brother B said in the message on the wings of a snow white dove in 1965 said like the Chinese Laundry used to do the here he would write he couldn't write English so he wrote on there and tore a piece of paper and handed you apart and you remember the Chinese laundries when they used to do that their two ends had to compare to get your clothes you couldn't fool him cuz he had the other end of it you might recopy your name but you can't ret that paper so it had to be the same piece of paper listen brother Bam's parables are so simple and he speaks in Parables that so that seeing they won't see and hearing they won't hear but blessed are your eyes for they see and they hear you go to the and takes a piece of paper he takes that piece of paper and he tears it a certain way he gives you one copy and he keeps one copy then he washes your clothes and for you to come back and to redeem your clothes for Redemption you have to have the half that matches his half and you can't you can't get another piece of paper it has to be the same piece of paper it's got to be the original yeah right that's he goes on to say so that's the way they done it in the Oriental days or long ago in eastern days they'd kill an animal stand between it tear the pieces of goat skin apart one took one and when the Covenant was confirmed they brought the pieces together and they had to dovetail just exactly now what God is showing him here is this on these sacrifices is speaking of Christ that how God took Jesus to Calvary and tore him apart and received the body up into heaven and sent the spirit down to us that same Spirit was on him as to be on you to dovetail with the body to be the bride at the end time see that's right don't be a denomination now it'll be the word what he was but like the word has to come to word like cell to human cell cuz your body's being built it isn't one cell of a human next of a dog next of a pig no it's all human cell that's the way the body of Christ is all word of God word coming to word and then word building upon word and so now amen he he he tore Jesus Christ amen at Calvary and now he sent down his spirit amen but the the spirit amen is in the word is that what he said the spirit is in the word and the spirit is lifegiver to the word and it's the life of the word and now he's come down here and we're we are carrying around one half of this ticket we didn't know it we had no idea we didn't know we were redeemable we didn't know anything amen oh we're carrying around one half of this ticket amen but there's a matching piece to this ticket amen and nothing else will substitute and you can't change it out you can't exchange it you can't get a new one you can't recreate it it's already there it has to be an original tore off piece tore off of the original we're walking around with a tore off piece and one day we had to come in contact with Christ is that right and Christ is the anointed word that's why brother said this message is Christ it's the word for today it's the anointed word of the hour it's the message of the hour and when you came in contact with the message of the hour all of the sudden they dovetailed what was in you and this message clicked bang and that's Redemption amen that is our Redemption that's what redeemed us that's what pulled us out of the myy clay that's what opened our eyes amen that's what you reunited us with God Amen that's what saved us all of these things happened why because I was walking around with a tick and I didn't know I didn't know I had half a golden ticket in me amen amen I had a ticket to Heaven I had a ticket to Redemption I had a ticket to everything Adam lost I had half of a ticket inside of me I had a ticket to Christ and a ticket to heaven and a ticket to eternal life but I didn't have all of it myself I couldn't get there on my own I had to come in contact with somebody who was the other ticket holder amen and these two tickets come together and when the tickets come together I had the admission slip to heaven and eternal life and Redemption back to God and everything that I had lost and the fall it all came back amen and what was the other half of the ticket it was Christ himself the word alive today that was the other half of that ticket praise God when two omnipotents meet then the power of the word is Unleashed brother BM says I've got this quot qu here from 1965 where he says by one spirit Spirit of God which is the lifegiver to the word the seed to vindicate that seed for That season he is the lifegiver I'd like for you to turn with me to Luke Chapter or yeah no let's go to Isaiah first let's go to Isaiah chapter 7 Isaiah 7:14 Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel let's go over to Luke chapter 1 The Book of Luke let's go to chapter one in Luke chapter 1 let's go to verse 28 let's go to verse 26 verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in into her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women when we read Isaiah 7 when Isaiah gave this prophecy I think it was about 700 years or something like that before we we see in the the the the events that are transpiring in Luke that seed went for it was written down it was put in a scroll it was read for hundreds of years by priests and it was read by other Scholars and scribes amen and that word had life in it that word was full of life it had life in it it was a gerti seed but brother Brenham said that that that word that was spoken by Isaiah was going around and around the earth for 700 years it was in motion and what was it doing it was waiting for good ground it was waiting for a resting place it was waiting for the predestinated place for it to land it had it was alive it was Living Word it had life in it it had the power in it of transformation it had the power within it to bring itself to pass it had everything it needed there was only one thing it was lacking it had to have good ground to fall in so that that word could bring forth the life that was in the word and verse 700 years it's moving around the earth and around the earth waiting for what waiting for the predestinated plan of God we think oh what a shame that word doesn't have a landing place there's nobody good enough nobody's worked themselves into that position nobody's uh remained a virgin nobody is a holy enough has nothing to do with any human effort God knew exactly amen before the foundation of the world what day that little virgin would be there and when she would be going to the well and he knew exactly what Gabriel would say to her on that day because she was good ground amen and that that that prophecy is moving around and around amen and he says to her hell there highly favored of the lord well she had no idea and he begins to express to her what her role is in Redemption begins to tell her her place in the scriptures and what scriptures she's supposed to be manifesting at that day and she listen she's the PRI destinated ground to bring forth this seed this seed is the prophecy of God that has life in it amen and it's got the it's got the ability to produce itself right okay we we agree she is the predestinated Virgin that was spoke of in Isaiah amen when God said when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive God already knew it was Mary amen but guess what she could do nothing on her own she couldn't produce the prophecy she couldn't produce Emanuel she couldn't do anything and guess what the seed of the word the prophecy couldn't do anything on its own but there had to be two parts that come together amen and when the two things come together bam two omnipotence come together two parts of the word come together two parts of God connected amen from the mind of God now in manifested Earth and all of a sudden when what what when these when these two parts came together when she received the word for her Day from a messenger that messenger said this is the prophecy this is the time and you're the one she said be it unto me according to Thy word and when she surrendered to that word that word fell in good ground amen and she asked how will these things be seeing I know no man and he says the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you why cuz the Holy Ghost is lifegiver to the seed Amen lifegiver to the word and all of a sudden that word was received and now it come alive inside of her amen you could go to the temple the next day you could go to the to the synagogue on the Sabbath on the Saturday worship and you could walk in there and all of a sudden she could maybe let's just say she went to church the next day let's just say and she's sitting here and all of a sudden the priest unrolls the scr let's just say he unrolled Isaiah and he goes to Isaiah and he reads the Lord has said a virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son and he shall be called Emanuel he said a virgin shall conceive and he can point to it and somebody can say where was that where is that again oh it's right here see the scroll he could hold it up and he could say right here read it this is the word a virgin shall conceive and she could say uh-uh yeah it's not there it's here amen it's not on print anymore it's not it's not just on a parchment anymore it's not just on animal skin anymore but that prophecy found its good ground amen we're not pointing to a piece of paper saying there it is there's the word there's the word there's the word and listen we live in the day where we're not pointing to a Bible say there's the word there's the word there's the word but by the grace of God there's seeds that has fallen in good ground and the word is springing to life right here amen right in this vessel right in the bride worldwide what's happening there's been prophecies that have been circling the globe circling the globe they've got life in them they've got the power to produce their own life to produce the life that's in the seed but it not doing anything until the right season and the right ground and when the good ground comes it falls into the good ground and all of a sudden now it comes to life praise godone now it wasn't on paper anymore now it was in Mary there's prophecies in the Bible but they're not on paper anymore friends and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says God became from God to become me to take my sin upon him that he might make me him what is he the anointed word for the day amen he became me he took my sin he became he took my place as Sin he took my place as a sinner and he went to Calvary for me so that he could make me him the anointed word for today he he that he might make me him amen make back to his great purpose as Sons and Daughters of God for he is the Eternal Father the attribute was in him see so that had to be displayed now see the whole three for purpose see to express himself what does God want to do with his word he wants to express himself where does he want to express himself he has always expressed himself in the good ground amen when the seed of the word dropped into the good ground it reproduced the life that was in the seed and that's always been Christ on display that's been God manifesting hisself in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says first to express himself completely God in Christ this is the three-fold purpose of of God the the one great plan God he unfolded in three folds first was to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence by his church in his church which is his body the bride so he could have preeminence to express himself through them so what's the bride here to do Express himself he wants to express himself through them he wants to manifest the life of the word in US am there's some prophecies that are laying here for this day let's turn to Ephesians 5 together I just want to turn to a few scriptures and read those as we wind down and finish here Ephesian excuse me Ephesians chapter 5 Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself so for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish that prophecy has been circling amen that he's going to have a church that he's going to wash with the washing of the Water by the word and that he is going to present himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that should be holy and without blemish amen what word what word is going to wash going to be the word by which he washes a bride to make her spotless and without blemish it's this end time message it's the restored word it's the perfect word that's been restored through a prophetic Ministry this is the age that this water has come forth in its Purity Amen to wash her so when is he going to present himself a spotless bride he's going to present himself a spotless bride when this water is doing the washing and we're living in this day amen amen let's look back at chapter 4 in verse 12 chapter 4 one chapter previous chapter 4:12 for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ there is a prophecy laying here that God has sent gifts and those gifts are to preach a word and that word is to work through those gifts amen until it brings a church into Perfection into the stature of the fullness of Christ amen and that is taking place this day that day is this day that prophecy's been rolling around and around and around but now the fullness of the word has come to bring this prophecy to pass and it's taking place all around us day by day what's he doing he's bringing us into the full stature of Christ until she be so much like him she will be him that's the fullness of the stature of Christ that's what's taking place today let's go to Revelation 19 Revelation 19 Revelation 19 and7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife ha made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be array in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints that prophecy has found a landing place there is a bride that is clothed in the white linens of the word she is being dressed in the word the prophet was here to bring the wedding garment and bring it to us Amen to clothe a bride for Christ and as we yield to that word we're putting the wedding garment on Amen and she's being prepared and the and the marriage of the L lamb has come the marriage is taking place now amen I'm not pointing to a prophecy there's a prophecy living in me not pointing to a word there's a word living in me and just as Mary she came to the word listen Mary came to the word the word came to her the word comes to the word when when Isaiah 7 said a virgin shall conceive that's the word Mary was going to be the Fulfillment of that part that said a virgin she was a virgin she was the word and she's going to receive amen the life of God within her amen and bring forth Christ bring forth a son bring forth Emanuel amen and she was that vessel she was that good ground but listen the first thing she had to do was recognize that today is the day for the prophecy I am the place of the prophecy and I believe what this messenger saying and then she had to surrender to it and say be it unto me according to Thy word and when she did the Holy Ghost overshadowed her and she conceived the word but the rest of the prophecy was she shall bring forth the son so now the word was working in her to finish the prophecy she was the good ground but that seed fell in that good ground and when it fell into the good ground she was the Virgin but the Virgin had to produce a son and that son had to be Emanuel god with us and so now the seed starts a process inside of her of growing and growing for nine months go to 10 months comes the delivery day and now what does she do she produces the fruit of that that word when Christ is born Amen in these prophecies we know where the landing place is we know that the hour is we know it's time for all of these some of these prophecies are still in process he's still bringing us to the fullness of Christ we're still coming into His Image we're still growing into all things the head he's still washing us with the water of the word we're still being clothed in the Garment we're still in the marriage ceremony we're still in the union with Christ we haven't yet gone to the marriage supper some of these prophecies are still in process amen but though they were in process Mary still know who she was where the word was what life was in her and that life was producing itself and that's where we are these prophecies aren't rolling around waiting to find a place they found a place by the grace of God and by the grace of God he prepared a soil and by the grace of God I believe I'm part of that and now I just need that word that I've received to do the work that the the life is in the word it has its own life it has its own transforming power it has the power to reproduce itself when it gets in the right soil and I believe by God's grace it's getting into the right soil and now oh praise God let the sunlight shine let the water of the Spirit fall and let that life that's in the word reproduce itself in this good ground sometimes the seed is the person sometimes the seed is the scriptures but these two things have to come together to bring forth life so amazing the Bible uses these analogies and it's full of them gardening and farming and Seed sewing and harvest now we realize we're in the harvest season and the harvest season comes at the end of the growth stage and God when we go to the first Parable he SED seed into his field but that seed was going to come through a whole maturing process until he was ready to receive back the seed that he had planted as it goes through the process when it first falls in the ground that stage of that wheat plant responds to the season so when it first falls in the spring amen those first Springs rains that dampness and the cool nights and the warming up of the day it starts to break that seed and it starts to take root and then you see two little sprigs coming out what the seed is responding to the environment of the day to the season that it's in then as the rains continue to to to fall and it keeps getting warmer it grows a stock and it keeps growing and getting longer amen and then as the days become longer and the sunlight progresses and and the moisture starts to fade off then it goes into the tassel and then then the pollen comes out and it pollinates and and now the seed starts to Bud and it's always responding to the season that's in now listen amen now now we can think of this as the children of God as a whole but you also think of it as yourself amen amen but in the final stage the rain stops and the full power of the sun amen begins to beat on that seed and what's it doing it's making it it's prepping it it's making it right for Harvest brother Bram says in Christ is revealed in his own word he says the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get right red you can't pick up the message and you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you see making mature Christians see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of Christian for him to receive the wheat has got to get ripe where is this word where is this word that we've received where am I in the process where are the children of God in the process they're right at the end of harvest season and the full measure of the word has come the full light of the s n is shining and what is the full light doing in the Hot August sun when the moisture is not falling amen what's it doing it's baking all the greenness or immaturity out of the seed because in order for it to go through the Harvest process which means to be cut down taken to the threshing floor beat flailed fogged stomped on by oxen with a wiing fork tuck stuck under thrown into the air winds of persecution blowing across it falling back on more beating more tossing more all of that what is that that's the final stage of harvest and for that seed that part of the word amen to come to the Harvest it can't have any greenness in it because greenness makes it soft it makes it doy it's milky and if you take it through that process it'll crush it and break it and it'll fall apart we've come to the final stage the word has to come to full maturity and what happens in full maturity it firms up then everything else around it pulls away in the final stage there's separation why is there separation because that hot sun has to bake the greenness out that hot sun has to bring that seed to the final stage of maturity amen so that it can go to the Garner and and it's got to get that seed right or else it'll never make it through the final stage of harvest but guess what the shuck can't take it the stalk can't take it they flourished in their season but they can't take it in this season the only thing that can take it is the seed that's why the shut pulls away and falls out that's why everything turns brown and dead that's why there's no life anywhere else but there's life inside the seed amen but the but the the life inside the seed that seed has got to be able to carry that life all all the way into the Garner in order to carry that life into the Garner it's got to be prepared it's got to be I I hate to say it this way but it's got to be hardened it's got to be firmed up it's got to be able to take the pounding able to take the tribulation able to take the rejection able to take all of that it's got to be able to take it friends and I believe with all my heart we're in the final stage amen you see the way God is breaking the word to us amen you see the message that was preached last Wednesday amen about the pride of life and all the things in our life guess what the shuck can't take that kind of preaching cuz the shuck wants to be told you're a good boy and you're a good Christian and you're a bride and you're fine amen but the seed's got to get in Condition it's got to go through the next phase it can't be soft it can't be milky it is going to get crushed it's going to get broken amen when the World Council tightens up when all the World Turns the the the the the fury of the world begins to break loose amen you got to be firmed up and to be firmed up there's got to be a bright sunlight that'll root out all your immaturity and find out where it's laying and all of a sudden you lay there and all of a sudden it's like you're sucking and you know what's it doing it's sucking the moisture that's that makes it fat and plump and look nice and green the sun's got to suck all of that out the shuck says I can't take this I'm out of here amen the stalks trembling ready to turn loose of the seed because that seed's about ready to be snapped off the top thrown into a threshing floor trotten on with oxen tossed all around to take into the Garner why does it feel like we can't get away with anything why does it feel like I think something I'm just thinking it I didn't say anything I didn't do I just had this thought and all of a sudden God comes through the pull pit amen and through a human vessel has no idea he comes and he start to open up my thoughts and condemn all of my thinking and all of my feelings and all my selfishness and all of my pride and all that what's he doing the hot son of the word has come to a level it's trying to suck all the greenness out of the seed so it can go to the next stage why it's got life in it the life that he wants to draw back to himself we got to sit there and say it feels good suck the greenness suck the moisture you see as it's drying up it's not as pretty it's not as fat and plump and pretty it starts to dry and get brown down and it's pale there's no more milk in it there it's not juicy it's dry and our old life becomes nothing amen our outer self becomes nothing amen it becomes dry it becomes nothing special it becomes nothing that I want anymore it's got to be firmed up got to be hardened to go to the next stage I thank God that he knows this process he knew where to plant his seed he knows who his seed is on one hand I'm the plant I'm the wheat plant he's growing me all the way to harvest on the other hand I'm the ground that the that the word is growing through and it's coming all the way to harvest but either way it's the same process God's going to bring all of his prophecy to life he's going to bring forth fruit and he's going to bring that fruit to a harvest condition and he's going to return it back to himself and God knew what season to plant the seed and he knew what ground he would plant it in and for years we say I'm bride I'm bride I'm bride I'm bride and you know what we were right and I thank God for the faith to be able to say it that's a privilege but I think we're beginning to realize what it means to be bride what it means to be like Christ when Christ went through the final stages of redemption when he went to pay the price of redemption he lost self he lost dignity listen he was crucified naked friends he was stripped he was beat he was rejected he was mocked and made fun of he was spit upon he was hardened yeah he could go through it he didn't defend himself he didn't call the angels that were sitting on every tree to come and rescue him he went right through the will and word of God to manifest the full word of God and never defended himself never protected himself never promoted himself and he could have done all of it way better than you and I can do it amen but he left us an example and we wanted to be bride and we wanted to be just like him and we'll be so much like him in the end we will be him I think that that's absolutely the truth that's a prophecy that's come from a prophet that in this end time she will be so much like him she will be him she will be so much like him she won't defend herself protect herself she won't she won't even correct the errors when they bring false accusations he won't defend himself I think she's going to be so much like him she will be him when they threw Stones he didn't throw them back when when they punched he didn't punch back when they spit he didn't spit back he yielded and surrendered to the will of God and said be it unto me according to thy will and the word came to full manifestation in that good ground he was the seed and the seed was living in him I Believe by the grace of God we are the seed and the seed's been swn in us and the seeds coming to fruit in us but God's going to work his Harvest process and the light's going to shine guess what if there's any greenness it's going to come out it's going to come out if we're of the group that needs to be told we're special and we're perfect and we're lovely and everything's great about us brother B said we got to lay in the presence of the sun to bake all the immaturity out to bake all the greenness out so that we can finish the commission finish the work that he left for this day when two omnipotence come together there's power say I don't know that I can go through that brother Chad I don't know that I can endure oh yes you can you're predestinated to I don't know if I can ever get over this complex I don't know if I can ever be able to take somebody rejecting me I don't know if I can ever take somebody falsely accusing me you can and you will because we're growing into the stature of the fullness of Christ we're growing up into the head in all things to stand here in the Splendor of him don't worry he'll work on your complex he'll work on your needs he'll work on of that until we can get to the place where we can say all I want is that word to live in me praise God let's all Stand Together the word comes to the word to do what to manifest the word the word comes to the word to manifest the word I believe that we're part of it friends let that word have its work in me musicians if you come and brother Ben if you come let's bow our heads together friends dear Lord Jesus I'm so thankful so thankful Lord for the word that you've given us today lord it's not it's not the kind of word Lord that makes us run around the building and Shout but God inside I'm shouting I don't know what it is Lord but I'm rejoicing cuz I know it's true Lord I know the things that I could never do in myself you're doing them the power of the word is working Lord I know that the power of that word that you've sewn inside this ground it's producing its own life it's producing its own fruit it's it's coming forth and growing in the seasons oh God help me yield to it in a greater way help me surrender God I don't want to go on like I've been I don't want to go on with all my problems and all my issues and I I don't want to hinder I don't want to hold back I don't want any of that God what I truly want from the bottom of my heart is I want to lay in the presence of this son and let this word bake all the greenness out of my life I want to be Harvest ready I want to be a mature seed I want to come to the finish line and I want that word that you've sown in me to produce its own life and be ready for the Harvest help me to yield to it Lord God I'm excited Lord I I look at myself in the mirror and I'm troubled but I look at the word and I get excited because everything you promised has to happen Lord everything you said would be here in the end time it'll be here in the end time everything your Prophet preached about the bride she will absolutely manifest it'll not miss one word it will not miss one iota the character that you had is the character that we will have the selflessness you had is the selflessness we will have I don't know how you'll do it I can't produce it but I know know that this word that you've sown for this day it'll produce it Lord for the power of transformation is in the seed God I pray that you'd help us to yield surrender and rejoice oh just as Mary Mary could have never made herself part of the word you predestinated that for her and she could never produce the word all she could do was receive the word word and that was by Grace but when she received the word your word produced itself in her God we can't make ourselves part of the word but by Grace We believe We Are amen and God we have no power in ourselves to produce your word but oh God the word that we have received in this end time it has the power to produce its own life and I believe it Lord I just want to yield to you and surrender to that word and receive it and let it do its work and I don't want to be ashamed of it I don't want to make excuses I just want to yield and surrender and open myself and let your word do its wonderful work for I believe the word has come to the word but you sent a good word youve prepared good ground so that you could reproduce yourself in this day your life your character your manifestations God I pray that you get more of the greenness out of my life the sun that's drawing me to you is drawing the maturity out of me God continue that work I can't do it myself I can't fix myself I can't mature myself I can't do it Lord I've tried to do better I've tried to stop thinking acting reacting and I failed every time but God I'm acknowledging that I need more of that light I need more time in the sunlight Let It Shine On Me brighter than it's ever shine bring a bring your raise of the power of your word brighter and and and sharper and more powerful with more heat than there's ever been Lord so that I can finish the maturing process I want to be gathered to your Garner Lord I surrender to you and thank you God for your word bless us help us grow us mat assure us have your way in US Lord as we surrender to you God your Prophet said when two omnipotence meat it's the power to produce the word God I believe that within this vessel two omnipotence have met let it manifest the power that's in the word the power to change a life the power to be conformed into the image of Jesus Christ the power of the stature of a perfect man let that power be released when these two omnipotents keep coming together I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you all brother Ben I'm just laying
