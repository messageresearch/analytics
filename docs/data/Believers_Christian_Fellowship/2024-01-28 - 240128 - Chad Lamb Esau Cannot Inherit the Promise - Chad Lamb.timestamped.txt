[12:53] pray
[12:55] amen amen God bless you all this morning
[12:58] sir certainly good to be here together
[13:01] amen let's look in Genesis chapter
[13:06] 25 Genesis CH 25 verse 19 God bless you
[13:10] Sister Joyce it's good to see you I
[13:12] didn't know if you were a visitor if you
[13:14] belonged here or what you've been gone a
[13:16] long time but God bless you it's good to
[13:17] have you here
[13:20] amen uh Genesis
[13:24] 25 verse
[13:27] 19
[13:29] and these are the generations of Isaac
[13:31] Abraham's son Abraham begat Isaac and
[13:33] Isaac was 40 years old when he took
[13:35] Rebecca to wife the daughter of Bethel
[13:37] the Syrian of padanaram the sister deben
[13:40] the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord
[13:43] for his wife because she was Barren and
[13:45] the Lord was intreated of him and
[13:47] Rebecca his wife conceived and the
[13:49] children struggled together within her
[13:51] and she said if it be so why am I thus
[13:55] and she went to inquire of the Lord and
[13:57] the Lord said unto her two nations are
[13:59] in thy womb and two manner of people
[14:01] shall be separated from thy bowels and
[14:03] the one people shall be stronger than
[14:04] the other people and the Elder Shall
[14:07] Serve the younger amen God bless you as
[14:10] you're
[14:11] seated keep your places open in the
[14:13] Bible there uh God bless you brother
[14:16] Carson and sister Sharon good to see you
[14:17] guys here again praise the Lord I saw a
[14:19] few visitors God bless you all we're
[14:21] very welcome to be here with us amen God
[14:24] has been very very good to us amen I
[14:27] certainly enjoyed the tape Wednesday
[14:28] night it did me a world of good to hear
[14:30] Brother Brenham give his life story
[14:33] again and it just does something to me
[14:35] to hear that voice and to hear how God
[14:39] you know took care of his son in order
[14:42] to take care of this sonen and it does
[14:44] me a world of good and I say God help us
[14:47] to be surrendered in a greater way so
[14:50] you can do your purpose do you remember
[14:52] last Sunday we talked about the the the
[14:54] title of the sermon was the twin within
[14:57] we were talking about the the these two
[15:00] uh twins that were in the womb of
[15:02] Rebecca she she she wanted to conceive
[15:06] she was uh Desiring to conceive and when
[15:09] she did uh her husband inquired the Lord
[15:12] for her and and the Lord was entreated
[15:15] uh on her behalf and she conceived but
[15:18] then she said if it's thus why am I in
[15:20] such turmoil if this is a good thing why
[15:22] am I so why is it why am I so torn apart
[15:26] on the inside and she inquired of the
[15:28] Lord and the Lord answered her he says
[15:30] because there's two nations in thy wound
[15:31] and there's two peoples in thy wound and
[15:33] if you remember as we begin to talk
[15:35] about that we begin to see that in US is
[15:38] two persons amen amen and we we we went
[15:41] through the message we're going to
[15:42] rehearse some of that but this morning
[15:44] i' I'd like to uh take a subject on Esau
[15:46] cannot inherit the promise Esau cannot
[15:50] inherit the promise and we want to bring
[15:52] this home it's always got to come home
[15:54] if it's ever going to do us any good
[15:55] it's got to come
[15:57] personal and so so we see now that from
[16:01] her would come these two Nations within
[16:04] her was two Nations and two peoples and
[16:06] they were at War and within her was a
[16:08] struggle between these two and brother B
[16:11] said this is a dying spirit and a dying
[16:13] body but now you can't be in two bodies
[16:16] at one time but there can be two Natures
[16:18] in you at one time now the nature of the
[16:20] spirit of the Lord when you're born
[16:21] again you're not born of the physical
[16:23] like the baby but what's happened the
[16:25] spiritual Birth has come to you so you
[16:27] can't be in two bodies ones but you can
[16:29] have two Natures in you you can have the
[16:30] old nature of the world but you can have
[16:32] the new Nature by the new birth right
[16:35] and so the this is just a few review
[16:37] quotes from last time he says these two
[16:40] boys if if we noticed their nature one
[16:42] of them was a spiritual man that was
[16:44] Jacob and the carnal man was Esau but
[16:47] they were both religious and that same
[16:50] thing has took place all down through
[16:51] the age the carnal and the spiritual
[16:54] Esau represents the man of the earth
[16:56] natural religious inclined but never
[16:58] able it wasn't in him to do it he
[17:00] couldn't do it he never was in him to be
[17:03] able to climb past the things of the
[17:05] world the carnal things but Jacob it was
[17:07] just so easy for him to do it and so now
[17:11] remember we're not we're not talking
[17:13] about two people out here we're talking
[17:16] about two people right here so keep that
[17:18] in mind the whole time we're talking and
[17:20] don't ever put it anywhere else in fact
[17:22] the more that I study this and the more
[17:24] that I look at this I realize that I
[17:26] don't have any problems with any anybody
[17:28] in the world there's only one problem I
[17:30] have and the problem is right
[17:33] here this is the biggest problem I have
[17:36] to deal with and in fact I am so
[17:39] consumed now with the problem that I
[17:41] have I'm not I mean I I really don't
[17:44] have any time to worry about anybody
[17:46] else amen and so this whole attitude of
[17:49] criticizing others and watching others
[17:51] it's just a distraction technique of the
[17:52] devil he can get you pointing out flaws
[17:54] and everybody else and while you're
[17:56] doing that you're not seeing the biggest
[17:58] flaw you're you're the one with the you
[18:00] know looking at the splinters in
[18:02] people's eyes with the beam sticking out
[18:04] of yours that Jesus was talking about
[18:06] amen and and it becomes foolish now when
[18:08] I look back over my life and I realize
[18:10] how childish how foolish how deceived
[18:13] I've been most of my life trying to find
[18:15] fault everywhere else and make sure I
[18:17] avoided fault everywhere else you know I
[18:20] don't want to be deceived and I don't
[18:22] want to I don't want to be you know I
[18:24] don't want to intermingle here cuz I
[18:25] don't want to be deceived and I don't
[18:26] want to go there and I don't want to
[18:28] talk to that one and and the deception
[18:31] was working right in my own
[18:34] head the voice of deception was going on
[18:37] right inside of me
[18:40] amen so we realize that that Esau is a
[18:44] type of the natural man and and the
[18:47] carnal the earthy and Jacob the
[18:49] spiritual and Esau could never step into
[18:52] the spiritual Realms no matter how much
[18:54] he wanted to he could never do it but
[18:56] Jacob it was just so easy and you
[18:58] realized that Jacob wasn't always
[19:01] good hope we understand that Jacob
[19:03] wasn't always good amen but Jacob that
[19:06] he could just step into the spiritual
[19:08] when he went to bethl all he did was lay
[19:10] his head on a rock and the heavens open
[19:12] and he saw a ladder he wasn't pressing
[19:14] he wasn't trying it just happened to him
[19:16] because that that's his nature that was
[19:18] his seed he was predestinated for that
[19:20] purpose if we go over to Romans let's
[19:23] turn to Romans chapter
[19:27] n
[19:38] Romans chapter
[19:45] 9:6 and in Romans chapter 9 beginning at
[19:48] verse 6 say not as though the word of
[19:50] God ha taken n effect for they are not
[19:52] all Israel which are of Israel neither
[19:54] because they are the Seed of Abraham are
[19:56] they all children but in Isaac shall thy
[19:58] seed be called that is they which are
[20:00] the children of the flesh these are not
[20:02] the children of God but the children of
[20:04] Promise are counted for the seed for
[20:07] This Is The Word of Promise at this time
[20:08] will I come and Sarah shall have a son
[20:10] and not only this but when Rebecca also
[20:13] conceived by one even by Our Father
[20:15] Isaac for the children being not yet
[20:17] born neither having done any good or
[20:19] evil that the purpose of God according
[20:21] to election might stand not of works but
[20:23] of him that calleth it was said unto her
[20:25] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[20:27] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[20:30] have I hated so I wanted to draw out of
[20:33] here in verse um eight that is they
[20:37] which are the children of the flesh they
[20:39] are not the children of God anden we
[20:41] realize that this flesh has to be
[20:44] changed right this flesh is not
[20:47] inheriting the promise until it's
[20:50] changed right this old this old nature
[20:54] amen this old human spirit will One Day
[20:56] Fly Away and be no more amen it's the
[20:59] it's the seed of promise that was on the
[21:01] inside that comes by the that comes to
[21:03] life by the new birth that's the one
[21:05] that inherits the promise will I have a
[21:07] body of Flesh absolutely but it's not
[21:10] going to be this one it's going to be
[21:11] this one
[21:12] changed this one doesn't inherit the
[21:15] promise praise God in the message
[21:18] communion brother B says I was saying
[21:20] this taking for myself like you was
[21:22] going to say William brandham well 40
[21:24] years ago the William brandham it isn't
[21:26] the same one tonight if somebody back
[21:29] there would say William brandham he was
[21:30] a rank Rascal see because I was born of
[21:32] Charles and Ella Branham in their nature
[21:35] I was a siner I come to the world a liar
[21:37] and all the habits of the world laid
[21:39] right in me but down in there too was
[21:41] another nature prescy predestinated was
[21:45] in there by God in this same body see
[21:48] two Natures in there well I only catered
[21:51] to one as it growed I grewed as a baby d
[21:53] d first thing you know I became a liar
[21:55] became everything else that's a sinner
[21:57] because I I was raised up that way but
[21:59] down in there was a little speck of Life
[22:01] all the time further down he says what
[22:04] it was it there was another William
[22:06] brandham see a little spot of eternal
[22:08] life down there from the genes of God
[22:10] the word of God that was placed in there
[22:14] praise be to God I'm so glad that God
[22:16] prayed something else down inside of
[22:19] me and I realized that Esau or the Esau
[22:23] nature doesn't inherit the promise but
[22:25] it's the spiritual seed that inherits
[22:27] it's the seed of promise that will will
[22:30] make the inheritance amen and when we
[22:33] were
[22:34] reading when we were reading back in
[22:37] Genesis 25 amen when she was wondering
[22:40] what this turmoil was going on inside
[22:42] her why she was being torn apart amen he
[22:46] he said there's two peoples and there's
[22:47] two Nations inside of you and the one
[22:50] shall be stronger than the other amen
[22:52] but the Elder Shall Serve the younger
[22:55] and we realize when we got to this part
[22:57] and uh last week we begin to realize
[22:59] that what came first was my natural
[23:01] birth amen but what came second was my
[23:04] spiritual birth but praise God there's a
[23:06] promise that the Elder Shall Serve the
[23:08] younger that I do not have to serve this
[23:11] body I'm no longer subject to sin I'm no
[23:14] longer enslaved to the flesh amen but
[23:17] now there's another life inside by the
[23:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost that will take
[23:22] control of this outer man amen and the
[23:25] the Elder the natural birth will become
[23:27] subject to the New
[23:29] Birth oh I believe it I believe that's
[23:31] still true today amen that the the the
[23:34] the the uh first born the natural birth
[23:38] the natural man will become subject to
[23:40] the spiritual man to the new birth and I
[23:42] thank God for
[23:44] that
[23:46] amen now let's go back to Genesis
[23:56] 25
[24:01] Genesis
[24:04] 25 and verse
[24:13] 24 in Genesis 25: 24 it says and when
[24:16] her days to be delivered were fulfilled
[24:18] behold there were twins in her womb and
[24:20] the first came out red all over like a
[24:23] hairy garment and they called his name
[24:24] Esau and after that came his brother out
[24:27] and his hand took hold on Esau's heel
[24:29] and his name was called Jacob and Isaac
[24:32] was three score years old when she bar
[24:34] them and the boys grew and Esau was a
[24:37] cunning Hunter a man of the field and
[24:39] Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
[24:43] and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat
[24:45] of his venison but Rebecca loved
[24:48] Jacob man brother B tells us a lot about
[24:51] Esau and Jacob and he he has a lot to
[24:53] say in one of the places he says and we
[24:55] see that this is a mixed multitude the
[24:57] two two sons of Isaac and Rebecca
[24:59] represent the world over every time
[25:01] there's a Revival there's twins born
[25:03] every time we have a Revival twins are
[25:05] born Esau and Jacob were twins one of
[25:08] them was a man after the world the other
[25:09] was spiritual now Esau was just a good a
[25:12] man as Jacob was if you looked at him he
[25:15] liked to take care of his old blind
[25:17] Father which was a prophet he was a good
[25:19] boyn morally I guess all right and he
[25:21] helped worked and perhaps Jacob was just
[25:24] a mama's boy hung around mama and just
[25:26] we called a little sister and so Esau
[25:28] was was loved a man of the world
[25:30] naturally never cared nothing about the
[25:34] birthright and we see that in brother
[25:37] and over and over in many places says
[25:39] Esau was the better
[25:41] man and Jacob was the little Shyer and
[25:44] he was the one pulling tricks and and
[25:47] Jacob was the was the better man and he
[25:49] was better to his daddy and he worked
[25:51] and he did things and and Jacob he said
[25:53] hung around his mom was a mama's boy and
[25:55] that's the title every boy's ever wanted
[25:57] you to be a mama's boy and a big
[26:01] but but we see the the way man views
[26:04] things and the way we see things in the
[26:06] natural is not the way God views
[26:08] it and sometimes the Deception comes in
[26:12] because Esau was a good
[26:15] man Esau wasn't evil in the way we would
[26:18] think evil he wasn't Wicked in the way
[26:20] we would think Wicked amen but he was a
[26:23] good man he was a good son he was good
[26:25] to his parents he was good to his father
[26:27] he he hung around and helped out D and
[26:30] and and you could look in the naturals
[26:32] brother B said he was a he was a much
[26:34] better man than than Jacob but that's
[26:37] not what God was looking at because when
[26:39] it came down to the rubber meets the
[26:41] road Jacob was willing to give up the
[26:43] birth right or Esau was willing to give
[26:45] up the birthright but that's all that
[26:47] Jacob desired and God was looking at
[26:49] something deeper amen than just how nice
[26:53] and how friendly and how personable a
[26:56] person was God can absolutely change all
[26:59] of those things and he did change it in
[27:01] Jacob Jacob underwent a transformation
[27:03] when he wrestled with the angel and that
[27:05] transformation affected him the rest of
[27:06] his life God can deal with that amen but
[27:10] but what God can't deal with is somebody
[27:12] that doesn't have a desire to the
[27:13] birthright that doesn't value the word
[27:16] that doesn't want the word above
[27:17] everything else amen so God was looking
[27:19] different than man man would look and
[27:21] say Esau's the good boy he's the better
[27:23] one Jacob he's a little bit this and
[27:25] Esau he's all like that and we can make
[27:28] our designation amen and the problem
[27:30] sometimes in our flesh is if we've been
[27:32] given a good disposition and we're kind
[27:34] and we've been trained with manners and
[27:36] we're nice we're genuinely nice and
[27:38] friendly and have friends and do good
[27:40] deeds we can mistake that for being
[27:44] spiritual and it's a mistake we can make
[27:46] especially growing up Amen in a good
[27:49] home and growing up in the right
[27:50] atmosphere we can make the mistake that
[27:52] being spiritual is equal to being
[27:56] nice but being being nice is not equal
[27:58] to being spiritual the world is full of
[28:00] nice
[28:02] people remember when brother brandom
[28:04] compared the kind old priest with with
[28:06] Jesus
[28:08] Christ amen the kind old priest who when
[28:12] you were without money and dad was sick
[28:14] and without work he come and gave you
[28:15] some money the kind old priest that was
[28:17] there to dedicate you at eight days old
[28:20] and the kind old priest that married
[28:21] your mom and dad and and and you never
[28:24] heard him raise his voice but here goes
[28:26] Jesus like a mad man running through the
[28:27] temple throwing over the money changers
[28:29] tables and whipping them on the back
[28:31] with a with a cord whip that he made
[28:33] himself when you just look at that in
[28:35] the natural I mean who looks the most
[28:38] spiritual but one was a fulfillment of
[28:40] the word amen and the other one was
[28:42] denying the
[28:45] word so even in ourselves sometimes we
[28:48] can become deceived because remember
[28:50] Esau and Jacob were both
[28:54] religious and we're born
[28:56] religious we don't become religious amen
[28:59] that's embeded that's that's built into
[29:01] the the human
[29:03] nature and so it's going to take more
[29:05] than just being nice and having a nice
[29:07] disposition and treating people nice now
[29:10] I'm not saying that Christians shouldn't
[29:11] treat people nice and have a nice
[29:13] disposition absolutely we need to be
[29:15] changed we need to be molded into the
[29:17] image of Jesus Christ but you can't just
[29:20] leave it at that natural carnal level
[29:22] there's something that's much deeper
[29:24] that's
[29:26] important if we look at verse 29 here in
[29:30] Genesis
[29:31] 25 go to verse
[29:35] 29 and Jacob saw pottage and Esau came
[29:39] from the field and he was faint and Esau
[29:43] said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with
[29:45] that same red pottage for I'm faint
[29:48] therefore was his name called Edom and
[29:51] Jacob said sell me uh Jacob and Jacob
[29:54] said sell me this day thy Birthright and
[29:58] Esau said behold I am at the point to
[30:00] die and what profit shall this
[30:02] Birthright do to me and Jacob said swear
[30:05] to me this
[30:07] day and he swore unto him and he sold
[30:09] his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob
[30:12] gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils
[30:14] and he did eat and drink and Rose up and
[30:16] went his way thus Esau despised his
[30:21] Birthright I I this terminology is so
[30:24] important to me because when you think
[30:26] Esau his Birthright you would think that
[30:29] Esau grew up all of his life thinking I
[30:32] hate being the first born I don't want
[30:34] nothing to do with the inheritance I
[30:36] don't want to collect everything that my
[30:38] dad has when he dies it wasn't that kind
[30:40] of despising the
[30:42] birthright but when it came down to it
[30:45] when it was his natural life or the
[30:47] birthright he was willing to give up the
[30:49] birthright to preserve his natural
[30:52] life and Jacob little Shyer that he was
[30:55] and mama's boy that he was there was one
[30:58] thing that was locked inside of his
[30:59] heart he had to have that Birthright cuz
[31:02] that Birthright links to the promise it
[31:04] links to the word it links to Abraham it
[31:06] links to everything else it's a link to
[31:08] Jesus Christ amen and so there was
[31:10] something in him moving him and I doubt
[31:13] he understood or comprehended what it
[31:15] all was but something in him had to have
[31:18] that word and had to have that new birth
[31:20] and had to have the baptism of the Holy
[31:22] Ghost and had to have the Assurance the
[31:24] birthright was the
[31:26] assurance amen and Jacob had to have it
[31:29] amen and he was willing to do whatever
[31:31] to have that Birthright and he was also
[31:33] willing to do whatever to have the
[31:35] blessing amen but Esau when it came down
[31:38] to his natural life or the birthright he
[31:41] took his natural life and he said what
[31:43] good is the birthright if I
[31:47] die it shows he didn't understand there
[31:50] was nothing in him to connect to the
[31:52] birthright amen because even if you die
[31:54] the birthright is still in effect right
[31:58] amen I would rather have this Birthright
[32:01] of the Holy Ghost this Birthright of the
[32:03] word of Christ I'd rather have this
[32:05] Birthright than anything else in life
[32:07] than my natural life then whatever
[32:09] because this is just a vapor this is
[32:10] just a Mist this isn't perfection this
[32:13] is not what I'm living for but that
[32:14] Birthright holds everything for
[32:17] me and so Jacob was moved inside that he
[32:21] had to have the birth right and he would
[32:23] get it by whatever means he had to get
[32:24] it if he made a fool out of himself if
[32:26] every he thought he was wrong whatever
[32:28] he had to have
[32:30] it but Esau so lightly gave it
[32:34] away and the Bible says he despised his
[32:39] Birthright he had no he didn't put the
[32:42] proper value on
[32:45] it and so the problem with
[32:48] Esau is he was
[32:51] natural carnal it could never break past
[32:54] the
[32:55] natural what good is this if I'm dead
[32:59] that seems logical but it's not true
[33:03] it's logical but it's not
[33:05] true in wisdom versus faith brother B
[33:08] says Jacob and Esau or Esau and Jacob
[33:10] was a perfect timee both of them
[33:12] religious both of them twins Esau was
[33:15] the ecclesiastical type he was a man
[33:17] that was smart had a good moral standing
[33:20] things like that but he didn't have no
[33:22] use for that Birthright Jacob didn't
[33:24] care what he had to do just so he got
[33:27] the
[33:30] birthright didn't didn't care what his
[33:32] friends thought of him didn't care what
[33:35] what anybody else thought of him he had
[33:37] to have this
[33:38] Birthright
[33:40] amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 12
[33:50] together I just want you to
[33:53] see I like for us to look together at
[33:56] how the Bible views things what God's
[33:59] Viewpoint is because when we still view
[34:01] things in a carnal way and we don't
[34:03] realize the we don't realize what a
[34:06] terrible thing this
[34:08] was and in Hebrews chapter
[34:11] 12 let's go to verse 14 Hebrews
[34:17] 12:14 says follow peace with all men and
[34:22] Holiness without which no man shall see
[34:24] the Lord looking diligently lest any man
[34:27] fail of the grace of God lest any root
[34:29] of bitterness springing up trouble you
[34:30] and thereby many be defiled lest there
[34:33] be any fornicator or profane person as
[34:37] Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his
[34:44] Birthright you know the Bible calls him
[34:47] a fornicator or a profane person the
[34:51] Bible says Esau was a profane
[34:55] person and you think the man was
[34:58] dying he was faint and ready to perish
[35:01] he was going to die uh what was so bad
[35:05] about giving his brother The Inheritance
[35:07] so that he could survive but the Bible
[35:10] the the book of Hebrews now is
[35:12] recognizing that he was a profane what
[35:15] made him profane because he was bad to
[35:17] his daddy because he went around
[35:18] stealing a bunch of stuff and murdering
[35:22] people what made him profane is he chose
[35:25] the natural things over the spiritual
[35:27] things that's what made him profane not
[35:31] evil Wicked but natural natural life
[35:34] natural existence natural substance over
[35:37] the spiritual
[35:39] things he goes on to say uh for there be
[35:43] any fornicator or profane person as Esau
[35:46] who for one morsal to meat sold his
[35:47] Birthright for you know that afterward
[35:49] when he would have inherited the
[35:51] blessing he was rejected for he found no
[35:54] place of repentance though he sought it
[35:55] carefully with tears years I've been
[35:57] through this with you before but I I
[35:59] want us to focus in on this because
[36:01] we're going to go down to the blessing
[36:02] now we looked at the we looked at the
[36:03] birthright we're going to go to the
[36:04] blessing and it says he was rejected
[36:09] uh is let's go back to verse 17 for we
[36:12] know that afterward when he would have
[36:13] inherited the blessing he was rejected
[36:16] for he found no place of repentance
[36:18] though he sought it carefully with tears
[36:21] now it didn't say that he
[36:24] repented said he found no place of
[36:27] repentance though he sought it with
[36:29] tears and immediately when we read these
[36:32] things we think How could somebody not
[36:34] repent if they're really sorry and if
[36:36] they're coming with tears and it looks
[36:38] like he's repenting but when we go back
[36:40] and read the story Esau was not
[36:42] repenting there was no repentance in him
[36:45] it says when he sought for repentance he
[36:47] he found no place of repentance though
[36:50] he sought it carefully with tears this
[36:52] wasn't his repentance he wasn't looking
[36:55] for repentance he was looking for his
[36:57] dad to repent because his dad had given
[36:59] the blessing already and he could find
[37:02] no place of repentance he could not
[37:04] change Jacob's he could not change
[37:06] Isaac's mind on the situation it was
[37:09] already fixed although he sought it with
[37:10] tears he himself was never repentant he
[37:13] himself was never sorry he himself was
[37:16] not apologizing or making it right he
[37:18] was asking Isaac to change and Isaac to
[37:21] repent let's go back and read it so we
[37:24] we have an understanding of what we're
[37:25] talking about Genesis
[37:35] 27 Genesis
[37:38] 27 now we know in the story of Genesis
[37:41] uh Rebecca comes to him and she finds
[37:44] out that that that uh uh Isaac is ready
[37:47] to bless Esau he told him to go out and
[37:50] get venison so I can bless you and and
[37:53] he goes hunting and and she comes up
[37:55] with this scheme where they they can
[37:56] deceive Isaac CU Isaac is now blind and
[37:59] and they they they she takes Jacob she
[38:01] puts the goat skins on him to make him
[38:03] hairy like his brother she cooks up the
[38:05] meat he takes it into his father he
[38:08] deceives his father and his father
[38:10] blesses him and he gets the blessing
[38:13] that was intended for Esau which which
[38:17] Isaac intended for Esau God always knew
[38:19] where it was going to
[38:21] land right so let's pick up the story
[38:25] here
[38:29] let's go
[38:30] to verse 35 let's read it in verse
[38:39] 35 now let's go to verse
[38:41] 34 and when Esau heard the word of words
[38:45] of his father he cried with a great
[38:46] exceeding bitter cry and he said unto
[38:48] his father bless me even me also oh my
[38:51] father and he said thy brother came with
[38:53] subtility and ha taken away thy blessing
[38:56] and he and he said is not he rightly
[38:57] named Jacob for he hath supplanted me
[39:00] these two times he took away my
[39:02] Birthright and behold now he ha taken
[39:04] away my blessing and he and he said hast
[39:07] thou not reserved a blessing for me and
[39:10] Isaac answered and said unto Esau behold
[39:12] I have made him thy Lord and all his
[39:15] Brethren have I given to him for
[39:16] servants and with corn and wine have I
[39:18] sustained him and what shall I do now
[39:21] unto thee my son and Esau said unto his
[39:24] father hast thou but one blessing my
[39:26] father bless me even me also oh my
[39:29] father and Esau lifted up his voice and
[39:34] wept what was he weeping for cuz he was
[39:38] sorry for giving up the birthright for
[39:40] he was no he was sorry cuz he missed out
[39:42] on a blessing this is not true
[39:44] repentance this is a carnal Christian
[39:46] the carnal Christian always wants the
[39:48] benefits amen and here's Esau he's sorry
[39:52] for himself he wants his dad he says is
[39:55] there not yet a re is there not yet a
[39:57] blessing for me he says I've already
[39:59] given him everything I've already given
[40:01] him everything and he says is there not
[40:03] yet do you not yet reserve a blessing
[40:05] for me and he lifted up his voice and
[40:07] wept this is no repentance for despising
[40:11] the birthright this is a man who's sorry
[40:13] because he didn't get
[40:15] something amen and both of these men are
[40:18] religious but we find out that both of
[40:21] these both of these men are in
[40:24] me there's one who wants all the benefit
[40:27] all the blessing all
[40:29] the it's the reality we want we come to
[40:33] God and we want God to heal us and give
[40:35] us money and give us jobs and give us
[40:37] all these and all the promises and all
[40:39] the blessings and all of that but the
[40:41] question is do you do do you desire the
[40:43] birthright more than anything else in
[40:45] your life and you desire the blessing
[40:47] you have to desire the birthright and
[40:49] the
[40:50] blessing Esau despised the birthright
[40:53] but he was weeping for the blessing how
[40:56] many Christians are despising the word
[40:59] but weeping for the
[41:01] blessing still wanting the blessing
[41:04] asking for a place of repentance he
[41:06] could find no place for Isaac to repent
[41:08] found no place even though he sought it
[41:09] with tears there was no tears over
[41:11] giving up the birth right there was no
[41:13] sorrow over giving up the birth right
[41:15] there was only sorrow over losing out on
[41:17] a blessing said God I do not want to be
[41:21] that kind of carnal believer amen I want
[41:23] the birthright to be everything to me I
[41:25] want the blessing too just like Jacob
[41:27] wanted the blessing I want them both
[41:30] amen but how can I have how can I have a
[41:32] desire for the blessing without a desire
[41:34] for the birth right that makes me a
[41:36] carnal
[41:39] believer
[41:41] amen you could say well yeah I've known
[41:45] a lot of carnal Believers in my day so
[41:47] have I there's one right
[41:50] here I've known one who's been a carnal
[41:53] believer and been crying out for the
[41:55] blessings and crying out and crying out
[41:57] and not realizing I was selfish cries
[42:00] with selfish motives with selfish ideas
[42:02] amen because I'd got my self exalted as
[42:05] the main purpose of my existence was so
[42:08] self could be comfortable self could be
[42:10] exalted self could have
[42:14] everything say God help
[42:17] us God help
[42:19] us I what what I do not like is when I'm
[42:23] preaching things like these and and I
[42:25] know it happens to all as we go down the
[42:26] line preaching you think I saw that
[42:28] before I've seen that before and over
[42:30] there and over there I mean all you got
[42:32] to do is look in the mirror if you've W
[42:33] ever see this before if
[42:35] you I've seen it before and I'm ashamed
[42:38] of
[42:39] it but I want the spiritual things I
[42:44] want the natural blessings too but I
[42:46] want the spiritual
[42:49] things
[42:51] amen when we come to the story of Cain
[42:54] and
[42:55] Abel all the way back in the beginning
[42:58] these two boys they come to a time where
[43:01] they're required to bring a worship It's
[43:03] Time To Worship the Lord and they're
[43:05] going to bring a sacrifice and we know
[43:08] the story super well but but we know
[43:10] that Cain brings of the fruit of the
[43:12] field and and he makes a pretty Altar
[43:14] and he does you know all the works of
[43:16] his hands he presents to the Lord and
[43:18] Abel he brings a lamb he brings blood
[43:21] and God has respect to Abel's offering
[43:23] but not to kain's and Cain was wroth and
[43:28] his countenance had fallen and the Lord
[43:30] comes to him and says why is thy
[43:33] countenance fallen and and all of these
[43:35] we we we know the whole story but then
[43:37] he he says just do as thy brother and
[43:39] it'll be well with thee God even gives
[43:41] him in Mercy all you have to do is just
[43:44] follow your brother's lead and it'll be
[43:45] well with thee so he goes out and talks
[43:48] to his brother and he has a conversation
[43:49] with Abel and after the conversation he
[43:52] slays Abel and brother bam says he
[43:54] slayed him because he was jealous of him
[43:55] cuz God had accepted him and didn't
[43:57] accept Cain because Cain Cain's whole
[44:00] religion was built around
[44:03] Cain Cain's whole religion was built
[44:06] about around what Cain wanted to offer
[44:08] what Cain thought was beautiful what
[44:09] Cain thought was acceptable and all the
[44:11] works of Cain's
[44:14] hands he was a carnal believer remember
[44:18] these are twins
[44:19] again but Abel didn't offer anything of
[44:23] himself he didn't offer his Works he
[44:25] didn't offer for his ideas he waited for
[44:28] Revelation and by spiritual Revelation
[44:29] he realized it was blood blood is what
[44:32] he's seeking and he takes a little lamb
[44:34] and he brings a little lamb up and he
[44:36] slays the lamb and Spills the blood and
[44:38] God accepts his offering and rejects
[44:40] Cain Cain's was put forth with effort
[44:42] with Beauty with with class with style
[44:44] with all of this stuff but God rejected
[44:46] it and accepted Abel's and that
[44:48] infuriated Cain cuz Cain was a carnal
[44:50] believer and couldn't understand how
[44:52] easily Abel could slip into the realm of
[44:55] Revelation catch something from God and
[44:57] know exactly what was the right offering
[44:59] without effort without work without
[45:01] striving without without planting and
[45:03] sewing and read without all the things
[45:05] that Cain had to do Cain put forth a
[45:08] tremendous amount of effort Abel put
[45:10] forth very little effort but it was just
[45:12] so easy for
[45:16] him and Cain hated
[45:19] him and Cain slew him but let's look at
[45:23] what the scripture says about that in
[45:25] first John
[45:36] in 1 John chapter
[45:44] 3 1 John chap 3 and verse
[45:50] 11 for this is the message that you've
[45:52] heard from the
[45:53] beginning that we should love one
[45:55] another another not as Cain who was of
[45:57] the wicked one and slew his brother and
[46:01] wherefore or why did he slay him what
[46:04] wherefore slew he him because his own
[46:07] Works were evil and his brothers
[46:12] righteous why did he slay him because
[46:14] his Works were evil what works not
[46:17] slaying we know slaying is evil he's
[46:19] talking about the works that he did
[46:21] before he slew his brother and what were
[46:24] the evil works that came did brought
[46:27] fruit to the Field built an
[46:30] altar
[46:34] God why were they Wicked because he did
[46:37] it all for
[46:38] himself he brother said he loved God he
[46:41] was religious he had a desire to worship
[46:43] God but he worshiped God according to
[46:45] his own understanding and according to
[46:46] his own dictates according to his own
[46:48] desire he was a carnal believer and his
[46:51] Works were considered
[46:54] Wicked Abel's Works were considered
[46:58] righteous because what did Abel do Abel
[47:00] offered according to Revelation am and
[47:03] he was considered
[47:04] righteous oh I want to live on the
[47:08] spiritual
[47:11] side Prophet says in the true Easter
[47:16] seal he says but in the Garden of Eden
[47:19] where they had only two boys the
[47:20] decision was forced upon man to make a
[47:23] decision anything is done to show his
[47:25] true color what he is to show what he is
[47:27] inside of him now we find that the that
[47:30] the time came between Cain and Abel that
[47:32] the decision had to be forced because
[47:35] that the time of worship had come and
[47:36] each boy had to provide a way to make a
[47:38] worship to God and if you'll
[47:41] notice between right and wrong there's
[47:44] just one little breath of difference and
[47:47] the wrong in the last days has been
[47:49] prophesied that it would be so close to
[47:51] the right that it would deceive the very
[47:52] elected if it was possible between right
[47:55] and wrong
[47:59] wrong the there's a hair's breath
[48:02] between right and
[48:03] wrong there's just a hairs breath
[48:07] between your old nature being religious
[48:12] serving God the best of your
[48:14] understanding the best of your ability
[48:15] and doing all you can to serve God Amen
[48:17] for the blessings and so you can make it
[48:19] to heaven so you can have everything
[48:21] that's promised there's just a hair's
[48:23] breath between that and serving him by
[48:25] revelation in actually catching what God
[48:27] wants and worshiping him in spirit and
[48:29] in
[48:30] truth just a hair's breath one is
[48:33] between the outside man and the inner
[48:35] man that's how close it
[48:38] is the outside man can't please God
[48:42] because he doesn't have faith it's only
[48:44] the inside man that can please God
[48:47] because he has faith and faith is a
[48:52] revelation brother B says now just watch
[48:54] how cunning that fellow is now he's just
[48:58] well they're just like Judas and Jesus
[49:00] they're both brothers in their tribe
[49:01] just like Esau and Jacob The Crow and
[49:03] the dove sitting on the same root and
[49:06] everything is a twin in this great
[49:08] Warfare that we're in everything is a
[49:11] twin praise
[49:13] God in uh the message a man running from
[49:17] the presence of the Lord he says you can
[49:19] see people today there is two spirits
[49:23] and one of them one of them is the Holy
[49:24] Spirit the other one is the Unholy
[49:26] Spirit and the one is governed by that
[49:28] and both of them religious now yeah
[49:30] that's the strange part they're both
[49:32] religious and just like Esau and Jacob
[49:34] was both religious like Cain and Abel
[49:36] was both religious like Judas and Jesus
[49:38] both religious both religious and we see
[49:41] it today both sides religious Esau was
[49:45] religious he was a profane person Cain
[49:48] was religious and his Works were
[49:51] Wicked I don't want to be just religious
[49:54] and carnal I want to be spirit
[49:56] spiritual I Want To Live From the Inside
[49:58] Man and I want the outside man become
[50:01] subject I want the Elder to serve the
[50:03] younger and I want I want the new birth
[50:05] to rule everything in my life and I want
[50:08] to be tipped off and recognized listen I
[50:11] I think this is what's so important and
[50:13] what's become so real to me I want to I
[50:15] want to go into a little Divergence here
[50:16] this is the subject I've been really
[50:18] wanting to get to today and I want to
[50:19] talk about preparation for a millennial
[50:21] Reign but when I want to realize I think
[50:24] we all it's healthy for us when we come
[50:26] to a realization that every thought that
[50:28] passes through my brain is not
[50:31] safe I think we'll be a lot better off
[50:33] when we realize that every thought that
[50:35] passes through my brain is not safe it's
[50:38] not the Holy Ghost it's not right amen
[50:40] because why because the Satan brother B
[50:43] said can put thoughts in your mind he
[50:45] can't read your mind but he can put
[50:46] thoughts in your mind he can whisper to
[50:48] that old carnal nature brother B said
[50:50] you'll always have on the outside man an
[50:52] old sticky Cocker nature amen and what
[50:55] becomes the most deceptive thing to us
[50:58] is when the Satan Whispers in our ear
[51:00] but he uses our voice so the voice
[51:03] ringing in your head is your own voice
[51:06] and you don't realize this is a lie of
[51:08] the devil trying to push me away from
[51:10] the word right and I think it's good for
[51:12] us all to realize amen that that there's
[51:15] still two Natures in one body amen and I
[51:18] got to make sure I don't cater to that
[51:20] one but I read that one subject to the
[51:22] to the New Birth nature amen because
[51:24] this is the one one that we want to rule
[51:28] am and and that's where really the
[51:31] reality is that's where our Deception
[51:33] comes from that's right where was
[51:35] Lucifer deceived he was deceived by his
[51:37] own
[51:39] brightness he it was self
[51:42] deception and so we want to make sure
[51:44] that every thought comes back to the
[51:47] word and and not just every thought
[51:49] comes back to the word in that way that
[51:51] I can find a scripture to match my
[51:53] thought I want to be very very careful
[51:55] with that that because remember when the
[51:57] prophet got offended after he preached
[51:58] the seals and he got upset because of
[52:01] his complex and his rejection as a child
[52:03] when they didn't hear the message and
[52:04] rejected him he is working up this plan
[52:06] where he was going to go up to Northern
[52:08] British Colombia because he was hurt he
[52:10] was offended and he thought they had
[52:12] heard his message and what did he use as
[52:14] his justification for going up there for
[52:16] tricking his wife and going up and and
[52:18] leaving everything and staying up there
[52:20] until God gives him a message he used
[52:22] the
[52:24] scriptures yes
[52:27] remember when the devil came to Jesus in
[52:30] the Temptation in the wilderness he used
[52:32] the
[52:34] scriptures so you got to be very careful
[52:37] just because a thought passes through
[52:38] your head and you can find a scripture
[52:40] to match it does not mean that that came
[52:43] from God Satan can give you scriptures
[52:46] too and brother brandom in his hurt in
[52:49] his human nature wanting to escape from
[52:51] the pain amen he found justification
[52:54] listen this is a man who loves God this
[52:56] is a man who knows the word he's not
[52:58] just going to run off and do something
[53:00] like this he needs this is I hope you
[53:03] don't think I'm rude speaking about the
[53:04] Prophet this way but in order for to
[53:06] make a step like that he's got to have
[53:08] justification and he's looking for
[53:10] justification to overcome the own alarm
[53:12] that's in his
[53:14] heart that's where every one of us are
[53:17] we have that little alarm in our heart
[53:19] we know that this isn't right but we
[53:20] ignore that alarm and we look for
[53:22] justification in the scriptures or in
[53:24] the message and guess what Satan will
[53:26] give you the justification you need to
[53:28] move Beyond The Alarm because the
[53:30] problem is that that move that brother
[53:32] Brenham was make that move was for self
[53:37] right and he had to die to self and
[53:40] acknowledge that he was wrong repent of
[53:42] his wrong share it with everybody and
[53:44] ask God to change him so he could go
[53:48] back into the
[53:49] ministry so don't this is what's so
[53:52] close with these two spirits and they're
[53:54] both religious
[53:59] really what it comes down to brother bam
[54:01] told
[54:03] us he said what God is judging is our
[54:06] motive and our
[54:11] objective what we need to do
[54:14] is finally get
[54:17] real we need to get down to the bottom
[54:20] of it and get to the
[54:23] reality what why do I want to do this
[54:28] really why not the religious terms I'm
[54:31] tacking to it but really why do I want
[54:35] to do this for self- protection for
[54:37] self-promotion for self
[54:42] gain amen prise Lord friends I think
[54:46] this is the only way we're going to
[54:47] overcome
[54:48] amen we start recognizing the enemy
[54:51] that's in the
[54:53] mirror and the greatest battle that's
[54:55] ever fought is going to be fought
[54:59] where not outside of me it's going to be
[55:01] fought in
[55:03] me and if I'm going to win this battle
[55:05] that's fought in me I'm going to have to
[55:07] learn the tactics of the devil and you
[55:08] say you just you just have to know the
[55:10] word that's absolutely true you have to
[55:12] know the word but don't forget the
[55:14] devil's going to use the
[55:19] word so you're going to have to know
[55:21] more than just the word you're going to
[55:22] have to have the spirit of God to help
[55:24] you discern your your own desire laying
[55:27] beside underneath your decision that's
[55:29] the deception right there it's not the
[55:31] deception is not what somebody's uh
[55:33] trying to get you to do no the deception
[55:35] is what's laying in your heart why you
[55:38] want to do that think about what
[55:41] happened with Eve Eve uh uh in the
[55:44] Garden of Eden amen she everything was
[55:46] perfect everything was in Paradise but
[55:48] there was those two trees that were
[55:49] standing there and she was given an
[55:51] instruction don't take the don't partake
[55:53] of this tree everything else is open and
[55:55] everything else is free there was only
[55:56] one
[55:57] commandment don't partake of this
[56:00] tree and the serpent come along and
[56:02] began to entice her and what he began to
[56:05] do is he began to create a desire in her
[56:08] amen he began to paint a picture that
[56:10] was different for her until within her
[56:13] she wanted to know what that tree was
[56:15] like amen and then she began to justify
[56:17] it and she began to say well she looked
[56:19] at the tree and it was good for food it
[56:21] was pleasant to the eye and it was a
[56:23] tree to be desired to make make one wise
[56:25] and then after her inspection or
[56:27] scrutiny she couldn't find any problem
[56:29] with it the problem with the tree was he
[56:32] said don't partake of
[56:34] it but the the Satan worked in her a
[56:37] desire a need to know something he was
[56:41] telling her he knows God does know that
[56:43] when you partake of it you shall be like
[56:45] Gods knowing good and evil now all of a
[56:47] sudden he created a need inside of her
[56:50] when this woman had zero need she didn't
[56:52] need for anything she didn't need for
[56:54] food she didn't need need housing she
[56:55] didn't need money she needed nothing she
[56:57] had perfect love perfect Faith perfect
[57:00] peace perfect everything what did she
[57:03] need what did she need she needed
[57:07] nothing so what did Satan do he created
[57:10] in her a
[57:11] need now you need to
[57:14] know now you're lacking you don't have
[57:17] something you could
[57:20] have you think he doesn't pull the same
[57:22] tricks on us yes yes
[57:26] and the one who needed nothing all of a
[57:28] sudden needed to
[57:29] know and she was willing to partake of
[57:32] that
[57:34] dream I think if we could lose self and
[57:38] if we could lose
[57:39] need we would be Invincible
[57:43] am
[57:45] yes if all I ever needed was Christ in
[57:49] it
[57:52] period if I had no other need
[57:55] than
[57:56] Christ and if I could completely die to
[57:59] myself there's not a thing in the world
[58:01] the devil could do with us right but
[58:04] those are the two things that keep
[58:05] tripping us
[58:08] up let's go to first Thessalonians
[58:11] chapter
[58:23] 4
[58:29] 1 Thessalonians chapter
[58:34] 4 verse
[58:38] one furthermore then we beseech you
[58:42] Brethren exhort and exhort you by the
[58:45] Lord Jesus that as ye have received of
[58:47] us how you ought to walk to please God
[58:49] so you would abound more and more for
[58:52] you know that for you know what
[58:54] Commandments we gave you by the Lord
[58:56] Jesus for this is the will of God even
[58:59] your sanctification that you should
[59:00] abstain from fornication that every one
[59:02] of you should know how to possess his
[59:05] vessel in sanctification and honor we
[59:08] read this before and we talked about how
[59:10] God wants us to possess our vessel he
[59:13] does not want our vessel to possess us
[59:15] so all the passions of the flesh are not
[59:17] to be possessing us we're not to be
[59:19] possessed by that but we're supposed to
[59:21] possess our
[59:22] vessel and so let's go to Revelations
[59:25] chap 20 with that scripture in mind I
[59:28] want to keep building on
[59:30] that and now I'm getting really moving
[59:33] past review and getting into the part
[59:35] that I really wanted to
[59:38] share about Esau kennot and herit the
[59:45] promise Revelations
[59:47] 20 verse
[59:50] 5 in verse 5 says but the rest of the
[59:53] Dead live not again until the the
[59:54] thousand years were finished this is the
[59:56] first resurrection blessed and holy is
[59:59] he that hath part in the First
[1:00:00] Resurrection on such the second death
[1:00:02] hath no power but they shall be Priests
[1:00:05] of God and of Christ and shall reign
[1:00:07] with him a thousand years so we know
[1:00:11] that those who come in the first
[1:00:13] resurrection they're going to Reign we
[1:00:16] believe that we be we'd be part of that
[1:00:18] group we will reign with him for a
[1:00:20] thousand years and he's we know that
[1:00:22] he's going to reign with a rod of iron
[1:00:24] and we go over to Revelation chap 2
[1:00:31] now Revelation chap
[1:00:35] 2 and verse
[1:00:41] 26 says and he that overcometh and
[1:00:44] keepeth my works until the end to him
[1:00:46] will I give power over the Nations and
[1:00:48] he shall rule them with a rod of iron as
[1:00:51] the vessel of a Potter shall he be
[1:00:53] broken to Shivers even even as I
[1:00:55] received of my father so we know that he
[1:00:58] that
[1:00:59] overcometh he that's in part in the
[1:01:01] first resurrection Will Rule and reign
[1:01:03] with Christ for a thousand years he will
[1:01:05] rule and reign with a rod of iron but
[1:01:07] here he's talking to the thoan church
[1:01:09] age and I think it's marvelous that he
[1:01:11] gave this to the thotran church age
[1:01:13] because this is the church age that was
[1:01:15] in the Dark Ages this is in the peak of
[1:01:17] the power of the Catholic church when
[1:01:18] they snuffed out everything that didn't
[1:01:20] believe they were the Holy Roman Empire
[1:01:22] they had power over Nations power over
[1:01:25] Kings this is the time of the
[1:01:26] inquisitions and everything else amen
[1:01:28] when they martyred so many and they and
[1:01:31] they this is when the bride tree was ate
[1:01:33] down to just a stump and everything was
[1:01:35] gone and almost no life left and what
[1:01:38] was it this was the ox age this was the
[1:01:40] age when they completely surrendered
[1:01:42] their life and gave themselves up even
[1:01:44] unto death that's right but he told them
[1:01:47] you who in this age have overcome and
[1:01:50] surrendered your life and laid down your
[1:01:51] life and given to this power you shall
[1:01:55] rule with a rod of iron amen I think
[1:01:57] that's amazing that this group who
[1:01:59] surrendered all they're the ones who get
[1:02:01] to rule with a rod of iron when will
[1:02:03] they rule with a rod of iron and when
[1:02:06] will they rule the nations with a rod of
[1:02:07] iron I believe in the millennial Reign I
[1:02:09] believe when they when Christ rules with
[1:02:11] a rod of
[1:02:12] iron and so you see what it took for
[1:02:14] them to get to that place they had to
[1:02:16] overcome what they would overcome the
[1:02:17] Dark Ages they had to overcome self they
[1:02:19] had to surrender all they had to give
[1:02:21] the ultimate
[1:02:22] sacrifice their life
[1:02:26] I was looking at this and this is where
[1:02:28] my meditation has been lately I was
[1:02:32] looking at this subject of the
[1:02:34] millennial Reign and this is when Christ
[1:02:36] returns to set up his kingdom physically
[1:02:38] upon the Earth and we rule and reign
[1:02:40] with him we're part of that Kingdom
[1:02:42] we're part of the ruling Authority amen
[1:02:44] we're part of the Kingdom that gives
[1:02:46] rulership and there's even discussion in
[1:02:49] the scriptures where where there's even
[1:02:51] uh uh we we even take part in the Govern
[1:02:54] government so that if even Egypt doesn't
[1:02:57] come up to the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:02:59] there'll be no reain for them there'll
[1:03:00] be retribution there'll be correction
[1:03:02] there'll be teaching there'll be
[1:03:03] instruction there'll be all of this
[1:03:04] going on in the Millennium and we'll be
[1:03:06] part of it amen he told them that you
[1:03:09] know I'll give I'll make you ruler over
[1:03:11] cities and when are these these promises
[1:03:13] going to take place and when are these
[1:03:14] rewards going to come in the millennial
[1:03:17] Reign but where my meditation was is how
[1:03:21] in the world am I going to sit on the
[1:03:24] throne with Jesus Christ and Rule and
[1:03:26] Reign for a thousand years when I can't
[1:03:29] rule this little plot of Earth he's
[1:03:31] given me
[1:03:32] today what makes me think that I'm going
[1:03:36] to rule in the Millennium with Christ
[1:03:38] when he's asked me to possess one little
[1:03:40] clump of dirt one little corner one
[1:03:43] posty stamp size of Earth and he's given
[1:03:46] not a city not a village not a town not
[1:03:49] even a household he has given me one
[1:03:51] little clump of his dirt creation and
[1:03:54] he's asking me to rule that and I can't
[1:03:56] even bring this clump of dirt to
[1:03:58] subjection to the word what makes me
[1:04:01] think I'm going to rule and reign in the
[1:04:03] Millennium if we're not able amen by the
[1:04:06] grace of God and by the spirit of God to
[1:04:08] bring this dirt into subjection to the
[1:04:10] word by the by the authority of the word
[1:04:13] and the power of the spirit what makes
[1:04:15] us think we're fit to rule and Reign for
[1:04:16] a thousand years I say God help me to
[1:04:19] get it right now amen help me to take
[1:04:22] that word and bring how am I going to
[1:04:23] bring Egypt subjection to the word and
[1:04:26] say Egypt if you don't come to Feast of
[1:04:27] Tabernacles you get no rain when I'm not
[1:04:30] coming subject to all of the
[1:04:32] word what
[1:04:36] hypocrisy say God help me you've got to
[1:04:40] help me God I I I'm tired of looking
[1:04:43] everywhere else for what's wrong I'm
[1:04:45] finding plenty of wrong right here I've
[1:04:47] got enough wrong right here to preoccupy
[1:04:49] the rest of my days on Earth I'm pretty
[1:04:51] sure of
[1:04:53] that but but now I realize what my goal
[1:04:55] is because what does he want in the
[1:04:57] great plan of God he had a three-fold
[1:04:59] purpose and the second part is to get
[1:05:01] preeminence in a man what does he want
[1:05:03] he wants full control right here he
[1:05:05] wants somebody to give him first place
[1:05:07] and I want to be I want to be the patch
[1:05:09] of earth that is dedicated and
[1:05:12] designated to Jesus Christ the word
[1:05:14] alone and there's one spot on Earth
[1:05:16] where God is glorified one spot where
[1:05:18] his name is well spoken of one spot
[1:05:20] where he's glorified one spot where he
[1:05:22] rules and Reigns if it's not anywhere
[1:05:24] else in the earth I want it to be in
[1:05:26] this earth right
[1:05:27] [Applause]
[1:05:29] here that's my goal that's what I'm
[1:05:31] working for that's what I'm striving for
[1:05:34] is to keep this flesh subdued and let
[1:05:37] Christ take leadership rulership
[1:05:39] ownership over this
[1:05:42] flesh I want to read a couple scriptures
[1:05:45] just in line with what I'm thinking if
[1:05:46] you can turn with me to Proverbs
[1:05:52] 25 and I I hope that the meditation that
[1:05:55] I have and the things I've been dwelling
[1:05:56] on they hit home and they they become a
[1:05:59] reality and you understand my heart and
[1:06:02] what I'm
[1:06:05] saying Proverbs
[1:06:08] 25
[1:06:13] 28 Proverbs
[1:06:15] 25:28 he that hath no rule over his own
[1:06:18] spirit is like a city that is broken
[1:06:20] down and Without
[1:06:23] Walls
[1:06:24] you mean we're supposed to have rule
[1:06:25] over our own
[1:06:29] spirit I thought that's what the Holy
[1:06:31] Ghost was for is to come so I don't have
[1:06:33] to ever make any decisions and I
[1:06:37] don't you realize the coming of the Holy
[1:06:40] Ghost is the power to help you live a
[1:06:42] Christian life amen it brings the word
[1:06:45] to life in you it quickens the seed of
[1:06:47] God inside of you amen but just because
[1:06:50] you received the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:51] Ghost and have the indwelling of the
[1:06:53] Holy Ghost God never never took away
[1:06:54] your Power of
[1:06:56] Choice you can still choose which nature
[1:06:59] you cater
[1:07:02] to amen Proverbs
[1:07:11] 16 Proverbs
[1:07:16] 16:32 and Proverbs 16:32 he says he that
[1:07:19] is slow to anger is better than the
[1:07:21] mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit
[1:07:23] than he that taketh the
[1:07:27] city we've got some work to do right
[1:07:31] here let's go back to Revelation chapter
[1:07:47] 3 Revelation CH 3 verse
[1:07:52] 21 to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:07:55] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[1:07:58] also overcame and him sat down with my
[1:08:01] father and his
[1:08:02] throne Jesus is here in leoda this is
[1:08:06] the leodan church age and he's saying to
[1:08:08] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[1:08:09] with me in my Throne to overcome what to
[1:08:13] overcome leysia what's the leodan
[1:08:17] condition saying I'm rich increased with
[1:08:19] goods and have need of nothing and not
[1:08:20] realizing or blind miserable poor
[1:08:22] wretched
[1:08:24] and all of those things and he that
[1:08:26] overcometh you can overcome that
[1:08:29] condition amen and overcome the
[1:08:31] deception in the world and I say this
[1:08:33] and overcome the deception in
[1:08:35] yourself because that's where the
[1:08:37] problem was in
[1:08:38] leoda the problem was a
[1:08:42] self-deception i they they thought they
[1:08:44] were rich and increased with goods and
[1:08:46] had need of nothing and they did not
[1:08:48] realize that they were blind poor
[1:08:51] miserable naked and wretched they didn't
[1:08:52] know the problem problem in leod deia
[1:08:55] was
[1:08:57] self-deception and isav would open our
[1:09:00] eyes to that and this message is our IAB
[1:09:02] friends to him that overcometh I'll
[1:09:04] Grant to sit with me in my throne and
[1:09:07] then the question that I ask is what is
[1:09:09] his throne and we know in the future
[1:09:11] that he's going to take the Throne of
[1:09:12] his father
[1:09:14] David but brother bam tells us where his
[1:09:17] throne is back in 1958 in the message
[1:09:20] the UN Unity of one God and the one
[1:09:22] church say every man born on Earth is
[1:09:25] born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[1:09:27] the world speaking lies that's right so
[1:09:29] in the carnal adamic nature how can a
[1:09:33] man achieve anything only by through his
[1:09:36] intellectuals but when he comes to be a
[1:09:38] new creature and the old man has passed
[1:09:40] out and the new man Christ takes his
[1:09:43] throne in the human
[1:09:45] heart when life looks different then
[1:09:47] then he starts on a new road from his
[1:09:49] own selfish motives till the big ideas
[1:09:51] to make himself something big he starts
[1:09:54] right towards Calvary to recognize God
[1:09:56] then all his objective his motive his
[1:09:58] achievement and all that he is lays in
[1:10:01] the glory of the Cross where Christ paid
[1:10:03] the price for human life Christ is our
[1:10:06] life then in in 1961 in Revelation 4 he
[1:10:11] says now we're living in another age
[1:10:13] Glory oh I love this age don't you now
[1:10:16] God has a mercy seat today to be guarded
[1:10:19] you believe that where's The Mercy Seat
[1:10:21] found in the heart of man when did come
[1:10:23] into the heart of man at the day of
[1:10:25] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost which is
[1:10:27] God came into the human heart is that
[1:10:30] right so now where is his throne his
[1:10:34] throne is in the heart of
[1:10:37] man his throne is where the mercy seat
[1:10:39] is and he says he that overcome can sit
[1:10:42] with me in my Throne hey I know that
[1:10:45] we're going to sit with him on the
[1:10:46] millennial Throne I know that I believe
[1:10:48] that with all my heart amen but he's now
[1:10:50] sitting in another
[1:10:52] Throne he's sitting in this Throne amen
[1:10:55] and we're supposed to be joint HS and
[1:10:57] we're supposed to rule and reign with
[1:10:59] him amen is that right we rule and reign
[1:11:02] with him for a thousand years if we're
[1:11:04] going to rule and reign with him for a
[1:11:06] thousand years why don't we rule and
[1:11:07] reign with him now in conjunction with
[1:11:10] him now where's his throne his throne is
[1:11:13] in the human heart where's The Mercy
[1:11:14] Seat in the human heart when did it come
[1:11:16] in the human heart at Pentecost he wants
[1:11:19] us to climb up on his throne and Rule
[1:11:21] and reign with him and he wants us to
[1:11:23] judge the nations with him amen why
[1:11:25] don't we start judging now why don't we
[1:11:27] start ruling now and you say brother
[1:11:29] Chad where are you going to rule I've
[1:11:30] got enough territory right
[1:11:35] here this is all the territory I can
[1:11:38] handle right now in the future he may
[1:11:40] give me a Village he may give me cities
[1:11:42] he may whatever but for right now this
[1:11:44] is my training ground for the Millennium
[1:11:47] I'm in premillennial training camp right
[1:11:49] now and this boot camp is tough Brothers
[1:11:52] I'm telling you it's a tough one and I
[1:11:54] keep getting tripped up by spirits and I
[1:11:56] get tripped up by my own motives you
[1:11:58] know the subjects that I'm given the
[1:11:59] rule is only one subject that's the old
[1:12:01] carnal nature of Chad I have one subject
[1:12:05] to rule over and that subject keeps
[1:12:07] tripping me up and he pulls little
[1:12:09] deceiving games on me and this old
[1:12:11] nature of Chad keeps tripping me up and
[1:12:13] I haven't yet outsmarted him
[1:12:18] completely amen you think you think
[1:12:22] we're fit to go sit on the throne of the
[1:12:25] whole world and be
[1:12:28] part we're so
[1:12:30] proud true I tell you what I make myself
[1:12:34] sick
[1:12:36] sometimes when I stop and really think
[1:12:39] about what I really am on my own what my
[1:12:42] flesh really is and what my carnal and
[1:12:45] then think of some of the pompous things
[1:12:47] that I've said and some of the attitudes
[1:12:48] that I pull I make myself
[1:12:52] sick that's
[1:12:57] right you know what I want to do I want
[1:13:00] to abase this man and base this man and
[1:13:02] aase this man and I want the word to
[1:13:05] rule the word to rule the word to rule
[1:13:07] and I want to rule in way rain with
[1:13:09] Christ and I want to make my decisions
[1:13:12] my choices I want to bring this body
[1:13:14] subject to the
[1:13:19] word can't ask for cities God I think
[1:13:22] I'll take three cities
[1:13:24] I think I'm
[1:13:25] ready can you imagine I just sometimes I
[1:13:30] feel like I feel like a little kid
[1:13:32] talking to God
[1:13:35] sometimes God I'm ready for the
[1:13:36] millennial Reign and God's looking at us
[1:13:38] thinking listen you you haven't even
[1:13:41] tackled your own
[1:13:43] desires you haven't even conquered the
[1:13:46] own L your own lust of the flesh I you
[1:13:49] have you haven't even kept your hands
[1:13:52] from touching what shouldn't touch you
[1:13:54] haven't even stopped your eyes from
[1:13:56] looking at what it shouldn't look at you
[1:13:58] think you're going to rule over a city
[1:14:00] you haven't even got enough dominion
[1:14:02] over the territory I give you to turn
[1:14:04] your head when you ought to turn your
[1:14:05] head Son of God and you think you're
[1:14:07] going to rule over
[1:14:11] cities sometimes we need to go back to
[1:14:13] kindergarten and get the ABC's
[1:14:17] right praise
[1:14:19] God so we we realize that I I'm I
[1:14:23] believe we're in training for reigning I
[1:14:26] believe this is it but I've been given
[1:14:29] an unruly
[1:14:33] territory sometimes I feel unfairly
[1:14:37] treated I got the genetics of mom and
[1:14:40] dad and I got Grandpa coming back and I
[1:14:43] got willfulness and all these things and
[1:14:46] been injected in me through the genetics
[1:14:49] and and I
[1:14:52] sometimes like God this body you gave
[1:14:56] me to rain
[1:15:03] over see the
[1:15:05] point I think we got plenty to do I
[1:15:09] think we got plenty to pray about I
[1:15:11] think we got plenty to line up to the
[1:15:18] word God gave us a good training
[1:15:21] ground brother B said in the God of this
[1:15:24] evil age he said we find now this evil
[1:15:26] age is to prove to Satan she is not like
[1:15:29] Eve she is not that type of woman and
[1:15:32] she will be Tried by his word the Bride
[1:15:34] As Adam's bride was Tried by the word
[1:15:36] and Adam's bride believed every bit of
[1:15:38] the word all but confused on one promise
[1:15:41] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:15:44] forever today see but failed on One
[1:15:47] Promise under the temptation of the
[1:15:49] enemy face to face and now the people
[1:15:52] that's called called for his name of
[1:15:54] course is his bride she is to come in
[1:15:56] contact Again by the same thing amen not
[1:15:59] just the denominational truth or
[1:16:01] something but every word
[1:16:03] amen we're not going to escape it we
[1:16:06] can't leave it back in the Garden of
[1:16:07] Eden but the garden of Eden's
[1:16:09] here the same the the same decision is
[1:16:13] now the same two trees are present today
[1:16:16] amen and the question is which one are
[1:16:17] we going to choose and that's the choice
[1:16:19] that we get to
[1:16:21] make brother says in the Sixth Seal he
[1:16:24] says now you tonight are the same place
[1:16:26] that Adam and Eve was in the Garden of
[1:16:27] Eden you have a right you're a free
[1:16:29] moral agent you can go to the tree of
[1:16:31] life or you can take the plan of
[1:16:35] judgment he says in the breach now of
[1:16:37] course when Adam fell to death he
[1:16:39] brought death upon all creation now he
[1:16:41] was given free moral agency it was given
[1:16:43] to him just to make a choice now Adam
[1:16:46] and Eve in the beginning there was a
[1:16:48] tree of right and wrong before them and
[1:16:50] that same tree sets before each and
[1:16:52] every one of us amen you believe that he
[1:16:55] called it a tree of right and wrong then
[1:16:56] it was a tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:16:58] Evil and a tree of life he called it a
[1:16:59] tree of death and a tree of life right
[1:17:01] before us stands two trees and and and
[1:17:05] and if I could just take it in my own
[1:17:07] language if you'll just forgive me for a
[1:17:08] minute right inside of me is two
[1:17:11] trees two Natures amen one of them will
[1:17:14] bring me to death one of them will bring
[1:17:16] me to
[1:17:19] life amen and the question is which one
[1:17:21] am I going to eat off of
[1:17:23] and I say you know when when you go back
[1:17:26] and you look at the scriptures and you
[1:17:27] take it holistically at the whole thing
[1:17:29] all the way back in the beginning man
[1:17:31] had absolutely everything that they had
[1:17:33] need of there was one commandment given
[1:17:35] them and if they would have kept that
[1:17:37] one commandment there would have never
[1:17:38] been a need for another commandment
[1:17:41] ever ever there would be no need for
[1:17:44] nothing else if they would have kept
[1:17:45] that first commandment and not eaten of
[1:17:47] that tree but I tell you we've come down
[1:17:49] to a decision now we're facing two trees
[1:17:52] now right and wrong sets before us now
[1:17:54] are we going to cater to Esau or are we
[1:17:56] going to let Jacob
[1:17:59] live it's come down to you and I and
[1:18:02] it's come down to
[1:18:05] today but the same Commandment that
[1:18:07] started it all still works good
[1:18:10] today if we'll leave self
[1:18:13] alone and go after
[1:18:16] Christ we'll be fine
[1:18:19] amen if we'll not eat of the tree of
[1:18:22] self
[1:18:24] and will'll just partake of Christ and
[1:18:27] deny self will be
[1:18:31] okay I still think it's the Commandment
[1:18:34] that solves all the
[1:18:36] problems today it's still the
[1:18:39] Commandment that solves all the
[1:18:41] problems he
[1:18:45] says he says in Satan's Eden God's Great
[1:18:48] Kingdom will be taken
[1:18:50] back because Jesus fought it out with
[1:18:52] Satan In The Garden of Gethsemane and he
[1:18:55] won back
[1:18:56] Eden and we look at Jesus battling it
[1:19:00] out in
[1:19:01] Gethsemane and brother brandham said he
[1:19:03] battled it out with
[1:19:05] Satan Jesus fought it out with Satan in
[1:19:07] the Garden of Gethsemane and won back
[1:19:09] the Eden but when you go and you look at
[1:19:12] the Garden of Gethsemane and you look at
[1:19:14] uh Jesus's Agony amen you don't it's not
[1:19:17] apparent that he's fighting it out with
[1:19:19] Satan it's not apparent that Satan's
[1:19:21] there but what is apparent is that he's
[1:19:23] in agony he's in distress and he's
[1:19:25] praying and he keeps praying the same
[1:19:27] prayer God is there any way that I can
[1:19:30] bypass this
[1:19:32] word that's the question is there any
[1:19:34] way that I can bypass this word and he
[1:19:37] asked three times is there any way I can
[1:19:40] avoid this cup and every time he says
[1:19:42] the same thing at the end but not my
[1:19:44] will but thine be
[1:19:46] done how did he win Gethsemane in
[1:19:49] Gethsemane he died to his wants he died
[1:19:52] to his desires he died to everything
[1:19:54] that was the thing that Eve was not able
[1:19:56] to do she was not able to die to all of
[1:19:59] those desires she saw the tree was good
[1:20:01] for food she could have died to it right
[1:20:06] she saw that it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:20:08] she could have rejected
[1:20:09] it she saw that it was good all of those
[1:20:12] things had to do with self all three of
[1:20:14] those Temptations had to do with her
[1:20:17] good for food for her Pleasant to her
[1:20:19] eyes good to make her wise amen she
[1:20:21] could have died to self if she would
[1:20:23] have died to self she would have never
[1:20:24] been
[1:20:27] tempted and here's Jesus Christ in the
[1:20:30] Garden of Gethsemane and brother benam
[1:20:32] says he's in agony amen he begin to be
[1:20:34] troubled in his spirit all the way back
[1:20:36] at the supper when they were at supper
[1:20:38] then he's in great Agony in the garden
[1:20:40] brother B says why he said he didn't
[1:20:42] want to leave his disciples whom he
[1:20:43] loved and he didn't want to go through
[1:20:45] the pain of the Cross he knows what's
[1:20:48] coming and he doesn't want the
[1:20:49] separation that
[1:20:51] self he does doesn't want to suffer the
[1:20:53] pain that's
[1:20:55] self and Jesus now comes in the Garden
[1:20:58] of Gethsemane and he's asking Lord is
[1:21:01] there any possible way I can bypass this
[1:21:04] part of the
[1:21:08] word he says no but not my will but
[1:21:11] thine be done he goes and checks on his
[1:21:13] disciples he comes back a second time
[1:21:15] father is there any way this cup can
[1:21:17] pass me by but not my will but thine be
[1:21:21] done the third time
[1:21:29] time he he had to surrender
[1:21:37] all we're going to have to get there
[1:21:40] friends somehow someway this word is
[1:21:43] going to have to give us strength and
[1:21:44] it's going to have to expose the devil
[1:21:46] in every tactic until we finally get to
[1:21:48] that place until we say God is there any
[1:21:52] way I could buy bypass this word not my
[1:21:55] will but thine be
[1:21:58] done not I can find a loophole a
[1:22:01] justification Twisted scripture no just
[1:22:04] flat coming down to fathers there's any
[1:22:06] way I can avoid this
[1:22:08] word not my will but thine be
[1:22:14] done all the way back in the beginning
[1:22:17] the devil got victory over the word of
[1:22:19] God when he got one of his subjects
[1:22:20] brother B said the weaker one to let
[1:22:23] down the bar on the word and that's how
[1:22:25] he's won the victory every time is when
[1:22:28] he gets one of his subjects to let down
[1:22:30] the bar on one
[1:22:35] word why did they let down the bar on
[1:22:37] the word
[1:22:40] self you see why I say we're going to
[1:22:42] have to die to
[1:22:44] self I don't know if you're like
[1:22:47] me you probably thought when you come to
[1:22:49] the message you died to
[1:22:51] self I'll raise my hand I got rid of my
[1:22:55] cable TV and threw all my shorts away
[1:22:57] and I died to
[1:23:00] myself and that was part of a
[1:23:02] death there was part of dying to self
[1:23:04] I'd lived all my life that way I thought
[1:23:06] it was right I had to acknowledge it was
[1:23:08] wrong I had to die to myself but oh if I
[1:23:11] only realized how much more self there
[1:23:13] was to die to there was a heaping mound
[1:23:16] of self and I thought I had just died to
[1:23:19] all of myself and there's this monstrous
[1:23:21] blob of self behind me
[1:23:24] haunting me but God keeps creating more
[1:23:27] opportunities and more opportunities for
[1:23:29] us to die to
[1:23:30] ourselves more opportunities and I think
[1:23:33] sometimes the greatest thing God can
[1:23:34] ever do for us is make us come face to
[1:23:36] face with our
[1:23:38] self and die to what we see to
[1:23:43] surrender we know the greatest battle
[1:23:46] ever fought they had to find a mutual
[1:23:48] meeting ground and that Mutual meeting
[1:23:49] ground was in the mind of man that's
[1:23:52] where you got to meet your
[1:23:54] enemy and that's where you have to
[1:23:56] defeat your
[1:24:00] enemy in First Peter let's go to First
[1:24:03] Peter chapter
[1:24:21] 4 1 Peter chapter 4 verse
[1:24:25] one for as much then as Christ has
[1:24:28] suffered for us in the flesh arm
[1:24:30] yourselves likewise with the same mind
[1:24:33] for he that has suffered In the Flesh
[1:24:34] has ceased from sin that he no longer
[1:24:37] shall live the rest of his time in the
[1:24:39] flesh to the lust of men but to the will
[1:24:42] of
[1:24:44] God this is a great
[1:24:47] scripture Jesus suffered in the
[1:24:51] flesh but he
[1:24:54] overcame he that ha suffered In the
[1:24:56] Flesh has ceased from
[1:24:58] sin that he no longer should live the
[1:25:00] rest of his time in the flesh to the
[1:25:03] lust of men but to the will of God
[1:25:06] that's how we're supposed to live we're
[1:25:08] supposed to suffer in this flesh what do
[1:25:11] you mean suffer in this flesh fight with
[1:25:13] it hate it resist
[1:25:15] it subdue it to the word suffer in this
[1:25:18] flesh so that we no longer should live
[1:25:21] the rest of the time in the flesh and to
[1:25:23] the lust of men but to the will of God
[1:25:26] so the rest of the time that I live in
[1:25:27] this flesh I don't want to live it to
[1:25:29] the lust of men but I want to live it to
[1:25:30] the will of
[1:25:32] God go over to First John we read this
[1:25:35] scripture last time but I want to remind
[1:25:37] you of it first John chapter
[1:25:40] 2 just a few pages over 1 John chapter 2
[1:25:45] verse
[1:25:48] 15 love not the world neither the things
[1:25:50] that are in the world If any man love
[1:25:53] the world the love of the father is not
[1:25:54] in him for all that is in the world the
[1:25:57] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:26:00] and the pride of life is not of the
[1:26:02] father but is of the
[1:26:06] world all of that has to do with
[1:26:10] self I hope you're catching a theme amen
[1:26:14] let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:26:21] 4
[1:26:39] Matthew
[1:26:42] 4:1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[1:26:44] Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:26:46] devil and when he had fasted 40 days and
[1:26:49] 40 nights he was afterward a hunger and
[1:26:51] when the tempter came came to him he
[1:26:52] said if thou be the Son of God command
[1:26:54] that these Stones be made bread but he
[1:26:56] answered and said it is written man
[1:26:58] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:27:00] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:27:01] mouth of God then the devil taketh him
[1:27:04] up into the holy city and Seth him on a
[1:27:06] pinnacle of the temple say than him if
[1:27:08] thou be the Son of God cast thyself down
[1:27:10] for it is
[1:27:12] written he shall give his angels charge
[1:27:14] concerning thee and in their hands they
[1:27:17] shall bear thee up lest at any time thou
[1:27:19] Dash thy foot against the stone Jesus
[1:27:21] said unto him it is written Thou shalt
[1:27:23] not tempt the Lord thy God again the
[1:27:26] devil taketh him up into an exceeding
[1:27:27] high mountain and showeth him all the
[1:27:29] kingdoms of the world and the glory of
[1:27:31] them and saith unto him all these things
[1:27:33] will I give thee if thou Willl Fall Down
[1:27:35] and Worship me then saith Jesus unto him
[1:27:38] get thee hence Satan for it is written
[1:27:40] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[1:27:43] him only shalt thou serve then the devil
[1:27:45] leaveth him behold Angels Came and
[1:27:47] ministered unto
[1:27:49] him this is Jesus's great test
[1:27:52] is Temptation in the wilderness and
[1:27:55] every Temptation had to do with
[1:27:59] self he had fasted 40 days and now he
[1:28:01] was a hungered he was hungry and so he
[1:28:04] tempted him with wanting
[1:28:06] bread he tempted him with the word to
[1:28:09] cast down his own body and that God
[1:28:10] would protect his own body and lest it
[1:28:12] be dashed to pieces and and he with stod
[1:28:15] him with the word then he was tempted
[1:28:17] Amen to be glorified before his time to
[1:28:20] have all the kingdoms of the world of
[1:28:22] the pride of life he was tempted with
[1:28:24] that and he overcame by the word but
[1:28:27] every one of jesus' Temptations had to
[1:28:29] do with self and he overcame the desire
[1:28:32] to fulfill self or to prove self or to
[1:28:35] feed
[1:28:39] self I think it's marvelous
[1:28:42] friends the example that's been given to
[1:28:45] us because we get tempted the same
[1:28:48] way most of our failures is has
[1:28:51] something to do with is self we're
[1:28:53] guarding oursel we're protecting ourself
[1:28:55] we're exalting oursel we have a problem
[1:28:57] with pride or we have a need to protect
[1:29:00] self and in order to protect self we
[1:29:03] leave the word in order to feed self we
[1:29:06] leave the word in order to promote self
[1:29:08] we leave the word yes and the problem
[1:29:11] itself and the Devil comes with such a
[1:29:13] slick Temptation he uses the word to try
[1:29:15] to get Jesus to serve
[1:29:18] himself but oh praise God Jesus comes
[1:29:21] right around and use is the word to
[1:29:22] defeat the
[1:29:24] Devil amen we go then we go to the
[1:29:28] Garden of Gethsemane it's the same thing
[1:29:30] it's all about him denying himself and
[1:29:34] we find that Jesus he lived the life for
[1:29:37] others he didn't live for himself he
[1:29:38] lived a life and surrendered to the will
[1:29:40] of father he was the example for us
[1:29:43] we're coming in his footsteps we're
[1:29:44] following after him his bride must have
[1:29:46] his same characteristics she must live
[1:29:49] the way he lived she's coming to a
[1:29:51] perfection where this bride will be so
[1:29:53] much like him she will be
[1:29:56] him and I think we need to follow in the
[1:29:59] footsteps of Christ and we need to
[1:30:00] follow his example and we need to lose
[1:30:07] self you know what when he when he went
[1:30:10] before
[1:30:11] Pilate pilate tries to get Jesus to
[1:30:14] defend himself and he won't defend
[1:30:18] himself he tries to get him to save his
[1:30:21] own life and he says know you not that I
[1:30:23] have
[1:30:24] power and Jesus isn't even trying to
[1:30:27] save his own life because he knows the
[1:30:28] will of the father he knows his hands
[1:30:30] are in his his life is in God's hands
[1:30:32] and he wants nothing else but the will
[1:30:34] of God he wants nothing else if God
[1:30:37] determines that I die today I want
[1:30:39] nothing else but the will of
[1:30:41] God oh I don't I don't I can't say that
[1:30:44] I'm there friends but I want to be there
[1:30:46] I want to get to the place where if
[1:30:48] that's what God wants that's what I want
[1:30:50] if that's what God says best and that's
[1:30:52] what the word says that's all I want
[1:30:54] I'll never be able to make the flesh
[1:30:56] like it the flesh may never have a full
[1:30:58] agreement with it but I'm not here to
[1:31:00] make the flesh feel good I am here to
[1:31:03] subdue this flesh and bring it subject
[1:31:05] to the word of God I'm not waiting for
[1:31:08] my flesh to like the word I'm not
[1:31:10] waiting for my flesh to like God's
[1:31:12] decisions in order for me to go with
[1:31:13] that sometimes you you march forward and
[1:31:16] you kill the Flesh and you let it be
[1:31:18] dead because it's never going to want
[1:31:20] the word of God
[1:31:22] that's right amen it's always going to
[1:31:24] want to save
[1:31:27] itself says some people tries to
[1:31:29] introduce Christianity that you're free
[1:31:31] from worry you're free from tension oh
[1:31:34] no you add tension when you become a
[1:31:36] Christian because you was kind of Go
[1:31:38] Happy gol lucky whatever was out there
[1:31:41] not caring what you did but when you
[1:31:42] become a real Christian every moment
[1:31:44] you're wondering am I pleasing the Lord
[1:31:47] if I could hear from him it puts you on
[1:31:49] tension puts you on guard that's what
[1:31:51] makes what you
[1:31:52] are listen before you before we were
[1:31:55] Christians before we were real genuine
[1:31:57] Christians I didn't care what people
[1:32:01] thought I did what I wanted to do I said
[1:32:05] what I felt like saying when I felt like
[1:32:07] saying
[1:32:08] it you guys probably wouldn't have liked
[1:32:13] me if somebody irritated me I told them
[1:32:16] exactly what I thought if they didn't
[1:32:18] like it that's their problem not my
[1:32:20] problem why because I only lived for
[1:32:24] self I didn't care as long as I defended
[1:32:27] myself and as long as I defended my
[1:32:29] reputation as long as I didn't let them
[1:32:31] talk bad about me and as long as I put
[1:32:32] them in their place and as long as
[1:32:34] nobody tread on me and nobody took from
[1:32:36] me and nobody disrespected
[1:32:41] me but when you become a Christian now
[1:32:44] everything's changed I can't just say
[1:32:46] whatever I want to say I can't just set
[1:32:47] things right I can't just defend myself
[1:32:50] why because I care what he thinks amen
[1:32:53] what he wants from me is more important
[1:32:55] than self then it puts you under tension
[1:32:58] wanting to know that you're pleasing the
[1:32:59] Lord all the time because you've moved
[1:33:01] from pleasing self to pleasing the Lord
[1:33:03] we start off pleasing self all the time
[1:33:05] but now our desire is to please
[1:33:08] him and it puts us under
[1:33:12] tension brother B made this statement in
[1:33:15] Rising of the Sun and thought it was
[1:33:17] interesting it's just a little something
[1:33:19] he injects but it says a lot to me
[1:33:22] say there they want to believe Lord he's
[1:33:25] praying the people want to believe oh
[1:33:28] surely that seed is not dead Lord how
[1:33:31] could they raise their hand like that
[1:33:33] there is something oh God something's
[1:33:35] hindering it's something he said it's
[1:33:38] old
[1:33:39] self it's that wife of job standing
[1:33:42] there saying
[1:33:43] oh that's all he says then he goes but
[1:33:46] oh Lord let that job that believer walk
[1:33:49] in this morning die completely and be
[1:33:51] buried here in the baptism of
[1:33:54] waters what is it they they surely they
[1:33:57] want to believe Lord they've raised
[1:33:58] their hands what's the resistance it's
[1:34:00] old self it's the wife of Job saying how
[1:34:04] can you give any more than that
[1:34:07] you why don't you just Curse God and die
[1:34:10] what more can you give but no let us
[1:34:12] come like job and say you be quiet flesh
[1:34:15] you be quiet and hold your peace you
[1:34:17] speak like a
[1:34:19] fool the lord giveth the lord taketh
[1:34:22] away blessed be the name of the
[1:34:25] Lord the death to
[1:34:29] self
[1:34:32] amen he says in identifi with Christ in
[1:34:35] 59 he says but I challenge you tonight
[1:34:39] identify yourself with Jesus Christ and
[1:34:41] his death and his resurrection and see
[1:34:42] where you'll be at the resurrection for
[1:34:45] if we suffer with him we shall reign
[1:34:46] with him God has given us the promise
[1:34:49] and my whole desire is to be like him
[1:34:52] take me oh Lord and mold me and make me
[1:34:55] and shakee me over again like the
[1:34:57] prophet that went down in The Potter's
[1:34:58] House break me up and remold me how many
[1:35:01] of you want to pray that this
[1:35:05] morning let's go to First Corinthians I
[1:35:08] just want to read three more scriptures
[1:35:09] as we close let's go to 1 Corinthians
[1:35:20] 9
[1:35:22] how many of you believe Paul the Apostle
[1:35:24] had the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:26] Ghost which is good so we're going to
[1:35:28] read what he wrote Because we know now
[1:35:29] that it comply to
[1:35:31] us he
[1:35:33] says in uh chapter 9 1 Corinthians
[1:35:37] chapter 9: 24 know you not that they
[1:35:40] which run in a race run all but one
[1:35:42] receive the price so run that you may
[1:35:44] obtain and every man that striveth for
[1:35:46] the Mastery is tempered in all things
[1:35:48] now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[1:35:49] Crown but we an Incorruptible I
[1:35:52] therefore so run not as uncertain so
[1:35:54] fight I not as one that beateth the air
[1:35:57] but I keep under my body and bring it
[1:35:59] into subjection lest that by any means
[1:36:02] when I have preached to others I myself
[1:36:04] should be a Cast
[1:36:07] Away Paul wasn't saying I've got the
[1:36:10] spirit the spirit takes care of it
[1:36:13] all Paul was realizing he still had free
[1:36:15] moral agency yes and he was keeping
[1:36:19] under his body and he was bringing it
[1:36:22] subject lest he be a cast
[1:36:25] away he was never giving his
[1:36:27] responsibility over to somebody else and
[1:36:30] blaming God every time he did something
[1:36:31] wrong CU God didn't stop
[1:36:35] him God you could have stop me God why
[1:36:38] didn't you stop me guy God why did you
[1:36:40] let this happen I've prayed those
[1:36:42] prayers but you know what you're saying
[1:36:43] you're blaming God for your own sinful
[1:36:46] Choice you're blaming God for giving
[1:36:48] into the Flesh and giving into fleshly
[1:36:50] desires you're saying God why did you
[1:36:52] let this happen God why didn't you stop
[1:36:54] this and the truth is God can stop amen
[1:36:57] God can interject God can change the
[1:36:58] scene he but but he put us on free moral
[1:37:01] agency and he's not going to take take
[1:37:03] that away because sometimes we need to
[1:37:05] know how low down we really
[1:37:08] are sometimes we need to realize what
[1:37:10] Esau is really like he acts religious
[1:37:13] he'll sing and he'll smile and he'll say
[1:37:15] nice things but what is he really he's
[1:37:17] really a despiser of the birthright
[1:37:19] because he wants himself more than he
[1:37:21] wants the
[1:37:24] birthright we've prayed those prayers
[1:37:26] I've prayed those prayers why God why
[1:37:28] didn't you stop me why did you let this
[1:37:30] happen why didn't
[1:37:33] you God could easily turn around and say
[1:37:36] why didn't you obey
[1:37:39] me why didn't you deny
[1:37:41] yourself why didn't you surrender did I
[1:37:44] not give you the example did I not
[1:37:46] preach it through the prophet did I not
[1:37:47] give you the scriptures did I not show
[1:37:49] you all through the Bible
[1:37:54] amen I don't want to keep accusing God
[1:37:58] in my own
[1:38:01] failure there's one I want to accuse and
[1:38:03] it's this flesh body I live in that's
[1:38:06] the
[1:38:07] culprit and I want that to some come
[1:38:09] subject to the word let's go to
[1:38:12] Philippians chapter
[1:38:20] 3
[1:38:23] Philippians chapter
[1:38:28] 3 verse
[1:38:33] 13 Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:38:36] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:38:38] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:38:39] and reaching forth into those things
[1:38:41] which are before I press toward the mark
[1:38:44] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:38:47] in Christ
[1:38:49] Jesus I want to press
[1:38:52] friends turn to one more place in
[1:38:54] Matthew
[1:39:10] 16 Matthew
[1:39:14] 16:24 then said Jesus unto his disciples
[1:39:18] If any man will come after me let him
[1:39:20] deny him himself and take up his cross
[1:39:22] and follow me for whosoever will save
[1:39:25] his life shall lose it and whosoever
[1:39:28] will lose his life for my sake shall
[1:39:31] find
[1:39:31] it Esau tried to save his
[1:39:35] life he lost the birthright he lost his
[1:39:39] chance at eternal
[1:39:41] life I would rather lose my natural life
[1:39:45] and keep my real
[1:39:48] life how many of you want to rule in r
[1:39:51] with him for a thousand
[1:39:52] years well you got a difficult task
[1:39:55] ahead of you because if you're going to
[1:39:58] qualify for that and have the character
[1:40:00] and have the understanding and have the
[1:40:02] discernment to rule and Reign for a
[1:40:04] thousand years you're going to have to
[1:40:06] start practicing on this clump of dirt
[1:40:08] right
[1:40:09] now and boy I'm telling you Esau is
[1:40:12] slippery
[1:40:14] sometimes he's
[1:40:16] religious sometimes he's a good boy but
[1:40:18] he doesn't love that word
[1:40:21] and he's got to be brought subject to
[1:40:24] the
[1:40:27] word sometimes I
[1:40:29] think it's detrimental to have a good
[1:40:34] disposition the more you think about it
[1:40:36] when you really start to think about it
[1:40:38] you've seen different people different
[1:40:40] ones grow up and just naturally they
[1:40:42] just naturally are
[1:40:44] compliant they just naturally follow the
[1:40:46] rules and they're Pleasant and they're
[1:40:48] nice and they smile everybody likes them
[1:40:50] and then once in a while you have this
[1:40:52] child that's born and they're just
[1:40:54] opposite everything from birth not
[1:40:58] compliant they're willful they're
[1:41:00] determined
[1:41:02] and I think when it comes time for
[1:41:04] conversion I think the second one has a
[1:41:06] better chance than the first
[1:41:08] one think maybe it was a blessing that
[1:41:10] you can live all your life bumping your
[1:41:12] head falling down and realizing that
[1:41:15] this guy is not my friend rather than
[1:41:17] growing up and thinking this guy's my
[1:41:19] friend he he goes along with the word
[1:41:21] he's pretty
[1:41:23] good that's
[1:41:25] deception it's better to realize this is
[1:41:27] my enemy I don't like him he doesn't
[1:41:30] like me he's trying to stop me from from
[1:41:32] he's trying to stop Jacob from winning
[1:41:34] the race but for forget it flesh you're
[1:41:36] not going to win I'm predestinated to
[1:41:38] win I'm predestinated to be an overcomer
[1:41:41] in this age and I'm going to overcome my
[1:41:43] own flesh my own wrong mind I'm going to
[1:41:46] overcome it all and bring it subject to
[1:41:48] the
[1:41:49] word and may God have Grace on me and
[1:41:53] help me and give me his word and give me
[1:41:55] strength and give me power and may I use
[1:41:57] all the power he's given me to surrender
[1:42:00] and lay myself flat and give myself to
[1:42:02] him again and again and
[1:42:06] again I don't want to show up on the day
[1:42:08] of
[1:42:09] rewards and him say yeah you did okay
[1:42:14] but you just couldn't get that lump of
[1:42:19] Flesh no God help me help me to
[1:42:23] sedo this Philistine
[1:42:25] land for your kingdom amen help me to

[1:42:50] way up
[1:42:51] I have found for myself a lifetime worth
[1:42:54] of
[1:42:55] work in getting this flesh subdued to
[1:42:58] the
[1:42:59] word it's going to take more than my
[1:43:02] willpower it's going to take the spirit
[1:43:03] of God it's going to take the word of
[1:43:05] God but I believe we're in the
[1:43:07] generation that God is going to have a
[1:43:09] people I believe it amen do you believe
[1:43:12] it do you believe what the prophet said
[1:43:14] Do you believe what the word said I
[1:43:16] believe we live in the generation that
[1:43:18] there's going to be a people surrendered
[1:43:20] completely to Christ the word and that
[1:43:23] he is going to have the preeminence in a
[1:43:25] body of Believers I believe that and I
[1:43:28] believe that this old nature is going to
[1:43:30] serve the new
[1:43:32] birth and display Christ and manifest
[1:43:35] the word and stop manifesting its own
[1:43:37] willfulness and its own pride and its
[1:43:41] own I believe it I believe I live in the
[1:43:43] day I believe the anointings here I
[1:43:45] believe the word's been given what's he
[1:43:47] looking he's looking for us to take the
[1:43:48] word and Rule with a rod of of
[1:43:52] iron oh sometimes I think we rule
