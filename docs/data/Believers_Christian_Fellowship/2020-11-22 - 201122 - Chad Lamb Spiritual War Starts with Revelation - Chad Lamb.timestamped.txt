[11:18] [Music]
[11:34] Hallelujah praise be to His holy name
[11:38] it's a pleasure to be with you this
[11:40] morning remember while we're standing
[11:42] let's take our Bibles and turn to First
[11:43] Corinthians chapter 2.
[11:46] we'll get straight into the word
[11:48] I so appreciate the atmosphere
[11:51] it's so nice when you can step into an
[11:53] atmosphere where hearts are prepared
[11:55] the Lord is high and lifted up and he's
[11:57] respected and honored
[11:59] let me step into that atmosphere and say
[12:01] God take control amen feed your sheep
[12:05] and that's let's look here before we
[12:07] read I just want to let everybody know
[12:09] that our brother Steve smart his father
[12:11] passed away on Thursday of complications
[12:14] that resulted from coven 19. so he'd
[12:17] appreciate your prayers if you just pray
[12:18] for him and and he's planning his
[12:21] father's funeral now all the
[12:23] responsibilities falling on him as the
[12:24] oldest son so I know he'd appreciate
[12:26] your prayers and your thoughts your
[12:28] words of encouragement for him there'll
[12:30] be a funeral this coming Saturday but
[12:31] the details will follow we'll make an
[12:33] announcement on Wednesday and let you
[12:35] know when that will be
[12:37] so let's uh let's look here where we're
[12:39] at in First Corinthians chapter two
[12:41] verse 6.
[12:46] I said
[12:47] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[12:49] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[12:52] this world nor the prince of this world
[12:55] that come to not but we speak the wisdom
[12:57] of God in a mystery even the hidden
[13:00] wisdom which God ordained before the
[13:02] world unto our Glory
[13:04] which none of the princes of this world
[13:06] knew for had they known it they would
[13:08] not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but
[13:11] as it is written I have not seen nor ear
[13:13] heard neither hath entered into the
[13:15] heart of man the things which God hath
[13:17] prepared for them that love him
[13:19] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[13:21] his spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[13:23] things yea the Deep things of God for
[13:26] what men know what the things of man say
[13:28] the spirit of man which is in him even
[13:30] so the things of God knoweth no man but
[13:33] the spirit of God now we have received
[13:36] not the spirit of the world but the
[13:37] spirit which is of god that we might
[13:39] know the things that are freely given to
[13:41] us of God which things also we speak not
[13:45] in the world in in Words which man's
[13:47] Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[13:49] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[13:52] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[13:55] not the things of the spirit of God for
[13:57] their foolishness unto him neither can
[13:59] he know them because they are
[14:01] spiritually discerned
[14:04] let's bow our heads
[14:06] Lord Jesus we thank you Father for the
[14:09] privilege Lord to live in this hour
[14:11] Lord to be called out by a prophetic
[14:15] Ministry of voice in this day that's
[14:16] called us Lord out of laodicea the Lord
[14:19] called us out a denominationalism out of
[14:22] Darkness into light
[14:24] Lord and we just thank you for the
[14:26] privilege Lord of being here at this
[14:28] time when you're doing this work
[14:30] God we want to see more clearly than
[14:32] we've ever seen before we pray you call
[14:35] to us higher to come up higher and
[14:37] higher and higher as you revealed to us
[14:39] your word
[14:40] it may as we fly higher Lord may we see
[14:42] more clearly all around us and
[14:44] understand what it is you're doing in
[14:46] this day and may Lord we trust in you
[14:49] and have faith in what you're doing all
[14:51] around us and through us and amongst us
[14:53] and may all that we do in response be
[14:55] pleasing unto you every word that we
[14:57] would say all of our actions may they be
[14:59] pleasing to you Lord God I pray to that
[15:02] preeminence speak your word to us
[15:03] tonight break the bread of life this
[15:05] morning I mean Lord break it to us and
[15:08] feed us your sheep Dawn in Jesus
[15:10] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[15:13] you can be seated
[15:18] amen
[15:19] so
[15:21] this morning I'd like to take for a text
[15:24] if we could just give a title of
[15:27] spiritual war starts with revelation
[15:30] I'm going to read a quote that'll
[15:32] explain this but spiritual war starts
[15:34] with revelation
[15:36] and and I'm hoping that God will just
[15:39] bring out of my lips what he's put into
[15:42] my heart amen and that he'll do the
[15:44] he'll connect all the dots in your heart
[15:46] the pieces that maybe I leave off or not
[15:48] able to explain my God just been dealing
[15:51] with me in this way and and the context
[15:54] for the context I want to take out of
[15:56] this quote in the first seal brother man
[15:59] says now notice it's to be revealed when
[16:01] the lamb leaves his intercessory place
[16:03] from the father now that's Revelations
[16:06] 5.
[16:07] excuse me now he takes the book of seals
[16:10] the book of seals or a book of sealed
[16:12] with seals break them and shows them at
[16:15] the End of the Age now after the
[16:17] intercessory is over the church ages is
[16:19] done finished up he comes in the first
[16:21] stage he come in the first stage
[16:22] Ephesians age revealed sent the
[16:25] messenger now what happened as we go
[16:27] along so he's going to start explaining
[16:29] what's been happening to the church ages
[16:31] from the first stage on up
[16:34] I don't want to tell you too I'm still
[16:36] struggling with golfing but I don't care
[16:39] so I hope that it doesn't bother you
[16:41] I'll cough I'll clear my throat and God
[16:44] will loosen everything up in a few
[16:45] minutes and we'll be Off to the Races
[16:47] amen but you know I'm not gonna let the
[16:49] devil hinder the word of God with a
[16:52] tickle in the throat or an irritation in
[16:54] the lungs because we don't care
[16:57] one thing I've learned uh
[17:01] one thing I've learned is the devil
[17:03] wants attention
[17:06] and I don't care
[17:08] men I don't care that I'm coughing it
[17:09] doesn't bother me
[17:11] what I care about is preaching the word
[17:13] of God Amen hearing the word living the
[17:15] word and I just don't care it'll take
[17:17] care of itself God will take care of it
[17:19] we have promises no word all I have to
[17:21] do is focus on what he's given me to do
[17:23] so you focus all focus and don't let the
[17:25] devil distract either one of us
[17:28] going on in this quote in the first seal
[17:29] he says here's the plan of it the first
[17:31] thing happens there's an announcement in
[17:33] the heavens first what happened a seal
[17:36] is open what is that a mystery is
[17:38] unfolded and when a mystery unfolds then
[17:41] a trumpet sounds it declares a war
[17:45] or a plague Falls and a church age
[17:48] opened see what is the war part the
[17:51] angel of the church catches the mystery
[17:53] of God not fully yet revealed but when
[17:55] he does he catches this mystery of God
[17:57] and then he goes forth to the people
[17:59] after the mystery has been given to him
[18:01] Goes Forth to the people what does he do
[18:04] out there he begins to Proclaim that
[18:06] message and what does it start a war a
[18:09] spiritual war
[18:11] so he's going to the churches from the
[18:13] first age on Amen when that church-aged
[18:15] messenger would catch a mystery not yet
[18:18] fully revealed but he would catch a
[18:20] mystery in the opening of it as it's
[18:22] beginning to unfold and he would go
[18:24] forth proclaiming that he was sounding a
[18:26] trumpet amen
[18:28] and when he would Proclaim that he
[18:29] sounded trumpet and a trumpet always is
[18:32] a gathering to war remember him teaches
[18:34] that when he sound a trumpet it's a
[18:36] gathering it's a trumpets are for
[18:37] Gathering and this trumpet sound is
[18:39] gathering for war and he starts out with
[18:42] the truth and I'll read this just again
[18:44] so we catch what brother REM says
[18:46] he catches this mystery of God then he
[18:48] goes forth to the people goes forth to
[18:51] the people what does he do out there he
[18:52] begins to proclaim the message and what
[18:55] does this start a war a spiritual war
[18:57] and that's why I said spiritual war
[18:59] starts with revelation
[19:02] and it's important to note that and I
[19:04] want to I want to hold on to that that
[19:06] spiritual war starts with Revelation as
[19:08] as we move through this thought here and
[19:11] then God takes his messenger with the
[19:13] elect of that age and lays them away
[19:15] asleep and then he drops a plague upon
[19:17] them who rejected him a temporary
[19:19] judgment and then after that it's over
[19:21] then he goes on and they and they
[19:23] denominate and bring in denominations
[19:25] and start off with that man's work like
[19:27] of Wesley and all the rest of them and
[19:28] then it gets all on a scrapple again and
[19:31] then another mystery comes forth then
[19:33] what happens another messenger arrives
[19:35] on the earth for a church age see then
[19:37] when he arrives the trumpet sounds he
[19:39] declares war see and then what happens
[19:42] finally then he's caught away and then
[19:45] when he's laid away then the plague
[19:47] Falls destroys them spiritual death hits
[19:49] the church and she's gone that group
[19:51] then he goes on to another one
[19:55] oh it's a great plan until it comes to
[19:58] this last angel now he has no certain
[20:01] mystery but he gathers up all that's
[20:03] been lost in them other ages all the
[20:05] truth that wasn't truly revealed yet as
[20:08] the Revelation come then he reveals
[20:11] those things in his day if you want to
[20:13] read it there it is revelation 10 1
[20:15] about 4 you'll get it all right takes
[20:18] the book of seals and breaks them and
[20:19] shows the seventh angel for this alone
[20:22] the mystery of God the mysteries of God
[20:25] is the ministry of the seventh angel now
[20:27] we just come through the church ages
[20:29] with even history proved that it's the
[20:31] Angel's message of the seventh Church
[20:33] all right Reveals All the Mysteries
[20:35] that's been in the past and all the
[20:37] things in the past Revelations 10 1-7
[20:39] that's to be now remember in the days of
[20:42] the seventh angel he'll sounding forth
[20:44] blasting forth the gospel trumpet he is
[20:47] to finish all the mysteries of God
[20:50] so he shows us the pattern the pattern
[20:53] is that there'll be uh there'll be a
[20:56] mystery that's to be revealed he says a
[20:58] seal opens a Mysteries give out hey
[21:01] thank you brother praise God I can go
[21:04] for a long time now
[21:09] uh seal is open a Mysteries give out
[21:13] all right
[21:15] and the angel of the age catches that
[21:17] mystery and he goes to Proclaim it and
[21:19] as he goes to Proclaim it he's blasting
[21:21] out a gospel trumpet
[21:24] and in blasting out that gospel trumpet
[21:26] what is he doing he breaks down
[21:28] spiritual war he's declaring war he's
[21:30] Gathering the elect and what's the
[21:32] gospel Trump are doing Gathering the
[21:34] elect and once he's Gathering the elect
[21:35] for for spiritual warfare and that means
[21:38] the warfare that's taking on all around
[21:41] is always battling around the revealed
[21:44] Truth for the day
[21:46] that's where the battle is always taking
[21:48] place that's where the sounding of the
[21:50] trumpet is until it comes to this last
[21:52] Angel and in this last Angel he doesn't
[21:54] have any one certain truth he's
[21:56] Gathering up all the truths all that's
[21:58] been left off all the fragments and
[22:00] pieces and he's putting them together
[22:01] for one great revelation of the
[22:04] mysteries of God Amen and he reveals
[22:06] Christ as the mystery of God revealed
[22:08] amen and what does he do he blasts forth
[22:10] the trumpet want trumpet it would be the
[22:12] final gospel trumpet or the seventh
[22:14] gospel trumpet
[22:16] and in the seventh days that last gospel
[22:19] trumpet amen if and I just think about
[22:21] this if down Through the Ages Every new
[22:25] uh a revelation that's released
[22:27] everything that's come through the
[22:28] prophet the the messenger's message in
[22:30] each age would declare a spiritual war
[22:32] what kind of War would you expect when
[22:35] they're all gathered up into one and one
[22:37] last trumpet is blast I would say it
[22:40] would be the final war the final battle
[22:42] the final showdown for the Gentile bride
[22:46] if if each one of those pieces amen
[22:48] coming down broke out in spiritual war
[22:51] what will happen when he brings all the
[22:53] pieces together and delivers them in one
[22:55] great Revelation and one great mystery
[22:58] what kind of battle do you think will
[23:00] ensue them
[23:01] and what do we think the battle is about
[23:04] praise God that's what we want to talk
[23:06] about today
[23:10] in the in the church age book Brothers
[23:13] says now remember this Christ in the
[23:16] true church is a continuation of the
[23:18] book of Acts but the Book of Revelation
[23:20] shows how the Antichrist Spirit would
[23:22] come into the church and defile it make
[23:24] it lukewarm formal powerless it exposes
[23:27] Satan revealing his Works attempted
[23:30] destruction of God's people and the
[23:32] discrediting of God's word so we've
[23:34] mentioned this before but it's worth
[23:35] noting and keeping in your mind amen the
[23:38] the uh
[23:40] that exposes Satan revealing his works
[23:44] so what's his works
[23:47] what the devil is trying to do his works
[23:51] is the attempted destruction of God's
[23:53] people
[23:54] and the discrediting of God's word
[23:58] so if you want to know what the devil's
[24:00] doing this is what he's doing he's
[24:02] attempting the destruction of God's
[24:04] people and the discrediting of God's
[24:06] word
[24:07] because if we get if we can just uh
[24:13] let the prophet tell us what we need to
[24:16] know and kick out all human reasoning
[24:18] we'll find ourselves not fighting
[24:21] battles that have nothing to do with
[24:22] what the real Warfare is over
[24:25] will not be chasing things like
[24:27] denominational Believers or chasing
[24:29] things I mean they want to they want to
[24:31] fight uh about civil liberties they want
[24:34] to fight about abortion and all of that
[24:36] and there's nothing wrong with the
[24:38] causes there's nothing wrong with the
[24:39] truth that they're declaring abortions
[24:41] of sin it's evil it's wickedness it
[24:43] should be withstood and preached against
[24:45] I'm not I'm not I'm not diminishing the
[24:49] need for that but what I'm saying is if
[24:51] you put all your effort in that and
[24:53] you're fighting bars and you're fighting
[24:54] homosexual marriage and you're fighting
[24:56] all this you're you're not even where
[24:58] the Battleground is amen you're off in
[25:01] the weed somewhere totally distracted by
[25:03] a diversion tactic of the devil and not
[25:06] even really fighting the real issue the
[25:08] real issue is he's trying to destroy
[25:10] God's people and discredit God's word
[25:11] and what word is he trying to discredit
[25:14] the one that came with the trumpet blast
[25:16] the word that opened in this day amen
[25:18] that's bringing a revelation to the
[25:20] people amen and that's where the attack
[25:22] comes
[25:24] that's where the devil's working Amen
[25:26] brother man said he's not working in the
[25:28] bar room or the house of prostitution he
[25:30] said that's already on his grounds
[25:32] that's not where he's fighting
[25:34] that's not his works that's not where
[25:35] he's working where's he's working
[25:37] wherever the truth is proclaimed is
[25:39] where he's working
[25:43] and so if we don't if we don't pay
[25:47] attention to what the prophet's telling
[25:49] us we can so easily get caught up in the
[25:51] diversion tactics
[25:54] and we're not fighting the good fight of
[25:56] Faith because we're beating the air
[25:59] because these things are all symptoms of
[26:01] a greater problem amen and you can start
[26:03] chasing symptoms all you want but you
[26:05] got to get down to the root of the
[26:06] problem and the root of the problem is
[26:08] the people have left Christ
[26:11] and Christ is the word and he's the word
[26:14] made manifest in your day and by the
[26:16] rejection of Christ now all of these
[26:19] things are outcroppings of the main
[26:21] disease and the main disease is unbelief
[26:25] unbelief in what unbelief in the word in
[26:28] what word in the word for your day
[26:30] [Applause]
[26:35] I drank that so brother Jeremy's efforts
[26:38] would be worth something it wasn't
[26:40] wasted my brother
[26:43] you know
[26:44] that we've been so blessed to have a
[26:46] prophet in our day so that we don't get
[26:49] caught up in our own thinking and go
[26:50] chasing our towns and and distracted by
[26:53] things that that will never get us
[26:55] anywhere and we'll never accomplish
[26:56] anything
[26:58] uh if you don't fix the root problem it
[27:02] doesn't matter how much legislation you
[27:04] push for how many signs you put in your
[27:06] yard or how many rallies you attend amen
[27:08] even if you're able to diminish in a
[27:11] certain State a certain uh a certain
[27:13] level of abortion
[27:16] let's just say are a certain
[27:18] preservation of marriage
[27:24] it won't be any time that'll pop up
[27:26] worse than it was
[27:28] so you may win a temporary Victory and
[27:30] maybe a minor suppression here A minor
[27:33] suppression there and that's not a bad
[27:35] thing I'm not condemning that because
[27:37] I'm I'm against it all
[27:40] but you realize after a while all of
[27:43] your effort you're just getting tired
[27:45] you're just spinning your wheels because
[27:48] it's no real Victory it's no real
[27:50] reversal amen because the problem is the
[27:53] rejection of Christ
[27:55] the problem that brother Ben said is in
[27:57] the pulpits
[27:59] because they quit preaching Christ they
[28:02] quit preaching the word and they started
[28:04] preaching a historical Jesus and quit
[28:06] preaching Jesus of today
[28:10] and I just want to say it this way I I
[28:13] you know I love you guys
[28:15] you love me and I love you you know me I
[28:17] know you but but I say things and
[28:19] sometimes they come across sharp I don't
[28:21] mean them real sharp I just this is
[28:23] what's in my heart amen a historical
[28:25] Jesus amen if you believe if you're
[28:28] holding fast to only the historical part
[28:31] of the Gospel
[28:33] the historical part of the Gospel
[28:36] oh
[28:37] I want to say this right
[28:40] the historical part of the Gospel
[28:43] was the part that overcame in that day
[28:47] and it's the truth
[28:49] it's an absolute truth and never should
[28:52] be rejected
[28:53] it should be believed today and stood
[28:55] upon today
[28:58] but the the victory today comes through
[29:02] the revealed word of today because God
[29:05] has portioned his word out amen for each
[29:08] day to make sure that when the enemy
[29:10] comes like a flood he has a standard to
[29:12] raise against it and that standard is
[29:13] the revelation of the word
[29:16] and so that's why with with only faith
[29:19] in a historical gospel or historical
[29:21] Jesus and not receiving the present day
[29:25] Jesus you'll never have strength to
[29:27] overcome the present day spiritual war
[29:30] because this present-day spiritual war
[29:32] is all about the revelation of the word
[29:36] it's not about amen what happened two
[29:39] thousand years ago that's included in
[29:41] the word today
[29:43] that's included in all of the word is
[29:46] included today
[29:48] but it's the rejection of the word today
[29:50] it's the rejection of Jesus Christ's
[29:53] present tense that's causing all the
[29:55] other problems
[29:57] and so by the grace of God he's given us
[30:00] a prophet so that we can recognize
[30:02] we could recognize where the battle is
[30:06] and what the battle's over and what we
[30:09] should be doing
[30:13] all right so the I'm gonna keep going in
[30:16] the church age book here
[30:21] the devil to reveal his Works to Satan's
[30:24] works his attempted destruction of God's
[30:26] people and the discrediting of God's
[30:28] word
[30:30] right down to the time he has cast into
[30:32] the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[30:35] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[30:37] people get the true revelation of the
[30:39] true church and what she is what she
[30:43] stands for and that she can do the
[30:45] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[30:48] Army
[30:50] if they get a true
[30:58] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[31:00] her he will be as definitely thwarted
[31:02] today as when Christ withstood his every
[31:04] effort to gain power over him in the
[31:06] desert
[31:07] yes Satan hates revelation
[31:13] but we love it
[31:16] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[31:19] with true Revelation in our lives the
[31:21] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[31:24] but we will prevail over them
[31:29] this
[31:31] these germs
[31:34] how amen is the armies of hell is the
[31:37] Fortress of hell it shall not Prevail
[31:39] over us but we shall Prevail over them
[31:42] how will I Prevail in this day how will
[31:44] I overcome how will I keep from the
[31:47] Gates of Hell overcoming me but I shall
[31:49] overcome them by true Revelation is the
[31:51] only way
[31:52] Victory only comes by true Revelation in
[31:55] this day true revelation of the true
[31:57] church and what she is true revelation
[31:59] of the two Spirits within the framework
[32:00] of the Christian Church these these
[32:02] Revelations are what give us power over
[32:05] the gates of hell
[32:07] so I say the the most important thing in
[32:11] our life is true revelation
[32:19] let's turn together to Genesis
[32:21] I want to look at a couple things as we
[32:24] explore this thought
[32:33] Genesis chapter 3.
[32:43] in Genesis 3 verse 1.
[32:47] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[32:49] beast of the field which the Lord God
[32:51] had made
[32:52] and he said unto the woman yeah God said
[32:55] You shall eat of every tree of guard of
[32:57] the garden and the woman said unto the
[32:58] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[33:00] Trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[33:02] the tree which is in the midst of the
[33:04] garden God has said You shall not eat of
[33:06] it neither shall you touch it lest you
[33:08] die
[33:09] and the servant said unto the woman ye
[33:11] shall not surely die for God doesn't
[33:13] know that in the day you eat thereof
[33:16] then your eyes shall be open and you
[33:18] shall be as God's knowing good and evil
[33:20] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[33:22] good for food and that it was pleasant
[33:24] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[33:26] make one wise she took of the fruit
[33:28] thereof and did eat and gave also unto
[33:30] her husband with her and he did eat
[33:32] and the eyes of them both were open and
[33:34] they knew that they were naked and they
[33:36] sewed fig leaves together and made
[33:38] themselves aprons
[33:40] now the reason I go to this uh
[33:43] scriptures I just want to point out a
[33:46] principle that we see here that still
[33:48] applies today
[33:50] and that principle is this
[33:52] that information
[33:54] without revelation
[33:57] will lead to deception
[34:00] I'll say that a couple times so you
[34:02] catch and I'll explain my meaning
[34:04] information without revelation will lead
[34:08] to deception
[34:10] because Eve had the information
[34:13] she was told what not to do she was
[34:16] given instructions she had the word but
[34:20] it's obvious she had no Revelation on
[34:22] that word because if she had Revelation
[34:24] on that word she would have never
[34:26] compromised on the word
[34:28] amen because we know this is true that
[34:31] she had no Revelation because she was
[34:33] beguiled by the devil and when you have
[34:35] a revelation you're not beguiled because
[34:37] you understand
[34:39] so she didn't have understanding what
[34:41] she had was information and information
[34:43] without revelation will lead to
[34:47] deception
[34:49] amen and this is true today
[34:53] think about it friends we've got we've
[34:56] got more Bibles more Bible translations
[34:58] more Bible commentaries more Bible
[34:59] schools more Bible knowledge is
[35:02] available than there's ever been where
[35:04] you can read the Greek you can read the
[35:06] Hebrew you can read I mean you can read
[35:08] in all kinds of forms and Fashions but
[35:10] information without revelation will lead
[35:12] to deception
[35:14] because that's what that's what's
[35:16] happening in all the denominational
[35:18] world they're going into deception
[35:20] because they have information with no
[35:22] revelation
[35:23] and because there's no Revelation the
[35:26] devil can manipulate the information
[35:31] amen I tell you friends you can talk to
[35:33] somebody if you've got somebody who
[35:35] really knows their Bible and really has
[35:37] studied their Bible and you know they're
[35:40] really they're not just a they're not
[35:41] just a Sunday only Christian but
[35:44] somebody who really knows their Bible
[35:45] and you begin to sit down and talk to
[35:47] them you'll realize that for for you
[35:50] bring a scripture they'll bring a
[35:51] scripture
[35:52] scripture in scripture scripture in
[35:54] scripture you can do it for
[35:55] trinitarianism you can do it you know uh
[35:58] whatever you bring scripture and you can
[36:00] have a discussion
[36:02] for 30 minutes 40 minutes an hour and in
[36:06] that discussion you can never go to an
[36:08] agreement come to an agreement but you
[36:10] can be speaking the scriptures the
[36:12] entire time
[36:14] they can be going from verse to verse
[36:15] and you're going from verse to verse
[36:17] amen but information without revelation
[36:20] will lead to deception
[36:23] because the devil has always taken the
[36:26] information that is given to the
[36:28] children of God Amen and he's come in
[36:30] and he's perverted that and twisted it
[36:32] with reasonings and human thinking and
[36:34] humanism amen and he's perverted the
[36:37] information and he's brought deception
[36:40] age after age after age after age
[36:46] and so Eve doesn't have a revelation
[36:49] she's beguiled she's deceived she
[36:51] thought she was doing right
[36:53] she didn't have the revelation
[36:56] but but let's go on
[36:59] to chapter four
[37:04] chapter four verse 3.
[37:09] and Adam knew Eve his wife and also
[37:12] conceived in Bear cane and said I have
[37:13] gotten the man from the Lord and and she
[37:16] Bears brother Abel and Abel was a keeper
[37:18] of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the
[37:19] ground and in process of time it came to
[37:22] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[37:23] the ground an offering
[37:25] unto the Lord and Abel also he brought
[37:28] up the first things of his flock and the
[37:30] fact thereof and the Lord had respect
[37:32] unto Abel into his offering but unto
[37:34] Cain into his offering he had not
[37:36] respect
[37:37] and Cain was very Roth
[37:40] in his countenance fell
[37:42] here we have a a situation where we
[37:45] start to see Revelation come on the
[37:48] scene
[37:49] brother man tells us and we read in
[37:51] Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 4 I'll just recite
[37:54] this by faith Abel offered unto God a
[37:56] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[37:58] which he obtained witness that he was
[38:00] righteous
[38:02] God testifying of his gifts and by it he
[38:05] being dead yes speaketh
[38:08] Able by faith Brethren said faith is a
[38:10] revelation amen faith is a revelation
[38:12] and by Revelation Abel offered a more
[38:15] excellent sacrifice and you know I made
[38:18] this I made this statement that uh
[38:21] information without revelation will lead
[38:23] to deception
[38:25] but now think about this
[38:27] revelation
[38:30] right revelation will bring revelation
[38:34] will bring the truth
[38:36] with missing information
[38:41] right God didn't come down until Abel
[38:44] don't offer this and offer that
[38:46] we have no record of God saying the only
[38:49] thing that will be acceptable to me is a
[38:51] lamb don't offer fruits don't offer this
[38:53] but somehow without all the information
[38:56] Abel was able to catch Revelation and in
[39:00] that Revelation he was able to act in a
[39:02] way that was pleasing to God and by
[39:05] Faith by Revelation he caught the
[39:08] mystery he caught the understanding that
[39:11] wasn't always given out in the detailed
[39:13] information
[39:16] like I've heard people before say you
[39:19] know along these lines it's not exact
[39:21] quote but along the lines I wish brother
[39:23] Branham would have explained it more
[39:25] clearly
[39:27] I wish it wasn't fragmented or broke I
[39:29] wish I wish that we didn't have to
[39:31] battle over was it this or that or the
[39:34] seeming discrepancies or the unclarity
[39:36] or or the the way in which he presented
[39:38] it I wish that it was like on PowerPoint
[39:41] and I wish that he had stayed in his
[39:44] line of thinking and never jumped around
[39:45] like they've never said all those words
[39:48] but they said as much as that
[39:50] I wish it was clear and and I'll tell
[39:52] you friends it doesn't matter how clear
[39:55] he would have made it and how clearly he
[39:57] would have sat on table and explain it
[39:58] to you without Revelation it would have
[40:00] still brought deception
[40:02] because information without revelation
[40:04] will bring deception
[40:07] but brother Brandon would preach in such
[40:09] a way he would say I hope you're
[40:10] catching my meaning without me coming
[40:12] right out and saying it wait what's it
[40:15] going to take what is it going to take
[40:17] to overcome in this day to win this
[40:19] spiritual war I mean what's it going to
[40:21] take is whatever Abel had whatever Abel
[40:24] had from God where he was without
[40:25] detailed information able to catch the
[40:28] right thought of God and offer the right
[40:30] sacrifice that would be pleasing to God
[40:32] that God would then turn around and say
[40:34] that testifies that he is righteous
[40:38] his righteousness was on display because
[40:40] of his Revelation and without the
[40:43] detailed information he caught the
[40:45] mystery he understood what was needed he
[40:47] offered the he gave the right action he
[40:49] offered the right sacrifice and God
[40:52] testified that he is righteous
[40:55] Cain didn't catch anything
[40:59] I mean I shouldn't say he didn't catch
[41:01] anything Kane caught a lot
[41:03] Kane caught the fact that God was a true
[41:05] God and one God
[41:07] he was worthy of worship and Cain wanted
[41:11] to worship God because he knew there was
[41:13] one true God and that God was worthy to
[41:15] be worshiped
[41:16] Cain knew a lot can't had information
[41:19] amen Cain brother Venom says those two
[41:22] boys were raised in the same home with
[41:24] the same spiritual instruction
[41:26] they saw the same things they had heard
[41:29] the same explanations they had heard the
[41:31] same stories they had watched the same
[41:33] performance and actions of of Adam and
[41:36] Eve
[41:37] but one caught the mystery and the other
[41:40] one amen went about doing what he
[41:44] thought was best based off all the
[41:46] information that he had
[41:51] amen and for us you know if we if take
[41:56] away all our Bible Understanding
[42:00] and just go back to Cain and Abel and
[42:03] just watch these two boys work watch
[42:05] these two men offer their sacrifice and
[42:08] and you know go to them and interview
[42:10] them and say uh you know what sacrifice
[42:12] did God tell you to bring and he said
[42:14] well God never told us what to bring
[42:18] well well what makes you want to worship
[42:20] well I know he's God and I I know he
[42:22] deserves worship and and I know this and
[42:24] I know that and but I but what does he
[42:26] want I don't know but but but Cain says
[42:29] well I think what I'm going to do is I'm
[42:30] just going to do the very best that I
[42:32] can do
[42:33] because I don't know what else I'm going
[42:35] to do the very best that I can do and in
[42:37] the very best that I can do I'm going to
[42:39] you know plant my vegetables I'm going
[42:41] to build an altar I'm gonna do I'm gonna
[42:43] do whatever I can do because he hasn't
[42:45] told me
[42:48] and Abel you interview Abel and yes Abel
[42:51] Abel what are you going to do Abel says
[42:52] I'm not really sure yet I don't know
[42:55] are you going are you working at it
[42:56] already not not really
[42:59] what have you started doing I haven't
[43:01] really started doing anything
[43:03] and you're like but but you know there's
[43:06] one true God and you know he's worthy to
[43:08] be worshiped and you know you must bring
[43:09] us yes yes I know all of that's true
[43:11] what are you going to bring I don't know
[43:13] what are you going to do about it I
[43:15] don't know when are you going to get
[43:16] started I don't know
[43:19] so if you just as a human being start
[43:21] looking at this thing without spiritual
[43:23] understanding I mean none of us in our
[43:26] Earthly existence in our human mind none
[43:28] of us would fault game
[43:30] none of us would look at Cain and say
[43:32] Cain you know because nobody told him
[43:36] but there was something told there was
[43:39] something on display there was something
[43:41] there there was a mystery that laid out
[43:43] and maybe it was between the lines that
[43:45] he had to read maybe he wasn't said
[43:47] right out but there was something laying
[43:49] there that Abel had the capacity to
[43:52] catch and when he caught it amen when he
[43:54] caught it and he did what God wanted
[43:56] what God desired it proved that he was
[43:59] righteous
[44:02] then I wish I just had all the
[44:03] information I wish it was just laid out
[44:05] I I said I don't care if I have all the
[44:07] information and all the information I
[44:08] just want revelation amen I want a heart
[44:10] that can receive Revelation from God and
[44:13] I want the spirit of God that can
[44:14] Quicken something inside of me because
[44:16] if I've got missing Revelation missing
[44:19] books missing pieces amen the revelation
[44:21] will peace what's there together the
[44:24] right way and the sacrifice that I offer
[44:26] will be pleasing to my father because I
[44:28] worship in spirit and in truth
[44:31] by what by revelation
[44:37] let's look at a little further now verse
[44:39] six
[44:41] and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou
[44:43] wrath and why is thy countenance Fallen
[44:46] if thou do as well shall thou not be
[44:48] accepted and if thou doest not well send
[44:51] life at the door and unto thee shall be
[44:53] his desire and thou shalt rule over him
[44:55] and Cain talked with Abel his brother
[44:57] and it came to pass when they were in
[45:00] the field that Cain rose up against Abel
[45:02] his brother and slew him
[45:06] now we know this story super well so
[45:09] there's nothing new that I'm telling you
[45:11] here but
[45:12] you realize that Cain with no capacity
[45:15] to receive revelation
[45:18] even when he got the correct information
[45:25] God said now listen why is your count
[45:29] has fallen why are you Roth this is God
[45:31] talking to him now
[45:33] why are you upset why are you angry
[45:36] listen to what I'm telling you just do
[45:39] what Abel did just just repeat just copy
[45:42] paste
[45:43] just do what Abel did and want to be
[45:47] well with you
[45:48] and you see a fundamental uh principle
[45:52] right out of the Book of Genesis that
[45:55] even even with the correct information
[45:58] without Revelation it'll lead to
[46:01] deception
[46:03] and now Cain is now guilty of
[46:07] self-deception because now he has the
[46:09] Revelation and under the Revelation he
[46:12] cannot he has nothing in him he has no
[46:14] capacity to receive it even though Jesus
[46:17] said repeat step one step two step three
[46:21] God has told him just do this one two
[46:23] three everything will be fine but he has
[46:26] no capacity in himself to to receive it
[46:28] but what he does instead of just doing
[46:30] what God said he goes and has a
[46:32] conversation with Abel and we know that
[46:35] Abel has the correct revelation
[46:37] we know that Abel knows why he offered a
[46:40] lamb
[46:42] he knows why it had to be blood the
[46:44] prophet explains all this to us and he
[46:46] knows why it's got to be blood why it
[46:48] had to be a lamb and and now they have a
[46:51] conversation and this conversation so
[46:54] infuriates Cain that Cain now kills
[46:58] Abel
[47:01] and he said why
[47:03] what could he have done
[47:05] the only thing I know that he could done
[47:07] is but tell him the reason for his
[47:08] revelation
[47:11] but but you realize that even after Cain
[47:14] or the discussion in Abel explaining
[47:16] whatever he explained to Cain
[47:19] instead of Cain being humble repentant
[47:24] instead of Cain going back and just
[47:26] doing what God Said
[47:29] Cain
[47:31] so wanted his own lie to be true
[47:37] that he had to stop any voice
[47:41] that opposed his lie
[47:46] see all the way back in Genesis God
[47:48] tells us what we're going to be dealing
[47:50] with today
[47:52] same Spirits it's the same things that
[47:54] are happening today
[47:57] let's go to John chapter 8.
[48:10] John chapter 8 verse 39.
[48:23] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[48:25] is our father
[48:26] Jesus saith unto them
[48:28] if you were Abraham's children you would
[48:30] do the works of Abraham but now you seek
[48:33] to kill me a man that had told you the
[48:35] truth
[48:36] where did we see this before
[48:39] you seek to kill me a man that has told
[48:42] you the truth which I have heard of God
[48:44] this did not Abraham
[48:48] ye do the Deeds of your father then said
[48:50] they to him we be not born of
[48:52] fornication we have one father even God
[48:55] they knew what he was talking about
[48:57] we be not born a fornication we're not
[48:59] of Cain
[49:00] and he says in your actions prove where
[49:03] you came from
[49:04] because you seek to kill me when what
[49:07] have I done I told you the truth
[49:10] Abraham would have never done that but
[49:12] you claim to be children of Abraham you
[49:14] haven't taken the nature of Abraham and
[49:16] you know Jesus is not disputing whether
[49:19] or not they're of the genealogy of
[49:21] Abraham but they're not children of
[49:23] Abraham because the children of Abraham
[49:25] are the children of Promise by faith
[49:28] and he said you are not children of
[49:29] Abraham and they could have showed their
[49:31] pedigree maybe done if it was current
[49:33] day they could have done a DNA test and
[49:35] proved that they had come from Abraham
[49:36] but they were not Abraham's children
[49:38] because Abraham's children were the
[49:40] children of promise
[49:41] by the word so their word children Faith
[49:45] children amen and we are Abraham's
[49:47] children
[49:48] and he said you you you you claim to be
[49:51] Abraham's children but you seek to kill
[49:53] me
[49:54] a man that told you the truth and Jesus
[49:57] ties it right back to the first murder
[49:59] all the way back in the beginning
[50:01] because he's dealing with the same exact
[50:04] Spirit Jesus is there he is the word
[50:07] made flesh he is God in flesh and he is
[50:10] there giving them the correct
[50:12] interpretation of the word and he's
[50:14] giving the people who should receive the
[50:16] word he's giving them the word the
[50:19] people who claim to love the word he's
[50:21] giving them the word the people there's
[50:23] people there that their entire Earthly
[50:26] existence
[50:27] Pharisees Sadducees the high priests
[50:30] their entire Earthly existence is based
[50:33] on the word
[50:34] [Music]
[50:36] they're ministers full-time ministers
[50:38] getting full support
[50:41] their whole life is this word and he
[50:44] comes and he brings him the word but the
[50:46] word that he brings doesn't match the
[50:49] word that they want to be true
[50:54] oh praise God let's look at Matthew 15.
[50:57] I want to read a couple
[51:00] passages right here in the Gospels
[51:16] Matthew 15 and 1.
[51:19] then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees
[51:21] which were of Jerusalem saying why do
[51:24] thy disciples transgress the tradition
[51:26] of the elders for they wash not their
[51:28] hands when they eat bread but he
[51:31] answered and said unto them why do you
[51:33] also transgress the Commandment of God
[51:34] by your tradition
[51:36] for God commanded saying honor thy
[51:38] father and mother and he that curses
[51:40] father and mother let him die to death
[51:42] but you say whoever whoever whosoever
[51:44] shall say to his father or his mother it
[51:46] is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be
[51:48] profited by me and on and on his father
[51:51] or his mother he shall be free thus have
[51:54] you made the Commandment of God of none
[51:56] effect by your tradition ye Hypocrites
[51:59] well did isaiahs prophesy of you saying
[52:02] this people drawth nine to me with their
[52:04] with their mouth and honors me with
[52:06] their lips but their heart is far from
[52:08] me but in vain they do worship me
[52:11] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[52:13] of men
[52:15] Jesus is there laying it straight
[52:17] his disciples are walking through a
[52:19] field on a Sabbath day and they're
[52:21] plucking corn they're taking that corn
[52:24] and they're eating it just taking in
[52:25] hand and eating it
[52:27] and they say why do your disciples do
[52:29] not according to the tradition
[52:32] and Jesus answering them he says why do
[52:36] your Traditions go against the
[52:38] Commandments of God
[52:41] who who cares about the disciples going
[52:43] against the traditions of the fathers
[52:45] the bigger deal is your Traditions going
[52:47] against the Commandment of God
[52:50] and he brings an example to show them
[52:52] but then you think they would receive it
[52:53] they won't even receive it amen that he
[52:56] gives them the Commandment of God that
[52:58] they're violating they don't repent they
[53:00] don't change they go back to wanting to
[53:03] defend the tradition of the fathers
[53:07] nothing changes
[53:10] everything stays the same
[53:13] Jesus told them in John
[53:15] he says do not think that I will accuse
[53:17] you to the father there is one that
[53:19] accuses you even Moses in whom you trust
[53:21] for how do you believe Moses you would
[53:23] have believed me for he wrote of me but
[53:25] if you believe not his writings how
[53:27] shall you believe my words
[53:29] now he's hitting them right where it
[53:31] hurts
[53:33] because he's saying he's saying you
[53:36] claim to believe the message of the hour
[53:39] and you and I'm telling you what Moses
[53:42] wrote but if you won't believe what
[53:44] Moses wrote how will you believe me
[53:47] and there these are the guys that are
[53:49] studying Moses's writings every day
[53:52] they're the ones who have charged with
[53:54] the Scrolls that are writing them
[53:55] scribes who are transcribing them that
[53:58] their whole system is built around the
[54:00] law of Moses and he's telling them there
[54:03] you don't believe Moses if you believe
[54:04] Moses you believe me
[54:08] and they won't move off their tradition
[54:12] let's go to Mark Mark three let's go
[54:14] here together
[54:26] Mark 3 and 1.
[54:28] and he entered in again into the
[54:30] synagogue and there was a man there
[54:31] which had a withered hand and they
[54:34] watched him whether he would heal him on
[54:36] the Sabbath day that they might accuse
[54:38] him
[54:40] and he saith unto the man which had the
[54:42] withered hand stand forth
[54:44] and he saith unto them is it lawful to
[54:46] do good on the Sabbath days or to do
[54:48] evil to save life or to kill
[54:51] and they held their peace
[54:53] well of course they held their peace
[54:55] what are they going to say he says is it
[54:58] better to do good or do evil
[55:00] well I mean what are they going to say
[55:02] is it better to to heal or to kill they
[55:06] have nothing they can say because they
[55:08] know if they say to heal then they
[55:10] cannot condemn him if he heals the man
[55:11] if he says to save life he cannot heal
[55:13] him for saving the man amen but now they
[55:16] know they're in a conundrum because they
[55:17] can't say it's good to do evil or good
[55:19] to kill
[55:21] and Jesus is trying to show him the
[55:24] fallacy of their human thinking
[55:27] he said
[55:30] but they held their peace verse 5 and
[55:32] when he had looked around about on them
[55:34] with anger
[55:36] Jesus got angry
[55:39] he looked at them with anger being Greed
[55:41] for the hardness of their hearts he said
[55:43] unto the man stretch forth thine hand
[55:44] and he stretched it out and his hand was
[55:47] restored whole as the other and the
[55:50] Pharisees went forth and straightway
[55:51] took counsel with the herodians against
[55:53] him how they might destroy him
[55:57] why because he's proclaiming the truth
[56:00] he's sounding the gospel Trump and and
[56:02] sounding the trumpet he's declaring
[56:04] spiritual war and now he's giving a
[56:06] truth and that truth just like in the
[56:08] face of Cain the truth that he's giving
[56:10] amen is contrary to the truth that
[56:13] they've held amen and because he's
[56:15] giving a truth that's contrary to the
[56:17] truth they held they want they want to
[56:19] shut him up because he's a challenging
[56:22] their belief
[56:25] I don't know if you've ever come in
[56:26] contact with a religious spirit I'm sure
[56:28] you are but you get a good church member
[56:30] somebody that goes to church and you
[56:31] start to talk to them and the minute you
[56:33] step on their toe in the scripture I
[56:35] mean all of a sudden it's like you
[56:36] stroke the cat backwards I mean the
[56:38] claws come out the eyes turn red they
[56:40] get super angry and you see that the
[56:42] response is not I mean the response is
[56:44] shocking like you can tell that they
[56:46] themselves are shocked or even some of
[56:47] their family members are shocked
[56:50] because you realize what you're dealing
[56:51] with right there is not a human being
[56:53] what you're dealing with right there is
[56:54] a spirit a religious spirit that does
[56:56] not want you to challenge the status quo
[56:59] does not want you to challenge the false
[57:01] form of worship and expose The Hiding
[57:03] Place of the devil
[57:06] Jesus was walking around daily exposing
[57:10] the devil's hiding place he's hiding in
[57:12] religion he's hiding in the church he's
[57:14] hiding in the priesthood
[57:17] he's hiding in the traditions of the
[57:19] fathers
[57:21] that's where the devil was hiding trying
[57:23] to bring a deception but guess what they
[57:26] had all the information
[57:28] and all the information couldn't stop
[57:30] the deception
[57:33] I think it's remarkable that when Jesus
[57:36] was walking through the Earth and he
[57:38] when he was when he had his ministry on
[57:40] the earth that you see that he got tax
[57:43] collectors and he gone fishermen and he
[57:46] gone uh you know who was attracted to
[57:47] him harlots and and those were
[57:49] sicknesses and and mostly he was
[57:52] widespread rejected by the elites by the
[57:54] by the intellectuals by the by the
[57:57] church officials
[57:59] but he's accepted by those who are
[58:01] ignorant and unlearned
[58:02] because those who who were the church
[58:05] officials and had uh their their
[58:08] reputation based off what they believe
[58:10] in their whole lifestyle they could not
[58:12] afford
[58:13] for what he was saying to be true
[58:17] and it wasn't the men it was the spirit
[58:21] of the devil
[58:23] trying to keep his stronghold in the
[58:25] church
[58:28] that's why God sent us a prophet in this
[58:30] day and that Prophet absolutely blasted
[58:32] the walls out of denominationalism out
[58:35] of church systems out of traditional
[58:37] beliefs Creeds and dogmas and
[58:39] intellectualism of men he actually
[58:41] blasted it away and he sold Master Jesus
[58:44] ministry when Jesus came out Healing The
[58:47] Sick and doing Miracles and wonders amen
[58:49] they all flocked to him and they all
[58:51] thought it was wonderful amen but when
[58:52] he began to start breaking down the word
[58:55] and challenging the system of the day
[58:57] and challenging amen the beliefs of the
[58:59] day amen they turned on him and they
[59:01] wanted to destroy him
[59:02] and here he is he's got a man with a
[59:05] withered hand and here he's going to
[59:07] show I mean he's going to show the sign
[59:08] that God is here the god that created
[59:10] the hand is the god that's going to
[59:12] restore the hand and they don't want a
[59:14] God that can restore a hand they want a
[59:16] God that vindicates their traditional
[59:17] belief
[59:21] I tell you what the same thing can be
[59:23] true today
[59:25] amen they don't want a God that can
[59:27] deliver they don't want a God that can
[59:29] heal they don't want a God who can
[59:30] answer the questions they want a God who
[59:33] will confirm
[59:34] what they already hold to be true
[59:39] and we're gone on this day so thoroughly
[59:42] confirmed his word through a prophetic
[59:44] Ministry amen now they begin to call it
[59:47] Blasphemous names they begin to call it
[59:50] works of the devil and and a man who
[59:52] went off in the end they begin to call
[59:53] it all kinds of names and then although
[59:55] he did the same sign that Jesus did
[59:58] there when the man stretched forth his
[1:00:00] withered hand they sought how they might
[1:00:02] destroy him
[1:00:04] how do we destroy this ministry just
[1:00:06] speak evil against it
[1:00:07] tell the people don't go out there don't
[1:00:09] listen don't believe
[1:00:11] so we've seen a repeat in the same day
[1:00:13] all the way down to this day right here
[1:00:16] brother Ben says in the in the Ephesians
[1:00:19] Church age from the church age book so
[1:00:22] no matter how just an upright of
[1:00:23] Christian is before the public and how
[1:00:26] gracious he is to his fellow man doing
[1:00:28] not but good let him confess Christ as
[1:00:30] his Savior and acknowledge the operation
[1:00:31] of the gifts of the holy spirit in
[1:00:33] tongues prophecy healing Miracles and he
[1:00:35] will be condemned the spirit of this
[1:00:38] world hates the spirit of God
[1:00:41] and because it can't overcome the spirit
[1:00:43] of the Lord it tries to destroy the
[1:00:46] vessel in which the spirit of Truth
[1:00:47] dwells
[1:00:50] hmm
[1:00:51] persecution and trials are a natural
[1:00:54] normal part of Christian Life
[1:00:57] I'm going to read that again
[1:00:59] I should encourage us all persecution
[1:01:02] and trials are a natural normal part of
[1:01:06] the Christian Life
[1:01:09] there is only one thing you can do about
[1:01:10] them commit them all to God judge not
[1:01:12] and leave their outworking and final
[1:01:14] judgment to him
[1:01:16] so the one phrase that I want to labor
[1:01:19] on is it because
[1:01:20] because it can't overcome the spirit of
[1:01:23] the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel
[1:01:26] in which the spirit of Truth dwells
[1:01:29] we saw this in the life of Jesus we saw
[1:01:31] in the disciples when we saw it even
[1:01:34] even brother Branham brother Branham uh
[1:01:36] believed he was convinced that one day
[1:01:38] he would be shot for what he taught he
[1:01:41] so knew that that spirit and how that
[1:01:42] Spirit worked and that Spirit hated him
[1:01:44] he knew it was after him
[1:01:46] and the same thing's true today but
[1:01:48] there's only a resemblance of
[1:01:50] Christianity that's holding it by but
[1:01:52] the same the same spirit's still here
[1:01:54] and wants to destroy you
[1:01:58] so
[1:02:00] uh further down in the in the laodicean
[1:02:03] church age out of the church age book he
[1:02:05] says these things saith thee amen I like
[1:02:09] that it means that whatever he said is
[1:02:11] final it means that whatever he said to
[1:02:13] the first age and to the second to all
[1:02:15] ages about his own true church and about
[1:02:17] the false Vine is exactly right and it
[1:02:20] won't change it means that what he
[1:02:21] started out with in Genesis he will
[1:02:23] finish in Revelation he has to for he is
[1:02:26] the amen so let it be now we can see
[1:02:28] again why the devil hates the Book of
[1:02:30] Genesis in Revelation he hates the truth
[1:02:34] he knows the truth will prevail he knows
[1:02:37] what his end will be and how he fights
[1:02:40] that but we are on the winning side we I
[1:02:42] mean the Believers of his word only are
[1:02:44] on the amen side
[1:02:47] so now what does the devil hate what
[1:02:49] does the devil fight truth
[1:02:51] what was he fighting in Jesus day truth
[1:02:53] what was he finding and Abel's day truth
[1:02:56] what were they fighting in brother
[1:02:57] Brandon say truth what are they fighting
[1:02:59] today what is that Spirit what is the
[1:03:01] devil fighting truth
[1:03:03] and I want to look at that statement
[1:03:05] again out of the Ephesians Church age
[1:03:07] when he says because he knows he can't
[1:03:10] defeat the spirit of God knows he can't
[1:03:13] knows that he that the word will prevail
[1:03:15] amen he because he can't stop it he
[1:03:18] tries to destroy the vessel in which the
[1:03:21] spirit of Truth dwells
[1:03:23] and we look at that in the past and we
[1:03:25] see you know persecutions and executions
[1:03:27] and all that but but I say it comes
[1:03:31] let's bring it down closer to home
[1:03:34] today
[1:03:36] because you have the revelation of the
[1:03:38] word and you know the truth that can
[1:03:40] expose the devil's hiding place
[1:03:43] the devil will try to destroy your
[1:03:46] vessel
[1:03:48] and we think well you know I'm not in
[1:03:50] danger of being shot I mean it's not the
[1:03:52] the Jesuit Vigilantes are after me but
[1:03:56] no he'll bring anything he can to
[1:03:58] destroy your physical vessel to try to
[1:04:00] stop the truth from coming forth he'll
[1:04:03] bring sickness and mental oppression and
[1:04:06] all kinds of discouragement and
[1:04:07] disappointment and all kinds of things
[1:04:09] why are you so much under attack in this
[1:04:12] day amen it's not as though we we you
[1:04:15] know we get the wrong idea sometimes
[1:04:17] that when we get the truth we'll be an
[1:04:18] invisible Army an invincible Army is an
[1:04:21] Untouchable Army
[1:04:22] in an invincible Army is not an
[1:04:24] Untouchable Army it's an army that can't
[1:04:26] be defeated
[1:04:28] and so now the devil is launching
[1:04:31] attacks and he's launching attacks in
[1:04:33] our life he's launching attacks in our
[1:04:35] mind he's launching attacks in our body
[1:04:37] it means bringing Affliction and
[1:04:39] sickness and fear and trouble and all
[1:04:41] kinds of stuff coming our way and you
[1:04:43] want to know why every day of your life
[1:04:45] is trouble and you go from one trouble
[1:04:46] to the next trouble with hardly reprieve
[1:04:49] in between it's because he hates the
[1:04:51] truth that is inside of you and he's
[1:04:52] trying whatever he can to stop the truth
[1:04:55] from displaying out
[1:04:56] because he can't fight that truth he
[1:04:59] can't fight that Spirit of Revelation he
[1:05:01] can't stop it from winning so he's
[1:05:03] trying to destroy the vessel so that the
[1:05:05] vessel won't proclaim the truth
[1:05:09] he's tried imprisonment he's tried
[1:05:11] sickness he's tried everything
[1:05:16] but he's not going to win
[1:05:18] because God is predestinated a bride in
[1:05:20] this day that'll stand on the word and
[1:05:22] the word only and she will Proclaim that
[1:05:24] word she will live that word she'll
[1:05:25] Proclaim it with her words she'll
[1:05:27] Proclaim it with her life she'll
[1:05:28] Proclaim it with her actions amen it'll
[1:05:30] be the word on display and he will not
[1:05:32] win
[1:05:33] but I think it behooves us to understand
[1:05:35] what's going on because spiritual war
[1:05:38] starts with revelation
[1:05:41] it begins with revelation
[1:05:45] amen that's why the higher you go in
[1:05:48] Revelation the more
[1:05:51] the more your life falls into trouble
[1:05:56] is the opposite of what a human being
[1:05:58] would think the higher I go in
[1:06:00] Revelation the more ordered my life
[1:06:02] should be and everything should come
[1:06:03] along amen no because you've got an
[1:06:06] enemy a real enemy and when the trumpet
[1:06:08] blasts amen there's spiritual warfare
[1:06:10] declared Amen in that spiritual warfare
[1:06:13] is all about the revelation of the hour
[1:06:15] and as you catch the Revelation in the
[1:06:17] hour and it gets clearer and clearer and
[1:06:19] you have the audacity to Proclaim it you
[1:06:21] better watch out because all the forces
[1:06:23] of hell are coming against that truth
[1:06:25] amen it's not you as a person the devil
[1:06:28] doesn't hate your air hair color your
[1:06:29] shape your size your birth he doesn't
[1:06:31] care about where you come from where you
[1:06:33] live that's not what the devil's after
[1:06:35] the devil's after the truth that is held
[1:06:37] in your heart
[1:06:39] yeah
[1:06:40] and he will stop at nothing I promise
[1:06:43] you he'll stop at nothing to stop that
[1:06:45] truth
[1:06:48] where has the battle always been every
[1:06:50] age every Prophet every child of God
[1:06:53] every move of the Holy Spirit everyone
[1:06:55] the enemy has been trying to stop those
[1:06:58] vessels
[1:07:00] they would cut Isaiah's head off they
[1:07:02] would throw Jeremiah into a dungeon
[1:07:05] they would hang Jesus on the cross they
[1:07:07] would kill every one of the disciples
[1:07:09] except for John
[1:07:11] what was the devil trying to do it
[1:07:13] wasn't that they had anything against
[1:07:15] Peter when Peter was a fisherman he had
[1:07:17] no problems
[1:07:19] I mean he may have had a problem they
[1:07:21] didn't get his daily catch it might have
[1:07:23] once in a while had a financial problem
[1:07:24] and had a bad day and broken that and
[1:07:26] got a boat leak
[1:07:28] you're saying he lived a normal human
[1:07:30] life
[1:07:32] but when Peter caught the revelation of
[1:07:34] the hour and started proclaiming the
[1:07:36] revelation of the hour there went his
[1:07:38] normal life with his normal troubles
[1:07:41] his troubles went up times 10 times 20
[1:07:44] times 50 because now the Warfare was all
[1:07:47] around him he was in the middle of a
[1:07:49] battle a spiritual war between two
[1:07:51] opposing forces
[1:07:55] see I
[1:07:58] I don't want us to get discouraged
[1:08:00] because of what's Happening
[1:08:04] it should be happening
[1:08:06] it ought to be happening
[1:08:09] it ought to be getting worse
[1:08:12] if the Revelation is getting clearer
[1:08:15] the attempted destruction of Your Vessel
[1:08:19] should get stronger
[1:08:22] do you agree with that would that be
[1:08:24] normal from what we've seen in the Bible
[1:08:26] amen the Apostle Paul amen let's just
[1:08:29] turn to Galatians I want to read
[1:08:30] something out of the life of the Apostle
[1:08:32] Paul
[1:08:35] Galatians chapter one
[1:08:46] look at Galatians 1.
[1:08:50] I'm gonna start with verse 10.
[1:08:54] for doing not persuade men or God
[1:08:58] or do I seek to please men for I yet
[1:09:01] please men I should not be the servant
[1:09:03] of Christ
[1:09:05] but I certify you Brethren that the
[1:09:07] gospel which was preached of me is not
[1:09:08] after man
[1:09:09] for I neither received it of man neither
[1:09:11] was I taught it but by the revelation of
[1:09:13] Jesus Christ
[1:09:15] for you have heard of my conversion in
[1:09:17] times past in the Jews religion
[1:09:20] stop right there
[1:09:23] I'm going to read that again
[1:09:25] if you've heard of my conversion in
[1:09:27] times past in the Jews religion
[1:09:30] he was converted from the Jews religion
[1:09:35] he wasn't in the truth
[1:09:37] he thought he was in the truth
[1:09:40] but what he found out is he was in the
[1:09:41] Jews religion
[1:09:44] many of us who have come out of
[1:09:46] denominationalism we thought we were in
[1:09:48] the truth but for me personally I
[1:09:50] thought I was in the truth but I found
[1:09:52] out I was in the Pentecostals religion
[1:09:55] because they had taken the truth and the
[1:09:57] devil had gotten in after the Revival
[1:09:59] went forth it declared blew a trumpet
[1:10:01] spiritual warfare broke out the church
[1:10:03] went into spiritual death
[1:10:06] the devil got in and corrupted the truth
[1:10:08] and perverted the truth and kept them
[1:10:10] from moving forward when the prophet of
[1:10:11] God came and so I thought that I was
[1:10:14] raised in truth like Paul thought he was
[1:10:16] raised in truth
[1:10:17] I thought I knew the truth like Paul
[1:10:18] thought he not knew the truth I defended
[1:10:20] it and fought for and stood up for it
[1:10:22] because I thought it was true just like
[1:10:23] Paul thought it was truth but Paul when
[1:10:25] he received the revelation of Jesus
[1:10:27] Christ he knew he had to be converted
[1:10:29] from the Jews religion because he wasn't
[1:10:31] in the truth he was in the Jews religion
[1:10:34] and I tell you there's there's Jews
[1:10:37] religion everywhere there's man-made
[1:10:38] religion all over the place that's not
[1:10:40] the truth but the truth is found in the
[1:10:42] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:45] and when Paul came to the revelation of
[1:10:47] Jesus Christ
[1:10:48] he was
[1:10:51] convert him if you've heard of my
[1:10:53] conversation and time passed in the
[1:10:54] Jew's religion how that beyond measure I
[1:10:57] persecuted the Church of God and wasted
[1:10:59] it and profited listen to this
[1:11:03] and profited in the Jews religion
[1:11:08] and profited in the Jewish religion
[1:11:11] being in the Jews religion was good for
[1:11:14] Paul
[1:11:17] oh praise God good Lord God give us eyes
[1:11:20] to see
[1:11:22] being in the Jews religion
[1:11:24] was profitable for Paul
[1:11:27] verse 14 again and propheted in the
[1:11:29] Jewish religion above many my equals in
[1:11:31] my own Nation being more exceedingly
[1:11:34] zealous of the truth
[1:11:37] of the traditions of the fathers
[1:11:40] but when it pleased God who separated me
[1:11:43] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:11:45] his grace to reveal his son and me that
[1:11:47] I might preach him among the Heathen
[1:11:49] immediately I confer not with flesh and
[1:11:51] blood neither when I up to Jerusalem to
[1:11:53] them which were Apostles before me but I
[1:11:56] went to Arabia and returned again unto
[1:11:58] Damascus
[1:12:00] Paul he knew
[1:12:04] that he had to get away
[1:12:06] from the Jews religion
[1:12:09] when he receives the revelation of Jesus
[1:12:11] Christ he ran into the Wilderness he
[1:12:12] receives it not a man but he received it
[1:12:14] from Christ himself God gave him a
[1:12:17] revelation of the truth and he was able
[1:12:19] to see he was able then to clearly see
[1:12:21] that he was zealous for the wrong thing
[1:12:23] that he was profiting in the Jews
[1:12:25] religion and I tell you the Apostle
[1:12:27] Paul's life was fine when he was in the
[1:12:30] Jews religion
[1:12:32] the Apostle Paul was profiting in that
[1:12:34] religion he was successful in that
[1:12:36] religion he was receiving accolades from
[1:12:39] his peers he was it was things were
[1:12:41] going fine and it doesn't mean that he
[1:12:43] didn't have a normal sickness from time
[1:12:44] to time and the normal things that
[1:12:46] happened in the normal life but I tell
[1:12:48] you when he left the Jews religion and
[1:12:50] he was converted away from one of the
[1:12:52] traditions of the fathers and he came to
[1:12:54] the present day truth I'll tell you
[1:12:56] right now all hell broke loose on Paul
[1:13:00] every gun every gun and devil in hell
[1:13:03] was now aiming for Paul now Paul was
[1:13:06] chased from City to City he had
[1:13:08] distresses without distresses within
[1:13:10] turmoil on the sea and beatings and
[1:13:12] floggings and stonings and chasing from
[1:13:15] City to City
[1:13:16] his life totally switched amen when he
[1:13:20] came from error to truth he went from a
[1:13:22] good life to a very uncomfortable life
[1:13:28] it happened to Peter James John
[1:13:32] it happened to Simon having to to all of
[1:13:36] them amen they had their normal life
[1:13:38] they were in the Jews religion they
[1:13:40] thought they had the truth everything
[1:13:42] was seemingly fine normal of course
[1:13:44] normal problems normally everything but
[1:13:46] all of a sudden amen when they began to
[1:13:49] proclaim the truth there was a gospel
[1:13:50] trumpet that sounded in their day and
[1:13:52] when they rallied to that gospel trumpet
[1:13:54] they realized all hell broke loose
[1:13:59] all of a sudden they they were hated
[1:14:02] Peter wasn't hated when he was a
[1:14:05] fisherman
[1:14:06] he was hated when he proclaimed the
[1:14:08] truth
[1:14:09] Paul wasn't hated in false religion he
[1:14:11] was hated when he came to the truth
[1:14:16] and now and I I wanna uh Focus here for
[1:14:21] just a minute don't look for persecution
[1:14:24] from church groups
[1:14:26] and think that the only way that I'll
[1:14:29] feel this kind of pressure is from
[1:14:31] church groups that's not what I'm
[1:14:32] talking about I'm talking about every
[1:14:34] devil in hell wants to shut you down
[1:14:38] and it may not be involve another church
[1:14:40] group it may not be a religious
[1:14:42] persecution
[1:14:44] it may not be religious persecution it
[1:14:47] may be an Affliction in your flesh it
[1:14:49] may be a loss of income from a loss of a
[1:14:51] job it may be trouble upon trouble upon
[1:14:54] trouble it could be your house fire car
[1:14:57] breakdown I mean I know any number of
[1:14:59] things the attempt of the devil is to
[1:15:02] get that truth suppressed
[1:15:06] suppress the truth because he doesn't
[1:15:09] want to hear the truth he doesn't want
[1:15:11] the truth to get out when Jesus started
[1:15:13] speaking the truth amen he was fine
[1:15:16] Jesus lived 30 years upon the Earth and
[1:15:18] we have no record of him having trouble
[1:15:20] with any other human being
[1:15:22] no record of any religious re any priest
[1:15:26] anybody in his town any levite any
[1:15:29] priest that wanted to do anything to
[1:15:31] Jesus Christ we have no record of
[1:15:32] anybody being against him attacking him
[1:15:35] saying negative things about him until
[1:15:37] he stepped forth and began to Proclaim
[1:15:39] his message and as soon as he began to
[1:15:41] Proclaim his message even his own family
[1:15:43] began to question him and doubt him and
[1:15:45] accuse him
[1:15:49] Jesus comes into his hometown amen it
[1:15:52] begins to speak in the synagogue with
[1:15:54] authority and they're amazed at how he
[1:15:56] speaks well wisdom where did he get this
[1:15:58] wisdom and he does all of these Miracles
[1:15:59] and then he healed the sick and then
[1:16:01] they it says isn't this the carpenter
[1:16:07] isn't this the carpenter
[1:16:09] isn't his brothers with us and his
[1:16:11] mother and and it says and they were
[1:16:13] offended at him
[1:16:16] it we have no record that they were
[1:16:18] offended before
[1:16:21] when he was a boy in the street when he
[1:16:22] was growing up
[1:16:24] and they said isn't this the carpenter
[1:16:27] so apparently he had some occupation
[1:16:29] among them rubbed shoulders with the
[1:16:32] community
[1:16:33] maybe I don't know you could only
[1:16:36] imagine what it was like for 30 years
[1:16:39] then all of a sudden everything changed
[1:16:42] because a prophet declared him
[1:16:44] the Holy Ghost anointed him he went into
[1:16:47] his ministry when he went into his
[1:16:49] ministry every devil in hell come after
[1:16:54] him
[1:16:58] why do I have so many troubles if I'm a
[1:17:00] Child of God if I believe the truth why
[1:17:03] isn't it working for me
[1:17:06] I'd say it's working just right
[1:17:09] everything's right on time everything's
[1:17:11] going according to the Bible
[1:17:13] nothing's out of kilter amen you Jesus
[1:17:16] says be of good cheer
[1:17:18] this is be of good cheer
[1:17:21] in this life you shall have tribulation
[1:17:24] oh okay and be of good cheer
[1:17:28] be of good cheer in this life you've got
[1:17:30] tribulation but I have overcome
[1:17:33] I have overcome the world I've ever and
[1:17:36] when he overcame I overcame
[1:17:39] when he says be of good cheer in this
[1:17:41] life you've got tribulation that's a
[1:17:43] given amen a man that is born a woman is
[1:17:45] a few days in full of troubles
[1:17:47] he looks at his disciples hey they're
[1:17:49] the Disciples of the Lord the chosen of
[1:17:50] the Lord the anointed to carry forth his
[1:17:52] word he's promised that he will come in
[1:17:54] them and he will continue on his
[1:17:55] ministry inside of them amen they've got
[1:17:57] all kinds of promises they've got all
[1:17:59] kinds of power coming to them and he
[1:18:00] promised them you shall have tribulation
[1:18:03] they'll be of good cheer
[1:18:05] oh friends I'll tell you right now you
[1:18:07] will have tribulation
[1:18:10] but be of good cheer
[1:18:12] he's overcome the world
[1:18:15] the victory is sure
[1:18:19] so what's the goal what's the end goal
[1:18:22] what does the devil want to do
[1:18:24] he wants to suppress the truth
[1:18:27] where is the truth it's in the bride
[1:18:30] where's the truth it's in the bride
[1:18:33] if you can say the truth is in me
[1:18:37] then I'll tell you right now there's two
[1:18:39] hundred thousand thousand demons Special
[1:18:42] Forces demons
[1:18:44] that have been released in the end time
[1:18:46] and if you want to know what those
[1:18:48] demons are like go and read about the
[1:18:50] Holocaust because those demons went into
[1:18:52] the armies of Hitler Mussolini and
[1:18:54] Stalin and they brought a bitter
[1:18:55] persecution against the Jews
[1:18:58] those are those demons and brother
[1:19:00] remember those demons come out amen
[1:19:04] those demons come out
[1:19:06] under the a sixth trumpet and under the
[1:19:10] Sixth trumpet they go out and they bring
[1:19:11] a persecution and God allows it because
[1:19:13] he's driving the Jews back to their
[1:19:15] Homeland but you see what nature that
[1:19:18] these Spirits have
[1:19:21] right and then he tells us later that
[1:19:24] they couldn't get over into the
[1:19:25] ecclesiastical Realm
[1:19:27] because they couldn't cross Euphrates
[1:19:29] because the Catholic church and all the
[1:19:32] other Protestants they had to keep a
[1:19:33] semblance of Christianity
[1:19:36] so he couldn't cross over but then and
[1:19:39] then brother Branham comes along and he
[1:19:40] says now amen they've crossed over
[1:19:43] Euphrates which goes right to the sixth
[1:19:46] vile
[1:19:47] he's tying these these things together
[1:19:49] in the end time and he's showing now
[1:19:51] they've moved over into ecclesiastical
[1:19:53] realm and what are they doing now these
[1:19:55] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:19:57] amen are not bringing a bitter
[1:19:59] persecution against the Jews anymore now
[1:20:01] they're coming he said what are they
[1:20:03] coming for for the denomination no
[1:20:04] they're coming for the bride
[1:20:08] so those same hateful spirits that hated
[1:20:10] Jews Without a Cause
[1:20:13] that changed laws that brought
[1:20:15] persecution amen then trapped and killed
[1:20:18] and all of those horrible things they
[1:20:19] did those same Spirits now moved over
[1:20:22] into the ecclesiastical realm now
[1:20:24] they're Church Spirits they're working
[1:20:26] in churches what are they trying to do
[1:20:28] they're trying to go after the bride why
[1:20:31] because she's the only one on this
[1:20:34] planet that has the revelation of the
[1:20:36] truth that will expose the devil's lie
[1:20:39] because the devil has got a lie running
[1:20:42] and the LIE running is all you have to
[1:20:44] do is receive a historical Jesus and be
[1:20:46] part of some church group somewhere and
[1:20:48] you're going to be fine
[1:20:50] and there's a bride on the earth that
[1:20:52] can expose that lie amen and they've got
[1:20:54] to shut that down because the devil
[1:20:56] wants total control
[1:21:00] and the truth is the light that breaks
[1:21:02] the chains and sets the people free and
[1:21:04] he doesn't want the people to go free
[1:21:11] he hates the truth
[1:21:13] he knows the truth will prevail
[1:21:16] he can't he can't take the truth out of
[1:21:19] your heart
[1:21:21] he can't change your revelation
[1:21:24] but what he can do is bring so much
[1:21:26] affliction
[1:21:29] so much trouble
[1:21:30] trying to bring doubts into your mind
[1:21:33] about who you are
[1:21:36] so much trouble so much Affliction
[1:21:38] because if he can get you to doubt Who
[1:21:41] You Are
[1:21:43] if you can if you if you could just if
[1:21:45] he can get you to to forget your
[1:21:47] position and forget your calling and
[1:21:49] election if he can get you so troubled
[1:21:51] and so tormented and so bothered amen
[1:21:54] that you cannot see clearly who you are
[1:21:56] anymore and you begin to have the Eagle
[1:21:58] Eye filmed over and you begin to
[1:22:00] withdraw amen and you begin to pull back
[1:22:02] amen that's the only way that he can
[1:22:05] control and maintain power in this end
[1:22:07] time is if he can stop the bride from
[1:22:09] progressing in the revelation
[1:22:13] yes sir
[1:22:16] I say thank God for a prophet
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:21] no matter what happens to my flesh no
[1:22:24] matter what happens all around me God
[1:22:26] give me Grace to Proclaim your truth to
[1:22:28] live it to have it on display no matter
[1:22:31] what it cost me Lord if I lose
[1:22:33] everything and all my reputation and all
[1:22:35] my friends and my finances if I lose
[1:22:37] everything Lord let me hold fast to that
[1:22:40] truth because the truth is what will
[1:22:41] have Victory it's the truth that will
[1:22:43] win the day it's the revelation of the
[1:22:45] hour that will deliver me from this
[1:22:47] hybrid condition and take me to the
[1:22:49] place I've always wanted to go
[1:22:51] the only thing I have for victory is the
[1:22:53] revelation of the hour the only thing I
[1:22:55] have is what he's given me by his spirit
[1:22:57] and by his grace amen he put a seed in
[1:22:59] me quickened it by his Spirit he brought
[1:23:01] the Revelation out and that's the only
[1:23:03] thing I have to defeat the Devils the
[1:23:05] revelation of the word
[1:23:07] when Jesus was faced with the devil all
[1:23:09] he had as it is written
[1:23:11] it is written
[1:23:13] it is written
[1:23:14] listen Jesus was hungry
[1:23:19] he had a physical condition
[1:23:22] he hadn't eaten for 40 days
[1:23:26] and the devil tried to get him to use
[1:23:28] the word to change his physical
[1:23:29] condition
[1:23:32] make this bread
[1:23:35] and Jesus didn't take the bait
[1:23:38] he wasn't there
[1:23:40] to play the devil's game with the word
[1:23:43] he wasn't there to prove who he was
[1:23:46] if you're this then if you say if you're
[1:23:49] the Son of God then throw yourself down
[1:23:51] his angels shall bear the young what's
[1:23:53] the devil using the devil is using the
[1:23:55] word and he's using the word tried to
[1:23:57] try to bring doubt on who Jesus Christ
[1:24:00] is
[1:24:02] and he's trying to entice the is it the
[1:24:05] devil is trying to entice Jesus into to
[1:24:09] proving to taking the word to try to
[1:24:11] vindicate himself
[1:24:14] and all Jesus did was take the word and
[1:24:16] rebuke the devil
[1:24:18] but then change his condition
[1:24:21] he tried he tried to get him to change
[1:24:23] his condition to become a ruler a
[1:24:25] powerful ruler over the Earth he didn't
[1:24:27] he did not take debate he didn't change
[1:24:29] his condition he stayed in his condition
[1:24:31] and stayed with the word
[1:24:34] whatever God allows
[1:24:36] God allows
[1:24:38] whatever God permits I'll take the word
[1:24:41] and I'll stand on the word if I'm sick
[1:24:43] I'm Healed in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:24:45] was healed before the foundation world
[1:24:46] it was paid for at Calvary
[1:24:49] I believe it with all of my heart
[1:24:51] but but I'm going to commit it to God
[1:24:54] I'm going to believe the word and I'm
[1:24:55] going to keep pressing forward in the
[1:24:57] revelation of the hour I'm not going to
[1:24:59] let that Affliction and that thing stop
[1:25:01] my forward progress
[1:25:03] I'm not going to let the troubles that
[1:25:05] come up in our lives in our families and
[1:25:08] work and all around us I'm not going to
[1:25:10] let that stop me amen from laboring in
[1:25:12] the word from loving the Revelation from
[1:25:14] moving forward from proclaiming it from
[1:25:16] living it amen does it get us down yes
[1:25:18] does it get us depressed yes is it a
[1:25:20] mental depression and affliction
[1:25:22] absolutely but you got to recognize the
[1:25:24] devil at his tactics he's trying to get
[1:25:27] you to pull back and hold up and run
[1:25:30] into a cave and stay away
[1:25:33] because every interaction you have is a
[1:25:36] threat to his kingdom
[1:25:39] every book that you carry your Satchel
[1:25:41] amen every tape that you've got every
[1:25:43] exchange you have with another human
[1:25:45] being amen is a threat to his kingdom
[1:25:48] the light that shines from you and your
[1:25:51] countenance and your appearance the way
[1:25:53] you dress the way you act the way your
[1:25:54] family is ordered when you move through
[1:25:56] places everything about you is a threat
[1:25:59] to his kingdom
[1:26:01] at any moment he could lose another one
[1:26:06] why the light will shine
[1:26:08] penetrate the darkness
[1:26:10] bring a seed to life
[1:26:14] if he can keep the last seed from coming
[1:26:16] forth
[1:26:18] then Satan's Eden is secure
[1:26:23] if he can if he can get one subject to
[1:26:26] let down on the word
[1:26:28] his kingdom is secure
[1:26:32] if you can just get one subject to let
[1:26:34] down on the word his kingdom is secure
[1:26:37] if he can get keep the last seed from
[1:26:39] coming forth his kingdom is secure
[1:26:42] why do you think he fights you so bad
[1:26:46] why do you think
[1:26:48] why do you think men
[1:26:51] two thousand years ago men
[1:26:53] that lived their whole life to be
[1:26:55] perfect before the people
[1:26:57] Pharisees and Priests
[1:27:00] men who read the Bible and studied it
[1:27:03] from the time they were children
[1:27:06] men who committed their lives to the
[1:27:09] word that they were reading to to live
[1:27:11] righteously to live right and keep the
[1:27:13] laws and not break the laws and not
[1:27:15] break the Commandments they lived
[1:27:16] everything what would move those men to
[1:27:20] lie
[1:27:22] to bribe
[1:27:24] to murder
[1:27:25] to cover it up
[1:27:28] what would move those men to do those
[1:27:30] things because they hated the truth
[1:27:33] and they had to stop that truth
[1:27:36] men who you wouldn't think would do it
[1:27:39] men who you wouldn't think would be
[1:27:41] capable of it but there was another
[1:27:42] spirit in them that hated the spirit of
[1:27:44] truth that was in those disciples hated
[1:27:47] the spirit of truth that was in Jesus
[1:27:48] Christ and those same Spirits are here
[1:27:50] that hates the spirit of truth that's in
[1:27:52] you
[1:27:58] that's why you find the disciples praise
[1:28:02] God you find them the disciples life
[1:28:04] they were never striking back at what
[1:28:07] was striking them
[1:28:10] you understand they they didn't war with
[1:28:13] flesh and blood they didn't war with
[1:28:14] mankind amen they had a job to do and
[1:28:17] the job to do a Paul's job was to dust
[1:28:20] off his britches and go to the next town
[1:28:22] and see if there was any believers there
[1:28:26] it wasn't he didn't go and file a formal
[1:28:28] complaint and rally a bunch of people
[1:28:30] and have a big protest against the
[1:28:32] government here his job he knew what his
[1:28:34] job was and his job was to Shine the
[1:28:36] Light his job was to proclaim the gospel
[1:28:39] amen and whatever happened happened God
[1:28:41] was in control of it all he trusted the
[1:28:43] Lord amen and he moved and he kept
[1:28:45] moving forward and his purpose on this
[1:28:47] planet
[1:28:48] and I say for you and I and friends
[1:28:50] we're Afflicted we have troubles we have
[1:28:52] difficulties we have all kinds of forces
[1:28:54] of the devil that is trying to gonna
[1:28:56] they're gonna try to work in your mind
[1:28:58] to bring a shadow over your mind
[1:29:01] to bring mental depression and
[1:29:03] affliction and doubts and questions and
[1:29:05] complicated scenarios
[1:29:10] what are you going to do
[1:29:11] I'm going to keep proclaiming the gospel
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:15] I'm going to keep proclaiming the gospel
[1:29:17] because I know what this is amen this is
[1:29:19] not I've lost my sonship this is not the
[1:29:22] that that God has rejected me and I'm
[1:29:24] not a child of God this is the enemy
[1:29:25] trying to stop me from doing what I was
[1:29:27] put on this planet to do and I'm on this
[1:29:30] planet to shine the lie in my life and
[1:29:32] my conduct my actions my word where I go
[1:29:34] to church how I speak to my co-workers
[1:29:36] the things that I share and the things
[1:29:38] that I talk about
[1:29:39] and I'm not going to stop that how many
[1:29:41] of you have had a a day where you're
[1:29:43] just so bogged down by trouble mental
[1:29:45] depression is so weak in your mind or in
[1:29:48] your body and there's so many things
[1:29:50] going on at once amen you walk you walk
[1:29:52] into a golden opportunity to witness an
[1:29:54] open door and you and yourself don't
[1:29:57] have the strength to walk through that
[1:29:58] door
[1:29:59] I've been there
[1:30:00] I confess I've been there I've backed
[1:30:03] away
[1:30:06] because I I know it's going to be a long
[1:30:08] conversation I know how this goes
[1:30:10] I just don't have the energy today
[1:30:15] and I've went home and wept
[1:30:17] and told God I was sorry
[1:30:20] because I let the Affliction of the
[1:30:22] devil stop me from doing what I'm on
[1:30:24] this planet to do
[1:30:28] I let mental troubles and I let troubles
[1:30:30] all around me and the piling up of
[1:30:32] difficult situation I let it steal my
[1:30:35] joy and Rob my testimony and take my
[1:30:37] confession
[1:30:41] I thank God there's a holy ghost there
[1:30:43] that'll bring conviction and say nobody
[1:30:45] you can't go that way
[1:30:46] and I'll repent and say God forgive me
[1:30:48] and give me another chance
[1:30:50] I'm sorry
[1:30:52] but do you see the tactic of the devil
[1:30:55] it's not you
[1:30:57] that's not you that's the devil
[1:31:01] what's he trying to do he's trying
[1:31:03] because he can't stop the spirit of God
[1:31:07] and he's trying to destroy the vessel
[1:31:11] that the spirit of Truth is working
[1:31:13] through
[1:31:18] say though the vessel is harmed
[1:31:22] the spirit of truth will come forth
[1:31:25] so the vessel may be battered The Vessel
[1:31:28] may be bruised but maybe may I take it
[1:31:31] like Paul took it Lauren
[1:31:33] my taketh the way the disciples took it
[1:31:36] and my Christ took it and brother banham
[1:31:37] took it may I just take it and keep
[1:31:40] proclaiming the truth keep climbing
[1:31:42] higher keep walking with you Lord and
[1:31:44] keep testifying
[1:31:49] brother bear says in Christ is the
[1:31:51] mystery of God revealed
[1:31:52] so that's it Christ the word he was the
[1:31:55] word he is the word and the church
[1:31:57] becomes the word by making her a part of
[1:32:00] him
[1:32:01] and that's the word again personally
[1:32:03] identified by him his property alone his
[1:32:06] property alone she is Redeemed by him
[1:32:09] through him for him and for him alone
[1:32:12] that's right then once the devil is
[1:32:15] howling about that it's being revealed
[1:32:19] what's the devil howling about what's
[1:32:20] all the howling about is that this truth
[1:32:23] is being revealed
[1:32:24] what's he howling about in your home and
[1:32:26] in your life and in your mind he's
[1:32:28] howling about this truth being revealed
[1:32:34] when the final trumpet blew it declared
[1:32:37] spiritual war
[1:32:40] but this may be just me
[1:32:45] but what kind of spiritual war what kind
[1:32:48] of trumpet blast was that
[1:32:51] it was different than the previous six
[1:32:54] the previous six was this truth here
[1:32:59] this this truth of Christ here and the
[1:33:03] battle over that truth but when this
[1:33:05] gospel trumpet blew this last trumpet
[1:33:07] blue it was a gathering up of all the
[1:33:10] truths that were lost through all the
[1:33:11] ages in the full revelation of God in
[1:33:15] Jesus Christ now coming forth what kind
[1:33:18] of war broke out on that day
[1:33:22] what kind of War are we in friends what
[1:33:26] kind of battle is this
[1:33:28] oh if God one time would just be able to
[1:33:33] shift our eyesight and we could look
[1:33:34] into the supernatural realm and see
[1:33:36] what's going on brother Branham was
[1:33:38] given that opportunity in JCPenney one
[1:33:41] time
[1:33:42] is that true
[1:33:44] brother Brandon was in JCPenney and he
[1:33:46] was sitting there in JCPenney and in
[1:33:48] JCPenney he saw
[1:33:50] materialized before his eyes something
[1:33:52] that he had seen when he went to the
[1:33:54] regions of the lost when he went to hell
[1:33:56] when he was a boy
[1:33:57] when he went to hell he saw the women
[1:33:59] with painted up eyes and that mournful
[1:34:02] moaning and those water head haircuts
[1:34:04] and he's sitting in JCPenney waiting for
[1:34:06] his wife to shop amen and off comes the
[1:34:09] escalator two women speaking in Spanish
[1:34:10] the same scene he saw it it troubled him
[1:34:13] so bad his wife could tell when she came
[1:34:15] to him
[1:34:16] so what's wrong with you he said
[1:34:17] something just happened
[1:34:21] and brother Branham was able to catch
[1:34:24] what was going on and tie it back to
[1:34:26] where he was and he was able to
[1:34:28] determine that hell has now broke out
[1:34:30] upon the Earth
[1:34:32] hell is here
[1:34:36] hell we know that we know that the abyss
[1:34:40] has been opened
[1:34:41] the pit has been opened we know that the
[1:34:44] border of Euphrates has dried up we know
[1:34:47] that the the the the that the Angels
[1:34:49] Bound in the river have been released we
[1:34:51] know that we've been told that we know
[1:34:53] the forces of Hell have been released
[1:34:56] whatever's been bound up whatever's been
[1:34:57] held back whatever has been caged down
[1:34:59] until the end times has now been
[1:35:01] released and now in full force Amen in
[1:35:04] his upon the Earth gunning for where the
[1:35:06] truth is
[1:35:10] that could be awfully discouraging
[1:35:13] if it wasn't for the fact that I believe
[1:35:15] Heaven is here too
[1:35:19] if hell is broke forth upon the Earth
[1:35:22] then where's heaven
[1:35:24] where's the forces of heaven where's the
[1:35:26] armies of heaven where is the battle at
[1:35:29] the battles here
[1:35:31] the fight is here the Warfare is taking
[1:35:34] on here the trumpet blew here the fight
[1:35:36] broke out here and once this fight this
[1:35:38] fight is a spiritual war that's broke
[1:35:40] out between these two forces and it's
[1:35:41] taking place here if hell is here is
[1:35:44] heaven here too
[1:35:46] he said if you're an ambassador from
[1:35:48] Heaven amen he said if you're an
[1:35:50] ambassador from Heaven All Of Heaven is
[1:35:52] backing you up
[1:35:55] in heaven is consisted of the word
[1:35:59] he said in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:36:00] revealed again identified all the devil
[1:36:03] is howling about this
[1:36:06] the manifested truth of the promise of
[1:36:09] the word in her alone
[1:36:11] what's the devil hate he hates the
[1:36:13] revelation of the Bride coming of Christ
[1:36:17] that the word is in her alone
[1:36:22] who is the word who is the person of the
[1:36:24] word Jesus Christ and the word is in her
[1:36:26] alone
[1:36:28] they don't have the answer when Jesus
[1:36:30] come
[1:36:31] why didn't the Pharisees he said if I
[1:36:33] cast out Devils by the Finger of God who
[1:36:35] do you cast them out by see he stood
[1:36:36] alone in his church stands alone she is
[1:36:39] not hooked with nothing but he was
[1:36:41] identified by God being the body that
[1:36:43] God dwelt in and the church is
[1:36:45] identified by his body doing the same
[1:36:47] thing she is his body the manifested
[1:36:50] truth of his promised word for the last
[1:36:52] day
[1:36:53] and she and she alone stands by it
[1:36:57] that's why the devil is howling these
[1:36:59] great organizations to set up something
[1:37:01] to close her up
[1:37:03] they'll never do it she'll be taken up
[1:37:05] not closed up she is now risen by the
[1:37:09] power of the Vindicated word promised to
[1:37:11] her
[1:37:12] hey guess what friends she is now risen
[1:37:16] what's that mean that means I'm in
[1:37:18] Heavenly places in Christ he's now risen
[1:37:20] by by the Vindicated word promised to me
[1:37:23] I'm now part of that Heavenly Force
[1:37:25] fighting this battle
[1:37:27] here
[1:37:28] I've been lifted up
[1:37:33] brother Benham
[1:37:35] tells this little story
[1:37:37] of the little boy who goes to the city
[1:37:40] for the first time goes to his aunt's
[1:37:43] house and he goes up there and there's a
[1:37:44] mirror at the top of the steps and he
[1:37:45] runs up sees another little boy
[1:37:49] and that little boy raises his hand or
[1:37:51] he raises his hand the little boy in the
[1:37:53] mirror raises his hand
[1:37:54] and you can't figure out what it is he
[1:37:56] thinks it's another boy there
[1:37:58] and he begins to make gestures and move
[1:38:00] until he catches the revelation
[1:38:02] that that is a reflection of me
[1:38:06] that whatever is there is the same thing
[1:38:08] I am
[1:38:11] he turns to his mom he said Mama it's me
[1:38:17] we need to look into the mirror of God's
[1:38:19] word
[1:38:21] and we need to realize
[1:38:23] that's me
[1:38:25] what Paul went through that's me
[1:38:28] what Jesus went through with that's me
[1:38:29] what's what's in that word that's me
[1:38:33] and we need to get to the place where we
[1:38:34] say mama that's me this is me this is
[1:38:37] reflecting my life whatever whatever
[1:38:40] wrote this word whatever this was coming
[1:38:42] down through each age that revealed
[1:38:44] truth that that that
[1:38:46] manifestation of Christ in every age he
[1:38:49] was the rock that followed them through
[1:38:50] the Wilderness amen
[1:38:52] it was Christ in every age it was Christ
[1:38:55] he was there whatever that was that same
[1:38:58] thing that they wrote the Bible behind
[1:38:59] they wrote the Bible that same thing is
[1:39:01] in me it's a reflection of me
[1:39:04] what is it it's the manifested Christ
[1:39:06] today
[1:39:08] and I'm a part of it it's me I'm finding
[1:39:11] my identity in the mirror and I'm not
[1:39:13] saying well you know I might be I hope
[1:39:15] to be and someday maybe if I live a good
[1:39:17] life if I'm a good boy I hope to be
[1:39:18] accepted in someday but we got to read
[1:39:21] the word until we can identify the word
[1:39:23] until you see your reflection in the
[1:39:25] word and say whatever that is I am
[1:39:29] whatever it was amen that God nowhere in
[1:39:33] the boat is the same thing that's got me
[1:39:34] in the message today
[1:39:37] whatever it was amen that God and Caleb
[1:39:40] and Joshua to accept the prophet's word
[1:39:42] and believe Against All Odds that they
[1:39:44] could take the land that same thing that
[1:39:46] was in them is in me
[1:39:48] the same life The Same Spirit the same
[1:39:51] form come from the same Source whatever
[1:39:53] this is I am whatever it was in Paul is
[1:39:57] in me whatever it wasn't Peter is in me
[1:39:59] whatever it was in that day is in me now
[1:40:03] they lived their portion but now I'm
[1:40:05] living my portion and we look into the
[1:40:07] word so you can say it's me whatever
[1:40:09] that is it's me
[1:40:14] and when you can say that from the
[1:40:16] bottom of your heart with a full
[1:40:17] revelation
[1:40:19] all hell
[1:40:21] is against that revelation
[1:40:27] well maybe a couple demons maybe one or
[1:40:29] two no all hell
[1:40:31] is against this revelation
[1:40:39] he goes on in crisis mystery God
[1:40:41] revealed to say look Christ in you makes
[1:40:43] him
[1:40:45] the center of life of the Revelation
[1:40:48] Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:40:50] center of the Revelation Christ in the
[1:40:52] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[1:40:54] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[1:40:57] you the complete revelation of the whole
[1:40:59] thing
[1:41:02] Mama it's me
[1:41:06] Christ in you listen I'm going to say
[1:41:09] what the prophet said Christ in you
[1:41:11] makes you the complete revelation of the
[1:41:15] whole thing
[1:41:16] what God is trying to do
[1:41:21] what's God trying to do restore back a
[1:41:24] wife to his son to bring him back to an
[1:41:28] eating condition
[1:41:29] what's God been trying to do in the
[1:41:31] whole Bible he's been trying to restore
[1:41:33] back he had to restore Adam and after He
[1:41:35] restored Adam the last Adam he had to
[1:41:37] restore his wife Amen to do what to
[1:41:39] unite them back together and to put them
[1:41:42] back in an eating condition to bring him
[1:41:44] to the Millennium what's God been trying
[1:41:46] to do he's been trying to unite the
[1:41:48] bridegroom and the bride to bring him
[1:41:50] back to fulfill the purpose that they
[1:41:52] didn't finish in the beginning
[1:41:55] so where is that Revelation at now it's
[1:41:58] right here it's me it's me Mama it's me
[1:42:01] whatever is written there it's me what
[1:42:03] was written back in Genesis is me what's
[1:42:05] written over in Revelation it's me it's
[1:42:08] me it's me we've come to the time it was
[1:42:11] a Noah then amen but I was there
[1:42:14] is that what the prophet tells us I was
[1:42:16] there when Noah when they are I was
[1:42:18] there when they crossed through the Red
[1:42:19] Sea I was there why because the same
[1:42:22] life that's in me was the same life that
[1:42:24] was working there it's me Mama this
[1:42:27] Bible is me the reflection is me
[1:42:32] and all hell is against this revelation
[1:42:37] you can you can have other Revelations
[1:42:40] you can major on serpency and break down
[1:42:43] surfacing and you can find other
[1:42:45] Christians that will agree with you
[1:42:48] you can go on the Oneness of God versus
[1:42:51] Trinity and you can get others you can
[1:42:53] go anywhere else amen but the Revelation
[1:42:56] that all hell is against and everything
[1:42:58] he's fighting right now is this
[1:43:00] revelation of the Bride amen Christ
[1:43:03] coming in the formation of the Bride to
[1:43:05] do what to finish Amen to finish the
[1:43:08] restoration of what was lost in Eden to
[1:43:11] bring it back together in perfect Unity
[1:43:13] to overcome everything that the devil
[1:43:15] started back then
[1:43:17] why does he hate this Revelation it's
[1:43:19] the period it's the Finish Line it's the
[1:43:22] end of everything he started back there
[1:43:25] why is he fighting why does he fight you
[1:43:27] because your your manifestation is
[1:43:30] declaring the end
[1:43:32] of everything he's tried to do
[1:43:36] you coming forth you proclaiming the
[1:43:38] gospel you shining the light another
[1:43:40] seed coming forth and coming to life and
[1:43:42] manifesting the word is bringing the end
[1:43:44] to his kingdom in his reign
[1:43:50] that's why you get sick and you lose
[1:43:53] your job and you have family troubles
[1:43:55] and your car breaks down and everything
[1:43:56] in your life Falls to Pieces why because
[1:43:59] all hell is against this revelation
[1:44:02] and when all Hell Comes against you amen
[1:44:04] and everything comes in a cycle like a
[1:44:06] tidal wave that you never expected amen
[1:44:09] you stand fast and say I expected this
[1:44:12] nice dry devil
[1:44:21] it comes from the right from the left
[1:44:24] and straight up in a sneak attack from
[1:44:26] behind
[1:44:27] you can't defend against it you can't
[1:44:29] expect it you don't know that it's
[1:44:31] coming
[1:44:32] why because two hundred thousand
[1:44:35] thousand demons
[1:44:37] are aiming for the bride
[1:44:39] all right
[1:44:40] two hundred thousand thousand demons how
[1:44:42] many bride do you think on our Earth
[1:44:44] right now
[1:44:47] so how many and please don't answer that
[1:44:51] just keep it in your mind whatever that
[1:44:53] number is
[1:44:57] how many demons per believer
[1:45:03] two million I think is the number
[1:45:04] something like that
[1:45:06] how many per believer
[1:45:09] and you think life's going to be easy
[1:45:12] you think everything's gonna run smooth
[1:45:15] you think there'll be no attacks no
[1:45:17] hiccups no difficulties
[1:45:20] but he promised us the stabilizers are
[1:45:23] put on the ship
[1:45:25] she'll Crest every wave
[1:45:28] the stabilizers are put on the ship the
[1:45:30] demons will come the waves will toss
[1:45:32] they had they had Jesus asleep in the
[1:45:34] boat and the disciples out on the water
[1:45:36] and they said we'll get him now
[1:45:38] so those demons said we'll get him now
[1:45:42] but the stabilizers were on the ship
[1:45:43] Christ was in the boat
[1:45:46] they weren't going to get them now
[1:45:48] the disciples had even got separated
[1:45:50] from Christ he was on a mountain they
[1:45:51] were out in the sea and the same thing
[1:45:53] I'll get them now amen but he can never
[1:45:55] get him no matter how much trouble they
[1:45:57] brought he brought to them no matter how
[1:45:59] much they thought they were going to die
[1:46:00] any minute he could not do it until the
[1:46:03] purpose of God was finished
[1:46:06] and there's a purpose of God in our
[1:46:08] lives friends and the purpose of God in
[1:46:10] our lives it's not all these things we
[1:46:12] can entangle with but the purpose of God
[1:46:14] in our lives is to declare the mystery
[1:46:16] that was in the mind of God from the
[1:46:17] foundation of the world and that mystery
[1:46:19] is he will have a bride of his own
[1:46:21] choosing that'll be in his own likeness
[1:46:23] what is his own likeness the word she
[1:46:25] will be a word bride obeying the word
[1:46:28] following the word standing with the
[1:46:29] word preaching the word speaking the
[1:46:31] word proclaiming the word
[1:46:33] living the word
[1:46:36] she will be there
[1:46:38] in the Splendor of him
[1:46:46] praise God
[1:46:49] read this last sentence I just read in
[1:46:52] this quote from Christ the disregard
[1:46:53] revealed and go to the scripture here
[1:46:56] Christ in you
[1:46:58] makes you the complete revelation of the
[1:47:01] whole thing
[1:47:02] I I don't know I can't say that enough
[1:47:05] Christ in you
[1:47:07] makes you
[1:47:11] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:47:13] thing
[1:47:14] see what God is trying to do
[1:47:17] what is the new birth then
[1:47:19] you said well brother Venom what is the
[1:47:21] new birth it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:47:23] Christ personally to you
[1:47:28] I would say it this way
[1:47:30] the present tense revelation of Jesus
[1:47:33] Christ personally to you
[1:47:36] amen now you join the church you shook a
[1:47:39] hand you've done something different you
[1:47:41] said a Creed you promised to live by
[1:47:42] Coda rules but Christ the Bible he is
[1:47:45] the word that was revealed to you and no
[1:47:47] matter what anybody says what takes
[1:47:49] place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever
[1:47:51] it might be it's Christ in you that is
[1:47:54] the Revelation that the church was built
[1:47:56] upon
[1:47:57] now let's go to first John
[1:48:01] and we're going to find out what all the
[1:48:03] fight is about
[1:48:06] um
[1:48:08] first John
[1:48:19] first John chapter 4. verse 1.
[1:48:24] beloved believe not every Spirit but try
[1:48:27] the spirits
[1:48:28] whether they are of God because many
[1:48:30] false prophets are gone out into the
[1:48:32] world
[1:48:33] hereby know you the spirit of God every
[1:48:36] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[1:48:38] is come in the flesh is of God
[1:48:46] this is what the whole spiritual war
[1:48:49] today is over
[1:48:52] that that spirit that cannot confess
[1:48:55] that Jesus Christ is present tense come
[1:48:58] in the flesh is not of God
[1:49:02] and that blows up the whole Kingdom of
[1:49:06] the devil
[1:49:07] all his false Notions all his false
[1:49:10] religions all his false worship it's all
[1:49:13] blasted apart right there
[1:49:16] because you know Christ in you is the
[1:49:18] revelation of the whole thing
[1:49:21] let's read it again hereby know you the
[1:49:22] spirit of God every spirit that
[1:49:24] confesses that Jesus Christ is come in
[1:49:26] the flesh is of God in every spirit that
[1:49:29] confesses not that Jesus Christ is come
[1:49:31] in the flesh is not of God and this is
[1:49:33] that Spirit of antichrist wherever you
[1:49:36] have heard that it should come
[1:49:38] and even now already is it in the world
[1:49:40] year of God little children and have
[1:49:43] overcome them because greater is he that
[1:49:45] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:49:50] this scripture
[1:49:56] this day
[1:49:57] this scripture
[1:50:00] is made manifest before your eyes
[1:50:04] and this is the scripture
[1:50:07] that Satan does not want
[1:50:10] out
[1:50:11] this is the Revelation that he's
[1:50:13] fighting this is the trumpet that has
[1:50:15] declared spiritual war in this day and
[1:50:17] this is the Battleground
[1:50:21] it exposes the Antichrist spirit
[1:50:27] says remember
[1:50:29] we're not on a picnic
[1:50:30] we're in a Battlefield
[1:50:33] don't forget that friends
[1:50:36] I think we get the wrong idea sometimes
[1:50:38] of being a soldier for Christ
[1:50:42] because
[1:50:43] we think sometimes a soldier for Christ
[1:50:45] means no fatigue no shell shock no
[1:50:48] wounds
[1:50:50] no shortages all right I'm a soldier for
[1:50:53] Christ what that means in our
[1:50:55] imagination a soldier for Christ means I
[1:50:58] got I got I got everything perfect and
[1:51:00] all I do is just stick my gun over the
[1:51:02] book of pow Devil Falls pow pow
[1:51:03] everything perfect you know I never get
[1:51:05] scared never get hurt never have a bad
[1:51:07] day my sleeping quarters are good my
[1:51:09] rations are great
[1:51:13] but Paul tells Timothy to endure
[1:51:14] hardness as a soldier
[1:51:17] because this is a battle with all the
[1:51:21] things that happen in the battlefield
[1:51:23] shell shock and weariness
[1:51:25] exhaustion fatigue fear
[1:51:30] right
[1:51:32] these things all come the greater is he
[1:51:34] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:51:36] world
[1:51:37] there's nothing going to overcome that
[1:51:39] Seed Life on the inside that Life of
[1:51:41] Christ that's the thing that has Victory
[1:51:43] upon Victory upon victory
[1:51:47] okay
[1:51:50] brother Branham said
[1:51:52] in the true Easter seal the Christian
[1:51:54] doesn't ask for easy things
[1:51:56] there's so much promises today made
[1:51:58] amongst Christian people so many
[1:52:00] ministers promise that people a false
[1:52:02] thing if you'll just come to Christ all
[1:52:04] your troubles is settled I tell you when
[1:52:06] you come to Christ then they begin
[1:52:11] that's when you put on a uniform and
[1:52:13] take a gun and enter the battlefield the
[1:52:15] Christian road is not a flower bed of
[1:52:17] ease it's a battle from the very hour
[1:52:19] you start until your spirit set free by
[1:52:21] Death
[1:52:23] you are not at a picnic you're on a
[1:52:25] Battlegrounds and so we are promised
[1:52:28] these things
[1:52:31] amen
[1:52:33] I think we should start encouraging each
[1:52:34] other differently than we encourage each
[1:52:36] other now
[1:52:37] so now sometimes when somebody says oh
[1:52:40] brother I'm feeling terrible i've got
[1:52:41] this or that in my body and we say oh
[1:52:43] I'm so sorry for you and I think we
[1:52:45] should start saying hey you're not on a
[1:52:47] picnic
[1:52:49] [Laughter]
[1:52:52] oh brother there's this guy at work and
[1:52:55] he's just on he's eating them a nurse
[1:52:57] he's digging at me all the time and
[1:52:58] creating chaos for me all the time and
[1:53:00] man we say oh brother I'm so sorry I
[1:53:02] mean maybe you can get a new job
[1:53:05] let's change our language and say Hey
[1:53:06] brother you're not on a picnic
[1:53:10] this is a Battlefield
[1:53:12] and you say oh you know my brother all
[1:53:15] sister sons are having so many things
[1:53:17] are going wrong the kids just won't
[1:53:19] listen everything seems to be breaking
[1:53:21] at the same time my husband doesn't
[1:53:22] understand he's not giving me the
[1:53:24] support I need I I I'm falling to pieces
[1:53:27] sister you look at another one if you're
[1:53:29] brave enough
[1:53:31] we'll see how many sisters try this
[1:53:34] and say Sister We're Not on a picnic
[1:53:39] but if we could remember that friends
[1:53:40] the problem is we get the wrong idea of
[1:53:43] what a Christian Life is we get a wrong
[1:53:44] idea well with a wrong expectation and a
[1:53:47] wrong expectation always brings
[1:53:49] disappointment
[1:53:51] that's why so many times we can have pep
[1:53:54] rally Christianity but pep rally
[1:53:55] Christianity is not the reality
[1:53:58] and now I'm not against I'm not against
[1:54:00] an encouraging message and encouragement
[1:54:01] and pre-reaching the promises because
[1:54:03] sometimes we need to be reminded that I
[1:54:05] don't have to take this I can claim the
[1:54:07] word and the word will overcome
[1:54:09] if we just if we just stay in that pep
[1:54:12] rally moment we don't realize that this
[1:54:14] is a battlefield we're not asking for
[1:54:15] easy stuff it's supposed to be hard
[1:54:18] it's supposed to be a battle and if I'm
[1:54:20] fighting a battle and it comes hard well
[1:54:22] I just recognize it's supposed to be
[1:54:23] hard
[1:54:24] if things get difficult I just recognize
[1:54:26] it's supposed to be difficult it's not
[1:54:28] supposed to be easy it's not supposed to
[1:54:30] be a flowery bed of ease it's not
[1:54:32] supposed to be comfortable it's not
[1:54:33] supposed to be nice this is supposed to
[1:54:35] be spiritual warfare where all of hell
[1:54:38] has broke out on the earth and what is
[1:54:40] that going to look like in my life
[1:54:43] [Applause]
[1:54:44] with the right expectation amen then all
[1:54:47] of a sudden we can take disappointment
[1:54:49] the poison that comes with
[1:54:51] disappointment and doubt and
[1:54:53] questionings
[1:54:55] and say devil this doesn't mean I'm not
[1:54:57] a child of God this is the perfect
[1:54:59] example the perfect testimony of the
[1:55:03] fact that I'm a Child of God
[1:55:07] the devil will afflict you hard and then
[1:55:09] make you doubt whether God loves you or
[1:55:10] not or not that whether you're the
[1:55:12] economy of God and you should just look
[1:55:14] at him and say devil if I'm not part of
[1:55:16] God why do you bother me so bad
[1:55:21] leave me alone
[1:55:23] but there's a reason there's a reason
[1:55:27] he's trying to destroy the thing that's
[1:55:28] a threat to his kingdom
[1:55:36] brother Madam says
[1:55:40] in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:55:43] this great first battle that was ever
[1:55:45] fought begin in heaven
[1:55:46] when Michael and his angels fought
[1:55:48] against Lucifer and his angels it first
[1:55:50] started the first battle was in heaven
[1:55:51] so sin did not originate on Earth it
[1:55:55] originated in heaven
[1:55:57] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[1:55:59] cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell
[1:56:01] on human beings then the battle from
[1:56:03] Angels became human battles and Satan
[1:56:05] came to destroy God's creation what God
[1:56:07] had created to be for herself
[1:56:09] he had Satan come to destroy this that's
[1:56:12] what his purpose was was to destroy it
[1:56:15] then the battle began here on Earth and
[1:56:18] begin
[1:56:20] in US
[1:56:23] and has been raging ever since
[1:56:27] where's the battle at
[1:56:30] in US
[1:56:33] why does the battle feel so intense at
[1:56:35] times because you're the Battleground
[1:56:38] you're you're the place he's fighting
[1:56:42] he they facing off two forces are facing
[1:56:45] off in the mind of man
[1:56:47] in everything everything is at stake
[1:56:51] everything
[1:56:53] all of creation
[1:56:55] the devil's Kingdom and the kingdom of
[1:56:58] God it's all here at this end time in
[1:57:01] this final facing off
[1:57:04] but God has promised
[1:57:07] he's promised
[1:57:09] that there'll be a bride who will not
[1:57:12] fall
[1:57:14] she will make that last glorious stand
[1:57:17] because she'll stand on the word and the
[1:57:19] word only
[1:57:20] not on feelings not on circumstances but
[1:57:23] on the revelation of the word
[1:57:26] when everything looks wrong
[1:57:29] she'll still believe everything's all
[1:57:31] right
[1:57:32] when everything looks like it's failing
[1:57:34] she'll still declare that God is winning
[1:57:40] promise
[1:57:41] for this hour
[1:57:43] one last scripture will close Romans 16.
[1:57:55] Romans 16 verse 20.
[1:57:59] super familiar I've read it a lot here
[1:58:01] but I'll probably read it a lot more
[1:58:05] and the God of Peace shall Bruce Satan
[1:58:07] under your feet shortly
[1:58:11] that word bruise we talk about this all
[1:58:13] the time but it means to shiver a
[1:58:15] splinter into pieces it's not a small
[1:58:16] bruise it's a destruction
[1:58:19] and the God of Peace shall Brew Satan
[1:58:22] under your feet shortly
[1:58:24] and you wonder why the devil's after you
[1:58:28] you wonder why the devil's hounding you
[1:58:30] and he's coming after you and trying to
[1:58:32] destroy you it's because in the
[1:58:35] scripture
[1:58:36] it's promised that through you he will
[1:58:39] be destroyed
[1:58:41] and that's why he's trying so hard to
[1:58:43] destroy you
[1:58:46] let's all stand
[1:58:49] I think
[1:58:51] when we realize
[1:58:53] what's going on all around us
[1:58:57] we should just say
[1:58:59] this is what a battle looks like
[1:59:02] this is what spiritual warfare looks
[1:59:04] like
[1:59:06] an unexpecting a flowery bed of ease I'm
[1:59:09] not expecting comfort
[1:59:10] I'm expecting a battle
[1:59:13] but this battle has an expected outcome
[1:59:17] and all I've got to do is stay with the
[1:59:19] Revelation that God gave me don't turn
[1:59:21] to the right or to the left don't let
[1:59:23] the devil take out of your heart what
[1:59:25] you know to be true keep repeating it
[1:59:27] keep speaking it keep confessing it keep
[1:59:29] the word always on your lips keep the
[1:59:31] truth say I believe this message I am
[1:59:33] part of this message
[1:59:38] maybe every once I'll say it's me mama
[1:59:42] it's me
[1:59:44] I can't
[1:59:46] you know I I can't feel good in the
[1:59:49] flesh right now
[1:59:50] I can't
[1:59:52] I can't understand all the pieces
[1:59:56] but it's me Mama
[1:59:58] whatever's in that mirror it's me
[2:00:01] it's me you've chosen me this is the
[2:00:04] vessel that you want to finish you're
[2:00:06] working in this day and God I want you
[2:00:08] to finish in
[2:00:10] I want you to I I'm depending on you I
[2:00:13] can't do it in myself but you needed a
[2:00:15] vessel and this is your vessel you chose
[2:00:17] me I know you chose me I'm part of your
[2:00:19] kingdom I'm part of the end time bride
[2:00:24] God I'm pressing forward
[2:00:27] this Army's not in retreat
[2:00:30] doesn't matter how shell-shocked and
[2:00:33] it doesn't matter how fearful and how
[2:00:35] overwhelming the forces see this Army is
[2:00:38] not in Retreat she's a mighty marching
[2:00:41] Army she's an invincible Army not that
[2:00:43] she cannot be damaged not that she
[2:00:45] cannot suffer harm and that's not what
[2:00:47] makes her Invincible it's not because
[2:00:49] she's Untouchable she's Invincible
[2:00:51] because no matter what she will not be
[2:00:53] defeated in this day
[2:00:55] nothing shall stop the purpose of God
[2:00:59] from coming forth in our lives and the
[2:01:02] purpose of God in this day is to brew
[2:01:04] Satan under your feet shortly and God is
[2:01:07] going to do it and he's going to use
[2:01:09] these vessels to do it and I'm going to
[2:01:10] stand fast while he does it
[2:01:13] say God help us
[2:01:16] help us God
[2:01:18] I pray that God gives us revelation of
[2:01:20] this an understanding
[2:01:22] so that we know what's going on all
[2:01:24] around us don't don't let the devil lie
[2:01:27] we know what's happening we know this is
[2:01:30] spiritual warfare we know this is the
[2:01:33] result of Hell being Unleashed on the
[2:01:34] earth and two hundred thousand thousand
[2:01:36] demons coming after the bride that's
[2:01:37] what this is
[2:01:39] not anything else it's not what the
[2:01:41] devil tells me it is that's what this is
[2:01:44] the result of hell trying to stop the
[2:01:47] progress of the Bride
[2:01:49] so that Satan can hold on to his kingdom
[2:01:51] a little longer
[2:01:53] and I want to serve the devil notice
[2:01:58] we're not quitting
[2:02:00] will never be defeated
[2:02:03] will never be stopped
[2:02:05] not because of Flesh or mind but because
[2:02:08] of a promise in the word
[2:02:11] and we know that that word is in her and
[2:02:15] her alone and there's no other options
[2:02:18] God has got to take these feet to
[2:02:21] destroy that devil soon

[2:02:38] Spirit but it's still me
[2:02:41] I get discouraged I get knocked down I I
[2:02:43] get disoriented sometimes I I sometimes
[2:02:47] run and try to hide in in a foxhole when
[2:02:50] I'm supposed to be fighting devil and I
[2:02:51] pray that God will forgive me but it's
[2:02:53] still me
