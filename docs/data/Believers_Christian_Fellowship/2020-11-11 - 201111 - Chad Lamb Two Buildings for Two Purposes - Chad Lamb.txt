good to see you this evening i mean while we're standing let's just go right into our bibles and turn to second peter and i appreciate the atmosphere the song service and all those who worship it's good to see your faces man let's look at second peter chapter one i want to continue looking in the book of genesis for a little bit i've really been enjoying genesis just going back and looking at some of these things again and none of the things we talk about or look at are are i guess brand new or something that would be shocking but it's just so good to look at them again and see what comes to light when we look at it again and before we turn there i just want to say i got good reports from the youth camp out over the weekend this past weekend they enjoyed that and brother joseph scott gave us testimony to the youth and they really enjoyed that so thank you brother joe and amen thank you brother kyle and sister kerry for putting that on it was a good time amen it makes me wish i was youth again but my youth days are coming back soon with a new body amen second peter chapter one verse two grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust it's the last part of that verse that we talked about before but i can't get away from we've been made partakers of his divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust because all the corruption that has come into the world has come through lust and by his divine nature we have escaped them amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you we thank you father that we can come here and we can put all of our little licks of fire together lord we can warm one another in this atmosphere in this blaze lord we can enjoy your presence and enjoy worshiping you together nor may you be pleased with our worship lord as we turn to the word now lord as we read these scriptures and we look at what your prophet has taught us lord i pray that you would just open it to us give us eyes to see in ears to hear lord may we grow today lord may you feed us from your own hand and may we grow spiritually lord to become what you want us to be in this hour may we overcome by the word lord i pray to feed your sheep and have preeminence among us and take your liberty amongst us this evening in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all have your seats uh we'll turn to genesis chapter five and go back here and look in genesis chapter five i want to read a quote quickly here in the message faith from 1956 the prophet of god says and everything that we've got here today began in genesis that's why i've enjoyed this study of genesis so much and taking our time and just going through and looking at it because i i feel like personally like brother branham said this is the seed chapter of the whole bible and everything that begins in genesis amen works its way all the way through the bible where there's two there's two vines that begin to move down through here and i feel like if if you can begin to see it and comprehend it and understand it see the beginning and see how it acts and see the nature of it you can spot it everywhere amen so we see how it begins we see the nature of it in the beginning we see how the vine began to move and intertwine and begin to wrap its its itself around the word and move down through and you begin to see nothing's ever changed it's the same thing it was then as it is now and god has equipped us to overcome he said genesis is the seed book or the crop book where god planted first and satan planted the tares and it all comes down as a vine growing up and today we're at the harvest time of the whole thing but every cult that we got on the earth today with time and historians like hislops to babylon josephus and many of the early writers we could go back there and prove every cult with uh every action that it's got begin in genesis and the church of the living god begin in genesis so i'm not just going to find the origin of every cult but i'm going to find my origin in genesis amen it says so the vines are growing right up but by their fruit you know what they are by what they produce maybe lord willing i'll speak on it one night before we leave the true and false vine then he says in israel in the church part four for this is the day brethren you'll bear me record a day of isms i've been studying genesis now for two years of genesis that's the beginning the going forth the seed chapter and you notice that all those cults of this day are beginning in genesis they had their start back in genesis winding up out here in the last day for instance many of them like how the formal religion begin and came how it come on out and come down through the sons of noah ham out of ham he had nimrod nimrod bit that built the tower of babel babel comes on down through king nebuchadnezzar's time and on out into revelations babylon how that little seed started way back there at the east side of the gates of eden coming on down winding out all kinds of cults and everything started back there winding themselves out to the end all the way back when came offering the wrong kind of worship to god a cain of his own desire of his own choosing of his own reasoning began to start a kind of worship amen that would continue all the way down through and you'll find it all the way in the book of revelations in chapter 17. started at the very beginning goes all the way to the end so let's look at genesis chapter five and for a subject tonight i want to talk about two buildings for two purposes two buildings for two purposes so it's very easy to understand what we're going to talk about there's going to be two there's going to be two buildings that are constructed and they're for two different purposes and these two buildings are going to straddle the flood one before and one after we want to talk about two buildings and two purposes genesis chapter 5 verse 21 and enoch lived 65 years and began begotten methuselah and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah 300 years and begot sons and daughters and all the days of enoch were 360 and five years and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him so here we have an introduction to the seventh from adam this man named enoch and we know by the scriptures he is a prophet jude tells us that he prophesied he was the seventh from adam jude chapter 1 verse 14. he says enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of thee saying behold the lord cometh when ten thousand of his saints so enoch was prophesying of the return of the lord he was prophesying of our day he was prophesying in the end time all the way back in the beginning he was the seventh from adam brother adam tells us he's a type of the the seventh church age amen and there's going to be a rapture in the seventh church age and so he begins to type all this out and we get introduced to this enoch keep your place in genesis and let's turn to hebrews 11 together we want to read about this brother enoch hebrews 11 and 5. by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god and we know that the scripture tells us that after he begot methuselah he walked with the lord 300 years so in his walking with the lord he pleased the lord he said that he pleased god but verse 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of him that diligently seek him so now we find out this mystery of the walk with god because he he walked with the lord but it says that that before he was translated he was found that that uh it says here that before his translation god before god translated before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god so enoch pleased god but there's only one way to please god and the only way you can please god is by faith so enoch amen we're going to talk about enoch we're going to talk about the pyramid that he built because brother benham tells us that enoch built the great pyramid amen in egypt and and enoch built that structure amen but it wasn't enoch's works that pleased god amen it was enoch's faith that pleased god and so we want to talk about this and look at this but i want to go to one other scripture in isaiah we can go to isaiah 19. isaiah 19 and verse 19 in that day shall there be an altar to the lord in the midst of the land of egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord so at the border of egypt there's a pillar unto the lord and that pillar is the pyramid [Music] a pillar at the border there to the lord and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of the host in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressors and he shall send them a savior and a great one and he shall deliver them amen so brother brahm says in the in the message adoption part 4 from 1960 it says god wrote three bibles one of them was the zodiac in the skies that's the first bible man was to look up to realize that god is from above follow the zodiac did you ever study it it even gives every age even the cancer age it gives the beginning the birth of christ what is the figure in the first figure in the zodiac the virgin what's the last figure leo the lion the first coming and second coming of christ all of it's written in there then the next bible was written was in stone called pyramid god wrote in the pyramids if you study them watch the ancient histories and wars how they were built before the antediluvian destruction the third was wrote on paper the bible for the great smart intellectual world to come now as god has moved down through the age we're at leo the lion we're at the capping of the pyramid we're in the book of revelations at the last chapter amen brother branham says there's three bibles amen the zodiac the the pyramid amen and the and then the the written bible that we have in paper but he but brother bam is going to be very clear he's now in 1960 adoption he's preaching he says now we've come to leo the lion so he's pointing to the first bible and shows you where we are in the bible he points to the second one he says now we're at the capping time of the pyramid and then he points to this bible he says now we're in the book of revelation in the last chapter hey i don't know about you but it looks like the end of the book the end of the book the end of the book amen so it doesn't matter which book you look at which gospel he wrote amen we're at the end of the book and the message perseverant from 64 says noah was living in a scientific age when they was perhaps could shoot at the moon with radar jesus said it was a day like this as it was in the days of noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man now we know down in egypt we see these pyramids we could not reproduce them today we have no power to do it they had a hold of atomic power or some kind of power that built the pyramids we couldn't put these boulders up there by no means neither could we reproduce that sphinx there is no way of doing it we don't have the material to make a mummy embalm a body that looks even natural for thousands of years we've lost that art a dye that won't fade out many many things they had then that we are completely blind of and they built that pyramid so setting so sinner in the earth no matter where the sun is there's never a shadow around it never a shadow at the pyramid oh the architecture the instruments they had is far beyond now i read this for a purpose because we know that that noah lived in a scientific day we understand that uh brother ben starts talking about they had advanced science more advanced than our science and our science is growing fast because it's got to match that day amen as it was in the day of noah so it has to be in this day in the coming of the son of man so but the reason i want to look at that is because brother brahm told us that cain's line amen were smart and shrewd and intellectual and scientific and they had all of this development and all this technology amen and in seth's line were simple sheepherders and farmers and all that amen but but you realize enoch built the pyramid and he used technology he said they built that pyramid with some sort of atomic power or something that we don't have today amen and when when noah amen when noah built the ark amen there was a lot of technology that went into that ark amen to get it constructed to hold up to the rain to the waves to the wind to whatever beating it was going to be it had to be constructed it had to be engineered it had to take the abuse it had to hold up for the duration amen it had to have enough room enough chambers it had to have a place for storing food a way for collecting water amen a way to get light on the inside i mean there was a lot of technology in there amen and in the pyramid it took a lot of technology to build the pyramid it was precisely measured it was accurately surveyed amen it was leveled on a level plane amen there's a lot of technology that went into that amen and so when we look at you know they're simple sheepherders and farmers it doesn't mean that god can't pluck up a sheep herder and a farmer and do marvelous things with them things that are breathtaking things that are standing to this day when most everything else that a man has made has crumbled and fallen to ruin amen but there's a pyramid still standing there that was made by a simple sheepherder or farmer amen because the simple sheep of her farmer wasn't using his own mind amen he wasn't using his own mind he wasn't using his own intellect amen enoch was not the architect of that pyramid god was the architect of that pyramid but he was a prophet who could catch the dimensions who could catch the technique who could catch what god wanted amen and he would do it the way god said do it maybe he didn't even understand why he was doing it that way but all he had to do was do it the way it was shown to him the way the father said and if he did it that way there would be a monument that would be standing as a pillar in egypt for a sign today so it doesn't mean hey we use technology to spread the word of god amen we we use internet and we use all kinds of you know i don't even know the name of the stuff that we use but it's not about figuring out it's not about being wise it's not about the wisdom of man it's about the simplicity to do what god says do and watch the miraculous follow watch the amazement i mean how many times what we'll say this way i'll use it for an example you know so many times you make choices in life and you don't know why you're doing it but god shuts the door he opens a door he gives you a check or he gives you a green line and you don't know why but you'll buy that property or you'll sell this one or you'll hold off or you'll buy this car you don't have a good feeling about that one amen you don't have the wisdom to figure it out but you've got the leadership of the holy ghost and many times we've made decisions sometimes because we got forced into a corner sometimes because we had no other choice amen but we knew god was in charge we knew god was our father and we moved forward anyways and 10 years later you find out that was the only choice that would work that was the only thing and people say how did you know to sell then how did you know not to sell then how did you know to wait and all the prices were going to come down you can say all i was doing was watching the sheep see mankind wants to be smart you know the thing that we fight is that old hybrid nature within us that wants to be somebody wants to act like we know we got our act together i knew i was watching the market and i knew that these key indicators i was going to pull the trigger and double my money my goodness if you're a son of god he'll let you lose your money because he wants the leadership i think you know watching this trend this is going i'm going to buy this and i'm going to buy a bunch of these all these widgets because in in five years everybody's going to want these widgets and you know what happened five years from later now to go the other way and you'll have a trailer load of widgets that nobody wants i mean we had people buying beanie babies because they're going to be worth millions who wants a beanie baby today these are going to be collector's items there's going to be a hot market it was a hot market for a year or two but so many times in our lives by the leadership of god sometimes without us even knowing it just the circumstances of life amen god leads in a way we would have never chose we couldn't figure out we didn't understand but it was perfect where we went to school what job we got when we started when we stopped amen it was perfect amen it was perfect and it works out perfect and it's beyond stellar the way it works out amen and we could be just as mesmerized as noah was when he finished the boat and it worked it floated amen and it worked and it was comfortable and it was dry and there's room for all the animals and everything god told him to build fit just right and there was the right amount of room for all the animals and he never had to count animals he never had to count space he didn't have to do square footage calculations but if he built the way god said i mean by the time all the animals were gathered in seven pairs of clean animals a pair of unclean animals amen there was room for them all food enough for the entire journey i don't know how noah may not have known how we've got to follow the leadership of the lord and now enoch builds this pyramid and he is one of those simple brother venom said all of seth's line was simple maybe he said maybe ignorant when he talked about noah i mean illiterate sheepherders and farmers i tell you friends we don't have to have life figured out we just have to stick with the word and let the word let the word do its own work brother rem says in the true easter seal from 1961 so there's no top on the pyramid what is it enoch built it before the flood it was a memorial that's the reason never destroyed during the time of the flood there's nothing destroyed it because it is a memorial so god had it built to be a memorial he intended it for it to stay he intended it for to be in a memorial amen if you think about it that structure that giant structure survived the flood it was built in such a way that it would survive the flood god knew the flood was coming amen when god had enoch building he built it to survive the flood and so you can see how after the flood maybe those who who who you know after the destruction and known as family come out and men begin to multiply on the face of the earth and the story of the destruction and the story of the flood is passed down amen but the people can see that there's still this pyramid that survived and that pyramid it made it through amen because the word of god is not destroyed by the judgment of god the word of god will stand amen and there's a judgment coming to this earth a judgment of fire but the word of god and all the attributes all the word of god you and i and every seed of god are going to make it through the judgment and be still standing that pyramid that city that temple that tabernacle will be standing on the other side because god built this one god's the architect of this building we're the lively stones that he's shaped by the word amen and what does he use to do it amen who built that pyramid god built that pyramid but he used enoch amen and god has built this church amen through seven church ages god has done it but he's done it through apostles and prophets and pastors and teachers and evangelists and he's done it through brothers and sisters because iron sharpeneth iron so there's a man sharpened at the countenance of his friend and god has used people to build this pyramid of his bride and it'll stand the destruction it'll be on the other side brother brahma goes on and talk about this pyramid in the 70 weeks of daniel he says now then after that age lived by the wesleyan age come in the pentecostal age with the baptism of the holy ghost see you're shaping up all the time now remember that headstone wasn't on it yet why they they shaped the church exactly or their pyramid in shape to fit the headstone oh friends catch that they they the pyramid is shaped to fit the headstone the headstone is not shaped to fit the pyramid and the pyramid is the body of the church and the headstone is christ amen and the church has been built over seven church ages to fit the headstone amen the headstone is not adjusting to the church the church is being shaped to fit into the headstone we're growing up unto all things unto the head which is christ so god has been shaping god has been building amen he's been building his his tabernacle with the living stones but brother abraham says you know why didn't they put the pyramid on and then they can't cap or when they put the cap they can't put the cap on till the end but you realize the cap had to be known from the beginning the revelation of the capstone has to be primary because the whole building is building to the measurement of the capstone so there must be the revelation of the capstone first before the building amen you can never build the building to match the headstone amen that's why christ came first the headstone came first and he became the cornerstone now the cornerstone will become the head of the corner the headstone amen so now everything is building into christ and that's how this pyramid was built so now there's a there's a mystery laying there amen and when especially us as believers when we look at the pyramid the attraction in the pyramid is the missing piece i mean it's amazing structure you walk up to it and what it would have looked like before they took the casing stones off i can't imagine it would have been smooth limestone white on polished white it would show it would shine and the sunlight and it would almost glow it must have been an amazing sight to see it was humongous it was perfect it was perfectly smooth it reflected perfectly amen but there's no way after walking around and looking at this it doesn't take very long to your your attraction your attention goes to the part that's missing because there's a hidden mystery and the mystery is the missing piece the mystery is the capsule and the mystery is the seventh seal amen same thing for us he's building it building it building it because the great climax is the coming of christ the cap off his pyramid he said the pyramid is shaped to fit the headstone that means when the plane is leveled it's leveled with the headstone in mind it has to be because you have to know how wide to make the base and what angle you're going to make it to match the angles of the headstone so when they're clearing the base and they're laying the limestone foundation or whatever stone i don't remember what stone it was they're clearing a plane a huge plane and they're getting huge stones in there for the foundation to support this weight they enoch already has a revelation of the capstone before he ever starts clearing the land everything that's done through the bible friends remember this is the second bible amen everything that's done in the building of this bible the writing of this bible everything has to do with the headstone it's all built to the headstone it's all built with the headstone in mind it's all built to this grand final climax of the headstone uniting with the body and the whole bible is written for that moment for that purpose everything you read has the headstone in mind everything that's written all the foundation the seed chapter that was laid everything that god said and did in shadows and times it all has the capstone in mind it's all about the seventh seal it's all about the captain the head connecting with the body everything we read he said but the headstone never did come oh you see where i'm at don't you the ministry from luther until the end of pentecost in that little bitty minority up there that's the reason the light almost goes out in the age there on the calendar on the chart it's the pentecostal age the pentecost are not the pentecostal denominations because they've done just exactly like the laodicean they are laodicean they did like the nicolaitans organized but the true church all over the world is shaped down to a place there's come a ministry among them just exactly like the ministry of jesus christ now what they got they got the thing in condition now what's the next thing this rejected stone to the pyramid cut out of the mountain without what without hands god sent it do you see it the rejected one the rejected stone is the head is the head the capstone and everyone they rejected through this gentile ages is christ and the very ones are the very one that they rejected through this gentile age is christ christ is the rejected stone and christ was not cut out and put there as a vicar or a son of god or some great dignitary in the church i want you to listen this he said the hat the headstone's not going to be a pope a great dignitary a vicar this is he's talking about christ the rejected stone he said he's not i won't read this again christ was not cut out and put in here as vicar or son or son of god or some great dignitary in the church he's the holy spirit and the cap of the pyramid will be christ coming well what way will he be coming it'll be the full measure of the holy spirit back in the church again the capstone do you see it amen 1962 in the message perseverance so the church now if the headstone comes in luther's time look what out of the way place it would have been so if you're building the pyramid and you're only getting so far and you stop and you try to put the headstone down there it doesn't fit it can't come to the right time look if it come in wesley's time it'll come in its own predestinated time but the church will be joined will be honed in such a condition until the church ministry will be so close and be just exactly the same kind of ministry that jesus had to make it all fit together for the rapture like the head knows more than the feet see the eyes are more in use than the feet the eyes is a prophet of the church it foresees and all these things come in the head the head part so if the eyes were here that's the head part the headship was coming the son of man amen the son of man ministry was coming the capstone was coming the holy ghost was coming back in the church so we know as this great pyramid was built it was actually the second bible being written and it was all written with the seventh seal in mind it was all written with the capstone with christ in mind everything was done in preparation everything was built and fashioned according to the capstone and and they took stones amen took stones and the stones were shaped and placed and each stone had a place and not all the stones are the same shape so there's there's all kinds of stones of irregular shape and and different dimensions in different ways amen because god was going to make amen this this temple out of a mini-member body you and i and his peace taking the stones and he's not creating anything enoch is not recreating anything all enoch is doing is taking what god's placed in the earth and he's shaping it he's not changing what it is he's shaping it to fit into its place when we came to the earth amen the word is shaping us to fit into our predestinated place so he's he he's just shaping he's just taking the stone and shaping it and putting it to its place and i believe it was all done by revelation and everything was built for the headstone and then we had the flood and and god would pull out another simple shepherd and no one he would begin to give him dimensions of a boat and the technology of the boat and the construction of a boat and tell them what kind of wood to use and how to pitch it inside and out and how to prepare it then we would have a flood that would destroy would destroy what man's made would destroy man off the face of the earth amen but that testimony that memorial will live on but after the flood right after when men begin to populate we see that men congregate together to build another building of great magnitude and that's the one i want to look at now and brother brahma says in the message oneness from 1962 said a false union brought judgment on the earth to even adam in eden and a false union brought the floods of god's judgment on the earth because the daughters of cain flirted with the sons of god and they fell for it and united together again there you are false union nothing could nothing could happen what did god do he destroyed the whole thing all but precious old noah and his family they got together and again after that after the death of noah that spiritual family of noah first thing you know the children of man began to look at one another again what did they do they said now we're not infidels we all believe in god pay attention we all believe in god and these are going to be primarily directed by the sons of ham ham begot cush cush begotten nimrod nimrod's the one who's going to build this this tower of babel and this is what we're getting into now but he says we're not infidels we all believe in god so the foundation of the tower of babel was not that was not based on uh uh some new uh deity it was it was saying we believe in god we believe in the one god we believe in the god who created all things so so look at the foundation so they got a fellow by a leader some great archbishop by the name of nimrod and they built a tower i love how brother branham mixes these terminologies he's talking about nimrod and he calls him an archbishop or a bishop one place i think it was if i remember right he called him a pope what's brother brahm trying to do he's trying to take the story of nimrod and plant it right here today so we don't miss the whole point of the story this is the seed this is the beginning of the catholic church and false religion amen and now this is the beginning of the the and the harlots amen but it started off by saying hey we're not infidels we all believe in god so they got this great archbishop by the name of nimrod and they built a tower they wasn't infidels but they believed there was a heaven they believed there was a hell they believed in judgments but the children of god were the daughters of man again and they made themselves a union falsely and built a great big cathedral a great big organization and all the other places was to babel was to pay tribute to it and they said i tell you what we can do you know we're smart where'd they get that wisdom from the devil this wasn't the simple sheep herder smart this wasn't the simple sheep herder amen that can construct a building that would be the second bible written that would make it through the judgment of god this was a different kind of wisdom a different kind of smart one one was wise by humility by simplicity and one was wise by a demonic anointing there's two kind of wisdom there's the wisdom that comes from god the wisdom of god and that always comes through humility and simplicity the wisdom of god comes when you say i know nothing when you say i can't figure it out i don't understand it i don't know what to do next i don't know what the right choice is i'm all tangled up on the inside and god if you don't show me the way i can't take a step and then all of a sudden the wisdom of god comes down in the leadership of the holy ghost amen you pick that foot up and he puts it right down in the right spot and all of a sudden you find out the walk is ordained so there's a two different kinds of wisdom here he says you know we're smart where they get that wisdom from the devil that's exactly they got it from the devil like eve did got it from the devil so they said we'll build ourself an organization will please god oh this is cain's religion moving on cain's religion more advanced will please god and i'll tell you what we'll do we'll all have little stair steps we'll run up and sing and enjoy with the angels and come back down here and live the way we want to look at this the the reason this is so important amen what brother benham is telling us he's not just telling us the story of nimrod he's showing us the seed the beginning how this thing started and we'll get into religion where people will go out on a drinking drunken spree with adultery and all of that on a friday night as long as they can go to the confessional booth on saturday and confess it what are they doing they're climbing up the tower of babel to go to heaven to sing to come back down to earth to live any way they want you say well that's the catholic church i tell your friends the protestants are guilty of the same thing and we can be guilty of it in the message too i do my religious duty i do my devotion i say i believe the message but i still at the core of it do what i want to do anyways the truth friends seen people make choices amen that are contrary to the word of god contrary to the message amen but they'll stay religious amen and they'll stay in the church or stay in the message amen and if one church doesn't accept their unbelief amen and their disobedience to the word they'll just leave that church and go find another one and stay there why because they want a tower of babel they don't want a relationship with god [Applause] so we don't want to just say confessional booth amen and you know we that's a clear-cut example amen but the devil's a lot trickier than that amen he's going to slip in if he can get us to build our own tower of babel and we can take the message and manipulate it to our own understanding and build our own tower where we feel like we can climb up and sing with the angels amen and go back down and live any way we want it doesn't work that way amen i mean we've seen the scene with my own eyes i've seen and then things change since we come into the message dress and attire and attitudes and activities places we used to not want to go to restaurants we wouldn't go into amen and places vacations we wouldn't take amen and we act in ways and do things and play games and dress in ways we just not when we come to the message 20 years ago we wouldn't do it maybe we just got smarter i don't want to be smarter i don't want to live my own life i want to surrender my life i want to be that simple sheep herder says god i don't know i get so tangled up in myself sometimes i think i'm right and i find out i'm wrong sometimes i think i'm righteous and i find out it's only selfishness god you've got to judge me god you've got to take your word and shape me i can't do this on my own amen i want to surrender i want to be simple amen i want to labor in the word and i don't i want to take your word amen and i want to see it fit into its place don't want to i don't want to build a tower of babel [Music] don't want to build a religion that makes me feel satisfied why because they believed god they believed in a heaven they believed in a hell they believed in judgments i'll read that sentence again we'll run up and sing and enjoy with the angels and come back down here and live the way we want to the devil's still living see it was against the commandments of god they didn't keep his commandments what did god do well they built a tower of babel false again so god confused them and separated them they built a catholic church so god confused them and separated them through the protestant reformation he's done the same exact thing friends build a man-made religion amen took the new testament altered at nicolaitan cousin come in formed an organization built a catholic church amen and then god came down and confused it amen and separated them not into nations but in denominations and made it where they didn't understand one another's language the lutheran didn't understand the catholics and didn't understand the baptism didn't understand the wesleyans the pentecostals didn't understand the lutherans but in the end time the devil's working is trickery to bring it right back to a tower of babel again there was a one world religion there was a one world government with a one world religion and there will be again because what started in genesis winds up the same in the end let's look at genesis chapter 10. verse 8. genesis 10 and 8 and kush begotten nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth i just think this language is so amazing when you look through the genealogies it doesn't say this about anybody else and when the bible says something and puts emphasis on it through repetition amen it's to draw your attention to something so let's read this and cushby got nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth and he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and eric and akkad and kaunai in the land of shinar and out of that land went forth asher and built in nineveh and in the church age book brother ben says he tells us that that's actually not correct translation he said he said out of that land he went forth to assyria and built nineveh so it's nimrod who built nineveh and the city rio both and kayla resin between nineveh and kayla the same is a great city it goes on to talk about some more of his accolades but but you realize now the bible when we're going through these genealogies amen it doesn't really tell us anything about cush amen amen although brother branham does in the church age book tells us about cushion but it doesn't it comes in nimrod and it said he began to be a mighty one in the earth now all of a sudden amen now the mighty one is not jehovah god is not the father god amen but now on the earth is rising up a mighty one now we're getting into a new dispensation where man will rule over man amen will they start to look to a strong one a mighty one to be their defender their protector their leader amen are no longer the leadership of the holy ghost no longer the leadership of god and so nimrod the name nimrod means rebellion rebellion when it says he became a mighty hunter before the lord this is not this is not a good connotation it's not like oh yeah he was a good hunter before the lord but it's almost it almost has that in the language that it almost denotes that he was a mighty hunter before or above amen the lord his fame began to grow he became mighty upon the earth and he became a mighty hunter before the lord not just in the presence of the lord but before the lord and people started to look to nimrod let's go look at chapter 11 verse 1. and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech [Music] we're quickly coming back to this the separation in languages is not so difficult as it used to be english is predominant but even if it's not you've got google translate on your phone i mean everything is translating so fast and now the earth is coming back to one language in one speech and not just one language in one one speech not just like everybody's speaking english but coming back to say the same thing the they're coming back to one way of thinking one frame of mind the whole earth is going to gather back to a certain mindset to a certain so so certain we need a mighty hunter we need a mighty one on the earth we need somebody to save us protect us help us lead us we're coming back to that friends and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had them from order and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach into heaven and let us take make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord come down to see the city in the tower which the children of men builded and the lord said behold the people is one and they all have one language in this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do look at the power of unity look at the power of unity go to let us go down there and confound their language and they may not understand one another's speech so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of the earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of the earth see they were actually going against the will of god to begin with because when god sent them forth out of the ark he told them to go and replenish the earth amen he actually wanted them to go forth and go abroad and go out and separate and go replenish the earth but what they wanted to do was congregate together because they wanted to make a name for themselves and build a great city and come up with their own protection and their own plan and their own worship they wanted to become mighty amen not humble sheepherders with just my family back here on the back side of this mountain because that's what god wanted god wanted the people spread abroad amen but they gathered together because they wanted something different than what god wanted amen that's why god wants local assemblies with a local pastor sovereign local assemblies independent from all others that's what god wants not conglomerations not collections of ideas not denomination god doesn't want that god wants us to spread abroad amen and he wants individual family units he wants individual churches with individual leadership and there's sovereignty led by the holy ghost so brother baby says in god's chosen place of worship he said nothing is typed in the old testament anywhere in the bible of the church but the forced unity of babel tower that's the only thing that types to unity because it was by nimrod a wicked man who went out and forced all the little countries to come into one place in this great tower it was a religious worship of course but not considered in the word of god so there is where you see denominational religion type the tower of babel in the old testament which this religion was certainly a religion but not the religion of the word of god in the pergament church age out of the church age book he says babel is the original name for babylon it means confusion it was literally started by cush the son of ham but was brought to a kingdom of power and grandeur under his son nimrod the mighty hunter nimrod according to the genesis 11 account and also according to profane history set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation outside the will of god see it sounds the human reasoning under the logic of the devil sounds good we want to build a strong nation god never told them to build a strong nation god didn't want them to build a strong nation he wanted them to scatter abroad and replenish the earth but he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did and he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished his accomplishments were so monumental that the kingdom of babylon was called the head of gold amongst all world governments that his religion gained prominence is proven by the fact that scriptures identify it with satan completely in isaiah chapter 14 and in revelations chapter 17 and 18. and by history we can prove that it invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatry and the theme of mythology though the names of the gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people so all mythology all idolatry all cults and all false religions started here because nimrod wanted to make a strong nation he wanted to propagate his own religion and he wanted to make a name for himself that sounds just like lucifer saying i will i will i will well the rope says in the message united under one head and god said in his word no man can come to me except my father draws him first you're seeking to find what's drawing you but it's god has to draw first the scripture says and how true it is but we find out here that they have united under one great leader and when you get man under leadership of man then he gets some ideas of his own trying to achieve something that he can design or do himself brother barron ties it in the catholic church with babylon and the message of serpent seed from 58 he said out there came ham him with his wife and he had a curse put on him from ham came nimrod who built babylon out of babylon come the catholic church the beginning of it now i want to look at this quote in the pergameon church age from the church age book it's out of the same section we quoted before it said monotheism turned to polytheism in babylon the worship of one god to multiple gods monotheism turned to polytheism in babylon the devil's lie and the devil's mysteries rose up against the truth of god and the mysteries of god in that city satan truly became the god of this world and exacted worship from those that he had duped caused them to believe that he was truly the lord see this is the danger of using your own reasoning this is the danger of going against a command from god and saying i want i want i want i think this is best i think we should do this i think this and the danger is that is that's the leadership from satan not from god because god will always lead you to stick with the word even if you don't understand even if it doesn't make sense and even if it looks like it's doomed for failure amen god the holy ghost will always keep you with the word even if it looks like it's going to completely fall you stay with the word but when you go down the path of taking your own mind and own wisdom we know that's just anointing of the devil amen and he he became the god of this world and exactly worship from those that he had do causing them to believe that he was truly the lord they were worshiping the devil but they believed he was truly the lord the polytheistic religion of the enemy began with the trinitarian doctrine it was way back there in antiquity that the one god and three persons idea came into existence so when brother branham is coming and he's teaching water baptism in jesus name and and the truth of the oneness of god what is he doing he's fighting this religion from all the way back in the tower of babel amen has moved all the way through and come through all of its various forms and traditions and got perfected amen down to a doctrine in the christian church and when brother benham comes out amen what's he doing he's restoring the truth amen from way back in genesis amen when everybody in the world believed in one god and he's bringing us back to the truth proverbs 14 12 says there was a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death that's not the way we want to go and god's provided place of worship from 1965 brother says and the people worship the devil don't even know what they're doing they worship the devil in churches teaching for doctrine the commandments of man creeds and tradition and then in he tells us there's people worshiping the devil and don't know it why how did we get to where we're worshiping the devil and don't know it the way we got there is we left off the commandment of god no matter how simple and humbled it looked to do something that seemed right in our own eyes that's how you get to worshiping the devil amen what they wanted to do was worship god what they thought they were doing was worshiping god but they were duped by the devil amen into believing that he was the lord and he was ex he was extracting their worship amen because god wasn't receiving their worship because they had left the word now listen to this thinking brother goes into in the end time evangelism said after noah had the ark and then immediately after that nimrod that renegade he built a tower and said if the floods would come we'll just climb up and get above it actually believing that they can circumvent the judgments of god actually believing that the judgments of god will not take effect on us because of our religion because of our tower because of our religion amen we will if if something happens we'll just stick with our religion amen and we'll bypass the judgment the judgment won't have effect on us because we'll stick with our religion nothing's changed everything remains the same let's go back and look at genesis 11 and verse 3. and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they have brick for stone and slime and they from mortar i mean when you come and look at this you come to a hundred percent man-made religion when when enoch built amen when he built the pyramid when he wrote the second bible he took what god had made and god had ordained and all he did was shape it they gave away god when it shaped and placed it where god wanted it placed amen but when we come to the tower of babel amen they make bricks and they bake them in the oven and they make slime for mortar it's a hundred percent man-made doctrines and creeds and traditions of man amen and they're trying to build something amen that will survive the flood amen but there's already a memorial set up that says this is what will survive the flood this is what will make it through the judgment this is what will survive and this is the only thing that will survive amen it is something that's inspired by god it is the word of god amen word upon word amen word by word that was built by the inspiration of god it survived the flood and now they're trying to replicate what god had done because that's what the devil has done in his religion in his false forms of worship he's trying to replicate the true word and the true form of worship and where did this start it started in genesis friends everything we see when you drive down the road and you see church after church after church and steeple after steeple amen and people living any way that they want to live in total disregard for the word of god but they'll go back into their tower of babel every sunday and they'll climb up the steps and sing with the angels and climb back down and live any way they want and believe that if the judgment was to come i will be spared from the judgment if i stick with this tower in every corner on every street there's a steeple and a light and a sign amen what is it towers of babel towers of babel towers of babel baked bricks man he dug something out of the word he manipulated and changed it in his own fashion he heated it up for his own purpose and he made brick for stone what does that mean instead of true revelation he came up with his own understanding of the word he took the spoken word of god which was the earth that was created by the spoken word of god and he took and he dug it and he manipulated and he changed it and he ground it and he put it together and he heated it up in his own oven to make to make and he said we have bricks for stone [Music] enoch had stone for stone enoch had the original enoch had revelation enoch had the predestinated word in a predestinated position amen because the architect had already designed it he had placed it he had put it on the earth these stones were meant to be in that spot amen and all you have to do is chisel them out of the cory and they'll fit right into where they belong [Applause] enoch had stoned for stone but nimrod made brick for stone so their revelation was based on man-made doctrines i don't know about you friends but i want stone for stone i don't want brick for my stone i don't want to build any kind of religion out of stone amendment bricks for stone i want the originals revelation the original revelation on the word that god placed there before the foundation of the world that he's carving out for a certain season for a certain time to fit in a certain place let us make brick and burn them thoroughly they had brick for stone slime had they for mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and the tower whose top may reach unto heaven let us make us a name they by their own mechanism wanted to reach god but god already had a mechanism for fellowship but they by their own mechanism by their own design by their own way wanted to get into the heavens by their own design and they wanted to make a name for themselves so that we're not scattered when enoch built that pyramid enoch was the tool in god's hand god built that pyramid god wrote that bible we have the written bible and the written bible was written by how many different authors how many different prophets pinned the pages how many different how many different ones pinned it out but who wrote the bible god wrote the bible who built the pyramid god built the pyramid but he used enoch enoch when he built the pyramid didn't chisel his name in the side of it there was nothing in that pyramid to bring glory or fame or honor to enoch it wasn't for enoch's name it wasn't for enoch's legacy it wasn't it wasn't for enoch's because what was enoch doing enoch was not enoch was not trying to make a name for himself or be a mighty one on the earth or a mighty hunter before the lord he was just humbly walking with the lord daily walking with or his interest was the lord his interest was the lord's work he was building a pyramid not to save himself not to make a name for himself and because the building of the pyramid didn't save him his faith in the word of god is what saved him but he built the pyramid because god told him to build the pyramid his building the pyramid was his love for god but his faith is what pleased god and so enoch was interested in pleasing god enoch was interested in walking with god enoch was not looking for his own protection his own salvation his own city his own name his own glory his own fame what he did he did for god what nimrod in this group did they did for themselves that's what i want to do today today i want to please god i want my faith in his word to please him i want everything i do to please him amen not build a name build fame amen have a legacy leave something behind where everybody remember you amen there's not a secret plaque amen in the in the corner of the of the pyramid that says enoch built this it wasn't for enoch and as we labor in the word of god amen as we labor revelation by revelation working in the vineyard of god amen let us do it for him not for us amen everything we do let's do it by his direction by his placing by his revelation not for our name not for our faith amen but just let our pleasure be just to walk with him because if not we'll find ourselves shortcutting the process and baking bricks so that we can go faster you know the revelation of god comes slow and steady i don't know how long it took enoch to build the pyramid he was on the earth before he's translated 365 years i don't know how long it took him but the revelation of god comes steady and i don't know that enoch i don't know i don't know that enoch could go one step further until he got more instructions from god but in the tower of babel they could go as fast as they wanted to go because they were doing it their own way sometimes we can get tempted in helping god along we want this thing to get on and we can become tempted to bake bricks to make our own revelation fit the picture so that we can take another step higher we got to get higher we got to go higher yeah we got to go higher i want to go higher but i just want to walk with him i just want to walk with the lord i want his pleasing with him and and i i'm just going to have an imagination if you allow me to have imagination i can imagine enoch walking with the lord and just that daily walk walking with the lord and they finally come by and there's a big stone over there and god says that's the next one that's the next one and he's not like praise god that's the next one and just takes it and puts it in place he wasn't the engineer he wasn't the architect you understand what i'm saying just be a sheepherder just walk with the lord don't bake bricks friends let us not bake any bricks and make our own tower and try to get another step closer to heaven to get higher in revelation god will take us there don't bake bricks brother bam says in the message the inside he said so adam to hold on to something made of fig leaf to cover his his wife's nakedness but he found out that that what he had in his hand did not work on down through the ages we could count men if we only had time let's take two or three of them anyhow let's take nimrod nimrod thought the same thing after the flood he was conscious that there was a god who would judge the wicked for they had just come out of the flood and he knew that it was sin that caused god to destroy the world therefore knowing that sin again would make god do the same thing he tried to achieve something to make a tower that men could run up in heaven if it got bad here on earth and live in heaven and then come back down on earth and sin and go back into heaven again friends that's the whole point of religion that's the roots that's the beginning that's the whole point cain never actually wanted to serve god because if cain actually wanted to serve god he would have done what god said when god said do is your brother cain wanted to worship but he didn't actually want to serve god do you understand i hope you can catch what i'm saying there's something in the heart of man that craves to worship that wants to worship amen that's why churches are so successful is because there's something in the heart of man that craves to worship amen cain wanted to worship but cain did not want to serve god and so nimrod wanted to worship but he didn't want to be obedient so the start of religion amen in cain was for self-gratification further on in the court he said now that's been the idea of men all along the road trying to sin and live in earth and be in heaven at the same time you cannot do it you can't do it you said you can't serve god and ma'am and that's the reason we believe tonight in a total abstaining from sin getting away from it it's poison do not fool around do not fool around it don't tolerate it at all have nothing at all to do with it don't don't see how close you can come to it without sinning see how far you can stay away from him anything that looks sinful stay away from it don't have anything to do with it at all so nimrod with his great mastermind he tried to achieve this and if you'll notice it's always been since man was created if you run the genealogy of cain's children they all become scientists mighty men workers in the earth with metal and wood and so forth they were smart intellectual side but says children were peasants sheepherders humble now that's the same way it is today those who are depending upon some man-made mechanical something that they can put their hands on and say this is it this is it something that man has achieved himself then you find out mostly that those kind who are trying to they're trying to escape the blood atonement back to the right way because the blood atonement amen is the blood was shed amen and the life left the blood and now it's the life that's the token for us and they're trying to avoid amen that token life now but nimrod after a while in the building of the tower god said it in the heavens and laughed at him and he come almost completing i want you to notice that he was almost achieved what he started to do but then all of a sudden god just turned the thing the other way and the thing went to pieces it went into dust just like adam's fig leaf apron went to dust so did nimrod's tower go to dust i tell your friends now at the end time he's going to just about complete the tower of babel he's just about to complete it god's going to turn it upside down again i want to read just a couple scriptures together if you turn to romans i want to read a couple scriptures in romans as we close see nimrod was building a program that didn't require faith in the word of god enoch didn't have a program enoch had a walk enoch did not have a religion enoch had a walk see we could be two people sitting in the same seat same few one can have religion and one can have a walk it doesn't matter where you go to church it matters what your motive is in your heart it's not about the right church the right ministry when we know those things are important we must be led by god to the right place where we belong under the right ministry of the word we know that but don't just think that if i land in the right spot it's automatically right with me no it's only right with you when it's right with you it's only right with you when it's right with you amen we want to have enoch's walk amen as we labor in the word revelation upon revelation we want to walk with god amen but nimrod wasn't interested in walking with god he was interested in building something that would satisfy his thirst for worship but allow him the liberty to do as he wished and we want to walk friends and enoch and his walk with god we found out in hebrews that he pleased god before his translation this was his testimony that he pleased god and the next verse says but without faith it's impossible to please god so what please god i would like to say it says it wasn't just the fact that he built the pyramid man because it wasn't the laying of the stone that pleased god it was the faith in his heart that moved him to lay the stone hope you understand what i'm saying it's not the religious acts it's not the obedience amen we can we can have a desire amen to to look good or be good or really a desire sometimes we have a desire to not be wrong do you understand what i'm saying sometimes we have a motivation to not be wrong and then that motivation to not be wrong we'll put forth some great efforts to do things that are right but sometimes that's not faith sometimes that's just fear but enoch wasn't motivated by fear enoch was motivated by faith he believed what god told him he did what god told him his action was a testimony of his faith and he pleased god but what pleased god his faith the tower of babel it was their lack of faith that caused destruction let's look at romans chapter 10 we'll just read a couple scriptures and we'll close romans chapter 10 verse 1 rather in my heart's desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth they read that again they were ignorant of god's righteousness they didn't understand or have no knowledge of god's righteousness and they went about to establish their own righteousness what was their own righteousness keeping the law but they were ignorant to god's righteousness because god's righteousness wasn't the obedience of keeping the law god's righteousness was faith three again let's read that again for they being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth romans chapter 1 verse 17. for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith that is written the just shall live by faith romans chapter 3 verse 21 but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference it's the faith of jesus christ it's the faith that enoch had it's the simplicity of walking with the lord and just believing him and being humble and not getting ahead of his program not building any man-made system to justify any of my actions but just humbly walking with the lord and pleasing him because i believe his word i believe all of his word and i just want i just want to be pleasing to him i don't want to please my neighbor and i don't want to please the other person i don't want to satisfy i don't want to satisfy a general conception and a thought in the people all around me i don't want to do something just because all the people at the church i just want to walk with god i want to walk with him i want to understand that pyramid i want to walk with the word i want to be the word i want i want to be ingrained and embodied everything i do amen is working with that word amen with the revelation of the word by the leadership of god amen i want it to be something that will will make it through the judgments not my own works and not my own ideas for my own motives and my own selfish reason but i just want to walk with god because in genesis there was two buildings but they had two different purposes one was god's building that god built for a memorial and for a testimony and it was the second bible that was written on earth it didn't do anything to reframe her glory to enoch and it wasn't for enoch's purpose and it wasn't to satisfy any craving in enoch it was for god that building was for god and it was built on the word it was built by the word it was the word word by word and that building survived the judgment of god because god does not judge his word but in genesis there was another building that was built but it was for a different purpose it was for the glory of mankind it was for the selfishness of man it was to satisfy a craving for religion and a craving to worship it became a deception that the devil used so that he would rob amen the worship that was intended for god because he was working with the lusts of man so it was one building that was built for the desire of god in one building that was built for the lust of man i say god help me to put all my efforts in your building not my building god help us to surrender ourselves humble ourselves and get rid of all selfish desire and all religion help us to walk with you and wait for you to tell us what to do let's all stand we find the tower of babel god comes down in genesis and he confounds their languages and separates them out and they go and it ends off the construction and brother branham says it turns to dust it falls into rubble it falls in the ruin but that was just the physical building because babel continued on it became babylon and then it moved all the way through and it became mystery babylon in the book of revelation so what we find in genesis we find in revelation chapter 17 and 18 the and the harlots showing that nothing changed man kept right on doing what man wanted to do and i'll tell you let's take it home a little tighter there's a war inside each one of us there's a war inside of each other was to build two buildings there's a part of us if we're the children of god with the seed of god there's something in us that wants to walk with lord and we want to build amen this building for god we want to build this memorial for the word of god amen but there's another part of us that's craving baked bricks to satisfy the flesh and that's why we crucify the flesh and the lust thereof and we stick to the lord we're not looking friends we're not looking for deception to come from the catholic church we're looking for the deception that'll come from that spirit that will sit on your shoulder to tempt you to bake a brick that'll tempt you to take your own understanding and and put it next to the word of god that's the temptation friends that's what we've got to be aware of that's what we're going to die out too brother brenham didn't say your enemy's the catholic church he said your enemy is the one you look at in the mirror when you wake up in the morning there's two buildings for two purposes amen we've got to be careful amen we've got to watch we've got to judge ourselves we've got to guard against the enemy amen we've got to stay on guard and walk with the lord and let all selfish lust go away it's my greatest desire that i could die more my greatest desire is to not go the way of nimrod and babel but to stay like enoch stayed and walk with god walk by revelation have faith that pleases my god faith in his word faith in the whole word i want to please him because i have faith in the word that slays me i have faith in the word that bruises me and i love it let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father god as we look and the book of genesis as your prophet told us to look that it's the seed it's the beginning lord god we can look and see that seed and see that beginning and lord we see today all those things have matured all those things have come to full

enoch was done with that pyramid it was the word and the word only and this bride is going to have the word and the word only no extra intellectual adornment no little extra flair from personal one or personal desire but when she's done it's going to be the word and the word only men i sing brother i give my mind make it all brand new change my life let me live in all the truth i just want to think
