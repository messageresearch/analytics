TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we see what they was doing to Joseph Joseph was in a bad situation semen but God was behind every bit of this even Joseph didn't understand what he was going through at that moment his brother rejected him just the same as the Jews rejected Christ if you notice what kind of spices they had when they came and picked Joseph up look what God did let's read it again it says here verse 25 they sat down to eat bread they lifted their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmaelites came from where Gilead that's called The Prophet preached the message there's a bomb in Gilead so I went about and looked up Gilead and Gilead is the place where the bomb comes from now look at the mind of God hit him they sitting there eating wondering what they gonna do God had all that pre-planned let them sit down and eat now you got these ishmaelites coming with bomb with spices and they seeing them coming God time every bit of that perfectly so they can pick Joseph up because Joseph remember Joseph him typing Christ and Christ is also the bomb of Gilead God was sending Joseph down there before they brother they didn't realize the thing that was going to save them they were sending it before them before they got there saw that person this is picking the economy of God actually was the true bomb that God used the ishmaelites to get him down there so that his Brethren the Jews later on Joseph will become their bum they needed Joseph so things that you go through in life God you can't see it at the time but God will preparing everything and when you get down to the bottom of the road he'll take you back say this is why I did this and I'll tell you out of all that I went through that's what I look back to now I know why God done away let what happened to me happened literally it brought me closer to God
