to musician God bless you uh greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be back right thank you for giving me a how can I say it a privilege position you know I can be part of two churches at the same time you know I I sneak in to in your retreat but how could you kick me out cuz I say I'm a member so how can you kick me out and keep the brother love you know you couldn't do that so but it has been a blessing to me because uh I got a lot from that Retreat amen uh particularly a lot from the uh Elders you know older people meeting that was wonderful with brother Eugene I took notes and uh and uh recently I've been uh talking about it as a study in our church in Pittsburgh it was such a blessing so I look look forward can I say I look forward for next week next next year yeah uh so uh it's uh it's wonderful to have you people to know you to be acquainted to you to fellowship with you it's just so wonderful all these faces that I know oh God God bless you thank you for your prayers and H without those prayers I don't know how I could function without your contined support and and somebody would send me sometime somebody send me a card and just encouragement cuz uh it is a uh but bam say we don't go to a picnic am we go to a battlefield uh so it's always good to know that you have people that love you that understand in a GLE this gleaning time that there is one here one there you know uh he need to be picked up yeah brought back to the uh the same um place um with the same Shepherd so it's good to be here I'm here with uh josy like Pastor say almost all my family is here uh you no Priscilla uh I think Rebecca and Joe are here and my little grandson that we call JJ very [Laughter] interesting uh um Jo and and Rebecca have been um help coming down there to Pittsburgh you know 2 hours um just trying to support us uh this time oh so what is new uh we moved to Pittsburgh last January it was not pretty moving during winter time very cold really cold with the snow it was such an adventure [Laughter] but God timed it because um we were hesitating about selling the house and renting it out or what and finally um it just happened that we all uh feel like we have to just sell it and we put it on the market a month later it was gone pretty much yeah I was sold so we are in Pittsburgh in cranberry uh just not far from the church like five minute I never had it for very long time has been this 2 hours coming here 2 hours going to Pittsburgh but this time we're very close to the church that I uh open the doors to the [Laughter] church um so it has been um wonderful of course you know um as the church is God uh as we grow uh we have also growing pains and that's how it works and so uh that's where we cover your prayers um uh but as I say it's a gleaning time and one person comes this one comes and and you find out that people that were not in church for 10 10 15 years now they can't wait to come to church you see a person sick but I'm coming to church my maybe my husband is sick but you are sick too but you came driving here so it's a it's what it's um it's hunger and thirst amen it's not about us yet we are carrier of that word but the people are looking for that word and the hunger and The Thirst is so big so it's amazing time we're living in uh we pray that God continue that blessing so by moving to um Pittsburgh we also uh have now a second service Thursday you are invited already come visit come encourage us and you don't have any excuse that okay uh Wednesday we have service and or Sunday you have a Thursday yeah so God has been good so that's all I can tell you right now um just thank you for continued support and your prayers so we are together here we are is a is One Vision is about him to be displayed in our lives so let us stand then um then change a little bit the service we're going to read Psalm 103 let's have a word to Pray Again heavenly father I just need you need you you're the most important come and use us as a tool to feed your children help me I commit myself to you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Psalm 103 Psalm of David uh bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who heal Health all thy disease may God bless the give his Blessing to the reading of the word you may take your seats that was very appropriate with uh the special we had this morning did you notice uh is the god that cares God that heals and what disease does he heal the body the spirit the soul and that's why we have uh this morning we're going to talk about it and God um let me just go to the title and say that it's a holistic approach of the message okay it is not holistic my holistic approach to the message but is a message holistic let's just Define it for holistic um uh you know when you have a holistic doctor that doctor will look at you as a whole he will not just look at your high blood pressure diabetics but it will be the whole thing the whole person uh then you will look at your social life um emotional uh situation and you will look at uh your diet and everything a man woman as a a whole amen and we want to preach the message as a whole preach everything is true we want to preach everything because as you preaching everything then it balances out all right but this morning I'm not talking about it I'm talking about the holistic uh approach of the message toward us all right because the message is a person amen right the person of Jesus Christ he approach us not just as a um a peace but as a whole you look at us as a human as a body spirit and soul and the target we know is our soul right but yet God look at us in a in a holistic way he cares about us he cares about our body cares cares about our spirit which is our emotional realm all right and he cares about the soul and the devil also when he attack our body he attack our emotional level realm he attack our spirit his goal is also to reach our soul so we can doubt yeah the pain we have the suffering all that the target the purpose is for you to reject check the word amen right so that the same way the Lord uh does is the same way that he does he it takes care of us sometime we don't pay much attention God cares about you know your physical um care he cares about what you do you know and um I would just give you an example here in believing God in 1952 he say brother say I've got a little girl 8 10 months old a little Sarah and she's sweet like darling I have not got to be with her very much and I have spoiled her I will admit that just hold her in my arms all the time you would too if you don't you didn't get to see that little Chomp of love no more than what I get uh to see here her you know just now and then when I'm home I guess I spoke her her a lot more whole lot she's cutting some teeth and got real sick she must have got the centy also it's going around I guess some of you uh families have a twoo real sick vomiting and dentry and and so she was crying her mother was so tired that she didn't even wake up I never either and I woke up and I will sleep sleep back in the second room from her and her mother and her in there and the little girl and I I was sleeping in the other room little Rebecca and so Billy po was staying with this grandmother that night I woke up I heard I say what made me wake up like that and but I'm is sleeping his wife is sleeping and the baby is sick and Bam suddenly w up why I heard his voice say go to your baby and give her a drink of water what the angel of the Lord working up the prophet to tell him go give water to your baby why don't you just heal her but because we are Body Spirit and soul and the baby just need water and God cares that the baby receive water at that time yeah praise God my I went in the room and she was crying she was crying all the time she uh she must not have uh uh woke her mother up the mother is sleeping in her little crib I went to got a glass of water as I went in the little thing pretty near drank the the whole glass of water the so the angel knew that the baby was dehydrated he cares oh why he should not he should just uh heal her no come on God follows the same law that he established the law of nature right so and the Lulu think pretty near drank the whole glass of water and there in her condition there with the dent she had had and just I thought isn't that lovely how sweet he is to do that that the second time of the third time so he really cares about us and uh we know in this age God actually demonstrated by uh sending to us a gift where it could just touch your your right arm with right hand with a left hand and uh see the disease you know whatever you are suffering God showing that I am the Lord who heals your body amen amen and he move to another realm he start Discerning our emotions you know uh spiritual Realms what's going on in you you know you start Discerning bypassing the seven senses and going straight to your spirit do you know that you are Spirit you know why brother bam say sometime that don't move around don't move around because you are Spirit I see Spirit and he can speak directly to the spirit and heal you because the healer is still God Amen yeah here is giving water I know a sister was sick all the time with trouble in her stomach and even was painful then one day maybe maybe she was praying one day she hear a voice telling her drink more water because she has been going to the doctors they didn't find what it was and drink more water she drun water she was healed praise God the god that heals all your disease is still here amen how about this brother Brenham say does um in the does what does thou hear he say you know Jesus said come aside Into the Wilderness and let rest a little while some of these guy that think you don't have to rest we find out they burn out pretty quick too if they don't take rest they find thems wrecked up somewhere I think this uh that's where our brother Billy gram is tonight trying to overshoot the mark these bodies are strong but they need rest then you can take a little rest and go somewhere and they will criticize you say hopefully BCF doesn't criticize brother Chad make help push him more often to go on vacation and rest absolutely this body needs to work body needs rest this is the word amen well did he speak to your soul no he spoke about your body but he knows that the consequences can go straight straight to the soul that's right if you don't rest you don't have time to relax so you can serve it can it can impact you amen yeah yeah and but say I thought it was a preacher look at him out yonder on the bank fishing or something so that's how people criticize Minister that rest say Oh I thought it was a preacher I said fishing brother got that problem when he was in h South Africa and they tell him don't keep talking about fish uh going to hunt that's that the Scandal you're causing a scandal here you are a minister how can you go hunt you always pray I'm telling you when people become so spiritual oh my my my my God say we are Body Spirit and soul yes but that doesn't matter uh Jehovah take care of it by say continue criticizing me but God will take care of his own so you see isn't a message so good to us the message that person called the message is the person of Christ is he cares thank you brother for that song this morning yeah he he just cares so much but sometime we don't pay attention God help us to to see that love and and even young people the devil is saying yeah telling them that you know you missing out my this is a this is a treasure this is wonderful oh my oh my it looks at your body it looks at your emotions what you are going through here there did not Jesus say shalom to people peace to you new day to you peace to you because the most important once you start you have a shelter you have food clothes that the problem usually is the emotional level that's where the devil will attack all of us what we call mind bottle and God addressed it in this age to show you that he cares about it absolutely here is a story you may know very well water from the rock a lady come no long ago saying that someone told her that she has Seven Devils another person told her she had she only had five and she wanted to know where the four went po woman plump gone nearly sat in the room taking off her stockings very strange you know and pull her feet up in the chair and say I haven't eaten for several days I'm not going to eat till I find out what uh become of these Devils say what are they um I say I don't know I never knew uh nothing about it say well well well one Minister told me I had seven devils and the other lady Minister say I only had five and now the two of them gone somewhere now see and come stay stay there about 2 hours in the house until God began to speak and say lady listen you come from St Louis she say yes how how do you know I say your husband's on the police force that's right I say you used to be a lovely housekeeper she say that's right I say recently your house looks like a hog pan say that's right I say your daughter over there your daughter's over there now taking care of uh your husband say that's right say who told you that I say keep talking because I was in a vision and I say you went down at a little place uh first you went to a doctor yes he gave you shots yes those S shots were called hormon yes I say you went down to a place and they told you you had Devils yes because you had a real funny feeling yes they sent you to California yeah and some man told you you had Seven Devils yes you went to a woman she said you had five Devils yes they told you you come to you come to me yes that's right say how did you know that I say the Holy Spirit say I I I say so I say you have got youve got you haven't got any Devils to begin with that's right she say I haven't I said no I said lady surely you know your mother went through the menopause it's the menopause something natural I say what do you think hormon shots are for she say I don't know I say for the change of life that's what it is no Devils at all it's just absolutely it is it's just your condition of life she began to relax my wife was cooking some bacon eggs out there she begin to look through the house I say kind of hungry she refused to eat first say yes yes she went out and ate three eggs and the bunch a big bunch of toast two cups of coffee and a lot of jelly and she was just happy as she could be she said brother bham are you going to pray for me and cast it out cast it away I said cast what a way she said the thing have you talk to people talking like that go the thing what thing oh yeah but B we say there's nothing to cast out she said I never felt so good in my life said what must I do I said go home straighten up your house cook your husband a nice big apple pie about that thick the the crust has to be that thick that's the beauty the beauty of the pie that cross has to be that siick and when he comes in tonight throw both arms around him and kiss him sit down and get on his lap and tell him you love him Live Like a Lady or two that's exactly that's all there is amen now brother bam is telling us I did not pour any oil but I can do that we do that I didn't pray I didn't scream I didn't do anything I just I see all the Ping of oil and The Stomping kinking and the loud hollering would not do a bit of good because he a is in a spiritual realm it is emotional a conversation with her was the solution amen right there was no prayer involved and sometime we don't know that's what happened maybe to you to me yeah this is what the prophet say that the truth that makes you free he tells the lady it's the truth when she got the truth she knew what was going on with her now she had a victory there's no prayer involved just to know it how many we need to know right so to you know and the word that was given to us came to us in a holistic way holistic approach to look at us the whole thing the whole package that we are ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free he say that's right isn't it beautiful amen amen a did you notice I put the few thing in uh blue here things that she should do well uh my daughter Rebecca one day uh show me that do you know um the five love language and there is a Baptist Minister who BR that some people mock it but what I realize is brother brandham talk about it did you see that amen they say the five love languages is a word of affirmation compliment quality time is not what she did give him a quality time clean up the house change the atmosphere is it know what she did in the quality time and she had a gift for him that's sick thck by I think all the brothers say that's it brother that's it and the fact that she she clean up she cook that a Act of service and then she sit in his lap is that true yeah yeah she sit in the lap put her arms around him kiss him and give him some word of airation Y you know what I mean I love you you're the best man you know in the world you always take care of us you know you always care you work hard for us and Men love it you know you want them they become like babies you know yeah you always do this for us you're so smart oh you help us you always take care of us and you see the man is like well I I try you know he's so happy and love comes naturally then amen cuz he has been fed literally and you know you know what I'm talking about yeah so God is so good to us church amen yeah you look at us in a holistic way um he loves us he he knows us and he cares yes a question let me just pull it I don't know what is under this question question and answer if you got a difference why either take it to the pastor and let him see that we think about it and so forth and then let it be uh submitted and don't take some Theory now it has to be brought in the word and a lot of time the pastor builds all those things up then when I come in is very humble brother Neville you know he is good he's just a little bit too humble we don't speak he he don't speak when he ought to speak so that that's that's right that's very strange you cannot be too humble you know but say you cannot be too sincere in the work of God how can you be too humble brother was talking some about something else he was Discerning what was in brother neille in his emotional real are you with me yeah and that was a hint in God Work y amen yeah so oh my let me just continue uh reading and pray I think it's not long ago we had a little talk ministers talk pretty tough the prophet say yeah but we can only read between lines here and get I say what's the matter brother Neville is this uh you are loving sort of brother and you don't want to to hurt no one's feeling you think uh standing in the Tabernacle here well after all it's brother Billy's Tabernacle it's good God no it's God Tabernacle it's not brother Billy brandham Tabernacle no it's God Tabernacle and you are the pastor see and he is the shepherd put in full charge yeah that's right so that uh uh and I I say well you say you don't want to hurt uh one's feelings well look if you side in with somebody siding this way another one siding this way you got to stand on Mutual ground and draw together here and say this is it see is that what the solution that's this is the decision I make don't say I am not this is not my Tabernacle this is Billy Billy uh Bram Tabernacle so this is what he's telling him yeah see that's why he could say you cannot be too humble brother because that humility is not right is not humility you you trying you try trying to avoid to take care of big situations you know the day a pastor cannot talk straight to you and tell you the truth that day I think it's time to pull why it has to be free to tell you exactly what the Lord tells him absolutely and sometimes when like a person like me I go to some place and God used the gift to help the people sometime I we say that I heard a minister Pastor telling me that I thought go uh God sent me I have a gift I go somewhere I help his people is yeah but to paraphrase him or to put it in my own words I say that's true but that's not the whole truth you go help people but you are also a child of God as a minister as a pastor you are all you also have needs amen absolutely and God is taking care of those needs God is molding you you know changing you molding you you need help and I learn it I learn it Pittsburgh has been good to me because God really you know I I had to take that journey and look in the glass I'm not talking about this face you know you know what I mean this face is gray out but I could stand here and and look at myself straight in the mirror and say this is your being a coward that's your nature right you are h a peacemaker you are this but this is not about you this is about my word that I'm sending to my people you cannot use the J Kadima and put it on my way amen absolutely you cannot do that this is bigger than you right and then now I now I have to when I want to make a decision do something I look is this jead again or it is the word what did that the truth makes you free if you take the truth if you don't take it then it's like anything else what is the truth what is the knowledge that you never apply right can you put it in your resume some will do to inflate the resume but you have to use that knowledge amen and say I not just know it but I used it amen yeah oh my the the toughest decision sometime we make in life is the best because spiritual thinks is when you look spiritual think is not when you're doing it is usually when you look back oh this is what I did yes it was the word you see the result was good amen amen amen right are we together amen sir I'm still a good friend all right all right right way I'm say this how can I overcome and say you look back and say I'm doing this and I'm doing that no no you you are defeated but there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus and walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize that that you are overcome you've overcome and you know that is a devil you can't say I got a sickness I don't believe it is a sickness don't say that recogn what you have yes it is a sickness it's my complexes it's my wounds my my scars that I'm bringing with me everywhere I go I have to recognize it who will make you accept that you have a free moral agency how who who will pull that out of you why are we afraid of looking taking that Journey amen You are not alone in that Journey You are not alone is with you right face it don't say I have no sickness oh you got it ah you got cancer you don't believe it is cancer doesn't matter it's a cancer it's a answer but remember greater is he that is in you that is in the world you must realize that the holy spirit that is in you has already overcome the thing that's the victory H he's in you and you can overcome by him that exactly sensible it's exactly the way the scripture is written overcoming oh my thank you that's exactly right another thing that the prophet said and the bridge they say that this is H the way in praying for the sick until you can find the cause I know the Cure but I've got to find the cause amen that's why the Visions are so needed and prominent to reveal the secret of the heart heart tells the person where you made your mistake and what you to do see no matter how much medicine you take and how much oil you put on their head and how loud anyone would scream over you if there is something wrong it will lay right there I say that's Satan that's right the Cure is always the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that The Cure who heals God heals how does he heal it doesn't matter he heals with all kind of things but it's still him healing amen but I need to know the cause because if I know the cause maybe I will know how to heal the healer is still God but the way he heals my body is not the same way he heals my spirit yeah the physical uh sickness not the same as emotional sickness but the same healer but if I know now I know now I know how to deal with it now I know to ask for prayers but I have to know the cause and God in this age has given us has has unveiled to us through his word everything in a holistic way and the word comes every day you hear the word it discerns sometime I preach message brother CH is preaching here or anybody you see the same them it's it's Discerning the this the problem is global is everywhere and God is Discerning and we we must receive the word there is no other solution we must receive the word the word has the power to change to mold to transform to make us a new creature amen that's what it is oh my I want to be a good boy that's that's just a me um sometime I yeah okay Lord amen Christ is revealed in his own word I was just uh talking to a young Minister and is wife in his room in in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world rest of the human beings on Earth I say remember Satan got a Punch coming at you don't care who you are God he's got a right for that one punch which had you rather be that punch be blind be a AR a IC sitting in a chair or be nervous so what punch so all of us we will always carry something right as long as we live in this body we will be carrying something that we can ask God over and over and over he may decide that he's not going to remove it how can you say that brother well look at what a prum amen ears and ears of nervous tension stomach ears ears and ears God tells him it's just 6 in long is a little a little try test it's going to go away well do you know when he went away just a couple months before he died yeah looks like he needed it but the point is to know it face it present it to the Lord let him say that my grace is sufficient let him say that if he doesn't say it continue praying about it but there are things that will be there and then if the devil is got right to that open uh to that open place now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time and to see this nervous age that we are living in so the Lord say that there will be always something flaws did not we hear the Masterpiece is a masterpiece because he has flaws I was I was watching with you I told you Wednesday I'm free so I'm here questions and answers brother Bram when someone gets on step on my toes this might be a good one step on my toes as the old the saying is my temper Rises how can I overcome this thing I know the Lord will have to do it but what can I I do in my heart that's a very good question in my heart that's what the problem is I I I have to be with the Lord I have to be in God's favor meaning God word I want to apply God word and what do I do in my heart I have that temper and he say sweeten your temper with prayer then make up your mind and then make a good decision make a decision that is contrary to the thing that is contrary to the word sweeten your temper you see the The Cure is the word The Cure is a person the person of Jesus Christ the way he hears a different way but he he hears like hear is telling him to sweeten his temper by prayer wake up in the morning start your day by reading the word and praying amen that's it that's the solution take it and go challenge the Lord and say you told me to do that yeah right amen amen yeah right I guess uh there's too many people in the building had any more temper than I did so brother bam can relate to it oh I had a mouth mashed all the time oh my goodness that boy has a very rough uh you know childhood yeah and I taken a lot of my meals out of a straw poor boy so he can relate to that God relate to all the things that we go through my case is unique no no I was reading to the church where brother bam say uh Tri are just L and temporary I'm I'm just I'm not quoting Faithfully but something like that you see our tests and tries are just small temporary mine you too yeah but it's just to build that material so we can get to that adoption so we can speak like him the purpose of this message this morning is that we will have to display him we will have to speak like the father amen and when people look at us they see that they see Christ manifested you know we talk like him that's why sometime he let those test and tral come and it's good for us I of course when I go through that I don't say this is good for me hope you know hopefully nobody understand that that way it's not like we say oh send those test to me no I'm scared to a point sometime you may wonder why this morning there was no TR fire and I I have to preach and there was nothing chances that the service will not be good yeah we are Body Spirit and soul God heals our body he heals our soul our spirit and soul Soul amen we contact the the nature with our Natural Body we contact it we have five senses of uh the spiritual realm and there is one that has no uh multiple senses it has no emotion has nothing like that that's the soul and God is always targeting that soul amen wow when this the body has senses the spirit has senses the soul has no emotion see it's amazing and God will speak to us straight without any interference it's the third pole it's not a public display is that right it's like entering in your closet and close in with him do you know that the angel could not get with the the patient in that boxy place do you know that even the angel who was sent to brother brandham did not get with the patient in that boxy place it was the the fill of fire alone with the individual in his closet a personal relationship with him am what a privileged people we are we are actually Mystic people we we are Mystic we're living in a world that people don't even have any clue living here but also living there this body Earthly bound and this other body that is over there Heaven Heavenly bounded all they fighting the theophan is calling you up when this one is pulling you down and when a God speak to us sometime he's he's not even speaking to the intellect is speaking straight to our soul because it's a soul will understand what the the emotional realm will not understand it's not Jesus say John 3 and no man had ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven what a mathematic well well this is really hard for the people that see everything in three dimension he saying no one went there except me who came from there me who right now I am over there how are you going to talk to that person are you going to talk to him up there or to him down here and what he did for Jesus is doing it for you and I we are here we are there we are Mystic being when God speak to us maybe speaking to your Toopy you are mystical let me just read it maybe it will look like I'm talking you know yeah we are mystical I'll get to that bad about PowerPoint presentation somebody should come up with a good idea all right uh you are in Heavenly places right now in Jesus Christ right now sitting there eating Mana from above drinking from The Rock right now but you are still here so who we are is is more than Body Spirit and soul we have multiple Dimensions that in one package and God takes care of all of the holistic approach amen you you are not just a believer who love the Lord receive the message but you are also part of a body can you imagine you are part of a local body and you cannot be a stand alone I I took a picture of a uh a laptop I young people still know what is a laptop right yeah wait one day the youngest will be telling you what is a laptop I I took a laptop it has no k cable at all no cable laptop I put the image there I say is it a standalone is not you still have power is still connected to the whole world on the internet but when you look at it it's like a standalone is not you are an individual but you are not alone you not stand alone like I come to church as soon as the service over I'm in my car we gone honey no you part of the body actually God raptures the body if you are part then you go but you are not to stand alone amen right do you agree with me yeah amen but you still have your your personal relationship with Christ as an individual yes while you also have a a relationship with Christ as a group how does God keep both he knows how to do it because it's a part part of the package okay let's go to the PowerPoint presentation images of Christ I'm going after tomorrow night after this wedding I'm going into the wildness I mean to stay there because way down in my soul I feel like I need a close walk with God that that that than what I am I don't want to just walk I try to walk right before him but I want a closer walk with him while the Bram Tabernacle is having a Revival I want one myself I just don't want it to happen in the building I want it to happen in me I want a closer walk I am an individual with my personal relationship with Christ but yet I'm part of the body God is taking to care of me as an individual but also not separate from the body right I want more of the holy spirit in me to reflect Christ in me I want to be like him I know that every true true Christian want to be like him that my heart desire to be like Jesus why I want to be my I want him to be his example of what I want to be only God can keep all his things together you know your own relationship you part of the church and you part of the Church of God is actually saying that we we are our brothers Keepers our sister Keepers that's strange yeah we we un train do you know the parable that say don't pick them up too soon because they an twin it's a body right then we take care of our own we we take care of issues we don't have always to involve the pastor to reconcile with someone the first person that sees a person doing something wrong is the one who speak to that person but yet we are scared to go reconcile with a brother who has done wrong because of our culture our culture can doesn't like to look somebody straight even politely with all love and tell them this is wrong this is wrong our culture pretend that there is nothing wrong and then we let things come in a church and destroy the atmosphere and God say I left that to you why did even God give us gift we don't focus on gifts but they are there for the church to cleanse the church is that right because God want you to be your brother's keeper absolutely the gift come there so you can see something and tell the person the day we will be that church something may happen where we can talk to my brother with love and care and the person is not offend Ed because we are afraid because the people are easily offended so you always see something wrong with in on me I was I was maybe new in the United States when uh I went to work I don't know what I had on my face I don't know what I had in my face and all these people are my friend you know nobody dares me you have something on your face church this is when I start getting a uh a mirror cuz nobody tells you it's terrible but the prophet tells us that we should not have a national spirit is over the devil you are a Christian if you see your brother sister has a problem you pray about it you feel led talk to them if they're angry why they are angry they're supposed to have the Holy Ghost they supposed to know is the love that direct you to them yeah now everything goes back to the pastor Pastor I saw the sister so and so a brother and so the pastor has to go and my that's not the way it works brother CH maybe I don't okay thank you because I'm stepping up in his ter territory now right but you know what I mean but I'm a pastor too by the way it would be wonderful when when I believed I was like in the 21 22 you will see before the Surface Two Brothers are outside the church talking we will look at them and smile they're fixing some issues we just say that yeah and that's how it should be am oh my we have a different dimensions and God is taking care of the whole thing thank God for that we don't know how spiritual things work uh but we are more than one dimension amen the prophet say that's the way it is to all believer they are Mystic they people don't understand because they live in the world to themselves Jesus Liv in the world a world that nobody else could touch the disciples could not understand him when he spoke to them they say they said they say why are you talking in riddles we don't understand this how can this bear see there wasn't in the world that he lived in yes see they could not understand him nobody could understand him and we are like that uh we even are not of this world because we are not of this world because we come from Heaven yeah our people may not understand it they cannot understand that's what the prophet say are we not like looking down on them and say I Come From Heaven you are nothing no this is the reality to encourage me encourage you yeah so that you can look for the things of above more than that are here amen question answer Genesis I think the people today that are possessed with this spirit this Spirit a part of the Angelic beings Spirits which rotate of of of God that never fell in in the beginning and resist the uh Devil's light in heaven amen you coming from heaven and you are going back to Heaven amen you are not of this world you are child of God and surrounded you are surrounded by children of God same father amen you go you have the same destination you are part of the same body it's nothing new really really yeah is you're part of the same body yeah and you your your life is entain with the the other the whole body has a function they all Supply something I I drew some uh mechanic wow drawing my church you know some sort of a what is it all kind of pipes going this that way and red blue and each one has has a function you know amen it has to do do do something not stand alone at all and I I I used to tell people that when we lay hands on a people there's nothing in our hands and it's just a uh obeying the Commandment of God I realized that maybe I was not right I realize that because this is what the prophet says and God's provide place of worship he say your hand dep on the people has got quickened power in them if you have been quickened have you come to life has Christ become real to you has the power of God been manifested are you in the church God provided church are you in it how how do you know you've been quickened in it your whole thoughts your whole being is in Christ now and the Christ is in the midst of the people Pro proving himself alive proving that he's here that the uh at the days of Sodom then the prophet is bringing another aspect we know that we are not in in a doctrine of laying hands and like like if we were the Jewish people but yet when you look at brother brand at the end of his life he more and more asking people to lay hands on each other that's right yeah well remember Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in all detail all aspect of it except the body that went to the grave but where is the body in you and I that's why you can say that laying hands on the people when you have a quick and power right amen this is different from just laying hand as a tradition this is I'm part of the body he is in the body I can just lay hands my my do you understand who we are we are Mystic being there is something in us and the devil want to Rob us from it and this morning we are saying no by the word of God that the authority that the word of God give us we are saying no and God cares about us the body the spirit and the soul today we can get Victory because he's here he's in his body oh praise God amen amen oh oh my same thing same thing you are H you are husband you have your personal relationship with Christ but you also have relationship as a unit husband and wife have you noticed that how God keep up with all that body spirit and soul believer member of the body husband wife living here living there the theop any over there the body here you also God look at you say individual but he looks also at you he sees not one it is two amen it's real yeah it really see you as a one husband and wife as not two but unit it's amazing but he does that I don't know how he does it sometime we try to explain spiritual matters but again I'm saying we are not talking to your intellect your soul will capture what we are talking about amen marriage of the Lamb did you ever read in the scripture how that the first man God made was a jeel person I had a whole message preaching about Je jeel duality in God word you know the first man God made was a jewel person Adam was both Adam and Eve spiritually speaking but when he made the first man in his own image and God is a spirit but when he put them in the flesh he separate them he he he taken the masculine Spirit but put it in the man and taken the feminine spirit and put it into the woman amen therefore you are dual yeah you know two things two Concept in one only God can do that and he say I did it no man should put us under and then when he look at you in your marriage he look at you as a unit you have your personal relationship your wife has your husband has but you have individual relationship but you have a relationship as two a one entity and God sees it as real as you and I are God sees the the two of you as a unit that's right therefore When you pray let me just go ahead and say when you pray there are prayers that you make to God between you and God but but there are prayers that God sees you as a unit where is your wife Adam where is your wife oh yeah yeah yeah my husband is more spiritual than we're covered in our house no no it doesn't work that way that's right oh you know my wife is very spiritual person God will hear I like to send her to church so she can be submissive to me I always use some sarcasm but I should not is I I'm a picture person that's what this thinks that look like sarcasm because I picture it and you see it you see how bad it is just the way I say it you see how bad it is then you understand is wrong amen no God uh God doesn't do that uh how are we doing about time Malachi Malachi 2 oh we always read Malachi 4A yeah go back to Malachi 4 because that's what we read here no we're going to read Malachi 2 because I say so okay okay and this has yet done again cover the altar of the Lord with tears with weeping and with crying out in so much that he regardeth not the offering anymore and receive it with Good Will at your hand huh you have come to the god altar with tears weeping crying but God doesn't look at it yet he say wherefore because the Lord had been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou Hast dealt treasurly yet she thy company and the wife of thy Covenant I will not listen to your prayers because you mistreat your wife but remember the Old Testament did not just talk about women it did not talk about women he talks about men all right therefore what he's talking about here is the marriage am mistreating not being at your position in the marriage amen right man leading his family with the word and with love amen the wife is the mother is the pastor of the children she's submissive to the father to the husband therefore when they come with weeping and crying God hears their prayers because they are one unit that's how God sees them he cannot even separate them in that regard that's right amen you know some people say to Jesus this is not fair I I have my Christian Life wife my wife is doing something else my husband is doing something the Lord doesn't say that look look they asking him about putting away the wives and and you see they asking him about putting away he say they say in Matthew 19 they say uh unto him why did Moses then command to give a written of divorcement and to put her away he say unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart heart suffer you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so amen and I say unto you whosoever will put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall uh marry another commit adultery whosoever married he which is put that away that commit adultery and they will ask him I don't see it here in the PowerPoint they will ask him if that is the condition of a man toward his wife then it's not worthy and Jesus said to them it's not given to everyone to understand this it's a mystery that there will be people that need to understand understand the mystery of marriage and divorce because he not starting here on Earth he starting up there it's God having his family and he want us to replicate the same thing that he had in heaven Peter says likewise he husband dealt with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the Wecker vessel and as being ears together of the grace of life that your prayers be not injured so so you have to be together in harmony everyone respecting what the word say about them yeah right then when you pray God listen to your prayer looks like some prayer are individual prayers some prayers are common as a unit and God will hear those prayers if you are in one unit amen yeah right this is not me I'm not being legalistic it's just the way it's just the way God made things to to be sure that you stay at the position and you reflect him on Earth that's all that's all a little spanking here and there to keep you into the grow growing into the adoption that's what he's doing he say I will not listen to your prayers but but God listen to our prayers he could listen more more he could answer more you see brother Bram taught us something that to be sensitive to the Holy Ghost brother Bram will know that God is not with me even though I'm going and lay hands on people miracles happen he still know God is not in me I feel empty true so he could give us more more of relationship with him it could give us more as a couple we cannot be separated is a unit yet I yet as a husband I have my personal relationship with Christ wife you should have a relationship with Christ but yet again he can change a little bit his glasses and see us as a unit yeah amen right why it's always a cleaning God cleanses his people he cleanses the church through gifts he cleanses the churches through the word when he comes you hear the word you tell your brother you reconcile with your brother constant cleansing cleansing cleansing because we have to display him we have to reflect him we have to act like him we have to have these things multiplying more and more Among Us I have not done enough I I remember living my house I had my neighbor coming to me and one of them was crying we're crying I never done anything actually I never done anything good I never shovel there s one one come to me and say you've been such a nice neighbor truly you've been and they have been good to me actually my job require I have some uh clearance okay don't tease me about it but clearance for my job security and things like that and my neighbors they the government will go to my neighbors talk to them is it a good guy yeah good recommendation what did I do to them I should do something but I did not it's not me it's the grace of God in Me but it will be great if also I can display really Christ to them because that's what we are doing here otherwise our body will be changed already right we are still here so someone can be influenced positively with our life therefore God is looking at us in a holistic way yeah your body how you take care of it your your your spirit your emotions those things those complexes if they make who you are that's what it is and God say I don't like what I see you can do better than that and I have provided for the solution I'm here to help you you are not alone amen right therefore when all these things are gone I mean they will not go all but we will know we will keep them under the blood amen and then we will display Christ more and more and more do you believe that yes sir yes that's what I had this morning for you God bless you musician if you can come our goal is to reflect him the more I reflect him the better doctors I found that doctors that do holistic care they really oh they have some Ambitions they they say they they say your physical body they say you're emotional they even say that your spiritual care how do they know about to give you a spiritual care but they know that the human being needs that you know and then God has sent his message that look at that the whole thing the whole package thank you heavenly father that's a wonderful let all stand it's so good to us amen it's amazing is is just amazing don't you want to reflect to him yeah but the devil is standing on our way that's why God has just discern him this morning and remember it will Contin doing that as you come to church is Discerning it but what is the knowledge that you cannot use apply the word submit yourself to the word it will bring the solution to all that amen it's changing me I I go there now I know this is joh you want to do the Johan thing yeah me and my son we H we we we have a language yeah internal jokes you know we say you want to do the Enoch you know we know what that means it's me the package you know yeah you should say you want to do the daddy Papa the JEA and then we know this a it's a battle constant battle but yet we have the solution when we ignore who we how we think how we view things how we always act I even call myself on on the puppet that I'm a coward as a nature then I have to be careful oh the coward is coming or is the word of God Amen exactly but you have to face it how can you call yourself some names if you can't you can because it's self-preservation what was brother nille doing I'm not criticizing my brother but he was a self-preservation I don't want people to start talking about me NE did this n did that therefore I will just leave it to Bill when Bill comes he will take care of it no you are the pastor that's your post of Duty there are time to speak nice and time to be tough with love that is useful

God for that and I also realize there's so many things we're still learning and growing and and I appreciate brother Jean just coming and being honest and just opening his heart because for me I'm still growing I'm still learning even learning how to be a pastor and and I'm sorry that you guys have had to endure the learning process and but I I I started the year off by quoting where brother BM said and and he said this year I want to be a better pastor and that was my prayer and this coming year I want to be a better Pastor a better brother a better husband a better father and God is certainly be giving us the word to help us with the desire of our heart and I want that too I I don't want my complexes or my personality or my my slow methodical snail Pace to hinder the church or hurt and I know that sometimes it does but but you know I thank God for his Mercy thank God for his love and may God help us to get out of our own way sometimes as fathers and husbands and mothers and wives and brothers and sisters and get out of our own way and let the word take dominion over us and help us to grow and love one another and and I love you all and I thank God for his word he keeps coming with the same theme and he keeps building us and helping us I think God wants to live in flesh I think God wants to demonstrate the word I think God wants to live in you and I and I think he wants the word on display and I think he's coming and he's rubbing and knocking and moving all the things that are hindering that out of our lives so that he can come and display himself and I believe it's the hour for and I thank God that he's doing this work I just want to yield to it I just want to surrender I just want to take my portion and say God I recognize that's true and I need you to

it's sad to see you go brother but we're looking forward to another time amen God bless you let's just bow our heads and give a prayer of Thanksgiving Lord Jesus you are so mindful of our every need God as you spoke to us today you showed us how through the ministry of a prophet you spoke to every need we have in our life our emotional needs our physical needs those things that that that are barriers sometimes in our lives barriers to our prayer with our relationship with our spouse Lord you've come and and and you you've come and you've come down on a real level to where we really live to show us that you've given us of yourself to meet every need you've given us the way you've demonstrated it you've preached it God you're so good you're so mindful you know we are but flesh you know we are hindered and handicapped by things in life and by our own complexes and by living in flesh and by our emotional Realms you're so aware of it you're more aware of it than we are and you've made a provision Lord you've come and you've allowed us to have a Ministry in this time lord through your messenger that would just bring your mind down from the back part of your mind bringing out the mouth of a man so that you could tell us that you understand it you know it you can care for it all and you can Deliver Us from every bit of it God I pray that you continue to pour your oil in Lord the balm of Gilead that would heal us physically Lord there's those here today that need their body touched so that they can keep serving your purpose they need to be free from Pain and and delivered Lord so that they can continue to do what you've called them to do I pray that You' heal them according to the promise in your word there are those of us here this morning that have been wounded emotionally and have have things we're dealing with and we need that to be healed so that we can move forward in your program and we can serve you Lord God I pray that you would heal those wounds I
