[16:30] he's uh I guess if you if you've been in
[16:34] a a family where there's a a minister
[16:36] there's kind of like a bit of nerves
[16:38] going around and the attacks that come
[16:40] and go and it's it's not an easy life um
[16:45] so I just feel for brother CH he was
[16:46] saying before I left I think it's eight
[16:48] services in nine days that he's really
[16:51] going to be under pressure so we really
[16:52] just send my prayers especially for
[16:55] myself and you are sending yours I would
[16:57] just think of him at this time it's
[16:59] remembering those those ones and I think

[17:05] mercies for those and those ones that

[17:10] can we say I'm a bit nervous I'm just
[17:12] calming
[17:14] down uh I've just got a simple word
[17:18] today but the the good thing about not
[17:20] being a preacher is that there's no
[17:23] comebacks so I'm just uh I'm just I I
[17:26] don't know why that that song touched me
[17:28] sister is it Rebecca yeah um because the
[17:32] seasons come and go and you know the
[17:35] gray hairs on the side of my head came I
[17:37] never thought I'd see him but I'm just
[17:40] thankful I don't look the prettiest
[17:43] never really did but um to the Lord
[17:46] we're the most beautiful thing we are
[17:49] trophies of his love and his grace and

[18:26] thankful for you guys you know when the
[18:29] Lord changes you you become a different
[18:31] person and you no longer hang with the
[18:32] guys that you used to or the people you
[18:34] used to and yeah I'm thankful that I'm
[18:37] amongst people that the Lord's changed
[18:39] also so we appreciate each other it's
[18:41] not just the one way straight so it's a
[18:44] little bit of a I won't say a lengthy
[18:46] reading but we're going to read from 1
[18:48] to 17 so John chapter 1 1 to1 17 if we
[18:53] could it says and after these things
[18:55] Jesus showed himself again to the
[18:57] disciples at the Sea of tiaras and on
[18:59] this wise he showed himself so for the
[19:02] kids on when it says on this Wise It's
[19:04] like in this manner he showed himself
[19:06] verse two there was together Simon Peter
[19:08] Thomas called dius Nathaniel of can in
[19:10] Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two
[19:11] other of his disciples Simon Peter saith
[19:14] unto them I go fishing they say unto him
[19:17] we also go with thee then uh they went
[19:21] they went forth and entered into a shape
[19:23] immediately and that night they caught
[19:26] nothing but when the morning was now
[19:28] come Jesus stood on the shore but his
[19:30] disciples knew not that it was Jesus
[19:32] then Jesus said unto them children have
[19:34] you any meat and they answered him no
[19:37] and he saith unto them cast the net on
[19:39] the right hand right side of the ship
[19:42] and ye shall find and they cast
[19:44] therefore and now they were not able to
[19:46] draw it for the multitude of fishes
[19:48] therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved
[19:51] saith unto John it is the Lord now when
[19:53] Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord
[19:55] he G his fish's coat upon Him unto him
[19:57] for he was naked and he cast himself
[19:59] into the sea and the other disciples
[20:02] came in a little ship for they were not
[20:04] far from the land as it were 200 cubits
[20:06] so for the kids again a cubit is from
[20:08] there to there is so it's about 200 ft
[20:12] you can ask your dad later on how far
[20:13] that is dragon in N with fishes verse n
[20:17] and as soon as they were come to land
[20:19] they saw fires of coal there a fire of
[20:21] coals there and fish laid there on and
[20:23] bread Jesus said unto them bring of the
[20:26] fish which ye have now caught Samu Peter
[20:29] went up and Drew the net to to land full
[20:32] of great fishes 115 and3 and for all
[20:36] they were so many yet was the not the
[20:38] net broken Jesus saith unto them come
[20:41] and dine now none of his disciples
[20:43] thirst ask him who art thou knowing it
[20:45] was the Lord Jesus then cometh and
[20:47] taking bread giveth them and fish
[20:49] likewise this is now the third time that
[20:51] Jesus showed himself to his disciples
[20:53] after that he was risen from the dead so
[20:55] when they had died Jesus saith to Simon
[20:58] Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me
[21:00] more than these he saith unto him yay
[21:02] Lord thou knowest I love thee he said
[21:04] unto him feed my Lambs he sayith unto
[21:06] again second time Simon son of Jonas
[21:08] lovest thou me he saith unto him y Lord
[21:10] thou knowest I love thee he saith unto
[21:12] him feed my sheep he saith unto you the
[21:15] third time Simon son of Jonas lovest
[21:17] thou me pet was grieved because he had
[21:19] said unto him the third time lovest thou
[21:21] me and he saith unto him Lord thou
[21:23] knowest all things thou knowest that I
[21:25] love thee Jesus saith unto him feed my
[21:27] sheep
[21:29] let's just pray over the reading of the
[21:30] word Lord Jesus we just come before you
[21:33] Lord just ask Lord that you bring
[21:34] something through the scriptures that
[21:36] you just encourage us Lord we love you
[21:38] Lord we just bless your name we say
[21:39] thank you Lord for all the things you do
[21:40] for us we love you Lord Jesus in your
[21:43] name we just come before you asking for
[21:44] your help
[21:45] amen amen you may be
[21:49] seated
[21:52] so sorry I think Blake would have just
[21:54] gently flipped the uh I I'll try
[21:57] actually
[22:04] you're never too old to learn sister
[22:07] Joyce as she as she picks up a
[22:11] tissue so this morning I just want to
[22:13] try and relax a little bit this morning
[22:14] it's more of like a I would say a kind
[22:16] of a Sunday school see the nice thing
[22:18] about the word of the Lord is that we
[22:19] can see something in the word of the
[22:20] Lord and we can use it as a type and a
[22:22] shadow and see just see the word see the
[22:25] word and that that's what kind of
[22:27] excites me is if you see something new
[22:29] so as I read the scripture a while
[22:32] ago um the thought came to me and uh I
[22:35] haven't spoken on it so I'm doing a Ben
[22:39] sorry but that's the good thing about
[22:41] not being a
[22:42] preacher I'm just sharing my thoughts
[22:44] with you sharing what blessed my
[22:45] heart um and the title for the sermon
[22:49] I'd like to say uh call it fishing on
[22:51] the right side fishing on the right side
[22:56] and um i' just like to begin with a with
[22:57] a quote from from
[23:00] um brother Ram he says and Jesus came
[23:02] it's
[23:04] 1957 way after the resurrection a
[23:06] disheartened little bunch of disciples
[23:08] had gathered together in different
[23:09] places at different places Jesus said
[23:11] well I'm just going to go fishing I'm so
[23:13] discouraged how could it be that the one
[23:15] that I seen called Lazarus from the
[23:17] grave how could it
[23:19] be um be when I stood there and seen the
[23:22] woman of name and her only son dead and
[23:24] he laid his hand on the boy and said
[23:27] young man arise I saw him come to life
[23:29] eyewitnesses seen Lazarus after being
[23:32] dead for 4 days his old grave clothes
[23:34] wrapped over his face and over his body
[23:35] he came forth from the grave I've seen
[23:37] him turn water to wine I've seen him
[23:39] touch the leper that was as white as
[23:41] snow and the Very blush of Health was in
[23:43] his cheeks in a few minutes how could it
[23:45] be that he could hang on a cross with
[23:47] the mockery Soldier spit on his face how
[23:49] could it be that he could lay his hands
[23:51] down and could drive Nails in his hand
[23:53] how could it be that he'd permit a crown
[23:54] of thorns to be pull down over his face
[23:56] and cross his feet and let them Drive
[23:58] spikes into his feet how could he stand
[24:01] there rolling a cat of Ninetails and
[24:03] split his back and ribs and was shining
[24:05] through how could he let them treat him
[24:07] like that how could he hang there
[24:09] between the heavens and the Earth and
[24:10] blood running from him and let those
[24:12] mockery priests his arch enemies walk by
[24:14] and Sass him how could he let a Roman
[24:16] soldier put a band around his head and
[24:18] hit him and say now who prophesies and
[24:21] who can tell forth tell us who hit you
[24:23] we'll believe you how could it be how
[24:25] could it be that he could let the high
[24:27] priest walk out there and say say come
[24:29] down off the cross if thou be Christ we
[24:30] will believe you how could it be that a
[24:32] great person like that who we believe to
[24:34] be the Son of God could ever go through
[24:37] such torment and Punishment as that and
[24:39] sit silent oh it was a dark hour the
[24:41] very Darkest Hour they hadd ever seen
[24:44] seeing them pull the nails out and see
[24:46] him bow his head and die and they take
[24:47] his body put it in Joseph Aria's grave
[24:50] how could it be when he seen the big
[24:52] rock laid up there and the the Roman
[24:53] seal put upon it how could it be he was
[24:55] so discouraged he said I just believe
[24:59] I'll go
[25:00] fishing and the disciples said well I'll
[25:02] go with you all night long
[25:05] discouragement they had pulled and
[25:06] caught nothing Jesus was gone it seemed
[25:09] like everything was gone they couldn't
[25:11] even as much as catch a fish right in
[25:13] the darkest of ours someone stood on the
[25:15] bank and said children have you any meat
[25:18] amen you
[25:20] know God I we like fishing but I've also
[25:24] been plenty of times when you catch
[25:26] nothing and you get discouraged
[25:29] you
[25:30] know our thought this morning is fishing
[25:32] on the right hand and I'm just praying
[25:34] that the Lord's just going to reveal a
[25:35] little bit of his word to us just
[25:37] encourage us because we need Revelation
[25:39] there's a song I think you guys sing
[25:40] give me more Revelation and that's what
[25:43] we need it's what keeps us going we need
[25:45] more
[25:47] Revelation you
[25:49] know if we can just turn the diamond of
[25:52] the word a little bit I like saying that
[25:53] expression I can actually start this
[25:55] makes me a bit more calm down I've got
[25:58] this drawn in in our little church there
[26:00] and it's basically supposed to be a
[26:02] diamond but the diamond there they got
[26:04] six little pieces to it but if you would
[26:05] turn the diamond it would kind of look
[26:06] similar all the way
[26:08] around and so we you know if if if you
[26:10] look at one side of the diamond here you
[26:12] can describe this piece but then when
[26:13] you're standing down the bottom here you
[26:14] can describe this piece and whoever's
[26:16] kind of looking up at this look you know
[26:18] you see it from this angle and then
[26:19] somebody up here and they're seeing it
[26:20] down from that angle and I'm not into
[26:22] somebody saying oh well you know the
[26:23] message means this because we're looking
[26:24] at it this way it's always got to match
[26:26] up with the word it's always got to be
[26:27] the word but we can see um a picture
[26:31] that helps us to see the word clearly
[26:33] and this is what I'd like to do today so
[26:36] now in verse three of this John chapter
[26:39] 21 we can read pardon me we see that
[26:42] John says I go
[26:44] fishing and if you remember Simon Peter
[26:47] he was actually a fisherman that was his
[26:50] that was his job and um we' like I'd
[26:53] like to just turn to that and just read
[26:54] that one as well it's quite important
[26:55] scripture turn to Mark Matthew 4 EXC
[26:58] excuse me you can hold your hand in
[27:00] there hold your hand in John
[27:02] 21 hold your hand in there and turn to
[27:04] Matthew chapter
[27:06] 4 and we're going to read 18 to
[27:11] 20 verses 18 to
[27:16] 20 it says and Jesus walking by the Sea
[27:19] of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called
[27:22] Peter and Andrew's brother casting a net
[27:25] into the sea for they were
[27:27] fishes and he said unto them follow me
[27:29] and I will make you fishes of men and
[27:32] they straight away left their Nets and
[27:33] followed
[27:34] him so we can see that they were
[27:36] fishermen we've got two things here that
[27:38] we can see we see that
[27:42] Simon Peter and Andrew Philip both they
[27:44] were
[27:45] fishermen
[27:47] okay of the natural the natural fish but
[27:51] now we see that the Lord
[27:53] here is pointing to a time when they
[27:57] will become fishes of men so if we
[28:00] notice the Lord Jesus says I will make
[28:03] you fishes of men follow me and I will
[28:05] make you fishes men so he's pointing to
[28:08] the Future because the Lord when he
[28:10] called Simon Peter and Andrew Phillip
[28:13] it's a time when the Lord had actually
[28:15] come to Israel we know the scripture
[28:18] it's John
[28:19] 1:11 um he came to his own in his own
[28:22] received him not so at this point in
[28:24] time um he came to his own so he's
[28:27] saying I will make you fishes of men
[28:29] pointing to a time in the future when
[28:32] they were not fishes of men natural now
[28:34] but they were going to be fishes of
[28:37] men so now we're back to John 21 by the
[28:42] way so when Simon Peter in verse three
[28:45] says I'm going to go fishing for him
[28:47] it's kind of normal that's his it is
[28:50] it's what he knows and sure he was
[28:53] supposed to go
[28:55] fishing you see but his own see the his
[28:59] own had rejected him as in the Lord
[29:02] Jesus his own they rejected him now so
[29:05] Simon Peter was supposed to be going
[29:07] fishing but not the fishing that he
[29:09] thought you reading between the lines
[29:12] you see the Lord's already right at the
[29:14] very beginning the very first time he
[29:16] lays eyes on Simon Peter he says give
[29:18] pack it in follow me and I'm going to
[29:20] make you fishes of
[29:22] men but so he was pointing for but they
[29:24] kind of missed it at that point in time
[29:26] and like us too many times get
[29:28] discouraged and they kind of fall back
[29:30] on the thing that they always used to
[29:33] do so now with his own strength with
[29:38] Simon Peter's own carnal strength he
[29:40] goes back to what he always does and he
[29:43] catches
[29:44] nothing and that's the quote we read
[29:46] There were how discouraged they were how
[29:49] discouraged they were and don't forget
[29:51] Simon Peter he's also denied the Lord
[29:54] he's denied the lord I can't even be a
[29:56] good Christian I can't I can't I'm so
[29:58] useless how many times do you know many
[30:01] times um many times we're all human
[30:03] beings we're trapped in this body and
[30:04] many many times we we we begin to feel
[30:08] like we're worthless you know and it
[30:10] doesn't matter who you are it doesn't
[30:12] matter if it's standing behind this
[30:14] Pulpit or song leading whatever it is
[30:16] you maybe walk down you've been song
[30:18] leading you think oh Lord I just what a
[30:21] mess I I I didn't say what I wanted to
[30:23] say I didn't I couldn't bring it and but
[30:25] it's CU we're in this flesh and we
[30:26] become down it's not he looks at us is
[30:28] how it's how we look at ourselves so now
[30:31] he's gone back and he's he catches
[30:34] nothing you
[30:35] know sometimes it's like that song the
[30:38] sister sang um about the seasons
[30:42] sometimes the Lord's got a season for us
[30:43] to go this way and He blesses our path
[30:47] and then suddenly the Lord turns us
[30:48] around and he's got something else for
[30:50] us and the Very fact that he's leading
[30:53] us to a different path means that he can
[30:56] no longer bless us going in this way
[30:59] and because his hand of blessing kind of
[31:02] comes off Us in carnal things in the
[31:04] things that we think meanwhile he's
[31:06] blessing this path here but because
[31:09] we're kind of a bit like donkeys we just
[31:11] want to keep going on we become
[31:13] discouraged meanwhile if we just turn
[31:16] our heads the Lord's got a door open for
[31:17] us on this side but oh no no I'm going
[31:19] to keep going and and you know brother
[31:22] Chad preached on religious reasons for
[31:23] things that was the first Wednesday we
[31:24] were here I think you know all the
[31:26] religious reasons that you make in fact
[31:28] was it last time I can't remember last
[31:29] time we what we make religious
[31:32] reasons so it's kind of like the I'm
[31:35] plowing ah head going this way and the
[31:38] Lord's showing me I'm going to go this
[31:40] way but not not the Lord showed me to go
[31:43] this way like 10 years ago now the
[31:45] plan's changed but no no I'm going to go
[31:47] this way and we keep plowing ahead and
[31:48] the way gets narrower and
[31:50] narrower and here the Lord's basically
[31:53] showing us to go this way but because
[31:56] we're plowing ahead this and then the
[31:58] road gets narrower life gets
[32:00] harder and then we remember all the
[32:03] quotes and the scriptures life's harder
[32:05] for Christian oh that's it I've got to
[32:07] be in the will of the Lord and you
[32:08] plowing ahead and then things get more
[32:10] difficult and it's like oh well you know
[32:13] Lord you know the way is narrow of
[32:15] scripture I yes I've course the narrow
[32:17] way and we just and meanwhile the Lord's
[32:20] just saying hey guys turn right see what
[32:23] I mean so now this is Simon Peter he's
[32:24] actually showed him right at the
[32:26] beginning that he's going to be fici of
[32:28] men now the Lord is actually wanting him
[32:31] now because now at this point in time um
[32:33] I would move it across maybe um I can do
[32:35] my little famous timeline so this would
[32:38] be time across here time across here and
[32:41] we're going that way and don't worry
[32:42] I've spelled it wrong but I can't UND do
[32:44] that and so here we have the cross here
[32:46] is time time is all the years and then
[32:49] here we've got uh the
[32:51] cross okay so now this on this side this
[32:55] side of the Cross okay the Lord Jesus
[32:58] calls Simon
[33:00] Peter now we're on this side of the
[33:04] Cross so now is the time that he's
[33:07] supposed to be the fishes of
[33:09] men plowing on down you know oh we're
[33:13] without
[33:14] fishing there's
[33:16] no it's it's it's a narrow way it's a
[33:19] narrow way it's it's got to be hard the
[33:20] way of a Christian's hard it's getting
[33:22] meanwhile the Lord's got something else
[33:23] for
[33:25] him
[33:26] sometimes we go back to something we
[33:30] fall back on something that we think we
[33:33] know how to do it some so Simon Peter
[33:37] now he feels discouraged to the one
[33:39] thing that he ever could do in life was
[33:40] the fish and he thought he knew how to
[33:43] do it so now he goes back to
[33:47] that sometimes we find our way in
[33:50] ourselves in that
[33:51] way sometimes we just stay in the
[33:54] comfort zone as brother Shay were
[33:55] talking the other day you know it's like
[33:57] sometimes we feel like we're going to
[33:58] stay in his comfort zone and the
[34:00] meanwhile the Lord's got something else
[34:03] let's read verse four and 5 if we could
[34:04] we're going to look at this scripture
[34:06] verse four and 5 it says but when the
[34:09] morning was now come Jesus stood on the
[34:11] shore but the disciples knew not he was
[34:14] Jesus then Jesus saith unto them
[34:16] children have ye any
[34:18] meat you know it's really interesting he
[34:22] calls them
[34:24] children and I just want to look at this
[34:27] word
[34:28] children at this look at this word
[34:31] children if we can so this this word
[34:34] children we just move that to one side
[34:36] so the word here children
[34:38] CH children it's a Greek
[34:41] word and it means uh
[34:45] P
[34:47] pon pon okay that's that's what that's
[34:50] the Greek word so it means it means a
[34:52] child ling a child which is a child Ling
[34:56] here it's written childing it means half
[35:00] grown boy or girl so I'll just write
[35:02] half
[35:04] grown
[35:06] boy
[35:08] slir okay it means an immature
[35:13] Christian which I really like that
[35:16] IM
[35:19] mature sister Marin is in prayer right
[35:21] now
[35:23] Chris she's
[35:26] uh brother
[35:29] Gabe there's brother Gabe
[35:31] here he's preaching well yeah he um he
[35:36] doesn't capitalize the devil as
[35:42] well I that's me right it means a child
[35:44] and a damsel child and a damsel damsel
[35:48] okay and this is the word that we're
[35:49] just looking at here this this Christian
[35:51] immature
[35:53] Christian so the Lord uses the word it's
[35:56] very interesting he calls the
[35:59] disciples as he calls them in a manner
[36:02] using this specific word which means
[36:04] also an immature
[36:07] Christian so they're just starting out
[36:09] on the young in the word the the young
[36:11] they don't I mean they they don't
[36:13] they've gone fishing you're going to be
[36:15] fishes of men and they go fishing you
[36:18] know so so so the young you know we're
[36:21] not the only ones you know who who kind
[36:23] of grow in Revelation we're not the only
[36:25] one that it takes us so long to actually
[36:27] realize hangout and they put Penny drops
[36:30] ding he's like whoa you see these the
[36:33] disciples were the same Simon Peter's
[36:35] the same story and now the Lord's
[36:37] identifying them you know we're going
[36:39] through immature Christians we were
[36:41] immature Christians we're getting there
[36:42] and maybe there's some fresh one
[36:43] starting out but you know we're getting
[36:45] there slowly this this immature
[36:47] Christian but the Lord he asks them now
[36:50] he calls he says children immature
[36:53] Christians children have you any
[36:56] meat now I just want to draw this little
[36:58] picture for the kids it's for the
[37:02] kids it's only for the
[37:06] kids so we have a picture of the Lord
[37:09] Jesus this is a this is going to be a
[37:11] seashore around here and we've got the
[37:15] uh palm tree we've got the Lord Jesus
[37:18] standing
[37:20] here and the Lord is
[37:24] calling calling out what the Lord so we
[37:27] put the pillar of fire above him and
[37:29] here now we have these fish these
[37:32] fishermen
[37:35] okay and I'm not the best drawer believe
[37:37] it or
[37:40] not okay I promis pipper that I would
[37:43] also be drawing she really enjoyed it
[37:45] there's the water and you got the
[37:47] fishermen here on the top and they're
[37:49] holding
[37:50] there that's the
[37:52] Nets okay beautiful
[37:55] Beau so the Lord Jesus is on the
[37:59] seashore the Lord's calling to the
[38:02] disciples now notice we want we really
[38:05] want to catch this Revelation the fact
[38:08] that he's identifying them as as
[38:10] immature Christians he's not saying
[38:12] they're not a Christian he's just
[38:13] identify as their immature Christians
[38:16] and now we notice this is quite
[38:18] phenomenal really we notice how the Lord
[38:19] uses this word
[38:21] meat it uses meat and so we're going to
[38:24] zoom in on this word meat and you'll see
[38:25] why we're going here I'm going to move
[38:26] it to one side again and then we'll just
[38:29] write this word meat
[38:31] down here so this word meat that's
[38:34] written here in the English Bible meat
[38:37] is a Greek word it means
[38:40] Pro
[38:42] proos Fon Fon I probably spelled that
[38:46] wrong Pro
[38:48] Fon and it means something
[38:51] eaten something you'll see what we see
[38:53] where we're going later on something
[38:55] eaten in addition
[38:59] to
[39:01] bread and if you're spiritual you'll
[39:03] already be catching it right
[39:06] especially
[39:08] especially especially I think that's
[39:10] wrong but anyway
[39:12] fish okay and it means meat so it's this
[39:16] is one meaning of it and um this is the
[39:19] other it means
[39:20] meat meat I just spelled that wrong
[39:24] so meat that's it beautiful
[39:28] okay so so this word this particular
[39:30] word this this this this this PR
[39:34] fagon it's believe it or not this is
[39:36] used once in the whole Bible once this
[39:40] specific word is used once it appears
[39:42] once in the whole Bible and it's
[39:44] something in addition to be eaten with
[39:49] bread okay and we know that to eat
[39:53] something you know take the book and eat
[39:54] it to eat something means to be become
[39:57] one with
[39:59] this so to become one with the book to
[40:01] take the book and eat it become one with
[40:03] the book become one with the word and
[40:06] this word appears once and it's specific
[40:09] to what the Lord's saying here it's
[40:12] specific to this revelation we could say
[40:14] that we're going to that we're seeing in
[40:15] this word now notice it's also specific
[40:18] to fish so it's in addition ADV written
[40:21] forgive me that's my mistake here I
[40:24] wrote especially it's
[40:26] specifically forget that it's
[40:29] specifically
[40:32] spefically sorry specifically to fish
[40:36] it's specific the Lord is not just kind
[40:40] of everywhere with his thoughts on this
[40:42] so the Lord's pointing to it being
[40:44] specific so now we see the Lord is
[40:46] calling out which is back here on this
[40:49] one the Lord's calling out to his
[40:51] disciples and he says
[40:54] children pon don't you remember when I
[40:58] first called you this is just Simon
[41:01] putting in now obviously for those he
[41:03] says don't you know remember I said in
[41:05] the future you're going to be fishes of
[41:06] men in the future were you going to be
[41:09] fishes of men and now this is the time
[41:11] when you're supposed to be fishing for
[41:13] you're supposed to be going down this
[41:14] road but you're going down this road
[41:16] you're not supposed to be fishing for
[41:17] fish you're supposed to be fishing for
[41:18] Ben you know he children this this is
[41:21] this word pide on young Christians young
[41:24] immature Christians what are you doing
[41:26] you know you've gone out by yourself
[41:29] you're supposed to be fishes of men you
[41:31] know have you got any fish have you got
[41:33] any this this this Pro proon that's
[41:37] right have you caught something to go
[41:40] with the bread listen have you caught
[41:44] something to be to to that goes together
[41:47] with the
[41:49] bread the Lord said I am the bread of
[41:53] life he's searching for something amen
[41:56] that's going to go with his
[41:58] bread just read John 6:35 I'll read it
[42:01] if you want you right John it's just
[42:03] over the page I think John
[42:06] 6:35 John 6:35 the Lord Jesus said unto
[42:09] them I am the bread of life he that
[42:12] cometh to me shall never hunger and he
[42:15] that believeth on me shall never
[42:18] thirst see the Lord is looking for fish
[42:21] but he's looking for specifically this
[42:24] pron meat to go with the bread of life
[42:29] yes verse 51 I am the living bread which
[42:34] came down from heaven If any man eat of
[42:37] this bread he shall live forever and the
[42:39] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[42:41] I will give for for the life of the
[42:44] world we can go back to John 21 so the
[42:47] Lord is specifically looking for
[42:51] something that's going to go with this
[42:54] bread this
[42:56] bread say amen I can say Amen that was
[42:58] exciting so now the Lord now don't
[43:01] forget the Lord already right at the
[43:03] beginning when the Lord first called
[43:06] these men he already called them to be
[43:08] fishes of men okay already you know from
[43:11] the very first moment he was calling
[43:14] them to hunt my bride he was calling
[43:16] them to catch my
[43:18] bride you know and because here now is
[43:21] the he is he is actually the the bread
[43:23] of life he's needing something to go
[43:26] with the bread of life
[43:28] he needs fish let's read verse 5 again
[43:32] in verse John 21 John
[43:37] 21:5 it says then Jesus said unto them
[43:40] children have ye any meat they answered
[43:43] him
[43:44] no so
[43:47] now I want you to catch
[43:51] this see they had their
[43:55] Nets on the left hand
[43:58] side I want you to it's so simple but it
[44:02] really it thrilled my soul but it's so
[44:05] simple they had their Nets on the left
[44:06] hand
[44:07] side on the left hand side of the boat
[44:10] why did they do that cuz they' always
[44:12] done it that way they'd always done it
[44:15] that way but you see they didn't
[44:18] particularly realize what was going on
[44:21] here they hadn't realized that now we've
[44:26] moved going to draw a dotted line which
[44:28] is going to be the this is time yeah and
[44:31] here is time here now I'm I'm putting
[44:33] this overlapping and here's the cross
[44:35] I'm going to do it in dark here is the
[44:37] cross they haven't realized that we've
[44:40] now moved over into a whole new
[44:44] dispensation okay they have they and and
[44:46] the Lord is now saying remember he's
[44:49] called them to catch fish fishes of men
[44:52] and now they're out fishing but you know
[44:54] on the left hand side well you know
[44:57] we're just going to do as we always did
[44:58] they haven't realized that now we've
[45:00] moved over into this new dispensation of
[45:02] time right and the fish that the Lord
[45:05] has called them to
[45:07] catch wasn't on the left hand side of
[45:10] the boat listen hey it wasn't on the
[45:14] left hand side the fish that he called
[45:17] them to was on the right hand side of
[45:20] the
[45:22] boat
[45:23] mate no longer are we supposed to cast
[45:26] the net into Israel into the left hand
[45:29] side of the boat but the fish that the
[45:32] Lord wants to go with his bread of life
[45:34] is on the right hand side of the boat M
[45:37] that's so simple but hey come on there's
[45:41] a a new dispensation new time changed
[45:45] and they didn't get it they hadn't
[45:46] caught on to it and so the Lord called
[45:49] he doesn't say they're not Christians he
[45:51] just says they're immature Christians
[45:53] there's nothing wrong with being
[45:54] immature Christian there's nothing wrong
[45:56] with the youngest kid and just just just
[45:58] just just praising the Lord and just
[45:59] being kids there's nothing wrong with
[46:01] that but there comes a time where we're
[46:03] called to something higher there's a new
[46:07] testament Bride on this hand side of the
[46:10] boat that's got to be
[46:12] caught
[46:13] mate the Lord's good see the word had
[46:16] come to the children of Israel the word
[46:19] had come they rejected
[46:21] him I'll read it John
[46:24] 1:11 John 1:1
[46:27] he came unto his own and his own
[46:30] received him not the Lord came to his
[46:32] own he came he cast the net on the left
[46:35] hand side of the boat yeah he did it and
[46:38] they rejected him yeah but now the Lord
[46:42] is pointing him saying whoa whoa whoa uh
[46:45] what I put that thing there whoa um I
[46:47] don't know how this works to delete it
[46:49] anyway just forget this one big no no
[46:52] big no no cast that on the other side so
[46:55] now the Net's cast on the other side
[46:58] side the Lord is telling them he's
[47:00] pointing them in the right direction
[47:02] let's read John 21 go back to John
[47:06] 21:6 it takes the Lord to come
[47:09] personally he came personally to call
[47:11] him he told them what the future was
[47:14] going to be but now it how many times is
[47:17] that how many
[47:18] times any of you you feel a tug on your
[47:22] heart when you're
[47:23] young and then you kind of turn for a
[47:26] while and and maybe not but the Lord
[47:29] comes
[47:30] personally whoever in you have to put
[47:32] your hands up whoever in here has had a
[47:34] total life change absolutely tell me
[47:37] that the Lord didn't come personally to
[47:39] you personally see sometimes the Lord
[47:42] just comes personally let's read John 21
[47:45] let's read verse
[47:46] 6 verse 6 and he said unto them cast the
[47:52] net on the right hand side on the right
[47:54] side of the ship and ye shall find what
[47:58] are they going to find listen he doesn't
[48:01] say have you got any fish normal fish
[48:04] he's asking have you got any fish
[48:07] specifically something that's going to
[48:08] go with my bread specifically he's
[48:11] asking them for a specific PR fagon I
[48:14] think that's the right word um yeah
[48:16] that's the one he's specifically looking
[48:19] for a specific fish the Lord's not
[48:22] talking about fish he's talking about
[48:23] fish fish if you know what I'm saying so
[48:26] verse six and s him casting it on the
[48:27] right side on the right side of the ship
[48:28] and ye shall find they cast
[48:31] therefore now they were not able to draw
[48:34] for the multitude of
[48:36] fishes you
[48:39] see he points them to the right side of
[48:42] the
[48:42] ship it's the place where his fish are
[48:46] it's the place where the ones that he
[48:48] wants to catch that's where they
[48:50] are let's read
[48:53] uh Divine Healing 195
[48:58] for brother I'm talking about the first
[49:00] Commission of the the apostles the first
[49:03] commission so this is just where he says
[49:05] he says what was the first commission he
[49:06] ever gave to his Apostles you like me to
[49:09] read to you it's found in the 10th
[49:11] chapter of Matthew Jesus commissioned
[49:13] his disciples said go out heal the sick
[49:15] cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast
[49:16] out Devils as freely as you have
[49:18] received freely give Matthew 10th
[49:20] chapter is that right that's his first
[49:22] commission to his Apostles so we just
[49:24] want to read we want want to read that
[49:28] so turn to Matthew 10 if we could
[49:30] Matthew
[49:31] 10 Matthew chapter
[49:33] 10 and if we notice then as we read this
[49:36] we will see that the first commission
[49:39] that the lord gave was to the
[49:42] Jews it was to the left hand side of the
[49:46] boat yes see it was the left hand side
[49:50] so he says here we're going to read 5
[49:53] verse 5 to verse 8 I think I've got
[49:55] written here 5 to8 says these TW uh
[49:58] Jesus sent forth and commanded them
[50:00] saying go not the way of the Gentiles or
[50:04] into any city of the Samaritans enter ye
[50:07] not hey guys go fishing don't throw it
[50:12] on the right hand side don't th so now
[50:14] we see another picture is that the guys
[50:16] are on the left hand side well this is
[50:17] what the lord always Tau us this is how
[50:19] he did it yeah but they haven't realized
[50:21] what's happened so so he tells them
[50:24] don't whatever you do do not I repat do
[50:27] not put the net on the right hand side
[50:30] the scriptures got to be fulfilled that
[50:31] I'm coming to my own okay so verse uh
[50:34] what do we say verse verse 5 to8 these
[50:36] 12 sent ye Jesus forth commanded them
[50:37] saying go not in the way of the Gentiles
[50:39] or in any way of the any city of the
[50:40] Samaritans enter you not but go rather
[50:42] to the lost sheep of the House of Israel
[50:47] and as you go preach saying the Kingdom
[50:48] of Heaven is at hand heal the sick claim
[50:51] the cleanse the lepers raise the Dead
[50:53] cast out Devils freely ye have received
[50:56] freely
[50:59] give so we see now this specific
[51:02] commission the Lord's giving only go to
[51:04] the
[51:06] Jews and I said it before I'll say again
[51:08] the Lord's saying I repeat do not
[51:11] whatever you do
[51:12] not cast that net on the right hand side
[51:17] don't that's that side for you guys
[51:18] don't cast it on the right hand
[51:20] side only go to the Lost House of Israel
[51:24] do not go to the gentille
[51:29] he came to his own his own received him
[51:30] not okay should we once more brother
[51:32] what I'm saying cuz there's two now this
[51:35] is now the commission for after the
[51:38] commission now comes for after into the
[51:40] new dispensation so says once more 1963
[51:43] he says so here we stand a church
[51:47] commissioned on the last commission the
[51:50] last thing that Jesus said to his church
[51:53] the last commission given go ye into all
[51:56] all the world see now no longer it's no
[51:58] longer going just to the Lost House of
[52:00] Israel now it's going to all the world
[52:03] if we were clever we might even just say
[52:05] well it's just a silly picture but you
[52:07] know the net on the left hand side has
[52:08] only got 200 cubits to
[52:11] sh the net on the right hand side is all
[52:13] the world you've got a fairish ocean to
[52:16] go out there and I've just done this and
[52:18] I don't know what I'm doing here oh here
[52:20] we go let me just
[52:22] uh okay where was I quote from that's it
[52:25] so it says go into all the world and
[52:27] Make Disciples of all Nations he that
[52:31] believeth um and is baptized shall be
[52:33] saved he that believeth not shall be
[52:35] damned and in this and and is a and is a
[52:39] conjunction so basically brother I'm
[52:41] saying it ties it together to and is a
[52:43] conjunction to tie your sentence
[52:44] together and these things shall follow
[52:47] them that believe in my name they shall
[52:48] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[52:50] you tongues if they take upstairs
[52:51] serpents or drink deadly things it will
[52:53] not harm them if they lay hands on the
[52:55] sick they shall recover
[52:57] so now we see there is another
[53:00] commission and this time we are casting
[53:03] the net on the right hand side of the
[53:05] ship that's this side for you guys okay
[53:07] and I want to read this scripture that
[53:09] brother M's just U mentioned here which
[53:11] is Mark chapter 16 Mark chapter
[53:14] 16 we a little bit in the scriptures but
[53:17] it's
[53:19] fine Mark chapter
[53:22] 16 and we will read 15 to 20
[53:29] Lord Jesus and he said unto them go ye
[53:31] into all the world preach the gospel to
[53:34] Every Creature see it's no longer only
[53:37] to a certain group it's no longer to the
[53:39] old leftand side of the ship now we're
[53:42] not just going into into into the Cove
[53:45] small like a limited now it's just
[53:47] totally unlimited now now it's to the
[53:49] whole world says go into all the world
[53:52] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[53:54] verse 16 he that believeth and and he's
[53:56] baptized shall be saved but he that
[53:59] believeth not shall be damned and now
[54:00] this is what brother R says he says and
[54:02] the Seas and brother B puts in there
[54:04] that's where we read it he says it's to
[54:05] tie the sentence together these two
[54:07] things belong together so he says and
[54:09] these signs shall follow them that
[54:11] believe in my name shall they cast out
[54:13] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[54:15] they shall tape up serpents and if they
[54:18] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[54:20] them they sh shall lay hands on the sick
[54:23] and they shall recover so then after the
[54:26] Lord had spoken did I say 20 yep so then
[54:28] after the Lord had spoken unto them he
[54:29] was received up into heaven and sat on
[54:31] the right hand of God and they went
[54:33] forth and preached everywhere the the
[54:36] the Lord working with them and
[54:37] confirming the word word with signs
[54:40] following
[54:41] amen
[54:43] so if we notice as brother R says he
[54:47] says we
[54:48] stand he say brother says so here we
[54:51] stand a church commissioned on the last
[54:54] Commission Now if you when you kind of
[54:56] see who you are and what the role of the
[54:57] bride of Christ is which we're all we're
[55:00] all seeing now um you understand what
[55:03] he's saying here we've got the same
[55:05] commission amen not just here each one
[55:08] of us we stand here we stand a church
[55:10] commissioned on the last commission we
[55:13] have got a commission to cast The Net
[55:16] into all the
[55:17] world yeah to catch fish but
[55:22] specifically this PR fagon specifically
[55:27] so if we you move on a little bit now go
[55:28] back to John chapter 21 if we could John
[55:31] chapter 21 let's move on a little
[55:33] [Music]
[55:34] bit okay just read verse 6 to verse
[55:40] 11 and he said unto them cast the net on
[55:43] the right side of the ship and ye shall
[55:46] find they cast therefore and now they
[55:48] were not able to draw it for the
[55:50] multitude of fishes therefore that
[55:53] disciple who Jesus loved said unto Peter
[55:55] it is the Lord now when Simon Peter
[55:57] heard that it was the Lord he G his
[55:59] fish's coat unto him for he was naked
[56:01] and did cast himself into the sea and
[56:03] the other disciples came in a little
[56:05] ship for they were not far from Land as
[56:07] it were 200 cubits dragging the net with
[56:10] fishes uh to land uh and as soon as they
[56:13] were come to land they saw a fire of
[56:15] coals there and fish laid thereon and
[56:17] bread and Jesus said unto them bring the
[56:20] fishes which ye have now caught Simon
[56:24] Peter went up and Drew the net to land
[56:26] full of great fishes 150 and three for
[56:30] they were all there and and for all
[56:33] there were so many yet the net was not
[56:35] broken
[56:37] amazing so we've seen how the net was
[56:40] cast on the left hand side and there was
[56:43] no fish the reason there was no fish is
[56:46] because the dispensation now changed and
[56:48] they' refused the Lord theyd refused the
[56:50] Lord there's no fish to be caught there
[56:52] but now that the Net's cast in on the
[56:54] right side in the right place place
[56:57] right this gospel net of Grace is cast
[57:00] into the right place it's so full that
[57:03] the net is almost
[57:05] breaking and if we notice there was only
[57:08] 153 fish there must have been really big
[57:12] fish you know I I actually took this out
[57:14] of my notes it's
[57:15] just you don't ever want to make the
[57:17] scriptures say something I I discussed
[57:19] this with a brother not not on this
[57:21] subject something else and he's an
[57:22] accountant down in London Brother David
[57:24] and he just he just loves the scriptures
[57:26] and we were just talking about um
[57:28] numbers he's into like numerology and
[57:29] things which is awesome You See It All
[57:31] Through the Bible and he says and and I
[57:33] just said oh I I think I was preaching
[57:34] on Simon being discouraged or whatever
[57:36] once down in down there and and and he
[57:38] said oh he said you know 153 I said you
[57:40] know there's not many fish 100 it's
[57:43] actually not
[57:45] many and so we looked at this 153 and
[57:48] and we were discussing certain things he
[57:50] said you know he said somewhere there's
[57:51] a scripture that talks about
[57:54] 153 I was like okay fine anyway you
[57:57] messaged me I wasn't going to read it
[57:59] but 2 Chronicles 2 Chronicles I think
[58:04] it's second chonicles
[58:05] 2 because we're looking look we're
[58:07] looking at we're seeing this picture and
[58:10] for me that's why I like to say it's
[58:12] like the diamond we just turn the
[58:14] diamond I'm not trying to bring some
[58:15] weird something else you turn the
[58:16] diamond you just seen something this is
[58:18] the first time I'd seen this and it's
[58:19] like it's encouraging and it fits with
[58:22] the word it fits with the picture it's
[58:23] like yes but we're looking now the
[58:26] casting the net on the right hand side
[58:27] it's Gentiles Gentiles yes did I say the
[58:31] word Gentiles yes okay read 2
[58:35] Chronicles 2 this is the scripture that
[58:37] he sent
[58:38] me verse 17 is awesome I like
[58:42] it and Solomon numbered all the
[58:44] strangers that were in the land of
[58:46] Israel pause look up look up
[58:49] Richie a stranger in the land of Egypt
[58:52] is defined as
[58:54] what Gentile stranger in the land now
[58:57] you can put your head
[58:58] down and Solomon numbered all the
[59:00] strangers that were in the of Israel
[59:02] after the numbering where with David his
[59:04] father had numbered them and they were
[59:06] found
[59:08] 150,000 and
[59:10] 3,600 153,000 and 600 so there's 153
[59:14] again and it's also in relation to
[59:18] Gentiles so 153 this time it's not 153
[59:21] it's 153,000 and the 600 but you've got
[59:25] that 153 so on a sliding scale it's see
[59:28] what I mean it's just a nice type I like
[59:31] it back to John
[59:34] 21 but notice these 153 fish now they
[59:40] they they it's not a big number but they
[59:43] were great fishes it says in the
[59:44] Scripture it says they were great fishes
[59:47] we've been we've been fishing a few
[59:48] years ago we went it was the most
[59:49] ridiculous fishing trip we've been on up
[59:52] on out on the sea on a charter with with
[59:53] the Brethren from another church they
[59:55] organized it we just came back we got
[59:57] the feed bags you know the feed bags for
[59:58] the for the corn we came back with two
[1:00:00] of those full and every brother I mean
[1:00:02] we've got hundreds but like just in a
[1:00:05] few
[1:00:06] bags and they were like mackerel the
[1:00:09] point is is that 153 fish would fit into
[1:00:13] if they were normal like they' fit into
[1:00:15] a couple of bags so what's special about
[1:00:17] these fish because it almost broke the
[1:00:19] net you see in the fish in the natural
[1:00:22] 153 yeah it sounds like a lot and if you
[1:00:25] they've got to be big ones to break the
[1:00:26] net you imagine how SI the size of their
[1:00:29] fishing nets they weren messing about
[1:00:30] they were professionals he's almost
[1:00:33] breaking the net so they were huge fish
[1:00:37] these fish that the Lord C trust me if
[1:00:40] the Lord is trying to type to them stop
[1:00:41] casting in the left hand side cast in
[1:00:43] the right and then that's where you're
[1:00:44] going to find him you're not going to
[1:00:45] find him in the Old Testament anymore
[1:00:46] guys you're not going to find it oh yeah
[1:00:48] but we've always gone to the synagogue
[1:00:49] and the priest so he's done the work
[1:00:51] yeah yeah but now I've asked you to do
[1:00:52] it yeah but but but no buts goats but
[1:00:56] check it out go to the right hand side
[1:00:58] so now we go to the right hand side now
[1:01:00] suddenly there's these fish and the
[1:01:03] Lord's trust me he's not going to let
[1:01:05] them catch fish that come like this
[1:01:08] trust me they're going to be like
[1:01:09] stunning fish they're going to be
[1:01:12] huge you know the the Lord is catching
[1:01:15] them now we're on the right hand side
[1:01:16] he's using these five-fold Ministries
[1:01:18] he's using everything he's using his
[1:01:20] body every single thing um the testimony

[1:01:32] thinking oh why why why did I have to go
[1:01:34] through that all them years why didn't
[1:01:35] the Lord hear me earlier because you've
[1:01:37] got to be that testimony so you go
[1:01:40] through that all that time now suddenly
[1:01:41] you've got this testimony everyone

[1:01:46] and that is you throwing the net out

[1:05:19] turn around and say oh that was only for
[1:05:20] the disciples I'm going to ask you a
[1:05:21] question how do the
[1:05:23] disciples go into all the World by

[1:05:38] carry the message someone's got to do
[1:05:41] the work and the Lord's got a way of
[1:05:43] doing it the Lord never changes his way
[1:05:45] of doing things once he sets he says I'm
[1:05:47] doing it this way he's going to do it

[1:06:11] we're living that life each one of us I
[1:06:13] just want to read verse 15 verse 16
[1:06:15] again and he said unto them go ye into
[1:06:17] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:06:19] Every Creature he that believeth and is
[1:06:23] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:06:26] believeth not shall be
[1:06:28] damned you know
[1:06:31] yesterday I was turning my
[1:06:33] scriptures and this dropped out you all
[1:06:36] know what this is it's it's a it's it's
[1:06:39] A1 $1 note and I picked it
[1:06:43] up and it was at a time when um i' just
[1:06:46] been to
[1:06:47] um brother Franco and Sister Amy been to
[1:06:50] their place and she was telling about oh
[1:06:52] you know sometimes with the Chads just
[1:06:54] says oh you know 9: at night and and the
[1:06:56] direction changes he like oh what are we
[1:06:58] going to do I get that as well and I was
[1:07:00] just thinking Lord please no she not
[1:07:02] spoken to me
[1:07:04] please but late last night I just
[1:07:06] thought oh Lord which which which way
[1:07:08] and I opened my Bible and this fell out
[1:07:10] it was a $1 note now you all know it I'm
[1:07:12] not going to go all like Technical and
[1:07:14] look at all the arrows and the 13 stars
[1:07:15] and the pyramid and all that no no on
[1:07:17] the front there's an inscription and it
[1:07:20] says this note is legal tender for all
[1:07:24] debts put public and private I was like
[1:07:28] boom that's it I thought wow this word
[1:07:32] is legal
[1:07:34] tender to cover all debts public and
[1:07:38] private all debts are covered by this
[1:07:40] one it's amazing I just saw I saw it I
[1:07:42] thought you know this is our net that
[1:07:44] we're casting out but you know it's in
[1:07:47] word form still but it's also in flesh
[1:07:49] form so that's why I say wherever you
[1:07:52] are you are that net being cast out amen
[1:07:55] we are the these written Epistles with
[1:07:57] this written word and you are displaying
[1:07:59] the fact that that this legal tender
[1:08:01] this one is Illegal Tender for all debts
[1:08:06] public and private I just thought that's
[1:08:07] amazing that's what this gospel is the
[1:08:10] gospel is the legal tender that will
[1:08:12] cover all our debts it's if you give
[1:08:15] that to any sin that you've got you lay
[1:08:17] that on the table and it's covered it's
[1:08:20] done you know the gospel the message of
[1:08:22] Grace this message that we carry is
[1:08:24] freely we've received it freely give
[1:08:27] tell me how our commission is different
[1:08:29] to the commission the lord gave the
[1:08:30] first disciples other than being on the
[1:08:32] right hand side of the ship we got it
[1:08:35] freely we didn't do nothing for it he
[1:08:37] gave it to us and we're just saying look
[1:08:39] take the money just take it just take it
[1:08:42] cover the debt it's done that's what
[1:08:44] we're doing and that's what our life is
[1:08:46] our life is reflecting that you know
[1:08:48] there's a price that's been paid for
[1:08:50] everything and you know we are these
[1:08:53] written Epistles we are the word of God
[1:08:54] listen an epistle for the kids is it's a
[1:08:57] letter right so if you look if you read
[1:09:00] through the Bible and you go to the
[1:09:01] first the first book of of Mark it's The
[1:09:03] Gospel According to Mark and you read
[1:09:05] the Ephesians go to Ephesians that's an
[1:09:07] easier one it says the official the
[1:09:09] Epistle of Paul to the Apostle of the
[1:09:11] Ephesians and it goes on through it's an
[1:09:13] epistle it's a letter it's written it's
[1:09:15] a written form of something so if the
[1:09:17] scripture tells us that we are written
[1:09:19] Epistles read of all
[1:09:21] men then you are walking Living Word of
[1:09:25] God
[1:09:26] am I stupid did I say that wrong no
[1:09:27] that's what it is so so if we are
[1:09:29] written we are the word made flesh we
[1:09:33] word the word displayed in flesh you
[1:09:37] know and and and we are displaying the
[1:09:39] the resurrection power of the lord we
[1:09:42] are witness we are um we are proof of
[1:09:46] his resurrection the fact that we live
[1:09:49] ye I live the you shall live also he's
[1:09:51] telling us that and now the fact that
[1:09:52] we're here and we're alive and it's a
[1:09:54] paradox because yeah we're dying but
[1:09:56] we're alive we're die we're dead but we
[1:09:58] live we live but but we're alive we
[1:10:00] can't die the realist can't die we we
[1:10:02] are proof of his
[1:10:04] resurrection you know the world will see
[1:10:08] him and only can see him in a bride form
[1:10:12] now and the light of the Lord the light
[1:10:14] of his word which moves on moves on is
[1:10:18] it's him in her it's him in her it's
[1:10:21] it's the Lord just taking on flesh again
[1:10:23] you know the Lord the Lord just picked
[1:10:25] up dust and spoke to um to Abraham the
[1:10:28] Lord picked up dust he stands in anyone
[1:10:29] and the Lord p stand picks up your dust
[1:10:31] and he's standing in you and it's this
[1:10:33] gospel net that's always being thrown
[1:10:35] out you want to read this I think it's
[1:10:37] the last quote Christ is the mystery of
[1:10:39] God revealed and I'm going to it's
[1:10:40] paragraph 591 595 and 611 I'm just going
[1:10:44] to read the highlighted
[1:10:45] bits it says the headship and the we
[1:10:48] know all this the headship and the body
[1:10:50] has become one unit it's God manifest in
[1:10:54] his people that's the reason the husband
[1:10:56] and wife is no longer Twain they're one
[1:10:58] God and his church is one Christ in you
[1:11:01] God's Great Revelation glory to God even
[1:11:04] bearing his name his name is Jesus the
[1:11:06] anointed see if we're the anointed
[1:11:09] bride then how we've we've taken on his
[1:11:12] name we've taken on his name we are the
[1:11:14] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ paragraph
[1:11:16] 595 is the whole paragraph uh and the
[1:11:19] word moves on down into the body from
[1:11:21] the head what is it it's the same word
[1:11:22] nothing can be added or taken from so
[1:11:24] the same word that moves from the head
[1:11:27] as the day comes close down into the
[1:11:29] body down into the body vindicating that
[1:11:32] they are one the husband sorry they are
[1:11:34] they are husband and wife they are flesh
[1:11:36] of his flesh word of his word life of
[1:11:39] his life Spirit of his Spirit see amen
[1:11:42] how do you know it it Bears the same
[1:11:44] record the same fruit the same word see
[1:11:47] it manifests Christ the same life same
[1:11:49] God Same Spirit same word same book amen
[1:11:52] same signs the things that I do shall
[1:11:55] you you also oh my Hallelujah listen and
[1:11:58] then you sit there and you yes but I
[1:12:01] don't have the spirit of
[1:12:02] discernment and you walk away you're not
[1:12:04] called to so what you can do go fishing
[1:12:07] no but there's others around here look
[1:12:10] you know oh but I'm not called to preach
[1:12:13] so the preacher not called to play the
[1:12:15] guitar like brother John and brother
[1:12:16] Steven and Josiah you know they they
[1:12:19] they're ministering in a different way
[1:12:21] but we're all part of this body it's all
[1:12:23] part of the same gospel it's all part of
[1:12:25] the message it's all part of the Lord
[1:12:27] Jesus Christ in flesh just in different
[1:12:30] parts of it's a God manifesting himself
[1:12:32] through uh 611 we're not all called we
[1:12:36] are not all called and the Lord the word
[1:12:38] comes to the prophet you know I said the
[1:12:40] the the the um the uh the Lord doesn't
[1:12:42] change his way of doing things when when
[1:12:44] when the people said no no no no don't
[1:12:46] let God speak let let let a man speak
[1:12:48] the Lord says well that's fine I'll do
[1:12:50] that from now on hence the word of the
[1:12:52] Lord only comes to the prophets so yeah
[1:12:54] we can take this word
[1:12:55] but the word comes to the prophets I'm
[1:12:58] thankful we've got a prophet in our day
[1:12:59] that the Lord came to spoke his word and
[1:13:01] we can carry that on and now we can open
[1:13:02] and we can see clearly holding the two
[1:13:04] things together I'm thankful paragraph
[1:13:07] 611 I can read the whole paragraph So
[1:13:09] that because I've just highlighted the
[1:13:10] middle piece H's Church stands alone
[1:13:12] she's not hooked with nothing but he was
[1:13:14] but he was identified by God being the
[1:13:16] body that God dwelt in and the church is
[1:13:19] identified by his body doing the same
[1:13:22] thing listen I want you to catch this
[1:13:23] the church is ident identified he was
[1:13:26] listen he was
[1:13:27] identified by um he was identified by
[1:13:31] God being the body that God dwelt in and
[1:13:34] the church is identified by his body
[1:13:37] doing the same thing amen she is his
[1:13:40] body the manifested truth of his
[1:13:42] promised word for the last days so look
[1:13:45] the Lord Jesus is
[1:13:46] identified being the body that God dwelt
[1:13:49] in okay and the church is identified by
[1:13:54] his body doing the same thing remember
[1:13:57] all that God was according to Christ all
[1:13:59] that Christ was according to the church
[1:14:02] we the church are standing here with
[1:14:04] this
[1:14:05] commission he's chosen us to continue
[1:14:08] that work he's chosen us to continue
[1:14:12] throwing the net out to the world the
[1:14:15] lord is you know the Lord has chosen to
[1:14:17] show the world to show himself to the
[1:14:21] world through his bride we see it in the
[1:14:23] type of uh King aah Horus and yashi was
[1:14:27] it yashi or something y yeah that one
[1:14:30] she's not worth mentioning really well
[1:14:33] you know the Lord wanted to put on sorry
[1:14:35] the Lord aurus wanted to put her on show
[1:14:37] and she was like yanah so he said Yana
[1:14:40] and got another one see what I mean so
[1:14:42] the you know cast on the left hand side
[1:14:43] of the ship and she says yanan so he's
[1:14:45] like okay Y and I'll get one that's
[1:14:47] worthy then comes Queen Ester see what I
[1:14:49] mean one that one that the Lord can show
[1:14:51] off one that the Lord can can put the
[1:14:54] the clothes
[1:14:55] with the clothing the righteousness of
[1:14:57] of of his word he can clothe her in that
[1:14:59] and he can say this to the world this is
[1:15:02] it this is the one see see he was
[1:15:05] identified by God being the body that
[1:15:08] God dwelt in the church is identified by
[1:15:11] his body doing the same thing see what I
[1:15:14] mean mate see we are the word made flesh
[1:15:19] you know the scripture says the Lord
[1:15:21] says no man lights a candle and then
[1:15:24] covers it puts it under a bushel nobody

[1:15:38] because we'll be here hours but listen
[1:15:40] the glory of the man is the woman amen
[1:15:43] the glory of the man is the woman is it
[1:15:45] any different for Christ than the bride
[1:15:47] no so he wants to show his bride he's
[1:15:49] chos it's the place he's chosen to show
[1:15:52] you know the scripture um the glor um

[1:16:47] right hand side and then he says he says
[1:16:49] now you bring of the fish that you've

[1:18:16] being reflected and the glory isn't just
[1:18:17] some fancy fancy schmancy it's just this
[1:18:21] this radiation of of
[1:18:23] godliness we're thankful for that you
[1:18:27] know the Lord is still
[1:18:29] fishing but now the net he's using is

[1:21:24] what I mean so everybody wants to be I
[1:21:27] ask we the bride of Christ wo whoa wo
[1:21:30] then live the
[1:21:31] life yes well I think I'll leave that
[1:21:34] little bit out thank you very much fine
[1:21:36] just shows who you are the king the king
[1:21:38] will just get another one as it were you
[1:21:40] know all you're actually not called to
[1:21:43] be see we have to live that life who
[1:21:47] else is going to see the word and read
[1:21:49] the word in your life if we're not here
[1:21:51] or if we live shut up in a box
[1:21:55] in a jungle cuz I mean I mean I'm be
[1:21:58] honest with like when I was younger I
[1:21:59] thought does does people second world
[1:22:01] war didn't really affect like maybe
[1:22:02] daily life like it did us as much I know
[1:22:05] it did but for us it goes deep as
[1:22:07] English U and I heard about um those
[1:22:11] families that had felt the leading of
[1:22:13] the Lord I guess um before the um first
[1:22:16] and second world war and they moved out
[1:22:18] to Siberia in Russia I mean you can it's
[1:22:21] like car drive like
[1:22:25] 5 weeks and you'll be in the middle of
[1:22:27] it it's it's just so huge it's just huge
[1:22:29] and no one lives there I think it's
[1:22:31] called the tundra is it the tundra
[1:22:32] that's it yeah Tundra not Siberia Tundra
[1:22:35] right and these families moved there
[1:22:37] lived there and they lived through the
[1:22:39] first world war and the second world war
[1:22:41] they never even knew anything happened
[1:22:43] and after all these like like couple of
[1:22:45] generations down whatever it was they
[1:22:47] came back to reality was like mate
[1:22:48] what's going on here but they just
[1:22:50] literally the family probably believing
[1:22:51] believing family felt to move out there
[1:22:54] and so you're talking like they never
[1:22:56] even knew the first world war or the
[1:22:58] second world war even
[1:23:00] happened and I used to think as a young
[1:23:02] Christian I used to think you know I
[1:23:04] could live out there maybe brother Brown
[1:23:06] was thinking the same thing you know
[1:23:08] what I'm saying up to Alaska with family
[1:23:10] and with the kids and just just leave it
[1:23:11] foret maybe it's the same thing I felt
[1:23:13] the same way I thought you know if we
[1:23:14] could just go up to the tundra somewhere
[1:23:16] you know just just live and just hunt
[1:23:18] and just just be imagine you don't you
[1:23:20] don't have to ask anyone where to live
[1:23:21] you just live you don't have to buy a
[1:23:23] house you don't have to get a mortgage
[1:23:24] you don't have to have money you just
[1:23:25] live like oh I'm hungry let's go and get
[1:23:27] a deer let's go fishing or something
[1:23:28] it's just but then who's going to who's
[1:23:32] going to see Christ through me see this
[1:23:36] is the whole bushel in the candle thing
[1:23:37] sometimes we want to just go fishing
[1:23:40] sometimes we just want to I just just go
[1:23:42] just just hide somewhere and the Lord's
[1:23:44] got a different plan for us because if
[1:23:45] we're the final voice to the final age
[1:23:47] then how is anyone going to see us if
[1:23:48] we're up in tundra you know what I mean
[1:23:51] how is it going to work the world will
[1:23:54] not not read the Bible forget
[1:23:57] it America is probably the number one
[1:24:00] Bible reading nation in the world you
[1:24:01] say laugh and say no believe me you
[1:24:04] are all you got to do is drive down to
[1:24:06] Cincinnati you know what I'm
[1:24:08] saying like 50 foot signs everywhere so
[1:24:11] they're reading the Bible but not
[1:24:12] reading the Bible so no one's going to
[1:24:15] actually physically pick up the Bible
[1:24:16] and read it with any intent of learning
[1:24:17] anything so how are they going to know
[1:24:19] what's right and wrong how are they
[1:24:21] going to know they'll only see it
[1:24:23] through you
[1:24:25] through you they will see
[1:24:26] it and you know it'll come down to only
[1:24:30] those that are foreordained to see it
[1:24:32] will see it see don't forget we're
[1:24:34] throwing the net out and the Lord is
[1:24:36] watching over who comes into that
[1:24:39] net I'd like to read to Second
[1:24:41] Corinthians if I
[1:24:43] could second
[1:24:46] Corinthians and it's verse chapter 12
[1:24:49] chapter
[1:24:53] 12 so 2 Corinthians
[1:24:56] 12 second Corinthians 12 and we'll read
[1:24:59] 15- 19 15-
[1:25:04] 19 Paul says and I will very gladly
[1:25:08] spend and be spent for you though more
[1:25:11] abundantly I love you the less I
[1:25:13] beloved but be it so I did not burden
[1:25:17] you neither nevertheless being crafty I
[1:25:20] caught you with Gile I like this did I
[1:25:23] make Gain of you by any of them who I
[1:25:25] said unto you I desire Titus and with
[1:25:27] him I sent a brother did Titus make Gain
[1:25:28] of you walk not we in the same Spirit
[1:25:30] walk we not in the same steps again
[1:25:33] think he that we excuse ourselves unto
[1:25:35] you we speak before God in Christ but we
[1:25:39] do all things dearly beloved for your
[1:25:42] edifying so notice here Paul describes
[1:25:46] the way that he is living his life
[1:25:49] sister
[1:25:50] Joyce he catches them with Gile and I'm
[1:25:54] pict see Joy because you know she's the
[1:25:56] first one that I can see him she's
[1:25:58] always smiling so it's like you know I
[1:26:01] really feel a burden to talk to
[1:26:03] um
[1:26:05] sge so it's like how are we going to do
[1:26:09] it well it's a birthday let's just slide
[1:26:12] over there and bring our favorite cake
[1:26:14] and maybe just slip a little scripture
[1:26:16] on the bottom or use my favorite little
[1:26:19] dish that when she's eating the pie in
[1:26:21] the bottom it's got a scripture repent
[1:26:24] and be
[1:26:27] baptized but she knows that you know
[1:26:30] everybody after they've had a nice pie
[1:26:33] they're going to be a bit Dopey they're
[1:26:35] going to be like ooh what's
[1:26:37] this the point is it's catching people
[1:26:40] with Gile
[1:26:42] craftiness the Lord Jesus said in
[1:26:45] Matthew 6 10:16 he says be wise as
[1:26:50] serpents harmless as doves now we know
[1:26:52] that at that point in time he he the
[1:26:54] Lord Jesus is in fact we'll read it
[1:26:56] quickly just just CU to get to make sure
[1:26:58] that you're understanding uh Matthew
[1:27:00] 10:1 16 Matthew
[1:27:03] 10:16 Matthew
[1:27:07] 1016 so yeah that's right so remember
[1:27:10] the Lord Jesus he's sending them out
[1:27:12] into he's actually sending out into the
[1:27:13] left hand side of the ship okay and he
[1:27:16] says behold I send you forth a sheep
[1:27:19] into the midst of
[1:27:20] wolves be ye therefore wise a serpent
[1:27:23] and harm as doves so now when we go out
[1:27:26] into the world yeah we're going out into
[1:27:30] wolves but we don't know if there's a
[1:27:32] sheep there see so we have to be so yeah
[1:27:35] although this is he's sending them out
[1:27:36] knowing that they're going into wolves
[1:27:38] I'm not saying the reason I've said this
[1:27:39] is otherwise you're going to be when you
[1:27:41] go out there and you cast your NS to
[1:27:42] Joyce you're going to be like I'm going
[1:27:43] to make this cake but she's a wolf and
[1:27:46] you're going to put it on the thing and
[1:27:46] walk back cuz you don't want to get
[1:27:48] bitten the point is we don't know who's
[1:27:50] who but we still got to be wise as
[1:27:52] serpents harmless as doves you just got
[1:27:53] to be loving be kind we don't know you
[1:27:56] know we don't know where the fish are we
[1:27:59] just C the net we don't know who the
[1:28:02] bride is and who not we just cast a net
[1:28:06] but one thing we know that there will be
[1:28:08] a bride and it'll the Nets will be
[1:28:10] bursting but they won't break yeah
[1:28:13] there'll be so many 153 fish is not a
[1:28:16] massive number but it's quality that the
[1:28:19] Lord's looking for the Lord is looking
[1:28:21] for quality and remember the third pool
[1:28:24] was to cat the big
[1:28:25] fish you know the the the the quality
[1:28:28] and you know you could say I'm not going
[1:28:29] to get into the fishing techniques but
[1:28:30] brother Jack will tell us that one but
[1:28:33] it's like you know if you want to catch
[1:28:34] certain fish you got to stick certain
[1:28:35] bait on the hook you know what I mean I
[1:28:37] know how to catch trout that's about it
[1:28:39] you know I'm not I'm not I'm not you
[1:28:40] know I just if I go somewhere else oh
[1:28:42] we're going to catch crappy whatever
[1:28:44] they are it's like okay fine just use
[1:28:45] this and this it's like okay fine you
[1:28:47] know oh we're going to catch sge who she
[1:28:49] likes the raspberry Tarts yep you know
[1:28:51] what I mean oh you know brother John's
[1:28:53] going to catch it
[1:28:54] Nathan whoever he works with whatever he
[1:28:56] is oh yeah he likes this and this and
[1:28:57] this well what are you going to do
[1:28:59] brother Brown did the same thing go and
[1:29:01] look at cars oh are the good cars oh
[1:29:03] real good cars yeah yeah you know about
[1:29:04] convention you know he is he goes on
[1:29:06] talks about if you if it's a farmer talk
[1:29:07] about crops if it's a mechanic talk
[1:29:09] about brother richy talk
[1:29:11] about technical machines I don't have a
[1:29:13] clue what they are but he looks
[1:29:15] good and just sit there and Nod and say
[1:29:17] yeah brother brother Richie they're good
[1:29:18] machines then slide it push it make it
[1:29:20] look like you know what you're doing I
[1:29:22] don't do you see what I'm saying it's
[1:29:24] like this this is a craftiness it's not
[1:29:26] like a a nastiness it's just being
[1:29:29] clever it's actually following the lead
[1:29:30] in the
[1:29:32] spirit the Lord has called this quality
[1:29:35] bride and I could put it on here I
[1:29:36] suppose because this has stayed still
[1:29:38] now for quite a while uh and we run out
[1:29:41] of time uh run out of space here as well
[1:29:43] so here on this timeline here you know
[1:29:47] as time goes on we have here this is the
[1:29:50] uh the cross here we have one 2 3 4 five
[1:29:53] six so we've got these six one 2 3 4
[1:29:57] five six and then uh that's it seven so
[1:30:01] the point is we've got these seven
[1:30:03] Church ages that are along here so this
[1:30:04] is the time now this suddenly becomes a
[1:30:06] timeline the next cast on the right hand
[1:30:08] side and we are in this seven Church
[1:30:10] ages and in every single age I think I
[1:30:13] think I I read the quote um last week
[1:30:16] it's where um it's I think it's the
[1:30:17] church age book uh and and the Lord and
[1:30:21] brother B is bringing out how that in
[1:30:23] each ch that Luther was the voice of God
[1:30:27] to the
[1:30:28] lutherans and Wesley was the voice of
[1:30:31] God he was the Living Word to the to the
[1:30:34] to the wesan
[1:30:35] movement and you are the last final
[1:30:37] voice to the final age so we have we
[1:30:39] have moved through these seven Church
[1:30:41] age and we are speaking the word we are
[1:30:43] casting the net out we are calling those
[1:30:46] for this church age but all the way
[1:30:48] through the bride you know there is
[1:30:51] there is these seven Church ages of fish
[1:30:53] that's been caught and all together they
[1:30:55] will make up this huge number of the
[1:30:57] Bride amen each
[1:30:59] one I'm going to come to a close
[1:31:01] musicians would you come I'm probably
[1:31:03] the shortest sermon we preach for a long
[1:31:04] time could the musicians come we'll just
[1:31:05] slowly close I want to read verse uh
[1:31:08] John 21 again please you know looking at
[1:31:11] our our commission what we have to do
[1:31:14] John 21 we're going to read verse three
[1:31:16] and
[1:31:18] 4 John
[1:31:22] 21 Simon Peter to saith unto them I go a
[1:31:26] fishing they say unto him we go also
[1:31:29] with thee they went forth and entered
[1:31:31] into a ship immediately and that night
[1:31:33] they caught nothing but when the morning
[1:31:36] was now come Jesus stood on the shore
[1:31:38] but his disciples knew not that it was
[1:31:40] him listen notice how they fished
[1:31:43] through the night see that they fished
[1:31:46] all through the night the Lord had it in
[1:31:48] such a way that that that these
[1:31:49] disciples were out on the boat and they
[1:31:51] were fishing through the night it was
[1:31:53] dark
[1:31:54] it was the Old Testament typing we we're
[1:31:57] typing it the Old Testament they were
[1:31:59] fishing in the wrong place the Gentiles
[1:32:02] had no chance in the Old Testament no
[1:32:05] chance there was no Grace for us but
[1:32:07] when the morning was come amen when the
[1:32:10] morning was come you know we're into
[1:32:11] this new day here look here so we can
[1:32:13] see here zoom in look here see this this
[1:32:15] this new this new day here into this new
[1:32:18] day okay and here is very this this
[1:32:21] point here is where the Lord Jesus is
[1:32:22] standing on the shore so we suddenly
[1:32:24] we're into this new dispensation we're
[1:32:26] into this new day and now suddenly we
[1:32:29] have Grace suddenly we can be
[1:32:33] caught there's a new day that's dawned
[1:32:36] it's the beginning of the Bride age it's
[1:32:38] the beginning of all these seven Church
[1:32:40] ages it's the beginning of the Lord
[1:32:42] calling his fish this Pro this this word
[1:32:45] something that goes together with the
[1:32:47] bread it goes and it's used remember
[1:32:50] it's used once specific it's for this
[1:32:54] spread the new day brought a change the
[1:32:58] net was suddenly cast on to the right
[1:33:01] side the Lord's good and finally the
[1:33:04] Gentile bride could be caught in this
[1:33:06] net of
[1:33:07] grace and the net it's been casting out
[1:33:10] now for 2,000 years so this whole this
[1:33:12] whole seeven uh uh seven seven seven um
[1:33:15] Church ages the seven Church ages is
[1:33:17] actually in in years it's it's 2,000 so
[1:33:20] from here from here to here it's
[1:33:22] actually 2,000 years so it spells out 2
[1:33:24] days we know we know the script I don't
[1:33:26] want to get into it but it's like it's
[1:33:27] like we get into it if you
[1:33:30] want okay this is 2,000 years this this
[1:33:33] this whole uh this whole
[1:33:35] um age here this is 2,000 years so this
[1:33:39] is uh here and then we've got here we've
[1:33:42] got
[1:33:44] uh what's this what am I doing is it uh
[1:33:47] this is uh wait 2,000 years right so I
[1:33:49] need to start back here so this is uh
[1:33:51] I'm working back 1 two three 4 okay so
[1:33:54] this is I've got I'm terrible at m one
[1:33:57] two I can I can always zero this is Adam
[1:33:59] and Eve A and E
[1:34:02] okay that's not good that means accident
[1:34:05] that's like your emergency room I think
[1:34:06] you call it in England A and E okay fine
[1:34:08] well that's where it all happened and
[1:34:09] that's when the first Band-Aid was put
[1:34:10] on so boom okay so this is uh 1,000
[1:34:15] years okay this is 2,000 years 2,000
[1:34:18] years this is 3,000 years this is 4,000
[1:34:22] years okay this is 5,000 years and this
[1:34:25] is 6,000 years okay so we're at the end
[1:34:28] of the sixth day and here in the here we
[1:34:30] have Noah's AR here okay Noah AR and
[1:34:34] there's Noah okay and here we have the
[1:34:36] cross in the middle we've got that
[1:34:37] already L yeah and we are right
[1:34:41] here so it says there in the prophecy in
[1:34:44] Joel it says in the last days I will
[1:34:46] pour out my spirit yeah okay and so for
[1:34:49] the young ones who kind of like you know
[1:34:51] a spirit the Holy Spirit is the life of
[1:34:54] God so we look in the scriptures and we
[1:34:57] can read and it says um it says he gave
[1:35:00] the ghost you know he gave the ghost I
[1:35:02] think maybe Anan and zapir for example
[1:35:04] fall at Peter's feet and give up the
[1:35:06] ghost so a ghost is a life right so it's
[1:35:10] like the Holy Ghost is the holy life
[1:35:12] it's it's God's Life Ghost spirit it's
[1:35:14] all the same thing so Holy Ghost holy
[1:35:16] spirit is God's own life okay so the
[1:35:19] prophet Joel um um Joel 2 we can read
[1:35:22] actually Joel 2 is it Joel 22 28 I think
[1:35:25] somebody might have to shout out and
[1:35:26] help me here where are
[1:35:28] we Joel where are
[1:35:31] we go find Joel
[1:35:35] out where are
[1:35:37] we
[1:35:39] Joel Joel 2 that's it Joel 2:28 that y
[1:35:44] says it and it shall come to pass
[1:35:46] afterwards that I will pour my spirit
[1:35:47] upon All Flesh and your sons and
[1:35:49] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:35:51] shall dream dreams and young men shall
[1:35:52] see visions and all also upon the
[1:35:54] servants and upon the handmaids in those
[1:35:56] days will I pour out my
[1:35:58] spirit and then we go to Acts 2 I just
[1:36:00] off the top of my head this hopefully is
[1:36:01] Right Acts 2 I'm sure it is oh Acts 2 if
[1:36:04] we
[1:36:05] could uh and it's Acts 2 Peter that's
[1:36:08] right in verse 14 see now now no longer
[1:36:11] Peter is uh fishing for uh Peter's not
[1:36:15] fishing for fish no more when we get to
[1:36:17] Acts 2 he ain't fishing for fish no more
[1:36:18] he's fishing for the fish fish okay so
[1:36:21] it says here in verse 14 but Peter
[1:36:23] standing up with the 11 have you got it
[1:36:26] yeah Peter standing up with the 11
[1:36:27] lifted up his voice and said unto ye men
[1:36:29] of Judea and all ye that dwell in
[1:36:31] Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[1:36:33] hearken to my words for these are not
[1:36:34] drunken as you suppose seeing is but the
[1:36:36] third hour of the day but this is that
[1:36:37] which was spoken of by the prophet Joel
[1:36:39] and then and then now he quotes in verse
[1:36:41] 17 what Joel said and it shall come to
[1:36:43] pass in the last
[1:36:45] days days last days sayith God I will
[1:36:49] pour out my spirit my spirit my life as
[1:36:51] we swap over into this new just ation
[1:36:54] I'm going to pour out my life and my
[1:36:57] life is going to fill the church okay my
[1:37:00] spirit upon All Flesh and your son and
[1:37:01] daughter should prophesy and young men
[1:37:02] should see visions and old men should
[1:37:03] Dre dreams right okay I've got a
[1:37:05] question for you so here when you get to
[1:37:08] number four between number four and
[1:37:09] number six right is that one day or two
[1:37:12] days there's a scripture that says uh
[1:37:14] you might have to help me now um be be
[1:37:17] be not be not deceived a days is a
[1:37:19] thousand years and a thousand years is a
[1:37:20] day which scripture is that I don't I
[1:37:23] w't read it you know it's the scripture
[1:37:24] it's telling us that a day in the eyes
[1:37:26] of the Lord is a thousand years so how
[1:37:29] many days have we gone past now oo we're
[1:37:31] at the end of the sixth day if we would
[1:37:33] zoom in on number six there right we are
[1:37:37] on day six we are about here it is the
[1:37:41] evening time it's later than you think
[1:37:44] it's gone past here if we would look at
[1:37:46] this as a day it's like if this is a
[1:37:47] clock okay a clock and it's hours okay
[1:37:50] then we've got 1 2 3 4 5 and this is
[1:37:52] 12:00 here midnight and we're like
[1:37:55] 11:58 we're right there right so that's
[1:37:59] at the end of the last day but here now
[1:38:02] we have got since the Lord began we've
[1:38:05] got six days but here it says that the
[1:38:07] spirit is not going to fall on All Flesh
[1:38:10] notice All Flesh not just on the smaller
[1:38:13] side of the sea but on the big side of
[1:38:15] the ocean on the right hand side my
[1:38:17] spirit is going to fall on All Flesh
[1:38:19] right in the last days and there's s on
[1:38:21] the end isn't there so it's not the last
[1:38:23] day it's the last days so if a thousand
[1:38:27] years is one day then we've got had six
[1:38:31] days right um is that right right so if
[1:38:34] it's days there has to be two days right
[1:38:38] so that's going to
[1:38:39] be days am I
[1:38:42] right is this right the last days so
[1:38:45] that is now at the point where the Lord
[1:38:47] where the dispensation changes over
[1:38:50] suddenly we're into the last
[1:38:52] days now notice it doesn't say day it
[1:38:55] says days so when the spirit of P fell
[1:38:58] on the day of Pentecost and the Lord
[1:39:00] suddenly indwell his bride in flesh this
[1:39:04] is the beginning of the calling in of
[1:39:06] the 50 153 fish this is the call this is
[1:39:09] the beginning of the casting out the net
[1:39:11] and pulling that net in this is the
[1:39:14] beginning of Christ notice he didn't
[1:39:16] pour out his Spirit on All Flesh
[1:39:18] before only in the New Testament only
[1:39:22] his bride
[1:39:26] the Net's been going out for 2,000 years
[1:39:28] now in my spirit I'll the last
[1:39:31] days but the Net's not going to break
[1:39:33] the Net's getting full but it's not
[1:39:35] going to break and our commission each
[1:39:38] one of us is to live this life of
[1:39:41] Christ and you know we're written
[1:39:43] Epistles we are written Epistles I just
[1:39:45] want to find this this this dollar note
[1:39:48] again whever it
[1:39:50] is I better find it cuz that's my ticket
[1:39:53] home
[1:39:55] I can't find it oh good there there we
[1:39:58] go right see we are written Epistles and
[1:40:00] on here this is a written epistle this
[1:40:04] is a written this is a written proof
[1:40:07] it's a written document and this is
[1:40:10] actually for real and if we weren't all
[1:40:12] bankrupt we could go and say I want
[1:40:14] Donald's $1 worth of gold and they would
[1:40:17] give it to you in theory so the point is
[1:40:20] this is a this is a written document
[1:40:22] this is a written an epistle and it's
[1:40:24] showing you that when I give this to
[1:40:27] you like this is going to cover your
[1:40:30] debt it's a written epistle and you know
[1:40:34] we've got a written
[1:40:36] epistle we have got a written epistle to
[1:40:39] show that this will cover your debt that
[1:40:42] this one has come to judge the world and
[1:40:44] this one will cover your debt we've also
[1:40:47] got this written epist we can also hold
[1:40:48] it up we can say this is legal tender
[1:40:51] this is legal tender and will cover your
[1:40:54] debt it will cover your debt public or
[1:40:58] private whatever you whatever we've done
[1:41:00] in public the Lord will cover it
[1:41:02] whatever we've done in private the Lord
[1:41:03] will cover it it's covered you know the
[1:41:06] Lord's good I I I just trust and I hope
[1:41:08] that my broken up message and thoughts
[1:41:10] everywhere and I just trust that we can
[1:41:13] just see something I was thrilled when I
[1:41:16] saw you know that the right hand side
[1:41:17] the left hand side what you can see what
[1:41:19] the Lord shows us in type form he's
[1:41:21] trying to get through to us what's going
[1:41:23] on on and Acts chapter 2 verse 14 now
[1:41:27] suddenly Peter's got no more questions
[1:41:30] suddenly he's not wanting to go fishing
[1:41:32] anymore I don't I haven't looked but I
[1:41:34] don't think he'll find him going fishing
[1:41:36] becoming a fishing no more no no no he's
[1:41:38] realized his commission he's realized
[1:41:40] what the Lord's called him to do he's
[1:41:41] the Penny's dropped he's going for it
[1:41:45] and the Lord he's he's he's he's called
[1:41:47] us he's lifted us up and now the Lord's
[1:41:50] cleaned us like justification
[1:41:52] sanctification he took us and he bought
[1:41:54] us with a price he paid the debt he's
[1:41:57] cleaned us up and he's using us for his
[1:41:59] glory to show forth the Praises of him
[1:42:02] as the scripture says you know the
[1:42:06] Lord
[1:42:08] after after the Lord
[1:42:11] um called them there was the there was
[1:42:14] the fish on the fire already suddenly
[1:42:16] the Lord commands them to feed his sheep
[1:42:21] to feed his lambs and the reason we see
[1:42:23] um Peter feeling so despondent is
[1:42:26] because oh Lord I love you yes sure yeah
[1:42:29] and then he remembers that he denied him
[1:42:31] once Saints don't ever let the devil
[1:42:35] tell you that you failed once before and
[1:42:37] that you can give up don't ever let the
[1:42:39] devil tell you that don't ever let the
[1:42:40] devil oh yeah yeah yeah oh do do you
[1:42:43] love oh Lord I love you I love you and
[1:42:45] then and then you kind of remember the
[1:42:46] time
[1:42:47] when you kind of just lost faith a
[1:42:50] little bit and the devil trust me he'll
[1:42:52] hone and say yes look at you you
[1:42:55] remember Sister colen when you were you
[1:42:58] know doubting a little bit see what I
[1:43:00] mean that's not the Lord first thing is
[1:43:03] to identify the Lord
[1:43:05] identified I'm just zooming on the class
[1:43:07] off C there and brother um uh don't tell
[1:43:11] me Chuck how can I forget Chuck I love
[1:43:13] Chuck it's like it's like you know the
[1:43:16] the the devil will honing on that and
[1:43:18] you see how the Lord he didn't call your
[1:43:20] Sinners no he didn't he just called them
[1:43:22] immature chran Christians he just
[1:43:24] identified where they were in their walk
[1:43:27] with the Lord and it's just like no no
[1:43:29] you're just a bit immature yet don't
[1:43:30] worry you'll get there you know and he
[1:43:32] calls I have you any me no you're doing
[1:43:33] the wrong thing cast it on the other
[1:43:34] side you know in our life you know
[1:43:36] sometimes we we we we get we feel down
[1:43:38] it doesn't take much for us it doesn't
[1:43:40] believe me it doesn't take much just a
[1:43:41] word just take somebody to just say
[1:43:43] something and that's it you're on the
[1:43:45] floor I'm going fishing you see and it's
[1:43:47] it's important that we recognize the
[1:43:49] spirits of sister Cen she'll she'll
[1:43:51] she'll she'll recognize the spirit on
[1:43:53] the choke and and she'll say oh honey I
[1:43:55] just feel so so upset and this and he'll
[1:43:57] say that's not the Lord like whoa you
[1:44:00] know you're immature Christians it's
[1:44:02] fine don't worry he's not telling you
[1:44:04] you're a sinner he's not he's just
[1:44:05] saying don't worry that's not the Lord
[1:44:07] identify he identified their condition
[1:44:10] and so it's important that we listen to
[1:44:12] our Brethren who the Lord is using to
[1:44:14] give us strength to strengthen one
[1:44:15] another that we listen and when they say
[1:44:17] you know don't worry it's it's it's it's
[1:44:20] it's not that's not the lord it's just
[1:44:21] the devil trying to bring you down
[1:44:22] happens to all the time even the kids
[1:44:24] the kids SCH ad that's not that's not
[1:44:25] the Lord what and she
