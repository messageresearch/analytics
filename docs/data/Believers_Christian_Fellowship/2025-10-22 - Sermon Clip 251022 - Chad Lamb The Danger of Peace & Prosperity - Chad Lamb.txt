========================================

God would use that failure in Peter because now Peter come back humble and repentant. And Peter was full of pride, self assured. Amen. He was so confident in himself and he was lifted up in pride and God would let him be sifted as wheat and fall flat on his face. And he didn't say, "I pray that you wouldn't be sifted. I pray that your faith would fail, not through your sifting." &gt;&gt; So what is it that you're going through? Do you say, "God, I mean, we go to God, God, do you know what's happening to me? What a foolish thing to say. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Or God, don't you see me? &gt;&gt; Another foolish thing to say. But it's exactly how we feel. We feel abandoned. We feel left alone. We feel like surely God would not permit this to happen to me. And the reality is the prophet of God told us there's nothing that happens in the life of a believer that doesn't first cross God's desk. &gt;&gt; He couldn't touch Jonah. Amen. without God's permission. He can't touch you without God's permission. He couldn't sift Peter without asking. &gt;&gt; And God a for Job for God for Job. Amen. He put limitations on what the devil could do. You can do this, but you can't do that. And then later he would ask again, "But you've got a hedge." He said, "But you can do this, but you can't do that." Amen. God knew exactly what was happening to Job. Job was confused. He had no understanding. He didn't know why. But God knew why. Because God was trying to answer his question and he was trying to accomplish his purpose. &gt;&gt; And that became a tremendous thing in Job's life and a tremendous thing for us. And it was a tremendous thing for Peter. &gt;&gt; And I look back over all my strains and stresses and troubles and cries to the Lord. And there's times that I literally prayed all night long because I had no answer and I was in the midst of a horrible trial and I didn't know what to do. And I prayed all night long. Listen, I never prayed all night long in my prosperity. &gt;&gt; I never got so close to God, so dependent on God. I never clutched his ankles and wrapped my arms around him and said, "I won't let you go." Like I did when I got that desperate. And I look back on that time in my life and God answered my prayer and he brought me through and he did a work in my life. And I'm thankful for that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good. &gt;&gt; God is good and he does good and he does what's right. And even the thing that doesn't feel good is good. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham's nervous tension didn't feel good. His sour stomach didn't feel good. His getting the blues didn't feel good. &gt;&gt; But it was important. Paul's thorn in the flesh didn't feel good. Whatever we go through certainly doesn't feel good and we don't call it good, but it works together for good. &gt;&gt; And if it works together for good, then in everything we can give thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen.
