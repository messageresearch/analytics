[0:00] he was he was saying amen uh you know
[0:04] unless you drink my blood
[0:06] and eat my flesh you have no life with
[0:08] me
[0:10] you know
[0:10] he didn't have to be mean
[0:13] the statement itself was going to bring
[0:15] a separation
[0:17] he was preaching the truth amen of
[0:20] spiritual communion of partaking of
[0:22] christ he said lest you drink my blood
[0:24] and eat my flesh you have no life with
[0:25] me and many of his disciples said this
[0:27] is a hard saying who can hear it amen
[0:29] and many walked away and then they they
[0:31] go to ask him you know it's a hard
[0:33] saying and he says well if you don't
[0:35] like that what about if you shall see
[0:37] the son of man
[0:39] return into heaven where he came from
[0:42] and the rest walked away
[0:45] what was he separating by not by his
[0:47] attitude
[0:50] not by his hardness or his harshness he
[0:52] was separating by the revelation of the
[0:55] word he was dropping the revelation of
[0:57] the word and they couldn't handle the
[0:58] word for their day
[1:00] they couldn't handle the fresh
[1:01] revelation of the word amen it was
[1:03] confusing to them it didn't sound right
[1:06] it actually sounded wrong to drink blood
[1:08] and eat flesh and you as a human being
[1:11] come down from heaven it didn't sound
[1:13] right it was it didn't make sense to
[1:15] their understanding it didn't sound like
[1:17] what they had been been hearing in their
[1:19] traditional understanding amen and he
[1:21] brought the word amen in such a way it
[1:24] brought a separation
[1:26] amen and the message has come to bring
[1:28] us back to the true revelation of the
[1:30] word for our day and the message brings
[1:32] separation
[1:35] not with an arrogant attitude not with a
[1:38] hateful speech or a hard delivery it
[1:40] brings you can whisper the true
[1:42] revelation and it'll bring a separation
[1:46] amen
[1:48] because what was god doing
[1:50] he was separating
[1:52] the wheat
[1:53] from the husk
[1:56] he had 70 that had went two by two
[1:59] preaching the gospel and now they walked
[2:00] away and he turns to peter and to the
[2:03] disciples he said well you go also
[2:08] he is this is not the gathering time for
[2:11] jesus's ministry this is the time that
[2:13] he's blowing chaff away
[2:16] separating out the multitude separating
[2:19] out the 70 turning to the closest
[2:22] friends as closest companions as helping
[2:25] the ministry to the disciples and he
[2:27] said will you go also
[2:30] and peter says to whom shall we go thou
[2:32] alone have the words
[2:34] they had no place else to go they didn't
[2:36] have an explanation for what he said
[2:38] they didn't have an understanding or
[2:39] comprehension of what they said what
[2:41] they had was a c gene on the inside that
[2:44] could say there's no place else to go
[2:46] this is truth amen this is right i may
[2:48] not understand it i can't explain it i
[2:50] don't know why everybody's leaving but
[2:52] this is the truth amen and what was he
[2:54] doing he was using the revelation of the
[2:56] word to separate the chaff from the
[2:59] wheat
