[0:00] what does the rainbow represent the
[0:01] covenant
[0:02] so here is the one that represents the
[0:04] covenant is sitting on the throne
[0:09] but but wasn't that one just in the
[0:11] church ages
[0:14] he was in the church ages but now john
[0:16] is is caught up in a place and he's
[0:18] looking at the one what
[0:21] but you're on the throne but i just saw
[0:22] you in the church ages
[0:24] what changed
[0:28] he was looking
[0:29] at
[0:30] one
[0:31] context
[0:33] he's looking at one picture that god
[0:36] gave him
[0:38] now there was an invitation
[0:40] john
[0:41] come up
[0:42] higher yes lord
[0:45] immediately he's caught up
[0:46] and his context is now completely
[0:50] different
[0:53] he's not
[0:55] looking at the church ages anymore
[1:00] he's looking at the one that is on the
[1:02] throne
[1:04] it is a different
[1:06] context
[1:09] he was called up to a higher place
[1:12] see he's here and his context changes
[1:15] brother why do you keep saying context
[1:17] because we want to emphasize this point
[1:20] because remember it is the contradiction
[1:23] that we struggle with
[1:24] it seems that these two things are in
[1:27] direct contradiction but god never
[1:29] contradicts himself
[1:31] john is still the same person that he
[1:33] was five minutes ago
[1:35] he's still the same one but his context
[1:38] is now different the perspective of who
[1:42] jesus christ is is different than it was
[1:45] five minutes ago
[1:47] though john is the same person though
[1:50] john is the same son of god he is now
[1:53] looking at jesus christ in a different
[1:55] light
[1:57] he was looking at jesus christ in the
[1:59] midst of the context of time but he is
[2:02] no longer amen
[2:04] [Music]
[2:06] he's now seeing an eternal god sitting
[2:08] on the throne all we can go through well
[2:10] brother brother nathanael his body's not
[2:12] eternal that's right he was born in a
[2:15] natural condition but the one that is
[2:17] sitting on the throne is eternal
[2:20] he is the eternal god that was there
[2:22] from before we can perceive of it
[2:25] the self-existing one and he has
[2:27] represented himself to us in a way that
[2:30] we can catch it
[2:32] he was in a context that we could not
[2:34] relate to he was an eternal god he was
[2:37] self-existing he came down on sinai and
[2:40] they were afraid of him
[2:44] he presented himself in that context but
[2:47] when the time came to present himself
[2:49] differently he changed the vision so
[2:52] that the one seeing the vision could see
[2:54] him in the proper light
[2:59] the perspective
[3:01] changed
[3:02] it's the same god
[3:05] it's the same jesus christ
[3:08] john is here on the isle of patmos in
[3:10] this context
[3:12] the church ages haven't even taken place
[3:15] yet
[3:16] and he is already seeing beyond
