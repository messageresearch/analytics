[3:08] and just
[3:09] want to let you know brother manuel sent
[3:10] me a text and said he and his family

[3:14] kentucky again and he and his family are
[3:16] there this weekend so if you'll be
[3:18] praying for them as the minister and
[3:20] traveling
[3:21] back today
[3:23] i want to thank everybody who came out
[3:25] yesterday for the memorial service for
[3:26] brother john it was a nice turnout we
[3:28] had a nice time and i appreciate
[3:30] everybody coming and i appreciate all
[3:32] those who helped with the meal and
[3:34] helped clean up and preparation and all
[3:36] that it was wonderful to be able to just
[3:38] gather around sister nancy and her
[3:39] family and show them that we love them
[3:41] and support them
[3:43] and
[3:44] you know as brother ben said don't
[3:45] forget the mcnulty family they just lost
[3:48] sister lou and so we want to remember
[3:50] them in prayer and as soon as we get
[3:52] funeral details we'll get that out to
[3:54] you all
[3:55] i also ask that you'll be remembering me
[3:57] and the family in prayer and a few of us
[3:59] we're going over to levi yoder's
[4:02] to have a service this evening and serve
[4:04] communion so if you remember just to
[4:06] keep us in prayer here at the end of the
[4:08] service we'll be taking off immediately
[4:11] amen are you happy to be in the service
[4:13] today
[4:14] isn't it wonderful to know that there's
[4:16] brothers and sisters who believe like
[4:18] you
[4:19] and when we gather together like this we
[4:21] can sing
[4:22] because we have the same father amen we
[4:24] have the same husband and there's a
[4:25] camaraderie that comes not because we go
[4:28] to the same building
[4:31] as the camaraderie comes because we come
[4:33] from the same source
[4:36] and we're going back to the place we
[4:38] came from and it unites us in a way
[4:40] nothing else could unite us
[4:42] no no geography no building no system no
[4:46] there's nothing else no interest in life
[4:48] there's nothing else that can bind us
[4:51] like the eternal binding that has bound
[4:53] us from eternity to eternity
[4:55] and we've dropped down here and what
[4:57] brother ben said this little hickey of
[4:58] time this little depression out of the
[5:00] circle of eternity to accomplish
[5:02] something to display something but we're
[5:04] going right back in to that circle of
[5:06] eternity and we've come from there we
[5:09] were together we're together we'll be
[5:11] together amen and i thank god for that
[5:14] amen
[5:15] so we appreciate you all this morning
[5:17] let's look here at revelation chapter 12
[5:22] and we're going to
[5:24] begin
[5:25] at verse 7.
[5:29] and there was war in heaven
[5:31] michael and his angels fought against
[5:34] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[5:36] angels and prevailed not neither was
[5:38] their place found anymore in heaven
[5:40] and the great dragon was cast out that
[5:42] old serpent called the devil and satan
[5:45] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[5:47] cast out into the earth and his angels
[5:49] were cast out with him and i heard a
[5:51] loud voice saying in heaven now has come
[5:53] salvation and strength in the kingdom of
[5:56] our god and the power of his christ for
[5:59] the accuser of our brethren is cast down
[6:01] which accused them before our god day
[6:03] and night
[6:05] and they overcame him by the blood of
[6:07] the lamb and by the word of their
[6:08] testimony and they love not their lives
[6:11] unto death
[6:13] therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[6:15] dwell in them woe into the inhabiters of
[6:18] the earth and of the sea for the devil
[6:20] has come down unto you having great
[6:22] wrath because he knoweth that he hath
[6:24] but a short time
[6:26] may may god ask the god we ask god to
[6:28] ask the blessing and bless the reading
[6:30] of his word praise god sit down
[6:33] if we're starting off this rough who
[6:35] knows what service is going to be like
[6:39] lord help us
[6:40] we have not come to hear an eloquent
[6:42] speaker
[6:43] we've come to hear the word of god amen
[6:46] that is evident amen you have to forgive
[6:48] me we had a busy day yesterday with the
[6:51] the
[6:52] funeral we had the funeral preparations
[6:54] and we had to minister to the funeral
[6:55] and the dinner afterwards and then i had
[6:57] to prepare for the preaching tonight
[6:58] when we go over to uh brother levi's and
[7:01] then i started on the service for this
[7:03] morning getting my notes together and uh
[7:06] i got really tired about 1 or 1 30 in
[7:08] the morning i thought i'll lay down and
[7:09] wake up early and and you know just go
[7:12] back on my notes again and i woke up and
[7:14] me and my wife were freezing
[7:16] because we had run out of propane
[7:19] and so
[7:21] i thought praise god anyhow
[7:24] amen but thank god we have a wood
[7:26] furnace we're doing fine and we'll be
[7:28] all right but it's always something and
[7:31] so i was thinking we ran around trying
[7:32] to get check the furnace do this find
[7:34] out what's going on make a call and did
[7:36] all that stuff so i come to church and
[7:38] say lord i'm depending on you
[7:41] but i'm expecting that god will speak to
[7:43] us as he always does amen so we're
[7:46] thankful for that we just trust the lord
[7:48] and we're thankful that no matter what
[7:49] happens when you start to see things uh
[7:52] i don't know if it's just as we have
[7:54] more experiences with god or how this
[7:56] goes and we grow in maturity you start
[7:58] to see things like this and you just hit
[8:00] them in stride and you say hey praise
[8:02] god anyhow the devil cannot stop the
[8:04] word of god he cannot stop the call of
[8:06] god in my life no troubles come those
[8:09] things are disappointments or
[8:11] distractions it cannot stop what god has
[8:13] purposed before the foundation of the
[8:15] world this too will work out for his
[8:17] glory
[8:20] amen and i realized i didn't even need
[8:22] to worry about it because we're on
[8:23] automatic fill and i guess the propane
[8:26] company got behind cause i called this
[8:27] morning and they said oh you're on the
[8:29] list to be filled today i thought sunday
[8:32] who feels on sunday
[8:35] but god already had to take care of i
[8:36] didn't even need to make the call i
[8:37] should have just kept
[8:38] doing what i was doing
[8:40] but god is good anyhow friends so it's
[8:43] good to be with you this morning
[8:44] i'd like to take a a subject this
[8:47] morning and talk about uh just um
[8:50] a statement out of
[8:51] verse 11. so let's read verse 11 again
[8:54] and they overcame him by the blood of
[8:56] the lamb and by the word of their
[8:58] testimony and they love not their lives
[9:01] to death and i want to look at this
[9:03] victory by testimony because it's
[9:06] interesting the way this is worded we
[9:07] know that in this passage of scripture
[9:10] amen that that satan is overcome he's
[9:13] he's completely defeated and cast out of
[9:15] heaven and cast into the earth and we'll
[9:17] get to a quote in a minute where brother
[9:19] benham tells us that when the bride goes
[9:20] up he comes down so this is uh this is
[9:23] in direct correlation to the victory of
[9:26] the bride and the translation of the
[9:28] bride and satan coming down and so but
[9:32] it says here is the way that they
[9:34] overcame they overcame him by the blood
[9:37] of the lamb and by the word of their
[9:39] testimony
[9:41] and you know the blood of the lamb is
[9:43] something that god had provided for us
[9:45] when we had we had nothing to do with
[9:47] that god had did it himself he decided
[9:50] to come in a flesh a body that he called
[9:52] the son of god and we know him as jesus
[9:54] christ and god came and lived the
[9:56] perfect life the sacrificial life he
[9:59] became the lamb he died as the lamb of
[10:02] god he shed that perfect blind that
[10:04] redeemed us back to god that washes us
[10:06] from our sins that cleanses us from all
[10:08] perfection he did that for us with no
[10:11] input or help from us
[10:14] so we overcome by that
[10:17] and
[10:19] by the word of our testimony
[10:22] so we we have to realize that god has
[10:25] already done his part
[10:27] god did it faithfully and it was enough
[10:29] god has finished he's done his part but
[10:32] now there's a part in this overcoming
[10:34] when i overcome satan and overcome the
[10:36] devil i overcome by what god did but
[10:39] also by the word of our testimony that's
[10:41] what the scripture's saying here
[10:44] brother branham says in the message god
[10:46] hiding himself in simplicity he said but
[10:48] when he crossed he separated his sonship
[10:51] he's a sinner by nature he's under the
[10:53] hands and dominion of satan and god took
[10:55] a sacrifice a chemical blood and put the
[10:58] blood of bulls and goats and but the
[11:00] blood of bulls and ghosts did not
[11:01] divorce sin it only covered sin
[11:04] if i've got a red spot on my hand and
[11:06] covered with white the red spot's still
[11:08] there see it's still there but god sent
[11:10] down from heaven a bleach for sin
[11:12] it was the blood of his son
[11:14] that when our confessed sin drops into
[11:16] god's bleach try to bring it again the
[11:19] coloring of sin goes back through the
[11:21] mediators and down through time until it
[11:24] hits the accuser satan and lays on him
[11:26] till the day of judgment
[11:29] praise be to god
[11:31] and so the the sin
[11:33] uh the the
[11:35] the cure for sin has already been given
[11:37] in the blood that was shed amen and that
[11:40] blood that was shed was to free us from
[11:42] sin
[11:43] but
[11:44] when when brother bam says it this way
[11:46] when our confess sin
[11:48] amen when we confess our sin and confess
[11:52] the blood of jesus christ amen that sin
[11:55] amen drops off of us and goes down
[11:57] through and goes back to the accuser the
[12:00] originator of sin and lays on him till
[12:02] the day of judgment
[12:05] so we have to confess our sins there's a
[12:07] part that we must do also
[12:09] when we look at this in in revelations
[12:12] 11
[12:13] uh i want to look at this word testimony
[12:15] where it says they overcame him by the
[12:17] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[12:18] their testimony
[12:20] this word testimony is mature
[12:25] i believe is how you say it in the greek
[12:28] and it's translated witness 15 times
[12:30] testimony 14 times record seven times or
[12:33] report once
[12:35] and the definition they say what one
[12:37] testifies testimony for example before a
[12:41] judge
[12:42] so this is not
[12:43] uh this testimony if you could take it
[12:46] this way is this testimony is like an
[12:49] official report let's say it that way
[12:51] like a testimony before a judge amen
[12:54] it's it's an official report so it's not
[12:57] just a a whimsical statement it's not
[12:59] just something that i just said but when
[13:02] you overcome by your testimony this
[13:04] testimony is your witness amen your
[13:07] witness of the word your witness of the
[13:09] of the day and age that you live in it
[13:12] is an official report it is an official
[13:14] testimony it is an official declaration
[13:17] and we overcome him by the blood of the
[13:20] lamb and by this testimony or by this
[13:23] witness
[13:25] amen
[13:26] so we want to understand that
[13:30] that this is a witness or a
[13:32] testimony brother brahms says in 1959
[13:36] and the message what hearst thou elijah
[13:38] by the blood of the lamb and their
[13:40] testimony they overcame is that right
[13:43] you overcome by the blood of the lamb
[13:45] and by your testimony if we can just
[13:48] have faith and believe in the lord god
[13:50] that he will do these things for us
[13:55] he says here in the first seal this is
[13:57] the quote that i referred to later
[13:58] referring to this scripture out of
[14:00] revelation 12 it says but in revelation
[14:02] 12 7-9 satan the spirit the devil which
[14:05] is up there now accuser of our brethren
[14:08] all right the church is taken up and
[14:11] satan is cast out when the church goes
[14:13] up satan comes down then satan
[14:16] incarnates himself in the antichrist and
[14:18] is called the beast
[14:20] so he's up there now as the accuser of
[14:23] our brethren so if if you would with me
[14:26] i'd like for us to just think of this
[14:28] like like a courtroom setting and you
[14:31] know brother branham preached the trial
[14:33] a trial trial a court trial he preached
[14:36] this message several times in 1964 and
[14:38] i'm going to refer to many many quotes
[14:41] from one of those messages but if you
[14:43] just think of this that before god amen
[14:46] there's an accuser of the brethren
[14:47] making accusation amen but these
[14:50] brethren that he's accusing are
[14:52] overcoming the accuser or the prosecutor
[14:55] of you they're overcoming by the blood
[14:58] of the lamb and their own witness their
[15:00] own testimony they are standing and
[15:03] testifying against the accusations of
[15:06] the devil they are not bowing and
[15:08] cowering to the accusations of the devil
[15:11] but they're testifying a testimony
[15:13] against what he's saying
[15:15] they say you know but you know they they
[15:18] did this and and they did that and and
[15:20] look at how they acted the other day and
[15:23] look at how they they spoke to their
[15:24] children look how they spoke to their
[15:26] spouse amen but there's got to be
[15:28] somebody that stands up with the
[15:29] testimony and says but his blood has
[15:31] covered all of my sins
[15:34] and i believe that by his spirit he's
[15:37] changing me he has washed me and he's
[15:39] changing me and i have repented for that
[15:41] god has convicted me and repented and
[15:43] that no longer lays to my charge your
[15:45] accusation is false
[15:48] because they overcome him by the blood
[15:50] of the lamb and the word of their
[15:52] testimony we have got to be able to take
[15:54] this word and fight back the accusations
[15:57] of the accuser with this word of god
[16:00] that we believe
[16:03] so he's the accuser of the brethren
[16:06] and the accuser of the brethren is there
[16:09] making accusation
[16:11] until a certain time
[16:13] in this certain time when the bride has
[16:16] finished her testimony her witness upon
[16:19] this earth and the last member comes in
[16:22] and she has witnessed of this truth and
[16:25] then she will be brought up and when she
[16:27] goes up he comes down the accuser of the
[16:29] brethren has left because he can no
[16:32] longer accuse them because their witness
[16:34] was true and their witness was witnessed
[16:36] by the translation and he can no longer
[16:39] accuse them any longer so he's cast down
[16:41] to the earth
[16:43] but they overcome them
[16:46] they overcome him
[16:47] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[16:49] their testimony
[16:50] let's go to john chapter 14.
[17:10] see there's an accuser of the brethren
[17:14] and the worst thing you can do in your
[17:16] in your life is to agree with him
[17:20] he stands there day and night accusing
[17:22] the brethren and the very worst thing
[17:25] that you could ever do is agree with him
[17:27] and testify of his testimony
[17:30] the worst thing you'll ever do in your
[17:32] life amen is say what the when the
[17:35] prosecutor says that that you're you
[17:37] know it doesn't work for you and and
[17:39] you're not a real believer and and and
[17:42] god's blessing everybody else with you
[17:44] the worst thing you can do is stand in
[17:47] the seat of a witness when the
[17:48] prosecutor's laying that charge and you
[17:50] start repeating back the same thing the
[17:52] prosecutor says
[17:55] amen where's our overcoming where's our
[17:58] victory if we repeat what the accuser of
[18:00] the brethren is accusing then we're
[18:02] never going to be able to overcome him
[18:04] but we must overcome him by the blood of
[18:06] the lamb and the word of our witness our
[18:09] testimony
[18:11] we cannot repeat back what he's saying
[18:14] regardless of what it is amen and
[18:16] regardless of how we feel we must come
[18:19] to faith in that word and rebuke all
[18:21] that accusation by the word of god
[18:24] now in john chapter 15
[18:27] verse 26
[18:29] he says but when the comforter is come
[18:31] whom i will send unto you from the
[18:33] father even the spirit of truth which
[18:35] proceedeth from the father he shall
[18:37] testify of me
[18:39] and ye also shall bear witness because
[18:42] you have been with me from the beginning
[18:46] i want you to look at this scripture
[18:48] and see that these
[18:51] disciples that he's sending out
[18:53] these disciples
[18:55] they will receive the comforter
[18:58] which jesus said i will send to you
[19:02] which earlier jesus said i will pray to
[19:04] the father that he'll send to you
[19:06] so who sent the comforter
[19:10] if you keep reading in john you're going
[19:11] to find out they're all the same thing
[19:13] jesus said i'll pray to the father that
[19:15] he'll send to you another comforter and
[19:18] now now jesus says when the comforters
[19:20] come whom i will send to you from the
[19:24] father
[19:25] and then he says the comforter is the
[19:27] spirit of truth and that he will come to
[19:29] you and the spirit of truth is the holy
[19:31] ghost and then jesus said and i will
[19:33] come to you
[19:35] so who's coming to you is it the spirit
[19:37] of the truth is it the comforter is it
[19:39] the holy ghost did it come from jesus or
[19:41] did it come from the father
[19:43] [Music]
[19:45] so this spirit of truth this comforter
[19:48] this holy spirit he
[19:51] he i will send you from the father even
[19:53] the spirit of truth which proceedeth
[19:55] from the father he shall testify of me
[19:58] because the spirit of truth is the
[20:00] spirit of god is the spirit of the word
[20:03] is the life of the word is the spirit of
[20:05] the truth he can never testify anything
[20:08] but the truth
[20:10] the truth is the only thing that he can
[20:12] testify so you can never get the holy
[20:14] ghost to give a false testimony of the
[20:17] word of god the holy ghost will only
[20:19] give a true witness because he is sent
[20:21] to be the true witness and the true
[20:23] witness was sent to you to dwell in you
[20:26] so that with the holy ghost then you can
[20:28] have a true witness so the true witness
[20:31] comes to you to give you a true witness
[20:36] but then he says the holy ghost will
[20:38] testify of me
[20:40] and you also shall bear witness
[20:43] because and that bear witness is the
[20:45] same word as testify
[20:47] you shall bear witness because you have
[20:50] been with me from the beginning
[20:53] i'm going to ask you a question this
[20:54] scripture here in john 15 27
[20:57] if if jesus is referring to the
[21:00] beginning of his life
[21:03] none of these
[21:04] disciples he's talking about it doesn't
[21:06] count
[21:07] if he's talking about the beginning of
[21:09] his ministry it'll count for most of
[21:11] them
[21:12] but as his ministry went along he picked
[21:14] up a few more disciples
[21:16] so the question is is he speaking of the
[21:18] beginning of his earthly life is he
[21:20] beginning you know was it the beginning
[21:22] of his ministry when he was baptized
[21:24] because you know andrew found him then
[21:25] and then quickly after peter then a few
[21:27] others in the then he come along in his
[21:28] ministry and gathered some more
[21:31] so if so
[21:33] then that scripture only applies to 11
[21:36] people
[21:39] is that right
[21:41] but how many of you believe that the
[21:42] scripture applies to you
[21:45] then what makes you
[21:47] a witness or able to bear witness is
[21:49] because you have been with him from the
[21:52] beginning when the logos came out of the
[21:55] father you were there amen when when
[21:58] that expression of the thought of god
[22:00] came out in word form as the logos you
[22:02] were there and because you were there
[22:04] amen that gives you the ability to bear
[22:07] witness because you were with him from
[22:08] the beginning
[22:11] and because you were with me from the
[22:12] beginning you were put on this earth
[22:14] amen to be a witness because the devil
[22:17] will be overcame but he will be overcame
[22:20] and cast out of heaven when the
[22:23] believers overcome by the blood of the
[22:25] lamb and the word of their testimony so
[22:28] the overcoming of the accuser and the
[22:30] casting down of the accuser is dependent
[22:32] on you and i having a true witness
[22:37] how many want satan to be cast down
[22:41] look let's go back if we can really
[22:44] quickly let's go back to
[22:46] to revelation chapter 12.
[23:01] i want to read this again
[23:05] i started verse 7 again and there was
[23:07] war in heaven michael and his angels
[23:09] fought against the dragon and the dragon
[23:10] fought and his angels and prevailed not
[23:13] neither was their place found anymore in
[23:15] heaven and the great dragon was cast out
[23:17] that old serpent called the devil and
[23:19] satan which deceiveth the whole world he
[23:22] was cast out into the earth and his
[23:24] angels were cast out with him so we see
[23:27] here that he has deceived the whole
[23:29] world
[23:30] but he hasn't deceived me because i'm
[23:32] not part of the world i'm not of the
[23:34] world i come from another father i come
[23:36] from another place jesus says i'm born
[23:39] from above you're from below
[23:42] so he's deceived the whole world but he
[23:43] hasn't deceived the children of god
[23:47] all right he deceived the whole world he
[23:48] was cast out into the earth and his
[23:50] angels were cast out with them and i
[23:52] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[23:54] has come salvation and strength and the
[23:56] kingdom of our god and the power of his
[23:58] christ for the accuser of our brethren
[24:00] is cast down which accused him before
[24:02] our god day and night
[24:04] and they overcame him by the blood of
[24:06] the lamb and by the word of their
[24:08] testimony and they love not their lives
[24:11] unto death
[24:13] therefore
[24:14] rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in
[24:17] them
[24:18] this is what heaven has been waiting for
[24:22] there's a rejoicing amen that is the
[24:25] heaven is being reserved for a certain
[24:27] rejoicing and they will rejoice amen
[24:30] when the accuser of the brethren is cast
[24:32] down when michael has the final victory
[24:34] and the accuser of the brother is cast
[24:36] out and those that have been accused
[24:37] have overcome him by the blood of the
[24:39] lamb and the word of the testimony when
[24:41] the bride goes up he goes down they've
[24:43] overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[24:45] the word of their testimony amen and now
[24:49] rejoice the heavens and ye that dwell in
[24:51] them and woe into the inhabitants of the
[24:53] earth and of the sea for the devil has
[24:55] come down but heaven now is rejoicing
[24:59] why heaven is rejoicing because the last
[25:02] part of christ the last one of his part
[25:05] of his body amen has come to full
[25:07] maturity and has stood the witness in
[25:09] the face of satan's eden and is standing
[25:12] as a true witness giving a true witness
[25:14] have overcome by the blood of the lamb
[25:16] and the word of their testimony and that
[25:18] has caused amen that final victory of
[25:21] the the bride at the end time has caused
[25:24] the translation the casting down and now
[25:27] heaven is free from that spirit
[25:31] and now there's rejoicing in heaven
[25:34] why because there had to be somebody to
[25:36] give a witness
[25:38] somebody to give a testimony
[25:42] let's look at colossians chapter 1.
[25:50] colossians chapter 1
[25:51] verse 26.
[26:01] colossians 1
[26:02] verse 25
[26:04] where if i am made a minister according
[26:06] to the dispensation of god which is
[26:08] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[26:10] of god
[26:11] even the mystery which has been hid from
[26:13] ages and from generations but now is
[26:15] made manifest to his saints to whom god
[26:18] would make known what is the riches of
[26:20] the glory of this mystery among the
[26:22] gentiles which is christ in you
[26:24] the hope of glory
[26:27] so there is a hope for glory
[26:29] and that hope is christ in you so that
[26:32] you can become the witness to stand
[26:34] against the accuser of the brethren
[26:37] and that hope is in you let's go to acts
[26:39] chapter 1.
[26:49] acts chapter 1.
[26:54] and verse 6.
[27:03] acts chapter 1 verse 6 and when they
[27:05] were therefore were come together they
[27:07] asked of him saying lord will thou at
[27:09] this time restore again the kingdom to
[27:11] israel and he said unto them it is not
[27:13] for you to know the times or the seasons
[27:16] which the father hath put in his own
[27:17] power
[27:19] but you shall receive power after that
[27:21] the holy ghost has come upon you and you
[27:23] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[27:25] jerusalem and all judea and in samaria
[27:28] and to the uttermost part of the earth
[27:32] jesus is telling the people and telling
[27:34] the disciples that you shall receive
[27:36] power after the holy ghost but what was
[27:39] that power to do they were to receive
[27:42] the the power that would change their
[27:44] nature that would change their life and
[27:46] they would receive the true witness that
[27:48] testifieth of the truth amen so that
[27:50] they could be witnesses so the so god
[27:53] was giving them the spirit of truth the
[27:56] power so that they could give a true
[27:58] witness
[27:59] because god wanted them to be witnesses
[28:02] and we see all the way over and
[28:04] revelation chapter 12 how important
[28:06] their witness their testimony the word
[28:08] witness and testimony is the same how
[28:10] they're using their witness and their
[28:12] testimony to overcome the devil so he
[28:14] sends the spirit of god upon him the
[28:16] spirit of truth so that they can be
[28:18] witnesses of him amen and as they're
[28:20] witnesses of him amen they're overcoming
[28:22] the devil
[28:24] so he gave them the holy ghost so that
[28:26] they could be witnesses of him unto the
[28:29] uttermost part of the earth that shows
[28:32] that that promise was not just for them
[28:34] they weren't the only ones to be the
[28:36] witness because they start in jerusalem
[28:38] they go to judea and to samaria and to
[28:40] the uttermost parts of the earth and hey
[28:43] we're still going to the uttermost parts
[28:45] of the earth because the holy ghost has
[28:46] come to make us witnesses of him
[28:50] and that is how we overcome
[28:53] brother branham said in 1958 in the
[28:54] message have faith in god it was on the
[28:56] day of pentecost when 150 jews were in
[28:59] an upper room with the door closed
[29:01] waiting for the promise cowardly afraid
[29:03] to testify the door shut because of the
[29:06] threat of the jews it was after the
[29:08] resurrection christ had come in the form
[29:10] of the holy spirit and had given them an
[29:12] experience and licking tongues of fire
[29:15] set upon them it was then they could run
[29:17] out into the streets and and peter could
[29:19] say ye men of israel and ye that dwell
[29:21] in judea let this be known unto you and
[29:24] hearken to my words it was after he had
[29:26] had the experience of receiving the holy
[29:28] spirit that he could testify fearless
[29:30] and seal his testimony with his own
[29:32] blood crucified with his head turned
[29:35] down after he had an experience
[29:38] so after that experience it gave peter
[29:40] boldness amen to be able to go and
[29:43] testify of what he believed before that
[29:45] the brother and i said timid and
[29:47] cowardly amen but after the baptism the
[29:49] holy ghost the power came to him the
[29:52] true witness came to him amen and peter
[29:55] had the revelation of the word for his
[29:57] day and he ran out so convinced the
[30:00] first thing he does is when he runs out
[30:01] into the public he stands there and he
[30:03] begins to proclaim to them the word of
[30:06] god that was taking place in their day
[30:09] he begins to say this is that that joel
[30:11] prophesied this is prophecy fulfilled
[30:13] amen he started preaching modern events
[30:15] made clear by prophecy that was that the
[30:18] holy ghost gave him power to do it gave
[30:20] him power to proclaim the manifestation
[30:22] that he was in currently he was no
[30:24] longer afraid he was no longer uncertain
[30:27] he was no longer questioning amen he had
[30:30] backslidden he had he had he had gone
[30:32] back on christ because he was protecting
[30:35] his own life but when we go to
[30:37] revelations chapter 12 they overcame by
[30:39] the word of their testimony by the blood
[30:41] of the lamb and the word of their
[30:43] testimony because they love not their
[30:45] lives unto death
[30:47] and that's what peter received when he
[30:49] ran out that day it was no longer peter
[30:51] protecting peter now peter would get
[30:53] arrested he would he would stand before
[30:55] the the sanhedrin and before the council
[30:57] and the elders and they would tell him
[30:59] don't do this and they would threaten
[31:00] him and they would threaten with abuse
[31:02] and threaten with imprisonment and he
[31:04] would say hey is it far better to listen
[31:06] to man or to listen to god you tell me
[31:09] something had changed he was so
[31:11] convinced when he received the power of
[31:13] the true witness amen it unlocked the
[31:16] power of the word in him and he went out
[31:18] to testify of the days and the age that
[31:20] he lived
[31:23] when he received the holy ghost he
[31:25] didn't go out and preach a previous age
[31:28] gospel
[31:31] when he received the holy ghost he
[31:33] preached present tense gospel
[31:42] and it wasn't
[31:44] just words
[31:46] but he had the life on the inside
[31:49] he had the experience of receiving the
[31:51] life of christ and now he could go and
[31:53] be a a witness he could testify of
[31:55] christ
[31:57] and then in the message investments from
[31:59] 1963 the prophet of god says the life
[32:02] that is in you shows what you are
[32:05] your life testifies so loud in you until
[32:08] your toast testimony is not heard
[32:11] just think about that
[32:13] your testimony is your witness your
[32:16] witness in this world is not always
[32:18] words
[32:20] now i believe it comes with words and
[32:21] many times it needs words but the
[32:23] expression the witness or your testimony
[32:25] in this life is not always just words
[32:27] your life is a witness of christ in this
[32:30] day
[32:33] so i read that again the life that's in
[32:35] you shows what you are your life
[32:37] testifies so loud
[32:39] in you until your testimony is not heard
[32:44] they know what you are by the life that
[32:46] you live in the things that you do if
[32:48] the life of christ is in you then
[32:49] therefore the works and life of christ
[32:51] you live because that's his life living
[32:54] through you you're just in a vessel to
[32:57] carry on the work of god
[33:00] so we're here to be a witness and we're
[33:02] here to witness this present tense truth
[33:05] and the power of the holy ghost has come
[33:08] to change us from our old life and give
[33:10] us the life of christ that will quicken
[33:13] to us the word for our day the message
[33:16] of the hour and we will go out and not
[33:18] testify of previous day truths but we
[33:21] will go out and testify of present tense
[33:23] truth and our testimony will not be
[33:26] words only but power and demonstration
[33:29] of the gospel it will be a life lived
[33:31] it'll be the word fleshed out what peter
[33:34] and the disciples had is they had
[33:37] the revelation of the word for their day
[33:39] but they had the life that proved that
[33:41] the life of christ was inside of them
[33:44] it was both amen the testimony was their
[33:46] life and the word that they preached
[33:51] now i want to spend a little time
[33:53] if you
[33:54] uh be patient with me i want to spend a
[33:56] lot a little time in the in a message
[33:58] i'm going to read several quotes out of
[33:59] a message titled a court trial from 1964
[34:03] this one was preached april 12 1964
[34:06] and i want to i want to go through these
[34:08] things these quotes and there's quite a
[34:09] few of them but look at how brother
[34:11] branham was teaching this in a trial
[34:13] brother branham had already preached the
[34:15] indictment amen before he comes to this
[34:17] point so after an indictment then you
[34:19] have a trial you know so it's just
[34:21] interesting that he's now in the trial
[34:23] but in this trial that he's talking
[34:25] about here it's the devil who's trying
[34:27] to accuse god
[34:30] the devil's trying to accuse god of not
[34:32] keeping his word and not all of his word
[34:34] being true and so brother venom sets a
[34:36] drama he makes the church the courtroom
[34:38] amen and he and he starts down this path
[34:40] but i want to look at what he says here
[34:43] and in paragraph 56 he says and the
[34:45] prosecuting attorney also has some
[34:47] witnesses in the case
[34:49] and i'm going to name them and one of
[34:51] them is mr unbeliever
[34:54] and the next one is mr skeptic and the
[34:56] next one is mr impatient these are the
[34:58] one that is trying to get judgment
[35:00] against god
[35:02] now we have all the characters called in
[35:04] now and we're in court so we're going to
[35:06] call the court to order all right the
[35:08] order is the court is called to order
[35:11] and the prosecuting attorney is now
[35:13] going to call his first witness to give
[35:16] witness and his first witness to the
[35:17] stand is mr unbeliever
[35:20] and his complaint is that god's word of
[35:22] promise is not altogether true
[35:25] that's what his complaint is the first
[35:27] witness says he claims that he is a
[35:28] believer though he isn't but he claims
[35:31] he is and he claims that he was
[35:33] attending here some time ago a holy
[35:36] ghost so-called meeting where the people
[35:38] were laying hands upon the people and
[35:40] giving their scriptural rights to do
[35:41] this reading it out of mark 16 where
[35:44] i've just read they shall lay hands upon
[35:46] the sick and they shall recover
[35:48] mr unbeliever testifies and he says that
[35:51] i had the hands of this what was called
[35:53] the holy ghost-filled preacher lay his
[35:55] hands upon me according to mark 16 the
[35:58] promise that god made and the man said
[36:00] he was a believer and many claimed to be
[36:03] healed and he laid his hands upon me and
[36:05] that's been two months ago and nothing's
[36:07] happened therefore the promise is not
[36:09] true all right we asked mr unbeliever to
[36:12] step down so brother graham's doing it
[36:14] as a case the prosecuting attorney he
[36:15] asked his first witness his first
[36:17] witness was mr unbeliever mr unbeliever
[36:20] brother ram title is he mr unbeliever
[36:22] but that's not what mr unbeliever would
[36:24] have went by
[36:25] because he saw he called himself a
[36:26] believer he thought he was a church
[36:28] member and a believer
[36:30] he was
[36:31] an unbeliever posing as a believer
[36:36] i'd say this way
[36:37] that can still be possible
[36:41] that is still possible that that there
[36:44] are unbelievers posing as believers
[36:48] and
[36:49] he thinks that he's a believer
[36:51] and he thinks that there was something
[36:54] untrue in the word of god because god
[36:56] made a claim in his word and i did what
[36:58] god said i had him lay hands on me and
[37:00] it didn't work there is something where
[37:03] there's something wrong with the word of
[37:05] god and it's just amazing to me how
[37:07] brash the the devil can be sometimes
[37:10] amen when he brings accusations because
[37:13] because he's claiming that there's
[37:15] something wrong with the word of god
[37:19] and he never listen the the devil didn't
[37:22] come this mr unbeliever i should say it
[37:24] this way this this unbelieving believer
[37:31] this unbelieving believer
[37:34] has the audacity
[37:36] under a deception accused god of not
[37:39] keeping his word that there's a problem
[37:41] with god's word and never the common
[37:44] sense to say that maybe there's
[37:46] something wrong with me
[37:49] but lays the accusation to the word of
[37:51] god
[37:53] then next it goes on down i'm just
[37:54] skipping through i'm just gonna i've
[37:56] pulled little uh excerpts out of this
[37:58] message so next witness stands up is mr
[38:01] skeptic
[38:02] now he testifies he said i went to a
[38:04] church he was sick and i went to a
[38:06] church that was supposed to have a godly
[38:08] pastor in and that had faith in god's
[38:10] word and had a little crucifix sitting
[38:13] upon his on his desk and all of his
[38:15] people that came in there that wanted to
[38:17] be prayed for he anointed them with oral
[38:19] reading the promise out of god's word in
[38:21] james 5 14. he read the word and said if
[38:24] there be any sick among you let them
[38:25] call the elders of the church let them
[38:27] anoint them in oil and pray over them
[38:29] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[38:31] sick and god shall raise him up if they
[38:33] did any sin it shall be forgiven him now
[38:35] and he said i had as this pastor who had
[38:38] heard testimonies from others anoint me
[38:40] with oil reading the scriptures to me
[38:42] out of god's promise and that has been
[38:44] over a month ago and i'm still just as
[38:46] sick as i was when he anointed me
[38:48] therefore that's his complaint let mr
[38:51] skeptic step down
[38:54] and the prosecuting attorney satan calls
[38:56] his next witness his next witness is mr
[38:59] impatient
[39:00] that's that's a rascal
[39:03] look at this
[39:04] that's a rascal i want to tell you today
[39:06] that mr impatient is still a rascal
[39:12] excuse that expression he just makes you
[39:15] get you so nervous you don't know what
[39:17] you're doing
[39:19] mr impatient he claims that one day
[39:21] while reading the bible
[39:23] all these all these claim to be
[39:25] believers now now think about it mr
[39:27] unbeliever mr skeptic and mr impatient
[39:30] they all claim to be believers
[39:36] they claim to be believers now and they
[39:38] he claims that he was reading the bible
[39:40] and he come across the passage in mark
[39:42] 11 22 and 23 where jesus himself made
[39:45] the promise that if you say to this
[39:47] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[39:48] your heart but believe that what you
[39:50] said will come to pass you can have what
[39:53] you have said
[39:54] and again he said if you when you pray
[39:56] and believe that you receive what you
[39:57] asked for now he says i've been a
[40:00] in my feet laying in my feet for
[40:02] some 30 years and i accepted that
[40:05] promise five years ago and nothing has
[40:07] happened since i'm still just as
[40:09] crippled as i ever was now see then he
[40:13] steps down
[40:14] so we've had our three witnesses on the
[40:16] prosecutor's side the prosecutor of
[40:18] satan and the three witnesses are
[40:21] mr unbeliever mr skeptic mr
[40:24] impatient so i really want i'm not mean
[40:27] to add to the message but i really want
[40:29] to bring clarity to this as brother
[40:30] benham said we have mr unbelieving
[40:32] believer
[40:34] mr skeptical
[40:36] believer and mr impatient believer
[40:40] because they all claim to believers
[40:41] they're all part of the church
[40:46] see
[40:47] we're not
[40:48] we're not in the place i don't believe
[40:50] we're in the place right now
[40:52] where the devil he knows his tactics and
[40:55] he's wise
[40:57] he's not ignorant he just didn't wake up
[41:00] this morning and decide that he wanted
[41:02] to try to defeat the children of god he
[41:04] has been working a plan for for the from
[41:06] the beginning he's been working a plan
[41:09] from before the garden of eden
[41:13] and so he's wise and so he comes in
[41:17] the devil comes in in the church he
[41:20] comes in in your thinking he comes in
[41:23] and uses scriptures
[41:27] the devil is so deceptive and we talked
[41:29] about this a little while back when we
[41:31] were talking about the temptation of
[41:33] jesus christ and we were seeing how
[41:36] deceptive the devil is that he comes as
[41:38] an angel of life he comes as a believer
[41:42] or he comes with the word and he's
[41:44] trying to cause you to either unbelieve
[41:47] or be skeptical or be impatient and he
[41:50] uses the word to try to get you to do
[41:51] that
[41:52] the devil is trying to get you to be the
[41:54] unbelieving believer he's trying to get
[41:56] you to be the skeptical believer he's
[41:58] trying to get you to be the impatient
[42:00] believer
[42:02] and he's going to use circumstances he's
[42:05] going to use scriptures and in this day
[42:06] and age we live in the devil will use
[42:08] quotes
[42:11] it's amazing that the devil will use the
[42:14] very thing that is to give us strength
[42:16] which is the word of god and the very
[42:17] thing to give us overcoming power over
[42:20] him and he will use the very thing that
[42:23] god has sent to help us overcome him and
[42:25] he will use it to overcome us
[42:29] it is spiritual judo
[42:33] where you use your opponent's strength
[42:35] against him and our strength is the
[42:37] revealed word of god
[42:40] so the devil will try to use that and
[42:42] try to work as an angel of light
[42:45] seemingly good and try to rob us of our
[42:48] faith and disrupt us and destroy our
[42:51] testimony because it's our testimony
[42:53] that's going to destroy him
[43:00] so brother bam goes on to say we're in
[43:01] the same message court trial we will be
[43:03] i think for the rest of the service
[43:05] he says therefore he is indicting god
[43:08] trying to get a case against him
[43:10] to say that god has put something in his
[43:13] word for his believing children and does
[43:15] not stand behind what he promised
[43:18] now i want you to look at this the real
[43:20] contest that's going on here is a
[43:22] contest between satan and the word of
[43:24] god this is the real contest the contest
[43:28] that's going on all around us is a
[43:30] contest between satan and the word of
[43:32] god he is trying to discredit the word
[43:34] he's trying to destroy the word he is
[43:35] trying to defeat the word amen and so
[43:38] satan he he the whole battle is over the
[43:42] word of god so satan will bring his
[43:44] witnesses to witness against the word of
[43:46] god amen but brother brahms is going to
[43:48] bring us a defense witness on the scene
[43:50] here in a minute and the defense witness
[43:52] is the holy ghost that was sent to
[43:53] testify of christ
[43:56] and the defense witness also has witness
[43:58] says the defense witness will testify
[44:00] himself but he also has witnesses that
[44:02] will testify too because the court case
[44:05] is over whether or not the word of god
[44:08] is true or not and satan has always been
[44:10] trying to discredit god's word amen but
[44:13] there's going to be witnesses that
[44:14] witness against that word but i'm here
[44:16] to say there will be witnesses that will
[44:18] be a true witness with a true testimony
[44:20] that'll stand with the defense witness
[44:22] and say no you're wrong mr unbeliever
[44:25] this word is the truth amen you're wrong
[44:27] mr skeptic this word is the truth you're
[44:30] wrong mr impatient this word is the
[44:32] truth
[44:35] i believe our brother bernie sanders can
[44:37] stand on that day and say mr impatient
[44:38] you're wrong
[44:42] amen
[44:44] many others can stand on that day and
[44:46] say mr impatient you're wrong
[44:49] i remember the testimony of sister viola
[44:51] yingst and sister viola yanks you know
[44:53] she she went through the prayer line on
[44:55] her 40th birthday
[44:57] in july i believe in 1963 in the message
[45:00] i think if i i i might have it wrong but
[45:02] i think it's he cares do you care
[45:04] and if you listen to that tape the first
[45:06] person through the prayer line is sister
[45:08] viola ying she had prayer card number
[45:09] one on her 40th birthday
[45:13] and she goes through the prayer line and
[45:15] there's several things amen that was
[45:17] going on in the life and brother ben
[45:18] begins to discern i see you have a
[45:20] thyroid condition i see a doctor and
[45:22] you've got spiritual troubles you don't
[45:23] know whether you're in you don't know
[45:24] whether you're out and that was because
[45:25] she was just coming to the message and
[45:26] the rest of her family wasn't seeing it
[45:28] yet and she was on thyroid medication
[45:30] and he says i see you holding your head
[45:32] i may not be quoting this exactly right
[45:34] but but
[45:35] you understand
[45:37] you've got bad headaches
[45:38] and sister viola told me that brother
[45:41] ben prayed for her and she left she said
[45:43] instantly she quit taking her thyroid
[45:45] medicine and had no more problems with
[45:46] her thyroid that moment
[45:49] and then uh her and brother ed got a
[45:52] revelation of the message together and
[45:54] and the family come to the message
[45:56] together and the spiritual trouble
[45:57] settled out
[45:58] but she said she had to wait multiple
[46:01] years
[46:02] before she was finally delivered of
[46:04] migraine headaches
[46:06] and some of the family here might
[46:07] remember i don't remember but it was
[46:08] years and years and years it was a long
[46:10] time
[46:12] and it was the same sister coming before
[46:14] the same prophet
[46:15] believing the same word and having the
[46:17] same prayer
[46:18] one is healed instantly one is he uh one
[46:22] comes one deliverance comes shortly
[46:23] thereafter and one she has to wait for
[46:26] multiple years before it's fulfilled i
[46:28] say sister viola yinks is going to be
[46:30] able to stand on that day and say mr
[46:31] impatient you're wrong
[46:34] you're wrong abraham's going to be able
[46:36] to stand and say mr impatient you're
[46:38] wrong 25 years i waited but god was true
[46:41] to his word amen mr impatient you're
[46:43] wrong sister viola can say mr impatient
[46:45] you're wrong brother bernie can say mr
[46:48] impatient you're wrong
[46:50] brother bernie got a terrible case of
[46:52] shingles that left him with nerve damage
[46:54] and he had pain for years amen he prayed
[46:57] believed god was anointed with oil and
[46:59] stood by his confession and after five
[47:01] years god removes it
[47:04] in a moment with no explanation it's not
[47:06] explainable how it went away even the
[47:08] doctor told brother bernie that it
[47:09] doesn't that doesn't see any way that
[47:11] you'll be healed you'll probably live
[47:13] this way
[47:14] because these things there's no there
[47:15] was no healing that the doctors could
[47:16] give for that
[47:20] what do you say brother bernie is mr
[47:22] impatient wrong he's wrong
[47:25] he's a liar
[47:28] praise be to god
[47:31] these
[47:32] this mr impatient whispers in your ear
[47:36] this mr skeptic comes in worship
[47:38] whispers in your ear this mr unbeliever
[47:41] comes and worships in your ear trying to
[47:43] get you to deviate off the word of god
[47:46] and lose confidence
[47:48] and brother brahm says going on with the
[47:50] case
[47:52] he's trying to get a case against him
[47:54] he's indicting god trying to get a case
[47:56] against him to say that god has put
[47:58] something in his word for his believing
[47:59] children and does not stand by behind
[48:02] what he promised
[48:03] also he claims that he is unfair to make
[48:06] such promises to people to his believing
[48:08] children and is not able to back up what
[48:10] he said he would do
[48:13] now the prosecuting attorney is showing
[48:14] a hard case here against the defendant
[48:17] he's not able to back it up because he's
[48:19] got witnesses here he does not stand
[48:21] behind the word that he promised yet the
[48:23] prosecuting attorney speaks on
[48:26] the prosecuting attorney says which is
[48:28] satan
[48:29] yet god promised that all these things
[48:32] are possible to believers god says that
[48:34] in his word the prosecuting attorney is
[48:37] sealing up his case now you see he
[48:39] thinks he's got it because the three
[48:41] witnesses that give witness and give it
[48:43] to the scripture and has quoted the
[48:45] scripture right and everything the way
[48:47] that they've done it
[48:49] the devil the the the prosecuting
[48:51] attorney he thinks he's got his case
[48:52] sealed up he's got three witnesses
[48:54] they've all quoted the word of god all
[48:56] showing that the word of god failed
[49:00] but then the prophet of god goes on to
[49:02] say
[49:03] now we'll call the defense witness
[49:06] the holy spirit
[49:09] oh
[49:11] he was sent to testify to be a witness
[49:14] of christ
[49:15] but he was not sent to do it alone
[49:18] you're to testify with him
[49:22] if
[49:23] brother frank if you don't mind to bring
[49:24] up the whiteboard
[49:26] i want to i want to look together let's
[49:28] go back to genesis chapter
[49:31] 3.
[49:38] let's go to genesis chapter 3.
[49:50] verse 1
[49:51] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[49:53] beast of the field which the lord god
[49:55] had made
[49:56] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[49:58] said you shall not eat of every tree of
[50:01] the garden
[50:03] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[50:05] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[50:07] garden but of the fruit
[50:09] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[50:10] garden god has said you shall not eat of
[50:12] him neither shall you touch it lest you
[50:15] die
[50:16] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[50:18] shall not surely die for god does know
[50:20] that in the day you eat thereof then
[50:22] your eyes shall be open and you shall be
[50:25] as gods knowing good and evil
[50:28] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[50:29] good for food and that it was pleasant
[50:31] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[50:33] make one wise she took of the fruit
[50:35] thereof and did eat and gave also into
[50:37] her husband with her and he did he and
[50:40] the eyes of them both were open and they
[50:41] knew that they were naked and they sowed
[50:43] fig leaves together and made themselves
[50:45] aprons
[50:47] i want to look at this serpent speaking
[50:49] to
[50:51] eve now
[50:52] to the woman
[50:54] in the temptation
[50:57] i'm going to say eve so we know who
[50:59] we're talking about we know that her
[51:00] name was not eve at this time her name
[51:01] was woman she was named eve after
[51:04] adultery
[51:06] so she has a name of adultery or a name
[51:08] of a blasphemy she has a blasphemous
[51:11] name
[51:13] because the churches take names after
[51:15] they leave the word
[51:17] so eve is now going to be deceived
[51:21] and the serpent
[51:23] comes along
[51:28] and the serpent is going to play the
[51:29] role
[51:31] sorry
[51:32] that's an arrow
[51:36] of mr unbeliever
[51:42] all right
[51:42] he's first going to play the role of mr
[51:44] unbeliever
[51:46] and he begins to say
[51:47] you you shall not surely die
[51:51] he he's taking the word of god that was
[51:53] a direct comment a direct commandment
[51:56] from the lord and he begins to sow a
[51:58] little doubt about the the exact wording
[52:02] of the
[52:03] an exact meaning of the scripture and
[52:06] he's just sowing a little bit of doubt
[52:07] he comes in a mr believer and says you
[52:09] shall not surely die i mean god's not
[52:12] really going to kill you you're not
[52:13] really going to die and he begins to
[52:16] start with a little doubt in the mind of
[52:19] eve
[52:20] and then he comes down here
[52:25] as mr skeptic
[52:31] and he begins
[52:33] to make her question
[52:34] why
[52:36] god would do such a thing like that and
[52:38] he says for ver
[52:40] let's just read this together let's go
[52:42] over here to
[52:43] verse 4
[52:44] and the servant said unto the woman ye
[52:46] shall not surely die
[52:49] for god doth know that in the day you
[52:50] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[52:52] and you shall be as gods knowing good
[52:54] and evil
[52:56] now all of a sudden
[52:57] mr
[52:58] skeptic he he begins to say you know
[53:03] uh
[53:04] god's keeping something from you there's
[53:06] more to this story i mean god knows that
[53:09] if you eat that your eyes will be open
[53:10] and you'll becomes his gods knowing good
[53:12] and evil so mr skeptic he brings a
[53:14] little skeptical something about the
[53:16] word now god's holding something back
[53:19] there's a little more truth here there's
[53:20] a little more something to this you're
[53:22] not getting the whole picture you're not
[53:24] getting the whole story amen there's
[53:26] something god's holding something back
[53:28] from you
[53:32] and then he comes
[53:33] as mr impatient
[53:39] and brother branham said he fell because
[53:41] she just couldn't wait
[53:44] she just couldn't wait god had a plan
[53:47] for her and god would have revealed this
[53:49] plan to the man and to the woman if they
[53:52] would have just waited they would have
[53:53] got god's perfect will on what to do but
[53:56] she was impatient she just wouldn't wait
[53:59] so he comes to the serpent comes now who
[54:02] is the serpent amen the serpent was not
[54:06] was not known to them as the devil the
[54:07] serpent was not the devil the serpent
[54:10] was a friend
[54:12] and the devil came into the serpent to
[54:15] deceive them amen but the serpent was
[54:18] not the devil the serpent was part of
[54:21] their church
[54:24] the serpent was part of their church the
[54:27] serpent believed god
[54:30] he believed in god i should say it that
[54:32] way he didn't believe god or he wouldn't
[54:34] have said what he said but the serpent
[54:35] believed in god amen the serpent was
[54:38] part of their church the serpent amen
[54:41] looked almost like a child of god but
[54:43] wasn't a child of god
[54:46] the serpent was something that was
[54:47] similar to a child of god without being
[54:50] a child of god and the serpent even had
[54:52] a place for a soul without having a soul
[54:54] so he was even built very similar to a
[54:57] child of god and looked almost like a
[54:59] child of god
[55:02] but was not a child of god
[55:04] the serpent could speak like a child of
[55:07] god
[55:09] the serpent could hear the word like a
[55:11] child of god and speak like a child of
[55:14] god and talk about god and worship god
[55:17] and speak of god's word but the serpent
[55:20] could never be a child of god
[55:24] so what did the devil use what what
[55:26] vessel did the devil use to bring this
[55:29] deception he brought a friend he brought
[55:33] part of the church of the garden
[55:36] was the name of the church the garden
[55:38] church
[55:39] they were in the garden of eden
[55:41] the first church of the garden of eden
[55:46] and in the first church of the garden of
[55:48] eden there was a member in that church
[55:50] that had a place our soul without a soul
[55:52] was like a child of god but wasn't a
[55:54] child of god and that's where the devil
[55:56] came in for deception and incarnated
[55:58] that vessel began to work through
[56:00] somebody that that the woman was
[56:02] familiar with than what a woman had
[56:04] maybe probably worshipped with the one
[56:07] that that talked about god maybe this
[56:09] wasn't the first time the serpent and
[56:12] the woman had a conversation about god
[56:17] but he begins to he begins to sow a
[56:20] little doubt about the commandment and
[56:22] he begins to sow a little doubt about
[56:24] one part of the commandment amen yes
[56:28] it's true yes god said that but you'll
[56:30] not surely die and there that seed of
[56:33] unbelief drops in and she begins to
[56:36] disbelieve one small part of the word of
[56:38] god she never stopped believing in god
[56:40] she never stopped believing this was a
[56:42] commandment of god
[56:44] just one little part
[56:47] and then he starts to show a little
[56:48] skepticism in her mind and say you know
[56:51] god knows more than you and god's trying
[56:54] to keep this from you because god knows
[56:57] that if you take this then your eyes
[56:59] will be open and you'll be like gods and
[57:01] god doesn't want you to have that
[57:05] and there's a little skepticism that's
[57:07] sewn in and what was eve living under
[57:10] she was living under the message of her
[57:11] day
[57:13] she had the word for that day she had
[57:15] the message of the hour for that day and
[57:18] the devil was coming attacking the
[57:20] message
[57:22] with a little bit of doubt about the
[57:24] message and a little bit of doubt uh a
[57:28] little bit of skepticism about you know
[57:30] really i mean god there's there's
[57:32] something more to this uh
[57:34] a little bit of skepticism about you
[57:36] know is that really right that seems a
[57:38] little bit strange
[57:42] and then a little bit of impatience you
[57:44] know you know it's already been how many
[57:46] years eve how many years have it been
[57:48] since god gave that commandment
[57:52] you see we're in the garden friends
[57:57] we've been given the message of the hour
[57:59] we've been given the word amen we've
[58:01] been united with our bridegroom again
[58:03] we've been put back together and given
[58:05] the full word of god just like eve had
[58:07] the full word of god for her day we've
[58:09] been given the full word of god for our
[58:10] day
[58:13] but don't think that the devil has
[58:15] stopped all of his tricks he has not
[58:17] he's not gone on vacation he's not gone
[58:19] into early retirement he is still here
[58:21] doing what he's always done
[58:24] we have to understand him and all of his
[58:26] tactics
[58:27] so the serpent
[58:30] i'm going to put over here
[58:35] oh man
[58:37] i don't know how to get rid of that i'm
[58:38] not smart enough
[58:41] i'll work on it some other time
[58:44] the serpent was a church member
[58:47] part of the church
[58:50] part of the first church of the garden
[58:54] so
[58:56] uh
[59:00] i want to look at something else here
[59:02] in just a second let's let me finish
[59:04] this quote
[59:05] now we will call the defense witness the
[59:06] holy spirit you know if there's a
[59:08] defendant there has to be a defense
[59:10] witness so we'll call the defense
[59:12] witness to defend the defendant the holy
[59:14] spirit
[59:15] the first thing that the holy spirit
[59:16] says when he steps up is this he wants
[59:19] to call the attention to the prosecutor
[59:22] that the one that's trying trying to try
[59:24] the case that's indicted the prosecutor
[59:27] has misinterpreted the word to the
[59:29] people
[59:31] just like he did to the first human
[59:34] being eve in the garden of eden he has
[59:36] misinterpreted the word to the people
[59:38] and the holy spirit the defense witness
[59:40] calls the attention to this
[59:43] notice he said the prosecutor has said
[59:46] that these promises are to the
[59:48] he says the prosecutor has said that
[59:50] these promises are to the believers and
[59:53] that believers is the only thing that
[59:55] the promise is to
[59:57] not to unbelievers and skeptics
[1:00:00] the defense witness claims that god
[1:00:02] distinctly said that it was to the
[1:00:04] believers and calls the attention that
[1:00:06] each one that testified in protest
[1:00:09] against the word admitted that others
[1:00:11] claimed to be healed
[1:00:13] so the first thing to dispense witness
[1:00:15] when he gets up the holy ghost which he
[1:00:16] says he he says
[1:00:18] i want to bring attention to one thing
[1:00:21] that everything the prosecutor claimed
[1:00:24] all the scriptures that he used and all
[1:00:26] the scriptures that he claimed the
[1:00:28] promises of god that didn't work i want
[1:00:30] to make note of something for the court
[1:00:32] that those promises are only to
[1:00:35] believers
[1:00:37] all right that's just for the when the
[1:00:39] defense witness comes the holy ghost
[1:00:41] comes on the scene that's the first
[1:00:42] thing he wants to make clear amen you
[1:00:44] may say the word didn't work i tried it
[1:00:46] a thousand times i waited 20 years but
[1:00:49] the holy ghost the first thing he wants
[1:00:50] to establish this truth is that these
[1:00:53] scriptures only work for the believers
[1:00:56] they're only promised to the believers
[1:00:58] amen and it's not my fault if it didn't
[1:01:01] work in your life amen and because this
[1:01:04] promise came to the believers and i'm a
[1:01:06] believer and i'll never throw away my
[1:01:08] promise because of your testimony
[1:01:11] you may be a believer who's under
[1:01:12] deception and you'll get corrected and
[1:01:14] everything will be fine i'm not saying
[1:01:15] you're not a believer but i'm saying
[1:01:17] your testimony will never throw me off
[1:01:19] because these promises by the witness of
[1:01:21] the holy ghost are only to god's
[1:01:23] believing children
[1:01:26] and just because you have something to
[1:01:28] say against it amen doesn't change any
[1:01:31] of the effect of the word of god in my
[1:01:33] life
[1:01:34] just because you testify amen there's so
[1:01:38] many people now that have left the
[1:01:39] message and they leave the message then
[1:01:42] they go online and they start a youtube
[1:01:44] channel and they want to give the world
[1:01:46] their testimony of why i left the
[1:01:48] message and what the message did to me
[1:01:51] and and i just want to say amen on in
[1:01:53] his defense standing amen in the witness
[1:01:56] booth this morning that this message
[1:01:58] only came for the bride of jesus christ
[1:02:01] it only came for the bride of jesus
[1:02:03] christ amen it did not come if you're
[1:02:06] not bride this message was not for you
[1:02:10] amen and what's funny about this this is
[1:02:13] what this is just what i find
[1:02:14] interesting
[1:02:16] is now you have individuals who are
[1:02:18] willing to leave the truth of god
[1:02:21] because it didn't work for them they
[1:02:23] there was things that went wrong there
[1:02:25] was difficulties there was uh uh maybe
[1:02:27] even wrong things that happened
[1:02:29] ministers that had done wrong and things
[1:02:31] that they had believed incorrectly or
[1:02:32] were taught incorrectly or whatever
[1:02:34] happened sin in their life whatever
[1:02:37] reason they leave they're willing now to
[1:02:39] take the stand before hundreds or even
[1:02:42] thousands of people to testify against
[1:02:44] the word but when they were believing
[1:02:46] the message they never took the stand
[1:02:48] where's the youtube video that says this
[1:02:51] is why i believe the message
[1:02:58] but we're willing to take a public stand
[1:03:00] against the word
[1:03:03] the bride won't take a stand against the
[1:03:05] word
[1:03:07] this message came for the bride of jesus
[1:03:09] christ this message came to call out a
[1:03:11] bride to equip a bride to mature a bride
[1:03:15] amen and to bring a bride to the full
[1:03:17] the full potential of the word for this
[1:03:20] day
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:27] so
[1:03:28] the first thing that the defense witness
[1:03:30] wants to establish
[1:03:32] is that the word of promise is only
[1:03:35] promised to the children of god
[1:03:37] first thing
[1:03:39] he says again
[1:03:41] calling the intention now the prosecutor
[1:03:43] has misquoted the word
[1:03:46] and god never said that they would jump
[1:03:48] up right quick as soon as they had hands
[1:03:50] laid on them but he said they that
[1:03:53] believe would recover that is if he
[1:03:56] believes it's only to believers
[1:04:01] and again the defense witness wants to
[1:04:03] call the attention to the court this
[1:04:05] afternoon that god said that his word
[1:04:07] was a seed
[1:04:09] the word is a seed that a sower sowed if
[1:04:11] this soil seed falls into the right kind
[1:04:13] of soil that's got enough fertility in
[1:04:16] it to make the seed spring to life
[1:04:18] quicken it it'll live
[1:04:23] now i i just want to look at this mr
[1:04:26] unbeliever mr skeptic and mr impatient
[1:04:29] just for a minute
[1:04:31] and look at it down through history
[1:04:34] i'm not going to take a lot of time on
[1:04:36] this
[1:04:37] but just quickly
[1:04:44] because i believe that all the things
[1:04:45] that were written before for our
[1:04:47] examples
[1:04:50] mr unbeliever
[1:04:52] is here to bring doubt upon the word of
[1:04:54] god
[1:04:56] but sometimes
[1:04:58] he doesn't make you
[1:05:00] it doesn't not
[1:05:02] but not
[1:05:06] make you
[1:05:09] doubt the word
[1:05:14] sometimes he just makes you
[1:05:18] doubt the word
[1:05:21] is for you
[1:05:28] this is the greatest deception
[1:05:30] of mr unbeliever
[1:05:32] because you think if mr unbeliever is
[1:05:34] whispering in your ear he's going to get
[1:05:36] you to deny that the message is true
[1:05:39] to get you deny
[1:05:41] that that this word the scripture is not
[1:05:43] true that there is no god that there is
[1:05:45] no bride that there is no redemption or
[1:05:47] no attorney or that that would be mr
[1:05:50] unbeliever but sometimes mr unbeliever
[1:05:52] he comes in so deceptive he doesn't want
[1:05:54] you to doubt any of that
[1:05:57] he doesn't want you to doubt that the
[1:05:58] message is true he doesn't want you to
[1:06:00] doubt that brother branham was a true
[1:06:02] prophet of god he doesn't want you to
[1:06:03] doubt that all the scriptures are being
[1:06:05] fulfilled in our day he doesn't want you
[1:06:06] to doubt that god has called a bride and
[1:06:08] that there's been an invisible union and
[1:06:10] that the bride is being caught up word
[1:06:12] by word he doesn't want you to doubt any
[1:06:14] of that all that mr believer wants you
[1:06:16] to do is doubt that it's for you
[1:06:19] if he can get you to believe that
[1:06:21] healing's for somebody else and that
[1:06:22] deliverance is for somebody else and
[1:06:24] that this message is for somebody else
[1:06:26] and there's a bride out there but i
[1:06:28] don't know if i'm the bride if mr
[1:06:30] unbeliever can get you that far he has
[1:06:32] already won that's all the victory that
[1:06:34] he needs he doesn't need you in fact i
[1:06:37] don't believe mr unbeliever wants you to
[1:06:40] make a full denunciation of everything
[1:06:42] because you're more valuable as a tool
[1:06:43] of deception if you remain saying i
[1:06:46] believe this and i believe that and it's
[1:06:48] all the truth but it just doesn't work
[1:06:50] for me i just can't seem to overcome
[1:06:52] because your negative testimony of the
[1:06:54] word amen will bring more unbelief and
[1:06:57] doubt that if it didn't work for this
[1:06:59] sister then maybe it won't work for me
[1:07:03] so mr unbeliever is not necessarily
[1:07:05] trying to get you to denounce the whole
[1:07:07] program of god and go running away and
[1:07:10] call it all a lie he might be just
[1:07:12] trying to get you to deny that this word
[1:07:15] is for me and look at what he did to
[1:07:17] sarah amen before sarah was changed
[1:07:20] their promise came to abraham that
[1:07:22] you're going to have a son and sarah
[1:07:24] believed that
[1:07:26] promise but then sarah began to doubt
[1:07:29] that that promise was for her
[1:07:32] and she began to say take hagar my
[1:07:36] handmaid and this is how we'll get seed
[1:07:39] she wasn't disbelieving the word she was
[1:07:42] disbelieving the word for her
[1:07:46] she was disbelieving that she could be
[1:07:48] changed that she could conceive seed
[1:07:50] that she could bring forth a child that
[1:07:52] she could nurse the child she was
[1:07:54] looking at all of her physical
[1:07:55] conditions and she was doubting she was
[1:07:58] not doubting the promise she was
[1:08:00] doubting the promise for her
[1:08:03] and when she doubted the promise for her
[1:08:05] this is how deceptive the devil is when
[1:08:07] she doubted the promise for her she
[1:08:09] created through her doubt a hybrid
[1:08:12] product and that hybrid product became
[1:08:14] the persecutor of the church for the
[1:08:17] rest of their days and is still the
[1:08:19] persecutor of the jews
[1:08:22] so what did her doubt do her doubt
[1:08:25] produced amen uh their doubt produced a
[1:08:28] byproduct a hybrid product and that
[1:08:31] hybrid product became the persecutor of
[1:08:34] the true genuine product
[1:08:37] that's exactly what he produced
[1:08:41] right
[1:08:42] to doubt the word of god not leave the
[1:08:45] church not leave the message amen but
[1:08:48] just doubt that it works for you and
[1:08:50] come up with another way to have victory
[1:08:53] come up with another way to overcome
[1:08:55] come up with another way to make the
[1:08:57] word work amen bringing a hybrid product
[1:09:00] and that hybrid product will be the
[1:09:02] persecutor of the true
[1:09:06] amen
[1:09:08] so
[1:09:09] he made
[1:09:12] sarah doubt
[1:09:14] that it was for her
[1:09:18] she didn't doubt it to be true she
[1:09:19] didn't doubt that god spoke to abraham
[1:09:21] they didn't doubt that they were
[1:09:22] supposed to bring forth the promised son
[1:09:24] she just doubted that it would work for
[1:09:26] her
[1:09:32] i hope more than anything
[1:09:34] that the message that god has given us
[1:09:36] so exposed the devil that we stop
[1:09:38] tripping over the same tripping stones
[1:09:41] but this bride will keep her testimony
[1:09:44] in this day because the tactics of the
[1:09:46] devil have been exposed
[1:09:53] let's look at mr skeptic
[1:09:57] this one has been interesting for me to
[1:09:59] look at
[1:10:02] i don't like this guy
[1:10:04] i don't like any of them but i
[1:10:05] particularly don't like this guy
[1:10:10] this
[1:10:10] skeptic
[1:10:13] he wants you to question
[1:10:18] he wants you to question something he's
[1:10:21] throwing a question
[1:10:23] god doesn't know that the day you eat
[1:10:25] there of like your eyes will be there's
[1:10:27] something more to this you're not
[1:10:29] getting the whole picture something is
[1:10:31] odd something's wrong with this and
[1:10:33] brother bram uses the example of i went
[1:10:35] to a service where he had a little vial
[1:10:36] of oil and they put the oil on me and
[1:10:38] the mr skeptic he'll begin to ask
[1:10:40] questions like how is there healing
[1:10:42] power and oil isn't that just olive oil
[1:10:44] and and he starts mr skeptic starts to
[1:10:47] question the integrity of something and
[1:10:49] what's behind it like why would you put
[1:10:51] oil in somebody and for you who's
[1:10:54] looking at mr skeptic and you've never
[1:10:55] come across a mr skeptic before you're
[1:10:57] like
[1:10:59] duh because the bible says anoint with
[1:11:01] oil
[1:11:03] but then mr skeptic will be like but
[1:11:05] what kind of oil do you need
[1:11:08] does it have to be like extra virgin
[1:11:10] olive oil should it be olive oil and
[1:11:13] imported from israel near gethsemane
[1:11:15] where the olive trees were where god
[1:11:16] prayed
[1:11:18] like what kind of oil and what
[1:11:19] ingredients did we put in the oil did we
[1:11:21] put in the oil kind of like the the same
[1:11:23] fragrance and
[1:11:24] frankincense and myrrh and what was in i
[1:11:26] how do you do and he starts to ask
[1:11:28] questions that are irrelevant and have
[1:11:30] no meaning he's asking about the power
[1:11:32] of the oil and it's not the power of the
[1:11:34] oil it's faith and obedience to the word
[1:11:36] of god but mr skeptic starts pointing
[1:11:38] out and questioning things that don't
[1:11:39] need to be questioned
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:43] he starts sowing doubt and bringing odd
[1:11:46] questions and and asking things what
[1:11:49] what does it matter anyways amen if god
[1:11:51] said do this and i do it i believe god
[1:11:53] knows amen the integrity of my heart if
[1:11:55] i obey his word god will keep his word
[1:12:00] and and mr skeptic
[1:12:02] he he begins to question
[1:12:05] and he begins to
[1:12:08] begins to point out
[1:12:15] possible errors
[1:12:22] ah
[1:12:24] if we look at mr skeptic
[1:12:29] we look at this story in the bible
[1:12:36] at the woman
[1:12:38] who touched
[1:12:42] jesus's
[1:12:43] hymn
[1:12:47] let's look at this story i got the
[1:12:49] scripture wrote down in matthew chapter
[1:12:50] 9. let's go to matthew chapter 9.
[1:13:12] matthew chapter 9 verse 19.
[1:13:21] and jesus arose and followed him and so
[1:13:23] did his disciples
[1:13:25] a behold a woman which was was diseased
[1:13:28] with an issue of blood 12 years came
[1:13:29] behind him and touched the hem of his
[1:13:31] garment
[1:13:32] for she said within herself if i may but
[1:13:35] touch his garment i shall be whole
[1:13:39] but jesus turned him about and when he
[1:13:41] saw her he said daughter be of good
[1:13:43] comfort thy faith hath made thee whole
[1:13:46] and the woman was made whole from that
[1:13:48] hour
[1:13:51] now you take a mr skeptic with a mr
[1:13:53] skeptic spirit and remember mr skeptic
[1:13:56] can be in the church
[1:14:00] and mr skeptic
[1:14:02] he could say something like this
[1:14:06] where did moses tell us to touch the hem
[1:14:08] of somebody's garment
[1:14:11] what scripture did she base her faith
[1:14:13] upon
[1:14:15] where is it written that if you touch
[1:14:17] the hem of somebody's garment you'll be
[1:14:19] made every bit whole but the scripture
[1:14:22] tells us that she said within herself
[1:14:25] if i can but touch the hem of his
[1:14:26] garment i'll be made every bit whole and
[1:14:28] when jesus turned around and looked at
[1:14:29] her he said daughter thy faith has made
[1:14:31] thee whole
[1:14:34] and so mr skeptic will be like
[1:14:38] what kind of
[1:14:39] spiritualism is this
[1:14:43] what do you think the pharisees said
[1:14:44] that day what do you think the fair the
[1:14:46] pharisees wouldn't just accept it as a
[1:14:47] miracle they would explain it away some
[1:14:49] way
[1:14:50] there'd be skeptics within the church
[1:14:52] within the pharisees and the sadducees
[1:14:54] and they would begin to become skeptical
[1:14:55] about this and say you know where where
[1:14:58] did moses where did moses or any of the
[1:15:00] prophets tell us that someday somebody
[1:15:03] will touch the hem of somebody's garment
[1:15:05] and be made every bit whole see she just
[1:15:07] received a revelation she believed it
[1:15:09] acted upon faith and god answered her
[1:15:11] faith and healed her
[1:15:14] but the skeptics they begin to question
[1:15:16] and they begin to say where where was
[1:15:19] this in the in the scriptures and and
[1:15:21] who told her to do that and by what
[1:15:24] authority and and what part of the word
[1:15:27] they begin to bring doubt and they begin
[1:15:28] to bring skepticism and and and begin to
[1:15:31] question things and begin to
[1:15:33] cause a question where there doesn't
[1:15:35] need to be a question why question it
[1:15:37] the woman has made every bit whole
[1:15:42] so
[1:15:43] where
[1:15:44] do we get this
[1:15:46] so
[1:15:47] god
[1:15:48] jesus never
[1:15:50] corrected the woman for having the wrong
[1:15:52] kind of faith or putting faith in the
[1:15:54] wrong thing
[1:15:58] jesus never turned around and said
[1:16:00] listen that'll work this time i'll
[1:16:02] overlook that this time but don't that's
[1:16:04] not the right way
[1:16:12] let's look at
[1:16:13] let's turn over to matthew 14.
[1:16:17] we're going to go a little bit later in
[1:16:18] the story jesus has done works he's been
[1:16:21] traveled to different places
[1:16:23] after this incident took place healed
[1:16:25] more people
[1:16:27] but in chapter 14
[1:16:31] verse 34.
[1:16:35] it says and when they were gone over
[1:16:37] they came into the land of gnesserat
[1:16:40] and when the men of that place had
[1:16:42] knowledge of him they sent out into all
[1:16:44] the country round about and brought unto
[1:16:46] him all that were diseased
[1:16:48] and besought him that they might only
[1:16:50] touch the hem of his garments
[1:16:53] and as many as touched were made
[1:16:55] perfectly whole
[1:16:59] my question is where did they hear about
[1:17:01] this
[1:17:03] where did these people in ganesha when
[1:17:05] he crossed over amen the sea and came to
[1:17:07] ganesha where did they hear about this
[1:17:10] this comes later no doubt the testimony
[1:17:12] of that woman went forward and they had
[1:17:15] the audacity but regardless of what mr
[1:17:17] skeptic said about what scripture and
[1:17:19] wind and moses and this looks like
[1:17:21] spiritualism and blah blah blah they
[1:17:23] would throw all the way and said if it
[1:17:25] worked for her if god honored her faith
[1:17:27] god will honor my faith if it worked for
[1:17:29] her it'll work for me if he's the same
[1:17:31] god there he'll be the same god here
[1:17:33] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:17:35] forever
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:37] and so later when they come over to
[1:17:39] ganesha they begin to lay the sick down
[1:17:42] so that when he walks by they can just
[1:17:44] touch the hem of their garment amen what
[1:17:46] were they doing they had seen god honor
[1:17:49] that kind of faith now they were coming
[1:17:51] with the same kind of faith that god
[1:17:52] honored who cares what mr skeptic said
[1:17:54] about why or with a spiritualism who
[1:17:57] cares god is answering the faith of the
[1:17:59] people that'll just have the simplicity
[1:18:01] to believe god when they see god
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:10] what about this one
[1:18:17] in brother branham's life
[1:18:32] do you remember the story where the jack
[1:18:34] mormon had a brother
[1:18:35] and that brother was having epileptic
[1:18:37] seizures
[1:18:38] and he had him all his life and he was
[1:18:40] going to
[1:18:41] have a surgery for him and brother
[1:18:43] benham told him to get word to him you
[1:18:44] know not to do it or i don't remember
[1:18:45] the exact details of the story but
[1:18:47] anyways he told him they said the next
[1:18:49] time he bring him home and the next time
[1:18:50] he has that fit you rip his shirt off of
[1:18:53] him and throw it to the fire and say i
[1:18:54] do this in the name of jesus christ and
[1:18:56] i'll have no problems no more
[1:18:59] now can you imagine uh sitting there
[1:19:01] that day and mr skeptic comes knocking
[1:19:03] on your door and says where did jesus
[1:19:06] ever do a thing like that where did you
[1:19:07] see that in the bible paul didn't do
[1:19:10] that amen where does he get this from
[1:19:13] this looks like some kind of
[1:19:14] spiritualism
[1:19:18] mr skeptic you know can you imagine if
[1:19:21] it was you if it happened to you i mean
[1:19:23] they're sitting there that day amen and
[1:19:25] and brother brown gives them
[1:19:26] instructions and and the instructions
[1:19:29] are so
[1:19:30] odd to the natural way of thinking
[1:19:33] they're so unusual to anything these
[1:19:35] people have ever experienced before in
[1:19:37] their lives
[1:19:39] and and the prophet of god doesn't give
[1:19:42] them a list of bible references
[1:19:46] he just tells them that next time he has
[1:19:48] that fit tear his shirt off and throw in
[1:19:51] the fire and say i do this in the name
[1:19:52] of the lord jesus christ amen and he'll
[1:19:54] not have problems anymore and he said it
[1:19:56] happened that the next time he had a fit
[1:19:58] his the jack mormon's wife amen was
[1:20:01] there alone and she was afraid when he
[1:20:03] had these fit she'd gather the children
[1:20:05] they would get out of his way when he
[1:20:06] have a fit but she so
[1:20:09] had confidence in this man of god
[1:20:12] that mr skeptic whispered in his ear is
[1:20:15] not going to stop her amen she runs over
[1:20:17] there straddles over top of this young
[1:20:20] man which would be her brother-in-law
[1:20:22] amen rips off his shirt throws it into
[1:20:24] the fire and said i do this in the name
[1:20:26] of jesus christ and he never had an
[1:20:29] epileptic fit after that
[1:20:35] how does mr skeptic handle that
[1:20:39] try to bring doubt and questions and and
[1:20:42] criticisms
[1:20:45] but
[1:20:46] the true believer
[1:20:48] just believes
[1:20:50] mr skeptic saying well that's strange
[1:20:54] listen
[1:20:55] paul never told us to do that
[1:20:59] well that's fine paul never told us to
[1:21:01] do that but i believe it's every bit the
[1:21:04] truth and i believe that was commandment
[1:21:05] from god to that those people
[1:21:09] and so
[1:21:10] mr skeptic can say whatever he wants to
[1:21:12] say he can point to whatever he wants to
[1:21:14] point i believe that with all my heart
[1:21:16] and i believe that was from the lord and
[1:21:17] i believe the lord answered their faith
[1:21:19] because the prophet had the word of the
[1:21:20] lord and he knew exactly what to tell
[1:21:22] them to do in that situation
[1:21:25] it may seem odd to others it may confuse
[1:21:28] others it may cause skepticism to
[1:21:30] increase and people to say where did he
[1:21:32] say this and where did he say that you
[1:21:33] know brother branham said a lot of
[1:21:35] amazing things amen he began to teach
[1:21:37] about a civilization amen that was on
[1:21:40] the earth before
[1:21:41] genesis 1 2 destruction between genesis
[1:21:43] 1 1 and genesis 1 2 said it could have
[1:21:45] been billions of years maybe that's
[1:21:47] where the dinosaurs came from and blah
[1:21:49] blah blah and i'll tell you i believe it
[1:21:51] just the way he said it
[1:21:56] you can doubt it if you want to you can
[1:21:58] question it if you want you can mister
[1:22:00] skepticism could rise up and say well
[1:22:02] you know we really don't have scripture
[1:22:03] and that may have been brother brandon
[1:22:05] just trying to piece something together
[1:22:07] i believe it just the way he said it i
[1:22:10] believe there was something on the earth
[1:22:12] amen that was judged and we find it
[1:22:14] judged in genesis 1 2.
[1:22:16] what it was i don't know all the details
[1:22:19] i don't know but i believe it just the
[1:22:20] way he said it
[1:22:23] you can be skeptical if you want you can
[1:22:25] say well where did paul teach that
[1:22:27] because brother branham said i taught
[1:22:28] what paul taught
[1:22:34] you know
[1:22:35] that when
[1:22:36] when the apostle paul
[1:22:39] wrote a letter
[1:22:42] to the let's say to the corinthians
[1:22:45] he's in prison or wherever he's at at
[1:22:46] the time and he writes a letter to the
[1:22:47] corinthians
[1:22:49] when paul wrote the letter it was just a
[1:22:52] letter
[1:22:54] it was a letter
[1:22:55] he wrote the letter in fact paul didn't
[1:22:57] even write his own letters because
[1:23:00] of whatever his affliction was he had a
[1:23:01] scribe who wrote almost all of his
[1:23:03] letters
[1:23:05] so he would dictate somebody would write
[1:23:07] down what he was dictating to them
[1:23:09] they'd seal it up they'd carry it off to
[1:23:11] the corinthian church they would open it
[1:23:12] up in front of the corinthian church and
[1:23:14] they would read it
[1:23:17] and what paul said to do
[1:23:19] they did
[1:23:22] they didn't say
[1:23:24] what scripture is paul talking about
[1:23:29] when paul says
[1:23:30] that when paul says that the
[1:23:32] circumcision we have now is the
[1:23:34] circumcision of the heart not of the
[1:23:36] flesh
[1:23:37] where did moses say that
[1:23:42] but when paul wrote that letter amen the
[1:23:45] believers in that day they didn't say
[1:23:48] well let's take paul's letter that he
[1:23:51] wrote
[1:23:52] and then all the parts that we can find
[1:23:54] in the scripture will keep but the parts
[1:23:56] that we can't find in the scripture we
[1:23:57] won't keep
[1:24:03] paul's letter
[1:24:04] was the scriptures
[1:24:09] we
[1:24:10] read the bible and when we read the
[1:24:12] bible we're reading a letter that a
[1:24:15] church age messenger and a prophet of
[1:24:16] god wrote to a church in corinth wrote
[1:24:18] to a church in ephesus wrote to a church
[1:24:21] and he wrote it to the church and that
[1:24:23] day they had to receive it by faith
[1:24:26] having faith in who that man
[1:24:28] was they didn't know that what they got
[1:24:31] was the scripture we look back and we
[1:24:34] say when paul says it that's thus saith
[1:24:36] the lord
[1:24:38] is that right
[1:24:39] when paul says amen if paul says this in
[1:24:43] the scripture it's thus saith the lord
[1:24:45] if paul says this is the way you do it
[1:24:46] in the church that's the way you do it
[1:24:48] in the church if paul says amen you
[1:24:50] don't stumble a brother you don't
[1:24:51] stumble a brother if paul says whatever
[1:24:53] paul says in those letters is the way we
[1:24:56] do it is thus saith the lord
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:00] and we look back and say well obviously
[1:25:02] what else would they say it's the bible
[1:25:04] it wasn't the bible in their day
[1:25:06] [Applause]
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:08] and paul was bringing things that put
[1:25:11] him absolutely contrary to the pharisees
[1:25:13] because he was saying things amen that
[1:25:15] you could not find direct correlation
[1:25:18] for in the scripture but paul was
[1:25:20] pulling out grace out of the law and he
[1:25:22] was establishing grace it was all the
[1:25:24] way through the bible but they couldn't
[1:25:27] see it but paul could see it by
[1:25:29] revelation and he would begin to take
[1:25:31] basing it on the entire bible he wrote
[1:25:33] this letter
[1:25:34] [Music]
[1:25:37] and they may not have been able to say
[1:25:39] what he said hear all that
[1:25:42] deuteronomy xyz
[1:25:45] but when he wrote that letter that was
[1:25:48] thus saith the lord to that church
[1:25:51] and there were skeptics in paul's day
[1:25:55] there were skeptics who would say you
[1:25:57] know where does he get this no physical
[1:26:00] circumcision that's not anywhere in the
[1:26:02] bible
[1:26:04] there were a group of judaizers that
[1:26:06] were going around amen behind paul to
[1:26:09] the churches that paul established and
[1:26:10] they were they were bringing back law
[1:26:13] bringing back circumcision this is what
[1:26:15] the book of galatians is all about
[1:26:18] and they were skeptical of paul's
[1:26:20] writing because they believed paul had
[1:26:22] moved them away from the scriptures and
[1:26:24] they were trying to bring them back to
[1:26:25] the scriptures not knowing that paul was
[1:26:28] writing the scriptures
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:30] [Applause]
[1:26:35] but there had to be people that would
[1:26:36] believe the word for their day
[1:26:41] and the apostle paul
[1:26:42] they would take from him handkerchiefs
[1:26:44] and napkins
[1:26:47] and they would take those handkerchiefs
[1:26:49] and napkins and go lay them on the sick
[1:26:51] they would take them from his body and
[1:26:52] lay them on the sick and they would
[1:26:53] recover
[1:26:56] where did the bible say take
[1:26:57] handkerchiefs and napkins
[1:27:02] right but when when the church believed
[1:27:06] it god honored their faith amen because
[1:27:08] god had sent them a messenger in their
[1:27:10] day and they believed that messenger and
[1:27:12] god honored their faith
[1:27:17] so they could be skeptical
[1:27:20] but god honored their faith
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:24] praise god
[1:27:27] they would lay people on the street so
[1:27:29] peter's shadow could pass over them
[1:27:34] what would mr skeptical say about that
[1:27:39] peter coming along had the keys to the
[1:27:41] kingdom was an apostle of jesus christ
[1:27:44] amen filled with the holy ghost and they
[1:27:46] would lay people brother branham he
[1:27:49] listen he made this statement he said
[1:27:50] there was a a woman come here the other
[1:27:52] day was talking to some deacons or
[1:27:54] something in the church and they said
[1:27:56] just show me where the man walked if i
[1:27:58] walk in his footsteps god will heal me
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:03] brother branham didn't say that woman's
[1:28:04] nuts get her out of here brother benham
[1:28:07] said what kind of faith is that
[1:28:13] amen
[1:28:16] amen
[1:28:18] mr skeptic can have a heyday with the
[1:28:20] apostles and with peter and with paul
[1:28:23] and then even with this woman who who
[1:28:26] who had so much faith in the prophet of
[1:28:28] god for a day if she could just she
[1:28:29] believed if i could just walk where the
[1:28:31] man walked i would be healed and brother
[1:28:33] bedam said what faith is that
[1:28:38] praise be to god
[1:28:41] mr
[1:28:42] skepticism
[1:28:44] has had a day
[1:28:46] he's trying to have a day
[1:28:49] he's trying mr skepticism is trying to
[1:28:52] get people to not accept what brother
[1:28:54] branham said if they can't find it in
[1:28:55] the bible
[1:29:01] well that little jack mormon's wife
[1:29:05] she believed it even though she couldn't
[1:29:06] find it in the bible
[1:29:08] and it worked for her
[1:29:12] so this mr skepticism
[1:29:14] he seems religious because remember
[1:29:16] these are in the church he seems
[1:29:17] religious
[1:29:19] because i just want to stay
[1:29:21] i just want to stay where it's safe i
[1:29:23] don't want to get off in fanaticism
[1:29:27] well nobody wants to get off in
[1:29:29] fanaticism
[1:29:31] but the pharisees wanted to stay where
[1:29:32] it was safe the judaizers in the early
[1:29:34] christian church they wanted to stay
[1:29:36] where it was safe with circumcision and
[1:29:37] feast days and all they wanted to stay
[1:29:39] where it was safe but paul was trying to
[1:29:41] bring him to the word they were trying
[1:29:43] to stay in a previous dispensation
[1:29:46] the prophet of god has brought jesus
[1:29:48] christ back to the earth again the
[1:29:49] seventh seal brings him back to the
[1:29:51] earth amen and and he showed us a
[1:29:54] manifestation of christ and he said some
[1:29:56] things and shared some things with us
[1:29:58] amen that they were mind-boggling the
[1:30:00] christians in that day he talked to
[1:30:02] talking about theophanies and how the
[1:30:03] theophany worked and hearing from your
[1:30:05] theophany and all of a sudden you're
[1:30:07] like where does the bible say that i can
[1:30:09] hear from my theophany
[1:30:12] but i believe it with all of my heart
[1:30:14] that i have heard from my theophany then
[1:30:16] i have representation of heaven and when
[1:30:18] i heard when i heard the eagle scream i
[1:30:20] recognized that this is eagle food and i
[1:30:22] left the others i heard from my
[1:30:24] theophany
[1:30:27] i hope you don't question that
[1:30:30] i hope that doesn't stumble you
[1:30:33] because a vindicated prophet of god
[1:30:35] taught it as a truth out of god's word
[1:30:40] but mr skeptic will try to rob our faith
[1:30:45] by bringing questions
[1:30:48] about could it be wrong
[1:30:51] what could it be an opinion
[1:30:53] is it possible
[1:30:56] i say god help me to turn a deaf fear to
[1:30:59] mr skeptic
[1:31:01] and just believe your word
[1:31:09] mr impatient
[1:31:12] mr impatient
[1:31:15] this is a nasty one
[1:31:17] brother bram said he's a rascal
[1:31:22] mr impatience says
[1:31:27] i believed
[1:31:30] and it didn't work
[1:31:36] that statement doesn't work
[1:31:40] i believed and it didn't work means you
[1:31:43] didn't believe
[1:31:47] to say i believed in healing but it
[1:31:49] didn't work i believed god delivered me
[1:31:51] and it didn't work i believe it just
[1:31:52] means you didn't believe or you only had
[1:31:54] an intellectual faith but you didn't
[1:31:56] have the faith of god because the faith
[1:31:57] of god is faith in his word and it
[1:31:59] doesn't fail
[1:32:02] i believed and it didn't work and then
[1:32:04] you realize
[1:32:06] that there's no
[1:32:09] time
[1:32:10] limit to the promise
[1:32:15] god never put a time limit to the
[1:32:17] promise don't let mr and patient put a
[1:32:20] time limit on the promise in you if
[1:32:22] you've been praying for the salvation of
[1:32:24] your loved ones you've been praying for
[1:32:26] your healing you've been praying for
[1:32:27] your deliverance do not let mr impatient
[1:32:30] put up a time limit on god's promise or
[1:32:32] the ability for god to answer your
[1:32:34] prayer hey god can answer your prayer
[1:32:36] after you leave this earth amen but god
[1:32:39] will still honor his word
[1:32:40] you may not even see the effect of your
[1:32:43] prayers you may not even see the effect
[1:32:44] of your faith in god's word but don't
[1:32:46] you let mr impatient rob you of your
[1:32:49] blessing amen don't let him take the
[1:32:51] word out of your heart just because you
[1:32:52] haven't seen it in 10 years you haven't
[1:32:54] seen it in 20 years you haven't seen it
[1:32:56] in 40 years don't let mr and patient
[1:32:58] whisper in your ear
[1:33:00] for there is no time limit to the word
[1:33:02] of god there is no time limit to the
[1:33:04] promise
[1:33:06] god keeps his word
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:14] the word
[1:33:17] is eternal
[1:33:21] so you can't put a time limit on it
[1:33:25] true faith
[1:33:28] is eternal
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:31] when these two things come together
[1:33:34] it's going to happen
[1:33:37] it may not happen tomorrow
[1:33:39] may not happen the next day
[1:33:41] it may not happen and you're in my
[1:33:43] lifetime
[1:33:45] but it will happen
[1:33:48] so to say i believe
[1:33:50] and i waited for months or years and it
[1:33:53] never happened
[1:33:55] just means you didn't believe with the
[1:33:56] right kind of belief
[1:34:01] because the the right kind of believe
[1:34:03] can never stop believing
[1:34:05] it'll believe all the way through to the
[1:34:07] fulfillment of the promise
[1:34:10] now brother bam says in the message
[1:34:12] court trial we're coming back to this
[1:34:13] court trial
[1:34:15] now the defense witness wants to call a
[1:34:17] few witnesses to the platform
[1:34:20] would we have time to do it the defense
[1:34:22] witness wants to call a witness now his
[1:34:24] witness is a prosecuting attorney called
[1:34:26] his witness the defense witness
[1:34:28] shall call first the prophet noah
[1:34:31] and let him witness
[1:34:34] and so noah takes the stand and says but
[1:34:36] noah said god told me it was going to
[1:34:38] rain
[1:34:39] and i believed it i believe if god said
[1:34:42] so he is able to put water up there so i
[1:34:44] pounded away
[1:34:47] mr unbelief scoffed at me mr skeptic
[1:34:50] doubted me mr impatient i pounded away
[1:34:53] till i built the ark every day they came
[1:34:55] by and said well i guess it's going to
[1:34:57] rain today
[1:34:58] see same way i thought you was well i
[1:35:01] thought you was going to get well where
[1:35:03] is the rain at you know after all
[1:35:05] prophet noah as you supposed to be one
[1:35:07] you said that now remember them's not
[1:35:10] that's people that's pretending they are
[1:35:12] believers
[1:35:14] he's talking about those that were
[1:35:15] scoffing and mocking at noah they were
[1:35:18] pretending to be believers they were
[1:35:20] part of the church
[1:35:26] well the prophet noah i'm sorry they
[1:35:28] pretended they were believers no mr
[1:35:31] unbelief mr skeptic and those are they
[1:35:33] play
[1:35:35] they play
[1:35:36] claim they're believers
[1:35:38] well the prophet noah we always knowed
[1:35:40] you as a false prophet because you got
[1:35:42] foolish ideas that don't cope with
[1:35:44] science it don't cope with the modern
[1:35:46] trend
[1:35:47] you you don't cope with our pastors
[1:35:48] there's something wrong we know that
[1:35:50] you're not really a prophet but you said
[1:35:52] it was going to rain that was a month
[1:35:54] ago no rain yet two years past hey hey
[1:35:57] prophet i thought you said that god said
[1:35:58] so he did say so well two years had
[1:36:01] passed five years 20 years 50 years the
[1:36:04] ark is completed
[1:36:06] listen
[1:36:07] noah did not have to debate with mr
[1:36:11] unbeliever
[1:36:12] mr skeptic
[1:36:14] he didn't have to debate with mr
[1:36:15] impatient they kept coming around
[1:36:17] mocking questioning him saying why
[1:36:19] hasn't it happened you said it would
[1:36:20] happen he didn't debate his testimony
[1:36:24] wasn't a rebuttal his testimony was
[1:36:27] taking place behind him in the building
[1:36:28] of the ark
[1:36:30] his witness
[1:36:32] was what he did with his faith when he
[1:36:35] turned around and they were coming up to
[1:36:37] him and they were saying you're all
[1:36:38] wrong there's no rain and science says
[1:36:40] they shot an instrument to the moon
[1:36:42] there's no rain up there and while
[1:36:44] they're talking to them he's planing
[1:36:45] another board
[1:36:48] and they're waiting for a rebuttal you
[1:36:50] know the devil loves for you to give him
[1:36:52] a comeback
[1:36:54] he loves we spend all of our time
[1:36:56] thinking oh if i was quicker i would
[1:36:58] have said that and i would have said
[1:36:59] this and that's what the devil wants he
[1:37:01] wants you to get a little quicker and
[1:37:02] just bring me a comeback because he's
[1:37:04] got more comebacks than you got
[1:37:06] comebacks
[1:37:08] but noah just turned around and
[1:37:10] noah didn't even have to say i believe
[1:37:13] it
[1:37:14] planing the board was testifying that he
[1:37:17] believed
[1:37:18] it you're going to say i believe the
[1:37:21] message no just obeying the message
[1:37:23] proves that you believe the message
[1:37:26] just just believing what god said living
[1:37:30] the way that that the prophet told us to
[1:37:32] live doing the things that he taught us
[1:37:33] to do when he shared with us what was in
[1:37:35] the back part of god's mind and told us
[1:37:37] how a bride member should behave
[1:37:39] themselves dress themselves conduct
[1:37:41] themselves when you take that and you
[1:37:43] turn around and put it into a life you
[1:37:46] witness to mr unbeliever you're
[1:37:47] witnessing the mr skeptic you're
[1:37:49] witnessing to mr impatient that you
[1:37:52] believe that this message is true
[1:37:57] so noah's testimony
[1:37:59] was not just what he preached but his
[1:38:01] testimony that was the ark that was
[1:38:03] taking shape behind him
[1:38:06] year after year you take your wife by
[1:38:08] the hand you grab your children and you
[1:38:10] come to church to hear the word of god
[1:38:13] year after year you start a new message
[1:38:15] book when you finish the one before
[1:38:17] year after year you play the tape on the
[1:38:20] way to church and on the way back year
[1:38:22] after year you constantly are adjusting
[1:38:25] your life to match what god's showing
[1:38:27] you out of the word of god
[1:38:28] year after year you're making these
[1:38:30] little adjustments on oh no that's not
[1:38:32] pleasing to the lord oh i see what the
[1:38:33] prophet's saying now and you're
[1:38:35] understanding the nature of god better
[1:38:37] and you're lining it year after year
[1:38:39] you're playing another tape you're going
[1:38:40] to another serve you're having another
[1:38:43] discussion with your family amen you're
[1:38:45] dressing the way the prophet said
[1:38:47] talking like the prophet said
[1:38:51] and it's a witness against mr unbeliever
[1:38:54] that this message is true
[1:38:56] and that you believe it
[1:39:00] see
[1:39:02] they were watching for some
[1:39:05] great something to prove noah was right
[1:39:08] the great something that would prove
[1:39:10] that was right was too late for their
[1:39:11] repentance
[1:39:14] no one was right noah believed he was
[1:39:16] right knows what the word and his
[1:39:18] witness was taking shape behind him
[1:39:23] five years 20 years 50 years the ark is
[1:39:26] completed
[1:39:28] noah was sitting in the door here comes
[1:39:29] mr scoffer mr unbeliever mr skeptic mr
[1:39:32] impatient well now where is the rain
[1:39:35] god said it was going to rain he didn't
[1:39:37] say when he said it was going to rain he
[1:39:39] didn't say when he just said it's going
[1:39:41] to rain get an ark you'll be safe inside
[1:39:44] him it's going to rain he didn't say
[1:39:46] when it was going to rain he said it's
[1:39:48] going to rain and i built the ark well
[1:39:51] it looks to me like if you built the ark
[1:39:52] and you've done your part god will do
[1:39:54] his part
[1:39:56] he will but he didn't say when he would
[1:39:58] do it
[1:39:59] he just said it's going to do it it's
[1:40:01] going to rain
[1:40:02] can you imagine that conversation no
[1:40:05] testimony for years there's an oncoming
[1:40:08] rain there's an ark of safety coming
[1:40:09] rain arc of safety and his actions
[1:40:11] proved that he believed what he was
[1:40:12] preaching but what happened when it was
[1:40:14] all done
[1:40:16] how many days was it completed and noah
[1:40:18] was sitting there thinking
[1:40:21] you know i don't know what to do next
[1:40:22] i've only done what he told me to do
[1:40:24] and mr scoffer mister impatience they
[1:40:26] begin they begin the same ridicule over
[1:40:28] and over oh the ark's done where's the
[1:40:30] rain you told us to build the ark
[1:40:32] because of the rain the ark's built
[1:40:33] where's the rain
[1:40:36] noah had to be a believer amen god was
[1:40:39] going to test whether he was a believer
[1:40:41] he had to prove that he was a believer
[1:40:43] he had to stay with the word of god
[1:40:45] regardless of even what his own thinking
[1:40:47] was no doubt noah thought when he nailed
[1:40:50] the last board in and the last pitch
[1:40:52] cured he probably thought that moment it
[1:40:54] was time amen
[1:40:56] but noah had to go beyond even his own
[1:40:58] idea about the way god would do it and
[1:41:01] when god did it a different way than his
[1:41:03] idea he had to stay with the word of god
[1:41:05] and say it doesn't matter it's going to
[1:41:06] rain
[1:41:08] if it had been another 120 years
[1:41:11] it was still going to rain
[1:41:14] all
[1:41:16] right he says
[1:41:20] your past to 119 years and just lacked
[1:41:23] about seven days in being 120 years mr
[1:41:26] unbelief mr scoffer all these others
[1:41:29] were saying
[1:41:30] mr skeptic rather mr impatient they all
[1:41:32] made fun of me
[1:41:33] and everything i said was crazy to
[1:41:36] believe such a rational promise is that
[1:41:38] that if god did promise me that he told
[1:41:41] something that wasn't true and he wasn't
[1:41:43] able to back up what he said but i
[1:41:44] believed god and held steady there you
[1:41:46] are i believed i held steady remember
[1:41:49] noah is on the witness stand
[1:41:52] he's witnessing this is his testimony
[1:41:55] and you know one day they came up to
[1:41:56] laugh at me and the door was
[1:41:58] shut they said well the old fanatic went
[1:42:01] out there and shut the door i suppose
[1:42:03] but i heard them but i told them god
[1:42:05] shut the door no doubt that the rain
[1:42:07] will fall today that'll be it
[1:42:10] the first day passed by there was no
[1:42:12] rain
[1:42:13] then they really scoffed at me telling
[1:42:15] god shut the door i don't believe such
[1:42:17] stuff as that noah shut the door himself
[1:42:19] him and his son see scoffer unbeliever
[1:42:21] skeptic
[1:42:23] all right it went on for a while but on
[1:42:24] may the 17th one morning it rained
[1:42:28] and it absolutely destroyed all those
[1:42:30] people that was put to a test against
[1:42:32] the word of god
[1:42:33] and saved those who believed god and
[1:42:35] made preparation for it
[1:42:38] and then noah steps down off the stand
[1:42:41] said now the defense witness now will
[1:42:44] call the second witness
[1:42:46] he calls abraham
[1:42:48] abraham said i was just an ordinary man
[1:42:50] a believer and god spoke to me by his
[1:42:52] word and said one day that i'd have a
[1:42:54] child by sarah sarah was 65 and i was
[1:42:57] 75. i married her when she was about 16
[1:43:00] years old she was my half sister and she
[1:43:02] was sterile and i was she was barren and
[1:43:05] i was sterile so there was no way for us
[1:43:07] to have this child and so we went on for
[1:43:10] years but god promised it and we went
[1:43:12] down and got all the bird eye and the
[1:43:14] pins and everything got ready for the
[1:43:16] baby and made the little booties
[1:43:18] and the first month passed by i said
[1:43:20] sarah remember she was about 20 years
[1:43:22] past menopause said now sarah is there
[1:43:24] any difference this last these last 28
[1:43:27] days no no difference well i know we was
[1:43:30] going to have the baby anyhow and we
[1:43:32] went on and on year after year and i
[1:43:34] still believe god
[1:43:36] mr unbeliever mr skeptic mr impatient
[1:43:39] tried their best to get away they tried
[1:43:42] to tell me i was wrong
[1:43:44] why abraham you was a successful farmer
[1:43:46] you were a fine man everybody thought of
[1:43:49] you but you went off on the deep end you
[1:43:52] are believing something that can't be
[1:43:54] true it's unscientific for an old man
[1:43:56] like you and an old woman like sarah to
[1:43:59] have a baby but i believed god anyhow it
[1:44:02] was 25 years later he didn't tell me
[1:44:04] when i was going to have that baby but
[1:44:06] he said i would have it and i believed
[1:44:08] god and counted anything that was
[1:44:10] contrary as though it was not
[1:44:13] and then abraham stepped down off the
[1:44:15] stand
[1:44:17] he said let's call another witness right
[1:44:18] quick isaiah the prophet
[1:44:21] let's ask him something why he said the
[1:44:23] lord spoke to me one day in a prophecy i
[1:44:26] was a prophet everybody know that i that
[1:44:28] what i said the lord honored and they
[1:44:30] all believed me as a prophet and one day
[1:44:32] there comes something rational and it
[1:44:33] said a virgin shall conceive now that
[1:44:35] was unusual
[1:44:39] then isaiah steps off the
[1:44:42] the stand and the defense witness calls
[1:44:44] another one he says quickly let's call
[1:44:46] another one let's call moses
[1:44:48] and everybody laughed at me because i
[1:44:50] was right then 80 years old i had a
[1:44:52] white beard hanging way down like this
[1:44:54] and i had my wife sitting on a mule and
[1:44:56] the little gershom on her side and i was
[1:44:58] going down to egypt and my ass set
[1:45:00] towards heaven and this old crooked
[1:45:01] stick in my hand i was going down to
[1:45:04] take over
[1:45:05] a one-man invasion
[1:45:07] and the thing of it was he did it that's
[1:45:09] right he did it with a crooked stick
[1:45:11] where he couldn't do it with an army but
[1:45:14] god said so that settled it
[1:45:16] i'm just pulling excerpts
[1:45:18] then moses steps off the stand he said
[1:45:21] let's just grab another witness right
[1:45:24] quick before we leave let's pull up
[1:45:26] joshua here
[1:45:28] joshua said moses took one out of every
[1:45:30] tribe every denomination and he sent us
[1:45:32] over to spy out the land and when we got
[1:45:34] there at the river and looked across
[1:45:36] there and seen those amalekites and the
[1:45:38] amorites perizzites and what more said
[1:45:40] they were giants the people screamed out
[1:45:42] for fear well we can't do that
[1:45:47] and and brother bam goes one after one
[1:45:50] in this trial and he brings them up and
[1:45:52] they begin to testify of they withstood
[1:45:55] mr skeptic they withstood mr unbelief
[1:45:57] they were stood mister in patient and
[1:46:00] every one of them had their trial moses
[1:46:03] had his trial
[1:46:05] uh joshua had his testing amen when the
[1:46:08] spies went across they were all part of
[1:46:10] the church they were all part of the
[1:46:11] same church amen and 12 of them went
[1:46:13] across they all saw the same thing they
[1:46:16] had all heard the same promise when they
[1:46:18] went across the land they all saw the
[1:46:19] same thing and they come back with two
[1:46:22] different reports
[1:46:24] the majority of the church says we can't
[1:46:27] take it two joshua and caleb said if god
[1:46:30] is with us we're more than able to take
[1:46:32] it they're but bred for us they saw the
[1:46:34] same thing they testified when they come
[1:46:36] back they all had the same testimony
[1:46:38] there's walled cities there's giants
[1:46:40] there's fruit there's milk and honey
[1:46:42] it's everything that he said they all
[1:46:44] they all saw the same thing the ten that
[1:46:46] were afraid didn't see something
[1:46:48] different than joshua and caleb saw
[1:46:52] but joshua and caleb believed the word
[1:46:54] of god that was the difference
[1:46:57] and when they come back with skepticism
[1:46:59] and unbelief amen when they come back
[1:47:01] with all of that amen joshua and caleb
[1:47:04] they took their stand on the word of god
[1:47:06] and believed that they were more than
[1:47:07] able to take him
[1:47:09] moses took a stand isaiah took a stand
[1:47:12] micaiah took a step all the way down
[1:47:14] through one could come up and testify
[1:47:16] one after another after another after
[1:47:19] another that the word of god worked amen
[1:47:22] amen the the the devil came he tempted
[1:47:25] me with unbelief tempted me with time
[1:47:27] tempted me with skepticism but the word
[1:47:30] always held true
[1:47:32] remember when brother bram starts this
[1:47:33] trial he starts with the prosecutor
[1:47:35] which is satan making an accusation
[1:47:37] against god that he doesn't keep his
[1:47:39] word and he brought three witnesses and
[1:47:41] he brought three examples out of the
[1:47:42] bible and three witnesses but the
[1:47:44] defense witness comes the holy ghost
[1:47:47] with witnesses and he's got a string of
[1:47:49] them coming moses amen he brings elijah
[1:47:52] he can bring isaiah he can bring joshua
[1:47:55] he can bring caleb he can bring david he
[1:47:58] can bring solomon and every one of them
[1:48:00] could testify the same thing that the
[1:48:02] word works amen
[1:48:04] the promise of god is true it was put to
[1:48:07] the test in my life i stood with the
[1:48:09] word and the word worked
[1:48:11] the promise of god was true amen i
[1:48:15] failed i messed up i didn't always get
[1:48:17] it right but his word was always true
[1:48:19] and what he promised always came to pass
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:23] and brother branham goes down in this
[1:48:26] service
[1:48:27] and he finally comes to this part this
[1:48:29] thrilled my heart
[1:48:31] he said now it's getting late
[1:48:34] now just let me have one more witness
[1:48:37] brother branham he's the one moderating
[1:48:39] this he's telling the story he's telling
[1:48:41] you you know the
[1:48:43] the prosecutor satan his witnesses their
[1:48:45] story now the defense witness the holy
[1:48:47] ghost he's calling all these and he's
[1:48:49] building and he's building and he said

[1:49:57] him who would like to give their
[1:49:59] testimony who would like to be able to
[1:50:00] stand in his defense that this word
[1:50:02] works amen i mean the word works under
[1:50:05] every circumstance under every condition

[1:50:18] is nothing but the truth
[1:50:25] listen friends
[1:50:26] hattie wright can take the stand
[1:50:32] hattie wright
[1:50:34] was sitting there one day
[1:50:36] in her parents home listening to a story
[1:50:38] that was unbelievable
[1:50:42] unless you're a believer
[1:50:46] how a man
[1:50:47] in the woods heard a voice
[1:50:51] and that voice told him
[1:50:54] that he could
[1:50:55] create that he could ask for something
[1:50:58] and it would be given to him
[1:51:00] and he's having a conversation with an
[1:51:01] invisible voice and that invisible voice
[1:51:04] is god almighty telling him
[1:51:07] as a sin born
[1:51:09] human being
[1:51:11] telling him that he could
[1:51:14] he could
[1:51:15] speak and request anything and god would
[1:51:17] back up his words
[1:51:21] and
[1:51:22] he's telling the story
[1:51:25] and he's relating the story
[1:51:27] and and he's talking about you know i
[1:51:29] said well
[1:51:31] he says what should i ask for he says
[1:51:32] well you're hunting well you have need
[1:51:34] of and and brother baby says well a
[1:51:36] squirrels he said how many do you want
[1:51:40] listen
[1:51:41] this pre
[1:51:42] we have to sometimes go back and erase
[1:51:45] so much of our minds for us this is not
[1:51:46] a complicated story and that day that
[1:51:48] was a complicated story
[1:51:53] and there's a man just in a little poor
[1:51:55] house and a little poor table with a
[1:51:58] group of little poor people telling
[1:52:00] about a conversation that god is having
[1:52:02] with his prophet and his prophet is
[1:52:04] dressed in like hunting clothes
[1:52:07] and he's saying i said well i'll take
[1:52:09] one and in that tree and we'll have one
[1:52:13] over here and then and he says but you
[1:52:16] said three and he says oh well we'll
[1:52:18] take one and he said i wanted to make it
[1:52:20] hard it made it run across the field and
[1:52:22] go up into a locust tree amen because
[1:52:24] there's never a squirrel in the locust
[1:52:26] tree or whatever it was
[1:52:28] and so he made it real hard and he said
[1:52:30] and it happened exactly the way he said
[1:52:33] this squirrel appeared here that
[1:52:35] squirrel appeared here the other one ran
[1:52:36] down and came from this direction and
[1:52:38] went up in that spot and he shot it and
[1:52:40] he's telling this story to this group of
[1:52:42] humble people and this little humble
[1:52:44] woman amen she she said brother brenham
[1:52:47] that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:52:52] listen i i
[1:52:54] i hope that you can catch this in the
[1:52:56] gravity that it hits my heart
[1:53:01] she didn't have
[1:53:03] any scripture to say that a man will
[1:53:05] create squirrels
[1:53:08] in the end time
[1:53:11] she didn't have anything to check that
[1:53:13] story with
[1:53:16] she only thinks she could check it with
[1:53:17] was the faith she had in her heart that
[1:53:19] he's telling me the truth
[1:53:22] she can't verify it by eyewitnesses
[1:53:26] they didn't have a video of the event
[1:53:29] how was she going to verify this
[1:53:33] but when she said that's nothing but the
[1:53:35] truth brother branham brother branham
[1:53:37] said the power of god came down at that
[1:53:39] table and told him to stand to his feet
[1:53:41] he stood to his feet and said give her
[1:53:42] what she wants said sister hattie god
[1:53:44] told me to give you whatever you want
[1:53:46] listen whatever you want
[1:53:50] once it was spoken it was too late to
[1:53:52] retract amen that woman could have asked
[1:53:54] for anything she wanted if she wanted
[1:53:57] another world she could have had another
[1:53:59] world a million dollars a healing of her
[1:54:01] sister she could have anything she
[1:54:04] wanted amen but the kind of person who
[1:54:07] had the right kind of faith to believe
[1:54:09] what this prophet was saying god knew
[1:54:11] would ask for the right thing he knew it
[1:54:13] was in her heart the most valuable thing
[1:54:15] in her heart was salvation was eternal
[1:54:17] life she didn't want the temporal thing
[1:54:19] she wanted the eternal things why
[1:54:22] because she was a child of god she was a
[1:54:24] believer
[1:54:27] god stood a prophet on his feet and said
[1:54:29] give her whatever
[1:54:30] she wants
[1:54:32] and she was given and brother ram's
[1:54:33] trying to help her you know you need
[1:54:35] this and you're poor and you take care
[1:54:37] of your mom and dad and your sister
[1:54:40] but all she wanted she goes my greatest
[1:54:42] desire in my heart is to see the
[1:54:43] salvation of my two boys
[1:54:46] and god gave her what she asked for
[1:54:50] i don't know
[1:54:51] this is just
[1:54:53] as far as i know i don't know much
[1:54:56] but i don't know anybody else in the
[1:54:58] history of mankind that i know of
[1:55:01] that was given the right to ask for
[1:55:03] anything that they wanted
[1:55:05] and guaranteed that they would get it
[1:55:10] brother branham went through that
[1:55:12] and had he right
[1:55:15] and i'd say what hattie wright said
[1:55:18] pleased god
[1:55:20] that's what brother branham said that
[1:55:21] plea what she said pleased god
[1:55:27] all of this
[1:55:28] skepticism that's floating around the
[1:55:30] message is not pleasing god
[1:55:34] all of this trying to prove something
[1:55:36] and all of this
[1:55:38] it doesn't please god
[1:55:41] but what pleases god is somebody who
[1:55:43] believes the word of god
[1:55:45] and somebody who will turn around and
[1:55:47] live what they believe
[1:55:49] to demonstrate it and say this message
[1:55:51] is to where else will we go
[1:55:54] where else would we go thou alone have
[1:55:56] the words of eternal life where else
[1:55:57] will we go where else will we turn what
[1:55:59] else would we believe
[1:56:01] where else can we go i have to accept
[1:56:04] god's mouthpiece for me because this is
[1:56:06] what brought the truth in this day i
[1:56:08] have to believe it i have to accept it
[1:56:09] what else can i do where else can i go
[1:56:13] [Applause]
[1:56:19] we have time for one more
[1:56:23] if you pardon me
[1:56:24] may i be that witness
[1:56:26] when he said that when i was reading
[1:56:28] this my heart just nearly exploded i
[1:56:30] said oh praise god let me be that
[1:56:33] witness if there's going to be a last
[1:56:35] one to testify let me be that don't get
[1:56:37] through without my testimony don't move
[1:56:40] through the case without my witness and
[1:56:42] i tell you friends this case is not
[1:56:44] going to be finished until you've given
[1:56:45] your testimony until you've given your
[1:56:47] witness because the bride overcomes all
[1:56:50] those who overcome satan overcome by the
[1:56:52] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[1:56:54] testimony
[1:56:57] don't worry you got your chance you've
[1:57:00] got your chance right now amen this
[1:57:02] whole world is under trial the court
[1:57:04] case is taking place now amen you've got
[1:57:06] your chance stand on the witness booth
[1:57:09] and testify amen testify by your words
[1:57:11] testify by your deeds testify by your
[1:57:14] lives testify that this word is the
[1:57:16] truth this message is right and god
[1:57:19] didn't lie he didn't send us something
[1:57:20] false he sent us his word
[1:57:25] brother bannon goes on to say then in
[1:57:27] the same message he's praying he said
[1:57:32] you you are your mind is the jury
[1:57:35] and your action is your judge
[1:57:39] the way you judge whether this word is
[1:57:41] true or not is by your action
[1:57:45] now bow your heads just a moment he
[1:57:46] begins to pray
[1:57:48] lord jesus the trial hasn't started how
[1:57:50] many more could we call up here on the
[1:57:52] platform
[1:57:54] if they lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:57:55] recover you said the works that i do
[1:57:57] shall you do also the woman touched her
[1:57:59] garment you turned and told her what had
[1:58:02] happened
[1:58:03] and you keep all your words there is
[1:58:04] none of them wrong
[1:58:06] the wrong is in the unbeliever
[1:58:08] lord mr unbeliever he's the one that
[1:58:10] contaminates the person mr skeptic and
[1:58:12] that impatient one that can't wait upon
[1:58:15] the lord and yet call himself the seat
[1:58:17] of abraham oh holy spirit the defense
[1:58:20] witness you know who has faith and who
[1:58:22] don't
[1:58:24] i say god
[1:58:26] i'm thankful
[1:58:28] that i get a chance to testify
[1:58:31] that i get a chance to witness i i
[1:58:34] listened to what brother bran was saying
[1:58:35] in the trial and we went all through it
[1:58:37] and when he got to this part if we could
[1:58:39] have just one more do you pardon me if i
[1:58:41] could take the stand is it all right
[1:58:42] could i be that final witness and i
[1:58:45] something in my heart says no let me
[1:58:47] have my turn don't end the case i want
[1:58:49] to testify
[1:58:51] because i was raised in
[1:58:52] denominationalism i thought i knew god i
[1:58:55] thought i believed the truth i thought i
[1:58:57] was a good boy i thought i had what was
[1:58:59] right but the voice of god in my day
[1:59:01] resurrected me out of dead denominations
[1:59:04] and woke me up to who god really is what
[1:59:06] i had believed in was not the real god
[1:59:08] of the word
[1:59:11] i was stuck i was shrouded in darkness i
[1:59:13] was every bit just like lazarus wound up
[1:59:16] in grave clothes and behind a big old
[1:59:18] rock keeping me from christ
[1:59:22] but the voice of the resurrection came
[1:59:24] in my day and i heard that voice and
[1:59:26] that voice called my name just as
[1:59:29] deliberate as he called lazarus out of
[1:59:31] that grave he called chad lamb out of
[1:59:33] dead denominationalism and brought me
[1:59:35] back into the life i was always meant to
[1:59:37] be in
[1:59:39] i want to stand as a witness i want to
[1:59:42] testify let my life testify let my
[1:59:44] actions testify that i believe this word
[1:59:47] is true that this message is christ
[1:59:53] let everything i do
[1:59:56] testify that this word is true
[2:00:00] i was
[2:00:01] i was a a pentecostal boy
[2:00:04] raised pentecostal all my life went to
[2:00:06] church i i was probably a week or two
[2:00:08] old when i went to church and probably
[2:00:09] never missed more than two weeks worth
[2:00:11] of services my entire life
[2:00:15] my
[2:00:16] my there's a string of pentecostal
[2:00:18] preachers in my family that go all the
[2:00:20] way back to azusa street my grandpa was
[2:00:22] a preacher my great uncle was my pastor
[2:00:24] i mean we had it on both sides
[2:00:29] and i thought that i was right i thought
[2:00:31] that i was in a truth and i thought that
[2:00:32] i knew the bible
[2:00:35] but you know i had no ability to live a
[2:00:37] righteous life
[2:00:40] i was living a hypocritical life i
[2:00:42] wanted to be good but had no power to
[2:00:44] live good
[2:00:46] i wanted to be a christian i wanted to
[2:00:49] be holy i wanted to be clean but i could
[2:00:52] not make myself clean and the word that
[2:00:55] i was given was not producing a holy
[2:00:57] life it was producing a hypocritical
[2:01:00] life
[2:01:05] but then one day i heard a voice
[2:01:08] it was a voice from the other side of
[2:01:10] that rock
[2:01:12] said roll the stone away and loose him
[2:01:14] let him out of his grave clothes he's
[2:01:16] all bound up in denominational teaching
[2:01:18] he's all bound up in wrong understanding
[2:01:20] let him loose and let him live amen
[2:01:23] that's my sign and there's something
[2:01:25] that took place there was an experience
[2:01:26] that took place that changed me forever
[2:01:29] and it was no longer trying desperately
[2:01:31] to live good and hope that i'd be all
[2:01:32] right but something in me changed and
[2:01:34] this word came into me and there was
[2:01:36] another life that come into me and now
[2:01:38] what i wanted more than anything and all
[2:01:40] my desire was to please him and to serve
[2:01:43] him
[2:01:44] the power of the holy ghost came to be a
[2:01:46] witness and that witness came to make me
[2:01:48] a witness
[2:01:52] and we found that the word of god is
[2:01:54] true
[2:01:56] that this message is true
[2:01:58] within it is the power of transformation
[2:02:02] to take us from church members to bride
[2:02:06] i'd say i'd like to testify to you
[2:02:08] tonight or to this morning it may be
[2:02:11] tonight by the time i'm done
[2:02:15] but this message still has the power of
[2:02:18] transformation because it's the word of
[2:02:20] god
[2:02:21] in this message that that's being
[2:02:24] preached that the prophet of god gave us
[2:02:25] in this day this message has the power
[2:02:28] to take you from a church member sitting
[2:02:30] in your seat right now
[2:02:32] to the bride of jesus christ
[2:02:36] this this message has the power to
[2:02:39] transform you into the bride of jesus
[2:02:41] christ
[2:02:43] don't stay a church member
[2:02:46] amen
[2:02:47] receive this word become one with it
[2:02:50] feed on it take it into you become one
[2:02:52] with this message amen the message is to
[2:02:54] be taken in amen it's not to be talked
[2:02:57] about it's to be lived
[2:02:59] [Music]
[2:03:02] praise god
[2:03:07] i want to be a witness
[2:03:10] but it's not about even wanting to be a
[2:03:11] witness
[2:03:12] i've been called to be a witness
[2:03:15] because revelations 12
[2:03:17] is taking place
[2:03:19] it'll come to its fullness the bride
[2:03:21] goes up word by word when the bride is
[2:03:24] translated as a whole satan is cast out
[2:03:26] and heaven rejoices
[2:03:29] it's because of our testimony our
[2:03:32] witness
[2:03:33] each one of us are having the privilege
[2:03:35] of standing in the witness booth what
[2:03:37] are we witnessing in the witness booth
[2:03:40] what is our testimony what do we believe
[2:03:42] what is true what can we say when mr
[2:03:45] unbeliever comes in what do you have to
[2:03:47] say
[2:03:48] this is my question as we we finished
[2:03:50] this morning when mr unbelief comes to
[2:03:53] you what do you have to say when mr
[2:03:56] skeptic comes to you not a brother or
[2:03:58] sister not somewhere else but when mr
[2:04:00] skeptic comes to you what do you have to
[2:04:02] say when mr impatient comes to you what
[2:04:04] do you have to say amen because we're
[2:04:06] here
[2:04:07] testifying our life is a witness that
[2:04:10] this message is the truth amen
[2:04:13] and god has called us to be that witness
[2:04:16] he sent his holy ghost to give us the
[2:04:18] power
[2:04:19] to be witnesses
[2:04:21] and i want to testify
[2:04:24] that this was the only way for me
[2:04:28] tried religion didn't work
[2:04:30] tried willpower it failed
[2:04:34] but this word is the power of
[2:04:35] transformation
[2:04:37] and it was the thing that worked for me
[2:04:41] we could go on
[2:04:42] with testimony after testimony after
[2:04:46] testimony
[2:04:48] but we're testifying
[2:04:50] in satan's eden
[2:04:52] remember when brother bam starts this
[2:04:54] court trial he says the prosecutor
[2:04:57] brought the case
[2:05:00] the prosecutor is bringing the case
[2:05:03] trying to discredit god's word the
[2:05:05] prosecutor is bringing it trying to
[2:05:07] bring a discredit bringing witnesses and
[2:05:09] and talking of the scriptures amen but
[2:05:12] the holy ghost has a chance as a defense
[2:05:14] witness
[2:05:16] and the defense witness is calling on
[2:05:18] you to take the stand how many of you
[2:05:21] want to take the stand
[2:05:23] and say
[2:05:24] this word
[2:05:25] is the truth
[2:05:28] i can testify it's the truth i can
[2:05:31] testify that what that prophet said is
[2:05:33] nothing but the truth
[2:05:36] it's been true every way he said it it's
[2:05:38] been true in every part of my life it's
[2:05:40] true and when mr impatient comes and
[2:05:42] says we'll still wait about this what
[2:05:44] about this and what about that mr
[2:05:45] skeptic comes you say you go go talk to
[2:05:48] somebody else i already believe it
[2:05:50] [Music]
[2:05:52] but what about it's been month you go
[2:05:53] talk to somebody else i already believe
[2:05:55] it but what about this discrepancy the
[2:05:57] prophet said this one way here and he
[2:05:59] said it this one way the other way you
[2:06:01] say mr skeptic go talk to somebody else
[2:06:03] i already believe it
[2:06:05] it's already
[2:06:07] true
[2:06:09] amen let's all stand
[2:06:12] musicians if you can come
[2:06:15] brother branham says in the fourth seal
[2:06:18] he said notice now he will be given a
[2:06:20] heart of a beast at that time
[2:06:22] and satan will incarnate himself because
[2:06:24] when the church goes up
[2:06:26] satan's cast out
[2:06:28] see
[2:06:30] it's done then
[2:06:32] all
[2:06:33] of his accusing
[2:06:35] is done
[2:06:37] there's coming a time
[2:06:40] where the testimony of the bride
[2:06:42] will be the finishing of the accusation
[2:06:45] of the devil
[2:06:46] he'll be done
[2:06:48] accusing
[2:06:50] because there's a bride that'll stand
[2:06:52] in full faith
[2:06:54] in the full word of god
[2:06:56] with no more unbelief
[2:06:58] and her life will reflect the very life
[2:07:00] of jesus christ and her testimony
[2:07:04] her testimony
[2:07:06] will stop the mouth of the accuser
[2:07:09] she'll go up
[2:07:10] he'll be cast out all of his accusing
[2:07:13] will be over
[2:07:16] friends that's
[2:07:17] what we've been called to
[2:07:20] say lord help us
[2:07:21] to take your word
[2:07:23] and stand with that word regardless of
[2:07:25] what happens around us
[2:07:28] not as a group
[2:07:29] as an individual
[2:07:31] this is not a group prayer although i
[2:07:33] want it for everybody that's in here i
[2:07:35] would desire for every one of us but
[2:07:37] that's not the age we live in it's the
[2:07:38] individual age it's time for the
[2:07:40] individual to be called with an
[2:07:42] individual experience and have an
[2:07:43] individual revelation
[2:07:46] and now as individuals you've been
[2:07:48] called to witness in the witness stand
[2:07:50] amen what will you witness what will
[2:07:51] your testimony be what will you have to
[2:07:53] say
[2:07:54] amen what has this message done for you
[2:07:56] what has it brought you to
[2:07:58] what is christ done inside of you
[2:08:01] through you
[2:08:02] what is our testimony
[2:08:04] because the bride
[2:08:06] will have the final testimony for the
[2:08:08] gentile dispensation
[2:08:11] and i want to give a true testimony
[2:08:14] let's bow our heads and pray
[2:08:17] lord jesus we thank you father for your
[2:08:19] word

[2:08:23] day that we live

[2:08:31] noah and his day and moses in his day
[2:08:34] jeremiah in his day in isaiah the day
[2:08:37] that he lived in
[2:08:38] joshua
[2:08:40] but god this isn't that day
[2:08:43] this is a day that you've called us as
[2:08:45] individuals to take our
[2:08:47] time

[2:08:50] to give our witness
[2:08:52] and lord we desire with all of our
[2:08:54] hearts to give a true witness
[2:08:56] but it's going to take the spirit of
[2:08:58] truth to give us the power to be a true
[2:09:00] witness
[2:09:01] i pray god that you would fill your
[2:09:03] children with your spirit lord
[2:09:05] that you would pour it out upon us lord
[2:09:07] that would receive the power to be true
[2:09:09] witnesses in this day and then we'll be
[2:09:11] witnesses here and abroad and wherever
[2:09:14] you should lead us lord that we could
[2:09:15] witness that this gospel is the truth
[2:09:18] that this there is a bride upon the
[2:09:20] earth that will take you at your word
[2:09:22] and that word will be fulfilled
[2:09:25] god we thank you for all you've done for
[2:09:27] us we thank you for that prophet that
[2:09:29] you sent in this day that wanted to be
[2:09:31] the one to take the stand on that day
[2:09:33] he said can i take the stand and he
[2:09:35] could go on and testify for days and for
[2:09:38] weeks of what he saw you do
[2:09:41] but god that wasn't the last testimony
[2:09:43] that you wanted on this earth

[2:10:30] let our lives give a true testimony a
[2:10:33] true witness
[2:10:34] that this word is the truth
[2:10:36] and god i pray that you'd put inside of
[2:10:38] us an eagerness like the prophet had to
[2:10:41] take the stand
[2:10:42] to tell of how true your word is
[2:10:45] and the face of skeptics it's true
[2:10:48] and the face of unbelievers it's true
[2:10:51] and the face of those who are impatient
[2:10:53] it's true lord your word is true
[2:10:56] we're so thankful for the privilege of
[2:10:58] being your witnesses in this end time
[2:11:01] may you empower us and equip us
[2:11:04] god i ask if there's anybody here lord
[2:11:07] that is afraid to take the stand
[2:11:10] is not sure of their testimony doesn't
[2:11:12] know for sure what they would say
[2:11:15] there's anybody here that would be a
[2:11:16] little reluctant to stand on that stand
[2:11:19] i pray god that you would just energize
[2:11:21] him now and fill him with your spirit
[2:11:23] god bring them to a desire where they
[2:11:25] would open themselves to you and say god
[2:11:27] i need something more i'm a little
[2:11:29] intimidated by the witnessing stand i
[2:11:31] need something from you i need your
[2:11:33] spirit to give me that power
[2:11:35] god i pray that you would grant it to
[2:11:37] all that are asking now anyone lord i
[2:11:39] just pray you put them in them so that
[2:11:41] they would have the boldness that peter
[2:11:43] had on the day of pentecost when he
[2:11:45] rushed out and said this is that that
[2:11:47] the prophet joel had said
[2:11:49] i am convinced and know that this is the
[2:11:51] word being manifest in our day
[2:11:54] i pray you'd make it a reality in all of
[2:11:56] our lives lord
[2:11:58] bless your people bless us as we leave
[2:12:00] here

[2:12:06] our lives and in our speech and in our
[2:12:08] conduct that we might testify that the
[2:12:11] word is nothing but the truth
[2:12:15] that the message you've given us is
[2:12:17] nothing but the truth
