[0:00] we can get ourselves on a death walk if
[0:02] we ever leave the leadership of the
[0:04] guide amen if we ever get self-confident
[0:07] self-sufficient if we ever believe that
[0:09] i know the word and i know the message
[0:11] and you can't stop me and i don't need a
[0:13] guide and then you're going to want why
[0:15] wind up right back on a death march and
[0:17] come right back to the same thing
[0:20] and the whole time then you start off
[0:21] again and say it will be different this
[0:23] time
[0:25] i'll pay i'll pay closer attention this
[0:27] time i'll use all my spiritual skills as
[0:31] a believer and you come right back to
[0:33] the same same issue same problem same
[0:35] thing
[0:38] we don't want to get on a death walk
[0:41] how do you prevent a death walk
[0:43] stay with the guide
[0:45] there's only one guy that's the holy
[0:47] ghost
[0:48] and brother benham even began to talk
[0:50] amen he began to explain that god always
[0:52] has a guide for his people
[0:55] and he said he sends a prophet many
[0:57] times as a guy god always has a guide
[0:59] but he says it's the guide in the person
[1:01] he said there was a guide in moses moses
[1:03] wasn't the guy the guide was working
[1:05] through moses brother branham wasn't the
[1:07] guide it was the holy ghost it was the
[1:09] son of man working through a son of man
[1:11] was the guide amen but you still have to
[1:13] recognize where the guide's working amen
[1:16] you have to be attentive and say the guy
[1:19] the guide the holy ghost is working
[1:21] through this ministry amen through this
[1:24] prophet in the end time i'm going to
[1:26] follow that message i'm going to follow
[1:27] that prophet because that's the guide
[1:31] amen but god also works through his
[1:33] fivefold ministry he works through gifts
[1:35] amen and he guides his church it's not
[1:37] the ministry it's the guide we have to
[1:39] be able to recognize the guide so so
[1:42] many people have wanted to go their own
[1:44] way they don't want a prophet
[1:46] because it's too restricting they don't
[1:48] want to fight for ministry because the
[1:49] fivefold ministry has failed hey hey
[1:52] listen the fifo ministries failed and
[1:54] they're going to fail again but it's
[1:55] still god's provided way
[1:57] it doesn't mean that i can now make my
[2:00] own spiritual journey without any kind
[2:02] of guidance with no shepherd at all god
[2:04] is the great shepherd and he works
[2:06] through shepherds god's the great guide
[2:07] and he works through men to be guides
[2:10] and he guides us individually as the
[2:12] spirit that speaks to us and gives us
[2:13] individual leadership
[2:15] and he has to be that kind of guide all
[2:18] the way around for us
