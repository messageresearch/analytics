[0:00] brother Bantam does some wonderful
[0:01] things in the word amen to bring us to a
[0:05] higher Revelation and understanding of
[0:06] the life we live in we are not going to
[0:09] live a life free of trial and
[0:10] tribulations God doesn't want us to
[0:13] meant so much Prosperity preaching
[0:15] another kind of preaching and it makes
[0:17] it makes it sound like God never wants
[0:20] you to suffer any God doesn't want any
[0:22] hardship or any obstacles to come your
[0:24] way that God's a doting grandfather and
[0:26] he wants to remove everything so that
[0:27] you can live a blessed life and
[0:29] everything can be perfect amen but
[0:31] brother Benham come along and told us
[0:32] that's not the reason we're living in
[0:34] this Earth We're living here for
[0:36] education so that we can gain character
[0:38] to Reign by in the next life and that
[0:41] character is a victory not a gift and it
[0:43] comes through hardships through trials
[0:45] through testings
[0:47] so the prophet of God came and he
[0:49] brought reality back to Christianity
[0:52] the churches have taken reality away
[0:54] amen but he's coming brought reality
[0:56] back so that you can live the same kind
[0:58] of Life they lived in the scriptures
[1:02] so then we're not confused when
[1:03] difficult circumstances come up there's
[1:05] no confusion
[1:07] now God why would he bring him
[1:11] out of Egypt Into the Wilderness
[1:13] delivered them from a mighty hand slew
[1:16] the army that was after them brought
[1:18] them into such a wonderful Victory and
[1:20] the next thing he does is he lands them
[1:22] by by a spring of bitter water that they
[1:24] can't even drink another trial why he
[1:26] wants to show them that he loves them
[1:28] some more
[1:33] God why is this happening to me God why
[1:36] why
[1:37] maybe he wants to show you who loves you
[1:39] again
[1:41] or maybe he wants to show you his power
[1:43] and his goodness
[1:46] maybe he allowed the circumstances to
[1:48] get such a way so that he can show you
[1:50] how able he is to deliver
