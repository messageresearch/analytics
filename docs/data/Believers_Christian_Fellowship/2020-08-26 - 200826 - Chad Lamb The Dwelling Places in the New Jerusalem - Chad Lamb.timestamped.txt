[3:27] [Applause]
[3:31] the master of the wind i know the maker
[3:39] of the rain
[3:43] he can come
[3:51] [Music]
[3:57] sometimes i saw like an eagle
[4:01] in the sky among the peaks
[4:05] my soul can be found
[4:10] an unexpected storm
[4:14] [Music]
[4:14] [Applause]
[4:17] it can bring me low but it can bring me
[4:20] down

[5:15] [Music]
[5:17] praise the lord amen
[5:21] it's good to know the master of the wind
[5:24] when contrary winds are blowing it's
[5:27] good to know the master of the wind
[5:29] man god bless you friends while we're
[5:31] standing if you could take your bibles
[5:34] and turn
[5:35] to psalm chapter 1
[5:39] verse 1. i'm gonna keep kind of on the
[5:43] same theme we've been on
[5:44] i can't seem to get away from it so
[5:47] we're just going to stick with it
[5:48] and i keep bouncing in my in my mind and
[5:51] in my understanding between
[5:53] solomon's kingdom that he set up in the
[5:55] golden age of
[5:57] of israel and the new jerusalem and
[6:00] and i just keep bouncing back and forth
[6:02] and so we may talk about the new
[6:03] jerusalem
[6:04] today and maybe sunday we'll be back in
[6:07] in the solomon's golden age but praise
[6:10] be to god
[6:11] i just see so many similarities to where
[6:13] we are now
[6:14] i see so many parallels to what's going
[6:17] on with us now
[6:18] and i just like to explore that in psalm
[6:20] chapter 1 verse 1
[6:23] let's read blessed is the man that
[6:25] walketh not in the counsel the ungodly
[6:27] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[6:29] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[6:32] but his delight is in the law of the
[6:34] lord and in the law doth he meditate day
[6:36] and night
[6:37] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[6:39] the rivers of water
[6:40] that bringeth forth his fruit and his
[6:42] season his leaf also shall not wither
[6:45] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[6:48] man let's just bow our heads and pray
[6:51] lord jesus we thank you for your word we
[6:54] thank you god that you've made a way for
[6:55] us to be here together
[6:57] that we can worship with our brothers
[6:59] and sisters that we can
[7:00] lift our voices in song and praise lord
[7:03] to
[7:03] glorify and magnify your greatness lord
[7:06] as we come now
[7:07] lord to this portion of service where we
[7:10] look to you to break the bread of life
[7:12] we pray god that you would feed us
[7:14] you're the great shepherd may you feed
[7:15] us from your hand lord
[7:17] may we not see a man but may the man
[7:19] fade out of the picture lord and may we
[7:21] see you coming down
[7:22] through a vessel of clay and ministering
[7:24] your word to your children
[7:26] maybe take that word and grow by it lord
[7:28] and become all that you want us to be in
[7:30] this day
[7:31] may the word bring on flesh and may that
[7:34] flesh be
[7:35] bring a manifestation in our lives that
[7:37] all may see
[7:39] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[7:42] you can be seated man
[7:45] as you're seated i just want to share a
[7:47] testimony with you
[7:49] i got uh two letters in the mail today
[7:53] and i just got them this afternoon and
[7:55] uh many of you remember
[7:57] levi yoder the amish man that
[8:01] ezra had met and witnessed too and who
[8:04] had received the message and
[8:05] he's over in holmes county
[8:09] and then annie his stepdaughter who
[8:11] we've been corresponding with and many
[8:13] of you know
[8:14] the saga that's been unfolding over the
[8:16] last year or two actually more than that
[8:18] more than two years
[8:19] with that and i've got a letter from
[8:21] each of them today and i want to read
[8:23] that to you
[8:24] and he's going to share a testimony
[8:26] because of the situation
[8:28] she wasn't permitted to live with her
[8:29] parents levi is her stepfather
[8:31] and then his wife is her mother and they
[8:34] wouldn't allow her she's 24 years old
[8:35] but they wouldn't allow her to go home
[8:37] and she asked us to pray about that
[8:39] she'd been praying about it and last
[8:40] time angie and i were there
[8:41] we prayed with her about that so she
[8:44] writes this in as a testimony
[8:46] she said hey brothers and sisters you
[8:48] have prayed me out of the prison of
[8:49] separation
[8:51] on friday august 21st 2020 at 1 pm
[8:55] this barrier was removed by the power of
[8:57] god
[8:58] dad met his probation officer on friday
[9:01] he told dad i am allowed to be here
[9:03] praise the lord the lord has heard each
[9:05] and every one of your prayers
[9:07] what man tries to make impossible the
[9:09] lord will make possible
[9:11] praise the lord hallelujah amen
[9:14] praise be to god
[9:22] goes on to say thank you to every one of
[9:24] you for praying for me
[9:25] may god bless you i have always believed
[9:28] that i will be here before my parents
[9:30] move into the new house
[9:32] i told mom like that and then she asked
[9:34] you think so
[9:35] i answered yes i will be here
[9:39] if you believe and do not doubt in your
[9:40] heart then it will come to pass
[9:42] praise the lord chad angie next time you
[9:46] come you will meet us together in our
[9:48] new house probably in september
[9:51] i can't wait to meet you once again mom
[9:54] and dad are in the main part of the new
[9:55] house and i am upstairs in my room
[9:57] in the new house today i am blessed to
[10:00] be with my parents after being separated
[10:02] for 11 months three weeks
[10:04] the good lord had a wonderful plan for
[10:06] me praise
[10:07] the lord amen god has turned her
[10:11] mourning into gladness
[10:13] then also in the in the same envelope i
[10:15] had a letter from
[10:17] brother levi this is a tremendous
[10:19] testimony as well
[10:20] but he starts off by in this portion i'm
[10:22] going to read starts off by saying
[10:24] annie is upstairs singing songs and thus
[10:26] cheering the atmosphere
[10:30] such a great blessing we are listening
[10:33] to the messages most every day and
[10:34] sometimes twice a day
[10:36] remember we snuck in a little uh tablet
[10:40] and uh we slipped it in and we we
[10:43] slipped in a
[10:44] backup battery pack and a bottom of a
[10:46] can of popcorn so he wouldn't get caught
[10:49] and so this has been a lot of fun
[10:51] smuggling
[10:53] message material into the amish
[10:54] community
[10:56] praise be to god anyways he says
[10:59] thus cheering the atmosphere is such a
[11:01] great blessing we are listening to the
[11:02] messages
[11:03] most every day and sometimes twice a day
[11:06] these messages are of great
[11:07] encouragement to us in this time of
[11:09] preparation
[11:10] the battle is on chad you have stood by
[11:13] me so humbly
[11:14] encouraging me to stay with the church
[11:16] stay with the church in flesh
[11:18] so that the spirit can witness through
[11:20] me i deeply appreciate you for that
[11:23] lately things surfaced to the point
[11:24] where i was invited to attend a
[11:26] ministerial meeting
[11:28] so that so that all the bishops of our
[11:30] churches could hear my complaint
[11:33] these are from three communities in ohio
[11:35] and two in new york
[11:39] in their mind this was to humble me so i
[11:41] would quit
[11:42] talking about god's word and just do and
[11:44] believe what they say
[11:46] well guess what christ won the victory
[11:51] said satan used my own parents to try to
[11:53] shut me up
[11:54] but all to no avail in front of
[11:56] approximately 10 or 12 bishops and
[11:58] preachers
[11:59] i pled my cause by god's word
[12:02] one preacher tried to push the cause by
[12:05] bringing up some things i had said
[12:07] concerning my faith in baptism the bible
[12:09] way and laying on of hands praying for
[12:12] the sick
[12:13] i was prompted by god to quote the
[12:14] scripture for this
[12:16] and telling them that i've seen the sick
[12:18] get healed and have experienced it on my
[12:20] own body numerous times
[12:22] god was just using this rare opportunity
[12:24] to witness to the blind
[12:26] spiritually blind after i stepped
[12:28] outside they
[12:29] counseled over the matter for several
[12:31] hours
[12:33] in the end they adjusted some of their
[12:35] views on the subject we had come
[12:36] together for and they never again
[12:39] mentioned my faith concerning baptism
[12:40] and healing praise
[12:42] be the god i have nothing but god's word
[12:46] and i need nothing else
[12:48] praise god praise god all ye
[12:51] brethren praise the god
[12:54] that is a wonderful wonderful testimony
[12:57] our brother has been his eyes have been
[12:59] open he's been enlightened to the
[13:00] message and
[13:01] now when he was in the face of trouble
[13:03] he stood upon the word
[13:05] and they could not fight the word praise
[13:09] god
[13:09] so i appreciate your prayers for levi no
[13:12] doubt that things are coming to a head
[13:14] i doubt that he'll be able to stay you
[13:16] know in that church forever for maybe
[13:19] not even very much longer
[13:21] but praise be to god there must be
[13:23] somebody there that's got to hear
[13:24] something
[13:25] because he's been in there longer than i
[13:27] expected and they keep bringing
[13:29] they keep bringing it around to
[13:31] conversations and discussions
[13:33] but guess what he god keeps him there
[13:37] and he keeps giving them the word and
[13:39] then they have nothing to say
[13:41] and i praise god it's wonderful when the
[13:43] word of god shuts up
[13:44] those who are making accusations you
[13:46] don't have to defend yourself you don't
[13:47] defile you don't
[13:48] argue all you have to do is quote the
[13:49] scriptures praise be to god
[13:52] amen we're still believing for his
[13:54] wife's healing
[13:55] she's still in a wheelchair and i'm just
[13:58] trusting god to raise her up for his
[14:00] glory
[14:01] for a manifestation that will further
[14:03] open the eyes of many that are blind
[14:05] and cause them to love the word as levi
[14:08] loves the word
[14:09] so pray for us we're going to try to
[14:11] head over there we weren't able to visit
[14:13] they've had
[14:14] crews some amish crews working there for
[14:16] several months
[14:17] since i believe it was may or june
[14:20] working on the house
[14:21] but he says all is getting finished now
[14:23] in the next week
[14:24] and he's inviting us to come out so pray
[14:26] for us as we go out
[14:27] and levi with his new home
[14:30] where he's situated is far away from
[14:33] everybody in his church he used to watch
[14:35] him
[14:36] they used to spy on him amen and he's in
[14:38] a better situation
[14:39] and he wants to open his house and start
[14:41] having bible studies inviting his
[14:43] friends
[14:43] and his family to start having bible
[14:45] studies so pray for us that god will
[14:47] make a way and whatever god once done
[14:49] will happen
[14:50] but we certainly are encouraged by that
[14:52] and we want to be there
[14:53] amen and if if there's one more soul to
[14:55] come out we want to be there
[14:57] if not we just want to testify the truth
[14:59] anyhow
[15:00] for all to hear so that everybody has a
[15:03] chance
[15:04] amen so be praying for that
[15:07] amen so we we read here in the book of
[15:09] psalm which we've read this
[15:10] i think a couple weeks ago a couple
[15:12] services ago that this man who delights
[15:15] in the law of the lord and meditates on
[15:17] his law
[15:18] day and night he shall be like a tree
[15:20] planted by the rivers of water
[15:22] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[15:24] season his leaf also shall not wither
[15:26] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[15:29] brother takes this scripture in one
[15:30] place
[15:31] and he makes this his he says this man
[15:34] shall be like a tree planted by the
[15:36] rivers of water what man the one who
[15:38] delights in the law of the lord the one
[15:40] who
[15:40] meditates on the law day and night he
[15:42] says he shall be like
[15:43] a tree planted by the rivers of water
[15:46] that bringeth forth his fruit and
[15:47] brother branham injects god's fruit
[15:50] not the man's fruit but this man who's
[15:52] planted by these rivers of water shall
[15:53] bring forth god's fruit
[15:56] in in the season his leaf also shall not
[15:58] wither and whoso
[15:59] what and whatsoever he doeth shall
[16:02] prosper
[16:03] let's turn over to proverbs 11 and read
[16:06] one scripture over there
[16:24] proverbs 11 verse 30 the fruit of the
[16:27] righteous
[16:28] is a tree of life that's a big statement
[16:32] because we know what the tree of the
[16:33] life is the tree of life is christ the
[16:36] tree of life brings eternal life the
[16:37] tree of life is christ
[16:39] but here they're saying the fruit of the
[16:41] righteous is a tree of life
[16:43] this man who meditates on the law day
[16:45] and night he'll be like a tree planted
[16:47] by the river's water that will bring
[16:48] forth his fruit god's fruit
[16:50] in due season and his leaf shall not
[16:52] wither
[16:53] and now the fruit of the righteous is a
[16:55] tree of life
[16:56] and as we speak i want to talk about the
[16:59] dwelling places in the new jerusalem and
[17:01] there's a quote that brother branham
[17:02] mentions here in a minute that i really
[17:03] want to
[17:04] hone in on and i want to talk about but
[17:06] i want to look at this tree of life
[17:08] because as we begin to look
[17:10] through the scriptures we find out that
[17:12] that
[17:13] you know we know the book of genesis in
[17:15] the book of revelations or book of
[17:16] symbols
[17:17] we have trees in genesis we have we have
[17:19] tree of life in the book of revelations
[17:21] and these symbolize something and god is
[17:23] trying to tell us something
[17:25] through the symbols because remember
[17:26] he's hidden the truth
[17:28] in the book amen this is a great mystery
[17:31] that's been
[17:32] through this whole bible and the whole
[17:33] mystery has been spelled out through the
[17:35] bible
[17:36] but it's been spelled out in mystery
[17:38] form so that at the end of time he could
[17:40] come
[17:41] through a prophetic gift and he could
[17:42] begin to reveal to us the mysteries that
[17:45] are laying in the book
[17:46] amen and part of the way he does that is
[17:48] by interpreting the symbols to us
[17:51] so we we praise god that now we see the
[17:54] fruit of the righteous is a tree of life
[17:56] and you have to ask yourself how many
[17:57] trees of life are there
[18:01] amen how many trees of life are there
[18:04] and i would i would say it this way
[18:06] there is a tree of life
[18:09] but that tree of life i'm i'm not gonna
[18:12] i'm not going to even try to guess
[18:14] how many representations there are of
[18:16] that tree of life but there was one tree
[18:18] of life
[18:19] just like there is one christ
[18:22] but we know christ's body is many many
[18:25] one christ but his body is many
[18:28] praise god and so how many trees of life
[18:32] well the fruit of the righteous is a
[18:33] tree of life
[18:35] amen so praise god i don't think the
[18:38] bible is referring to
[18:39] another tree of life or that there's an
[18:41] alternate treat of life
[18:42] or that you can either have christ the
[18:44] tree of life or the fruit of
[18:46] righteousness
[18:47] of the the fruit of the righteous can be
[18:48] another tree of life so that now you
[18:50] have two paths
[18:52] to eternal life but it's the same thing
[18:56] in another manifestation it's the same
[18:58] thing in another form
[18:59] it's the same thing in another
[19:00] expression
[19:03] let's go to revelation 21.
[19:11] that's why you know i'm so thankful that
[19:14] god sent a messenger in this day
[19:17] because i grew up in church from the
[19:19] time i was probably two or three weeks
[19:21] old
[19:21] through my entire life i probably never
[19:23] missed more than two weeks worth of
[19:25] services in my whole life
[19:27] i was faithful to go to church and
[19:29] taught in sunday school
[19:30] and all the things that you normally
[19:32] have in church amen but but i learned
[19:35] the bible
[19:35] as symbols i learned the old testament
[19:38] as stories
[19:39] but god came and he took all those
[19:42] pieces that were laying there
[19:43] and they were disjointed and they were
[19:45] separated and they were they were puzzle
[19:46] pieces but i didn't know they were
[19:48] puzzle pieces and they were laying all
[19:49] over the table
[19:50] but god brought a prophet in our day to
[19:52] show you the picture and start putting
[19:53] the pieces of the puzzle together
[19:55] these aren't stories there's one story
[19:58] these aren't old testament stories amen
[20:00] these aren't new testament this isn't
[20:02] new testament history
[20:03] this is one story one goal one purpose
[20:06] god had
[20:07] and the whole bible is explaining one
[20:09] mystery one
[20:10] mystery purpose that he had one thing
[20:13] god wanted to achieve in the whole bible
[20:16] i so enjoyed sunday's service with
[20:18] brother aaron here you know i sat in my
[20:20] seat and just
[20:21] fed and fed and fed amen because it's
[20:23] exactly
[20:24] it's exactly the truth amen it's not
[20:27] it's not
[20:27] this you know genesis account here
[20:29] revelations account here
[20:31] the genesis and revelation account go
[20:32] right here
[20:34] what seed was sown there comes the
[20:35] fruition over here what started there
[20:38] comes the full manifestation at the end
[20:39] of the book
[20:41] so we don't separate these things out
[20:44] and we understand that god speaks to us
[20:46] many times in symbols and in metaphors
[20:48] and giving examples that
[20:50] that point to a greater truth
[20:53] and so i grew up all my life thinking
[20:55] that someday
[20:56] if i'm good and god is good to me that
[20:59] i'll be able to walk up to a literal
[21:00] tree and pluck a piece of fruit off of
[21:02] that little tree
[21:04] and eat that fruit and somehow have
[21:06] eternal life
[21:08] but then through the message i realized
[21:10] i can eat of that tree
[21:12] now i don't have to wait that tree is
[21:15] here that tree is available
[21:16] there's fruit on that tree and then we
[21:19] can come to the tree of life and eat of
[21:21] the tree of life
[21:22] and have eternal life
[21:25] i don't have to wait to go find the tree
[21:28] and for the the tree to be restored in a
[21:31] physical way
[21:32] amen and and and hope that someday i can
[21:35] get there and someday i can eat it amen
[21:37] i'm here i'm in in the presence of the
[21:39] tree and can eat of that tree
[21:45] it's like the new jerusalem
[21:48] oh i want to go to that city friends i'm
[21:51] in that city
[21:54] i'm looking at that city amen there's a
[21:56] reflection of that
[21:58] city on the earth amen and if you see
[22:00] the reflection you better understand the
[22:02] city
[22:02] it's an easier way to understand the
[22:04] city by understanding the reflection
[22:07] so so so many things that we put off in
[22:10] the future are kick down the road
[22:12] amen i i i don't want anybody to ever
[22:15] misunderstand what i'm saying when i say
[22:17] that because it's so easy to be
[22:19] misunderstood
[22:20] i'm not saying that i don't want a
[22:22] physical manifestation
[22:23] i want to live in that city at the end
[22:26] of the millennium
[22:28] i want amen i want in the millennial
[22:30] reign to see
[22:31] christ sit on the throne of david in a
[22:33] physical form that i can see
[22:35] in my physical form i long for that
[22:38] i'm looking forward to that amen but i'm
[22:40] not going to just sit on my heels amen
[22:43] and long for the day that someday i see
[22:45] that i'm seeing the representation of it
[22:47] now
[22:48] i'm experiencing the reality of it now
[22:50] amen
[22:51] all that is is a further unfolding of
[22:53] what he's doing now
[22:55] what he's doing now will further unfold
[22:57] in the millennium what he does in the
[22:58] millennium will further
[23:00] unfold amen in eternity after the
[23:02] millennium
[23:03] it's just a further expression of
[23:05] further unfolding of the same thing we
[23:07] have here today
[23:10] so how amen how uh
[23:13] how wonderful it is that god has been so
[23:16] good to us
[23:16] amen to take away sunday school stories
[23:19] and give us reality
[23:20] to take away the carrot at the end of
[23:22] the stick amen
[23:23] and all christianity is following the
[23:25] carrot at the end of the stick
[23:26] if i'm good and do good someday i'll get
[23:29] to eat that carrot
[23:31] and all christians let around amen
[23:33] hoping to eat the carrots someday
[23:35] friends amen forget it i'm eating from
[23:37] the tree of life amen
[23:39] the food is here amen the life is here
[23:42] christ is here
[23:45] praise be to god so don't take these
[23:48] things and shelf them over here or put
[23:50] them back there
[23:51] bring everything today amen today is the
[23:54] day
[23:55] if we experience it today amen it's a
[23:58] guarantee you'll experience it that day
[24:01] if you miss it today you'll miss it that
[24:03] day
[24:06] revelation 21
[24:13] verse 9
[24:17] and there came unto me one of the seven
[24:18] angels which had the seven vials full of
[24:20] the seven last plagues
[24:21] and talked with me saying come hither i
[24:24] will show thee the bride
[24:26] the lamb's wife and he carried me away
[24:28] in the spirit to the great high mountain
[24:30] and showed me that great city the holy
[24:32] jerusalem descending out of heaven from
[24:34] god
[24:35] having the glory of god and it was like
[24:38] her light was like unto a stone most
[24:40] precious even like a jasper stone
[24:42] clear as crystal man i was i enjoyed
[24:45] aaron reading that
[24:46] on sunday because it was already in my
[24:47] notes for tonight
[24:50] amen but but
[24:53] now this this angel is going to show
[24:57] john the lamb's wife so when john turns
[25:01] to see the lamb's wife
[25:03] he sees the city
[25:07] then let's go uh further to 22.
[25:15] and one within that city he begins to
[25:18] show him things that are in the city
[25:19] revelation 22 and 1 and he showed me a
[25:21] pure river of water of life
[25:23] clearest crystal proceeding out of the
[25:25] throne of god and of the lamb
[25:27] and in the midst of the street of it on
[25:28] either side of the river was there the
[25:30] tree of life
[25:31] which bear 12 men are fruits and yielded
[25:33] her fruit every month
[25:35] and the leaves of the tree were for the
[25:36] healing of the nations
[25:39] so when we look at this scripture now
[25:42] uh we've been through this several times
[25:44] but in this city when he when he goes to
[25:46] see the lamb
[25:47] he sees the city when he
[25:50] when he when he wants to when he when he
[25:52] goes to see the bride of the lamb when
[25:54] he goes to see the lamb's wife
[25:55] amen he shows him the new jerusalem so
[25:58] the new jerusalem
[25:59] is an expression of the lamb's wife and
[26:02] the lamb's wife is an expression of the
[26:04] new jerusalem
[26:05] so the two go together why do the two go
[26:08] together because scripture put them
[26:10] together
[26:11] if you want to see the new jerusalem
[26:13] look at the lamb's wife
[26:15] if you want to see the lamb's wife look
[26:17] at the new jerusalem amen they're the
[26:19] expression of the same thing
[26:22] praise god so now
[26:25] now with that in mind let's let's keep
[26:27] looking at this subject
[26:29] brother bam says in the future home the
[26:32] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[26:33] bride he said oh holy mountain
[26:35] there will be streets of transparent
[26:37] gold avenues and houses and parks
[26:39] if you want to read this revelation 21
[26:41] 18 the tree of life will be there
[26:43] 12 different manners of fruit one each
[26:45] month will be born
[26:47] on it the people that eat these fruits
[26:49] they'll change their diet
[26:50] every month now if you look in the
[26:54] scripture
[26:54] and when it talks about this in verse 2
[26:56] it said in the midst of the street
[26:57] on either side of the river was there
[26:59] the tree of life which bear 12 manner of
[27:02] fruits
[27:02] and yielded her fruit every month so
[27:05] this tree
[27:06] is referred to in the feminine but we
[27:08] know that the tree of life is christ
[27:11] but here it's referred to in the
[27:13] feminine amen because christ
[27:14] also has a feminine side christ is known
[27:17] as masculine and feminine
[27:21] amen so brother bram says all the way
[27:25] back in 1957
[27:27] and questions and answers on hebrews he
[27:29] says there's even a tree in there and
[27:31] the tree on
[27:32] either side bears 12 man or a fruit and
[27:34] they yield their fruit once a month
[27:36] which is 12 months in the year they rent
[27:39] they render 12
[27:40] manner of fruit every year as it goes by
[27:43] 12 is that worship number you see
[27:46] so he says there's 12 men or a few
[27:48] there's 12 months in the year
[27:50] and 12 is a worship number amen and we
[27:52] realize that the term
[27:54] worship amen is not the same term as
[27:56] praise
[27:58] praise means to shout forth or declare
[28:00] or it comes from a root word that means
[28:02] to shoot an arrow
[28:03] amen to sing something out or say
[28:04] something out or to sing praises to the
[28:06] lord
[28:06] but worship means to bow down
[28:10] so worship is the act of submission or
[28:12] reverence
[28:13] to to deity or to a king amen is this
[28:16] term worship
[28:17] so worship has a manifestation to it or
[28:20] worship has
[28:20] fruit what is the fruit of worship the
[28:23] fruit of worship
[28:24] is obedience to the word a fruit of
[28:28] worship
[28:29] amen for instance cain and abel both
[28:31] brought worship
[28:34] and both of their worship brought fruit
[28:36] but one fruit was rejected
[28:38] and the other fruit of worship was
[28:39] received because one
[28:41] came by revelation of the word and one
[28:43] came by self-will
[28:44] amen but but both of these worshippers
[28:47] were bringing forth worship
[28:48] and their worship was manifest in what
[28:50] they did
[28:52] and the manifestation was the fruit of
[28:54] their worship and one was rejected
[28:56] because it was the wrong kind of fruit
[28:57] and one was receded because it was the
[28:58] right kind of fruit
[29:00] so here we find that that these 12 men
[29:03] are a fruit
[29:03] amen they represent they represent
[29:05] worship or true worship or perfect
[29:07] worship amen which
[29:08] is not ever expressed in self-will
[29:12] is always expressed in a total
[29:14] submission
[29:15] to god and god is his word
[29:18] so there will be a tree that bears fruit
[29:21] all the time
[29:23] and it's wonderful to note it's not just
[29:25] one manner of fruit
[29:27] but there's a continual fruit we can say
[29:30] it this way and this is just me this is
[29:32] just brother chad
[29:33] but there's a perpetual bearing of the
[29:36] fruit
[29:37] a consistent constant in season bearing
[29:39] fruit
[29:40] there's never a month there's never a
[29:42] change in the calendar there's never a
[29:44] period of time
[29:45] that there's not fruit on this tree
[29:47] which means that that this
[29:49] this this this tree this tree of life
[29:51] that's here
[29:52] amen is a constantly bearing of fruit i
[29:55] mean it's not all the same amen
[29:57] it's fruit at church and it's fruit at
[29:59] home and it's fruit at work and it's
[30:01] fruit when you're alone and it's fruit
[30:03] for every season and manner of life
[30:05] it's not one-sided it's not hypocritical
[30:07] it doesn't have
[30:08] gaps in it amen so many times
[30:12] you know even in our christian walk
[30:13] through time if we look if we look
[30:15] through our history we can find gaps
[30:18] in our bearing of fruit i was good at
[30:20] church and i was good at
[30:22] home amen but i began to struggle at
[30:23] school
[30:25] i was good here good here i struggled
[30:26] here amen
[30:28] but but this is a tree that is going to
[30:30] bear every month amen
[30:32] consistently bearing fruit non-stop
[30:35] every month
[30:36] consistently it doesn't go through a dry
[30:38] time it doesn't go through an empty
[30:40] spell
[30:41] it doesn't go through any time of
[30:43] barrenness but she's going to bring
[30:45] forth the fruit
[30:46] of the word constantly amen in a perfect
[30:49] worship back to
[30:50] god again and again and again and again
[30:53] and she's going to do it in honesty and
[30:54] integrity and every
[30:56] manner of operation is going to be fruit
[30:59] every obstacle every trial
[31:01] going to be fruit this is a tree of life
[31:04] amen is going to be bearing the fruit of
[31:06] life
[31:08] this is the quote that i want to hone in
[31:10] on and pay close attention to
[31:12] here for the next little bit and this is
[31:14] what triggered a lot of my thinking
[31:16] in the future home he says on this
[31:18] throne on top of it 1500 miles high
[31:21] the whole world will see the light of
[31:23] the world jesus sitting on the throne
[31:25] on top of the world top of the church
[31:28] top of mount zion which is 1500 miles
[31:31] half the size of the united states
[31:32] and raises plumb up until you can see
[31:34] him the world over 1500 miles high
[31:37] now miller venom is talking in very real
[31:41] measurements amen
[31:42] and very real uh uh measurements and and
[31:46] and space and things like that but let's
[31:49] bring this right back home now to where
[31:50] we are now
[31:51] because when brother brandon preach
[31:52] future home you know well because i told
[31:54] you
[31:55] brother branham draws an analogy in
[31:57] future home and he's showing the future
[31:59] you know 1500 miles square at the base
[32:02] and going up 1500 miles there's going to
[32:04] be a physical mountain rise up out of
[32:05] the earth and a city dwell over it
[32:07] but he says i can drop a little
[32:09] something here
[32:12] he says that's about the dimensions we
[32:14] got right here
[32:15] now he's talking about in the church one
[32:18] from maine
[32:19] down to arkansas one from here in canada
[32:21] over to the coast
[32:22] he said it's about what we have here
[32:25] showing that that
[32:26] city that's there is represented on
[32:28] earth
[32:30] so that's so on top of mount zion
[32:33] amen where is the light of the lamb
[32:36] shining to the whole world
[32:37] today where is it today friend don't
[32:40] tell me where it's going to be
[32:41] amen a thousand years from now or more
[32:44] but where is that light shining now
[32:46] that light is on top of the mountain
[32:47] amen it's on top of mount zion
[32:49] and where is the top of mount zion it's
[32:52] the bright age friends
[32:53] on top of the seven church ages the
[32:55] capstone is coming down
[32:56] he himself has united with his bride and
[32:59] it's the lamb
[33:00] enthroned in her
[33:03] and that's the light of the whole world
[33:06] there is no
[33:07] other light for this world amen
[33:10] it is life it's the top of the city it's
[33:12] the top of mount zion
[33:14] it's the top of the church ages
[33:18] it is him and her united as one and now
[33:21] he is reflecting himself down through
[33:23] her
[33:25] through the whole city because it's all
[33:27] the truth it's all the character it's
[33:29] everything that's been built up through
[33:30] the entire new testament church
[33:33] now on full display where is the light
[33:36] of the world
[33:38] on top of mount zion who is the light of
[33:40] the world
[33:41] the lamb jesus christ himself
[33:44] is he on his throne yes is his light
[33:48] shining
[33:49] yes is the light shining in darkness
[33:52] every much is so is with shining the day
[33:54] that light came to the earth
[33:56] and they were so stuck in darkness they
[33:58] refused to receive the light
[34:00] not a physical light not a light you can
[34:03] see not a light that's widely accepted
[34:05] or recognized as light
[34:07] because when jesus was here he was not
[34:08] widely accepted and not recognized as
[34:10] light but he said i am the light of the
[34:12] world
[34:14] and i am the life i am the light
[34:18] and i am the life
[34:22] and i want to say friends on top of
[34:23] mount zion he's here
[34:26] the light is here the life is here
[34:28] outside of that
[34:29] light is darkness
[34:34] the city is reflected here on earth the
[34:37] light is here
[34:39] so now we we've gotten our minds in the
[34:42] right spot
[34:43] brother brennan's preaching future home
[34:45] i'd like to say just as in my own way of
[34:47] thinking
[34:48] my own understanding amen brother man's
[34:50] preaching future home
[34:51] not to get us excited about something
[34:53] that will come someday
[34:55] but brother branham is preaching future
[34:57] home to get you to recognize what is
[34:59] today
[35:00] what is here amen and what is here is
[35:02] showing what will be
[35:04] and what will be is known by what is
[35:09] so i'm in the same quote in future home
[35:12] and all up and down here will be the
[35:15] redeemed
[35:16] there will be the houses of pure gold
[35:19] listen i don't care about a house of
[35:23] gold
[35:26] you understand gold represents deity
[35:31] deity tabernacled in flesh and one day
[35:33] this flesh is going to be changing the
[35:35] body like his own glorious body
[35:37] and it will be pure gold amen when we
[35:39] get a glorified body
[35:41] that will be your house of pure gold
[35:45] right now the holy ghost is sanctifying
[35:48] cleaning this house so that he can live
[35:49] in it but this is not yet the house of
[35:51] pure gold but i've got a house of pure
[35:53] gold coming amen it's not one that's got
[35:55] a couch and a sofa and something i'm
[35:56] going to sit and amen it's a body it's a
[35:59] body
[35:59] where my atoms have changed been made
[36:01] like into his own glorious body
[36:05] houses of pure gold there will be
[36:07] avenues and parks
[36:09] and gardens and the river of life come
[36:12] trickling out of the throne and running
[36:14] down through little chasms and
[36:16] over every terrace and listen to this
[36:19] and the tree of life will be blooming in
[36:22] every yard
[36:30] you know what i don't think brother
[36:32] branham's misquoting the bible or trying
[36:33] to add to the bible
[36:34] i think he's trying to get us to
[36:36] understand a picture he's painting a
[36:38] picture
[36:39] you say where did he get that in the
[36:40] bible i didn't see that in the bible
[36:41] every yard amen
[36:42] he's a prophet of god he's trying to get
[36:44] you to see something
[36:47] he said the the there would be parks and
[36:50] gardens
[36:51] what is this this is a recreation of the
[36:54] garden of eden
[36:56] the city is the garden the gardens in
[36:58] the city amen he's in the garden
[37:03] amen like aaron was sharing with us on
[37:05] sunday amen
[37:06] god amen the first work he did was make
[37:09] a garden amen
[37:10] eastwood and eden mean the beginning or
[37:12] at the start of eating made a garden and
[37:13] he put the man in the garden and here
[37:15] once again he's got a city that's a
[37:16] garden
[37:17] and the man is in the garden
[37:21] and the river of life flowing down it's
[37:23] a well-watered land
[37:26] from the throne it's watering down
[37:29] trickling down through every terrace and
[37:31] every chasm
[37:32] that means every part of this bride is
[37:34] well watered
[37:37] and the tree of life will be blooming in
[37:40] every
[37:41] yard
[37:44] and bear its fruits 12 times a year a
[37:47] changing fruit
[37:48] every month so i want to focus on this
[37:51] the tree of life will be blooming in
[37:53] every yard
[37:54] amen that means amen in my house
[37:58] in front of my house there should be a
[37:59] tree of life blooming
[38:01] that means if that image is supposed to
[38:03] be reflected here that means in my yard
[38:06] there should be a tree of life blooming
[38:07] now friends
[38:09] there should be something amen declaring
[38:11] the very life of the tree of life
[38:13] is present on the earth now because in
[38:15] my yard if i'm going to have a yard
[38:17] there
[38:17] with a tree of life blooming then i've
[38:19] got to have a place here
[38:20] with the tree of life blooming in my
[38:22] yard
[38:25] praise be to god listen this is not the
[38:27] day for partial
[38:29] that was church ages dip in the holy
[38:31] ghost partial outpouring
[38:33] partial understanding partial partial
[38:35] partial ad
[38:36] ad amen it's all been added amen it's
[38:38] all been poured back in
[38:40] it's all been given back so this is not
[38:43] the time of partial this is the time of
[38:44] full manifestation
[38:49] so the tree of life will be blooming in
[38:51] every yard
[38:52] when i read that i said oh god let the
[38:54] tree of life bloom in my yard
[38:56] let it be blooming now in my yard lord
[39:00] he says in the restoration of the bride
[39:02] tree from 1962
[39:04] the first thing he did is he destroyed
[39:06] god's first precious fruit tree christ
[39:09] he was the tree from the garden of eden
[39:11] that's right
[39:12] the first the first fruit tree he
[39:15] destroyed it
[39:16] first one god planted here on earth was
[39:18] christ he destroyed that tree that was
[39:20] bearing his fruit
[39:21] now they had all kinds of organizations
[39:24] and he just had that in his hands but
[39:26] when he come to that tree that bore the
[39:27] actual fruit that roman bug got in there
[39:30] see
[39:30] destroyed the tree the tree yes jesus
[39:33] said
[39:34] in saint john if i do not the works of
[39:35] my father i have not the fruits of my
[39:37] father don't believe me
[39:39] he was bearing the fruit of god he
[39:42] was the tree from the garden he was the
[39:45] tree of life
[39:46] amen in rome cut him down and hung him
[39:48] on a tree
[39:50] and he says he destroyed that he's the
[39:53] tree that was destroyed
[39:54] all the way back from the from he was
[39:56] the tree from the garden of eden that
[39:58] had been destroyed
[40:00] and if you look in genesis 3 14 i'll
[40:03] just read it to you
[40:04] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[40:06] because thou has done this
[40:07] thou art cursed above all cattle and
[40:09] above every beast of the field upon thy
[40:11] belly shalt thou go and dust shalt i eat
[40:13] all the days of thy life
[40:14] and i will put enmity between thee and
[40:16] the woman and between thy seed and her
[40:18] seed
[40:19] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[40:21] bruise his heel
[40:23] so all the way back after the fall god
[40:26] planted a seed of his word showing that
[40:29] there would be a seed of a woman that
[40:30] would come forth and it was planted
[40:32] all the way back from the garden of eden
[40:34] and all through the old testament that
[40:36] seed of the tree of life
[40:38] grew grew through the prophets grew
[40:40] through the psalms and probably grew all
[40:41] the way up
[40:43] until it come into full fruit bearing
[40:46] and what did they do to that tree
[40:47] they cut it down and hung it on a cross
[40:49] and out from that tree
[40:50] came another tree and that was a bride
[40:52] tree amen but the roman bug got into
[40:55] that tree
[40:55] in the first age and began to eat the
[40:57] fruit and then eat the leaves
[40:59] and then eat the bark and then suck the
[41:01] sap
[41:02] but he said i will restore saith the
[41:04] lord all that the cankerworm palmer worm
[41:07] caterpillar locusts have eaten
[41:08] i will restore saith the lord because
[41:10] there was a seed planted in genesis from
[41:13] eden that grew up
[41:14] amen then the romans destroyed that and
[41:16] then he brought forth the bride tree
[41:18] and the roman bug destroyed that but
[41:20] he's going to have one in the last day
[41:22] that's a restored bride tree that will
[41:24] not be destroyed by rome amen because
[41:27] rome
[41:27] the veil has been taken away and rome
[41:29] cannot deceive her anymore
[41:33] no more deception like in the garden no
[41:35] more deception like in the first age
[41:37] because he's he's opened the book he's
[41:39] loose to seal
[41:40] the mystery of god's mind is revealed
[41:42] like never before on this earth
[41:45] and what did he reveal the seal why did
[41:47] he break the seal and unlock the mystery
[41:49] amen so that this bride won't be
[41:51] deceived she's predestinated not to be
[41:54] deceived so he sent a word
[41:56] amen because she was deceived by words
[41:59] he brought a word that will stop
[42:00] deception
[42:03] remember in the beginning the woman was
[42:05] deceived by words
[42:08] and the first church age she was
[42:09] deceived by words
[42:12] doctrines and teachings
[42:16] so he came and he gave us his whole mind
[42:21] so that we can't be deceived any longer
[42:23] by words
[42:25] because he gave us his word
[42:30] that's why if we just stick with the
[42:32] word
[42:34] we won't be deceived not try to
[42:37] manipulate into it just stick with it
[42:39] and as god reveals it and opens it and
[42:41] you see it and it's there and it's
[42:43] playing just stay with the word
[42:47] see he said in the end time evangelism
[42:50] from 1962 he said looky here
[42:52] remember my message recently on the
[42:54] bride tree how they took
[42:56] jesus he was the tree the one that david
[42:58] saw a tree planted by the rivers of
[43:00] water
[43:00] his fruit and season the most perfect
[43:02] tree and they cut him down and hung him
[43:04] on a man-made roman tree for a mockery
[43:07] but what did he do rose up again on the
[43:09] third day what else did he do
[43:11] he set forth a bride tree a man and a
[43:13] woman like the trees that was in the
[43:14] garden of eden two trees
[43:17] one of them the tree of life one of them
[43:19] the tree of death and what did he do
[43:20] he come to redeem this tree so since he
[43:23] redeemed it at calvary he's ready to
[43:25] plant
[43:26] her now oh my i get the feeling
[43:28] religious when you say that see
[43:29] to restore his bride tree the one that
[43:32] should have been in eden
[43:33] but she fell there because she
[43:35] disbelieved the word
[43:37] but here he's going to restore a tree
[43:39] that will believe the word
[43:41] and when she come up on the day of
[43:43] pentecost that original doctrine that
[43:45] original faith
[43:46] then what did the rome begin to do send
[43:48] a cankerworm send a palmer room and each
[43:50] one took as part of the
[43:51] of the fruit the leaves and everything
[43:53] and sucked it all down
[43:55] but what did the prophet saw that he
[43:57] said but i will restore that tree saith
[43:59] the lord
[44:00] she started back in the reformation what
[44:02] did she do organized
[44:04] god pruned her right in saint john 14
[44:06] cut all the organization off of it and
[44:08] she came back to wesley
[44:09] she organized pruned her off but i will
[44:11] restore
[44:13] she's still coming now what does it do
[44:15] in the evening time there will
[44:17] there will be not an organization there
[44:19] will be a top
[44:20] where does the fruit ripen at first in
[44:22] the top why the sun hits it
[44:24] in the evening time the seeds are
[44:26] planted now for the evening time bride
[44:28] tree
[44:29] when the tree of life returns back
[44:32] to the bride tree
[44:36] what was the restoration doing in the
[44:38] reformation it was bringing back the sap
[44:40] it was bringing back the bark it was
[44:42] bringing back the leaves
[44:46] bringing back blooms but in order to
[44:50] bring back fruit
[44:51] you've got to bring back the bridegroom
[44:52] tree
[44:54] and what will it be in the end time he
[44:56] said in the end time
[44:58] what will it be
[45:01] he said when the tree of life returns
[45:04] back
[45:05] to the bride tree you see and the
[45:08] evening lights has come out now to water
[45:10] and ripen that fruit that's been on the
[45:11] tree
[45:12] that's been planted oh praise god
[45:15] this is the day we live in france this
[45:18] is the place where we're at
[45:20] i i say it like this today
[45:23] in this world there is a light there is
[45:26] a light on the throne on top of mount
[45:28] zion
[45:29] in the bride it's the light of the lamb
[45:32] it's god is the light thereof and the
[45:34] lamb is the light thereof
[45:37] but i also want to say that there's a
[45:41] tree of life in every yard
[45:44] bearing the same fruit he bore amen a
[45:47] full manifestation of the full life
[45:49] amen it's to be here in this day and
[45:51] it's to be in every yard
[45:56] that's why
[46:00] when we do the carrot on the stick thing
[46:04] you know it's so detrimental to our
[46:06] christian walk
[46:07] to keep putting things off
[46:10] because you know everything
[46:14] is hanging at the end of the stick we'll
[46:16] call it the golden carrot
[46:20] when i eat that i'll have a ride when i
[46:22] eat that i'll manifest the life when i
[46:24] eat that i'll be perfect when i get
[46:26] there
[46:30] but he's given us the fruit of the tree
[46:33] he's given us all the food we need to
[46:35] overcome in this day
[46:36] he's given us all the food with all the
[46:38] vitamins with all the nutrients with all
[46:40] the substance that we need
[46:41] to be everything he's called for his
[46:43] bride to be in this day
[46:45] we've got to eat on it and become what
[46:47] we eat
[46:48] we've got to feed on the word amen not
[46:51] kick it down
[46:52] not sometime in our mind amen project in
[46:54] the future i'll do
[46:55] in the future i'll overcome in the
[46:57] future today's the day to overcome
[46:59] today's the day to let the tree bloom in
[47:02] your yard
[47:04] god wants it to bloom now that doesn't
[47:07] mean there's not a process we're all in
[47:08] the process
[47:10] there's a process to this god's working
[47:12] us in the process
[47:13] amen but we're all going to be blooming
[47:16] the tree of life will be blooming in
[47:17] every yard
[47:19] in the in the message christ is the
[47:21] mystery of god revealed prophet of god
[47:23] says now remember
[47:24] he is that tree of life contrary to the
[47:26] serpent seed you see
[47:28] he is that seed the woman's seed the
[47:29] tree of life in the garden
[47:31] unless they put forth their hands and
[47:33] move this tree they'd eat that tree and
[47:34] live forever
[47:35] and he's the only tree that can be taken
[47:37] that you can live forever
[47:39] his word is life and that by the word
[47:41] then the word of god which eve turned
[47:43] down in the garden of eden
[47:45] then here is christ the word made
[47:47] manifest
[47:48] and when he come on earth he was the
[47:50] tree of life do you believe that
[47:52] and rome what did they do he had to be
[47:53] chopped down and he was put on a tree of
[47:55] disgrace curses he that hang on a tree
[47:57] became a curse for the human race and
[47:59] now through that
[48:00] through what through calvary and now
[48:02] through that he brings forth a bride
[48:04] tree
[48:05] which will be the tree of life restored
[48:08] back to him
[48:09] as husband and wife in the garden of
[48:10] eden
[48:12] glory to god by the same word and the
[48:15] same god
[48:16] may manifest in husband and wife
[48:19] the same bride tree back again
[48:22] so now at the end time amen the
[48:25] bridegroom tree will come back to the
[48:27] bright tree the tree of life will come
[48:28] back to the bride tree
[48:29] amen and at the same time amen the bride
[48:32] tree will be stored back to the tree of
[48:34] life
[48:35] the two are coming back together again
[48:39] by the same word and the same god made
[48:41] manifest in husband
[48:43] and in wife the same word and same god
[48:45] made manifest in the husband
[48:46] is the same word and same god to be made
[48:48] manifested in the wife
[48:50] let's turn together to isaiah 61.
[48:56] now you may remember isaiah 61 is the
[48:59] scripture that jesus goes into
[49:01] when he goes into the temple one day and
[49:04] he's handed a scroll
[49:07] and he reads part of the verse amen and
[49:10] he closes the scroll and he says this
[49:12] day this scripture is fulfilled
[49:14] in your ears and brother branham comes
[49:17] and
[49:18] he and he preaches um oh
[49:21] what does he preach amen the next sermon
[49:24] he preaches is this day this scripture
[49:26] is fulfilled
[49:26] amen but he but he's preaching on
[49:28] judgment and i can't remember
[49:30] right now when he's preaching it's not
[49:31] choosing of a bride but it's something
[49:32] like that
[49:34] birth pains thank you birth pains he's
[49:36] preaching the sick seals preaching
[49:37] judgment he's preaching birth pains
[49:39] amen and in birth veins he begins to he
[49:41] has this episode where his bible pages
[49:43] of
[49:44] bible stick together a priest comes and
[49:45] hands him his bible amen
[49:47] just replicating the scene that jesus
[49:49] had went through
[49:50] two thousand years ago amen and then
[49:52] brother later the lord tells him amen
[49:55] go back to your bible and then he sees
[49:56] the pages are stuck and
[49:58] he and he takes him to this realization
[50:00] that he just went through exactly what
[50:02] jesus went through but he didn't repeat
[50:04] what jesus repeated
[50:07] he was finishing what jesus left off
[50:12] because he said part of this scripture
[50:13] applies to his first coming
[50:15] and part of the scripture applies to his
[50:17] second coming
[50:18] so when when brother branham when that
[50:20] priest hands him the scroll i mean he
[50:22] reads out of that book and then he
[50:23] begins to
[50:24] preach birth pains he's actually he's
[50:27] actually
[50:28] noting he's actually signifying that
[50:30] we're in the second coming now
[50:33] this is the second coming so isaiah 61
[50:37] verse 1 the spirit of the lord god is
[50:40] upon me because the lord hath anointed
[50:41] me to preach good tidings unto the meek
[50:44] he has sent me to bind up the
[50:45] brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the
[50:48] captives in the opening of the prison to
[50:50] them that are found
[50:51] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[50:53] lord comma
[50:54] this is where jesus stops now when
[50:57] brother branham comes back
[50:59] amen brother batman doesn't come he
[51:01] doesn't come in birth pains and read
[51:03] any of this verse
[51:06] but he preaches the message birth pains
[51:09] which is
[51:09] finishing what jesus didn't finish and
[51:12] later god shows him that that's what
[51:14] that's
[51:14] this is what this is for that jesus had
[51:17] stopped here
[51:18] because the rest of it pertained to his
[51:19] second coming so let's keep reading in
[51:21] verse 2
[51:22] and the day of vengeance of our god to
[51:24] comfort all that mourn
[51:26] so the day of vengeance of our god amen
[51:29] is the wrath that is going to be poured
[51:30] out
[51:31] is the judgment that's coming upon the
[51:32] earth but listen
[51:34] listen it also says to comfort all that
[51:36] mourn
[51:38] semicolon not the end of the sentence
[51:40] yet
[51:42] let's finish the sentence to appoint
[51:45] unto them that mourn in zion
[51:47] to give unto them beauty for ashes the
[51:49] oil of joy for mourning
[51:51] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[51:53] heaviness that they might be called the
[51:55] trees of
[51:56] righteousness the planting of the lord
[51:59] that he might be
[52:00] glorified all of this is to be fulfilled
[52:03] in the second coming friends
[52:05] and that's what's going on right now
[52:07] judgment to the world amen
[52:09] judgment to the world but comfort to all
[52:10] them that mourn amen you that have
[52:12] mourned the condition of the world you
[52:14] have mourned the rejection of the word
[52:16] you're the mourne now in the second
[52:17] coming there's coming a comfort for you
[52:19] that mourn
[52:20] there's coming to a point unto them that
[52:23] mourn in zion to give unto them beauty
[52:24] for ashes
[52:25] amen you've been rejected the word has
[52:27] been rejected christ has been rejected
[52:29] amen and put on the outside of the
[52:30] church but in the second
[52:32] coming you're getting beauty for ashes
[52:34] the oil of joy for mourning
[52:37] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[52:39] heaviness
[52:41] that they might be called trees
[52:47] trees of righteousness
[52:51] the planting of the lord
[52:56] his garden his vineyard
[53:00] his planting his trees
[53:04] trees of righteousness the planting of
[53:06] the lord
[53:07] that he might be glorified
[53:11] listen the world is falling apart
[53:15] the world is falling apart that's what
[53:18] birth pains were about
[53:21] but the birth pains that were
[53:24] bringing a destruction on the earth the
[53:28] purpose of the birth pains was not to
[53:30] destroy the earth
[53:31] the purpose of the birth pains is to
[53:33] bring a bright new world for a
[53:34] millennium
[53:36] so it just depends on how you look at it
[53:39] whether or not this is a good thing or a
[53:41] bad thing
[53:42] when a woman goes into travail this is
[53:44] what brother brennan begins to preach
[53:45] this is the scripture he's looking for
[53:47] when a woman is in travail amen when a
[53:49] woman is in travail to bring forth a
[53:50] child
[53:51] is that a good thing or a bad thing
[53:55] it's it's painful it's difficult it's
[53:57] near to death for her it's a near-death
[54:00] experience for her
[54:00] amen but she's going through that to
[54:02] produce life she's not going through
[54:04] that just for suffering
[54:05] she's suffering for life she's suffering
[54:08] to bring forth life
[54:10] and the earth is going through birth
[54:12] pains amen to bring forth
[54:14] a bright new world for a millennium amen
[54:16] at the same
[54:17] time that that catastrophe is striking
[54:20] and disasters on every hand
[54:22] and chaos on the earth amen there's oil
[54:25] of joy
[54:27] there's there's beauty for ashes there's
[54:29] a garment of praise for
[54:30] this is not the time to hang our head
[54:32] and kick our feet in the dirt
[54:34] amen he is here amen the light is here
[54:37] the lamb is here
[54:38] the fruit is here amen the carrot's not
[54:40] on the stick but the fruit is in me
[54:43] amen i've tasted of the lord and i know
[54:45] that he's good
[54:46] i've taken the book and eaten the book
[54:48] [Music]
[54:50] this is the second coming for the
[54:51] believers the second coming for the
[54:53] world is destruction
[54:54] the second coming for the believers is
[54:56] joy unspeakable
[54:57] and full of glory
[54:58] [Music]
[55:00] that why what's going to happen in
[55:02] second coming that we might be
[55:04] trees of righteousness
[55:08] the fruit of the righteous is a tree of
[55:09] life these trees are trees of
[55:12] righteousness
[55:15] and brother baby said there's going to
[55:16] be a tree in every yard
[55:19] see all these things are speaking of the
[55:21] same thing
[55:23] not five million trees of life
[55:27] but one tree of life expressed in every
[55:29] member in the bride
[55:32] tree of life in your yard in your yard
[55:34] in your yard in your yard in my yard
[55:37] not a different tree of life not a
[55:40] secondary tree of life
[55:41] not a kind of tree of life or a knockoff
[55:43] tree of life but the tree of life
[55:46] blooming in each believer
[55:50] brother branham says in 1960 to whom
[55:52] would we go
[55:53] if you got a little tree that's got
[55:55] apple trees it'll bear apples if you
[55:57] just put it in the right foundation
[55:59] if you've got a heart hungering for god
[56:01] you want to see the power of god you
[56:02] want to feel the vibrations of his
[56:04] eternal life
[56:04] you want to see if the holy ghost is
[56:06] real or not just plant your tree
[56:08] in his right foundation and you'll find
[56:11] out something goes to work
[56:12] oh he will begin to draw the waters of
[56:14] life and that little tree will begin to
[56:16] bear blossoms and fruit
[56:17] it'll start growing because you're
[56:18] planted right you've got to get started
[56:21] right
[56:22] get get get the revival right
[56:25] so if you want the tree to produce all
[56:27] that it can produce it's got to be in
[56:28] the right foundation or the right soil
[56:30] it's got to be planted on the right
[56:31] foundation which is christ
[56:33] the word the word has been given back to
[56:36] us that the tree can be planted in the
[56:37] right ground
[56:41] 1958 brother behind says if a christian
[56:44] church is divine
[56:46] or the branches that's in christ they'll
[56:48] do the works of christ and bear the life
[56:50] of christ by their fruits you shall know
[56:52] them
[56:53] now then the way that he is today he's
[56:56] here in the form of the holy spirit
[56:58] working through his church performing
[56:59] the same things that he did there
[57:01] that makes him the same yesterday today
[57:03] and forever
[57:05] his life the life that was in christ
[57:07] which was god
[57:09] which was god produced the kind of life
[57:13] that he lived then
[57:14] that same life comes into his churches
[57:16] his church members
[57:18] since they have been purged by his blood
[57:20] and given the holy spirit access to work
[57:22] through them
[57:22] bears the same fruit that he bore so
[57:25] therefore the world can see that christ
[57:27] is the same yesterday
[57:29] today and forever same tree
[57:33] same fruit
[57:36] and in the second adoption message
[57:39] brother brand preaches in 1960
[57:41] said god by his election grace called
[57:44] you
[57:45] god by his election grace sanctified you
[57:47] god by his election grace and his power
[57:49] baptized you and put you into his land
[57:51] of rest
[57:52] they which have entered into this rest
[57:54] have ceased from their going astray they
[57:56] cease from their works like god did from
[57:57] his
[57:58] they have joy unspeakable and full of
[57:59] glory the tree of life is blooming
[58:02] in them where is this tree of life
[58:06] it's blooming in you in your yard
[58:11] amen the tree of life amen brother
[58:13] branham oh
[58:14] i mean i mean don't dismiss anything the
[58:17] prophet of god says
[58:19] he makes a statement like that the tree
[58:20] of life will be blooming in every yard
[58:22] what scripture is that we're talking
[58:23] about
[58:23] oh my goodness just take a prophet for a
[58:25] prophet he's trying to get you to see
[58:27] something he's not saying there's going
[58:29] to be a literal i don't know maybe there
[58:30] is a literal tree of life and everywhere
[58:32] i don't know but what he's trying to
[58:33] show us
[58:34] is the condition that should be present
[58:35] today amen the tree of life should be
[58:37] blooming in our hearts friends
[58:39] it should be bringing forth the same
[58:40] fruit that it produced in the first
[58:42] church the same fruit that it produced
[58:44] in jesus christ
[58:45] it should be producing now amen
[58:48] don't limit that life in any way amen if
[58:51] he
[58:52] if he open blinded eyes he can open
[58:53] blinded eyes today he can do it
[58:55] spiritually and he can do it physically
[58:58] if he raised the dead he can raise the
[58:59] dead today he can raise the spiritually
[59:01] dead and he can raise the
[59:02] physically dead don't limit that fruit
[59:05] in any way and don't put it on a carrot
[59:08] at the end of a stick and say it's for
[59:09] tomorrow or another day or another time
[59:11] it's for now the full life is available
[59:14] now
[59:14] whatever he wants to do he can do amen
[59:17] through his vessels
[59:19] it's not for us to manufacture it's not
[59:20] for us to work up but do not
[59:22] limit the power of god do not limit the
[59:24] life that is here
[59:27] it should be bearing amen this tree
[59:30] that's blooming in our heart it should
[59:31] be bearing
[59:32] all manner of fruit in every season
[59:35] that means when sickness strikes your
[59:37] house amen it should bear fruit of
[59:39] healing
[59:41] amen when need strikes your house it
[59:43] should amen it should bear fruit of
[59:44] provision
[59:46] amen if evil spirits bring torment unto
[59:49] your house
[59:50] it should bring a fruit of deliverance
[59:52] amen this tree that's blooming in our
[59:53] heart it should bring forth fruit in
[59:55] every season and not be barren
[1:00:00] a fruit for every occasion a fruit for
[1:00:04] every need
[1:00:04] amen why because the tree of life is
[1:00:06] blooming in my heart bringing forth
[1:00:08] fruit bringing forward worship bringing
[1:00:09] for obedience amen in every situation
[1:00:12] if sickness comes there's a fruit of
[1:00:14] healing
[1:00:15] if need comes there's a fruit of
[1:00:17] provision
[1:00:19] amen how many of you are experiencing
[1:00:21] that and say that's the truth amen
[1:00:23] when it comes at my door i find there's
[1:00:25] something in me that i didn't know was
[1:00:27] there before and all of a sudden god
[1:00:28] does something
[1:00:29] and there's fruit they meant fruit of
[1:00:31] the word comes on display in the hour of
[1:00:33] need
[1:00:34] why because there's a fruit tree
[1:00:36] blooming in our hearts
[1:00:38] a tree of life is blooming in them they
[1:00:41] have long
[1:00:42] suffering gentleness goodness patience
[1:00:44] faith meekness
[1:00:45] gentleness and so forth the tree of life
[1:00:47] is blooming in them because their hope
[1:00:49] is anchored in christ jesus
[1:00:50] the witness of the holy ghost bearing
[1:00:52] record with signs and wonders
[1:00:54] following the believers let's turn to
[1:00:57] first corinthians together first
[1:00:59] corinthians
[1:01:00] chapter three
[1:01:13] first corinthians chapter 3 verse 6.
[1:01:19] it says i have planted apollos watered
[1:01:21] but god gave the increase
[1:01:24] so that neither is he that planteth
[1:01:25] anything neither he that watereth but
[1:01:27] god that giveth the increase
[1:01:29] now he that planteth and he that
[1:01:30] watereth are one and every man shall
[1:01:32] receive his own reward according to his
[1:01:34] own labor
[1:01:35] for we are laborers together with god i
[1:01:38] mentioned that a few weeks ago but
[1:01:40] they're not laborers for god
[1:01:43] they're working in partnership with god
[1:01:46] ye are god's husbandry
[1:01:51] you're his field you're his garden
[1:01:53] you're his vineyard
[1:01:56] all the labor that was going on was for
[1:01:58] god's husbandry
[1:02:00] you're god's husband you're his building
[1:02:02] you're the thing he's trying
[1:02:04] you're the garden he's bringing back
[1:02:08] you're the tree he's restoring
[1:02:11] you're his project he's the great
[1:02:13] husbandman which means farmer or keeper
[1:02:15] of vines
[1:02:18] amen and and all the ministry that paul
[1:02:20] was talking about
[1:02:21] we're laborers together with god but
[1:02:24] you're the project we're all working on
[1:02:26] you're the project god's working on
[1:02:28] you're the project paul was working
[1:02:29] you're the project apollos is working on
[1:02:31] one's planting one's water
[1:02:33] one's pruning what are we doing what are
[1:02:35] we working for we're working for the
[1:02:36] bride tree
[1:02:38] we're working for the restoration of the
[1:02:40] bride tree
[1:02:43] let's go to john 15.
[1:02:49] god uses this analogy over and over and
[1:02:52] over again
[1:02:53] we're the planting of the lord we're the
[1:02:55] vineyard of the lord we're the
[1:02:57] vine of of christ and we're the branches
[1:03:00] he's divine
[1:03:01] just over and over we see the same thing
[1:03:03] reflecting back
[1:03:05] john 15 1
[1:03:08] i am the true vine and my father is the
[1:03:11] husbandman
[1:03:13] every banter in me that beareth not
[1:03:14] fruity taketh away and every branch that
[1:03:16] beareth fruity purges it
[1:03:18] that it may bring forth more fruit
[1:03:22] see like i said there's a process
[1:03:26] and in this process apollos paul
[1:03:30] pastor evangelist friend
[1:03:33] another brother they're laborers
[1:03:36] together with god
[1:03:38] in god's husbandry in his field
[1:03:42] but part of what god does is right here
[1:03:47] every breast that beareth fruit he
[1:03:50] purgeth it
[1:03:55] but it was bearing fruit
[1:03:59] why did he purge it why did he cut it
[1:04:02] why it was bearing fruit
[1:04:06] because when he began to see fruit he
[1:04:09] recognized that's a true vine
[1:04:12] when it begins to give fruit of the word
[1:04:14] amen how many of you can testify of this
[1:04:16] with me
[1:04:17] amen when you gave your heart to the
[1:04:18] lord and god miraculously transformed
[1:04:21] your life
[1:04:21] all of a sudden there was fruit fruit
[1:04:23] fruit answered prayers healings all
[1:04:24] kinds of manifestations
[1:04:28] and then all the sudden purging
[1:04:31] and nothing you pray for happened before
[1:04:35] every prayer you prayed was answered
[1:04:36] then all of a sudden you go through a
[1:04:38] time
[1:04:38] what's he doing he eat that that's a
[1:04:40] vine
[1:04:41] that's an original fine from the
[1:04:43] original rootstock amen it's bringing
[1:04:45] forth fruit
[1:04:45] amen that's where amen we all got to get
[1:04:48] together and work with god amen and work
[1:04:50] in this vineyard
[1:04:50] this is one from the original stock
[1:04:52] friends this is one that's
[1:04:54] tied back to the original amen this is
[1:04:56] where the pruning comes
[1:04:59] he didn't prune it ain't meant to stop
[1:05:01] it from bearing fruit
[1:05:04] he said he that beareth fruit he purges
[1:05:06] it that it might bring forth
[1:05:08] more fruit
[1:05:12] because this this bride tree is going to
[1:05:15] bear
[1:05:15] every month not just
[1:05:18] one time not a flash in a pan but when
[1:05:21] god's done when the great husbandman is
[1:05:23] done with his work
[1:05:24] he's going to prune off every little
[1:05:26] sucker
[1:05:27] everything that that's not producing
[1:05:29] life everything that's extra everything
[1:05:31] that's unnecessary
[1:05:32] he's going to he's going to strip it
[1:05:33] away he's going to prune it away
[1:05:35] amen so that it can bring forth more
[1:05:37] fruit there's going to be fruit
[1:05:39] every month amen there's going to be all
[1:05:41] manner of fruit in its season
[1:05:44] she says jesus goes on to say now you
[1:05:46] are clean through the word which i have
[1:05:48] spoken unto you
[1:05:49] abide in me and i in you as the branch
[1:05:51] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:05:53] abide in the vine
[1:05:54] no more can ye except you abide in me i
[1:05:57] am the vine you are the branches he that
[1:05:59] abideth in me and i
[1:06:00] in him the same bringeth forth much
[1:06:03] fruit
[1:06:04] for without me he can do nothing if a
[1:06:06] man abide not in me
[1:06:08] he is cast forth as a branch and is
[1:06:10] withered and men gather them and cast
[1:06:11] them into the fire
[1:06:13] and they are burned if you abide in me
[1:06:15] and my words abide in you you shall ask
[1:06:17] what you will
[1:06:18] and it shall be done unto you hearing is
[1:06:20] my father glorified that you bear
[1:06:22] much fruit so that ye be my disciples
[1:06:26] how is the glory glorified when you bear
[1:06:29] much fruit it glorifies god
[1:06:31] not you it glorifies the husband men who
[1:06:34] kept this vine
[1:06:36] that's why in isaiah 61 3 you are the
[1:06:39] your trees of righteousness the planting
[1:06:41] of the lord that he might be
[1:06:43] glorified this tree bringing forth fruit
[1:06:46] in its season is to glorify god
[1:06:48] because it was his plan from the
[1:06:51] beginning
[1:06:53] see like i said god uses this analogy
[1:06:55] over and over and over again
[1:06:56] he even uses his analogy in the old
[1:06:58] testament amen speaking of the nation of
[1:07:00] israel
[1:07:01] he said consider my vineyard what more
[1:07:03] could i have done
[1:07:04] i mean i i built a hedge of protection
[1:07:07] around them
[1:07:07] amen i digged and i dung the soil i for
[1:07:10] i did everything but yet it still
[1:07:12] wouldn't give me fruit
[1:07:16] see god's very clear
[1:07:20] in his description in the bible he
[1:07:22] doesn't want
[1:07:23] a vine that says i'm a vine
[1:07:29] he wants the manifestation of the life
[1:07:31] from the root to come out of this branch
[1:07:35] he doesn't want to say i'm a christian
[1:07:36] i'm a christian i believe the message
[1:07:38] that's not what he's looking for he's
[1:07:40] looking for something that'll bring the
[1:07:42] life of the message the fruit of the
[1:07:44] message amen what
[1:07:45] what god was talking about all through
[1:07:47] his bible he doesn't want
[1:07:48] i mean he doesn't want a nice stone
[1:07:50] hedge all the way around and a bunch of
[1:07:52] unbearing vines amen he wants something
[1:07:54] that's bringing forth fruit
[1:07:56] he said i that this was a good garden
[1:07:59] israel was a good garden amen it had
[1:08:01] stone wall all the way around it it had
[1:08:03] he had dung the soil he had digged the
[1:08:05] soil he had pruned the vine
[1:08:07] and when he goes back to it there's no
[1:08:08] fruits that's why jesus curses the fig
[1:08:11] tree because there's no fruit
[1:08:16] god doesn't want us to know about these
[1:08:19] things he wants us to live
[1:08:20] them god doesn't want us to say someday
[1:08:24] oh this this bride tree that someday
[1:08:27] she's going to produce fruit
[1:08:30] what more does he have to do friends
[1:08:33] he's put the wall up he's trimming the
[1:08:35] vines
[1:08:36] he's done the soil he's digged it amen
[1:08:39] what's he looking for
[1:08:40] for fruits yield back to him
[1:08:44] fruit brother
[1:08:48] says in christ is the mystery of god
[1:08:49] revealed he says now
[1:08:51] there's only one thing can happen there
[1:08:53] has to be a message at the end time
[1:08:55] when there's nothing else can follow it
[1:08:57] and now the ecumenical world has set up
[1:08:59] of such a regime there could be no
[1:09:01] denomination and no nothing else follow
[1:09:03] it you're either in it or you're not in
[1:09:05] it the fruit is in the top of the tree
[1:09:06] and the light is shining on that
[1:09:08] predestinated fruit
[1:09:09] and she is ripening into christ-like
[1:09:12] fruit bringing forth the same
[1:09:14] mellowness and sweetness and the same
[1:09:16] spirit that he had in him
[1:09:19] i hope you see it see
[1:09:22] when brother ram goes into crisis mr god
[1:09:24] revealed for me
[1:09:26] this clarifies some things for me
[1:09:29] because it's not just being able to
[1:09:31] replicate
[1:09:32] certain kind of works but it's to have
[1:09:35] the same
[1:09:36] spirit
[1:09:39] you can replicate some of the works
[1:09:42] like you can replicate there can be a
[1:09:44] replication of healing
[1:09:45] motherboard said you know the witch
[1:09:47] doctors can accomplish some of that
[1:09:49] a replication of tongues and
[1:09:51] interpretations and a witch doctor
[1:09:53] you can have i mean all kinds of
[1:09:54] denominations can have different
[1:09:56] replications of certain works
[1:09:57] amen and if we if we have to take if we
[1:10:00] have to take
[1:10:00] every work as a sign that that's where
[1:10:03] christ is
[1:10:03] then every time there's a healing you
[1:10:05] have to say christ is in that church
[1:10:09] which there's always healing that's one
[1:10:11] of the fruits
[1:10:13] it should always be there divine healing
[1:10:15] should always be part of us amen
[1:10:17] tongue should always be part of us every
[1:10:19] gift that was ever given was never taken
[1:10:21] away
[1:10:23] but what he's showing here is it's not
[1:10:25] just a certain gift that's replicated or
[1:10:27] a certain demonstration
[1:10:28] but it's the very nature in life
[1:10:32] that was in that original tree amen is
[1:10:34] what's shining forth in this bride tree
[1:10:37] it can't have a different nature it
[1:10:39] can't have a different
[1:10:41] sweetness and melons than christ himself
[1:10:45] i don't care i don't i shouldn't say i
[1:10:47] don't care
[1:10:49] but you can get look alike fruit
[1:10:53] and not have the same life in the root
[1:10:57] but we want all the fruit that's
[1:10:59] supposed to be on this tree
[1:11:00] that's coming from the original life
[1:11:04] the original nature it's got to be the
[1:11:06] same melons
[1:11:08] and sweetness and the same spirit that
[1:11:10] he had in him
[1:11:14] brother says in jehovah jireh from 1964
[1:11:16] he said look old brother
[1:11:17] when the holy spirit come into that vine
[1:11:19] and produce from its vine to the first
[1:11:21] branch and they wrote a book of acts
[1:11:23] behind it
[1:11:24] if that tree ever puts forth another
[1:11:25] original limb she'll grow
[1:11:27] the same thing it'll be jesus christ
[1:11:33] what did he say did you catch that he
[1:11:36] said if this
[1:11:37] this original book of acts he said when
[1:11:39] the vine put that first
[1:11:41] vine put forth the branch they wrote a
[1:11:42] book of acts of founder if they ever do
[1:11:44] the same thing it'll be the same thing
[1:11:46] it'll be jesus christ
[1:11:50] not doing some of the things he did
[1:11:52] it'll be him
[1:11:53] with his full nature in his full life
[1:11:57] now we've got methodist presbyterian
[1:11:59] baptist lutheran everything else grafted
[1:12:01] into it
[1:12:01] bearing denominational fruit but if it
[1:12:03] ever puts forth another branch
[1:12:05] she'll be a genuine christ-filled
[1:12:07] christ-centered word
[1:12:08] of god it didn't say she'd believe the
[1:12:11] word of god and said she would be the
[1:12:13] word of god
[1:12:16] she'll be a genuine christ-filled
[1:12:18] christ-centered
[1:12:20] word of god the word of god
[1:12:24] made alive let's took the romans i want
[1:12:27] to read this
[1:12:28] as our last scripture romans chapter 7.
[1:12:36] romans chapter 7 verse 1.
[1:12:49] yeah romans 7 1. know you not brethren
[1:12:52] for i speak to them that know the law
[1:12:54] how that the law hath dominion over a
[1:12:56] man as long as he
[1:12:56] liveth for the woman which hath the
[1:12:58] husband is bound by the law to her
[1:13:00] husband so long as he liveth
[1:13:01] but if the husband be dead she is loosed
[1:13:03] from the law of her husband
[1:13:05] so then if while her husband liveth
[1:13:06] should be married to another man
[1:13:08] she shall be called an adulteress but if
[1:13:10] her husband is dead
[1:13:13] she is free from the law so that she is
[1:13:15] no adulteress though she be married to
[1:13:16] another
[1:13:18] wherefore my brethren you also are
[1:13:20] become dead to the law by the body of
[1:13:22] christ
[1:13:23] that you should be married to another
[1:13:24] even to him who is raised from the dead
[1:13:27] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[1:13:30] god
[1:13:32] how are we going to bring forth fruits
[1:13:35] we have to get married
[1:13:39] we have to be divorced from the old life
[1:13:42] from the old man
[1:13:43] from the old nature it has to die amen
[1:13:46] but then we have to be married to christ
[1:13:49] so that we can bring forth fruit unto
[1:13:52] god
[1:13:53] this bride tree has to bring forth fruit
[1:13:57] brother beth says in the restoration of
[1:13:58] the bride tree but what he was
[1:14:01] god's perfect prophet tree the example
[1:14:03] tree the bridegroom tree amen glory
[1:14:05] going to say something directly he is
[1:14:08] the bridegroom tree do you believe it
[1:14:10] from the garden of eden amen then the
[1:14:12] bridegroom tree without the female
[1:14:15] don't bear fruit so he's got to have
[1:14:19] a bride tree she has got to be born of
[1:14:22] the same material the word made flesh in
[1:14:24] the tree
[1:14:25] hope you get it it's the same life in
[1:14:27] this female tree the bridegroom
[1:14:29] as it is in the bride the works that i
[1:14:31] do shall you
[1:14:33] also why because it's the same life
[1:14:37] so if the bridegroom tree
[1:14:41] can't produce fruit without the bride
[1:14:42] tree can the bride tree produce fruit
[1:14:45] without the bridegroom tree
[1:14:51] see what's the key
[1:14:54] to producing fruit one you have to be
[1:14:58] the right seed
[1:15:02] you have to be planted in the right
[1:15:03] foundation which is the word
[1:15:05] the right seed in the right foundation
[1:15:09] then it's got to be watered from the
[1:15:11] word it's got to receive the light of
[1:15:12] the sun
[1:15:13] amen all of these things that was typed
[1:15:15] out through the message and in the bible
[1:15:18] and it grows up and it's got to be
[1:15:19] purged and pruned by the husbandmen
[1:15:24] but still it's got to come in contact
[1:15:27] with the mail
[1:15:29] to bring forth life the bridegroom tree
[1:15:33] needs the bride tree the bride true
[1:15:36] needs the bridegroom tree
[1:15:38] you say i'm i'm bride i'm bright i'm
[1:15:40] bride that's wonderful
[1:15:42] amen but you've got to be one with the
[1:15:44] bridegroom so that the life of the
[1:15:45] bridegroom amen can come through the
[1:15:47] bride tree
[1:15:50] because the tree of life has to be
[1:15:52] blooming
[1:15:53] in every yard bringing forth all manner
[1:15:56] of fruit this is the wedding the wedding
[1:16:00] has produced pollination
[1:16:02] pollination produces fruit
[1:16:06] this is the season friends
[1:16:09] i want to finish with this last quote
[1:16:12] brother man says in investments 1963 he
[1:16:15] says
[1:16:16] i was remarking about in my soul a few
[1:16:18] moments ago
[1:16:19] mind about bearing the fruit of the
[1:16:21] spirit as one of the brothers
[1:16:23] give that quotation bearing fruit you
[1:16:25] know
[1:16:26] we can't manufacture fruit
[1:16:30] we have to bear fruit
[1:16:33] sheep doesn't manufacture wool but
[1:16:36] because he would
[1:16:37] but because he has wool and bears wool
[1:16:40] he is a sheep these are simple ideas
[1:16:43] simple concepts
[1:16:45] but they're as true as true can be all
[1:16:47] the way through
[1:16:49] he bears well he is a sheep that's the
[1:16:51] reason he bears wool
[1:16:52] that's the only way we can ever be a
[1:16:55] christian is not because that we have
[1:16:56] the name
[1:16:57] or try to work up something to
[1:16:58] manufacture it being a sheep you just
[1:17:01] bare wool being a christian you just
[1:17:03] bear the fruits of it
[1:17:07] see we can't work this up
[1:17:11] we can't pump it up we can't manufacture
[1:17:14] it we can't make it happen
[1:17:17] but on the flip side i i'd like to i'd
[1:17:20] like to bring balance to that
[1:17:22] we can hinder it
[1:17:27] so you you can't make yourself seed when
[1:17:30] you're not seed
[1:17:32] but even if you are the right seed you
[1:17:33] can hinder this process
[1:17:36] you can hinder this process by staying
[1:17:38] away from the husbandmen
[1:17:40] you can hinder this process by not
[1:17:42] drinking in the water
[1:17:44] you can hinder this process by not
[1:17:45] standing still and being pruned
[1:17:49] see we can hinder this process but we
[1:17:51] can never
[1:17:52] manufacture fruit so there's this
[1:17:56] there's this calvinistic armenian thing
[1:17:58] again
[1:17:59] we're back him into the book of
[1:18:01] ephesians again back to the
[1:18:03] the fact that if you're not of the
[1:18:05] original stock of the original tree of
[1:18:06] life you cannot produce the 12 manner of
[1:18:08] fruits
[1:18:10] but even if you are of that original
[1:18:12] stock and then that original and you've
[1:18:14] got the capability of producing fruit in
[1:18:16] every season
[1:18:17] under every occasion for every need it's
[1:18:20] all there the potential's in the seed i
[1:18:22] mean you've got it all but you've got to
[1:18:23] be able to stand the purging you got to
[1:18:25] be drinking in the water you got to be
[1:18:27] basking in the light amen we got to be
[1:18:29] surrendering and submissing in pure
[1:18:31] worship to god
[1:18:32] and if we can just surrender to him and
[1:18:34] let him cut where we need caught if we
[1:18:36] just let him bring the water and the
[1:18:38] rain and drink it in when he gives it to
[1:18:40] us
[1:18:40] if we'll just lay in the presence of the
[1:18:42] sun we will produce
[1:18:43] 12 manner of fruit fruit for every
[1:18:46] occasion fruit for every season
[1:18:48] fruit to meet every need that comes our
[1:18:52] way
[1:18:54] and if we look at our lives and we
[1:18:55] reflect and we say
[1:18:58] sometimes i'm satisfied with what i see
[1:19:01] i see god working in my life
[1:19:03] but over here i'm not so satisfied
[1:19:07] ten months of the year fruit
[1:19:10] two months the tree's not bearing
[1:19:14] doing good at work doing good at church
[1:19:16] not so good at home
[1:19:19] right good at home good at work
[1:19:22] not so good with my brothers and sisters
[1:19:25] church
[1:19:27] this is reality this is the reality
[1:19:31] i'm not saying that's not a tree of life
[1:19:32] i'm not saying the tree of life is not
[1:19:34] blooming in your yard but that tree of
[1:19:35] life isn't intended
[1:19:37] to constantly bring forth fruit for
[1:19:39] every occasion in every season
[1:19:43] sometimes we just need to look and say
[1:19:45] god
[1:19:47] i realize you need to purge me
[1:19:50] i realize that i'm dry and i need a
[1:19:52] little bit of rain
[1:19:56] god help me not to run from the light
[1:19:58] but help me to lean into the light
[1:20:02] help me not to stay away from fellowship
[1:20:04] help me not to remove myself
[1:20:06] from the purging hand of the husbandman
[1:20:09] help me just to surrender lord
[1:20:11] amen i'm not happy
[1:20:14] with partial because this isn't the age
[1:20:17] of partial
[1:20:19] i'm not just happy that i believe the
[1:20:21] message and got a sanctified life and
[1:20:23] i've got a revelation of the seals
[1:20:25] and i've got a nice family but i want to
[1:20:29] bear
[1:20:29] all manner of fruit in every season
[1:20:33] i want to have no barrenness in my life
[1:20:36] in any place i want every branch
[1:20:40] every vine in this tree to bloom and
[1:20:42] bring forth fruit
[1:20:44] and i can't do it i can't do it on my
[1:20:46] own
[1:20:48] but god's promised that he'll send the
[1:20:50] reign
[1:20:52] and that there's a team of workers
[1:20:55] laboring with god in god's husbandry
[1:21:00] and just yield to that hand
[1:21:04] god knows what's in us
[1:21:07] and he knows to get it out how to get it
[1:21:09] out
[1:21:11] if you see a tree if you go by and you
[1:21:14] look at apple trees right now
[1:21:16] apple trees are bearing like crazy
[1:21:18] they're starting to harvest
[1:21:20] they'll be harvesting now i don't know
[1:21:22] how long but
[1:21:24] the leafy green bunch of apples hanging
[1:21:27] all
[1:21:28] over it but you know the husband
[1:21:31] of that field after he gathers up those
[1:21:33] apples if he wants to get the same thing
[1:21:35] next year
[1:21:36] what is he going to have to do to that
[1:21:38] tree here in a month or two he's going
[1:21:40] to have to cut it down
[1:21:43] and it's going to look like he tried to
[1:21:45] kill the tree
[1:21:48] and you're going to say what did you do
[1:21:49] to your tree
[1:21:52] he said i'm ensuring that it'll bring
[1:21:54] forth in its season again
[1:21:58] see there's times that god because
[1:22:01] because he intends for the tree of life
[1:22:03] to be blooming
[1:22:05] there's times he's got to cut time to
[1:22:08] water
[1:22:09] time to fertilize time for everything
[1:22:12] but he's going to make sure that we bear
[1:22:14] 12 manner of fruit
[1:22:17] and i say be it unto me god i'm your
[1:22:20] tree i believe with all my heart i'm
[1:22:22] part of that tree
[1:22:24] i believe it i believe that i'm part of
[1:22:26] that city
[1:22:27] that that if he talks about a dwelling
[1:22:29] place there
[1:22:31] it's me he's talking about me if he says
[1:22:34] there'll be
[1:22:35] if the if he says the tree of life will
[1:22:37] be blooming in every yard
[1:22:38] that's describing me that's my yard i
[1:22:41] believe it
[1:22:43] but i also know i need the great
[1:22:44] husbandmen to keep doing the work
[1:22:47] so that i can bring forth fruit in every
[1:22:49] season
[1:22:51] i want to bear all manner of fruit i
[1:22:54] want to be whatever jesus christ was on
[1:22:56] earth i want him to have that potential
[1:22:57] in me
[1:22:58] and whenever he calls for it i want it
[1:22:59] to come out
[1:23:02] if he uses opposition to bring it out so
[1:23:05] be it
[1:23:06] if he uses difficulty and hardship to
[1:23:08] bring out that fruit so be it
[1:23:10] my goal is to bear fruit in every season
[1:23:12] not to dictate which season
[1:23:15] i've got to bear fruit in july i got to
[1:23:18] bear fruit in june
[1:23:21] because he's going to have all manner of
[1:23:22] fruit
[1:23:24] there's going to be a tree of life
[1:23:27] blooming
[1:23:28] in every yard let's all stand
[1:23:33] do you believe you're part of that tree
[1:23:34] of life
[1:23:37] let's bow our heads and close our eyes
[1:23:41] just in your own heart how many of you
[1:23:44] like to say lord
[1:23:46] i think i need some pruning
[1:23:50] but i welcome it lord or we can maybe
[1:23:53] say lord i
[1:23:54] see that what's going on in my life is
[1:23:56] you've been pruning me
[1:23:58] you're not mad at me it's not just a bad
[1:24:00] set of circumstances it's not just
[1:24:03] a lot in life i have but it's actually
[1:24:05] lord your hand pruning me
[1:24:08] you may not have recognized it brother
[1:24:10] or sister you may not have recognized it
[1:24:11] till tonight
[1:24:13] but it wasn't just a bad set of
[1:24:14] circumstances
[1:24:16] it wasn't just something you're going
[1:24:17] through but there's a hand that's
[1:24:20] holding the pruning shears
[1:24:22] and he knows how much to cut off and how
[1:24:24] much to leave on
[1:24:26] and he knows how to get the fruit out of
[1:24:28] this tree
[1:24:30] he knows when we need rain he knows when
[1:24:32] we need purge he knows what
[1:24:34] how much sun we need
[1:24:37] and we just if we could just reflect and
[1:24:39] say lord
[1:24:40] i recognize it's been you all along it's
[1:24:44] not been me with a
[1:24:45] bad life bad set of circumstances
[1:24:49] and if i if i had only made other
[1:24:51] decisions things would have worked out
[1:24:53] different
[1:24:53] no lord you're trying to mold me into
[1:24:56] your image
[1:24:59] how many of you would like to just say
[1:25:01] god i recognize
[1:25:03] that this has all been you
[1:25:06] because you want a planting
[1:25:09] a planting tree of righteousness the
