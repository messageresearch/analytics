[0:00] when they brought the woman to him that
[0:02] was caught in the very Act of adultery
[0:04] they had him nailed this time because
[0:06] she's caught in the very Act of
[0:08] adultery but somehow Jesus could discern
[0:12] and know that that whole thing was a
[0:14] setup yeah right and he unraveled the
[0:18] whole setup because listen this wasn't a
[0:22] debate between Jesus and the Pharisees
[0:24] on the word yeah he wasn't debating
[0:30] he went beyond the squabble he went
[0:33] beyond the tis fortat and he went to the
[0:36] very nature and he started to show that
[0:39] you who want to condemn have the wrong
[0:42] nature yeah amen you're claiming to be
[0:46] standing by the word but you're not
[0:48] actually standing by the word because
[0:50] you don't have the nature of the word
[0:53] and you're not applying the nature of
[0:55] the word in this
[0:58] circumstance listen this was a total
[1:01] setup they found a woman caught in the
[1:02] very Act of adultery if she's caught in
[1:04] the very Act of adultery then they had a
[1:06] they knew exactly who the man was
[1:09] y right but the Bible tells us that
[1:13] they're both supposed to be condemned
[1:15] and they're both supposed to be stoned
[1:17] so right away amen they they're keeping
[1:20] the word but not keeping the word they
[1:23] don't have pure motives amen they're not
[1:25] pure they're not gentle they don't have
[1:27] the wisdom that come from above but this
[1:29] is devilish sensual wisdom trying to do
[1:32] trying to get rid of an enemy yeah right
[1:37] and to do so they'll take the word and
[1:38] manipulate it by their own wisdom Amen
[1:41] to serve their own purpose and it was
[1:43] never God's original intent to begin
[1:45] with so Jesus comes and flies higher
[1:47] than all of that and starts to expose
[1:48] the hypocrisy that's in their heart and
[1:50] he doesn't tell them you're wrong or you
[1:52] can't soner or you're off the word he
[1:54] just says which one of you is without
[1:56] sin Let Him cast the first stone and all
[1:58] of a sudden starting from the oldest to
[2:00] the youngest they dropped their stones
[2:01] and they walked away I said oh God
[2:04] that's the wisdom I want in my life
[2:06] that's the wisdom from above amen that
[2:08] there's no listen Jesus in no way
[2:11] violated the word of God he kept it all
[2:13] in every point but he had a greater
[2:16] understanding than what the Pharisees
[2:18] were trying to bring him into they were
[2:19] trying to lower him into a tis fortat
[2:22] devilish wisdom on the Bible yeah amen
[2:27] right I want that with wisdom in me the
[2:31] one that
[2:33] knows brother Brenham says this I may
[2:36] not know my Bible very well but I know
[2:38] the author very well that's what I'm
[2:40] after friends I think that's what this
[2:42] wisdom is it's the life of the author
[2:43] it's the mind of the author amen it's
[2:45] the wisdom of the
[2:48] author that's what I want
