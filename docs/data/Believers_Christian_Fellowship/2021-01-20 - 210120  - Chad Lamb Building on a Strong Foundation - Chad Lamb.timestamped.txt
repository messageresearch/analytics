[4:33] praise god amen how many are happy to be
[4:36] here tonight
[4:38] man it's good to see you let's take our
[4:40] bibles while we're standing go to
[4:41] hebrews chapter 11.
[4:45] i'm going to continue on with some
[4:47] things that we've been talking about but
[4:49] i'm going to back up and
[4:50] kind of hit a foundational element here
[4:52] the lord has just been
[4:53] leading me this direction all day for a
[4:56] couple days now
[4:58] so we're going to look at building on a
[5:00] strong foundation
[5:02] and we're going to talk about this and
[5:04] we're going to begin here in hebrews
[5:05] chapter 11
[5:06] the foundation of faith
[5:16] hebrews chapter 11
[5:19] and i want to go
[5:23] to verse 1.
[5:26] let me get caught up here hebrews
[5:28] chapter 11
[5:30] and verse 1. now faith is the substance
[5:33] of things hoped for
[5:35] the evidence of things not seen for by
[5:38] it the elders obtained a good report
[5:40] through faith we understand that the
[5:41] worlds were framed by the word of god
[5:44] so that things which are seen were not
[5:46] made of things which do appear
[5:48] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[5:50] excellent sacrifice than cain
[5:52] by which he obtained witness that he was
[5:54] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[5:57] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[6:00] by faith enoch was translated that he
[6:02] should see death
[6:03] and was not found because god had
[6:05] translated him for before his
[6:06] translation
[6:08] he had this testimony that he pleased
[6:10] god
[6:11] but without faith it is impossible to
[6:13] please him
[6:14] for he that cometh to god must believe
[6:16] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[6:18] them that diligently
[6:20] seek him let's bow our heads
[6:23] lord jesus we ask that you would bless
[6:25] us now lord
[6:26] that you would minister unto us god that
[6:29] you would break the bread of life to us
[6:31] your waiting children
[6:33] lord as we've come tonight let it not be
[6:35] a routine or a tradition
[6:37] but lord let our hearts come full lord
[6:39] wanting to hear from you
[6:41] and may you meet us in a special way
[6:42] tonight and speak to individuals
[6:44] who have needs lord and only you know
[6:46] the needs and only you know how to take
[6:48] the word
[6:49] and place it right on top of that need
[6:51] lord and we ask that you would do it
[6:53] lord for you're the great physician
[6:55] we pray god that you would anoint these
[6:56] lips to speak your word and
[6:58] anoint our ears to hear in our hearts to
[7:00] perceive all that you have
[7:02] for us in this day in jesus christ's
[7:04] name we pray
[7:05] amen you can all be seated
[7:09] amen and i hope i don't disappoint you i
[7:12] don't have a great message on
[7:15] prepared on political things and the
[7:17] inauguration
[7:18] and because this is kind of old news now
[7:21] you know
[7:22] we've known what's been happening and we
[7:24] know that there was inauguration
[7:25] an inauguration of a new president and
[7:28] vice president and for the first time we
[7:29] have a female vice president united
[7:31] states
[7:32] and um you know we've had three
[7:35] wednesdays in a row that's been
[7:36] interesting you know we've had
[7:38] two wednesdays back we had a great uh
[7:41] riot in the capital and then
[7:43] the win the the last wednesday we had an
[7:45] impeachment of the
[7:46] president for the second time and then
[7:48] we've had an inauguration of a new
[7:50] president and the first female vice
[7:51] president united states
[7:53] and i say we've had three big wednesdays
[7:56] and but you know you know i spoke about
[7:58] this before when
[7:59] it looked like the election was going to
[8:01] go to um
[8:03] uh joe biden and kamala harris and i
[8:05] laid down the quotes and i spoke about
[8:07] that before and i feel the same way that
[8:09] i did then
[8:10] that brother branham told us the
[8:11] fulfillment of that prophecy was the
[8:13] catholic church
[8:14] it was the catholic church coming into
[8:16] america he said she's already on the
[8:18] throne
[8:19] but i do believe that god has natural
[8:22] types of spiritual fulfillment and god
[8:24] is very well
[8:25] allowing and it has been for the last
[8:27] decade or so that women have been rising
[8:29] to power in america
[8:31] as a symbol of where that catholic
[8:33] church is
[8:35] so now is not the time to be a believer
[8:37] in the prophecy it was decades ago we
[8:39] should have been a believer in the
[8:40] prophecy
[8:42] is that right now is not the time to be
[8:43] a great message believer we've known
[8:45] this
[8:45] amen and now now's not the time to get
[8:48] on board
[8:49] it was the catholic church brother
[8:51] brethren said it was the catholic church
[8:53] right the deception kamala harris is not
[8:55] the deception
[8:57] are you deceived by that nobody's going
[9:00] to be deceived that not even a nominal
[9:02] christian is going to be deceived by
[9:03] that
[9:04] but it's that system that's behind it
[9:07] it's that system that's working it's
[9:08] that
[9:09] catholic system that's taking over
[9:10] control of the world and if anything god
[9:13] is showing it on the outside
[9:15] what's going on behind closed doors
[9:18] so because of that because we've known
[9:20] where we stand on this and because of
[9:22] what brother branham told us i don't
[9:23] have a message on politics
[9:26] i just have a simple message on faith
[9:30] amen because we are the seed of abraham
[9:31] children of faith faith seed of abraham
[9:34] and that gets us everywhere we go if you
[9:36] know i mean there's going to be
[9:38] i just warned you there's going to be
[9:39] buzz buzz buzz buzz all over the place
[9:42] about this and you your phone may
[9:44] already be lit up and you may be getting
[9:45] pictures in this and that and that
[9:47] i'd say hey this is old news we know
[9:50] what this is amen
[9:52] god is god's prophecy is still marching
[9:54] on amen the plan of god is still moving
[9:56] forward
[9:57] and i still want to want to know what he
[9:59] wants me to do today
[10:01] and i still want to know how he wants me
[10:02] to act in this situation how he wants
[10:04] me to live in this environment in this
[10:07] world and how
[10:08] that christ wants to be known in the
[10:10] formation of his bride
[10:12] and so now is the time for us to rise
[10:14] and shine like always amen
[10:16] and we we go to this scripture entitled
[10:19] this building on a strong foundation the
[10:20] lord's been drawing my attention back
[10:22] and i just assume that there's a need
[10:24] somewhere in the assembly because
[10:26] he won't let me get off into other
[10:28] things and
[10:29] i want to be preaching you know i told
[10:31] somebody i want to preach on the
[10:32] capstone but i'm preaching on the
[10:34] foundation amen
[10:36] and and this is for us we have need of
[10:38] these things
[10:39] but if we look here at verse 6
[10:42] hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 but without
[10:45] faith
[10:46] it is impossible to please him for he
[10:48] that cometh to god must believe that he
[10:50] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[10:51] that diligently seek him
[10:53] so without faith it is impossible to
[10:55] please him
[10:56] and that statement i want to hone in on
[10:58] right now without faith it's impossible
[11:00] to please him
[11:02] because i want to put the devil to
[11:03] flight right now
[11:05] because how many times have we exhausted
[11:07] ourselves trying to please him
[11:10] by our own works and our own efforts and
[11:12] our own thoughts and our own
[11:14] this and our own that trying to find
[11:16] favor with god through a works program
[11:18] that we worked up ourselves or
[11:20] a good behavior program or some way to
[11:22] get in good with god to please god
[11:24] amen an old denominational way of
[11:27] thinking an old
[11:28] leftover carryover idea from the
[11:30] denominations that i must be a good boy
[11:33] and i must do right to please the lord
[11:35] but the scripture is clear that the only
[11:37] way to please him is by faith and my
[11:40] faith is what pleases him amen
[11:44] so brother brendon even told us that
[11:46] that you know
[11:48] works is faith expressed the works does
[11:50] not bring faith works is an expression
[11:52] of faith
[11:53] and brother brahm says yeah brother of
[11:55] them said that god sees our faith
[11:57] man sees our works man can see our faith
[11:59] by by the outcropping or the working of
[12:01] our faith
[12:02] but god god sees the works but god sees
[12:05] the faith behind the words
[12:07] and it's not the works that please him
[12:08] although we have a desire to do whatever
[12:10] he wants and obey his commandments and
[12:12] walk in his word
[12:13] amen but it's the faith that pleases god
[12:15] and so this is the foundation that we
[12:17] want to focus on
[12:18] is faith if we turn to ephesians chapter
[12:21] 2
[12:22] i keep your bibles handy because i want
[12:24] to go to a lot of scriptures
[12:25] and maybe we'll just slow down and do
[12:27] this as a bible study
[12:30] maybe ephesians chapter 2 verse 8
[12:34] very very very familiar scripture but i
[12:36] want to lay it in right here for by
[12:38] grace are you saved through faith
[12:40] and that not of yourselves it is the
[12:42] gift of god
[12:44] not of works lest any man should boast
[12:46] now focus on eight now
[12:48] we are for by grace are you saved
[12:50] through faith and that not of yourselves
[12:52] it is the gift of god
[12:54] amen so without faith it's impossible to
[12:57] please god
[12:58] and i'm not say i'm saved by grace
[13:01] through faith and that not of myself
[13:03] it's a gift of god
[13:04] so i have a gift of god to believe in
[13:06] god and the only way to please god is to
[13:08] believe in god
[13:09] but i have a gift of faith that didn't
[13:11] come from myself it came from god
[13:13] so i have the mechanism already inside
[13:15] to please him
[13:18] not the external works or the or the the
[13:20] conjectures of my mind or the labors of
[13:23] my arm amen
[13:24] but there's something that he placed
[13:25] inside of me a gift that came from him
[13:27] and that gift expressed is the only way
[13:30] that i can please him
[13:32] so you see god god has not and like i
[13:35] said i want to establish a foundation
[13:37] amen it might be for the youth it might
[13:39] be for an old timer it might be for a
[13:40] newcomer
[13:41] but i want to establish this on this
[13:43] unmovable foundation
[13:45] because god is not basing his salvation
[13:48] on the fickleness of mankind
[13:50] or your ability to do something right or
[13:53] think right or
[13:54] or you're the hope that god will extend
[13:56] himself
[13:57] amen brother bam talks about this all
[13:59] the time and it's not god
[14:01] hoping that you know if i come down and
[14:03] save the world and make a sacrifice
[14:05] there might be somebody that would
[14:06] believe it amen but he already knew who
[14:09] would believe it before
[14:10] amen this plan was finished in his mind
[14:12] i mean we were already there
[14:15] so god has not based it on your
[14:18] fickleness but so many times
[14:20] we get discouraged and we get down amen
[14:22] and we
[14:23] we start to in our own minds question
[14:26] our sonship
[14:27] and we're basing it upon the flesh man
[14:32] and by basing it upon the flesh man amen
[14:35] we already know who our greatest enemy
[14:36] is it's the guy you look at in the
[14:38] mirror every morning
[14:39] that's your enemy that's the one that
[14:41] that is born in corruption and coming
[14:42] into the world the wrong
[14:44] way it's born and sin come into the
[14:45] world speaking lies and must have its
[14:47] atoms changed
[14:48] must be glorified and so
[14:52] but we base too much of our faith
[14:55] on that what that guy is doing
[14:58] i understand what i'm saying and then we
[15:01] begin to waver and we begin to meander
[15:03] and we begin to question our sonship and
[15:06] whether or not we're saved or whether or
[15:08] not we've had an experience with god
[15:10] and we'll go and we'll put a stake down
[15:12] and we'll walk back and pull the stake
[15:13] back out
[15:17] acting as though god is depending on us
[15:22] for our salvation but god didn't base it
[15:25] upon us he based it upon himself
[15:29] and it's going to be it's going to be
[15:32] received by grace through
[15:33] faith and that not of yourselves it's a
[15:36] gift of god
[15:39] and that faith is the only way to please
[15:41] him
[15:42] and so we need them we need to focus on
[15:46] the thing that matters
[15:47] most is what is this that god has put in
[15:50] me that believes him regardless of what
[15:52] happens
[15:53] whether i like myself today or hate
[15:55] myself i still believe god
[15:57] whether i've done good or i've done bad
[15:58] i still believe god whether things are
[16:00] going right or going wrong i still
[16:01] believe god
[16:02] no matter what happens there's something
[16:04] in me that that
[16:05] that believes this word that believes
[16:07] this truth that can't walk away that
[16:09] that can't deny the truth of the word
[16:11] what is that and where did that come
[16:13] from
[16:15] and we need to get back on a solid firm
[16:17] foundation
[16:19] brother bam says in adoption he's
[16:21] preaching adoption this is part three
[16:23] he says by faith are you saved that's
[16:24] your faith in god
[16:26] the blood keeps you clean from sin
[16:28] because it makes a sacrifice
[16:29] the blood doesn't save you the blood
[16:31] keeps you clean how do you say
[16:33] saved by faith are you saved in that by
[16:36] god's foreknowledge
[16:38] calling you you are saved and the blood
[16:40] makes an atonement
[16:42] constantly keeping you clean
[16:45] god made a provision for your salvation
[16:48] based on his will
[16:50] he willed it and he determined it before
[16:52] the foundation of the world
[16:54] amen and god had already wrote your name
[16:56] in the book and
[16:57] he was the lamb slain from before the
[16:59] foundation of the world that would pay
[17:01] the price of redemption but
[17:02] also be the atonement to keep you clean
[17:05] amen because
[17:06] god knew that although his although
[17:09] salvation was determined by god's
[17:11] foreknowledge
[17:12] that in this flesh you would need
[17:15] something to keep you
[17:16] clean so he in his foreknowledge
[17:20] provided
[17:21] amen a sacrifice for the atonement amen
[17:24] he provided a mechanism whereby you
[17:26] could be saved by faith
[17:27] he was going to ensure that the faith
[17:29] was going to be locked into the seat and
[17:31] he could unlock
[17:32] it by the light of the hour amen so he
[17:34] had programmed everything to work
[17:35] but in this life coming a wrong way
[17:38] through a fallen condition
[17:39] you are also going to need a blood
[17:41] sacrifice to keep you clean
[17:44] as you walk through this earth
[17:48] so that being said brother branham
[17:50] making the statement this way
[17:51] it's as if god knew that you would you
[17:54] would come to the realization of
[17:55] salvation you would come
[17:57] and be awakened to who you actually are
[17:59] but after that awakening
[18:01] there would still be stumblings and
[18:03] failures and fallings and backslides
[18:05] that would require blood to keep you
[18:07] clean on the journey
[18:12] so when we when we come to a place where
[18:15] we have
[18:15] need of that cleansing blood to keep us
[18:17] clean
[18:18] why do we go back when god has already
[18:21] provided this for us because he knew
[18:23] beforehand that we would need this blood
[18:25] to keep us clean
[18:26] because he knew what kind of journey we
[18:28] would be in why when we come to a place
[18:30] where we need that blood to keep us
[18:31] clean we go back to doubting whether
[18:33] we're a child of god or not
[18:41] see the statue of a perfect man is built
[18:43] on the foundation of faith
[18:44] faith is the foundation and
[18:48] and i wonder sometimes in our own minds
[18:50] if we've tried to climb in the statue of
[18:52] a perfect man before we established our
[18:54] foundation
[18:57] and made sure we knew who we were
[19:00] don't try don't try to climb don't try
[19:03] to come to anything until
[19:05] we can come to the realization that by
[19:07] the grace of god i
[19:08] am what i am
[19:13] and then build from there let's look at
[19:16] this in second peter
[19:17] ii peter chapter 1. this is where
[19:20] brother branham gets his scripture that
[19:21] he uses for the
[19:24] stature of a perfect man ii
[19:28] peter chapter 1.
[19:39] verse 4 whereby are given unto us
[19:42] exceeding great and precious promises
[19:44] that by these you might be partakers of
[19:46] the divine nature having escaped the
[19:47] corruption that is in the world through
[19:49] lust
[19:50] and beside this giving all diligence add
[19:52] to your faith
[19:53] virtue and to virtue knowledge so when
[19:56] it comes to the divine nature
[19:59] he begins with faith because everything
[20:01] for us
[20:02] starts with faith and the message of the
[20:05] statue of a perfect
[20:06] man brother bam says notice you must be
[20:08] born again and when you're born again
[20:09] you can't be born again without having
[20:11] faith
[20:12] that's right so you see on my chart here
[20:15] he's drawing the pyramid
[20:16] i got the very foundation faith is the
[20:19] foundation
[20:20] of all of it for without faith it is
[20:22] impossible to please god
[20:23] he that cometh to god must believe that
[20:25] he is and a rewarder of those that
[20:27] diligently seek him see
[20:28] he must be in when you're a skeptic of
[20:31] the bible when you're skeptic of the
[20:32] word being right you
[20:34] you just might as well stay back until
[20:36] first you believe it
[20:37] what is sin unbelief there's only two
[20:40] elements that controls the human being
[20:42] that's either doubt or faith one or the
[20:44] other
[20:44] you're possessed of one that dominates
[20:47] your life just depends on how much faith
[20:48] you have
[20:49] how high you can rise but first it's got
[20:52] to be faith
[20:53] let me stay on that foundation for a
[20:55] while now faith is what you must believe
[20:57] faith is faith is the substance of
[20:59] things hoped for
[21:01] it's your you already have it when you
[21:03] have faith
[21:04] because it's revealed in faith faith is
[21:07] the substance of things hoped for
[21:08] hebrews 11 see the evidence
[21:10] what is it what kind of evidence a holy
[21:12] evidence
[21:14] so what kind of evidence is faith a holy
[21:16] evidence
[21:17] what kind of evidence do you have that
[21:19] you're a child of god a holy evidence
[21:22] why because i believe you know it sounds
[21:26] so
[21:26] it sounds so trivial but there's a
[21:28] difference between intellectual faith
[21:30] and real faith the real genuine faith of
[21:33] the heart is not an intellectual faith
[21:34] it's not trained it's not taught
[21:36] it's not schooled amen but it's
[21:38] something that comes from
[21:39] deeper on the inside it's not the mind
[21:41] but deep inside
[21:43] there's something that says by the grace
[21:45] of god i am who i
[21:46] am amen i know that i come from god and
[21:48] i go to god
[21:49] amen i'm not what i ought to be i'm not
[21:52] what i want to be
[21:54] but thank god i'm not what i used to be
[21:58] let's go to romans 4. i'm just laying
[22:00] these scriptures in and i want to lay
[22:01] them in tight
[22:02] romans chapter 4. we read this just a
[22:05] couple weeks ago and i'm going to read
[22:06] it again
[22:08] romans 4 chapter 1.
[22:16] what shall we say then that abraham our
[22:19] father has pertained the
[22:21] flesh hath found for if abraham were
[22:23] justified by works he hath whereof to
[22:25] glory but not before god
[22:26] for what saith the scripture abraham
[22:28] believed god and it was counted unto him
[22:30] for righteousness
[22:32] now him that worketh is the reward not
[22:34] reckoned of grace
[22:35] but of dead now this scripture these
[22:38] scriptures
[22:39] are so familiar they're so familiar to
[22:42] us we've taught on them so many times
[22:44] that i don't want to blow by them
[22:45] because these things are going to become
[22:47] intricately important later
[22:49] because when jesus shows up on the scene
[22:51] and he begins
[22:52] when he has his ministry there two
[22:54] thousand years ago
[22:55] amen he is he's walking around and he's
[22:58] seeking
[22:59] he's come to seek and to save that which
[23:01] was lost
[23:02] so he's looking for something that
[23:04] belongs to him
[23:06] that's lost amen he's not trying to take
[23:09] something that's not his and make it his
[23:11] he's looking for his own
[23:14] and while he's looking for his own amen
[23:16] there's a mechanism by which he's going
[23:18] to be able to draw
[23:19] his amen and he's going to draw his by
[23:22] the revealed word for the hour by the
[23:24] manifestation of the word
[23:25] will draw the elect sheep amen but it
[23:28] wasn't who it looked like it should be
[23:30] because it was not the pharisees and the
[23:32] sadducees and the religious leaders of
[23:34] the day
[23:35] there were some who believed but the
[23:36] majority didn't believe
[23:38] amen but it was the harlot and the
[23:40] prostitute and the tax collector and the
[23:41] fishermen
[23:42] and all these ones that had no ability
[23:45] to live the kind of life that a pharisee
[23:48] was living
[23:50] so jesus was going to come on the scene
[23:53] and
[23:54] and as he's going to come on the scene
[23:55] he was going to totally disrupt
[23:57] normal thinking
[24:00] and we'll watch we're going to watch
[24:02] that as we move on but he's going to
[24:03] totally disrupt normal thinking
[24:05] but he's going to take us back to the
[24:07] fundamental faith of
[24:09] abraham because here you have a nation
[24:12] of people that consider themselves
[24:13] children of abraham
[24:14] seed of abraham amen keeping the promise
[24:17] of abraham
[24:18] and heirs to the promise of abraham and
[24:20] we find out that it was actually very
[24:22] few of those millions that were there
[24:24] that they were actual seed of abraham
[24:27] they thought they were genetically they
[24:29] thought they were by a natural heritage
[24:32] amen but they were not the faith seed of
[24:34] abraham
[24:36] so now you see so he goes back to
[24:40] abraham's justification to show that it
[24:42] was it
[24:44] predated the law abraham's justification
[24:47] abraham's choosing and his justification
[24:50] was before the law it was before
[24:51] circumcision
[24:52] and he's going to go back to these
[24:53] scriptures and show us that what was it
[24:56] that justified abraham
[24:57] amen it was abraham the fact that
[24:59] abraham believed god that was his
[25:01] justification
[25:02] and now they had gotten to a whole
[25:04] system and a whole organization
[25:06] and a whole set of rules and conducts
[25:08] and orders and beliefs that they had to
[25:10] have for justification so that
[25:12] so that the harlot couldn't attain to it
[25:14] and the woman caught in adultery
[25:16] couldn't have came to it and zacchaeus
[25:17] couldn't attain to it
[25:20] but when when jesus brought it back down
[25:22] to those
[25:23] who who be those who believe god who are
[25:26] of god or are my sheep he hear
[25:28] my voice he brought it right back to
[25:30] where abraham was
[25:33] he bypassed all the things that man had
[25:35] made it all the traditional
[25:37] understanding
[25:38] all the church and religion and jesus
[25:40] took it right
[25:41] back to the same thing that abraham had
[25:44] now the harlot could have and the woman
[25:46] caught in adultery could have
[25:48] zacchaeus could have and a fisherman
[25:50] could have and a tax collector could
[25:52] have
[25:54] and if that's the case you can have it
[25:56] and i can have it amen
[25:57] and anybody that's out there living in
[25:59] any kind of sinful condition can have it
[26:01] the same way
[26:02] it's a faith amen that's a gift that
[26:04] come from god the ability to recognize
[26:07] god in the day that you live and say
[26:08] that's nothing but the truth
[26:14] so now paul is now he was part of that
[26:17] system
[26:17] he was a pharisee of the pharisees
[26:19] concerning the law he was blameless
[26:21] amen but when jesus christ came to him
[26:23] he had something to blame him about
[26:26] in the system he was blameless amen but
[26:28] he was persecuting jesus christ he was
[26:31] persecuting the manifested word
[26:32] and jesus had something to blame him of
[26:37] and so now paul he's doing the same
[26:39] thing
[26:40] he's taking the gospel back to its
[26:43] original
[26:44] back to the foundation back to abraham
[26:49] now verse 2 again for abraham we're
[26:52] justified by works he hath whereof to
[26:54] glory but not before god
[26:56] for what saith the scripture abraham
[26:59] believed god
[27:01] and it was counted to him for
[27:02] righteousness
[27:04] what else did he do he believed god
[27:08] how did he believe god he had a gift of
[27:10] faith
[27:12] he was a predestinated sea gene of god
[27:15] and he had the capacity within him when
[27:16] he heard the voice of god for his day
[27:18] amen he had the capacity to hear it and
[27:21] to receive it and to believe it amen
[27:23] and it was accounted to him for
[27:25] righteousness now him that worketh
[27:27] is the reward not reckoned of grace but
[27:30] of debt
[27:31] but to him that worketh not but
[27:33] believeth on him that justifieth the
[27:35] ungodly
[27:36] his faith is counted for righteousness
[27:38] even as david also described the
[27:40] blessedness of the man unto whom god
[27:42] imputed righteousness
[27:43] without work saying blessed are they
[27:45] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[27:47] sins are covered
[27:49] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[27:51] not
[27:52] impute sin
[27:53] [Music]
[27:57] amen our sins are covered amen and
[27:59] righteous has been imputed on us by
[28:00] faith amen and god will not
[28:02] impute sin to that man but sometimes we
[28:04] impute it into ourselves
[28:08] by wrong thinking and wrong
[28:09] understanding on the scriptures
[28:14] blessed is the man whom the lord will
[28:16] not impute sin
[28:18] i just want to just share something that
[28:20] was just come to my heart i remember as
[28:22] a boy
[28:23] growing up in the pentecostal church i
[28:25] remember giving my heart to the lord and
[28:27] coming to an altar and crying
[28:29] and wanting to serve god and wanting to
[28:30] be saved i remember that experience amen
[28:33] and i remember going out and doing
[28:35] something wrong and i remember having to
[28:37] repeat that experience again
[28:41] and i remember going out and failing
[28:42] again and i remember having to come to
[28:44] the altar and repeat that experience
[28:45] again
[28:48] you see the problem was it was wrong
[28:50] teaching
[28:52] not that the repentance was wrong but
[28:54] that i was i was literally afraid that
[28:58] the time between that i
[29:00] the the time between that i failed god
[29:02] and failed his word
[29:03] to my death if i didn't have an
[29:05] opportunity to repent that i would die
[29:06] and be lost forever
[29:08] that's the way it was taught that's why
[29:11] people
[29:12] run to crash scenes to try to get
[29:13] somebody to pray for last minute just
[29:15] repeat after me
[29:16] or run to a parent's bedside just to get
[29:18] them to hear the word repent
[29:19] make this right you know because because
[29:21] they they think that
[29:23] that you can have something and then
[29:25] lose it
[29:28] and then in order to be saved and to go
[29:30] to heaven you have to regain it again
[29:32] before your death
[29:34] now when it comes to repentance and
[29:36] reconciliation and makes things right
[29:38] that's all true
[29:39] but when it comes to your salvation
[29:40] that's not true
[29:43] amen because that you if you're a child
[29:46] of god an election of god you were
[29:47] ordained before the foundation of the
[29:49] world
[29:50] you can no more be lost in god can be
[29:52] lost
[29:54] the message of the hours brought us
[29:56] correct teaching to wipe away that
[29:57] denominational teaching
[29:59] but unfortunately some of us had that
[30:01] ingrained in our mind before we came to
[30:02] the message
[30:03] and it takes a while to wash all of that
[30:05] out
[30:07] we may have got it from parents and we
[30:08] may have got it from preachers and we
[30:10] may have got it from one another we may
[30:12] have got it from our own human reasoning
[30:14] but we have to go back to the foundation
[30:16] that if i have ever been a son of god i
[30:17] have always been a son of god and i will
[30:19] always be a son of god
[30:22] that despite my failures my shortcomings
[30:25] my
[30:25] my personality things that i hate my my
[30:27] mistakes
[30:28] amen if i was ever part of god i'm
[30:30] always part of god and god is not losing
[30:33] himself
[30:34] and what could even give me the capacity
[30:37] as a total failure in life to believe
[30:38] that i can be part of god
[30:40] because there's something more than my
[30:41] brain amen there's something more than
[30:43] my willpower
[30:44] something more than my strength that has
[30:46] inside of me a desire for god
[30:48] it keeps bringing me back to him and an
[30:50] ability to accept his word
[30:52] the way he brings it in this day
[30:55] it's more than my mind it's more than my
[30:57] upbringing it's more than even my own
[30:59] will
[31:01] my will has failed me to be a son of god
[31:03] but the the faith inside of me has not
[31:06] failed amen
[31:07] my will and my desire and my passions to
[31:10] be a son of god to be a good christian
[31:12] to be
[31:13] a message believer all of those have
[31:15] failed me every one of them have failed
[31:17] me but there's one thing that hasn't
[31:19] failed
[31:19] that little c gene on the inside has
[31:21] never failed
[31:25] we got to come back to that foundation
[31:27] and quit being tossed about
[31:29] by every wind and every little happening
[31:31] and everything amen because we're never
[31:33] getting on to the place we need to be
[31:35] because we're constantly fooling around
[31:37] with first base
[31:40] we're constantly fooling around with
[31:42] well what am i am i this am i that
[31:44] and you know i say let's settle the
[31:47] question
[31:49] say god am i yours amen am i yours
[31:52] and and put the stake down when god
[31:54] comes and reveals himself to you
[31:56] and reveals who you are to you drive
[31:58] that stake down and don't dig it up
[32:00] again and don't go back to the
[32:01] foundation
[32:02] move on with god
[32:05] we have some of us that have that have
[32:07] hung around
[32:08] amen on the foundation way too long
[32:12] where we had an experience with god we
[32:15] had a change in our heart we had a
[32:17] literal
[32:18] change supernatural event that took
[32:20] place in our lives that
[32:21] moved us from one direction to another
[32:23] amen that put our heart and affection on
[32:25] god
[32:26] amen but because of wrong teaching
[32:28] something had us
[32:29] question that
[32:33] and we haven't been able to stop
[32:35] questioning that
[32:37] and because of that because we become so
[32:39] fixated on that
[32:41] we're not even able to do the greater
[32:42] works
[32:45] or what god has put us on this earth to
[32:47] do he didn't put us here to stay at the
[32:49] foundation but we're supposed to grow
[32:51] into the head in all things and become
[32:53] the image of jesus christ
[32:58] so let's keep reading
[33:01] verse 9 cometh as blessing this then
[33:04] upon the circumcision only or upon the
[33:06] uncircumcision also for we say that
[33:09] faith
[33:10] was reckoned to abraham for
[33:11] righteousness how was it then reckoned
[33:13] when he was
[33:14] in circumcision or in uncircumcision
[33:17] not in circumcision but in
[33:18] uncircumcision
[33:21] and he received a sign of circumcision a
[33:23] seal of the righteousness of the faith
[33:24] which he had yet
[33:25] being uncircumcised and he might be the
[33:28] father of
[33:29] all them that believe though they be not
[33:31] circumcised that
[33:32] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[33:35] also
[33:36] what he's doing here is he's unbraiding
[33:38] the jews saying
[33:39] that that it wasn't just in circumcision
[33:42] it wasn't just
[33:43] for all the jews that have come to the
[33:44] law of circumcision and come
[33:46] after father abraham and the natural no
[33:48] he says abraham got this before he even
[33:50] got circumcision
[33:52] so it applies to all
[33:57] and he can be the father of all
[34:02] let's go to verse 12 and the father
[34:06] of circumcision to them who are not of
[34:07] circumcision only but who also
[34:10] walk in the steps of that faith of our
[34:12] father abraham
[34:13] which he had being yet uncircumcised
[34:17] for the promise that he should be the
[34:18] heir of the world was not to abraham or
[34:20] to his seed through the law
[34:22] but through the righteousness of faith
[34:25] for
[34:25] they which are of the law be heirs faith
[34:27] is made void
[34:28] and the promise made of none effect
[34:31] because the law worketh wrath for their
[34:33] where no law
[34:34] is there is no transgression therefore
[34:36] it is a faith that it might be by grace
[34:39] to the end the promise might be sure to
[34:41] all the seed
[34:42] not to that only which is of the law but
[34:44] to that also which is of the faith of
[34:46] abraham
[34:46] who is the father of us all as it is
[34:49] written i have made thee a father of
[34:51] many nations
[34:52] before him whom he believed even god who
[34:55] quickeneth
[34:55] the dead and calleth those things which
[34:57] be not as though they are
[34:59] as though they were who against hope
[35:01] believed in hope that he might become
[35:03] the father of many nations according
[35:05] to that which was spoken so shall thy
[35:07] seed be
[35:08] and being not weak in faith he
[35:10] considered not his own body now
[35:11] dead when he was about a hundred years
[35:13] old neither yet the deadness of sarah's
[35:15] womb
[35:16] he staggered not at the promised promise
[35:18] of god through unbelief
[35:19] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[35:22] god and being fully persuaded
[35:24] that what he had promised he was able
[35:26] also to perform
[35:28] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[35:31] righteousness
[35:32] now it was not written for his sake
[35:34] alone that it was imputed to him
[35:36] but for us also to whom it shall be
[35:38] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[35:41] up jesus our lord from the dead
[35:43] who was delivered for our offenses and
[35:44] was raised again for our justification
[35:48] so the fact that righteousness was
[35:50] imputed for abraham to believe
[35:52] was not just for abraham but it was for
[35:54] me and it was for you
[35:56] amen who can believe the way abraham
[35:58] believed abraham believed against hope
[36:00] he believed in hope against hope
[36:01] he believed what seemed to be impossible
[36:03] he believed the word of god
[36:05] when it was impossible for him to
[36:06] perform the word of god he believed it
[36:08] nonetheless
[36:09] when his body could not cooperate with
[36:11] what god had said
[36:12] he still believed the word when sarah's
[36:14] body would not cooperate he still
[36:16] believed the word
[36:17] and that faith in god and god alone
[36:19] without
[36:20] his ability amen
[36:23] oh let this come home friends let it
[36:25] come home
[36:26] abraham had no option but to believe god
[36:29] because he had no ability to perform the
[36:31] promise
[36:35] oh i wish we could get weak and feeble
[36:38] and needy and incredible
[36:40] and unable amen and quit trying to think
[36:42] that we can do something and if we do it
[36:44] right amen we'll be all right and get to
[36:46] the fact get to where abraham was
[36:48] when the promise came abraham and sarah
[36:51] tried to use a little intellect and a
[36:52] little reasoning and try to help god out
[36:54] and all they did was produce an ishmael
[36:59] but when they finally gave up on that
[37:01] and realized there's nothing i can do
[37:03] amen
[37:03] there's nothing i can do to make this
[37:05] happen amen and i believe
[37:07] anyways i believe without any ability in
[37:10] my body i believe without
[37:11] any ability in sarah's body and i
[37:13] believe without any workaround
[37:17] a handmaid or a
[37:21] he believed against hope
[37:25] i believe god is perfecting his bride
[37:27] and i believe god is perfecting me
[37:30] without my help
[37:33] amen i believe god is going to use me to
[37:37] do the greater works
[37:38] without my help amen he's going to do it
[37:41] because he said he's going to do it he's
[37:42] going to do it because he's promised to
[37:43] do it he's going to do it because it's
[37:45] his will and because he's able
[37:46] and all he needs is somebody who can
[37:48] believe and hope against hope
[37:50] amen who can believe i can come to the
[37:52] very nature of jesus christ
[37:53] and this body amen i can come to the
[37:56] very reflection of christ
[37:57] in this form
[38:01] how are you going to do it it's not
[38:02] going to be any of my old way of
[38:04] thinking or any of my old habits or any
[38:05] of my old attempts
[38:06] they all failed it's going to be a
[38:08] complete surrender to him and let jesus
[38:10] christ live his life through me
[38:13] it won't be me it'll be him i've already
[38:15] proved i can't do it abraham proved he
[38:17] couldn't
[38:18] do it in fact there was a time in
[38:20] abraham's life
[38:21] where he still could produce the promise
[38:24] but sarah couldn't
[38:26] and that was a deceptive time
[38:30] in the deception of him being able to do
[38:32] something about it
[38:33] but his wife not they came up with a
[38:35] plan that would work
[38:37] god's will amen by their own reasoning
[38:39] and she gave hagar
[38:41] because he was still capable and she
[38:42] wasn't and it looked like it was going
[38:44] to work amen but it wasn't amen that
[38:46] wasn't the plan of god
[38:48] and it was failure
[38:52] but praise god when he had no more hope
[38:56] when his stream of life had dried up and
[38:59] he couldn't even produce
[39:01] through a through a maid anymore the
[39:03] promise
[39:04] that's when he still believed
[39:10] if you've tried and failed and tried
[39:14] and failed and you've come to the point
[39:16] where he says
[39:17] i can't do it then you can express the
[39:20] faith of abraham now
[39:22] now's the time to believe in hope
[39:25] against hope amen
[39:26] to have hope against all hope
[39:30] now i want to read something here in
[39:32] romans in the last verse because i don't
[39:33] want our minds to go to the wrong place
[39:36] and verse 24 it says but for us also to
[39:39] whom it shall be imputed
[39:40] if we believe on him that raised up
[39:43] jesus our lord from the dead
[39:45] so the the key is always to believe god
[39:49] that's the key always to believe god but
[39:52] i want to go to a couple scriptures so
[39:53] we don't lose sight
[39:54] of how god works let's go to matthew
[39:57] chapter 10.
[40:02] so you have to believe on him who raised
[40:03] up jesus from the dead so you have to
[40:05] believe in god
[40:08] matthew chapter 10 verse 40.
[40:15] he that receiveth you receive with me
[40:18] and he that receiveth me receive with
[40:20] him that sent me
[40:24] so there's still a modern day way to
[40:27] believe god
[40:30] let's go to luke chapter 10.
[40:39] luke chapter 10 verse 16
[40:44] he that heareth you heareth me and he
[40:47] that despiseth you despises me
[40:49] and he that despises me despiseth him
[40:52] that sent me
[40:55] so we have to believe on god but he says
[40:58] if they hear you my disciples they hear
[41:00] me if they hear me they hear him that
[41:02] sent me
[41:04] if they despise you they despise me that
[41:06] despise me despise him that sent me
[41:09] so you see today there's still a voice
[41:13] of god on earth
[41:15] today there's still a voice there's
[41:17] still a word that's going out that's
[41:19] coming from god declaring a promise of
[41:21] god
[41:22] amen and you still have to believe on
[41:24] him who raised up jesus from the dead
[41:25] but believing on him you have to believe
[41:27] on who he sends
[41:30] to do the works of god you have to
[41:31] believe on who he sins and jesus was
[41:33] sending his disciples and if you heard
[41:35] if you heard who he sent you heard him
[41:37] if you heard him you heard who sent him
[41:40] and then you have the faith of abraham
[41:42] but if you despise who he sent
[41:44] then you despise him the new spies the
[41:46] one who sent him and you have not the
[41:48] faith of abraham
[41:50] so we can't leave this couple thousand
[41:52] years ago we got to bring it up right
[41:53] now today
[41:56] there's still the testing for the
[41:58] children of abraham
[42:02] let's go to john chapter 8.
[42:09] john chapter 8 and verse 45.
[42:18] and because i tell you the truth you
[42:20] believe me not
[42:23] which of you convinces me of sin and if
[42:25] i say the truth
[42:26] why do you not believe me he that is of
[42:29] god
[42:29] heareth god's words ye therefore hear
[42:32] them not
[42:33] because you are not of god
[42:41] the only way to hear god's word is to be
[42:43] of god
[42:47] let's go back to john chapter 6 and
[42:49] verse 35.
[42:52] there's much that we can say here but
[42:53] i'm just going to drop a couple points
[42:54] in and move on
[42:56] there's a lot we could say
[42:59] john chapter 6 35 and jesus said unto
[43:02] them
[43:03] i am the bread of life
[43:06] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[43:08] and he that believeth on me shall never
[43:10] thirst
[43:11] but i said unto you that you also have
[43:13] seen me and believe not
[43:15] all that the father giveth me shall come
[43:17] to me and him that cometh to me i will
[43:19] in no wise
[43:20] cast out for i come down from heaven not
[43:22] to do my own will
[43:24] but the will of him that sent me and
[43:26] this is the father's will which has sent
[43:28] me that of all which he hath given me
[43:30] i should lose nothing but should raise
[43:33] it up again in the last day
[43:35] and this is the will of him that sent me
[43:37] that every one that which seeth
[43:40] which seeth the son and believeth on him
[43:43] may have everlasting life
[43:44] and i will raise him up at the last day
[43:48] this is interesting this is an
[43:50] interesting bit of language because
[43:52] don't just read the bible and just miss
[43:54] it
[43:55] but in order to be saved and raised at
[43:57] the end time you have to see
[43:59] the sun
[44:02] well this will destroy denominational
[44:04] thinking
[44:05] because if you have to see the sun and
[44:07] the sun was only in one form in the
[44:09] flesh form of jesus christ two thousand
[44:11] years ago
[44:12] well i haven't seen that amen unless i
[44:14] look at a an artist's rendition or
[44:17] whatever no but you can still see the
[44:19] son today
[44:21] because he is still manifest amen he's
[44:23] manifest on the earth and you can still
[44:25] see the sun
[44:27] and you must see the sun report of them
[44:31] but of all that the father's given him
[44:35] he will lose none that is
[44:39] his commitment and that's the father's
[44:41] commandment amen that's
[44:42] not your desire this is something we
[44:45] have to come down to and come
[44:47] let it come home and let it drive deep
[44:48] into your heart amen
[44:50] it's not you that wants god as god wants
[44:53] you
[44:53] amen the only desire you have is a
[44:56] reflection back of the desire he had for
[44:58] you
[44:58] and so we've got to we've got to realize
[45:00] that he came looking for the lost sheep
[45:02] the lost sheep didn't
[45:04] find the shepherd amen he came he left
[45:06] the 99 to find the one
[45:10] he he's the one who came he sought you
[45:12] out he found you
[45:14] you were his before you were lost but
[45:16] now you're found
[45:17] amen it wasn't adam who was calling out
[45:19] for god it was god who was calling out
[45:21] for adam
[45:23] setting the stage for what he would do
[45:25] for his sons for the rest of the bible
[45:29] and so we've got to come to terms with
[45:31] the fact that god will not lose his
[45:33] sheep
[45:34] and if i have something in me says i'm
[45:36] one of his sheep i will
[45:38] not be lost no man will pluck him out of
[45:42] the father's hand no one will pluck him
[45:44] out of the son's hand
[45:45] there's no sheep is going to be lost
[45:51] so we need to come to terms with that
[45:54] and know how to see the son in our day
[45:58] and how to hear the voice of god how do
[46:00] we hear the voice of god
[46:02] in our day amen you hear the word made
[46:05] manifest
[46:07] how do we see the son we see the son of
[46:10] man
[46:11] amen made manifest he's here today
[46:15] still working
[46:18] let's go to mark chapter 2. now i want
[46:20] to get into where i really wanted to get
[46:22] to
[46:24] mark chapter 2.
[46:32] i'm still i'm wanting to hammer this
[46:34] foundation down so hard
[46:37] and i feel like i could preach this
[46:38] every day
[46:40] to myself
[46:43] because we we got to have confidence in
[46:46] the word of god
[46:48] and our own actions our conduct and our
[46:50] own speech
[46:52] it betrays us sometimes it betrays the
[46:55] unbeliever in our minds
[46:58] because we speak in a way that leaves
[47:01] god out of the equation
[47:03] we speak in a way that puts our
[47:05] salvation on our own shoulders
[47:08] we speak in a way that puts our own
[47:10] keeping in our own shoulders
[47:12] and and we've got to get away from that
[47:14] language and get back to the language of
[47:16] the bible
[47:17] if if you have failed miserably today
[47:20] that means you're a son or daughter of
[47:22] god who has failed miserably today
[47:26] so could i repeat that for you you're a
[47:28] son or daughter of god who has failed
[47:30] miserably today
[47:34] that's still a good place to be
[47:38] you're not losing your sonship you're
[47:40] not losing your place in god that was
[47:42] established before
[47:43] before there was a molecule before there
[47:44] was stardust before
[47:46] before god was even god
[47:50] before he was an object of worship
[47:52] before there was anything to worship and
[47:53] before there was anything in the visible
[47:55] realm
[47:55] when there was an invisible god dwelling
[47:57] alone with his thoughts
[47:58] you were there and you were part of him
[48:00] amen and this message has come to bring
[48:03] us back to that realization so that
[48:04] we're not
[48:05] shaken amen by everything that goes on
[48:07] around us so that we have confidence in
[48:09] god
[48:13] how how is it that we're going to walk
[48:15] in this life amen how is it we're going
[48:17] to overcome
[48:18] things are getting darker amen there's
[48:20] going to be it's going to become
[48:22] more difficult as time goes on and we've
[48:24] realized it's not gotten
[48:25] easier it's getting harder but we've got
[48:29] to have
[48:29] something solid under our feet to keep
[48:32] moving and know that we're a child of
[48:33] god and god
[48:34] will provide for me and god has called
[48:35] me in this day and if he's called me in
[48:37] this day
[48:38] there's something he wants to accomplish
[48:39] and he will accomplish it and all i have
[48:41] to do is stand still and let god be god
[48:45] i gotta quit doubting i gotta quit
[48:47] questioning i just got to say god is god
[48:49] and i am his
[48:50] and i'm part of the program and he's
[48:52] going to do what he's going to do
[48:56] we're going to see i'm going to see the
[48:58] supernatural
[49:00] how do you know because i have no
[49:02] capacity to move this mountain he's
[49:03] i'm going to believe in him and he's
[49:05] going to do it amen
[49:08] because this is his plan his program
[49:11] this is his calling this is this is his
[49:13] this is his great drama that he saw in
[49:16] the in his mind before
[49:18] anything was ever made and i'm just
[49:21] going to trust in him
[49:25] you see we can never get to the faith to
[49:27] move a mountain
[49:28] if we're still not sure who we are
[49:32] and if we still are are doubting our
[49:34] relationship with god based off our
[49:36] conduct
[49:38] but we got to go back to a security that
[49:41] helps us to overcome all of those things
[49:44] mark chapter 2 verse 1
[49:48] mark chapter 2 verse 1. and again he
[49:51] entered into capernaum after some days
[49:53] and it was
[49:54] noise that he was in the house and
[49:56] straight may many were gathered
[49:58] together in so much that there was no
[49:59] room to receive them
[50:01] no not so much as about the door and he
[50:03] preached the word unto them
[50:05] and they came unto him bringing one sick
[50:07] of the palsy which was born
[50:09] born of four and when they could not
[50:12] come nigh unto the
[50:13] unto him for the press they uncovered
[50:15] the roof where he was
[50:16] and when they had broke it up they let
[50:18] down the bed therein
[50:20] wherein the sick of the palsy lay when
[50:23] jesus
[50:24] saw their faith
[50:27] he said unto the sycapals his son thy
[50:30] sins be forgiven thee
[50:33] there's a reason that we read this so
[50:36] pay attention we're going to read the
[50:37] few stories like this
[50:38] but he says son thy sins be forgiven
[50:42] thee
[50:44] what did the man do what good works
[50:48] what acts of kindness where did he go
[50:51] make something right what pendants did
[50:53] he do
[50:54] where was his evidence where was his
[50:55] fruit what did he
[50:58] he knew that this was the power of god
[51:02] and he knew that god was in that man and
[51:05] he knew he
[51:06] and his friends knew that they had to
[51:08] get him who was sick of the palsy
[51:10] to that man because god was there amen
[51:13] and when i got there amen he knew that
[51:15] he would be healed that's why his
[51:16] friends peel back the thatching and the
[51:18] tile of the roof amen to drop him down
[51:20] because they
[51:21] already know that there will be results
[51:22] because they already know who's there
[51:26] and when jesus saw their faith he looked
[51:29] at the man that was sick
[51:30] and he says what did he say
[51:35] thy sins be forgiven thee
[51:38] based off what based off the fact that
[51:41] he could believe
[51:48] keep reading but there were certain of
[51:50] the scribes sitting there
[51:51] reasoning in their hearts why did this
[51:53] man thus speak blasphemies
[51:55] who can forgive sins but god only and
[51:57] immediately when jesus perceived in a
[51:59] spirit that they
[52:00] so reasoned within themselves he said
[52:02] unto them why reason
[52:04] you these things in your hearts whether
[52:06] is it easier to say to the sick of palsy
[52:08] thy sins be forgiven thee
[52:09] or to say arise and take up thy bed and
[52:11] walk but that
[52:13] ye may know that the son of man has
[52:14] power on earth to forgive
[52:16] sins he saith to the sick of the palsy i
[52:18] say unto thee arise and take up thy bed
[52:21] and go thy way into thine house
[52:23] and immediately he arose took up the bed
[52:25] and went forth before them
[52:27] all in so much that they were all amazed
[52:29] and glorified god saying we never saw it
[52:31] on
[52:32] this fashion now listen
[52:36] they were amazed when that man took up
[52:38] his bed
[52:40] and began walking they were astonished
[52:42] they were amazed
[52:43] but i tell you what's more amazing was
[52:45] jesus looked at a man
[52:47] who did nothing didn't sacrifice
[52:49] something at the altar
[52:50] amen didn't make a pledge didn't make a
[52:52] vow but he just acted upon the faith
[52:54] that was in his heart and he got in the
[52:56] presence of jesus and jesus knew what
[52:58] was in him and what motivated him to get
[53:00] there and before he had an action before
[53:01] he had a conduct before he had a promise
[53:03] he would look at him and says thy sins
[53:05] are forgiven you
[53:06] amen to me if i could have one or the
[53:08] other i'd say leave me on the bed and
[53:10] forgive my sins
[53:13] but people are we're so fickle we're as
[53:15] human beings we're so
[53:16] caught up in the natural that we miss
[53:18] what's the greatest thing of all
[53:22] that this man didn't have to go to the
[53:24] temple he didn't have to give turtle
[53:26] doves he didn't have to
[53:27] he didn't have to slay a goat or a sheep
[53:29] all he had to do was recognize the
[53:31] living word for his day
[53:33] amen and by acting faith amen and when
[53:35] jesus saw his faith
[53:36] he immediately declared his sins
[53:40] forgiven
[53:43] and if that worked there does it work
[53:45] today amen is he still the same god
[53:47] operating by the same law is it still
[53:49] the same thing abraham had or is it
[53:51] something different today
[53:53] and i'd like to go on the record saying
[53:55] it's the same salvation it's the same
[53:57] imputation of righteousness
[53:58] it's the same god with the same plan as
[54:00] he's always had
[54:02] he's looking for somebody that can
[54:04] recognize the son that can see the son
[54:06] that can hear the voice and that can say
[54:09] i believe
[54:10] i believe it's the truth and i know it's
[54:12] the truth and he can look and say your
[54:13] sins are forgiven you
[54:15] not because you folded your hands not
[54:17] because you came to an author not
[54:18] because you acted out you may do all of
[54:20] those things that's fine but what he's
[54:22] looking at is that faith is what he's
[54:24] looking at
[54:25] somebody that'll believe him that'll
[54:27] seem for who he is for where he is for
[54:29] what he's doing
[54:33] listen the room was full of people and
[54:34] nobody else did he look at and say thy
[54:36] sins are forgiven me
[54:38] [Music]
[54:40] oh if we had the right revelation i'd
[54:42] have climbed up on the wall and said
[54:44] lower me next
[54:48] i believe i believe if it'll work for
[54:50] him it'll work for me
[54:54] that's the kind of believer i want to be
[54:56] friends
[54:59] i want to see god working and i want to
[55:00] jump in let's go to luke chapter 7.
[55:05] verse 44. i'm just going to go through a
[55:07] couple
[55:08] stories i just want you to see how clear
[55:10] this is in the scriptures
[55:17] these are basic things these are simple
[55:19] things but they're so
[55:20] fundamentally important to everyday life
[55:24] that if we move off of this foundation
[55:26] in everyday life
[55:27] we're going to wind up disheartened and
[55:29] we're going to wind up heartbroken
[55:31] and discouraged and depressed and
[55:33] uncertain and we're not going to take
[55:35] god at his word we're not going to claim
[55:36] the promise and stand on it we're not
[55:38] going to speak to the mountain
[55:39] because we're going to be we're going to
[55:40] be all uh uh in turmoil and caught up
[55:43] and uncertain
[55:44] but we've got to come back to this
[55:45] foundation and say no matter what
[55:46] happens
[55:47] i'm a son of god i'm a seed of god i'm
[55:49] faith seed of abraham
[55:51] god will never lose me he's done found
[55:53] me
[55:54] i'm in his hand amen and no man can
[55:56] pluck me out amen no matter what's going
[55:58] on around me i've got
[56:00] confidence in him and i've got
[56:01] confidence in what he wrote in the
[56:02] lamb's book of life amen it's been
[56:04] unsealed to me
[56:06] who i am and my name in that book and
[56:08] now nothing's going to change that
[56:11] see you can't become the master of
[56:12] circumstances till you know who you are
[56:19] luke luke chapter 7 verse 44.
[56:23] this is the house of simon and the
[56:25] pharisee and the woman come and
[56:27] she washed jesus feet she anointed him
[56:30] with oil swash them with the tears wiped
[56:32] it with her hair
[56:32] we get down to the end of the story it
[56:34] says and he turned to the woman
[56:35] and he said unto simon seest thou this
[56:38] woman
[56:39] i entered into thine house thou gaves me
[56:41] no water from my feet but she has washed
[56:44] my feet with tears and wiped them with
[56:46] the hairs of her head
[56:48] though gave us me no kiss but this woman
[56:50] since the time i came
[56:51] in hath not ceased to kiss my feet
[56:54] my head with oil thou that's not
[56:56] annoying but this woman hath anointed my
[56:58] feet with ointment
[57:00] wherefore i say unto thee her sins which
[57:02] are many
[57:03] are forgiven to catch that
[57:08] her sins which were many are forgiven
[57:12] for she loved much to whom little was
[57:14] forgiven the same loveth little
[57:16] and he said unto her thy sins
[57:20] are forgiven
[57:23] and they that sat at meat with him began
[57:26] to say within themselves
[57:27] who is this that forgiveth sins also and
[57:30] he said to the woman
[57:31] thy faith has saved thee go in peace
[57:37] it wasn't the oil it wasn't the tears
[57:41] it wasn't the hair those were all
[57:44] outcroppings of her face
[57:47] those were all that was what the spirit
[57:50] was moving her to do that was the
[57:52] inspiration she was under
[57:53] and she had faith she knew who this was
[57:55] she believed
[57:56] amen she believed that this was god god
[57:59] was working right here
[58:00] this is what's going on in our day and
[58:02] she gave everything she had to and she
[58:04] threw herself at his feet
[58:05] under inspiration of the holy ghost amen
[58:08] the inspiration is what everybody else
[58:10] saw
[58:10] amen they saw the oil the ointment the
[58:13] the hair and the tears
[58:14] amen but what jesus saw was her faith
[58:18] and he didn't say your sacrifice has
[58:20] saved you or your words have saved you
[58:22] he says your faith has saved you
[58:26] see how simple it is it's so simple we
[58:30] as human beings try to complicate it
[58:32] it's so basic so simple so easy
[58:36] that we get in our own heads and mess
[58:37] the simplicity of the gospel knob
[58:41] and then we handicap ourselves because
[58:44] of that
[58:46] luke chapter 18.
[58:55] luke chapter 18
[59:00] verse 35.
[59:04] and it came to pass that he was come
[59:06] nigh unto jericho a certain blind man
[59:08] sat by the wayside begging
[59:10] and hearing the multitude passed by he
[59:12] asked what it meant and they told him
[59:14] that jesus of nazareth passed by passed
[59:16] by
[59:17] and he cried saying jesus thou son of
[59:19] david have mercy on me
[59:21] and they which went before rebuked him
[59:23] that he should hold his peace but he
[59:24] cried so much more the more
[59:26] thou son of david had mercy on me and
[59:29] jesus stood and commanded him to be
[59:31] brought unto him
[59:32] and when he was come near he asked him
[59:34] saying what wilt thou that i shall do
[59:36] unto thee
[59:36] and he said lord that i may receive my
[59:38] sign and jesus said unto him
[59:40] receive thy sight thy faith have saved
[59:43] thee
[59:44] and immediately he received his sight
[59:45] and followed him glorifying god and all
[59:47] the people
[59:48] when they saw it gave praise unto god
[59:52] see he was crying out to the son of
[59:56] david
[59:57] he recognized that this is prophecy
[59:59] being fulfilled
[1:00:01] the pharisees wouldn't say that amen
[1:00:03] some of the other in the malta
[1:00:04] wouldn't say that but there was a blind
[1:00:05] man there who caught a revelation
[1:00:07] and said this is the very prophecy being
[1:00:10] fulfilled in our day
[1:00:12] and he cried out thou son of david and
[1:00:14] they were trying to get him to be quiet
[1:00:16] but jesus heard what he said and he said
[1:00:18] bring him to me
[1:00:19] he said what do you want he said i want
[1:00:20] to receive my side he said then receive
[1:00:22] your sight
[1:00:22] that you're saved your faith has saved
[1:00:24] you
[1:00:26] see he he had the capacity
[1:00:30] to believe that this was the day for the
[1:00:32] prophecy to be fulfilled
[1:00:35] others were doubting others were
[1:00:36] questioning others were mocking and
[1:00:38] saying horrible names about jesus but
[1:00:40] here was a little blind man
[1:00:42] amen who said down in his heart he said
[1:00:44] this is the son of david
[1:00:46] this is the prophecy this is the messiah
[1:00:51] god could see his faith there was a
[1:00:54] little woman
[1:00:54] who knew down in her heart that if i
[1:00:56] could but touch the hem of his garment
[1:00:58] i could be made every bit whole amen you
[1:01:01] realize
[1:01:01] friends this isn't it it's not that that
[1:01:04] she was repeating when anybody else had
[1:01:06] done this wasn't
[1:01:07] five steps to salvation this wasn't this
[1:01:10] wasn't the romans road to the sinner's
[1:01:12] prayer
[1:01:12] amen this was a spontaneous reaction
[1:01:15] amen an inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:01:17] amen where there was a seed on the
[1:01:18] inside that could recognize
[1:01:20] this man can help me and something is
[1:01:22] telling me that if i could just touch
[1:01:24] the hymn of his garment i could be made
[1:01:26] every bit whole
[1:01:27] this is real salvation this is real
[1:01:29] christianity this is not
[1:01:31] this is far beyond formalism and far
[1:01:33] beyond repeating after me and far beyond
[1:01:36] this step and this step and this step
[1:01:38] amen it's it's something that's
[1:01:40] down inside of an individual amen she
[1:01:42] may not have known she had that kind of
[1:01:44] faith amen the blind man didn't know he
[1:01:46] had that kind of faith the woman that
[1:01:47] washed jesus feet she may not have known
[1:01:49] she had that kind of faith
[1:01:50] but when she come in contact with the
[1:01:52] living word for her day
[1:01:53] something inside of her said i gotta get
[1:01:55] to him i've got to wash his feet
[1:01:59] amen when when blind bartimaeus was
[1:02:01] sitting at the
[1:02:02] the gate in jericho and he heard who was
[1:02:04] passing by amen that spontaneous well of
[1:02:07] faith came up
[1:02:08] and said thou son of david this is my
[1:02:11] chance this is the word for the hour
[1:02:13] this is the prophecy this is my time i'm
[1:02:16] calling out to you
[1:02:17] oh god save me
[1:02:20] do you think it'll be any different for
[1:02:21] us in this day amen what do we need to
[1:02:23] do whatever god is moving in your heart
[1:02:26] to do
[1:02:27] but to recognize who is here amen the
[1:02:29] prophecy is being fulfilled the word is
[1:02:31] made manifest
[1:02:32] you can see the sun you can hear his
[1:02:35] void the voice of the lord
[1:02:36] and you can respond in whatever way god
[1:02:38] is inspiring you to respond but he will
[1:02:40] see your faith and impute unto your
[1:02:42] righteousness
[1:02:45] and what makes us think it should be
[1:02:47] different than what abraham had
[1:02:49] or different than what the woman at the
[1:02:50] well god are different than what mary
[1:02:52] magdalene received or different than
[1:02:54] what
[1:02:55] blind bartimaeus got it may have come in
[1:02:58] a different way for each of them but it
[1:02:59] was based on the same thing
[1:03:01] it was based on their faith in the
[1:03:03] living word of god
[1:03:09] your story may be different in my story
[1:03:11] the inspiration that hit me
[1:03:13] i wept some dance one ran amen some
[1:03:16] brother branham went down the road
[1:03:18] jumping in the air and beating the air
[1:03:20] and shadowboxing
[1:03:25] your story may not look like my story
[1:03:27] but somehow i recognize this is him
[1:03:31] this is him amen and he can save me he
[1:03:33] can heal me
[1:03:34] amen this is the truth and he recognized
[1:03:37] my faith
[1:03:38] amen and he saved my soul
[1:03:42] don't complicate it friends don't make
[1:03:45] it difficult amen
[1:03:46] make it make it your story the reality
[1:03:48] that struck your heart
[1:03:50] the realization of who's speaking in
[1:03:52] this day the realization of who's
[1:03:53] present among us amen
[1:03:55] what this prophecy means what this word
[1:03:57] being fulfilled means
[1:03:58] amen and love it amen give yourself to
[1:04:00] it cry out to it
[1:04:02] whatever you have to do but just let him
[1:04:04] know lord i recognize you this is you
[1:04:06] and i love you
[1:04:10] don't worry he sees your faith
[1:04:14] even if nobody else sees it he sees it
[1:04:19] let's look at luke 19.
[1:04:24] luke chapter 19 we'll read verse 1.
[1:04:29] and jesus entered and passed through
[1:04:31] jericho
[1:04:32] and behold there was a man named
[1:04:33] zacchaeus which was the chief among the
[1:04:36] publicans
[1:04:37] and he was rich and he sought to see
[1:04:39] jesus
[1:04:40] who he was and could not for the press
[1:04:42] because he was little of stature
[1:04:44] and he ran before and climbed up into a
[1:04:47] sycamore tree to see him for he was
[1:04:49] to pass that way and when jesus come to
[1:04:52] the place he looked up and he saw
[1:04:55] he saw him and he said unto him
[1:04:56] zacchaeus make haste and come down
[1:04:58] for today i must abide at thy house
[1:05:02] and he made haste and he come down and
[1:05:03] received him joyfully
[1:05:05] and when they saw it they all murmured
[1:05:07] saying that he was gone to be guest with
[1:05:09] a man
[1:05:10] that is a sinner and i'm going to stop
[1:05:13] right here
[1:05:14] and say jesus he never
[1:05:18] if we read through the gospels read
[1:05:20] through the scriptures we never have
[1:05:22] record of jesus complaining about
[1:05:24] sinners
[1:05:28] and we don't have jesus campaigning
[1:05:30] against abortion
[1:05:33] trying to close down all the beer joints
[1:05:37] do you understand jesus wasn't trying to
[1:05:40] stop prostitution and he wasn't trying
[1:05:42] to stop
[1:05:42] gambling do you have you read the bible
[1:05:49] jesus wasn't trying to bring a
[1:05:51] governments about
[1:05:56] you see the fallacy of denominationalism
[1:05:58] and christian thinking
[1:06:02] jesus's complaint his frustration
[1:06:05] was the unbelief in the religious
[1:06:07] systems
[1:06:09] he didn't talk about the prostitute and
[1:06:11] how horrible that was and
[1:06:13] the drunkard and how terrible that was
[1:06:15] he addressed the religion that was
[1:06:17] holding the people back from the truth
[1:06:19] that was what was horrible to him
[1:06:26] jesus could look at the system and he
[1:06:28] could complain about the pharisees and
[1:06:29] he'd call them
[1:06:30] he you know he didn't tell the
[1:06:32] prostitutes she was of her father the
[1:06:33] devil
[1:06:35] he said that to religious leaders
[1:06:39] because the prostitute was one of the
[1:06:41] sheep he was looking for
[1:06:43] and when he come in contact with that
[1:06:45] prostitute she believed him
[1:06:47] amen and he knew that she was a child of
[1:06:49] god
[1:06:50] but the pharisee was a child of the
[1:06:52] devil because that he was rejecting the
[1:06:54] word made flesh
[1:07:00] we have to be careful that 2000 years
[1:07:02] the denomination doesn't taint our
[1:07:03] understanding of the bible
[1:07:10] so now they're all worried and upset
[1:07:14] because jesus is going to the house of a
[1:07:16] sinner
[1:07:18] but jesus only that which the father
[1:07:20] showed him
[1:07:21] he knew this was a lost sheep
[1:07:25] he's only he's only sinner
[1:07:29] temporarily
[1:07:32] because he's really a believer he just
[1:07:34] doesn't know it yet
[1:07:36] he's really a child of god he just
[1:07:38] hasn't had the opportunity to express
[1:07:40] it yet you see what i'm saying
[1:07:44] so he says verse 7 again and when they
[1:07:47] saw it they all murmured saying
[1:07:49] that he was gone to be a guest with a
[1:07:51] man that is a sinner
[1:07:52] and zach he has stood and said unto the
[1:07:54] lord behold lord
[1:07:55] the half of my goods i give to the poor
[1:07:58] and if i have taken anything from any
[1:07:59] man by false accusation
[1:08:01] i restore him fourfold and jesus said
[1:08:03] unto him
[1:08:04] this day is salvation come to this house
[1:08:07] for as much as he
[1:08:08] also is a son of abraham
[1:08:11] for the son of man has come to seek and
[1:08:13] to save that
[1:08:15] which was lost
[1:08:18] he made the declaration listen it looks
[1:08:21] almost like
[1:08:22] he made it based off zacchaeus promise
[1:08:24] but listen
[1:08:25] jesus declared salvation coming and
[1:08:28] zacchaeus lost before zacchaeus did one
[1:08:30] of those things that he promised to do
[1:08:32] what was it what was it that zacchaeus
[1:08:35] was doing amen it was the same thing the
[1:08:37] woman that the well was doing it was the
[1:08:38] same thing the woman that washed his
[1:08:40] feet was doing
[1:08:40] it was the same thing blind bartimaeus
[1:08:42] was doing he came in contact with the
[1:08:44] living word and it changed him and he
[1:08:46] stood up and said
[1:08:47] i don't want to be like this anymore i'm
[1:08:49] going to make everything right
[1:08:50] and it wasn't the declaration of making
[1:08:52] it right or the action of making it
[1:08:54] right
[1:08:54] that brought salvation to his house it
[1:08:56] was his ability to recognize
[1:08:59] the lord jesus christ and and change
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:02] and have a change of heart and want to
[1:09:04] be different
[1:09:10] what if zacchaeus forgot
[1:09:13] one of those people he cheated
[1:09:17] jesus already made the declaration
[1:09:19] salvation has come to this house
[1:09:21] because he believed not because he got
[1:09:24] every penny paid back just right
[1:09:27] and he didn't forget and he had good
[1:09:28] letters and he went back and after he
[1:09:30] made it all right and proved that what
[1:09:31] he said was true and
[1:09:32] then god says okay now i've come back
[1:09:34] and i've checked and forgot this and
[1:09:36] you're off by 10 cents
[1:09:40] but that's how we think
[1:09:44] sometimes we've i've talked to i've
[1:09:46] talked to a lot of people brothers
[1:09:47] and sisters i've talked to a lot and my
[1:09:49] heart just breaks you have people get
[1:09:51] twisted around by the devil
[1:09:52] and and they've been saved they've given
[1:09:54] their heart to the lord had an
[1:09:55] experience with the lord and ten years
[1:09:57] later they're wondering about
[1:09:58] i don't remember if i went back and
[1:10:00] repented for everything i ever did wrong
[1:10:02] it's like are you kidding me do you
[1:10:04] think god
[1:10:05] is requiring that you remember amen when
[1:10:08] you were 10 years old and you took your
[1:10:09] brother's hot wheel never gave it back
[1:10:11] to him
[1:10:12] amen you're repenting for your unbelief
[1:10:14] you're repenting for not
[1:10:15] recognizing the lord and when you
[1:10:17] recognize him you're giving yourself to
[1:10:19] him
[1:10:19] it's not going back and saying i took
[1:10:21] this from you and i took that from you
[1:10:23] and remember the other day
[1:10:27] and we've had people who questioned
[1:10:29] their new birth they may
[1:10:30] question whether or not based off
[1:10:32] something they remembered that they
[1:10:33] hadn't made right and they thought they
[1:10:34] made it right
[1:10:35] should i go back and make this writer
[1:10:37] should i go back and say something
[1:10:44] just believe him just believe him
[1:10:48] if he moves on your heart to go make
[1:10:50] something right go make it right
[1:10:52] but don't base your salvation on that
[1:10:56] if god brings a conviction on your heart
[1:10:59] and he brings a memory to you something
[1:11:01] that you need to go and reconcile
[1:11:02] go reconcile it but don't put your
[1:11:04] salvation in your walk on the lord
[1:11:06] on hold and say i i i'm not even off
[1:11:08] first base now i thought i was the third
[1:11:10] base i thought i was rounding the home
[1:11:11] but i'm not
[1:11:12] i'm not even off the starting line i got
[1:11:13] to go back and make this right and then
[1:11:14] i got to come back to the beginning
[1:11:18] just believe him just give him your
[1:11:20] whole heart just believe him
[1:11:21] just believing for who he is in this day
[1:11:24] believe the lord and if he moves on you
[1:11:26] to make something right make it right
[1:11:29] and just let that be your father dealing
[1:11:31] with the son
[1:11:35] but don't go back to doubting whether or
[1:11:37] not you're saved or born again
[1:11:39] amen because i remember that when i
[1:11:41] repented i don't know if i fully
[1:11:42] repented i might need to get baptized
[1:11:44] again because i remember that i didn't
[1:11:46] fully
[1:11:48] amen the devil is just twisting people
[1:11:52] up
[1:11:55] jesus didn't do these people this way
[1:11:59] when he saw their faith he said you're
[1:12:01] saved
[1:12:03] your faith has saved you you're saved by
[1:12:05] faith
[1:12:07] saved by grace through faith and that
[1:12:08] are yourselves it's a gift of god
[1:12:10] amen and after you realize you're a
[1:12:12] child of god born again
[1:12:13] amen by the spirit of god and if your
[1:12:15] father says there is something back
[1:12:17] there i want you to make right you say
[1:12:18] yes father i'll go make it right because
[1:12:20] i'm your son and i'm born again and amen
[1:12:22] and i'm believing all that you told me
[1:12:29] the devil's played too many games for
[1:12:32] too long
[1:12:33] we've got to come back to this kind of
[1:12:35] belief
[1:12:37] this kind of faith what the lord
[1:12:39] demonstrated
[1:12:42] he said you know you don't see jesus
[1:12:47] getting frustrated with the harlot and
[1:12:50] the drunkard
[1:12:53] do you do you see that in the scriptures
[1:12:55] anywhere do you see him going up to a
[1:12:57] bunch of and said what is wrong with you
[1:12:58] why don't you guys get your life
[1:13:02] together
[1:13:05] what does he do he does what his father
[1:13:08] tells him to do
[1:13:10] and the manifestation of the hour
[1:13:11] attracts the seed of the hour because
[1:13:13] his
[1:13:13] business is to gather the lost sheep
[1:13:18] not to come up with a program that'll
[1:13:20] transform
[1:13:22] bad lives into good lives and reform
[1:13:25] people's attitudes and approaches and
[1:13:27] behaviors
[1:13:28] he's there to seek the lost sheep and
[1:13:29] the only way to find the lost sheep
[1:13:31] is for the manifestation of the word for
[1:13:32] that hour
[1:13:34] the living christ will attract the sheep
[1:13:39] and they'll be saved by faith
[1:13:43] but who does the lord get frustrated
[1:13:45] with
[1:13:46] if he doesn't get frustrated with the
[1:13:48] drunkard and the prostitute and the
[1:13:50] tax collector who does he get frustrated
[1:13:52] with
[1:13:55] listen this may sound odd but he gets
[1:13:58] frustrated with his disciples
[1:14:04] doesn't he
[1:14:07] you know there's a lot of scriptures
[1:14:09] i've got you can pull my notes off and
[1:14:10] go do them but i'm just gonna
[1:14:12] we're just gonna talk because we all
[1:14:13] know the bible
[1:14:15] he looks at peter one day and he starts
[1:14:17] to try
[1:14:18] to get the disciples in the program of
[1:14:21] god
[1:14:22] he says you know i'm going to go to
[1:14:24] jerusalem and the son of man will be
[1:14:25] evenly mistreated and he'll be killed
[1:14:27] rise again on the third day and peter
[1:14:29] says far be it for me he begins to
[1:14:31] rebuke the lord
[1:14:34] he begins to rebuke the lord says the
[1:14:36] lord forbid for me he says get thee
[1:14:38] behind me satan
[1:14:40] now he didn't call the prostitute satan
[1:14:42] or the drunkard satan or the tax
[1:14:43] collector satan
[1:14:47] it was peter because peter was still
[1:14:49] relying on his human thinking he wasn't
[1:14:50] getting with the program of god
[1:14:53] he was not getting in the rhythm of the
[1:14:55] word the word was speaking but
[1:14:57] he was still using his intellect he was
[1:14:58] still using his reasoning
[1:15:00] he was using his human affection and he
[1:15:02] wasn't just getting with the rhythm of
[1:15:03] the word
[1:15:05] he had two disciples when when there was
[1:15:07] a city who refused to receive
[1:15:08] jesus there's two disciples said shall
[1:15:10] we bring fire from heaven down
[1:15:12] and burn them up and he says you don't
[1:15:14] even know what spirit you're of
[1:15:18] because they're not getting with the
[1:15:19] program he says the son of man is not
[1:15:21] has come to save life not to destroy
[1:15:23] life
[1:15:25] see jesus is not worried about what's
[1:15:28] going on
[1:15:28] out there he's worried about the
[1:15:30] children of god coming to the word of
[1:15:32] god and manifesting the life of god
[1:15:35] you don't even know what spirit you're
[1:15:37] of and then he he goes
[1:15:39] to the disciples and he gets in a ship
[1:15:41] and they're they're going from
[1:15:42] one side to the other and a storm comes
[1:15:45] up and
[1:15:45] the the storm beats vehemently on the
[1:15:48] ship and
[1:15:48] now there's no hope that they're going
[1:15:50] to be saved and they wake jesus because
[1:15:52] jesus is asleep in the boat
[1:15:54] and they wake him and says do you not
[1:15:56] care that we die
[1:15:57] and he says oh ye of little faith
[1:16:04] how long must i endure this
[1:16:10] he stands on the bow of the ship and he
[1:16:12] speaks to the storm
[1:16:14] it says peace be still
[1:16:18] he he has peter he comes to peter
[1:16:21] walking on the water one day
[1:16:24] and peter says if lord that you bid me
[1:16:26] come and he says come
[1:16:28] and he starts coming then he begins to
[1:16:29] look around and he begins the fear and
[1:16:31] he begins the doubt
[1:16:34] and he begins to sink he says lord save
[1:16:36] me
[1:16:37] and the lord reached down and picked him
[1:16:38] up and walked him back to the
[1:16:40] ship because he's a son he's not going
[1:16:42] to let him drown he's got work to do
[1:16:45] when he gets him back there he says why
[1:16:47] for did thou doubt o thee of little
[1:16:49] faith
[1:16:52] jesus wasn't frustrated with the
[1:16:56] unbelieving world he was frustrated with
[1:16:58] those who were supposed to believe
[1:17:02] and we're doubting he was frustrated
[1:17:05] with the church that was supposed to
[1:17:07] receive him when they wouldn't receive
[1:17:08] he was frustrated with his own disciples
[1:17:10] who had given the word he had
[1:17:11] demonstrated the sign of the messiah
[1:17:13] he had showed him that he would provide
[1:17:15] he would provide bread and he would
[1:17:17] stop storms and then he could pass
[1:17:19] through crowds and still they get to the
[1:17:20] next trial the next trial they begin to
[1:17:22] cry and fall apart and
[1:17:24] oh don't you care about us won't you
[1:17:25] save us and he says why
[1:17:27] do you have such little faith
[1:17:31] he gets frustrated when a man with an
[1:17:33] epileptic child comes and says lord pray
[1:17:35] for my child i asked your disciples but
[1:17:37] they couldn't cast them out
[1:17:39] because how long will i be with this
[1:17:42] perverse generation
[1:17:44] this unbelieving and perverse generation
[1:17:48] where was jesus frustrated with not the
[1:17:50] ranked center he was frustrated with
[1:17:52] those who were supposed to believe
[1:17:58] and i just want to close by saying i
[1:18:00] don't want to be the kind of disciple
[1:18:03] that he's frustrated with
[1:18:06] i want to believe amen i want to stand
[1:18:08] on the foundation of the world i want to
[1:18:10] believe that what he said he'll do amen
[1:18:12] i want to believe that when if he called
[1:18:13] me i'm his and he'll take care of me
[1:18:15] and then if he says that he'll not lose
[1:18:17] one sheep he's not going to lose this
[1:18:19] sheep amen
[1:18:21] if sickness strikes he won't lose me
[1:18:22] till this purpose with me is done on the
[1:18:24] earth amen if if financial crisis if
[1:18:27] family troubles if church troubles if
[1:18:30] government troubles if whatever troubles
[1:18:32] come
[1:18:32] amen i'm not going to begin to say oh
[1:18:35] god
[1:18:35] amen where are you don't you care that i
[1:18:38] drown don't you care that we die but i
[1:18:40] want to have the kind of faith that says
[1:18:41] god
[1:18:42] i'm watching to see what you're going to
[1:18:44] do because you've got promises that
[1:18:46] won't fail
[1:18:48] i believe you amen i believe you're that
[1:18:50] i am who you said i was and i'm not
[1:18:52] going to change that statement amen
[1:18:54] because i get into trouble or a hard
[1:18:56] time or things go wrong
[1:18:57] but if you said i'm your son i'm your
[1:18:59] son
[1:19:01] if you call me sheep i'm sheep
[1:19:05] and that makes you my shepherd
[1:19:08] and i have a shepherd i shall not want
[1:19:14] see it wasn't
[1:19:17] it wasn't the prostitute on the side of
[1:19:20] the road
[1:19:21] that upset jesus
[1:19:24] it was his own disciple who
[1:19:28] saw the manifestation were close to the
[1:19:31] manifestation the word
[1:19:32] saw the supernatural provision and still
[1:19:37] grumbled complain whined misunderstood
[1:19:44] you know i said we come back to a
[1:19:46] foundation faith
[1:19:48] the foundation of a statue of a perfect
[1:19:50] man
[1:19:51] but i said it's going to take this kind
[1:19:53] of faith every day
[1:19:56] to overcome the obstacles of the day
[1:19:59] i can't give up my sonship because
[1:20:01] everything goes wrong
[1:20:03] i can't doubt the delivering power of
[1:20:05] the lord just because he hesitates to
[1:20:07] deliver for a moment
[1:20:10] i can't doubt i can't start listen
[1:20:14] we're all human beings we're all frail
[1:20:16] we fight the same enemy
[1:20:20] i can't start going down the road of god
[1:20:22] hasn't answered my prayer
[1:20:24] there must be something wrong in my life
[1:20:27] there's something i've done and i don't
[1:20:29] know what i've done but he's mad at me
[1:20:32] now you might not say the word mad at me
[1:20:35] but that's our attitude
[1:20:40] you know i want to be the kind of son
[1:20:42] that says i've got a heavenly father
[1:20:45] and if there's anything hindering the
[1:20:48] word in my life he'll show it to me
[1:20:51] i don't have to guess or be fearful i
[1:20:53] don't have to go back through and comb
[1:20:55] through my memory bank and say
[1:20:56] oh it was the paper clip it was the
[1:21:00] paper clip from work
[1:21:03] that's just human reasoning that's just
[1:21:05] us trying to figure out
[1:21:06] why things aren't working and we have no
[1:21:09] idea things might be working perfect
[1:21:15] when they got in the storm things were
[1:21:16] still working perfect
[1:21:20] you know we don't want to we don't want
[1:21:22] to start off in faith and drop back in
[1:21:24] reasoning
[1:21:26] we don't want to start off believing god
[1:21:27] for everything and fall back to
[1:21:29] well i wonder what's wrong something's
[1:21:31] wrong i've done something wrong
[1:21:34] just say god if i've done something
[1:21:35] wrong show me
[1:21:37] i'm your son i believe you'll show me
[1:21:40] and if you show me give me the strength
[1:21:42] to make it right
[1:21:44] but until then i'm going to believe your
[1:21:46] word
[1:21:47] you're going to heal me you're going to
[1:21:49] deliver me you're going to bring me
[1:21:50] through this
[1:21:51] you're going to bring me through the
[1:21:52] valley of the shadow of death because
[1:21:53] you are my shepherd and you have not
[1:21:54] left me
[1:21:56] because the word says you won't leave me
[1:22:00] it doesn't matter what i feel the word
[1:22:02] says you won't leave me
[1:22:04] it doesn't matter how i feel but the
[1:22:06] word says you're my good shepherd
[1:22:07] the word says that i'm in your hand the
[1:22:09] word says no man shall pluck me out of
[1:22:12] your hand
[1:22:12] i'm not even able to pluck myself out of
[1:22:14] your hand
[1:22:16] i'm going to stick with the word
[1:22:20] i want to i want to get to a place
[1:22:25] where i can have that kind of simple
[1:22:27] faith
[1:22:29] that the woman who washed his feet had
[1:22:32] i mean i doubt she didn't have it all
[1:22:35] thought out
[1:22:36] she didn't even bring a towel
[1:22:40] right blind bartimaeus didn't have time
[1:22:42] to think it all
[1:22:43] out he just acted by inspiration and
[1:22:46] faith
[1:22:48] the woman at the well she didn't have
[1:22:50] time to plan what's going to happen if i
[1:22:52] meet somebody who answered my questions
[1:22:53] today
[1:22:55] but there's something in here that can
[1:22:56] respond by faith to the situation
[1:22:59] and i want to live by faith in who i am
[1:23:01] and who he is
[1:23:02] and that who this who the word is and
[1:23:04] what day we live in and what hour this
[1:23:06] is and what my position is in christ
[1:23:08] i'm seated in christ in heavenly places
[1:23:10] how is he not going to take care of me
[1:23:12] he's in me and i'm in him how is he not
[1:23:14] going to provide for me
[1:23:16] how will i go hungry how will he not
[1:23:17] heal this body how will he not provide
[1:23:19] for
[1:23:20] every need he's in me and i'm in him i'm
[1:23:22] seated now in heavenly places i'm part
[1:23:24] of his bride
[1:23:25] how will he not take care of me
[1:23:29] and if i need corrected he'll correct me
[1:23:32] amen but i don't have to correct myself
[1:23:34] and i don't have to imagine things that
[1:23:36] are wrong i just
[1:23:37] trust in him and walk forward and keep
[1:23:38] believing that he'll provide everything
[1:23:40] and that he'll move every mountain and
[1:23:42] apart every sea
[1:23:46] because he's my heavenly father he's my
[1:23:49] husband
[1:23:50] he's the word made manifest today and i
[1:23:52] believe him
[1:23:54] i want to have the simple faith of
[1:23:56] zacchaeus
[1:23:58] the simple faith of the woman that
[1:23:59] washed his feet the simple faith of the
[1:24:01] woman at the well
[1:24:02] the simple faith of blind bartimaeus i
[1:24:04] want to have that kind of faith
[1:24:07] and i want to have it every day
[1:24:12] i want to build on the foundation and i
[1:24:14] want to grow into the head
[1:24:16] into christ i want to grow into the
[1:24:19] stature of a perfect man
[1:24:21] but you always listen no matter how high
[1:24:24] you grow
[1:24:26] in the statue of a perfect man you're
[1:24:28] still on the foundation of faith
[1:24:32] no matter how far you go
[1:24:35] you're always on the foundation of faith
[1:24:38] everything is based on faith
[1:24:42] and that not of yourselves it is a gift
[1:24:45] of god
[1:24:48] if you have the capacity to believe this
[1:24:50] word not from your head but from your
[1:24:51] heart
[1:24:54] then you should be able to trust god
[1:25:02] let's go to john chapter 10.
[1:25:07] i want to read two more scriptures and
[1:25:08] then we're going to close
[1:25:14] john chapter 10 verse 27

[1:25:24] and i know them and they follow me
[1:25:29] listen if that doesn't make your heart
[1:25:31] swell right now
[1:25:32] i don't know what will
[1:25:36] i was his sheep before before what
[1:25:39] before i was born
[1:25:42] he found me i didn't find him he the one
[1:25:46] who
[1:25:46] he come he come searching me out
[1:25:50] saying chad chad where are you
[1:25:54] chad chad where are you
[1:25:58] he knows me
[1:26:01] and i follow him it's already
[1:26:05] programmed into the plan i'm going this
[1:26:07] is the nature of sheep and shepherds
[1:26:10] 28 and i give unto thee eternal life
[1:26:13] and they shall never perish neither
[1:26:16] shall
[1:26:17] any man pluck them out of my hand my
[1:26:19] father which gave to me is greater than
[1:26:21] all and no man is able to pluck them out
[1:26:24] of my father's hand
[1:26:25] i and my father are one
[1:26:30] if you're his sheep he knows you
[1:26:34] and you follow him and no man
[1:26:38] can pluck you out of his hand and no man
[1:26:41] can pluck you out of his father's hand
[1:26:43] and his father is greater than all and
[1:26:44] he and his father are one
[1:26:48] let's go to luke 15. musicians if you'd
[1:26:52] like to come
[1:26:52] brother ben if you make your way up
[1:26:54] please luke 15.
[1:27:01] verse 4.
[1:27:05] luke 15 verse 4 what man of you having a
[1:27:09] hundred sheep
[1:27:10] if you lose one of them does not leave
[1:27:13] the ninety and nine in the wilderness
[1:27:15] and go after that which is lost until
[1:27:19] he find it
[1:27:25] he searches until he finds it
[1:27:30] it was already his sheep he's not
[1:27:32] looking for new sheep
[1:27:34] god in this day christ is not looking
[1:27:37] for new sheep
[1:27:38] he's only looking for his sheep
[1:27:41] but he'll leave the 99 and go after the
[1:27:43] one and he will
[1:27:44] search until he finds it
[1:27:49] he won't lose one listen
[1:27:54] we have a heavenly father we are sheep
[1:27:58] of his pasture
[1:27:59] he gave us something to believe with
[1:28:02] let's have confidence in that
[1:28:05] tell the devil to leave
[1:28:08] he says to resist the devil and he shall
[1:28:10] flee when he comes with all the doubts
[1:28:12] and questions and
[1:28:14] starts questioning your foundation and
[1:28:16] whether you've done right or why things
[1:28:17] aren't working out for you
[1:28:19] just go back to the simplicity of saying
[1:28:22] but i know this is him and i know i
[1:28:24] belong to him
[1:28:26] hallelujah don't frustrate him by
[1:28:29] how many times has he delivered you how
[1:28:31] many times has he provided for you how
[1:28:33] many times has he fed you
[1:28:35] how many times have we come service
[1:28:37] after service needing something from god
[1:28:39] and god gives it
[1:28:41] how many times have we needed god to
[1:28:43] answer a prayer we had
[1:28:44] no solution to the problem and we just
[1:28:46] waited and waited and all of a sudden
[1:28:48] solution came
[1:28:49] without effort sometimes without
[1:28:51] planning it come from outside of our
[1:28:52] scope of imagination but god just
[1:28:54] resolved the issue that was in front of
[1:28:56] us
[1:28:56] without our efforts how many times has
[1:28:58] he done that
[1:29:00] so the next time you get in the boat and
[1:29:01] the waves are beating don't be like the
[1:29:03] disciples don't make him say
[1:29:05] why how long do i have to bear with you
[1:29:08] or you little faith
[1:29:09] but let's grow up into mature christians
[1:29:11] and say lord you've done it before and
[1:29:13] you'll do it again amen
[1:29:14] nothing has changed between me and you i
[1:29:17] still believe you for who you are and
[1:29:19] i'm still your sheep amen and if you
[1:29:21] did it before you'll do it again
[1:29:25] amen i don't want to be like the
[1:29:28] disciples he was frustrated with i don't
[1:29:30] wanna
[1:29:30] i don't wanna let reasoning and fears
[1:29:32] and anxieties
[1:29:33] amen take away the truth that i hold in
[1:29:35] my heart that he is my god and he is my
[1:29:38] shepherd and he is able
[1:29:39] and though i walk through the valley of
[1:29:41] the shadow of death he'll not leave
[1:29:42] me thou art with me
[1:29:46] we've got to grow up and start acting
[1:29:48] like adults at some point amen we start
[1:29:50] have to start acting like a mature bride
[1:29:52] of jesus christ and quit
[1:29:54] being children
[1:29:57] you got to come to a place where our
[1:29:59] whole world is falling apart
[1:30:01] when everything it seems like is going
[1:30:04] wrong amen
[1:30:05] we've got to get to the place where we
[1:30:06] say but all is well
[1:30:11] all is well you know the the woman who
[1:30:15] made the little room for
[1:30:16] elijah and she gave him a child and that
[1:30:19] child died
[1:30:21] she goes writing to elijah she has a
[1:30:23] dead baby
[1:30:26] a dead baby when she gets to elijah says
[1:30:30] is all well
[1:30:31] she says all is well
[1:30:34] listen elijah was the manifestation of
[1:30:37] the word for that day
[1:30:39] and when she came to the living word for
[1:30:40] her day she knew
[1:30:42] all as well and i want to have that kind
[1:30:46] of faith that no matter what's going
[1:30:47] wrong i want in my heart to say all is
[1:30:49] well
[1:30:50] and my mind is screaming a million
[1:30:52] reasons to protest
[1:30:53] i want to shut the mind down and say all
[1:30:56] is well
[1:30:57] amen this may be a valley of the shadow
[1:30:59] of death but it only proves that he's
[1:31:00] with me
[1:31:03] the scripture's still true amen my
[1:31:05] position is still true
[1:31:06] amen my sonship is still secure amen his
[1:31:09] love for me is still in place
[1:31:11] nothing has changed everything is still
[1:31:13] as it was
[1:31:15] i'm not going to let this circumstance
[1:31:17] rob me of faith i'm not going to let the
[1:31:18] circumstance rob me
[1:31:19] of my security amen my security comes
[1:31:22] from the word
[1:31:25] let's all stand i tell you
[1:31:31] this is a simple message as simple as
[1:31:33] simple a message you can get
[1:31:35] but it's one that if we could catch and
[1:31:37] live it'll change every day
[1:31:41] no more running around amen no more
[1:31:43] ringing hands no more
[1:31:45] amen losing our minds in every difficult
[1:31:48] situation
[1:31:49] no more speaking such horrible things
[1:31:53] when things are going wrong
[1:31:56] there's so many times i've had to repent
[1:31:58] for the words that come out of my mouth
[1:32:00] in the trial
[1:32:02] i mean words like don't you care don't
[1:32:05] you see
[1:32:07] i'm probably not the only one who's
[1:32:08] cried that out midnight one o'clock in
[1:32:10] the morning
[1:32:12] god don't you see don't you care don't
[1:32:14] you know
[1:32:16] but i don't want to be like that anymore
[1:32:18] i want to say god i know you see and i
[1:32:20] know you care and i know you're watching
[1:32:22] over me
[1:32:23] and give me the strength to pass through
[1:32:24] this trial because i know
[1:32:26] when i'm tried i shall come forth as
[1:32:28] gold
[1:32:29] i know this is for good i know this is
[1:32:31] for my benefit i know this is for your
[1:32:33] glory lord
[1:32:34] because you made these promises to me
[1:32:36] and they're still true
[1:32:39] it's a simple message but oh it's not
[1:32:41] simple
[1:32:43] it's profound if we could live this way
[1:32:46] every day
[1:32:47] then you'll see the greater works then
[1:32:50] you'll see mountains move then you'll
[1:32:52] see things change
[1:32:54] no more whining no more complaining
[1:32:58] but just a quiet confidence a steadiness
[1:33:02] that says god is still on the throne
[1:33:05] i'm still a sheep and he's still my
[1:33:07] shepherd
[1:33:09] and though it looks bad all
[1:33:12] is well all is well
[1:33:16] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:33:20] your heavenly father
[1:33:23] lord i don't always understand why
[1:33:27] why you have us preach certain things at
[1:33:30] certain times but i know it's you lord
[1:33:33] and i know it's meeting a need right now
[1:33:37] and wherever that need is lord i pray
[1:33:39] that you'd come and pour
[1:33:40] supernatural divine oil bring a healing
[1:33:44] and a confidence and a security
[1:33:47] to those who need it lord
[1:33:50] forgive us father forgive us for our
[1:33:53] little faith
[1:33:55] forgive us lord for constantly coming
[1:33:59] back
[1:33:59] and whining and doubting and questioning
[1:34:02] but god help us to grow into mature
[1:34:04] believers lord
[1:34:05] wash all the unbelief away lord move
[1:34:07] away all doubt and all insecurity lord
[1:34:10] and let us live lord on the bedrock of
[1:34:12] foundation
[1:34:13] foundation of faith lord believing you
[1:34:17] trusting you recognizing you
[1:34:20] oh god we love you lord and we thank you
[1:34:23] for the day you've called us in
[1:34:25] it may be troublesome on every side but
[1:34:27] it's a good day
[1:34:29] prophets and wise men have longed to see
[1:34:31] this day and have it but we get to see
[1:34:33] it lord
[1:34:34] and it may be troubling to the flesh and
[1:34:36] it may be difficult
[1:34:37] amen on the emotional realm but all they
[1:34:40] would have longed to be here if they
[1:34:42] could
[1:34:43] but you've allowed us to be here help us
[1:34:45] not waste our opportunity lord for we
[1:34:47] only get one opportunity in this life
[1:34:49] let us not waste it and squander it with
[1:34:52] feebleness and
[1:34:53] weakness lord and in our soul but help
[1:34:56] us to have confidence and steadfastness
[1:34:59] and security in your word help us lord
[1:35:02] to
[1:35:02] stand fast and watch you work
[1:35:06] help us to take all of our confidence
[1:35:07] off of ourselves
[1:35:09] and put it on you
[1:35:12] lord if we could just transfer all the
[1:35:16] responsibility and all of
[1:35:18] the pressure and we could just lay it on
[1:35:19] your shoulders where it belongs
[1:35:22] and just let you care for us lord if we
[1:35:26] could just have
[1:35:26] peace in the midst of the trial if we
[1:35:28] just have peace in the midst of the
[1:35:30] storm knowing that
[1:35:31] you got everything in control lord it
[1:35:34] would be a testimony to all around us
[1:35:38] help us father forgive us
[1:35:41] increase our faith oh lord move away
[1:35:44] every doubt forgive us of our unbelief
[1:35:46] help us with our own belief
[1:35:48] but help what's in the soul to come out
[1:35:51] move the reasoning away and the doubts
[1:35:53] in the mind and the questions about move
[1:35:55] it away lord
[1:35:57] let your light penetrate through all of
[1:35:58] that and your word may bring a greater
[1:36:01] manifestation of what's already inside
[1:36:03] of us lord
[1:36:04] we yield ourselves to you lord we commit
[1:36:07] ourselves to you afresh
[1:36:09] have your way with us in jesus christ's
[1:36:12] name
[1:36:13] amen i just want to say
[1:36:18] just give an observation and take it for
[1:36:20] what it's worth because my observation
[1:36:21] may be wrong
[1:36:24] but sometimes when we begin to
[1:36:28] question based off the circumstances our
[1:36:32] ability to overcome the trial
[1:36:34] whatever's going on you just name it you
[1:36:36] just pick your trial
[1:36:38] and we begin to doubt whether we'll get
[1:36:40] through it past it around it or we can
[1:36:43] overcome or we'll be overcome by it or
[1:36:45] when we start to have all this turmoil
[1:36:48] it's a clear indication that we're
[1:36:50] operating out of flesh rounds
[1:36:53] and that we're actually putting our
[1:36:55] confidence in our ability to overcome
[1:37:00] and it's a good indicator when you start
[1:37:02] to see that when you really say i don't
[1:37:04] know how we're going to get through i
[1:37:05] don't know how i'm gonna do
[1:37:06] this i i don't see any way possible i
[1:37:08] just don't know what i'm gonna do i
[1:37:09] can't
[1:37:09] overcome this when you start to talk
[1:37:11] like this you've you've put your
[1:37:13] confidence in yourself
[1:37:18] and i say that's the time to say oh god
[1:37:20] forgive me
[1:37:21] it's all in you you bought me
[1:37:25] i'm not my own i belong to you you
[1:37:28] purchased me with your own blood
[1:37:29] i am your child i am your bride i am
[1:37:31] your wife you chose me you selected me
[1:37:33] you
[1:37:34] called me you told me to come unto you
[1:37:37] i've done what you said and now i
[1:37:39] realize i can't overcome
[1:37:40] i can't fix this amen but you can
[1:37:44] and you will i don't know how you will i
[1:37:47] don't know how you'll make it all work
[1:37:48] out but i believe you will
[1:37:52] we sometimes we express where we are
[1:37:55] by the things we're worried about in our
[1:37:57] attitudes
[1:37:59] we need to check ourselves sometimes and
[1:38:01] say am i depending on me to get through
[1:38:03] this
[1:38:04] or am i trusting in him we need to go
[1:38:07] back to trusting in him
[1:38:10] and then quiet down little bride settle
[1:38:13] down
