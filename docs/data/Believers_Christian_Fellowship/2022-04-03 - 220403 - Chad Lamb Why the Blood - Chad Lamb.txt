our hearts lord as we worship you as we feed upon your word lord we thank you father for this privilege in jesus christ's name we pray amen man god bless you this morning it's good to be together if we could turn in our bibles to acts chapter 20 we'll begin in acts chapter 20. i also want to welcome a couple of visitors we've got a brother paul hartland and his wife are here from new brunswick and so i got to meet him yesterday and shake his hand and spend a few minutes with him he drove three days to be here with us so i don't think any of us are more prepared than that brother and his wife for the service this morning so god bless you and it's good to have brother carlson sampson and his wife back with us again they were here a couple weeks ago we got to see them so we appreciate them coming down from ontario and then also sister elaine moulton sister carolyn colai's mom is here she was here wednesday god bless you it's good to have you here so i don't know if you've noticed but the canadians have moved down i don't know if we should be nervous i don't know what to expect next but a lot of canadians are converging in limo ohio but praise god it's getting easier to travel now the borders are getting easier to cross and we thank god that we can enjoy this fellowship together amen let's look at acts chapter 20. also i want to remind you there is communion service this afternoon so we'll gather again for communion and feet washing and also we'll have the vote of confidence for the trustees and sunday school superintendents but i'd like to do that right at the beginning before we start the song service so if you can make sure you're back early for the service and we'll do that right away and then go into the song service this afternoon all right acts chapter 20 verse 28. take heed therefore unto yourselves into all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood and god bless you as you take your seats amen may god bless us as we look into his word i wanted to take for a subject this morning why the blood and it's interesting because it's such a major theme in christianity as the blood it's a theme that runs from genesis to revelation and i was just meditating on it i don't even know why well i know why because god does everything and he leads us but i was just meditating and i'm just meditating on that question why the blood and i felt like i knew the answer but i really wanted to dive in and take a look at it because when we see there's there's there's fundamental things to christianity that all christians talk about all denominations everybody will begin talking about the blood the blood of jesus the blood of the sacrifice amen but i found that the denominational understanding and all these things is is weak at best and not not really fully developed with the understanding god wants us to have but also all these things that are basics i would say amen there they're absolutely wonderful truths when we go to look at them and don't take them for granted amen so many things become phrases or cliches or subjects that we take for granted or we feel like we understand but when we really go to look at it and the light of the message that's been given to us in this day these things that we thought were so basic they explode into depths that we can't even reach i mean we can't even fathom the depths of this and so i just wanted to take the service this morning and maybe in the way of a sunday school lesson so keep your bibles handy we'll we'll just go through a lot of scriptures this morning but i want to talk about why the blood and it says here in acts chapter 20 verse 28 to told them to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood whose blood god's blood that's what acts 20 28 tells us feed the flock of god which he hath purchased with his own blood so we know that the blood was a purchasing price for the church of god amen so praise be to god we have been purchased with blood with god's blood i'd say that's pretty valuable i'd say that makes us worth something amen at least we're something to god let's go to hebrews chapter 9. hebrews chapter 9. and we'll read just one verse verse 22 hebrews 9 and 22 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission so this is a principle that that comes all the way through the scripture that all things almost all things are by the law purged with blood purge means purified or cleansed and without the shedding of blood is no remission so we see this and brother bam tells us in the message fellowship you cannot have fellowship with god without coming to god's agreement and there is a basic thing for fellowship and that's the blood the blood only it's been god's way from the beginning and it will be till the end the only place of fellowship is through the blood so we know that and i think we could say that in any any church in the world any denominational church anywhere and they would say amen to that but what the message has done is taken us deeper into that amen so that we can understand how to fellowship under the blood what does it mean to have the blood applied amen what is the the what what is this not a cliche not a phrase not not something that you know we were taught to repeat in sunday school but what is the real depth of this understanding about the blood it was from the beginning it's been god's way from the beginning and god has never changed his mind about that so the only place of fellowship is through the blood go to revelation 13. revelation chapter 13 revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so we have in in the mind of god we have a lamb slain from the foundation of the world and that that lamb would be jesus christ when he was made in flesh and that flesh would be the word made flesh in that that flesh would die and the blood would be shed and we know that it was the blood of god it was created blood and but from the beginning from the foundation of the world amen the lamb was slain so this has been god's plan from the beginning and it's been god's plan throughout and god has never changed his mind amen so i think this is a a very important subject let's go to leviticus leviticus chapter 17 if we could we're going from one end to the other god bless you this is like sword drills in sunday school class i won't make you stand up when you find it uh the kids would beat us all because they're still doing it in sunday school class all right leviticus chapter 17 and verse 10. leviticus 17 and 10. and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the strangers that so join among you that eateth any manner of blood i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i've given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for your souls so now god is now speaking here in leviticus that you're not the mankind is not to eat the blood because the life is in the blood and he said it's the blood that made an atonement upon the altar for your souls and atonement means a covering here so i'm made of covering for you to cover your sin uh to cover your souls amen by this blood because the life is in the blood so we find out this subject of blood has to do with life amen it's actually a subject that has to do with life and it has to do with death it has to do with redemption a fallen a redemption and so he says the life of the flesh is in the blood i will give it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that so joineth among you eat blood and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel of the stranger that sojourn among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust for it is the life of all flesh and the blood of his blood of it is for the life thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel you shall eat you shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off so god is establishing a major truth for us that the life of all flesh is the blood thereof and that blood is given upon the altars and atonement so we know that life is a sacred thing to god all life is sacred to god and the blood that represents the life where it is the the life of all flesh is in the blood and so god would god would not allow man to eat of that blood but the blood must go back into the ground amen and not to be eaten or upon the altar to be a covering for mankind so god is is showing us that life is a precious thing that the blood represents the life and the blood is to be held sacred or precious because it's an atonement for our souls now the prophet of god says jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever therefore when when god made a remedy for man to be saved in the garden of eden they tried to improve his remedy through six thousand years and can never touch it he made upon the basis of the shed blood of an innocent victim and he's never changed it we've tried to educate people to christ we've tried to denominate them to christ we've tried all kinds of systems but they've all failed there's only one place that men can meet on a common ground and of worship and that is under the shed blood of jesus christ it's been that way from the beginning because he cannot change it it's always the blood the blood amen you know really i i remember as a boy growing up in uh denominational churches and i remember these concepts and it's hard to go back and remember what you thought back then in detail because you change as time goes on and your understanding and revelation changes but i remember as a boy hearing about the blood all of my life and the blood of jesus christ and the blood of bulls and goats and then the blood of jesus christ and redemption by blood and cleansed by the blood and all of these things but i realized growing up that they were just terminologies amen and i knew somehow they meant salvation i knew somehow they meant salvation and that jesus died for me and i understood that concept but but there's a concept with the blood and with the life amen that goes deeper than that let's go to genesis chapter 3. it took a prophet of god in this age to come and pull these things out so that the bible is not things that that that we are constantly shrugging our shoulders about i don't know why but i don't know why this i don't know i just i don't know but god he wanted to unveil himself to his children so that we weren't always going i don't know i don't know i don't know but he would say no there's been a prophet of god who showed us in the word what that what god wants to reveal himself to his children god wants to be known god wants us to understand what he's done for us he wants us to know this earth is part of our education so that we can know god and know about god in a way we could have never comprehended in perfection so god allowed certain things to transpire he did not make them transpire but he allowed them to transpire that would drop us down into a negative so that the negative would help us to understand the positives and so this this is our schooling this is our education and there's things that he's done and he wants us to understand why so let's look at genesis chapter 3 verse 21. unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them we see here this is after the fall and god comes down to judge his children and judge the earth or curse the earth and judge the serpent and when he's doing this now he has to make an atonement for them and the atonement or the covering that he's going to make for them is he's going to use the skins of animals well the only way to get the skins of animals is to slay the animal so this is the first time in the account that we have in scripture this is the first account of death or shedding of blood and the first account we have of shedding of blood is is the blood jesus that god himself as a father coming down into the garden amen to cover his law his fallen children he slays an animal an innocent animal he slays and he puts the skins over them to cover their nakedness because now the veil of innocency has been removed and they're under a veil of lust and now can see each other as naked so god makes an atonement or a covering for them and he sheds the blood of an innocent victim amen to make an atonement for them what's he doing he is showing his redemption story already here in the very beginning of the book of genesis he's showing what is it going to take amen to cover what is it going to take to redeem to restore fellowship it's going to take the shed blood of an innocent victim it was god's plan from the beginning and this plan amen runs all the way through the bible because jesus christ was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so so now we begin to see this story unfold that god himself slayed the lamb and clothed his fallen children and he did that to preserve them in some way so that his his uh work can continue on until he can complete it and the message i will restore from 1955 brother iran says notice now that's the same kind of revelation that abel got because it was revealed to him that it wasn't apples that brought us out of the garden like people think here today but it was blood life mortal life and it was revealed by god and god received this man abel and condemned cain so we realize now that cain he also will shed blood let's look at this in chapter four chapter 4 verse 1 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from from the lord and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep so what was abel a keeper of sheep sheep lambs he's a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the first things of his flock the first things of his flock was what a lamb he brought a lamb first things of his flock and the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel into his offering but until came into his offering he had no respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell we we have the this the first form of worship that we see from fallen man going to offer worship to god and they go to make a sacrifice and cain offers the fruits of the field his labor his works and and it is so interesting that that program continues on today because we have people who think that my oh they think that my bad deeds separated me from god so in order to make a recompense for bad deeds i have to do good deeds and good deeds will equal my salvation that's why it's easy for a church to have a works program that it was my bad deeds that separated me from god and so now if i if i do enough good deeds and i serve the church and i serve god and i do all the right things that i can be brought back into fellowship of god and be saved that's cain's religion but abel's religion was based on revelation and he knew abel knew it was not his bad deeds that got him out of the garden and there's no amount of good deeds that could get him back into the garden amen it wasn't there was something else that took place that caused him for the fellowship to be broken that caused him to be separated from god and so there was no way and there was an impossibility for abel to work his way back into fellowship and good standing with god there was no way for him to redeem himself amen by revelation god gave him a revelation of why he was outside of the garden and why he needed to bring a sacrifice and why he had to wear the skins of animals and that revelation that he had explained his condition i'm so glad that god gave us a revelation his hour that will explain our condition amen so that we won't be tossed about by all these wins and doctrines and systems of men and programs and remember we'll come back to the reality amen of why we must have an atonement to begin with so he brought a lamb the firstlings of his flock he was a keeper of sheep so he brought a lamb and brother bam says in the mark of the beast and the seal of god from 1961 he says but now but how there was no bible in that day so it must have been revealed to abel hebrews 11 said by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain testifying of him that he was righteous now cain said i guess my mother eats some apples and she had to put on clothes and abel knew that it was blood life there had been something happened wrong and he offered the blood of a lamb he didn't just abel wasn't cruel he wasn't vicious he wasn't he didn't desire the destruction of other life but he realized where the destruction of his life came and he saw what god did to make an atonement for his children and by revelation he knew that it would take a substitute life to cover for his wrong life and that substitute life was a lamb and he shed the blood of the lamb and god had respect unto his sacrifice but not unto cain's in the message wisdom versus faith prophet says see by wisdom cain offered you know not knowing the word but just thought by wisdom he made a nice place and made it pretty and beautiful but abel no one told him now just a boy by faith saw that it wasn't botany life it was a sexual affair through blood there you are brother weighed over the top of that one time by faith his children still sees it do you see it that takes this whole subject of blood that's through the bible and it begins to take it way deeper this message takes what everybody else talks about and gives lip service to this message takes and gets to the heart of it why what god is accomplishing what happened what went wrong and how is he making it right it goes beyond the terminology it goes to the thought of god it was a sexual affair through blood there you are brother wade over the top of that one time by faith his children still sees it he never taught it by some wisdom now it don't come by wisdom it comes by faith the bible said abel by faith what did he offer blood from a living life animal life we're animal or ourselves where warm warm-blooded animal that's exactly right higher species the highest animal but with the soul in there that's what's life now notice by faith abel saw the revelation the vision and brought a living running blood because life was in the blood life is the the stem life in the stem of the flower it's botany life which has no feeling i was i was hoping that would soak in able by faith staying with the word by faith not by wisdom by faith he seen that it was sex blood the blood cell comes from the male the male has the blood cell and the sperm and the hemoglobin is the blood comes through the male and adam know that it wasn't apples and peaches and potatoes or whatever it was that brought them out of the garden of eden that caused the sin it was sex blood and he offered blood back so now the revelation that abel had become super clear by able sacrifice and the lack of a revelation that cain had becomes evident by cain's sacrifice and i want to follow this through this bible study this morning because we're going to find that we're standing in the same place today nothing is any different whatsoever we're standing just like they were standing in that day amen in our worship will indicate what our revelation is that's what was happening in that day he realized abel realized what went wrong in the garden and it had something to do with life with this mortal life amen it was it was done by sex and it affected the life and now he found himself in a fallen wrong condition but he was going to offer life blood back to cover for his life and we know that that was only a substitute only a covering it could never remove amen but it was god's plan it was foreshadowing that there was another lamb coming amen there was a perfect lamb coming that could bring a perfect atonement again in wisdom versus faith he says not me i ain't the word he's the word if i was the word then there's only one person would be the word and he was jesus he was god's spoken word by a virgin birth i i'm a perversion see i'm the result of a union between my father and mother this has to die that's me see the body that has to die wasn't so with jesus he was the word he was born virgin brother there's no woman man or nothing else had nothing to do with him the woman was the incubator that's right and he nursed her breast and so forth that might have been true about that but let me tell you he was god that's who he was wasn't no sex about it at all he had to be free from sex to bring forth life through the blood as we'll get to in a few minutes then look he was the word but but the word of the lord now let's turn to psalms 51. i want to look at something here in psalms that i found to be very interesting psalms 51 in verse 5. it's a psalm of david in psalm 51 and then this one verse verse 5. behold i was shaping an iniquity and in sin and my mother conceived me now this is david and we have no knowledge in the bible that david was illegitimately born no there's no adultery involved no fornication but david would say that i was shaping an iniquity and sin did my mother conceive me there's david said there's something wrong with my birth the way that i came is based on sin amen now we know that god he allowed it he said now if that's the way you're going to do it go on and do it he he permitted us to bring forth children amen through the way we bring forth children in this day he permitted it but brother ben said it's not his perfect will it's his permissive will so now we're operating in his permissive will and in his permissive will because god has made allowance for it why did god make allowance for it because it keeps his program moving it's part of his master plan and because he makes allowance for it you can be considered righteous right because god made it's his permissive will he permitted it and ordained it and he considers if you stay within the confines of marriage you can still be considered clean and holy and righteous but still what we have today is not god's original plan it's still wrong and it's still based on iniquity and sin and david could say although he was born from his mother and his father and a marriage relationship with no adultery and no fornication because i was shaping in iniquity and then sin and then sin did my mother conceive me that's why those things won't be in the next life when everything's made right and so we can see now that that brother branham's saying i'm a perversion because i'm a mixture of my mother and father perverted where back when man fell from god's word and since then god permitted it part of his permissive will you could remain righteous and holy in that channel because god made it his permissive will but it's not his perfect will and so now because of that we are everyone born wrong that's why jesus christ had to be virgin born and and what does it have to do with blood why does it have to be virgin born blood why because the life is the life is in the blood what happened in the beginning the blood what what was the problem blood what was offered as a substitute blood amen what is going to be the atonement blood why it all goes back to the fall in the beginning it all goes back to eden if we don't know what happened in eden then we don't even understand the bible that we're holding in our hands claiming to serve god and believe god but we don't even know why did jesus christ shed his blood for us if we don't know serpent seed we don't know about the fall we don't know why he was virgin born we don't know why he had to have a pure blood we don't know we don't know the gospel without knowing the beginning so we have billions of people preaching the gospel what they're preaching amen is a similitude of the gospel all right let's say they're preaching terminologies from the gospel and those terminologies are being preached but the gospel is based off the realization amen that there was something that went wrong in the beginning amen and it was blood it was sex it was a perversion it was contrary to the will and word of god amen and now we're stuck into this trap because we've come forth by a union of a man and a woman in god's permissive will but we've come forth wrong and there's got to be something that'll make us right that's the heart of the gospel how can you have the gospel without serpentine without the doctrine of serpency see that's why when these truths were revealed to us it wasn't you know another talking point or something that would make us better than the baptist it was so that we would have the gospel it wasn't so that i know a little bit more than this one and we've got you know a little better doctor a little clearer understanding no it is so we would have understanding period not just a better understanding but that we would know that this bible that i hold in my hands it makes sense to me there's a purpose in it all there's a plan throughout it's all working together in continuity and god never changed his mind it's been his plan all the way through in spoken word is the original seed he says then except a man be born again why must he be born again he's dead the flesh he's in he's a hybrid he's got to be born again why he was born in sin from eve sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies again in spoken word he says man wasn't made to die he was made to live but high breeding brought death it brought life a death there rather she hybrid it now you deny the serpent seed then i'll ask you why what's these funeral services about she was hybrid every one of us are hybrid from the original that's the reason you're constantly dying praise be to god let's go to exodus chapter 12. i want to keep looking at this through the bible and just kind of move through the bible if we can exodus chapter 12. friends i don't know but something about this message keeps making my heart soar higher and higher it unlocked the bible in exodus chapter 12 13. we're coming to the passover we've had plagues that are striking egypt under the ministry of moses and moses is going to be the deliverer that god will use to bring them out with a mighty ham and the last thing that will strike amen will strike uh in the in the uh and the passover the death angel will come to smite all the firstborn but god has made a way of salvation for his people and we pick it up in verse 13 we'll just read one verse and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt there was a a plague coming there was a death angel passing there was death that was going to strike the land of egypt but god was going to make an atonement for his children and the only atonement that he could make was blood because it's been god's plan from the beginning it was his plan in eden it was the plan outside of eaton when abel offered his lamb it was the plan of redemption here in egypt god was redeeming his children and the last thing he does is tell them to take a lamb a lamb for a household and take that lamb and slay it and take the blood of the lamb and put it upon the the doorpost and the lentils of the door amen so that there was a he said the blood shall be for a token and that token means it's a representation that the life of an innocent one was spilt for the this household and so the token was the blood and it stood as a representation that there was a substitute there was a life given because the life the blood is the life amen the blood the life is in the blood and when he saw the blood he knew that there was a life given in exchange for the lives in that home because this has been god's plan from the beginning why because the problem is blood [Music] so he said when i see the blood the blood shall be a token upon the house in the token message from 1964 brother says now israel's slain lamb was the requirement of jehovah and the blood was the token that the job had been done god required for redemption from egypt to go to the promised land he required a slain a slain animal and that animal must the blood of the dead animal must be put upon the lentil and the door and that stood for the token that the thing that jehovah had required had been fulfilled now not the lamb was the token the blood was the token now the life had gone out from the sacrifice and now the blood was the token his orders had been carried out the blood stood for the token the sign that this believer had done exactly what the requirement was that was the token all right seeing the believer worship was then identified with his sacrifice so the way that he worshipped was what how did he worship he worshipped the way that the prophet told him god wanted him to worship he took the lamb slain the blood applied it amen and when you could see uh when you could see worship i just want to say it this way you can see worship it shows on the outside amen they could see they could see the worship of that family on the doorpost in the lentils your worship is showing he said he said that was a token all right seeing the believer worship was then identified with his sacrifice so his worship was showing what he was feeding on in the house because the life was slain of the lamb and the blood was put as a token on the outside but they were inside the house eating the very lamb whose life was a token life blood was a token on the outside so the worship on the outside showed what they were feeding on on the inside they were feeding on this lamb and the lamb's life token was on the door and everything was in continuity the inside and the outside the worship was pure amen and then they were told to eat all the lamb even the pertinence thereof they're supposed to eat the tasty morsels and the not so tasty morsels because christ is our lamb amen and there's been a token provided for us to put on the outside of the house amen but but we're supposed to be in our house feeding on the lamb which is the word of god amen the the word was made flesh and so now we're supposed to be feeding on the word and that word amen we're supposed to feed on all of the word in our house the the with the pertinence thereof the tasty morsels the tender juicy pieces and the tough difficult pieces to digest we're supposed to eat it all and we in the house eating with the with the token of the life of the sacrifice showing on the outside nothing's changed god's bible runs in perfect continuity he goes on in the token and say here is the house and the worshiper what was the requirement slay a lamb on the 14th day after it was put up a male without blemish all israel shall slay it and the blood shall be a token with hyssop and put it upon the lentil of the door and by the way i want you to pay close attention to what he's going to say next by the way that his hop was just common weeds now we're going to talk about the application of the blood the hyssop was just common weeds hyssop means your faith somebody tries to have supernatural faith that's the reason you miss your healing faith is just common thing you got faith to come to church you got faith to walk out there you got faith to start your car you got faith to eat your dinner that's the way it is just common faith now apply the blood was applied with hyssop which is just common weeds that grows anywhere in palestine showing that the faith that the blood is to be applied by is not some super thing you have to have all kinds of doctor's degrees to do it it's just common everyday faith to believe god apply the blood by faith with the hyssop but let's make it so simple what is it it's just common faith it's not he says you try to make it some supernatural some super duper some really difficult thing that you have to have a certain sign you have to have a certain kind of gift you have to have a certain certain certain understanding and he says no just believe god amen it's that simple you just believe what he wrote believe what he said and just believe it and apply it to yourself and say that applies to me it's that simple we make it too complicated now the worshiper then seen beneath his this blood showed that he had carried out jehovah's request listen he didn't have to do extra he didn't get extra points for doing extra things he was just supposed to do what he was told to do take a lamb take one without blemish take it on a certain day in the evening time slay that lamb collect the blood put it on the lenth on the doors with common everyday common faith and then feast on the contents of the lamb in the home and be prepared for your exodus that was what they were supposed to do not to think of something better not to come up with another program but but if he said do this then he meant then obviously this would be even better if he wanted us to do this and he and he told us amen he told us to keep our staff in our hand well then i'm going to keep a book bag on my back too i mean if he meant that then that must mean this i mean we do this all the time this is so common for us well if he said this then it must also mean this and if he meant this then it could mean this too and if he meant that then wouldn't this be the maximum way to express that and we're always trying to produce something that makes us feel more comfortable instead of just doing the common thing just believe what he said just take it for face value and say it's the truth i believe it's the truth and i believe it will work for me so i'll read that again the worshiper then seen beneath his blood showed that he had carried out jehovah's request and he was identified the token showed he was identified with the slain lamb that jehovah had required the work was done what a perfect type today of christ in the believer when the token is displayed to the believer then it shows that it's been accepted and the work has been done then the blood was a token of identification the blood itself the animal blood died his blood was on the wall now animal life that was in the blood and the life is in the blood we know that the bible said so in science proves it life is in the blood so therefore when the animal was killed and the life was broken from the animal the blood had to be the chemistry of the blood to stand for the token because the life that was in the blood could not come upon the believer because it was an animal's life brother makes this so easy god was giving them a substitute and that substitute was foreshadowing a greater that would come but in god's economy he was allowing them to take the lamb and slay the lamb and apply the blood for an atonement for them so that they would be passed over in in the judgment of egypt so that they could remain alive and they could come out from under the token and go on to the promise now uh any and he said that the chemistry then the actual physical context of blind was painted on the lentil on the doorpost and because they that's all that they had left over when the life was gone when the life was spilt when the life left they had the chemistry and they took the chemistry and applied it proving that they had done all that jehovah had required it was evidence that they had done what jehovah had required so so but there that's as far as they could go because that life that left that animal the life that was in the blood could not come back upon them because it was a different kind of life it wasn't human life it was animal life so that's as far as they could go in that day but let's look at first peter first peter chapter 1. first peter chapter 1 verse 18 first for as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversations received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreign before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you now when we look at the the the story of redemption through the bible in eden and post eden and exodus and then through the law the shedding of blood the shedding of an innocent victim the substitute life the the all of these things now when we come to the new testament and we begin to read the things that peter's saying they they make such they make so much sense there's such another understanding that's coming because it was the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot he became the sacrifice he was the one that the father offered for his whole household and we are part of that household let's go to hebrews while we're here hebrews chapter 9. hebrews chapter 9 and verse 8 hebrews 9 and 8. the holy ghost this this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which we are off which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation but christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered it once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you see what what happened is when moses instructed the children of israel that when they heard the long blast and the voice of god that they were to go up to the mountain but instead they run afar off and they instructed moses you go we can't go you go so he did and when he went god now gives him ordinances and laws originally god was only going to give to israel the ten commandments what he said he gave to them and added none there too but when they refused to come unto him amen then stood afar off for fear now when moses went unto them now he says whatever he tells you will do so now god gives his ordinances because the people can no longer hear directly from him so now he's going to give them a book of ordinances and he writes down all the laws and all the rules all the first testament amen and moses comes down off the mountain after recording it in the book and he's got the book amen and the people agreed to abide by the book and he takes the blood of a bull of calves and of goats and of water or blood let me read that again i don't want to get that wrong he took the blood in verse 19 of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and them so the first covenant the first testament was sealed with blood sprinkled with blood and sealed and vindicated and purified by blood the book and the people amen were both sprinkled so let's keep going verse 21 moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in heaven should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for christ is not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the truth but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entered into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself so this this we're reading here about this term of sprinkling with blood this when moses sprinkled the people in the book he took the blood of the substitute offering with water and he dipped in scarlet wool and hyssop and he sprinkled the book and the people and the covenant was sealed amen and it was also purified because the sprinkling is a form of purification a form of purging a sanctifying and he did the same thing to the tabernacle in all the vessels he sprinkled them with water mixed with blood in the ashes of a heifer and with that he he purified sanctified he sprinkled he purged everything to go into service of the lord he purged every vessel he praised the high priest everything was sprinkled but the new testament now is going to come and talk about us being sprinkled but we've been sprinkled by better than this we've been sprinkled by another kind of blood and what does the sprinkling do the sprinkling is to purify us cleanse us for service look at first peter first peter chapter one first peter chapter one and verse 2 elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied god had made sure every vessel was sanctified cleansed purged by the sprinkling of blood but now you're a vessel that he wants to use you're a vessel that you're a tabernacle that he wants to dwell in you're a vessel that he wants to use so he sprinkled you by a better blood than these he sprinkled you by the blood of jesus christ so that you can be purified and cleansed so you can be a tabernacle that he can dwell in and that he can use you for his service so we've we've had a sprinkling by blood let's go to revelation chapter 1. revelation chapter 1. and verse 5 revelation 1 and 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood so this theme of blood runs from genesis to revelation the prophet of god says in in the message abraham from 1961 see when the old testament when they offered sin offering they took a little lamb laid their hands upon it confessed their sins and they cut its throat and then the little fellow was dying kicking and bleeding why the blood got all over the hands of the worshiper and then he felt the death going out of that animal as it straightened out and died and he knowed that that animal was dying in his place but the bible said that he went out with the same desire he had when he came in he there was a substitute the substitute was bearing his iniquity was bearing his sin he would lay his hands on the head of the animal as a as an indication that he's transferring his sin onto this animal and this animal is now bearing his sin and they would slay the animal and as he felt its struggle under the slaying and its blood leaving it die he realized that this animal died in my place and so now he left justified because god had forgiven him because he did what jehovah had required but when he left the same thing in him that made him sin the first time is still there the same desires the same trappings the same things are there with him as it was before so that blood couldn't take that away all it could do was cover it he goes on to say he said uh he came out with he went out with the same desire he had when he come in because see when the blood cell was broke that animal spirit could not come back and coincide with the human spirit the animal has no soul so they could not come back so therefore he went out with the same conscience but when a man by faith comes lays his hands upon the head of jesus christ and feels his suffering for your sins and when the blood cell was broke on calvary not only the life of a human being came back but the life of god comes back from it and makes you a son or daughter of god everything else was pointing to this this amen is what god was trying to accomplish in the token he says the only way only way anyone could tell that that house belonged to under the blood because the chemistry of the blood was on the doors he's back in the passover in the exodus the blood was on the doors they passed through the death angel had to look and see the blood now again it was a type of the holy spirit now see the literal blood of jesus could not come upon each one of us remember the bible says that we're sprinkled by the blood of jesus christ the bible says we're washed by the blood of jesus christ we're redeemed by the blood is that what the bible says but but we have to ask ourselves a question how do they get that blood on me if i have to be washed in the blood listen to what brother branham says i love the way i love brother branham being honest and being real amen because the rest of christianity is speaking in catchphrases and cliches and then when somebody asks them a question about it they just make it mystical they don't ever answer the question but brother branham says now the literal blood of jesus christ could not come upon each of us because he just had so much blood in his body and it's dripped off out of his body and into the ground 2 000 years ago but it wasn't to be for a token it was to be the purchase price of our redemption but not for our token remember the token in the passover was the blood the chemistry of the blood was a token that token was evidence that a lamb had died for this house you didn't hang the lamb there you put the blood there and because the blood the life was in the blood when you put the blood there it represented that a life had been slain that's what the token is but in this slaying of the lamb the chemistry of the blood was not to be our token it was to be the price of our redemption but there's something else that's supposed to be our token so i love brother branham is not speaking in fairy tales and he doesn't make everything so mystical that there that there's really no answer and you just go in these loops but he's speaking reality we're washed in the blood of the lamb we're redeemed by the blood we're sprinkled under the blood of christ all of those things are absolutely true but what blood amen what the chemistry i can't get my hands on that chemistry and if i have to be washed in that blood that was spilled at calvary the physical chemistry of the physical elements of the blood that blood went into the earth dried up the elements broke up how am i going to get that blood on me because i have to be washed in that blood we're left in a conundrum and then when you start talking in denominational realms you just shrug your shoulders i don't know oh i'm so thankful for a prophet of god so don't have to walk around say you got to be washing the blood well how do you get the blood i don't know but it'll be okay you know i know there's still sincere people in the world but it seems like religion has lost the sincerity of just going through the motions it's just action catch phrases and words and programs and going to church on sunday and wednesday but if somebody really wants to be clean they want to be right with god they want to be purified they want to know that i am in union with god i don't want to go through life without god i have a love for god a desire for god a need for god i want to be redeemed i want to be clean i want to be set free i don't want to go to church i don't just want to have religion but i want god amen and i got to be sprinkled by that blood purified by that blood washed in that blood now how am i going to get that blood and when the people shrug their shoulders the people just keep going to church and keep going home keep going to church and they come in singing about the blood and they go out with the same desire that they came in with is that right they come wanting to be washed in the blood wanting to be redeemed by the blood wanting to be cleansed by the blood but they come to church to worship sing the songs hear the sermon and they're just like the worshiper long ago they walk out with the same desire that they went in with that wasn't god's program i'm so thankful that god gave us the reality let's read this again the literal blood of jesus christ could not come upon each one of us because he just had so much blood in his body and it's dripped off out of his body into the ground 2 000 years ago but it wasn't to be for a token the life the life that was in the blood that was the token now and the passover it was the chemistry of the blood had to have an application so it could be seen and then you knew that you'd met jehovah's requirements but there's a token today and that token is not physical chemistry of physical blind but it's the life that was in the blood because we know that the blood is the life the life is in the blood we know by scripture so now that life that was in that blood that becomes my token that's what must be on display on the outside of my house he says the life the life that was in the blood was a token now i'll prove it to you just in a minute by the bible it is the token that's to come upon each of us to show that we have been identified with our sacrifice and have carried out jehovah's requests in the passover you could go outside and look at the door and say yep we're under the token but there's a token for today a true token a sure token what is that token it goes on in the same quote peter said on the day of pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to them that's far off as many as the lord our god shall call see not showing it just to them as many as the lord will call there is many think that they're called but the the lord calls those who he for for knew he called all he called he justified all who he justified he is glorified already the thing is settled and then when you take a person that doesn't believe the holy ghost is for the day see what they're doing they are denying the token which is the very symbol of the being of being connected with your sacrifice when they don't even believe the holy ghost is for today and i'll go further than that they don't even believe the word for the day they don't even believe the word for today they're denying the token which is the very symbol of the of being connected with your sacrifice it's the life that was in the word the life that was in jesus christ the life that was in the blood so you don't even believe there's a holy ghost you're denying the token which is the very symbol of the being of being connected with your sacrifice see what i mean it's very simple if you just look at it in the way that god has got it rolled out now the blood carried us shows the symbol of the holy spirit that is the life and again in token this is another token message but now the life that was in the blood becomes the token so now what is my token what is my evidence that i have met jehovah's requirements because i will only be saved in this day of destruction if i met jehovah's requirements and what is the evidence that i've met jehovah's requirements the token what is the token the life that was in the blood because i'm saying now when we identify ourselves in his death burial and resurrection by believing on him and being baptized into his death burial and resurrection then we rise up the holy spirit is there to give us a token an eternal token written across your heart soul makeup mind body everything else that you are a separated person from unbelief you are a separated person from the things of the world you are separated from death you are separated from everything and you are a product that god has sealed into the kingdom by his holy spirit there's the token but there it's but here it's his own life that was in the blood his own life that was in the blood it's the it's the life that was in the blood when the blood was shed the life was released but before when the life was released the life could never come back because the animal didn't have a soul and he has a different spirit than man and he cannot come into the man so it was just an atonement it was just a covering it was a substitute showing that would one come but when the life of a man a man god took on the life of a man because that spirit can come back into you amen the life of a man not the life of an animal but the life of the man so god became a man amen why did god become a man because of the fall in eden god became a man because he's got to take care of the problem with the blood amen he's got to fix the problem from eden so to fix the problem from eden he had to become a man what kind of man a full-blown human man but was born without sin amen no sex to it at all he was virgin born why was he virgin born because of the fall in eden eden god what's god doing he's fixing the problem he's redeeming us he's bringing out us out of corruption he's bringing us back to himself what does he do he comes as a man because there's got to be a life in the man and he creates blood he creates blood and it's the blood of his own life and when that blood is spilled now that life that leaves that sacrifice is now the same kind of life you have human life and now that life can come into you because you have a soul [Music] and that life coming into you amen changes your life quickens you until that life begins to live itself and that is the token to escape destruction in this day that's the token the life that was in that sacrifice i'm going to keep reading there's still more i want to get to i'm not not near done yet be patient we're close but kind of read that again but the life itself is the token for without the circumcision without the token you're not even in the covenant the whole thing works together if you say you're circumcised to the word and then only then you believe the word if you believe i want you to listen how simple brother branham never makes this complicated if you believe the word then the token has got to come for he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the mission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost there you are believe him now you can't go get baptized in jesus name and not believe it i mean you can't just go through the motions but first you have to believe you have to repent what are you repenting from i'm born wrong everything about me is wrong you can say i grew up in the message i never smoked never drank never i mean i didn't even use a curse word i just used some bad slang one time you can still repent because you were born wrong amen if you come from a mother and a father you were born wrong and must repent and recognize that i'm wrong i'm hopelessly wrong i will never be right whether i was born in the raids in the message or not whether i never say i swear word my whole life and go to church every sunday i am still wrong i need to repent i need something else i need another life the life in me is wrong it's corrupted it's perverted it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong it'll be wrong everybody needs a new birth no matter where you're born or what church you attend and what home you were growing up in because it's wrong amen but god created a sacrifice amen god himself became a living being a human being with human life amen so that he could that he could die amen and that blood could be shed and the life that was in that blood could come back into you after you repent believe god believe the full word of god amen repent and are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and if you go through those steps you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it's an absolute guaranteed promise of god and that holy ghost amen is the token is the evidence that you've met his requirements what are his requirements repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that's it what are the rest what's the rest of the list brother chad that's it but i thought we had to the brother brother told us how a christian should dress and we shouldn't go to these certain places and how a man should treat his wife and listen get the holy ghost and it'll take care of the rest of that amen that's not you can't get the car before the horse meet his requirements and repentance recognize you're wrong you're completely wrong you're all wrong and there's no way for you to be right but god made a way himself amen and if we accept that by faith and believe that it was for us recognizing our failure and repent and give our life to him and believe the whole world and are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he has given a promise god will not go back on that promise you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost when you receive the gift of the holy ghost then everything brother ben says in the message makes sense then we stop asking silly questions like like on a boy how long is long hair like if it's over my ears if it's down my all that goes away because if you listen to what the prophet said with the life in you you say absolutely i want to look as clean and as holy as i possible i want to be everything that jesus christ would be in my flesh because it's jesus christ living in your flesh amen meet the requirement and then you'll receive the token the token is the evidence you've met the requirement and then it's not a life that we live on our own it's a life he comes in and lives through us in the message calling jesus on the scene he says now the spirit life lays in the blood and when the blood cell of a lamb or an animal was broken the life that was in that cell could not come back on the worshipper because it was an animal and we are human being we are different the animal doesn't have a soul the human being has a soul so the spirit could not come back upon him after he made his offering but yet he made it and sincerely speaking with faith that he believed that the perfect offering was coming but when the blood cell was broken jesus christ god was released i want you to catch that this is a profound statement when the blood cell was broken jesus christ god was released see he was god the blood wasn't jewish the blood wasn't gentile that was a creative blood cell god himself and now through that blood making a propitiation for our sins cleanses the believer takes all of the sins away from him as if he had never had sinned god puts them in the sea of forgiveness and the same god that was upon jesus christ continues in the believer doing the same works that he did here for it's the same spirits praise be to god there's there's a statement brother brandon makes in um christ is the mystery of god revealed and he's talking about god's great plan that he had in the back part of his mind to get preeminence into man give preeminence and a people and when he comes to this second part this is what he says this is paragraph 144 he said secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people so that's the second full purpose of his threefold plan what god's great plan was he wanted to live in people now listen what he says next now he could do that in adam and eve that's what they were created for that's what god wanted he wanted to become a family upon the earth and live in the people he said but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again so what's he doing he's getting it back again what happened what happened in the beginning what was it blood amen so what's he doing blood he's bringing it back again he has to get it back again amen now again in christ's mystery god revealed he says christ is risen and has paid the price of our redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed that god in his redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day god could do that in adam and eve but sin separated it so he had to find a way to get it back and his plan to get it back was blood he goes on to say as i said if the life of beethoven was in you you would live like beethoven pretty simple if the life of hitler was in you you would live like hitler and when the life of christ is in you you'll live like christ and the works of christ you do and that'll be if christ lived today he would do exactly what the word said he would do today so he said if christ was living today he would do he would live that portion of the word for this day which is the bride's portion you're living today if you've been born again by the spirit of god amen that life has come back in you what is christ doing in you he's living that portion of the word for the day the bride manifestation the bride portion in galatians 3 i'm just going to read this galatians 3 26 for you are all children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you have been baptized into christ have put on christ now it's christ not me now let's go to hebrews chapter 12 and i want to just wrap up with this thought here hebrews chapter 12. hebrews chapter 12 verse 22 but you are coming to mount zion into the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly to the church of the firstborn that are written in heaven into god the judge of all and the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant into the blood of sprinkling that's purifying that speaketh better things than that of abel that speaketh better things than that of abel it this is an interesting scripture i've looked at brother bram says much about him but you've come to jesus the media of the new covenant into the blood of sprinkling that's the blood of your purifying that speaketh better things than that of abram if we could turn to genesis chapter 4. genesis chapter 4 in verse 9. and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and hebrews talks about now we've come to the blood of jesus the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than abel and the blood of abel was crying out to the lord and brother branham told us if you look into the message he said the blood of abel was crying out against cain the blood of the of the one that was slain the blood of the righteous that was slain was crying out to the lord but it was crying out against the guilty and it was a cry against the wounded and done slaying and the lord could hear the voice of of the blood of abel crying out to the lord from the ground and it was crying out against it was speaking against cain but we've come to the blood of sprinkling of a purification that speaks better things than the blood of abel because now that blood is not crying out against the guilty it's crying out for the guilty on behalf of the guilty that blood is crying out to have mercy crying out for grace crying out for an atonement crying out for a covering amen we've come there's a different voice this voice of the sprinkling of this blood is crying out better things than the voice of abel's blood abel's blood was crying out against cain his blood is crying out for us amen for redemption for salvation for atonement for recovering for redemption to cover the mistake in the garden this blood of this sprinkling is speaking better things than that of abel this is not a voice of condemnation anymore but this blood is crying out for mercy crying out for grace crying out for an atonement can you hear the voice is it calling out forgive them father they know not what they're doing you see the voice of abel amen you can find that same kind of life unregenerate life in the souls under the altar and the fifth seal because those jews they haven't been born again by the spirit of god they were just living as true to the word as they knew how but the souls under the altar i mean they're crying out how long o lord till thou avenge us those souls were voices blood that had been shed martyrs that had been martyred blood of jews of innocent have been shed and they like abel are crying out against the guilty but when jesus when his blood was being spilled from his body on calvary and he's nailed to the cross and the blood is leaving his body and running to the ground he's saying father forgive them they don't know what they're doing i tell you the voice of this blood speaks better things than that of abel but when that life comes into you and i now our voice the life the the the the voice of that blood life is now crying out through a people and it's not crying out against the guilty it's cry out god have mercy god forgive god's save god cover what is it you're crying out we're crying out the gospel friends we're crying out the word we've got the blood we've got the life now there's an atonement that's still available praise be to god brother says in the token now sign of the full obedience fear is gone paul tells us that the blood speaks better things you say the blood speaks yep the blood speaks in genesis 4 10 we find out that god said the cane or abel's blood spoke out of the earth we find out in hebrews 12 that the blood of the covenant of christ speaks better things than that of abel we find out the blood does speak it speaks in your behalf the life that's in you speaks from the shed blood what's crying on your behalf the life that's in you it's not crawling out from the ground it's not calling out from under the altar it's calling out from inside of you it's speaking on your behalf i mean oh brother i wish everybody could see that if you can see that it's the life that's in you the blood is identifying you with it it's the token what it is the blood was shed for you you've accepted and the life has come into you you have the token that's the holy spirit this is where brother brown makes that statement we've mentioned it many times and christ is the mystery of god revealed he said the church is the blood of christ the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because where is the life of christ all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured where into the church so where is the spirit of christ in the church where is the life that was in that blood in the church it's in you and i brother it's crying out it's crying out on our behalf it's the token speaking for us that we've met jehovah's requirements we're safe from wrath we're safe from destruction we've been saved what declares you've been saved his life in me declares it's the token that declares i'm saved outside of that there's no guarantee see his life has come in you and you have the token that's the holy spirit the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood where i can no longer find the chemistry of the blood but the life that was in that blood is here it's crying out from earth from dirt all the way back in leviticus he tells those who are hunting and those who slam an animal to take the blood and cover it in dust but in this day god has taken that blood life and he's covered it in dust my dust and your dust and that life is living on the inside of earthen vessels and it's crying out but it's a cry it's crying for us on our behalf he goes on the same possessing the gate to the enemy i spoke on it at houston somewhere i mean dallas the token a jew could show down in israel that he was a jew by circumcision but god said when i see the blood and the blood shall be a token unto you it shall be a token the life that was in the blood could not come in the worshipper because well it was animal life it was only a shadow coming up to the real life then the chemistry of the blood itself had to be read upon the door and the post of the door applied by hyssop we're coming back to this thought and i want you we've mentioned before but i want you to hone in on it again applied by hyssop which is just a common weed showing that you don't have to have super faith you just have to have some to have the same the faith you got like you have to start your car come to church a lot of people think that they got to have something but no that's wrong just common faith is all you have to apply the blood by hear the word believe the word apply it that's all i'm waiting until something magnificent happens i'm waiting for some super duper faith till i can speak something into existence he said no just take the common faith that you've got to believe the word of god and believe what he said and then apply it and if you believe it and apply it according to the scriptures then the tokens got to come and the token is the evidence that you believed the word and applied it he goes down a couple paragraphs later but when jesus the son of god virgin born shed his blood the life that was in that blood was god itself the bible said we are saved by the life the blood of god not the blood of jew not the blood of a gentile but the life of god god created this this blood cell virgin born then he goes on to say now that in doing this he coming from him was god the spirit that spirit became upon the believer therefore the life that was in our sacrifice we are identified by that same life that is our token the the blood was the plan from the beginning because the blood what brought life into corruption but god is going to bring our life out of corruption and someday he'll change the very elements of this body but right now he's changed us by injecting his own life into us what do i have to do to get that brother to do i have to pray all night do i have to fast for three days take the simple faith that you got to believe his word do you believe his word then you've got the hyssom did he provide the blood he provided the blood he's given us the word he's told us how to apply it just take the hyssop that's in your hand and repent repent for your wrong life repent for being born wrong repent for everything in you being wrong repent for delaying repent for putting him off repent for over complicating things take him out his word and said if he said if i repent and are baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission sins i shall receive the gift of the holy ghost then that life that was released at calvary will come into me and that is my token that is my evidence that i met jehovah's requirements it's the life what's the blood all about the blood through the whole bible is about life that's what it's about it's about true life the real life the genuine life our life was perverted but his life wasn't so unperverted life comes to correct our perverted life to bring us back into an unperverted life again that's the whole story of the bible that's the gospel that's why it's blood from the beginning blood to the end that's why he was a lamb slain from the foundation of the world and your names were put in there because god knew what was going to happen he he allowed it to go this way so that we would gain understanding through this life but he provided everything we needed in this life and he provided a blood as a substitute because ours was corrupt and now he's provided a life from the blood because our life was corrupt to bring us back to the right life look at first john chapter 1. first john chapter 1 and verse 5 5 first john 1 5. this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him has no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin what must i do to have this sprinkling of this blood walk in the light as he is in the light let's turn to the gospel of john john chapter 1. john chapter 1 and verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god we know later in verse 14 he says and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us when that word was made flesh it had blood created blood god's created blood and when that shed it was the blood of the word made flesh that's why brother ben would later come and say the word it bled for you it died for you because the full word of god was made into a flesh body and that flesh body was going to be the sacrifice the lamb of god there was a life inside that life and that life was the life of god that was released at the shedding of that blood and that life now could come back in the believer what god wanted to do in eden but was ruined by sin now he can do what he couldn't do for the entire old testament by the shedding of that blood that life can now come and dwell inside of you and god can dwell with his people again but it was the word that made an atonement for us that's why it's the word that brings us back to him and it says he goes on here in verse 2 the same was in the beginning with god what the word all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life remember what's this whole issue of blood it's about life in him was life and the life was the light of men that life was the light of men the illumination of men that life is what gave men life and light and that was perverted in the garden but now if we walk in the light as he is in the light what's light the life is the light what is walking what is if we walk in the light as he is in the light we're walking in his life because his word is spirit and his life it's all about life that's why in this day we can't look i mean we can't we can't talk about things that had happened eons ago and thousands of years ago but we have to we have to walk in the light as he is in the light because he is the life and the life is the light amen in the word has life and the word was made life in the word bled and died for us so we must come to him and walk in the light as he is in the light and if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin that's why these denominational systems will fail and continue to fail and they're not really getting anybody anywhere because god has come and he's given us the light to walk in and if we walk in that light that's where the life is and this issue of blood is all about life and it's the life that's purifying our life and when we walk in this life and then we really know what we were and we know that god changed us we could we we couldn't overcome ourselves we couldn't live this word but another life come inside and that life began to walk us step and step with the word and as he revealed the word we would repent and we would line up to the word and as he would review more we would repent and line up to the word and we begin to walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of jesus christ is cleansing us from all sin in that life that is in us causing us to line to the word that life is our token it is my evidence i had no capacity to live right before i could fake it on sunday but i couldn't live it in my private life i could pretend to be a believer sunday and wednesday and when other believers were around amen but when i was a boy growing up in the church i could pretend i knew the cliches i knew the catch phrases i knew when to raise my hands i knew when to respond and i wasn't doing it to be a hypocrite although i was a hypocrite i was doing it genuinely because i did love the lord and i wanted to be right i had a desire to be right so i was doing everything because i wanted to be right but no matter how much i did right inside i could never be right i would go to church and worship and leave with the same desire to cause me to sin the day before but something changed with this message all of a sudden i realized that god is his word how can i receive the baptism of the holy ghost and have the life of the word on the inside and refuse to live the word refuse to believe the word to refuse to acknowledge the message it's impossible because the life of the word is the life that's in me something changed and now when nobody's looking i still serve god doesn't mean i've lived a life without failures without regrets without repentances without things that i'm still ashamed of but something changed friends it's different now now it's not about uh uh i'm i just want to be right i still want to be right but it's not about the it's the desire has changed i don't want anything of this world i want nothing i want nothing to do with it i don't want anything else what i want more than anything else is i want him i want to please him i want him to be happy with me i want to satisfy him that's all i want in this life i want him to live through me but did it i'll tell you what did it for me recognizing that what that prophet said was the truth and it was the scripture and as simple as taking a little bit of hyssop that was in my hand and saying lord i'm sorry for misunderstanding you all these years i'm sorry for living a hypocritical life i'm sorry for trying to be a christian i'm sorry for all of those things but i'm going to repent and i'm going to be baptized according to the scriptures in the name of the lord jesus christ that was the simple act of obedience that it took for something to change inside of me to come to the word to acknowledge the word and take the simple faith that is in our hands and just apply the word and believe it and let god bring the token the evidence that you've met his requirements a false repentance won't do it a baptism with no sincerity but a repentance and a sincerity and obedience to the word will bring the promise of the word let's just keep it simple how many are thankful that there's been blood we've been born wrong you know you were born wrong with no hope but he was born right and he lived right and he surrendered right and he did everything right and he was the perfect man with the perfect life and the perfect surrender but now that life has been sprinkled upon me to purify my life and i've received the token that i've met jehovah's requirements and i'm as secure as secure can be not by works but i'm secure the same way abel was secure because he met jehovah's requirements he understood what happened he knows why and now we're not just going through motions we're not just repeating after parents you know my dad did i do my grandma did i do the pastor says i repeat but now the message has come to show us why it's blood what happened to the life what the substitutes were all about and why we don't still offer animal sacrifices because the substitutes were only pointing to the true the true has come now that's done away with now we have the truth but now how do i get the application of the blood i receive that life i received the word and received the life of the word and when i received the life of the word the life of the word comes in me and lives the word out of me that simple that's what this blood is all about it's about life now to have his blood is to have his life to have his life is to have the token to have the token is to have an evidence that he's received i've obeyed his commandments and i've met his requirements and he's accepted me i say thank you lord jesus what a day we live in friends no more no more confusion but an absolute understanding of what christ has done for us i thank god let's all stand musicians if you could come i just had a question why blood and a couple days later i was really happy looking at why blood what is it with all this blood it's about life friends it's about his life let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the privilege of being here this morning god not just being here this morning but being in this age lord where you would take the veil off of your bible where you would tell us the truth lord reveal to us lord what has happened in this life what this word is all about it's been a mystery lord men have probed that for generations lord probed that tried to understand wanted to understand but god you've been so good to us that you've allowed us to come in this age when you would take the veil off of the bible and show us what it's all about god i'm so thankful that there's a life available there's a token lord that's on the on the earth in this day god we've come to another time of destruction when this world will be destroyed but god you've made sure that you've got a token for us so that when the death angel passes we'll be safe god i pray if there's any here who has no confidence lord in that token they don't know lord they haven't been simple enough just to take you at your word let you do the work i pray that they come back to the simplicity of faith in your word that they would receive the truth that you've given in this day the full truth that they would repent lord for for for not receiving the full truth till now that they would surrender their own ideas that they would surrender their own wants and desires lord that they would just come to a repentance lord recognizing that they were wrong and if they haven't got this life they're not right yet god i prayed they would repent under that understanding lord and if they haven't already that they would come lord and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of their sins so that they would have confidence lord in what simple faith you've given them just to take you at that word they could have total rest and confidence knowing that you will fill them with the baptism of the holy ghost for you promised it lord god for those of us who have received this token the devil's tried to confuse us lord and tried to get us discouraged and get us down let us renew our joy lord our our our joy our satisfaction or our praise because of what you've done for us when we could do nothing you did it all god you've only asked us to believe but you've given a seed of predestination on the inside that could believe you made it all possible lord we didn't do anything you did it all for those of us who received this token and know that we've been accepted that we've met your requirements lord let that joy of our salvation come back lord let that joy in the spirit come back that we know all is well with me oh i don't care what happens to my flesh i don't care what happens in this world or happens amen to the circumstances in my life lord i know that you have accepted me and your life is in me and i'm secure from all harm oh god let that joy be refreshed and be renewed in this day maybe we walk out of here with a lighter step lord with a greater freedom lord may all the worries and anxieties of the devil just fade away because all is right lord from before the foundation of the world you knew we would be here you knew we would need a token you knew we would need the true gospel you knew in this hour of deception we would need to know the truth of what happened in the garden and you provided it all so that we could be free god i praise your name lord i thank you for that freedom lord for that salvation for your life to correct my wrong life for the new birth lord to correct my first birth oh god you're bringing back what was lost in eden and you're bringing it back in me oh how happy i am lord god bless your people as we go from here have a time of fellowship take some food lord in the natural come back for communion i pray that we would come back with such a joy such a satisfaction such a revelation that we could take that cup with such confidence lord that it's your life that has corrected our life it is your life that has purged and perfected our life and that the blood is speaking through us today speaking on our behalf you're crying out father forgive them wash them cleanse them thank you for the voice and these tabernacles god we love you we ask that you would bless us and that you would get preeminence once again in a body of people upon this earth that that would come to perfection in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you brother i will serve [Music] i love greece [Music] before you found me [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] i just want to remind you that we'll have communion and feet washing here for we'll do the vote of confirmation for the officers right away so if you could be here a little early that'd be great and then we'll go into the song service and the communion just want to add one one thing when god had a way of escape when he had a token available for his people he didn't make it complicated he made it possible he didn't make them go through extravagant things he didn't tell them you know bring me the foreskins of 400 egyptians he didn't make it grand feats and difficult accomplishments and he didn't make it marathons and all of these things he made it something they could do he gave him something they could do and what they did proved that they believed what he said and accepted it to be true and their worship vindicated that they received the life of the lamb and in this day god requires a new birth does he require a token he requires a token just like in the passover requires a token why would god require a token and not make it possible for his people to have it or make it so difficult and so complicated but he's put it in our hands we've got enough faith to receive the word and say i'll just do what he said do and believe that he'll do what he said he would do let's just receive it that way and receive the holy ghost receive it just receive it upon the basis of the word receive it upon our conduct our action and obedience to the word now receive the holy ghost of the gift and let god do what god's gonna do but quit putting it off and quit jumping through some man-made hoops and quit making things complicated there's no maze to get to the holy ghost there's no difficult journey there's just a simple obedience and a surrender to the word and do what he said do and if you do what he said do then believe that he'll do what he said he would do now you'll receive the gift of the baptism of the holy ghost nowhere in the bible did god make it impossible for his elect seed to find redemption he made it within their reach and god has made it within our reach all he asks us to do is believe the word and apply it let's just do that with the simple faith that we have then god bless you as you go let's sing that song again brother ben i will serve thee because i love thee you have given life [Music] me [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're [Music] [Applause] and what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood [Music] nothing but the blood [Music] is [Music] [Music] i know [Music] nothing but [Music] this [Music] is [Music] [Music] nothing can force [Music] nothing [Music] is [Music] [Music] and this is [Music] is all my righteousness [Music] is [Music] [Music] i know nothing but love [Music] oh precious here's the flow [Music] [Applause] one more time [Music] [Music] hey
