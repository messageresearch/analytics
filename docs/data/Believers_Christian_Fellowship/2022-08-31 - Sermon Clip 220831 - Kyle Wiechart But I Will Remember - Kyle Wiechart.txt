========================================

david in his mind goes back to the the stories of old and he goes back to moses and here's god with a mighty outstretched hand delivering the children of israel from the egyptians he's taking them he's bringing down flies he's bringing in frogs he's bringing in darkness he's he's sending the death angel land god is mightily on the move to set his children free and in the process of them coming free he brings them right up to a red sea this is a shocking thing and all of david wandering he gets encouraged and he remembers oh god you haven't forsaken me oh god you never forsake your people many times you just lead us to the red sea and we can't see your footsteps anymore where did you go i don't know where you went lord but you promised you'd be with me and this encouraged david and his inspiration struck him and said you didn't leave me lord you just brought me to a red sea and i just don't know where you're at but he knew the footsteps were going right through that red sea he didn't couldn't see him anymore but david had a confidence and he remembered the lord and when he remembered the lord he was encouraged and the recognition that god never forsakes his people he just takes you to a point in time he likes to test you a little bit see what kind of stand you're going to take take you to a point you don't know where you're going you don't know if he's forgotten about you you don't know if he's just totally done with you and then just to see what you will do god likes to do these things he likes to bring us into situations where it looks like god do you want to destroy me i mean you have to think what were the hebrew children saying thank you lord you brought me from here by here wonderful look at all that and then uh oh red sea lord did you did you forsake me lord have you forgotten about me no if they could have only recognized that red sea was going to be their deliverance and the destruction of their enemy see what the devil intends for evil god always uses it for good and what they did not recognize that the difficulties and they couldn't understand and the trials that was right before them was only the thing that was setting up to bring the deliverance that they had to have and was going to be in the destruction permanently they would never see their enemy again and this has consistently and always been the pathway of the believer you're he's there with you one day and you know he's walking with you and you can see him you can feel him you know he's walking it's like lord it's like oh wow you're with me everywhere i go in every decision and then before long you're just wonderful it's fantastic and then lord where did you go did you lead me into a trap did you lead me into something you want me to be destroyed no see this was the question david had david was really curious but the spirit of the lord came upon him inspiration struck me said no i remember i've seen this before i know how you deal with your children i know exactly now what you are doing you've not led me to destruction you're bringing my deliverance
