========================================

somewhere the prophet of God said that once you see this message you will see nothing else but this message once you seek Christ you see nothing else but Christ because you're not using this that ey is amen down there that's right it sees where nobody else is able to see he said there was never been any rains from Heavens the skies were always clear there were no clouds never had been a cloud upon the Earth why because it was God's program to water vegetation through the springs and things but Noah because God said that eye is connected to God's voice amen that eye is connected to God's saying and when it's connected there's a fear there love there because he will never allow anything in between but Noah because of because that God said it's going to rain he saw the rain coming 120 years before one drop fell it's a long range Vision yeah amen amen and he made preparations to get away to get away from it and ever since he heard that word there was something beating in his bosom like a possession it's it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain so just think for 120 years this is what was beating in in in Noah's heart even when they were inside of the the ark was already built sitting there went 7 days no drain even his family testing time came I can see no was wife said husband could you review that that message you preached it the other day even the sons yeah amen yes but the prophet of God said as they were sitting there the seventh day they felt something got loose in the bottom she was floating Noah was resting that eye the eye of the Lord is the only thing that can give you rest amen it shows you exactly who you are where you are and then you are resting amen
