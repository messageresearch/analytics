========================================

religion see that is satan's business not to kill the whole thing but just contaminate it that's all he ain't going to kill the whole thing oh not communist no no the antichrist is not communism the bible said it would deceive the elect if it was possible don't notice the iron curtain but the purple one the catholic one the false religion the church and he says religion is satan's business he not to kill the whole thing now listen that we understand that and the great the great uh concept that's been brought to us of the fallacy of denominations and false religion under the purple curtain and the mother having daughters and all of that but listen the the the devil he'll get into and if he can make the message religious and not personal then hasn't he done the same thing if he can if he can make the message just a form of religion and we can have a religion for religious form of worship in the message but take away the individual connection between you and christ amen you individually connected to a living god having met jesus christ personally and haven't even personally revealed to you but can move into the realm whereby a religious order of believing the message and being in a message church now i'm okay hasn't he accomplished the same thing so we can always say we see it here and we see it there but the devil hasn't quit working just because we come into a message church and say i believe the prophet he's still trying the same old tactics he's always trying so we've got to be careful that the message never becomes religion for us or we never let it become religion for our children amen but it has the message is personal amen it's not group it's never group it never it never will be group the message is to the individual this revelation is to one person and you decide who that person is but i've already decided who it is for me
