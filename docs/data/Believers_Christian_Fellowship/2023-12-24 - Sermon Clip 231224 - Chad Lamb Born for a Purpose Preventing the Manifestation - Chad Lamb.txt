========================================

you remember the prophecy you heard in Isaiah 7 a virgin shall conceive yeah I've heard it all my life it was a Sunday School uh uh memory verse that I I got a star on my chart from remembering and Gabriel says that's you you're that scripture Isaiah was talking about you God had you in mind before the found I mean that may not be the dialogue that took place but that was the point of the conversation and now this little girl she had to come to terms with the fact that she was the word yeah Amen in her flesh is going to be the manifestation of that word that word was speaking about her she is the manifestation that word is going to come to light and bear light in her flesh and you know what because she's a seed of God she believed it amen she had some questions she had some concerns but after talking to the angel amen the angel told her you're it and she believed it she received it you know what she became she became the light of her hour is that right she was the word made manifest she was light and that light can bring life and now she finds out she's got a cousin and that cousin also has a word inside of her amen a predestinated word in her because there's a prophecy in Malachi 3 there's a prophecy in Isaiah of one that will prepare the way of the Lord that make straight his path there's a word now that word is laying in Elizabeth we're on the same page now her cousin Elizabeth has the word in her now Mary has the word in her that's been quickened to life the problem is Elizabeth has not felt the quickening power yet this word is laying there dead in her womb that's right the word is in her but the word has no life it's dead brother man said she never felt the baby kick yet it was dead it was 6 months she was starting to get concerned I love the word of God God no doubt she had prayed God I don't feel anything you promised in your word amen your your angel said to Zachariah amen we we know that this is the the the one that's coming and I don't feel anything there's no change in my life I it feels dead like it's not alive amen and and she could pray she could ask Zachariah to pray they may even fast and pray amen but what is it going to take it's going to take that little verse virgin girl with the word awake inside of her the manifested word for her day when she comes in contact with Elizabeth and she begins to declare the message that she received that this I'm blessed of the Lord I'm going to have a baby his name is Jesus and when she heard that word that had come to life and and and and Mary the word in Mary that was alive brought the word laying dormant in Elizabeth and it sprung to life life came to life word came to word manifested word came to promised word and sprung to life in her wound and started leaping and jumping around you think your testimony doesn't do anything it's your testimony that brings life amen you're not just here to take up space you're not just here to breathe oxygen in and out you're not just here to retire and have a retirement you're here to testify of the truth that's why we were born we have been born and we've come into this life to testify of the truth so that the truth in US being manifest can bring a seed that's laying dormant somewhere else to life let it be Christmas all over again
