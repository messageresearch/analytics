give us strength to live the life you've called us to live in this hour we love you we give you preeminence in this place we ask that all that we say and do would be pleasing to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you while we're standing let's turn to the Book of Psalms together I'll begin reading there man I want to as you're turning I want to remind everybody that this Sunday brother Joseph Scott and I will be heading to India to visit brother Roshan so we appreciate you praying for us also that'll be Sunday evening we're leaving we'll be here in the morning I I tend to preach the Sunday morning service this Sunday and then Sunday night we'll be flying out but Sunday morning brother Emmanuel and sister Mimi it's a boss who are traveling over to the Democratic Republic of Congo to do some work for some Churches there so we want to be praying for them as well and they'll be gone almost the exact same time we will so we'll be praying for each other won't we brother Emmanuel amen amen let's turn to Psalms 37 and begin reading there Psalms 37 I'm going to read two verses verse 39 and verse 40. but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him amen God bless you as you're seated I I love this he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him and and if if we want the Lord to deliver us then we need to stop delivering ourselves and just trust in him amen we need to start trying we need to stop uh uh um over protecting analyzing trying to figure out amen all of these things we just need to trust in him and if we trust in him he will protect us amen he is our strength in the time of trouble and he will save us because we trust in him so we need to do is trust in him amen there's a a quote out of the church age book from the Philadelphian Church days that says it is in the midst of a time of great trouble that Jesus comes and with his coming there is a resurrection many are to come forth Out of the Dust and rise with those who are alive but waiting for his return so we know the context of the statement I read a little more to get the context of the statement but I just wouldn't take for a title uh this evening in a time of great trouble Jesus comes and many of us have experienced this in our lives God showing up on the scene in a time of great trouble amen he's promised to do this for us and he is our strength in a time of trouble and it is in the midst of a time of great trouble that Jesus comes and let's turn the book of Hebrews and we're going to grab a couple more scriptures here Hebrews and we'll go back to Psalms Hebrews chapter 13. Hebrews 13. 5. Hebrews 13 and 5. let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man shall do unto me amen he has promised to never leave us or forsake us so we can trust in him because his word will never fail and if he made it as a promise that promise will stand forever he will never leave us and he will never forsake us so that we can boldly say the Lord is my helper I don't need any other helper I'm not looking the government I'm not looking to savings I'm not looking I mean I'm not looking to anything else the Lord is my helper because he promised he'll never leave me nor forsake me and that promise gives me the boldness to say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do to me Amanda we need not fear what any other human being can do because God has promised that he would take care of us let's go back to the book of Psalm and read Psalm chapter 3 together and we're going to read the entirety of Psalm chapter 3. Psalm 3 and 1 says Lord how are they increased that troubled me many are they that rise up against me many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him and God see love but thou O Lord are a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of mine head I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hills I laid me down and slept I awakened for the Lord sustained me I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about arise oh Lord Save Me O my God for thou has smitten all my enemies upon the cheekbone thou has broken the teeth of the ungodly salvation belongeth unto the Lord thy blessing is upon thy people amen you know this is a Psalm of David that he wrote when Absalom rebelled against amen and for David this was a physical need for physical salvation and but many times what was physical for the Jews is spiritual for us and we're compassed about by demon forces by demonic forces by evil spirits that are constantly trying to derail us or overcome us Amen in many ways but God has promised to be our shield and our buckler he's the one who takes care of us we can lay down and sleep and raise up for he has sustained us amen we don't have to keep ourselves and and you know this is there's so many spiritual battles going on around us around us that we cannot fight in a physical way amen so we become when it comes to the physical elements we become so helpless to fight these battles we need a God who can fight for us and a God who can sustain us amen and so he has promised that he will be around us surrounding us watching over us and we can trust in him so I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people there's so many scriptures that tell us to not be afraid amen Don't Be Afraid let your heart and be not troubled don't be afraid and and we need to take these to heart because if God is our helper he is our helper amen if he's ever been our helper he'll always be our helper if we're his child and we're in his in his kingdom and part of his plan he's promised to watch over us we're in his Strong Tower amen he is our shield and our buckler he is the lifter of our head he is our Salvation he is our strength he is our Defender he is our all in all amen and we can rest in him and trust that we don't have to fear medical diagnosis we don't have to fear economies we don't have to fear Wars we don't have to fear any of the situations that we're facing we don't have to fear because God has made a promise to his people [Music] and in the time of great trouble Jesus comes let's go look in the Book of Daniel together we're going to look at two stories that are so very familiar to us but I want to look at them in this context Daniel chapter 3. and verse 23. Daniel Daniel chapter 3 and verse 23. and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace so we all from that context know the story so well they refused to bow to the image that the king had erected and then refusing they knew they would face death and and they were told they were given an opportunity to Bow and they could go free but they refused before the king and the King warned them that you'll be cast into the furnace and they said our God is able to deliver us but even if he doesn't Will Not Bow Down and now they're cast into the fiery furnace verse 24 then Kevin Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonied and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto him unto the king true O King he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of God in a time of great trouble Jesus comes and a time of great trouble he makes his appearance amen he shows that he's present amen I I I don't believe that that was the first time and amen that that the Son of God was in their midst that's when he made himself known that's when he appeared amen he was with them up the ramp he was with them all the way he was with him when they denied the king amen but but he made his appearance and the King saw it amen let's go to verse 28. then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who has sent his Angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's words and yielded their bodies that they may not serve nor worship any God except their own God they didn't need to save themselves because God would send his Angel amen so the angel of the Lord amen is the Lord amen and the angel Lord came on the scene and he saw the fourth man amen as the Son of God and a time of great trouble Jesus came let's go on to uh chapter 6 now and look at Daniel in similar fashion Daniel was tested because he had prayed to the Lord three times a day and and you know through through accountingly devised plan the other wise men and the princes convinced the king to make a law against praying to any other God but he himself and he fell for the trick and he made the law and Daniel got caught in the Trap and he was going to be thrown into the lion's den and he was thrown alive into the lion's den and the King came back and the next morning and he and he hollers oh Daniel was your God able to save you and let's look at verse 21 here Daniel 6 and 21 then said Daniel unto the king O King live forever my God hath sent his Angel and has shut the Lion's mouths and they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee O King have I done no hurt God has sent his angel in a time of great trouble Jesus came amen and so we don't have to fear anything I think we all know that we live in a bit of an unpredictable time it's things are changing and in in the world and it's a very unpredictable time and there's a lot of uncertainty and who knows what will happen things can go on as they are for a long large period of time they could change rapidly who knows what will happen but no matter what happens there's no reason to be afraid let's turn to Psalms 91. Psalms 91 this Psalm blessed me immensely when we think of this topic in this subject Psalm 91 verse 1. he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God and him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at Noonday A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee Only With Thine eye shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all the way thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against the stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder the Young Lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet because he hath set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation I love that verse 15 I will be with him in time of trouble with him in trouble in time of great trouble we don't have to worry he is here when we look at this Psalm 91 there's a promise in here and and it looks as if nothing bad will ever happen no sickness no harm no hurt but yet all through the lives of Christians there's been sickness there's been there's been physical injury there's been all this other things but I'd like to point out that nothing will hurt you no matter what happens it won't hurt you sickness won't hurt you injury won't hurt you amen troubles won't hurt you amen family troubles won't hurt you political troubles won't hurt you amen nothing will hurt you when you realize what you is I don't know if that's good grammar or not but when you realize what you is you'll know that nothing will hurt you amen sickness can't hurt you nothing can hurt you when you realize what you really are who you really are and what is the real part of you amen let's go and look at Luke chapter 10. we find as we mature in Christ we have to stop thinking carnally and begin to think spiritually Luke chapter 10 verse 19. Jesus now speaking to the disciples after they've come back from the campaign he sent him on two by two into the cities and they cast out Devils healed the sick and they come and brought him a report and in verse 19 he says behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you amen nothing shall by any means hurt you amen some of the people he was speaking to would be stoned to death some of them would have their heads cut off John would be boiled in oil trying to kill him so there was many things that would happen Amen to the to the fleshly bodies of the individuals he was speaking to but the statement remains true amen nothing shall by any means hurt you brother Brown says in the message Shalom like in the physical body as we are now we are separated from one another but it is really this body is the only thing that identifies us to each other because we are bound in five senses see tastes feel smell here and as long as we can see or feel one another why we have evidence that we're here if you're blind and can't see then you can feel one another or hear one another and the Earthly senses declare one another but really frankly we have never seen each other did you know that so let me take this to heart we have never actually seen each other we have seen a physical representation of one another but we have never actually seen one another did you know that we have never seen one another you hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever's on the inside so then when we talk to each other we're really not talking to the body it's the spirit inside but the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the inside and therefore when we speak to each other we quickly can understand right away whether we're Christians or not because there's a fellowship in the spirit that we talk from you see that it vibrates to one another that whether we are Christians or not therefore we have never seen each other that's how Jesus can look at the disciples and say nothing by any means shall hurt you because the you is not this you amen something can hurt this part this part is not me this is a tabernacle I dwell in and this flesh reflects me but the real me is the spirit me on the inside the Son of God the child of God Amen and so we we have a flesh that declares one another but it's not me so no matter what happens to the flesh nothing can hurt me we have to understand this because it becomes so imperative to understand the the protection of God and the promises of God Amen God will deliver this flesh over and over and over again because it's serving his purpose amen because we have to have a life that reflects his life upon this Earth and in order to manifest that light that life we have to have a body to work in and he made promises for us even for healing and physical Deliverance so that we have a body to work out of but this body is not me I am inside of this body amen so what happens to the body I mean can't hurt me and I've I've realized recently that my body doesn't work as well as it used to and brother Benham talked about amen when he when he when he crossed 50 he got up in the morning and he was stiff and had aches and pains and he talked about all of that but but I I used to hear what brother Branham said but I didn't know what he was talking about and then you begin to realize that your body begins to stiffen up involuntarily I don't want it to be stiff it just happens and the body ages and brother bear said we've got to go through some of these things but really on the inside I have never changed amen I'm the same that I've always been I feel the same I think the same I have the same thoughts and desires and amen it's the outside that's changing but the inside is growing more like Christ the outside is deteriorating but the inside is not amen so we need to focus on the part that matters most let's turn to the book of Acts chapter 7. Acts chapter 7 records the first martyr the first Christian martyr which is Steve and a deacon in the in the first church and he preaches a marvelous sermon through Acts chapter 7 when he's called before the Sanhedrin and the elders are questioning him and he takes him all the way through down the history of their nation and Through the Bible and he finally ends with a condemnation to them amen for what they have done in their day and then I want to pick it up in verse 54 chapter 7 verse 54. it says when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of God then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul and they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and he cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep there's several interesting things that I want to point out here first is that he fell asleep Stephen didn't die because Stephen couldn't die it was impossible for him to die amen because he was a child of God he had within him eternal life he could not die but what he could do was fall asleep amen this is why Jesus At The Lazarus death he told his disciples Lazarus sleepeth and they thought if he sleepeth he'd do it well and brother bam said he had to speak in terms they would understand he had to change their language he said Lazarus is dead amen but Lazarus wasn't dead the body Lazarus lived in was dead they understood him to be dead Jesus understood him to be asleep and now Stephen amen being stoned to death amen being stoned to death he could not die he fell asleep but he could not die so when he was in a time of great trouble he saw Jesus because in a time of great trouble Jesus comes and he looked up and and as they were running upon him to to kill him that they were gnashing upon him with their teeth and they were angry and he looked up steadfastly he saw the heavens open and he saw Jesus standing on the right hand of God and and in his time of trouble he saw the Lord amen the Lord appeared unto him but not to everybody else he was the only one amen who caught the vision he was the only one who saw amen what was going on but when they drug him out of the city and began to Stone him amen Stephen it says here in verse 59 and they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus received my spirit and he dealed down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep when it come to a time of trouble for Stephen the Lord appeared but Stephen was the only one who could see the rest couldn't see but when Stephen said Lord lay not this sin to their charge he was manifesting the Lord Jesus that appeared to him he was demonstrating to them or manifesting to them the very same life that was hanging on Calvary just a short time before that said father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing when he was laughed at when he was mocked when his beard was ripped out of his face when he was beaten and hung on a cross and they were walking by mocking him he said Lord forgive them for they don't know what they're doing now his life is in Stephen Stephen in a time of trouble the Lord appears to him but then what he does is he manifests the very presence of Jesus Christ in his flesh by saying father lay not this sin to their charge and they all missed it amen they missed what was going on in their midst he was there manifesting the life of the Lord Jesus Christ and they didn't see it in a time of trouble he was there in a time of trouble he was made manifest in a time of trouble he was on display but they couldn't see who it was that was in Stephen all they could see was the flesh body but he was manifesting the life of Jesus Christ that was Christ in Stephen that was forgiving those people and the message who is this from 1959 the prophet said but there are some who believe on him they were expecting him to come and knowing that something special would be there something was going to take place for Jesus cannot come at any time unless something special does take place there's always something new when he appears and they were charged with expectations but the bad thing about all this there was many who did not see him never to get to see him when he come and that's one of the sad things about today there'll be many who won't see him when he comes but there'll be a Remnant there'll be those who know God and who are waiting and who are charged they'll see him for he will come as a thief in the night we'll be caught up to meet the Lord in the air a secret going away of the church when Jesus come they were there was an expectation that there would be a messiah there was a prophecy laying there they were expecting but when he come many didn't see him some that looked right at him didn't see him some that spoke with him didn't seem talked to him didn't see him saw the Miracles but didn't see him they were looking for a messiah but when he come they missed him but he came he was in their midst he was declaring himself he was doing the works that the father gave him to do he was doing the works that testified of who he was amen they saw amen a form but they didn't see who it was amen they saw Jesus but they didn't know that this was the Messiah they missed him when he came even when they saw him just like they missed him and Stephen when Stephen forgave them man and he says when he comes today many won't see him and that's the case many don't see him although he's present and he declares himself let's go to Matthew chapter 13. Matthew chapter 13. in verse 13. he says therefore I speak unto them in Parables because they sing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiahs which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed us at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear [Music] he was present he had come he was in their midst they had been looking for him but they didn't see him they didn't seem when he come although he came according to the word according to the promise I'll go on time he came but they didn't see him but he said blessed are your eyes because you see in your ears because you're here just because some didn't see didn't mean he didn't come amen and just because some couldn't see that mean others couldn't see some saw some didn't see but it was the same event amen it goes to show that he can come and it be missed in Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 from the Hebrew series Prophet said friends let's go on into perfection we're without excuse today we have no excuse at all the god of Heaven has appeared in these last days and is doing the very same thing that he did when he was here before when he was on Earth he has proved as we're coming through this Bible again he says and when their eyes were opened they knew him he said still you know today after that Jesus has raised from the dead and has appeared to the people in the last days I say again Jesus has appeared amen amen he has appeared in the last days through a prophetic Ministry amen they saw the prophetic Ministry but they didn't see the Lord Jesus Christ they didn't see who it was behind the flash they didn't see who it was during the discernment they didn't see who it was working the Miracles amen they saw they saw the body of flesh but they missed the appearing of Jesus Christ and so it goes to show he can appear and it can be missed he can come and it can be missed go to Revelation chapter one I want to drop this little thought in here of the Prophet I want to bring this in hopefully for clarity I hope it brings clarity Revelation chapter 1 Revelation chapter 1. verse 7. it says behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which Pierce him and all kinds of the Earth shall wail because of him even so amen so this is the coming of the Lord do we all agree [Music] amen he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him they also which pierced him and then in the church age book and the section the revelation of Jesus Christ he reads this scripture and after he refers to that scripture he says he is coming Jesus is coming God is coming the prophet is coming the priest and King is Coming the all in all is coming even so Lord Jesus come quickly amen he is coming he is coming in clouds Clouds Of Glory is when he was seen upon the mount Transfiguration and his garments were shining as the power of God unfolding him and every and in the church age book that every is capitalized e-v-e-r-y all capitalize and every eye shall see him that means this is not the rapture so in the coming for the Rapture not everybody will see him he will come but many will miss him but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear he will come for the Rapture of the church but not every eye will see him this is a different coming of the Lord amen so every time you hear the coming of the lord it's not the same coming amen and every eye shall see him that means this is not the Rapture this is when he comes to take over his rightful places World ruler this is when those who have pierced him with their Creeds and denominational Doctrine shall mourn and all the people shall wail and Terror because of him who is the word so he when he comes that time every eye shall see him but that's not the rapture when he comes for the rapture only a few he will come but only a few will see him in the message God has provided away from 1962 he said now remember these two words before I leave you the appearing of Christ in the coming of Christ it's two different things Christ is now appearing in the fullness of his power his coming will be afterwards his appearing before his coming God be merciful and brother M said his ministry was the he said Jesus Christ is appearing in the fullness of his power you believe he was appearing how many people saw Jesus I did amen I did some people saw a man from Kentucky with a seventh grade education about five foot six and wearing a certain colored suit and standing a certain way amen but there are some who saw beyond that and saw Jesus Christ it was the appearing of the Lord it was the appearing of Jesus Christ and brother rep said there was appearing before the coming this is so interesting to me when he comes to proving his word now we've read this so many times but it it's worth repeating so as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church he know no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church through the head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unite together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman do you see what I mean it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper see amen she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage he goes on to say when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing so interesting that brother man types so much his ministry was the appearing of Jesus Christ but we know that the coming of the Lord was the coming of the word was the coming of the Capstone The Headstone coming to unite with the bride and then the ministry of the appearing amen was the revealing of the son of man and it was the coming of the son of man coming to what to unite with the bride amen and he's coming to come he's coming to Oneness with his bride amen so that the coming will be manifest in the bride nine amen amen praise be to God and who will see it multitudes will see the manifestation of it but who will recognize who's here and the message who is this Melchizedek the prophet says in being that I've told you all these things all these nights and tonight that he is not dead he is here and promised to do the same thing and promise that there would come a time and the last days according to Malachi 4 and according to Saint Luke that he would appear again in human form among his people and do the same things and reveal the same things the same Messianic sign hey the world was in a time of trouble when the prophet of God here it was in religious trouble amen it was the darkest that it's ever been amen and in the time of trouble Jesus Christ appeared amen he appeared in profit form amen he appeared and Son of Man form amen and that was a forerunner to his coming amen amen and just because multitudes didn't see it doesn't mean it didn't happen and he was forerunning the coming I want to go back and I want to read uh Matthew 28. let's go back and read a couple scriptures here Matthew and then we'll look in John Matthew 28. Matthew 28 and verse 18. after his death Barrel in his resurrection and begins to speak to the disciples here in this final words in the Book of Matthew he said and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go you therefore and teach All Nations baptizing in them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you all we even unto the end of the world he promised to be with the disciples to the end of the world to the consummation of the ages let's go to Luke 14. I'm sorry let's go to John 14. not Luke John chapter 14. and I want to start reading it verse 15. John 14 and verse 15. if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter then he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so Jesus is telling them you'll the world won't know him but you'll know him right now he's dwelling with you but then he'll be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you so Jesus just said there's going to be another comforter come to you amen he he is the one that's with you and will be in you and I will not leave you comfortless he and he's saying I'm going to send you a comforter I'll pray to the father he'll send you a comforter he says I won't leave you comfortless I will come to you he's saying that I'm the comforter amen I will come in you amen I will be in you amen you're going to receive another comforter the spirit of truth that dwells with you will be in you I will leave you comfortless I will come unto you amen and and you begin to realize that that we have to see beyond carnal Beyond flesh amen because it's not that flesh body that was nailed to a cross it's not the one whose vocal cords was saying the words but it was the spirit on the inside that was speaking the word who was the comforter it was the spirit and Life of Christ that was going to come into them he goes on to say yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also the world won't see me but you'll see me but they're not going to see him with these physical eyes and they're not going to see the form that's speaking to them now but they will just assuredly see him praise God amen let's read that again verse 19. yet a little while in the world sees me no more but ye see me because I live ye live also at that day you shall know that I am my father and ye and me and I in you making them all one that's what the prophet goes on to say he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him that means I'll show myself to him so he'll see me Judah saith unto him not not a scary Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come into him and make our Abode with him how many people are going to live in this person that keeps God's Commandments amen three or one is there going to be the comforter or is it going to be Jesus or is it going to be the father amen and the answer is yes amen make our boat with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the father would sent me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things into your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth giveth I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid why don't we have to be afraid because he's promised to be with us and we know that this promise came into fulfillment on the day of Pentecost amen when the pillar of fire returned back and split itself in the licks of fire showing that the spirit of Christ was entering into the church but we know as they went into the first church age amen that now there was a deviation from the word or a leaving from the word amen and the prophet of God tells us that that that the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for nearly 2 000 years amen so he was bound he wasn't at Liberty to live and fullness in the church amen because of the deviation and separation from the word amen you separate from the word you separate from Christ right but it's to be loose the Holy Ghost loosed in the evening time amen by the evening time message the Holy Ghost back in the people again which is what Jesus Christ returning back to his body which is his bride amen not in partial measure now through the churches but in fullness he's come amen and it's him the comforter it's him Jesus Christ it's him the father and the son making their Abode in you amen all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church and what was limited and bound has been loosed by the evening time message to come back into the church again amen the the the the the son of man was revealed amen Jesus Christ appeared through a prophetic Ministry to bring the word back to the Forefront to bring Christ back on the scene to make the word so real that it'll literally unite The Head and the body together amen so that now he is here present in his body in full measure he has come but where is he he's in her praise God amen just like when he was here in Jesus Christ form they saw him and they didn't see him they looked for him they expected his coming that anticipations their thoughts and ideas he came he went they missed it he was present they didn't see it but there were some who saw and in this day he's come and multitudes have missed it and are missing it but there's some who have eyes to see and ears to hear amen there are some that have had their eyes open and they can see him and they can see him where he is and they can see him in the form that he's in it's always the form that throws him off it's always the form that brings confusion amen but it's him just the same amen when they were walking with Jesus Christ on the road to Emmaus he the scripture says he appeared to two others in another form he was in another form their eyes were withhold and they couldn't tell who it was but it was the very same one amen it was the same person it was Jesus Christ began to speak to them and discern and share the scriptures with them amen until he broke the bread a certain way and their eyes were open they knew who it was and he was in another form and they couldn't tell who it was but it was the same one he was there amen praise be to God and when the Jesus broke the bread it didn't open their physical eyes it opened their spiritual eyes and they could discern who it was when he returned amen when he resurrected amen and Mary was in the in the garden looking for him Mary's looking for him amen where have you laid him she's looking for a dead corpse she's looking for the one that was nailed to the cross amen and here he is standing alive amen resurrected alive but she assumes he's the gardener Mary knew what he looked like amen Mary had been with him she had served him she had talked to him amen she knew what he looked like so he's standing here in another form in the form of the gardener because he is the gardener amen and he is the seed and he is the fruit and he's standing as the gardener amen and and she doesn't know who she's talking to she's asking the gardener where Jesus is and the gardener is Jesus [Music] where is Jesus he is Jesus but he looks like a gardener and she assumes he's the gardener she thinks she's talking to a gardener and she's talking to Jesus Christ some people that think they're talking to church members they're talking to people who believe a message but they don't know what's behind those people they don't know what this word is this word that we're giving is Jesus Christ it is him he is the word she said please sir tell me where you've laid him and I'll go get him and he said Mary when he called her by name she knew who it was she said rabboni Master amen and fell at his feet amen when he called your name all of a sudden you knew who this was that was speaking to you who's present who's here who was in that prophet and who's in The Bride amen amen just because multiples the multitudes don't seem doesn't mean he's not here when everyone sees him that's not the fearing that we're looking for that's not the coming and that is exciting to us amen although that'll be exciting amen because we return with him but the one that's exciting to us is the one that's going on now when he's coming and taking us in a Rapture and catching us away word by word by word until finally we make the final translation praise be to God that's the one we see do you see it do you have eyes to see who it is praise be to God brother Benham said in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said as the end time prophecies will repeat I believe as the first Forerunner came from the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of God the second Forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride what's that Forerunner pointing the people to he's pointing the people to a word born bride and the bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of Jesus screaming Behold the Lamb of God will come forth from his lips so while the prophet is here he must introduce the bride to Christ he must point out the appearing of Jesus Christ and declare who it is that God help us to be ready for this near event I better leave it from right right here do you believe why has this been have have you a better understanding now it's it's the word friends this has been about six hours right close to five and a half or six hours there is much more could be said but surely the Holy Spirit Will by this time has sunk it so deep in you that you know what I'm talking about we're at the end time the seeds are sown now the latter rain is fixing to come forth has the latter rain come absolutely friends amen it's come remember there will be such a denominational Gathering pretty soon it'll be terrific and they will bring themselves together into this Federation of churches and when this kind of church will be put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus will appear and he will show witch's bride and which is not sometimes I wonder how it will appear in what form he's come what form has he come in now when he appears where will he appear maybe in Bride for him and the message turned on the light from 1964 and from the ripening of the grain from all the way back from Luther all the way down through the age it ought to be the fullness of the Gospel now the power of God to ripen the light that's been shown through justification sanctification the Pentecostal age ought to ripen the bride tree for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that Christ could be manifest in his church as one person him and his wife him and his bride this is the hour We're living this is the light of the day so what will ripen the bride tree for the coming of the Lord what's the coming of the Lord that Christ could be manifested in his church as one person him and his bride together as one person where is he he's in his bride what did he come to he came to his bride what did he Unite with the body his bride where did he come to the bride in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says but you remember when it went down and the grain began to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stalk has to be dead Hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus in Bride form same power same church same thing same word where is he amen they don't see the form but he's there amen just as much as he was walking on the road to Emmaus with with cleopius and his friend he is here just the same only in a form and their eyes are withholden to the form but I prayed God that he will break the bread to you amen that he will break the bread with his own hands and do something in a certain way that you'll say that's him amen that's not people that's not a church that's not a group of people believing something that is Jesus Christ in Bride form amen that's where he's at praise God and the laodicean church age from the church age book I'm going to read a couple quotes out of that little little flock do not fear why won't you fear why shouldn't we fear because he is our help in a time of trouble in times of great trouble he comes he makes his appearance Amen in times of great need in times of great trouble how many times in our lives amen did we wonder where God was where are you Lord where are you Lord where are you Lord and you come down to the wire and when you come to the wire he shows up just on time in times of great trouble he makes his appearance amen he declares his presence he shows I've been with you all along [Music] praise be to God it's no different for in our lives there's no different and and the great economy of God in times of great trouble he comes he makes his appearance he declares his presence he says oh little flock do not fear this age is fast closing as it does those tears will be bound together and as the threefold court is not easily broken they will have tremendous threefold strength of political physical spiritual satanical power and they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure fear not those things that are coming upon the Earth for he who loved his own loved them unto the end John 13 1. no matter what it looks like don't be afraid no matter what troubles come amen there's so many things that the prophet has told us so many things that he's declared but even in the Declaration of the prophecy we don't know what it's going to look like we don't know how things will exactly happen how rough how difficult not difficult I I don't know what it was going to look like but no matter what looks like don't be afraid he is here and in times of great trouble he comes and He makes himself known amen he will appear how will he appear amen he will appear in his form Amen in Bride form that's my personal belief in the in the church age again he says this layout of cnh ends in a blackout of the word thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus she will have a deliverer on the inside she will have a help and a time of trouble inside she will have the Strong Tower that she's run into will be in her the shield and buckler will be in her the lifter of her head will be in her amen the all-sufficient one will be in her no matter what she faces don't be afraid don't worry amen there's an ability inside the bride to do a short powerful demonstration amen whatever's needed at the time he'll do amen remember brother Ben I'm talking about the manifestation of the third pool we know the third pull is the word amen and but there's a manifestation to the third boy he talks about speaking squirrels into existence speaking to his wife's tomb or amen speaking to Hattie's rights boys and and speaking to the storm in Colorado when you think about those things all of those were in a time of need amen and in the time of need the brother Branham never once said God I want to create squirrels God I want to speak to the Salvation how do you write this book he never said that it was God that told him to speak he was the mouthpiece for the God that was on the inside and if you go back and read every one of those accounts brother Branham never said I created squirrels never never never said I created squirrels he never said I moved the storm back he never said I removed my wife's tumor he always says God did that amen that was God that was not a man or the effort of the man it was God that was inside the man the Strong Tower was in the flesh body and he had to wait for the one on the inside to tell him what to do and when he did it the one on the inside performed it amen it wasn't the flesh body of William Branham it was the life of Jesus Christ in that body mother Benham you'll never hear him say I created his cross he didn't create squirrels Jesus Christ created squirrels but he used him to do it and he had somebody in obedience and subjection to him that he could trust to say the right thing at the right time what's he training you and I for to get some people that he can trust amen that will obey him and wait for him and then when given permission we'll say the right thing at the right time but then when you go back and look at those five accounts absolute Dynamic accounts of the spoken word power in uh in a hybrid body and a redeemed human being absolute Supernatural power that was manifest through a body of Flesh that was sin born and what newspaper carried the coverage what news agency did a report on it some of the most powerful demonstrations in a human being that was not virgin born and who knows it about it outside the message you see God can do powerful Dynamic wonderful things to his bride and it doesn't mean the whole world would know about it he does it for you he does it in a time of need he does it when you when you there's a need the strong Towers on the inside the help in a time of trouble he will appear Amen in his body and do whatever he needs to do he just needs somebody he will yield to the one on the inside amen somebody who will yield to the to the one in the control tower amen not using our own minds not playing games amen with the manifestation of the third pool not using our own thinking not thinking it'll be this and it'll be that and I'll say this and I'll do that you'll do nothing amen because it won't be you it'll be him in you if anything ever happens whatever it is little or a non in Psalm and not all and every I don't know what's going to happen but whatever happens it will not be you and I it'll be him and you and I it'll be Jesus Christ in the form of his bride foreign it'll be his ministry his power not hers what's he need friends he needs a yielded vessel he needs a surrendered heart he needs somebody that won't compromise on the word like Eve did he needs somebody that won't get ahead of the program like he did he needs somebody that'll wait he had it in the prophet of God Amen and through how many afflictions and trials and ups and downs and tests that he did he shape and mold that prophet to get him to that place where he could trust him to say whatever you say is what it'll be amen praise be to God let's go to Psalms 46. Psalms 46. 46 and 7 verse 7. the Lord of hosts is with us do you believe it do you believe it more than you've ever believed it amen this isn't a type this is reality amen this isn't a neat phrase this has to be the living reality of our day the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge come Behold The Works of the Lord what desolations he hath made in the earth he make of the wars to cease into the end of the Earth he breakth the bow and cut at the spear and thunder he burnt The Chariot in in the fire be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge amen amen don't be afraid there's nothing to be afraid of you get backed into a corner there's a power that's already been demonstrated that can free the children of God from any obstacle whether it be nature whether it be need whether it be salvation amen whether it be a great tumor amen it's already been demonstrated in the hour of great need that Jesus Christ can appear amen praise the Lord in the Legacy in church age he says the wheat and the tares which from the first age until now have grown side by side are harvested when I see us set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of the organization the false Church turns from any Vestige of Truth and with political might reinforces herself with State backing and sets out to eradicate Forever The True Believer but just when she is about to accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat is gathered into the garden what do we have to be afraid of it doesn't matter what law we see past there's no point in getting up in political arms about anything these things have to happen let them happen don't get your political hat on and go out and put a banner in your yard don't do that just keep pressing on in the word amen keep living the life of Christ don't get distracted by the arguments of the world it's got to go a certain way it'll go that way and no matter what happens Let It Go brother bear said the world is falling apart let it fall apart amen America is finished don't try to restore it it's done amen amen he says just when she's about to accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat is gathered into the Garner no longer of the wheat and tears grow side by side no longer will The tares receive of the blessings of God because of the presence of the wheat for the wheat will be gone and the wrath of God will be poured out in the Sixth Seal which will end in the utter destruction of the wicked you won't be here for that if you're a child of God you're part of his bride there's nothing to be afraid of there's nothing to worry about amen no matter how close it gets we've got a promise it won't get so close that he won't rescue you and I we don't know what will happen I I don't want to get ahead of God's program I don't want to presume that I even know I have no idea all I know is what the prophet said and I believe what he said to be true how it plays out I don't know but one thing I know for sure is the same God that was with that Prophet is with his bride amen the same son of man that was in a son of man amen is continuing in the bride form amen and he can do whatever he needs to do in the time that he needs to do it amen and all we have to do is keep quiet keep serving God stick with the word and when there's a great time of need and great times of need Jesus comes amen he'll appear he'll make his presence known he'll show which is bright and which is not how I don't know I've got my own ideas but my ideas are worthless but it'll happen and when it happens we'll see and we'll see everything the prophet said was true and all we have to do is have faith and believe and trust and Hold Steady and not panic and not be afraid and not run around like crazy and not try to save ourselves and not get into a bunch of finagling and just hold steady stand still and recognize that he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world and believe it with all your heart that the god of the ages is present amen that Jesus Christ who overcame death and hell is standing with you now is in you living his life through the bride let's finish with Psalms 27. which is the scripture brother Branham opened the Rapture with Psalms 27. verse 1. Psalm 27 and 1. the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear listen I don't care what the news says I don't care what your neighbors say I don't care what you see going on around you this is still the truth [Music] amen the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid I'll tell you why this is true because this flesh is not me and nothing no weapon formed against me shall prosper because all men made weapons they only can touch the flesh but they can't touch me man don't fear him that can kill the body but fear him that can destroy the soul amen but there's it doesn't matter what you do to my body you cannot hurt me amen because nothing by any means shall hurt you no weapon formed against me shall prosper you can shoot me but you have not destroyed me amen you can shoot me but you have not hurt me amen because me will live on Amen remember Peter when Peter comes to the end of his ministry he said the time of my departure is at hand he didn't say the time of my death because Peter wasn't going to die he was going to lay down the robe of Flesh and he was going to move on with the same life that was in him was going to continue on somewhere else so he said the time of my departure is at hand amen he said as the Lord has shown me he knew and he wasn't grieving over it he wasn't scared about it he wasn't upset and his departure wasn't an easy departure he was hung upside down on the cross but it didn't hurt Peter any amen if you asked Peter today if it hurt him he'll say no it didn't hurt me because he's got the same life he had when he was in this body he's living somewhere else Paul the Apostle in second Timothy says the time of my departure is at hand I'm sorry Peter says shortly Peter Peter won a First Peter 1 14. shortly I must put off this Tabernacle oh what language what Revelation what understanding shortly I must put off this Tabernacle hey I tell you what you may think it's a morbid thought but I crossed 45 and when I crossed 45 I said hey at least I'm probably halfway done done do you may sound morbid but this isn't the life I'm living for I'm here serving my purpose serving my king fulfilling the purpose he has for me but my life when this robe is dropped my life will continue on Amen I I I'm not going to die I cannot perish I cannot be hurt by anything man has made no scheme of man no plot of man no weapon of man nothing can hurt me it couldn't hurt Peter amen Paul was beheaded all it was was his departure yeah Peter was hung upside down on a cross all it was was dropping the robe of flashing he changed Tabernacles so many people want to upgrade houses when the housing market started taking off everybody went sell and upgrade sell and upgrade I'm telling you we got the best upgrade policy in the world all we got to do is drop this robe and go to another one we've got the best the best upgrade amen and and I'm not looking to stay in this pest house when my time to upgrade comes so I'm not afraid of the upgrade whatever method it comes by amen the devil he controls Us by fear amen so much fear in the world and so much fear of what will happen in fear of situations and fear of pain amen if we could just lose the fear the devil would lose so much control over us if we weren't afraid of what people thought if we weren't afraid of the consequences for following the word if we weren't afraid of persecution if we weren't afraid of Shame if we weren't afraid of if we weren't afraid the devil would lose so much control over you and I God help us to stand with your word and believe it give us a greater Faith to believe it the way David believed it David believed in the natural I believe it in the spiritual let's keep reading Psalms 27. the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should have Camp against me my heart shall not fear they closed the doors to the church rejoice they only think they stopped the church the building's not the church they can't stop the church by closing the doors though a host of the camping gives me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise up against me and this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord if the time of trouble equals going into the secret of his Pavilion then we should welcome the time of trouble if it's in a great time of trouble he comes we should welcome a great time of trouble when he appears in times of great need when he shows his right hand of power in times that there's great need then we shouldn't be so afraid of the times of great need we should just accept what comes and trusts that this is going to be a fantastic manifestation of the power of God this is going to be God doing something again I don't know how he'll do it I don't know what he'll do I can't dictate what he'll do but I'm standing with the word and believing I'm getting ready to see God move on the scene let's turn if we could turn fear into expectation if we could just get a hold of the emotional side and push the fear away and change the fear to to joyful expectation and saying I don't know how he'll figure this one out but I can't wait to see what he does now there's so many potentials possibilities difficult circumstances and situations there's so much potential out there for fearful situations so much that can go wrong so much in the attitudes of the people that can change overnight so much in the world structure that that can become tumultuous and unstable there's so much to be afraid of but there's more to give us faith there's more promises in the word there's more manifestations there's more evidence as we've seen more Amen in the manifestation of a son of man uh the son of man through a son of man than anything the world can throw at us to know that it's all going to be okay no matter what happens there is a power that is with us there is a presence a person that is in the bride that can solve all problems that can provide all needs and all he needs is a willing vessel and he may need your vocal cords but if he uses your vocal cords amen then praise God when he ordains and when he instructs and he uses your vocal course then he will do what he's promised to do just trust him believe him and be excited we've seen him appear he's come now times of trouble he'll appear again in his bride to show that who was bride and who was not I say it's in it it's going to be an exciting time may God build us in faith may God help us to shed all the natural and give us more revelation of his word to build more of that perfect faith so that we can hold steady in the time of trouble and watch God deliver and let's all stand musicians of your common brother Ben if you'll make your way up I'll tell you God is so good what we have seen what we have recorded the testimonies the sermons The Doctors reports the things that we have seen in the ministry of the prophet and the things that we have seen in our lives yes the things that take place week after week all around us amen we should be coming to a place where we stop panicking every time circumstances go sideways we should start looking for God to come on the scene we should start looking for his appearing any moment because when in times of great trouble he appears amen he comes there's something getting ready to happen and when we see things going sideways and going wrong that's when we start saying something's on the Move something's happening amen something's getting ready to shift amen hold on here comes another testimony he's going to prove himself again the same yeah man we've seen it in the prophet to build us our faith but it's happening in our lives all the time testimony upon testimony upon testimony he is present he is here the the god of the ages is with us amen the god of Jacob is with us the god of Abraham is with us the god of Isaac is with us we don't have to go find him in a time of need he's present amen we don't have to run somewhere he's here there's no place to panic there's no place to look there's no place to run to amen he is on the inside and he will solve all problems amen I always get ashamed of myself when I get in trouble and I start darting around and looking for Solutions and talking to people say God forgive me my help is the word that's living inside of me my helper is the person who's present he's here the creator of heavens and earth is here the one who's spoken into existence he's here the word amen that sustains everything and holds everything in place is here he's present in the form of his bride God help us to rest in that and have faith God God grant us more of your faith is all I can say amen this bow our heads and pray oh Lord Jesus we thank you God for the tremendous word that you have given to us God what a day we live in there's never been a day like this day there's never been a time lord we there's nobody who's seen what we have seen and heard what we have heard oh God we're so thankful for eyes to see and ears to hear but I pray that you would Quicken this to a reality in our lives God help us to overcome the flesh and all the things of the Flesh and the desires
