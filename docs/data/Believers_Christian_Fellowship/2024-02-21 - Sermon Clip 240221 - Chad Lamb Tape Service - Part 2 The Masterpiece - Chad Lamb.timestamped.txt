[0:00] brother Benham he'll take an analogy and
[0:01] he just keeps breaking it down and using
[0:03] it in so many different ways he said
[0:06] Jesus Christ was the other half of the
[0:08] laundry ticket to the word to the
[0:11] promises so he when he fulfilled all the
[0:13] promises then he come to complete the
[0:16] word and the promises and when that
[0:17] connected back together that unlocked
[0:19] Redemption for you and
[0:20] I then he showed that out of him came
[0:24] the bride and now when they come back
[0:26] together when those two halv it's the
[0:27] completion of redemption to go back to
[0:29] Eden
[0:30] so he just keeps break he keeps working
[0:32] an analogy over and over so you don't
[0:34] stop and you're thinking it's only this
[0:36] am me he keeps using it but then he's
[0:37] going to take this analogy now of the
[0:40] diamond and The Cutting of a diamond
[0:43] because the diamond doesn't shine light
[0:44] until it cuts and he's going to show
[0:46] that we have to be cut by what by the
[0:48] word because only the right kind of tool
[0:50] can cut the diamond and so it reflects
[0:52] the light but then he's also going to
[0:54] use Christ the word is the diamond and
[0:56] the piece cut off what's the purpose of
[0:58] that and I thought this was interesting
[1:00] 105 the Masterpiece must be cut cut for
[1:03] what it's the piece cut off no the piece
[1:06] that's cut off is made of victrola
[1:09] needle now hold on stop here there's
[1:12] young people amongst
[1:13] us I got to stop for just a
[1:16] minute you may have been in a museum
[1:19] sometime and seen a vinyl
[1:23] record and they used to take this
[1:25] plastic vinyl record and they cut
[1:27] grooves in it and you'd put a little on
[1:29] a little plate and that plate had a
[1:31] motor and it would Spin and you would
[1:33] take a little needle and put a needle
[1:35] down and as that needle moved on those
[1:37] grooves it reproduced sound out of a
[1:39] speaker that's how we actually used to
[1:41] have music and stuff a long time
[1:43] ago I know it's blowing your mind now
[1:46] but we didn't have anything digital
[1:49] right but that little needle and
[1:52] originally they would use a piece of
[1:54] diamond on that that little victrola
[1:56] needle now listen to what he said that
[1:58] piece that's cut off it's made of a
[1:59] victrola needle and the victrola needle
[2:02] is put upon a record that's unseen music
[2:05] to the world but the needle is what
[2:07] brings it out brings out the true
[2:10] interpretation of the word do you
[2:13] believe you're a piece that's smitten
[2:14] off the great Diamond then what are we
[2:16] supposed to be doing we're supposed to
[2:18] be following the rhythm of the word and
[2:22] reproducing the word and
[2:26] manifestation amen this is the word this
[2:29] is the record that that has the grooves
[2:31] cut in it and nobody can read that and
[2:34] understand what it is you can look at
[2:35] all the grooves on a vinyl record and
[2:37] you can't make the music it's going to
[2:39] take the needle to replicate the sound
[2:41] amen and that's what all the pieces that
[2:44] are smitten off of that great Diamond
[2:47] we're here to be those needles that
[2:49] reproduce the what the true
[2:51] interpretation of the word what does it
[2:53] mean to be a church what does it mean to
[2:55] be modest what does it mean to be holy
[2:57] what does it mean to submit to the
[2:59] headship of the word what does it mean
[3:00] that's what we're here to play that
[3:04] record praise God oh I love that
