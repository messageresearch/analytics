[6:24] praise god so thankful for that amen
[6:29] that god has already determined who i am
[6:33] who i am in him and what i'll do and
[6:36] what he'll accomplish to this vessel and
[6:38] i thank god for that
[6:40] and while we're standing let's turn to
[6:41] jeremiah 29.
[6:45] begin reading from there as you turn
[6:49] there
[6:49] i just want to thank everybody who was
[6:52] praying and those who were able to
[6:53] attend the funeral yesterday
[6:55] for brother steve smart's father eugene
[6:57] smart
[6:59] and then we had a nice funeral
[7:02] many of the people that were gathered i
[7:03] didn't know they were strangers to me
[7:05] and i had never had the opportunity to
[7:07] meet steve's father before
[7:11] but as steve sat down and began to share
[7:12] his testimony and share that he was a
[7:14] believer in the message and
[7:16] he was the one who led steve to the
[7:18] message and i
[7:20] you know it's got that familiar feeling
[7:22] to it you know that same testimony that
[7:24] we have
[7:25] and brother steve told me he said i want
[7:26] the message preached at my dad's funeral
[7:29] i said praise god i can do that and so
[7:32] by the grace of god that's what he
[7:33] allowed us to do is we just preached the
[7:35] message we just preached what gene
[7:37] believed
[7:38] to his family and to his friends and and
[7:43] i just talked to him very straight about
[7:45] what the message is what gene believed
[7:46] why there was a need for a message why
[7:48] god sent a prophet
[7:49] who that prophet was and what was
[7:51] accomplished by that prophet coming
[7:53] and they listened very intentively and
[7:56] in
[7:57] um i received quite a bit of feedback
[7:59] from several of the individuals that
[8:01] were here folks i never met before but
[8:02] family members
[8:03] shook my hand and said that was powerful
[8:05] i appreciate what you said thank you for
[8:07] that
[8:08] and then as they left i invited them to
[8:11] take a church ages book if they wanted
[8:12] to know better what gene believed i'd
[8:14] set
[8:15] seven church age books out on the
[8:16] welcome desk and invite them to take the
[8:18] booklets that were back on the wall
[8:20] and by the time i walked out here all
[8:22] the church age books were gone
[8:24] and several of the individual booklets
[8:26] were gone
[8:27] and then one of the ladies that were
[8:29] here uh met my wife
[8:31] and and the voyeur and she had a stack
[8:34] of three or four or five
[8:35] message books that she had gotten out of
[8:37] the rack and she was telling angie
[8:40] how wonderful the service was and how
[8:42] much you appreciate what was said
[8:44] and i said you never know what god's
[8:46] going to do or what form matter what
[8:47] setting he's going to use and
[8:49] i just ask that you'd be praying for
[8:51] brother steve that god will give him
[8:52] wisdom
[8:53] that is his family would have questions
[8:55] that god can use him as a tool
[8:57] to lead them to christ and that the
[8:59] things that were said that wouldn't fade
[9:00] away from their heart but god would
[9:03] pierce to the heart
[9:04] there's a seed laying there that it
[9:05] would quicken to life
[9:07] amen so i appreciate those who are
[9:09] praying those who are able to come and
[9:10] support
[9:11] and pray that ask that you continue to
[9:13] pray and those are things we long for
[9:16] opportunities to tell somebody the
[9:19] message of the hour
[9:20] the way of escaping this day how to find
[9:23] the ark of safety
[9:24] these are things that we love to talk
[9:26] about and every time you have a set of
[9:28] fresh ears it's so much fun
[9:31] to tell somebody the truth amen
[9:34] what we know amen and i think sometimes
[9:36] we get
[9:38] bogged down because we've had such
[9:40] rejection
[9:41] if you've been in the message and shared
[9:42] the message very much you've had
[9:44] rejection amen
[9:45] and we've met with rejection but but you
[9:48] know if you're rejected 50 times
[9:50] but find that one it's worth it amen
[9:53] and most all of us are here because
[9:56] somebody told us the truth
[9:58] amen and we thank god for that and so
[10:01] just continue to pray for that and
[10:02] we just ask god to have his way i also
[10:05] want to say hi to matthew
[10:06] god bless you matthew mcgeary and
[10:08] gabriella and their family they're here
[10:09] visiting
[10:10] it's good to have you hopefully i get a
[10:12] chance to shake your hand before you
[10:13] leave brother
[10:14] amen let's look at jeremiah 29
[10:18] and verse 13
[10:26] and you shall seek me and find me
[10:29] when you shall search for me with all
[10:31] your hearts
[10:33] not a half-hearted search but with all
[10:36] your heart
[10:37] you shall seek me and you shall find me
[10:40] when you search for me
[10:41] with all your heart let's bow our heads

[11:10] glory bless our brother steve lord as he

[11:18] that you give him wisdom lord
[11:20] if it would be any in the family that

[11:23] inspiration from you on how to answer

[11:27] to minister to those needs god as we

[13:29] so if you want to sing a song of
[13:31] thanksgiving you have something on your
[13:32] heart

[13:38] and they'll start
[13:40] putting that together i just now said
[13:42] that so i might have to talk to them
[13:44] and come up with a better plan but you
[13:46] can talk to them anyways they'll come up
[13:47] with a plan those are good fellas amen
[13:50] amen so so this morning
[13:53] i want to talk about wrestle with and
[13:56] overcome for just a little bit
[13:58] and i you know god has laid this on my
[14:00] heart and i just want to share it
[14:03] uh maybe just take my time not a long
[14:05] time but just to share from my heart
[14:08] and i really want to talk to to to the
[14:11] young people really
[14:12] the young people and the teenagers but
[14:14] it's for all of us
[14:16] but that's kind of a target for me uh
[14:19] this morning if you will the way god's
[14:20] laid it on my heart
[14:22] i want to look at revelations 5 together
[14:24] if we could turn to revelations 5.
[14:34] revelations 5
[14:39] and verse 5.
[14:46] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[14:48] not behold the lion of the tribe of
[14:50] judah
[14:50] the root of david hath prevailed to open
[14:53] the book
[14:54] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[14:56] i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[14:57] throne and the four beasts and in the
[14:59] midst of the elders
[15:00] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[15:03] seven horns and seven
[15:04] eyes which are the seven spirits of god
[15:07] sent forth
[15:08] unto all the earth i'd like to read a
[15:11] quote out of the breach
[15:13] what brother branham says and john
[15:15] started crying he's referring to here to
[15:17] revelation chapter 5 and john started
[15:19] crying
[15:20] because no one was worthy and no one
[15:23] could even look at the book oh
[15:24] it took a human being john wet because
[15:27] no one could do it and
[15:28] everything was lost and there came a
[15:31] voice from one of the elders standing in
[15:32] the midst of the four beasts and
[15:34] all that great host of heaven said don't
[15:36] weep john
[15:37] oh my the grace of god don't be
[15:39] brokenhearted john don't weep for the
[15:41] lion of the tribe of judah the root of
[15:43] an offspring from david hath prevailed
[15:46] prevail means wrestle with and overcome
[15:50] that's where i get the title this
[15:51] morning wrestle with and overcome and
[15:54] i want to talk about that he has
[15:55] prevailed prevail means wrestle with and
[15:58] overcome oh my
[15:59] in the garden of gethsemane when his
[16:01] blood dropped down out of his face
[16:03] he was overcoming the lion or the root
[16:07] of david was prevailed
[16:08] has prevailed and has overcome like
[16:11] jacob being a supplanter and when he got
[16:13] in contact with an angel he held on
[16:15] and the angel tried to pull away he said
[16:17] i'm just not going to let you go he held
[16:20] on until he got what he wanted
[16:21] he wanted and his name was changed from
[16:23] sir planter which means deceiver to what
[16:26] to a prince with god israel he prevailed
[16:29] amen
[16:30] so he got a name change amen when he
[16:33] prevailed his name was changed
[16:35] and and we look back at revelation and
[16:37] john is weeping because he knows if
[16:39] there's nobody that can take this and
[16:41] and i i'm trying my best just to share
[16:43] from my heart with young people so pay
[16:45] close attention to me
[16:46] amen and and i'm going to try to bring
[16:49] it as simple from my heart as i
[16:50] understand it
[16:52] not that you need it simple you guys are
[16:53] smarter than me but
[16:55] i just want to share something real
[16:56] direct with you
[16:59] he was he had prevailed he wrestled with
[17:02] and overcame and when you look the call
[17:06] was for a lion we've talked about this
[17:08] before the call was
[17:09] that there's a lion there's now a lion
[17:11] the lion hath prevailed and when he
[17:13] looked he saw
[17:14] a lamb as it had been slain he saw a
[17:17] bleeding
[17:18] bloody lamb beat up and bruised and this
[17:21] was the lamb that had been mocked and
[17:22] ridiculed and rejected
[17:24] and bruised and what was he he was the
[17:26] one that prevailed
[17:29] and so many times that we get the wrong
[17:31] idea when we read these terms and we
[17:33] think
[17:34] that the line of the tribe of judah has
[17:36] prevailed like he went down there with
[17:38] a mighty force and mighty strength and
[17:40] he wiped them all out and he killed them
[17:42] all
[17:42] but the way he prevailed was submitting
[17:44] to the will of the father
[17:46] and becoming a lamb and surrendering
[17:49] himself completely to the will of god
[17:52] and allowing that will of god and the
[17:54] spirit of god to lead him in ways
[17:57] amen that was contrary to a natural mind
[18:00] and the desire of natural flesh
[18:03] the natural mind the natural heart
[18:05] always wants to protect himself
[18:07] avoid danger keep from trouble amen
[18:10] avoid rejection don't say anything that
[18:12] would be contrary and cause
[18:14] a conflict you know that's the human
[18:17] nature that's the natural way
[18:18] amen but as a lamb he surrendered his
[18:21] rights like a lamb does
[18:22] to his father amen in that surrender
[18:25] he was overcoming he was overcoming for
[18:28] you and i
[18:29] he was overcoming everything that had
[18:32] gone wrong in the garden of eden the
[18:33] fall of mankind
[18:34] he was overcoming not as a mighty
[18:37] a mighty force that would go in and just
[18:41] speak and slay he was overcoming as a
[18:44] lamb
[18:48] and in the garden of gethsemane when
[18:50] blood dropped down out of his face
[18:53] he was overcoming you realize uh
[18:57] when he was in the uh wilderness you
[19:00] know he had
[19:00] been baptized at jordan and the holy
[19:02] ghost of the dove descended and rested
[19:04] upon him and the holy ghost led him in
[19:06] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[19:07] devil
[19:09] and in that temptation he overcame the
[19:12] temptation
[19:13] but but in that temptation he overcame
[19:15] but in that overcoming
[19:17] brother man said he didn't use any of
[19:19] his great powers though he possessed
[19:21] all powers all gifts he had the ability
[19:24] to turn water into wine he had the
[19:26] ability
[19:27] to curse a fig tree to die he had the
[19:29] ability to speak
[19:31] to the lame and they would walk he had
[19:32] the ability to heal all manner of seizes
[19:34] cast out all demons
[19:35] but he used none of his power he was
[19:38] overcoming
[19:39] the temptation in the wilderness without
[19:41] power
[19:42] he was overcoming by the word
[19:46] and brother brahm said he was making it
[19:47] he was putting it where the simplest and
[19:50] the humblest of christians can take it
[19:51] and follow after him
[19:53] he was putting it within reach of you
[19:55] and i he was putting it in reach
[19:57] of an 11 year old a 12 year old a 15
[20:00] year old a 50 year old a 95 year old
[20:04] he was putting it within reach because
[20:06] it wasn't it wasn't
[20:08] uh the lion amen coming down and
[20:11] devouring
[20:12] it was the lamb taking the word and
[20:14] staying with the word and staying
[20:16] obedient to the word
[20:18] and then staying obedient to the word
[20:20] and humbled to that word
[20:21] with no display of a power that would
[20:24] bring him recognition or
[20:26] or would scare away the devil what did
[20:28] he do he took the word amen
[20:30] in simplicity all he did was quote back
[20:33] the word and what was the devil quoting
[20:35] to him the word
[20:37] it was a word battle that was going on
[20:39] in the wilderness and the temptation
[20:41] was around the word amen the devil
[20:43] didn't come to him
[20:44] amen with a a glass of beer
[20:49] the devil didn't come to him with an
[20:52] immoral woman
[20:53] amen the devil came to him with the word
[20:55] and he was
[20:56] trying to use the word in a way that
[20:59] would allow
[21:00] jesus to fulfill a fleshly desire
[21:03] by the word
[21:06] watch this closely now this temptation
[21:10] in the wilderness
[21:11] was an in temptation with alcohol and
[21:14] drugs and
[21:15] and cigarettes and and immorality amen
[21:18] that was not the temptation the testing
[21:20] in the wilderness
[21:21] was over the word amen will you take the
[21:24] word
[21:25] and will you fulfill the desires of the
[21:27] flesh with the word
[21:28] or will you surrender everything and
[21:31] just stay with the word
[21:37] the devil says you're hungry
[21:40] turn these rocks into brother
[21:43] said he could have done it
[21:48] but he told the devil the
[21:52] the word is my bread
[21:55] it's more than my daily bread
[21:58] see he didn't he didn't use the word
[22:03] for selfish gain
[22:08] this is for more than just the young
[22:10] people right here
[22:14] he did not manipulate the word or allow
[22:17] the devil to quote a word in such a way
[22:20] that would allow him any personal gain
[22:22] and he took him up on the pinnacle of
[22:24] the temple and said see all these
[22:26] kingdoms i'll give them all to you if
[22:27] you bow down and worship me
[22:29] and he says it's wrong to worship anyone
[22:31] but god
[22:33] he was what was he tempting him with the
[22:35] lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh
[22:37] and the pride of life
[22:39] but it was so tempting because he was in
[22:42] part using part of the word amen and
[22:44] and you know you're able to make these
[22:46] stones in the bread and he was he was
[22:48] tonsilly poking at him and saying well
[22:50] you know if you're really the son of god
[22:52] if you're really a christian why don't
[22:54] you
[22:54] demonstrate some of your power
[22:58] and the greatest power that he could
[23:00] demonstrate
[23:01] was the ability to recognize the tactics
[23:04] of the devil and stay with the word
[23:08] i can't think of a greater power to be
[23:10] demonstrated in this
[23:12] hour amen there's all kinds of powers
[23:14] that can be demonstrated
[23:15] but those powers amen i just say it as
[23:18] honest as i know how to say it
[23:20] you can have all kinds of gifts of the
[23:22] spirit and demonstrate
[23:23] powers and the gifts of the spirit and
[23:25] those powers have been used over and
[23:27] over to manipulate the word and bring
[23:29] deception
[23:32] but the greatest power that i know of is
[23:36] the ability to lay your life down
[23:38] and surrender and stay with the word and
[23:40] not allow
[23:41] somebody or some spirit to take the word
[23:44] and use the word in a way that you can
[23:47] fulfill your own fleshly desires
[23:49] and still be in the word
[23:55] see deception
[24:00] deception in this hour for the message
[24:03] and the message
[24:04] believers deception is not the bar room
[24:09] it's not i mean it's not the worldliness
[24:11] that's out there
[24:12] deception in this hour is the devil
[24:15] coming in
[24:16] and trying to get you with quotes and
[24:19] with the word
[24:20] amen to fulfill the lust of the flesh
[24:22] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[24:24] life
[24:24] to still have your own will and be
[24:27] religious and stay in the word
[24:33] and jesus prevailed
[24:36] when he was in gethsemane he was
[24:39] prevailing
[24:40] how was he prevailing because jesus as
[24:43] a man brother venom said he was 100 man
[24:47] and 100 god now i'm not even going to
[24:51] attempt to explain that
[24:54] i just believe it in
[24:57] in the 100 percent man part brother of
[25:00] them said he
[25:01] did not want to die
[25:04] he did not want to go through the
[25:06] physical pain of calvary
[25:08] he did not want to separate from those
[25:10] that he loved
[25:11] his disciples he did not want to die
[25:15] that was the 100 percent man parts
[25:20] and he did not he did not want the pain
[25:24] he knew it was coming and he said father
[25:27] if you can
[25:28] let this cup pass from me he knows the
[25:31] will of the father
[25:32] he knows where he's going but yet in his
[25:35] is 100
[25:36] man part he's asking can i bypass this
[25:42] can i bypass this amen and so many times
[25:45] we come to
[25:46] the things in our life is going to
[25:48] require a death to self
[25:52] it's going to require another level of
[25:54] sacrifice
[25:55] another level of surrendering my will my
[25:58] thoughts my ones and when we come to
[26:01] that other level
[26:02] amen it's always i mean we ask the
[26:05] question and it's not wrong to ask the
[26:06] question because jesus did
[26:07] father can i bypass this
[26:10] do i really have to surrender that do i
[26:14] really have to separate from that
[26:16] do i really have to are you really
[26:18] asking me
[26:20] to give that level of sacrifice are you
[26:23] really asking me for that level of death
[26:27] say god can i can i bypass that
[26:31] and that's the tricky time because
[26:33] that's where the devil will slip
[26:35] in and that devil will come in and he'll
[26:38] give you quotes
[26:40] and scriptures and reasons
[26:43] for why you don't need to surrender to
[26:45] this
[26:50] it's the truth it's the truth
[26:55] take the word and manipulate it into a
[26:57] way because
[26:58] if the devil can get you to fulfill your
[27:01] own selfish desire
[27:02] he has knocked you off the plan of god
[27:09] can we take the word
[27:12] by manipulation of the word
[27:16] paint it in such a way that there's
[27:18] relief
[27:19] now there's relief
[27:22] from sacrifice i say
[27:27] it's never good to have relief from
[27:28] sacrifice
[27:30] from personal sacrifice amen
[27:33] jesus was in gethsemane and what was
[27:36] jesus doing in gethsemane
[27:38] overcoming second time
[27:42] father can this cup pass from me
[27:46] he said but nevertheless
[27:49] thy will he was wrestling it out
[27:52] he was fighting and listen friends this
[27:55] wasn't
[27:56] just a little go off to the corner god
[27:58] what do you want this or that
[28:00] okay but he was in so much agony he was
[28:03] in so much
[28:04] physical agony as a human being in the
[28:07] physical agony that
[28:08] he was sweating as it were great drops
[28:10] of blood were coming out
[28:12] friends this is torment this is agony
[28:14] this is pressure this is
[28:15] trouble amen like you and i haven't
[28:17] faced
[28:19] and in that he is still able to say
[28:22] father but not my will
[28:24] and he's so he's so troubled and he's so
[28:26] discouraged he comes back to his
[28:28] disciples and he rebukes them he says
[28:29] could you not wait with me one hour
[28:33] you're leaving me all alone you don't
[28:35] understand what's happening i'm also all
[28:37] alone i'm isolated
[28:38] my soul is exceedingly heavy and
[28:41] exceedingly troubled
[28:43] unto death he said
[28:47] and in gethsemane he was overcoming
[28:54] there are some times that you will
[28:56] overcome
[28:59] and it won't look like uh
[29:03] it won't look like sometimes what we
[29:05] think the testimony service should look
[29:06] like when we say we overcome
[29:09] sometimes our overcoming is alone in the
[29:12] wee hours of the night
[29:13] when nobody's around and we're troubled
[29:16] in our spirit
[29:16] and we're so troubled we're torn and
[29:19] ripped to shreds on the inside
[29:20] and we don't know what to do but god's
[29:22] requiring a greater level of sacrifice a
[29:24] greater level
[29:25] of death to self and we're all caught up
[29:28] in this
[29:28] and we finally surrender our will to god
[29:32] and nobody knows and we don't write it
[29:34] down on a testimony and there's no legs
[29:36] restored and no blinded eyes open amen
[29:38] and there's no great manifestation of
[29:40] power to bring us any glory
[29:42] amen but what happened there was
[29:44] overcoming real genuine overcoming
[29:46] because self was sacrificed self was
[29:49] subdued
[29:50] and the word was put in its place what
[29:52] is the word it's our husband it's our
[29:54] headship amen
[29:56] it's the headship of the body the word
[29:58] of this hour the word that's been
[29:59] restored
[30:00] and we were able amen in the wee hours
[30:02] of the night to be
[30:03] real genuine overcomers
[30:07] and we can't write out a testimony and
[30:09] put it on the desk and have it read
[30:11] because nobody will understand
[30:12] god was asking us to give up some
[30:14] personal little thing
[30:17] god was asking us to separate from
[30:19] something or someone or
[30:21] some place
[30:25] and in the battle many of you have been
[30:27] through the battle you've served god for
[30:29] a while you've been through the battle
[30:31] amen reasoning starts to kick in and it
[30:33] starts to grab
[30:34] scripture and starts to grab quotes and
[30:36] it starts and listen your reasoning will
[30:39] start to massage what the prophet said
[30:43] it will and if you've never been there
[30:46] you will be there
[30:49] the enemy will be right on top of you
[30:53] and begin to take a quote and a
[30:55] scripture and
[30:56] begin to massage it and
[30:59] and paint a picture in such a way that
[31:03] you know you don't have to give this up
[31:06] you don't have to surrender this and
[31:09] those are the hours
[31:10] for the overcomers to say not my will
[31:14] but i will be done i don't understand
[31:17] why
[31:18] it has to be this way i don't understand
[31:20] why i have to give this up i don't
[31:21] understand
[31:22] why this is so important to god i don't
[31:24] understand why the prophet said it that
[31:26] way
[31:26] but i don't have to understand it's fine
[31:29] with me
[31:29] i take it as it is and i believe it and
[31:32] i surrender to it
[31:36] see
[31:40] growing up in the message you can hear
[31:43] so many versions
[31:47] of the message you can hear so many
[31:50] ideas and so many concepts and
[31:54] and it's
[31:58] it's become it's become to a place
[32:02] where you can find the version that
[32:05] suits you best
[32:08] and attach ourselves to that version
[32:11] because it's the version of the message
[32:13] that suits me as my personal human being
[32:17] the best
[32:19] now i'm not at all saying there's not a
[32:21] place where you fit and god has put you
[32:23] in a place and you fit into that place
[32:25] and that place you fit shouldn't should
[32:28] be a match for you it should fit you
[32:30] should match
[32:30] i'm not talking about that but i'm
[32:32] talking about willful
[32:34] selfishness and self-desire
[32:37] things we want to do things we want to
[32:39] things that we want to be okay and
[32:41] things that
[32:42] that we want and we know full well amen
[32:45] we've
[32:45] checked in our heart we know full well
[32:48] it's not right there's a question mark
[32:53] around
[32:53] it and we're just not so certain amen
[32:55] and there's
[32:56] question marks here and question marks
[32:58] there amen and so many times
[33:00] what we'll do is we'll find a voice that
[33:02] will tell us it's okay
[33:04] to go around the question marks amen so
[33:07] that we can quiet that still small voice
[33:09] on the inside
[33:10] and still get to do what we want to do
[33:15] but in gethsemane jesus was overcoming
[33:19] and when we looked at an overcomer when
[33:21] we looked at the line of the tribe of
[33:23] judah the one that had prevailed and
[33:25] overcome
[33:26] when we saw that picture when john
[33:28] looked he heard the announcement of a
[33:30] lion and he was going to see a mighty
[33:32] one a victorious one
[33:33] mighty in battle powerful amen the king
[33:36] of the jungle
[33:38] when he turned the way that the lion
[33:40] overcame was as a lamb
[33:44] and as a bleeding lamb surrendered to
[33:47] the will of god
[33:50] sometimes what god wants is a bloody
[33:53] lamb
[33:55] from us
[33:59] we're mighty warriors that's the truth
[34:03] but we're mighty warriors under the
[34:05] banner of the word
[34:08] not fighting for our own way not mining
[34:11] for our own likes or for our own desires
[34:13] but what we're fighting to do is just
[34:15] uphold the word of god
[34:17] and its purity in the way it was
[34:19] delivered
[34:24] he said
[34:31] brother random goes on to say in the
[34:32] breach a lamb stepped up
[34:35] the elder said the lion has overcome the
[34:37] lion of the tribe of judah and john
[34:39] looked to see the lion
[34:40] and there come a lamb shaking
[34:43] blood on him wounds he had prevailed
[34:47] you could tell he'd been in battle he'd
[34:50] been slain
[34:51] but he was alive again
[34:55] sometimes victory doesn't look like what
[34:58] we think
[34:58] victory looks like in the eyes of the
[35:02] world sometimes
[35:03] victory sometimes victory looks like
[35:06] defeat
[35:07] and what looks like defeat is many times
[35:10] victory
[35:12] what looks like weakness many times his
[35:15] power
[35:20] that can be confusing until you've been
[35:21] through it
[35:23] what looks like a weakness many times is
[35:26] power
[35:28] because it's a power to bring this body
[35:32] subject to the word and bring this body
[35:36] subject to the word
[35:37] it can appear like a weakness amen it's
[35:39] humility
[35:40] it's many times brokenness it's
[35:42] surrender amen
[35:44] it's no self glory no vain glory no
[35:47] no self involved at all and it may look
[35:50] weak and it may look humble and it may
[35:52] look obscure
[35:53] and there's no there's no flash there's
[35:55] no showmanship there's
[35:56] there's nothing to it it's just humble
[35:58] and it's just meek and many times it can
[36:00] be broken and shaking and bleeding
[36:04] an individual broken and weak and
[36:08] trembling
[36:08] and shaking amen and what are they they
[36:11] are the overcomer
[36:12] they're the ones who are mighty in
[36:14] battle this is the invincible army
[36:16] because they'll never be destroyed amen
[36:19] they will never be destroyed because
[36:20] they're standing with the word
[36:22] and standing on the word standing behind
[36:24] the word amen and they can know the word
[36:26] can never be defeated
[36:29] but the lamb part the flesh part
[36:32] can be tore up can be beat down
[36:36] can be mocked ridiculed rejected
[36:40] cast out is that true
[36:43] it can happen and what many times look
[36:45] like weakness
[36:46] many times is a great victory on display
[36:50] where somebody by the grace of god and
[36:52] the spirit of god in their lives
[36:54] are able to say amen i will not i will
[36:57] keep my body
[36:58] and i will bring it under subjection
[37:01] like paul said i keep under my body
[37:04] i buffet it amen i keep under my body to
[37:07] keep it in subjection
[37:08] amen and many times that is
[37:11] power on display
[37:15] in the message the lamb and the dove
[37:18] prophet of god says now i want you to
[37:19] notice another thing
[37:21] the lamb was a willing lamb to be led it
[37:23] was willing
[37:24] and god lamb god's lambs are willing to
[37:27] be led by god's spirit
[37:29] my sheep know my voice a stranger they
[37:31] won't follow
[37:33] see brother bam says sometimes when you
[37:35] get to a place where you meet somebody
[37:37] who's a know-it-all they got the answer
[37:38] to everything he said stay away from
[37:39] that
[37:42] because that's not how god does stuff
[37:43] god will god will will get somebody out
[37:46] on the limb amen
[37:48] and they'll get down a path and they've
[37:49] been led by the spirit of god and then
[37:51] they know that they're where they're
[37:52] supposed to be
[37:53] but they get to a place where where
[37:55] there's no other place to go they get to
[37:57] a red sea they get to a jordan they get
[37:59] out on the limb where they can't go any
[38:00] farther amen and you ask them what are
[38:02] you supposed to do next and you say i
[38:04] don't know
[38:06] where are you going next i don't know
[38:08] what is god doing in your life
[38:10] i don't know that doesn't look like
[38:13] strength
[38:14] that doesn't look like power that
[38:16] doesn't look like mine that doesn't look
[38:17] like
[38:18] a mighty warrior but i'm telling you if
[38:19] they were led if every footstep was led
[38:22] by the spirit of god
[38:23] and they get up against a jordan in a
[38:25] trap and there's no way out
[38:26] they get out on the limb that can no
[38:27] longer hold their weight and there's no
[38:29] other place to go
[38:30] amen that is power that is might that is
[38:32] overcoming right there
[38:34] and it doesn't look the part but it is
[38:37] the part because they were led here by
[38:38] the spirit of god and they're not going
[38:40] to take their own reasoning or their own
[38:41] mind
[38:42] but we'll wait patiently if it's weeks
[38:44] if it's months if it's years
[38:46] we'll wait until god does something to
[38:48] show the next step
[38:55] that's overcoming
[38:58] we wrestle with and overcome we have to
[39:01] wrestle with this guy
[39:04] brother branham said my biggest enemy is
[39:07] william branham
[39:09] it wasn't the denominations it wasn't
[39:12] the spirits
[39:12] it wasn't the 200 000 000 demons that
[39:15] was released out of euphrates
[39:17] that wasn't his biggest enemy that was
[39:19] his enemy but it wasn't his biggest
[39:20] enemy
[39:21] his biggest enemy was self
[39:25] and jesus showed us how to overcome in
[39:27] gethsemane
[39:29] and your biggest enemy is not i mean
[39:32] it's not the government it's not
[39:34] any other power or force amen your
[39:36] biggest enemy is the one that you look
[39:38] at in the mirror in the morning
[39:41] that's why i tried to avoid the mirror
[39:44] i don't need it to comb my hair
[39:49] because i don't even want to look at
[39:50] that guy all my problems all my troubles
[39:54] everything i struggle with is because of
[39:55] that guy that's looking me in the mirror
[39:58] but everybody says you want to blame it
[39:59] on the devil said the devil made you do
[40:00] he said the devil never made you do it
[40:02] you did it of your own selfish lustful
[40:04] desire
[40:05] you did it because you were tempted
[40:07] being tempted you were led away of your
[40:09] own lusts
[40:10] that's what james says no man is tempted
[40:13] of god but he's tempted he's tried he's
[40:15] tested
[40:15] when he is led away of his own lusts
[40:21] and that word lust for young people it
[40:23] doesn't just mean
[40:24] immorality lust amen is anything that
[40:27] you crave or you desire or you want
[40:30] you can lust for an ice cream cone
[40:35] it doesn't make it bad unless it's your
[40:37] tenth
[40:40] then it could be bad you can desire
[40:44] like jesus desired to eat this last meal
[40:47] this last supper with his
[40:49] amen many prophets and women desire
[40:51] that's the same word lust and desire
[40:53] it's a strong desire
[40:55] not every desire is evil amen but the
[40:58] selfish desire
[41:01] is evil
[41:05] you fall we fall
[41:08] we don't fall in sin
[41:12] we don't fall because somebody
[41:16] trapped us although there may be a trap
[41:17] set
[41:19] we don't fall amen we fall
[41:22] because we're led away of our own lusts
[41:25] we're enticed
[41:26] of our own desires
[41:29] and we need to wrestle and overcome
[41:33] that that's why
[41:36] it would be so much better
[41:40] if we realized if everybody if every
[41:43] believer could realize who the enemy
[41:45] really was
[41:46] we wouldn't have any more problems in
[41:48] churches or between churches or
[41:49] or any of that because the problem is
[41:52] not out there the problem is right here
[41:55] and if i could ever conquer this guy and
[41:57] keep him subdued to the word
[41:59] i would never have another problem the
[42:01] rest of my life
[42:03] because every problem i got is because
[42:05] i'm enticed when i'm led away of my own
[42:07] desires
[42:11] but if i can bring every desire
[42:14] every thought amen every imagination
[42:18] captive to the obedience of christ which
[42:20] is the word
[42:21] then i can have victory
[42:26] see we need the word we need the message
[42:29] we need the scripture so much more than
[42:30] we ever realized
[42:33] because just going to church is not
[42:37] enough
[42:41] in fact church is a wonderful place
[42:45] to hide
[42:50] church is a wonderful place to hide
[42:54] because we hear the truth and we can
[42:57] respond
[42:58] to the truth and we're around all the
[43:00] people and there's a great atmosphere
[43:02] it can even feel good we can even like
[43:04] the atmosphere
[43:08] but what we need is the word
[43:12] because the word is what will overcome
[43:14] the word is what will subdue our own
[43:15] lustful desires
[43:16] because when we check it with the word
[43:18] we'll find out that's not the will of
[43:19] god
[43:20] that is not what god wants that is not
[43:22] what god commanded i now must subdue my
[43:25] will and die
[43:26] and buffet this guy and bring it under
[43:28] subjection and
[43:29] and i must put down the flesh and let
[43:31] the word take preeminence take the
[43:33] headship
[43:35] so you realize it's a battle of headship
[43:39] who's going to be the head you
[43:42] are the word you are christ
[43:48] amen let's continue with this quote from
[43:50] the lamb and the dove
[43:54] now it's it's a willing lamb
[43:57] and another thing it was a
[43:59] self-sacrificing lamb
[44:01] it had no selfish motives the lamb was
[44:02] willing to give everything it had
[44:04] a little lamb you can take him out there
[44:06] and he's only got one thing that belongs
[44:08] to him and that's his wool
[44:09] you can throw the little fella up on the
[44:11] table and tie his feet
[44:12] i've done it many times and shave every
[44:15] bit of the
[44:15] of the rights that he has away from him
[44:17] and he'll stand still
[44:19] but oh how different we are oh my
[44:23] you try to shave us one time oh yeah
[44:25] brother we got hot under the collar and
[44:27] tell them off don't we
[44:30] or we just leave the church
[44:36] or we just find a another quote
[44:41] i mean it's the same it's the same thing
[44:43] over and over
[44:45] or we just say i don't know god you've
[44:48] got to judge me
[44:50] god i've been deceived by my
[44:54] own thinking so many times
[45:00] you know so many times when we react and
[45:03] we get flared up we get angry we get
[45:04] upset we heard this and we don't agree
[45:06] with it we think this is wrong
[45:08] and that is wrong but listen friends
[45:09] don't don't forget
[45:11] that your mind is corrupt your emotions
[45:14] are not correct amen
[45:16] and so many times i have been deceived
[45:19] by my
[45:19] own self
[45:23] to the point where i don't trust myself
[45:28] i want to stop and be patient and not
[45:30] react so fast sometimes and just say
[45:32] god show me in your word show me the
[45:36] truth show me what you want amen
[45:42] but how different we are you're trying
[45:44] to shave us one time
[45:46] oh yeah brother we get hot under the
[45:47] collar and tell them off don't we
[45:49] then you wonder what's the matter with
[45:50] us that's right oh a lamb
[45:52] is a willing lamb you say now brother
[45:55] branham
[45:56] and what do you mean listen here you say
[45:58] i'm an american
[45:59] some of you women say i'm an american
[46:00] last week you preached on the way we are
[46:03] wore our makeup you preached on the way
[46:04] we wore our shorts out on the streets
[46:06] and things
[46:06] i'm an american citizen i've got just
[46:08] exactly the right to do what i want to
[46:11] as long as the law puts up with it they
[46:13] sell it in the store that's my american
[46:15] privilege
[46:16] i know but sister if you're a lamb of
[46:18] god you'll forfeit your rights
[46:22] you'll forfeit your constitutional
[46:24] rights
[46:26] for the lamb amen to be a lamb
[46:30] you'll forfeit laodicean rights
[46:33] to be a lamb that's right yes sir you'll
[46:37] forfeit it
[46:37] you say well if i want to stay home and
[46:39] see who loves susie ever what them
[46:41] things
[46:41] are they look at that's my own american
[46:43] privilege i know it but if you're a lamb
[46:45] you'll forfeit it because it's not sheep
[46:47] food amen
[46:49] you say it's american my american
[46:50] privilege if i want to put some beer in
[46:52] an
[46:52] ice box and drink a good gold cold glass
[46:54] at night when i come home from supper
[46:56] that's my own american privilege i know
[46:58] it sir
[46:59] but if you're a lamb you'll forfeit your
[47:01] rights to become a christian
[47:02] that's exactly right amen
[47:08] see
[47:12] we want i don't know about you but so
[47:15] many times we want
[47:17] we want to be seen as powerful and
[47:20] capable and and all these things
[47:24] but jesus when he stepped forward on the
[47:28] scene
[47:29] and what brother branham called the most
[47:30] sublime scripture in all the bible
[47:34] when he stepped forward to take the book
[47:37] he
[47:38] was the lion that had overcome but when
[47:40] he stepped forward to take the book
[47:42] see god god has nothing to prove
[47:47] jesus is not about saving a reputation
[47:50] or looking good in the eyes of man
[47:52] i mean he's dealing with the reality of
[47:54] things and when he when he come
[47:56] forward when he stepped forward in the
[47:57] most sublime scripture in all the bible
[47:59] when he stepped forward to take the book
[48:01] how did he take the book he took the
[48:03] book and the form that he prevailed in
[48:06] as a humble lamb submissive to the will
[48:09] of god
[48:10] if it meant beating it was beating
[48:15] if it meant if it meant losing his
[48:17] reputation he lost his reputation losing
[48:19] his friends he lost his friends
[48:22] if it meant crucifixion he would take
[48:24] crucifixion
[48:26] because he was a lamb
[48:32] see samson
[48:37] was a mighty warrior simpson in mighty
[48:40] power he had mighty gifts he had mighty
[48:42] strength
[48:43] and samson in his gifts he could destroy
[48:46] the enemy out there but
[48:49] samson's gifts and his power could not
[48:52] destroy the enemy in here
[48:56] he could slay demons by the thousands
[48:59] he could cast out demons by the laying
[49:01] on of hands he could anoint with oil and
[49:03] pray for the sick
[49:04] you see what i'm saying he could he
[49:07] could fight
[49:07] demons out there amen but he couldn't
[49:10] overcome himself
[49:12] his own selfish desire and his own lust
[49:15] amen to have a woman that was not his
[49:17] not rightfully so
[49:18] amen he could not sampson could conquer
[49:21] the philistine sampson couldn't conquer
[49:23] samson
[49:28] let's look at this let's go to judge
[49:30] just for a minute
[49:35] let's go to judges chapter 16.
[49:50] let's go 16 and verse 27.
[49:53] samson has been captured he told his
[49:56] secret to delilah and she was trapping
[49:58] him
[49:59] and see the philistines
[50:03] did not defeat samson
[50:07] samson defeated samson and delilah did
[50:11] not defeat samson
[50:13] sampson defeated samson because none of
[50:16] them could touch him
[50:18] as long as he stayed with the word but
[50:20] when he gave up the secret it was
[50:22] willing to give
[50:22] up the promise the covenant with god
[50:25] when he was willing to
[50:26] tamper with that and give it up now
[50:28] delilah could defeat him the philistines
[50:29] could defeat him
[50:30] so samson was defeated by samson
[50:35] and you and i are defeated by ourselves
[50:43] he says in verse 27 he's been captured
[50:46] his eyes have been plucked out he's been
[50:48] down chained to a mill grinding at the
[50:50] mill
[50:51] wasting away but he felt that his hair
[50:54] was growing back the covenant was coming
[50:56] back
[50:58] and now as the covenant's coming back
[51:01] when he lost the covenant he realized
[51:03] how weak he was
[51:06] you know we can get the idea that
[51:10] because god has blessed us how many has
[51:12] been blessed by god
[51:14] abundantly blessed by god healed and
[51:16] delivered and provided for
[51:18] and that's the way samson was under the
[51:20] covenant promise
[51:21] and samson begin to think amen that it
[51:24] was him
[51:27] that it was him that was conquering it
[51:29] was him that was defeating
[51:30] it was him and he didn't realize it was
[51:33] the promised word that he was under
[51:36] and sometimes we think that it's us
[51:38] that's been successful i got a raise at
[51:40] work i
[51:40] they told me i did a good job and i
[51:42] figured this out and i
[51:44] accomplished this and i amen
[51:47] you don't realize you're under the
[51:49] blessings of a covenant it's not you
[51:51] it's the covenant that god has with you
[51:53] and he's promised you promises of taking
[51:55] care of you
[51:55] and providing for you and it's not your
[51:57] intellect it's not your ability i mean
[52:00] it's god
[52:02] because if we take that covenant away
[52:03] from you for a little while
[52:05] watch what happens to you you'll wind up
[52:07] amen like samson you'll wind up with
[52:09] your eyes poked out
[52:10] no more vision amen you walked up with
[52:12] your covenant chopped off and you'll be
[52:13] grinding at the meal wondering what
[52:16] happened
[52:19] and sometimes in god's grace he lets us
[52:21] get a taste of that every once in a
[52:23] while
[52:24] every once in a while god will let us do
[52:27] it on our
[52:28] own and when it comes to absolute ruin
[52:30] amen he'll come
[52:32] by and he'll let you it'll let you know
[52:34] that was you
[52:37] samson grinding at the male samson with
[52:39] his eyes plucked out
[52:41] samson but he feels a covenant coming
[52:43] back i promise he remembers the promise
[52:48] it says in verse 27 now the house was
[52:51] full of men and women and all the lords
[52:52] of the philistines were there
[52:54] and they were upon the roof of about 3
[52:56] 000 men and women that beheld while
[52:57] samson made spore
[52:59] and samson called unto the lord and said
[53:01] oh lord god remember me i pray thee
[53:03] and strengthen me i pray thee only this
[53:05] once o god
[53:07] then i may be at once avenge the
[53:09] philistines from my two eyes
[53:11] and samson took hold of the two middle
[53:13] pillars of which the house stood on
[53:15] a stood and on which it was born up of
[53:18] the one with his right hand and the
[53:20] other with his left
[53:21] and samson said let me die with the
[53:26] philistines
[53:29] let me die with the philistines
[53:32] and he bowed himself with all his might
[53:34] and the house fell upon the lords and
[53:36] upon all the people that were there on
[53:38] so the dead which he slew at his death
[53:40] were more than they which he slew
[53:42] in his life i say the same thing's true
[53:45] for you and i friends
[53:54] and the collapse of the house
[53:58] samson parted with his greatest enemy
[54:03] which was himself
[54:06] he finally recognized and he said let me
[54:09] die
[54:10] with the philistines he wasn't looking
[54:13] to save his life preserve his life to
[54:15] have his way anymore he was just there
[54:17] to finish his commission which was to
[54:18] deliver israel
[54:20] to begin to deliver israel from the
[54:22] stronghold of the philistines
[54:23] and he bound himself down with all his
[54:25] mind and what was he doing
[54:26] he was getting back in the purpose of
[54:28] god back in the calling of god
[54:30] and when he bound himself down he made
[54:32] an absolute full surrender
[54:34] as a lamb and said let me die
[54:37] with the philistines because his purpose
[54:40] his calling was to begin to deliver them
[54:43] from the philistines
[54:45] and so he didn't just destroy the enemy
[54:47] out there but
[54:48] but he had destroyed the enemy in here
[54:53] oh i wish i wish that i could have that
[54:57] same approach
[54:58] all the time let me die
[55:02] not just slay on my enemies let me die
[55:05] let
[55:06] me surrender let me be a perfect lamb
[55:09] because that's where real overcoming
[55:10] comes in that's where real power is on
[55:13] display
[55:13] that's where really that's where things
[55:15] really begin to move
[55:17] when you can't move them but you've
[55:19] surrendered to the force that can
[55:21] that's when real moving takes place
[55:25] as long as we can do and we think we can
[55:27] do it sometimes god will let us do it
[55:28] and all we do is sometimes prolong our
[55:30] own deliverance or we keep muddling up
[55:32] things that don't need to be muddled up
[55:33] anymore but what we need to do sometimes
[55:35] is say just take me slay me
[55:37] i cannot fix anything i cannot do
[55:40] anything
[55:40] i cannot get this right i'm just going
[55:42] to lay down here and ask you lord to
[55:44] take care of this for me
[55:46] and show me what you want me to do
[55:53] let's turn to genesis 32.
[55:58] i want to take a few minutes and look at
[56:00] the life of jacob
[56:10] genesis 32 first i'm going to read this
[56:14] quote here from
[56:15] hearing recognizing acting on the word
[56:16] of god
[56:19] so you must realize then friend what
[56:21] condition you're in
[56:23] that's the reason this tape i said to
[56:25] the church only to the church only
[56:27] if you've been called from light from
[56:29] darkness and delight from death and the
[56:30] life
[56:31] from a formal intellectual conception of
[56:33] christ to a born-again experience
[56:35] and watching your life and it lays in
[56:37] the things of the world
[56:38] aside and it lays the things of the
[56:40] world aside and you stand for christ
[56:42] regardless
[56:43] then something's happened there's
[56:45] something
[56:46] in you hungering and moving like it was
[56:48] jacob
[56:50] you wrestle with the lord you walk
[56:52] different after that
[56:53] something's different in you you've
[56:55] changed
[56:56] mother rams now is going to start typing
[56:58] us with jacob and we're going to read
[57:00] the scripture but he says
[57:01] if you're willing to lay all the world
[57:03] aside and you don't want it anymore i
[57:05] mean
[57:06] something in you has changed there's
[57:07] been a change that's taken place
[57:10] and in genesis 32 verse 28
[57:14] it says and he said thy name shall be
[57:17] called no more jacob
[57:19] but israel for as a prince has thou
[57:22] power with god and with men
[57:23] and has prevailed that's the same word
[57:27] prevailed wrestle with and overcome
[57:31] see jacob was in trouble
[57:35] jacob with his own intellect had had
[57:39] found a way to get things for himself
[57:42] he had gotten the birthright off of his
[57:44] brother he had gotten the blessing with
[57:46] the help of his mom and
[57:48] and their their devious plan to deceive
[57:50] his father
[57:51] he went to laban and he got a wife and
[57:53] and he was deceived there and he got two
[57:55] wives but
[57:56] but before he left he had deceived his
[57:58] father-in-law amen and come up with a
[58:00] plan that would allow him
[58:01] to to get all the cattle from his
[58:03] father-in-law and he
[58:04] and he spoiled his father-in-law as he
[58:06] left
[58:08] see jacob in his own human ability with
[58:11] his own intellect
[58:12] he was able he was called brother ben
[58:14] called him a shyster a supplanter is
[58:16] what the bible
[58:17] that his name actually meant the
[58:18] brotherhood said little shyster he was
[58:20] able to wheel and deal and he was able
[58:22] to pull a fast one here and there
[58:23] and he got the birthright and he got the
[58:25] blessing and he spoiled laban's
[58:27] household
[58:32] but eventually that all catches up with
[58:34] you
[58:36] i promise you some of some
[58:40] some here are more and more intellectual
[58:43] prowess than others
[58:45] some have more abilities than others
[58:47] some can wheel and deal some can
[58:49] overcome
[58:50] some have a strong will we all have
[58:51] different things but when we continue to
[58:53] exercise those things for our own
[58:56] personal gain
[58:57] i tell you at some point there's going
[58:58] to be a day of reckoning
[59:01] and jacob had deceived and deceived and
[59:03] gained and gained
[59:04] until he now he's coming back into the
[59:06] land and he's coming back into the land
[59:08] he finds his brother esau is now coming
[59:10] and he believes his brother esau is
[59:12] coming to destroy him
[59:13] and rightfully so
[59:17] because all of his own efforts landed
[59:18] him in a heap of trouble
[59:24] and so now jacob he separates
[59:28] all his wealth and he separates across
[59:30] the river and he
[59:31] takes his wives and his children here
[59:32] and he goes alone across the river
[59:34] and now jacob because jacob has got
[59:37] himself in a fix by his
[59:38] own his own strength
[59:42] his own ability has gotten him in this
[59:44] place why
[59:45] because of his own lusts has gotten him
[59:49] into place
[59:49] now he's in desperation
[59:53] it's amazing that we do this to
[59:55] ourselves
[59:56] so many times of our own lusts and our
[1:00:00] own desires
[1:00:01] and of our own strengths we get
[1:00:03] ourselves in a place of desperation
[1:00:06] but praise god though jacob was the one
[1:00:08] who was guilty though jacob was the one
[1:00:10] who had worked his own intellect and got
[1:00:11] him to this situation amen jacob had no
[1:00:14] way to get to the angel but the angel
[1:00:16] came to him
[1:00:18] god is so faithful amen he he he's so
[1:00:22] faithful that it'll allow us
[1:00:23] you run that way that's fine there's a
[1:00:25] day of reckoning coming and when we
[1:00:27] finally get on our face and cry out to
[1:00:28] god
[1:00:29] and get desperate before god and we got
[1:00:31] a mess on our hands amen it's he who
[1:00:33] knows how to find
[1:00:34] us
[1:00:37] jacob 32 or sorry genesis 32.
[1:00:42] verse 28
[1:00:45] he wrestled with the angel and the angel
[1:00:48] says and he said thy name
[1:00:50] shall be called no more jacob but israel
[1:00:53] for as a prince has thou power with god
[1:00:55] and with men and has
[1:00:57] prevailed and jacob asked him and said
[1:01:00] tell me i pray thee thy name
[1:01:02] and he said wherefore is it that thou
[1:01:04] just ask after my name
[1:01:05] and he blessed him there and jacob
[1:01:08] called the name of the place
[1:01:09] pineal for i have seen god face to face
[1:01:12] and my life is preserved who was it that
[1:01:16] jacob was wrestling with
[1:01:17] he was wrestling with god
[1:01:21] and as he passed over pinwell the sun
[1:01:25] rose upon him and he halted upon his
[1:01:28] thigh
[1:01:30] this experience for jacob changed his
[1:01:33] walk for life
[1:01:35] motherboard is going to refer to this
[1:01:37] and he's going to type it with a new
[1:01:39] birth experience
[1:01:40] he got into a place where he had made
[1:01:42] himself a mess
[1:01:44] and all around him was a mess and he had
[1:01:46] got himself in trouble by his own
[1:01:48] intellect and his own
[1:01:49] in his own lust and his own willfulness
[1:01:51] amen but in desperation amen he come in
[1:01:54] contact with god
[1:01:55] amen and when he when he grew and god
[1:01:57] came to him when he come in contact with
[1:01:59] god
[1:02:00] amen for jacob it was not a light thing
[1:02:03] it was not a trivial thing
[1:02:04] but for jacob it became desperation and
[1:02:07] he got a hold of this angel which he
[1:02:09] called a man
[1:02:10] and he got a hold of this angel and he
[1:02:12] wouldn't turn him loose
[1:02:14] and he said the angel said turn me loose
[1:02:16] and he said i'll not turn you
[1:02:18] i'm not turning you loose until you
[1:02:20] bless me
[1:02:23] and how did he bless him friends what
[1:02:25] was the blessing that jacob walked away
[1:02:27] with
[1:02:27] there was two things that jacob walked
[1:02:29] away with in this blessing
[1:02:30] he had a new name and he had a new walk
[1:02:34] that was the blessing he didn't give him
[1:02:36] money he didn't give him promises of
[1:02:38] wealth he didn't give him anything
[1:02:40] when he said i will not let you go till
[1:02:42] you bless me he touched his thigh
[1:02:44] amen and it shrunk up and he changed his
[1:02:47] walk
[1:02:49] and he changed his name
[1:02:53] from sir planter to prince
[1:02:57] because he was a prince with god
[1:03:01] see the blessings that we need friends
[1:03:03] are not money and wealth and good jobs
[1:03:06] and
[1:03:06] god has promised to clothe us the lilies
[1:03:09] are clothed amen
[1:03:11] the sparrows are the god has promised
[1:03:13] that that's not what we need friends
[1:03:15] what we need is an encounter with god
[1:03:17] where we come in contact with a true and
[1:03:18] living god amen and we get a hold of him
[1:03:21] and said i'll not let go till you bless
[1:03:23] me
[1:03:23] and what will that blessing look like it
[1:03:25] won't be a position in a church it won't
[1:03:27] be a better job in a better car
[1:03:29] but if you ever get the blessing from
[1:03:31] god if you meet him face to face and
[1:03:33] wrestle it out with him the blessing
[1:03:35] you'll get is a change in your name
[1:03:36] and a change in your walk
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:41] this is this is what i want to tell you
[1:03:43] young people amen you got to have an
[1:03:45] encounter with the living god amen
[1:03:47] don't go your own way and don't use your
[1:03:50] own intellect and don't think because i
[1:03:52] know about the message and i know to
[1:03:53] stay away from this and i know to follow
[1:03:55] this
[1:03:55] listen because you know right and wrong
[1:03:58] because you've been taught
[1:03:59] what god likes and doesn't like there's
[1:04:01] a certain amount of blessings that comes
[1:04:03] from living a righteous life
[1:04:05] and you will be blessed and you will be
[1:04:07] sheltered and you will be protected
[1:04:08] but that is not the same as coming in
[1:04:10] contact with the living
[1:04:12] god and him touching the hollow of your
[1:04:14] thigh and changing your walk for the
[1:04:15] rest of your life and giving you
[1:04:17] personally to you a new name amen
[1:04:23] don't be mistaken because many times by
[1:04:26] an intellect
[1:04:27] and good upbringing and parents that
[1:04:29] love you in a church that surrounds you
[1:04:31] you can come to a place where you can
[1:04:33] keep the things of god
[1:04:34] and in keeping those things of god by
[1:04:36] your own willpower
[1:04:38] and your own understanding there'll be a
[1:04:39] certain amount of blessing and
[1:04:41] protection
[1:04:41] and you will succeed in natural life
[1:04:49] but don't be surprised if god allows all
[1:04:51] that to come to a dead end someday
[1:04:57] where even your ability your
[1:04:59] understanding and your knowledge and
[1:05:00] your ability to do right and wrong won't
[1:05:02] be enough
[1:05:05] and all your plans and all the
[1:05:08] selfishness that we held on to
[1:05:10] and wanting to do it our own way but
[1:05:11] still you know the religion
[1:05:14] keeping it right some point
[1:05:18] god will allow us to come come to a dead
[1:05:21] end and say it's not working anymore
[1:05:24] i'm getting myself in trouble
[1:05:28] and that's the grace of god because when
[1:05:30] you get to that place
[1:05:31] it's he who finds you not you who find
[1:05:33] him
[1:05:35] he finds you amen i'll give you this
[1:05:38] advice
[1:05:38] when he comes your way and you know
[1:05:40] you're in the presence of god you may
[1:05:42] not see a man in a robe you may not have
[1:05:44] any physical
[1:05:44] anything you can put your hands on but
[1:05:46] when you know you've come in contact
[1:05:48] with the power with the living god get a
[1:05:50] hold of it with everything you've got
[1:05:51] and say i cannot turn this loose until
[1:05:54] you bless me
[1:05:56] and don't ask for anything physical
[1:05:58] friends it's not the physical that you
[1:06:00] need
[1:06:01] amen it's a change in your life and it's
[1:06:03] a change in your name
[1:06:09] jacob became israel because he held on
[1:06:12] he prevailed with god and with man he
[1:06:15] wrestled it out
[1:06:16] and he overcame and what was his victory
[1:06:19] march like after that
[1:06:27] it never looks like what we think
[1:06:29] overcoming looks like
[1:06:38] god sometimes will let us go through
[1:06:40] things we come and i let those things
[1:06:43] scarred we come out of those things
[1:06:47] halting upon our leg sometimes for the
[1:06:50] rest of our lives
[1:06:53] never able to fully get over that
[1:06:56] leaving the word of god never able to
[1:06:57] fully get over
[1:06:59] that selfishness and my own selfish
[1:07:01] desires have taken me down the wrong
[1:07:02] path wrong choices in relationships
[1:07:06] wrong choices in marriage is wrong
[1:07:10] you can't get past some of that
[1:07:13] but when god comes down and changes your
[1:07:15] walk and changes your name
[1:07:16] that becomes a victory march
[1:07:19] amen because you're able to stay with
[1:07:21] the word
[1:07:23] stay with the word surrender myself
[1:07:27] surrender my will surrender my life and
[1:07:29] stay with the word
[1:07:33] brother ram goes on to say now
[1:07:36] he had to divide the lands and there
[1:07:40] were 12
[1:07:40] tribes to divide it by now what if he
[1:07:44] had some
[1:07:45] uh picks and pets he's talking about
[1:07:46] joshua what if joshua would just
[1:07:49] give preference to this one or that one
[1:07:50] what if he had picks and pets and what
[1:07:52] if he liked the tribe of gad better than
[1:07:54] that
[1:07:54] did the tribe of ephraim the tribe of
[1:07:56] joseph better than he did judah
[1:07:58] but he didn't do it that way he divided
[1:07:59] according to the word revealed by the
[1:08:01] spirit
[1:08:02] he divided according to the tribe and
[1:08:04] notice he done it by the revelation by
[1:08:06] discernment
[1:08:07] by the discernment of god's spirit he
[1:08:09] did it
[1:08:10] and each one of those hebrew mothers
[1:08:12] giving birth to those babies called
[1:08:14] their name
[1:08:14] each one of their name has a meaning
[1:08:18] jacob when he was born being a twin she
[1:08:19] called him sir planter jacob
[1:08:21] but he got his overcoming power and
[1:08:23] wrestled with the angel god changed his
[1:08:25] name from jacob to a prince
[1:08:26] israel a prince the name has something
[1:08:29] to do with your life
[1:08:30] when peter a fisherman had overcome by
[1:08:32] his faith in jesus he said your name is
[1:08:34] simon
[1:08:35] but i'm going to call you peter which is
[1:08:37] little rock
[1:08:38] it changes you your name has something
[1:08:41] to do with it
[1:08:42] your placement in this life
[1:08:46] the change in the name had something to
[1:08:49] do
[1:08:50] with jacob becoming israel had something
[1:08:53] to do with just change had something to
[1:08:54] do with his placement in life
[1:08:57] and in the exodus journey when the
[1:08:59] mothers were bearing the children
[1:09:01] they would call out the tribal name over
[1:09:02] them as they were born and that tribal
[1:09:04] name would place them
[1:09:06] in a certain place in the land
[1:09:10] and i tell you when you're birthed in
[1:09:11] the kingdom today it matters what name
[1:09:14] is called over you when you're birthed
[1:09:17] because we're not birthed under a former
[1:09:19] tribe of a former denomination we're not
[1:09:21] birthed
[1:09:21] under under wesleyanism we're not
[1:09:23] birthed under pentecostalism but we're
[1:09:25] birthed in the bright age amen we're
[1:09:26] birthed amen
[1:09:28] we're birthed in the bright age we're
[1:09:30] birthed into the bride
[1:09:32] because where your birth amen the name
[1:09:34] that's called over you in your birth
[1:09:36] amen
[1:09:36] has to do with your position in life and
[1:09:38] where you're placed
[1:09:42] we don't want to be placed in a former
[1:09:44] age we want to be placed in another
[1:09:45] tribe
[1:09:46] amen those were all tribes those were
[1:09:48] all five they all had their position
[1:09:49] they had their placing
[1:09:50] amen but i want to be placed in the
[1:09:52] right place today
[1:09:57] your name has something to do with it
[1:09:58] your placement in life
[1:10:01] to all in the message in his presence oh
[1:10:04] what a great thing it
[1:10:05] was now to know that he had wrestled
[1:10:08] through
[1:10:08] that he had seen signs of god he had
[1:10:11] dreams about god
[1:10:12] but this was one time he was in the face
[1:10:14] of god
[1:10:16] in the presence of god think of it
[1:10:19] friends
[1:10:19] now as we hurry up in the presence of
[1:10:21] god a man has changed
[1:10:23] a jacob was changed now he could walk
[1:10:26] with god
[1:10:27] excuse me he could walk with god yes he
[1:10:29] was a different man than what he was
[1:10:31] when he went up there the battle was now
[1:10:33] over
[1:10:35] he had wrestled and overcome
[1:10:39] i want to read a lengthy section on the
[1:10:41] first seal
[1:10:43] this will help me wrap up my thoughts
[1:10:45] said i wish i could stop on that just a
[1:10:47] minute oh my
[1:10:48] i got a good notion but maybe nobody
[1:10:51] knows it did you ever know the name of
[1:10:53] jehovah is not correct
[1:10:54] anybody knows dr vale you know it's true
[1:10:56] the translators could never translate it
[1:10:57] spell it
[1:10:58] j-u-h-v it means it's it isn't jehovah
[1:11:02] they
[1:11:02] they couldn't touch it they don't know
[1:11:04] what it is called it jehovah but it
[1:11:06] wasn't his name
[1:11:06] look every time a victory is one or
[1:11:08] something goes on a name has changed
[1:11:12] catch that jacob prevailed with god and
[1:11:14] his name changed to israel
[1:11:18] look at the days of abraham he was abram
[1:11:20] and never could have
[1:11:21] had the baby until his name was changed
[1:11:23] to abraham and sarah
[1:11:25] could could not have nothing but a dead
[1:11:27] woman until her name was changed to
[1:11:29] sarah
[1:11:30] jacob means supplant or deceiver and
[1:11:31] that's what he did he put sheepskin on
[1:11:33] himself and deceived his prophet father
[1:11:35] to take the birthright
[1:11:36] he put poplar sticks in the water
[1:11:38] speckled them and scared the cattle
[1:11:40] when they was pregnated with their young
[1:11:42] to make speckled cattle and sheep
[1:11:45] nothing but a deceiver but one night he
[1:11:47] caught a hold of something real
[1:11:48] and he knowed it was real and he stayed
[1:11:51] with it and held on
[1:11:52] until he overcame and his name was
[1:11:54] changed and called israel meaning prince
[1:11:56] with power before god
[1:11:58] is that right every overcomer simon was
[1:12:01] a fisherman but when his faith
[1:12:02] caught and no that was jesus when he
[1:12:05] told him he was the messiah and told him
[1:12:07] who his name was and what his father's
[1:12:08] name was he was overcome and changed
[1:12:10] from simon to peter
[1:12:13] saul was a good name saul was a king one
[1:12:15] time in israel but saul didn't fit an
[1:12:17] apostle
[1:12:18] might be all right for a king but not an
[1:12:20] apostle so jesus
[1:12:22] changed his name from what from saul to
[1:12:24] paul
[1:12:25] look at the sons of thunder and oh now
[1:12:27] and jesus his name on earth was redeemer
[1:12:29] jesus when he was on earth he was the
[1:12:31] redeemer that's true
[1:12:32] but when he conquered death and hell and
[1:12:34] overcame and ascended on high he
[1:12:35] received a new name
[1:12:38] that's the reason they holler the way
[1:12:39] they do and they don't get nothing
[1:12:41] it'll be revealed in the thunders i'm
[1:12:43] going to talk about this for a minute
[1:12:45] but just
[1:12:46] just hang on to that i'm going to finish
[1:12:47] the quote and we'll come back
[1:12:49] now the mystery he is coming writing
[1:12:52] there's got to be
[1:12:53] something to change this church you know
[1:12:55] that there's got to be something noticed
[1:12:57] no man knoweth but himself what's that
[1:13:00] his name
[1:13:02] now notice no man no node but himself
[1:13:05] and he was clothed with a vester dipped
[1:13:07] in blood and his name was called the
[1:13:08] word of god he's reading right out of
[1:13:10] revelation 19. and the armies which were
[1:13:13] in heaven followed him upon white horses
[1:13:15] clothed and fine linen white and clean
[1:13:17] and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword
[1:13:19] with
[1:13:20] that with it he should smite the nations
[1:13:22] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[1:13:24] iron and he tread the winepress of the
[1:13:26] fierceness and wrath of almighty god
[1:13:28] and he had on his vesture and on his
[1:13:30] thigh a name written king of kings
[1:13:32] and lord of lords there comes the
[1:13:35] messiah
[1:13:37] oh thank you brother i'll take that
[1:13:40] right now
[1:13:45] god has answered my prayer
[1:13:49] and he had a vesture and on his thigh a
[1:13:51] name written king of kings and lord of
[1:13:53] lords
[1:13:54] there comes the messiah there he there
[1:13:56] he is not this fellow on this horse back
[1:13:58] here
[1:13:59] what's the difference it's talking about
[1:14:00] the pale horse rider here he stands with
[1:14:02] the book in his hand here
[1:14:04] the redemptive work he hasn't took his
[1:14:06] place yet so it was not christ that went
[1:14:08] forth the holy spirit
[1:14:10] not disagreeing with them great men no
[1:14:11] sir i don't do it i wouldn't want to do
[1:14:13] that
[1:14:13] but this is what my revelation of it is
[1:14:15] see you got something different well
[1:14:17] that's all right but it ain't all right
[1:14:19] with me i believe it this way
[1:14:22] and notice christ is not seen anymore
[1:14:24] from that time there
[1:14:25] but he is on a white horse so if this
[1:14:27] guy is riding a white horse he's only an
[1:14:30] impersonator of christ get that notice
[1:14:32] the writer on the white horse doesn't
[1:14:34] have any name
[1:14:35] he might use two or three titles but he
[1:14:37] hasn't got any name
[1:14:38] but christ has a name
[1:14:44] what is it the word of god
[1:14:47] and his name is called the word of god
[1:14:52] that's what it is in the beginning was
[1:14:54] the word and the word was with god and
[1:14:55] the word
[1:14:56] was god and the word made flesh see and
[1:14:58] the writer has no name but christ is
[1:15:00] called the word of god
[1:15:02] that's what he is he is called that
[1:15:07] see every time there's a great victory
[1:15:09] there's a name change and now we see him
[1:15:10] in revelations 19 and in revelation 19
[1:15:13] he's already come through revelations 5.
[1:15:15] he took the book revelation
[1:15:16] 10 amen the mighty angels descended with
[1:15:18] the book and now
[1:15:20] he's gathering his armies to come to the
[1:15:22] great standoff on the battle of
[1:15:23] armageddon
[1:15:24] and he's got a name because there's been
[1:15:25] a victory there's been redemption
[1:15:27] he's been the kinsmen redeemer redeeming
[1:15:29] through the church ages but now he's
[1:15:30] coming to claim his possession
[1:15:33] and when he comes to claim his
[1:15:35] possession amen he's got a name
[1:15:37] amen and his name is called the word of
[1:15:39] god because in this
[1:15:40] hour it's been revealed to us that he is
[1:15:43] the full revelation of the word of god
[1:15:45] the mystery of god revealed is christ he
[1:15:48] is the word
[1:15:51] and we know him we know his name
[1:15:55] it denotes a great victory
[1:15:59] i want to read out of a message called
[1:16:01] how can i overcome
[1:16:03] i'm reading just a few things but i hope
[1:16:04] by the grace of god we can tie it
[1:16:06] together so just let me lay these pieces
[1:16:07] down
[1:16:09] now look let's take now the 12th verse
[1:16:12] he's in revelation chapter 3.
[1:16:17] this to the church of philadelphia in
[1:16:18] the 12th verse him that overcometh what
[1:16:20] i make a pillar in the temple of my god
[1:16:23] he shall go no more out and i will write
[1:16:25] upon him my name
[1:16:26] name of my god in the name of the city
[1:16:28] of my god which is new jerusalem which
[1:16:29] cometh down out of heaven from god
[1:16:31] and i will write upon him my new name
[1:16:35] he's saying now there's there's promises
[1:16:37] and we know that these promises
[1:16:39] amen the promise that's given to one age
[1:16:42] carries over to the next stage
[1:16:44] the overcomer of ephesus we're given a
[1:16:46] right to the tree of life amen and
[1:16:48] brother ben said now that right to the
[1:16:49] tree of life is for every overcomer that
[1:16:51] overcomes in every age
[1:16:54] so now if we overcome laodicea as we've
[1:16:57] overcome
[1:16:57] what's overcome it's the same word as
[1:17:00] prevail to wrestle with and overcome
[1:17:03] we've wrestled with people's rights
[1:17:04] we've wrestled with laodicean conditions
[1:17:06] we've wrestled with and overcome by what
[1:17:09] surrendering like a lamb by giving
[1:17:11] ourselves
[1:17:14] and he says now you have rights all of
[1:17:16] these promises
[1:17:17] if you overcome in this day all of these
[1:17:20] promises are yours because they're
[1:17:21] promises to the overcomer
[1:17:23] but here in the philadelphian age he
[1:17:24] said and i will write upon him
[1:17:26] my new name
[1:17:30] watch what the overcomer is promising
[1:17:32] now the laodicea
[1:17:34] that's the last church day there's going
[1:17:35] to be some overcomers in there watch
[1:17:38] they remember each church age the one
[1:17:40] proceeding inherits all that the other
[1:17:42] ones offered
[1:17:44] watch up here now here it's after they
[1:17:46] done received all these powers these new
[1:17:48] names and
[1:17:49] everything written that he promised and
[1:17:51] eat the hidden man and all down through
[1:17:53] watch the last church age revelations 3
[1:17:55] 21 to him that overcometh will i grant
[1:17:57] to sit with me in my throne
[1:17:59] even as i also overcome and i'm sit down
[1:18:02] with my father in his throne
[1:18:04] he that has an ear let him hear what the
[1:18:06] spirit saith to the churches
[1:18:08] there's the reward for the overcomers
[1:18:11] press on
[1:18:12] lily he throws this in he was talking
[1:18:15] about this earlier press
[1:18:16] on lily he's talking about the little
[1:18:18] lily amen and the he always admired a
[1:18:20] pond literally
[1:18:21] because upon linde starts out under the
[1:18:24] waters down
[1:18:25] in the muck and the mud amen and down in
[1:18:27] there there's a life a beautiful life
[1:18:29] laying there
[1:18:30] but it it's a life that is uh uh
[1:18:33] not on betray it's not displayed it's a
[1:18:36] hidden life
[1:18:38] but it's got a push through the muck
[1:18:40] what's it doing it's climbing its way to
[1:18:42] the sunlight
[1:18:43] there's light penetrating through the
[1:18:44] water and light coming down through the
[1:18:46] mud
[1:18:47] and that light and when it hits the seed
[1:18:49] it's starting to bring a life
[1:18:50] out of that little lily and it's moving
[1:18:52] up through the mud and it's coming up
[1:18:54] through the muddy water
[1:18:55] and when it gets up out of the water it
[1:18:57] spreads forth amen and it begins to
[1:18:59] bloom and brother branham thought that
[1:19:00] was the most beautiful flower of them
[1:19:02] all
[1:19:03] because of the story that the lily tells
[1:19:05] and then it gives its fragrance for all
[1:19:07] to enjoy
[1:19:10] here he comes now and he's talking about
[1:19:11] the promises to the overcomer
[1:19:13] and he says press on lily press on
[1:19:16] be an overcomer push through the mud
[1:19:19] push through the muddy water
[1:19:20] amen we can't be lazy christians amen
[1:19:24] when we come in contact with the living
[1:19:25] god
[1:19:26] amen it would not have worked for jacob
[1:19:28] to have a change if jacob would have
[1:19:29] come in contact with the angel
[1:19:31] and said hey you have a nice day and if
[1:19:33] you think of me down the road would you
[1:19:35] send back blessings
[1:19:36] my way but he was in a desperation he
[1:19:38] couldn't fix his own problem
[1:19:40] he had messed himself up and could not
[1:19:42] fix himself and when he come in contact
[1:19:44] with the living god
[1:19:45] he had enough sense to get a hold of it
[1:19:47] and not turn it loose till it changed
[1:19:49] him
[1:19:50] and brother man i was talking about the
[1:19:52] overcomer in each age overcoming
[1:19:54] overcoming overcoming to wrestle with
[1:19:56] and prevail
[1:19:56] he says press on lily don't stop amen
[1:19:59] until we come to full bloom
[1:20:04] know a half-hearted effort is not going
[1:20:07] to work
[1:20:09] you'll seek me he says in jeremiah and
[1:20:11] find me when you search for me with
[1:20:13] all of your heart
[1:20:18] it's not enough to be associated with
[1:20:20] the message to know it
[1:20:22] to have heard it to grow up in it to
[1:20:24] attend the church
[1:20:27] we've got to come in contact with the
[1:20:29] living god
[1:20:31] we've got to get a hold of it we got to
[1:20:33] press
[1:20:34] hold uh uh whatever we have to do we
[1:20:37] have to wrestle with and overcome
[1:20:39] until until that that we got a hold of
[1:20:42] changes our lives so it changes our walk
[1:20:46] until it changes our name
[1:20:52] see when jesus was on this earth it
[1:20:55] wasn't the people
[1:20:57] that were casually you know in the
[1:21:00] marketplace when jesus walked by
[1:21:02] they didn't really get a whole lot but
[1:21:04] it was the blind bartimaeus who would
[1:21:05] cry out and keep crying out and when the
[1:21:08] others tried to get him quiet
[1:21:09] he would cry out the louder and jesus
[1:21:12] would turn to him
[1:21:13] it was the woman who would press her way
[1:21:15] through the crowd
[1:21:16] amen just to touch to him of his garment
[1:21:19] amen it was the four friends who would
[1:21:20] rip the roof off
[1:21:22] of a building and lower their friends in
[1:21:24] that got healing
[1:21:25] you realize friends this is when god
[1:21:27] came to jacob amen it wasn't as though
[1:21:29] god was disappointed when jacob got a
[1:21:31] hold of him
[1:21:33] amen god come to jacob
[1:21:37] and and god wasn't he wasn't angry with
[1:21:39] jacob
[1:21:41] the angel said turn me loose he said
[1:21:42] i'll not turn you loose
[1:21:44] until you bless me see we can't be
[1:21:48] casual about god we can't be casual
[1:21:51] about the word
[1:21:51] you can't you know blind bartimaeus
[1:21:53] couldn't have been sitting there when
[1:21:54] his opportunity came
[1:21:56] when god come by his way amen he could
[1:21:58] have sat there and said
[1:21:59] oh he didn't come very close maybe next
[1:22:01] time
[1:22:04] maybe maybe he'll pass back through the
[1:22:06] woman with the blood of you had caught a
[1:22:08] revelation and if i touch the hem of his
[1:22:09] garment
[1:22:10] she didn't look at the crowd and say oh
[1:22:12] i'll get trampled there's no way to get
[1:22:14] there i'm going to have to push and i'm
[1:22:15] going to have to fight
[1:22:16] i might wait to a more convenient time
[1:22:21] the friends who had the the lame men
[1:22:24] that they lowered on the mat
[1:22:25] you know they ripped up somebody's roof
[1:22:27] to do that amen
[1:22:28] they didn't think you know maybe we'll
[1:22:30] find a more convenient time we'll catch
[1:22:32] him out
[1:22:32] but no they they knew where god was they
[1:22:34] knew where god was working and they had
[1:22:36] to get there
[1:22:39] they had to get to him and i think we
[1:22:41] need the same kind of desire
[1:22:43] whatever it was in jacob amen what it
[1:22:45] was ever in those people who had to get
[1:22:46] to the lord
[1:22:47] we've got to get to him friends you
[1:22:49] young people you've got to get to him
[1:22:51] it's not good enough to come to this
[1:22:53] church every day of your life and pay
[1:22:54] your tithe and believe the message
[1:22:56] you've got to come in contact with the
[1:22:57] living god and when you get in contact
[1:22:59] with him you've got to aggressively get
[1:23:00] a hold of me
[1:23:01] and not turn loose and say you've got to
[1:23:03] change me i can't do this on my own i
[1:23:06] can't do with my intellect i can't do
[1:23:07] with my reasoning
[1:23:08] i have no ability to overcome i need you
[1:23:11] to change me
[1:23:17] don't wait for another opportunity or
[1:23:19] another day today is the day of
[1:23:21] salvation
[1:23:21] if he's here if you know he's here if
[1:23:24] his presence has come and touched you
[1:23:25] get a hold of him amen
[1:23:27] get ahold of him and don't turn him
[1:23:28] loose don't be casual about the message
[1:23:32] don't take it or leave it don't be
[1:23:33] casual don't put it off for the future
[1:23:35] but take it take it unto yourself devour
[1:23:38] it feed on it become one with it and be
[1:23:40] aggressive about it
[1:23:42] amen i've got to have a change
[1:23:48] i've got to have a change something has
[1:23:50] got to bring a
[1:23:51] change
[1:23:54] it's got to change
[1:23:57] my name and it's got to change
[1:24:01] my walk
[1:24:06] you know when god
[1:24:12] knew that simon was really a peter
[1:24:17] peter didn't know he was a peter he was
[1:24:19] all his life a simon
[1:24:22] but god knew he was a peter
[1:24:26] and because god knew he was a peter god
[1:24:29] would make sure
[1:24:30] he would get down close enough to where
[1:24:33] simon
[1:24:33] could recognize who he was
[1:24:37] and in the recognition of who he was he
[1:24:40] could turn around and change his name
[1:24:43] when he changed his name he changed his
[1:24:44] identity and he placed him
[1:24:47] saul didn't know he was paul
[1:24:51] right saul didn't know he was paul
[1:24:54] and saul amen saul was was was using his
[1:24:57] own intellect and his own reasonings and
[1:24:59] his own strengths
[1:25:00] and he was having great success in the
[1:25:02] jews religion and he was finding himself
[1:25:04] in great positions and
[1:25:05] in in in the jewish religion everything
[1:25:08] was working fine for saul
[1:25:10] but saul had had a flawed identity he
[1:25:13] had spiritual amnesia he thought he was
[1:25:15] saul
[1:25:15] the great zealous pharisee
[1:25:18] he didn't realize he was the apostle
[1:25:20] paul the light to the gentiles
[1:25:23] he was in the midst of identity crisis
[1:25:25] and didn't know it
[1:25:26] but the only one that could give him his
[1:25:27] true identity was a living
[1:25:29] a living god a present tense god
[1:25:34] could give him his identity and he made
[1:25:36] sure that he found
[1:25:38] he found palm simon didn't find jesus
[1:25:41] jesus found simon
[1:25:45] saul didn't find jesus jesus in the form
[1:25:47] of pillar of
[1:25:48] the pillar of fire found paul
[1:25:52] i asked your friends has he found you
[1:25:55] did you find him or did he find you amen
[1:25:58] why are you here
[1:25:59] why are you hearing the things that
[1:26:01] billions have not had the privilege to
[1:26:03] hear
[1:26:04] millions who have heard it have rejected
[1:26:05] it but you're here
[1:26:07] and something in you can recognize that
[1:26:09] there is a god here amen there's a
[1:26:11] present tense
[1:26:12] god here and it's the message of the
[1:26:14] hour
[1:26:15] it's the word of god he's here he's
[1:26:17] present i'm telling you friends get a
[1:26:19] hold of him amen
[1:26:20] don't wait for him to pass by another
[1:26:22] time don't wait for the crowd to get
[1:26:24] lighter don't wait for more convenient
[1:26:26] time
[1:26:26] if you've got to rip the roof off rip
[1:26:28] the roof off amen if you've got to miss
[1:26:30] a week of school and work to stay in
[1:26:31] your room and pray through
[1:26:32] amen get to him and get a hold of him
[1:26:36] until you know that something has
[1:26:38] changed my desires have changed my
[1:26:40] thinking has changed
[1:26:41] something in me has shifted gears
[1:26:45] i meant a new creation a new creature
[1:26:47] amen get a hold of him and say god
[1:26:49] changed me
[1:26:50] changed me changed me
[1:26:54] i don't want all my life to be a message
[1:26:56] believer
[1:27:00] i want to be one who's met a living god
[1:27:03] and got a hold of him and i want to be
[1:27:05] one who's wrestled with
[1:27:06] and prevailed
[1:27:10] god this is just brother chad but from
[1:27:13] reading the scriptures
[1:27:14] god was not ever looking for a casual
[1:27:16] believer to take it or leave it i think
[1:27:18] so maybe
[1:27:19] looks good to me i think it must be
[1:27:21] right where was that in the bible
[1:27:28] but he was looking for those that would
[1:27:30] press he was looking for those that
[1:27:32] would wrestle with and overcome
[1:27:33] those that would take a hold and not let
[1:27:35] go those that would say
[1:27:36] you must bless me you must heal me you
[1:27:38] must change me
[1:27:41] and i want to be that kind of believer
[1:27:42] amen if you're a young person here if
[1:27:44] you've never had that experience
[1:27:46] amen where you know something's changed
[1:27:47] amen press through and get ahold and say
[1:27:49] god
[1:27:50] i'm not letting go of this message i'm
[1:27:51] not letting go of you amen i'm staying
[1:27:53] right here until i know that you've
[1:27:55] changed me
[1:27:56] that i've met you and something has
[1:27:58] shifted on the inside and my desires
[1:28:00] have all turned heavenward
[1:28:07] i need you to change my walk
[1:28:11] change my wants my desires my thinking
[1:28:16] the things that are in my heart that
[1:28:18] nobody knows about but me they need to
[1:28:19] be changed
[1:28:23] they need to be changed and i need you
[1:28:26] to change my name
[1:28:30] in the message once more prophet of god
[1:28:34] says you say
[1:28:36] a name means nothing then why did he
[1:28:38] change
[1:28:39] abram's name to abraham why did james
[1:28:42] saul's name depaul
[1:28:44] simon's name to peter why did he change
[1:28:46] his own name
[1:28:48] why did he change jacob to israel not
[1:28:50] until he wrestled with the lord and not
[1:28:52] until he overcome
[1:28:53] and when jesus overcome death hell in
[1:28:55] the grave the bible said
[1:28:57] he had a new name and when jacob
[1:28:59] overcome
[1:29:00] and if the church can overcome she will
[1:29:02] stop saying
[1:29:03] i am methodist baptist presbyterian
[1:29:10] she will stop saying i'm a message
[1:29:12] believer
[1:29:14] she will stop saying i'm a member of
[1:29:16] this church and i'm a member of that
[1:29:18] church and i go to this and that church
[1:29:19] those aren't wrong things to say but if
[1:29:21] that's your identification it hasn't
[1:29:23] went deep enough
[1:29:27] so the church can overcome she will stop
[1:29:29] saying i'm methodist i'm baptist and
[1:29:30] presbyterian
[1:29:31] when she can overcome her creeds and the
[1:29:33] world that draws her
[1:29:34] there she'll come back to the bride of
[1:29:36] jesus christ
[1:29:38] misses jesus christ she will get a new
[1:29:41] name amen
[1:29:42] and that's not a name a preacher can
[1:29:44] give you amen that's not a name any
[1:29:45] human being can give you
[1:29:46] there's only one way to get that name
[1:29:48] change and that's when you come in
[1:29:49] contact with jesus christ himself and he
[1:29:52] tells you
[1:29:53] you are my bride
[1:29:56] and he changes your name and changing
[1:29:58] your name changes your identity
[1:30:00] changes your placing amen changes
[1:30:02] everything amen then you become
[1:30:05] mrs jesus christ
[1:30:09] his name is called the word of god what
[1:30:11] is the word of god today the word of god
[1:30:13] made flesh today
[1:30:14] is the bride is the manifestation of
[1:30:17] christ in bride form
[1:30:18] mrs jesus christ it is the word made
[1:30:21] flesh
[1:30:22] it is the identification of this day it
[1:30:24] is the identification of the hour
[1:30:26] it is our portion in the promised land
[1:30:28] and we must be birthed
[1:30:30] under that name
[1:30:34] jesus christ must come to us personally
[1:30:38] we must get a hold of him personally
[1:30:40] individually
[1:30:42] not a church not a group amen
[1:30:44] individually we must make contact with
[1:30:46] the living god and that living god has
[1:30:49] to do something has to touch us in a way
[1:30:51] that changes our lives changes our
[1:30:53] thinking changes our walk
[1:30:55] amen and changes our identification to
[1:30:58] now
[1:30:58] spiritual amnesia goes away and from
[1:31:00] that point on
[1:31:01] saul knew he was paul simon knew he was
[1:31:04] peter jacob knew he was israel
[1:31:06] and from that time on you'll know that
[1:31:08] you're the bride of jesus christ that
[1:31:10] you are
[1:31:11] mrs jesus christ not because somebody
[1:31:13] pointed at you from a pulpit and said it
[1:31:15] but because
[1:31:16] jesus christ in a personal meeting with
[1:31:18] him has told you he's whispered a love
[1:31:20] secret in your ear and he says you're
[1:31:22] one of them
[1:31:23] you're mine you belong to me and i'm
[1:31:25] marrying to you
[1:31:28] and then your identity changes your walk
[1:31:30] changes and you can say i
[1:31:31] am mrs jesus christ not because of what
[1:31:35] the
[1:31:35] you know brother branham come in the
[1:31:37] first seal and he says no i'm gonna
[1:31:39] i'm gonna call you bride he was making a
[1:31:43] declaration amen
[1:31:44] because every time there's a victory a
[1:31:46] name changes
[1:31:47] he said i no longer call you church i
[1:31:50] call you
[1:31:50] bride because there was a great victory
[1:31:53] that was taking place in the opening of
[1:31:54] the seals the lamb had done the
[1:31:56] mediatory work he had been the redeemer
[1:31:58] now he was coming forth the kingdom and
[1:32:00] redeemer to claim his redemption to
[1:32:02] unite with his bride
[1:32:03] there was a great victory taking place
[1:32:05] amen in revelations chapter 5.
[1:32:08] and in the first seal amen to denote
[1:32:10] that there's a great victory taking
[1:32:12] place he
[1:32:12] the prophet changes the name
[1:32:16] from church to bride
[1:32:20] and when he said that it was nothing but
[1:32:22] the truth
[1:32:24] but he was speaking to a category of
[1:32:26] people
[1:32:29] he was speaking to a category of people
[1:32:32] amen you need more than that
[1:32:37] you need jesus christ revealed
[1:32:39] personally
[1:32:40] to you you need it not
[1:32:44] a prophet who would teach that there's
[1:32:45] an invisible union but you need to come
[1:32:47] into an invisible union
[1:32:52] amen not just be surrounded by people in
[1:32:56] an invisible union
[1:32:57] but you yourself has had to go behind
[1:32:59] the veil
[1:33:01] and unite with a living jesus christ
[1:33:04] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:33:12] i'll tell you he's here
[1:33:18] where do i go to find him he's here
[1:33:21] he's hearing the revealing of his word
[1:33:22] he's hearing the message he's here
[1:33:24] the fullness of the holy ghost is here
[1:33:28] don't let him pass by
[1:33:31] don't wait for another day blind
[1:33:34] bartimaeus had one shot
[1:33:36] and he wasn't going to lose it
[1:33:40] the woman with the blood issue she had a
[1:33:42] revelation in her heart if i could just
[1:33:43] get to him it'll be well
[1:33:45] and she made sure she got to him
[1:33:49] this isn't the hour for passive religion
[1:33:53] this isn't the hour to sit back and say
[1:33:55] well i'm only 12 i'm only 13. i'm only
[1:33:57] 17. i
[1:33:58] i'm only it doesn't matter where you're

[1:34:09] god there's a god on the scene there's a
[1:34:11] present god here and he's coming in

[1:34:19] in contact with you and you know the
[1:34:21] presence of god is here
[1:34:22] are you going to let him pass by and
[1:34:23] look for a more convenient time

[1:34:41] now let's get a hold of him and let him
[1:34:42] identify us
[1:34:44] to us so we can see him in the mirror of
[1:34:47] his word and so we recognize who he is
[1:34:49] and let him tell us who we are
[1:34:53] that's the only way we'll get the proper
[1:34:55] identity for this day
[1:34:57] the only way amen those disciples who
[1:35:00] had a name change the only way they
[1:35:01] could get their true name
[1:35:02] amen was to come in contact with jesus
[1:35:04] christ
[1:35:05] and the only way for you to get your
[1:35:07] true name
[1:35:09] your real name is to come in contact
[1:35:12] with jesus christ
[1:35:15] you come in contact with him don't be
[1:35:17] passive
[1:35:20] don't say well he knows
[1:35:24] well he knows of course he knows he
[1:35:26] showed up when jacob was in a time of
[1:35:28] need
[1:35:29] who knew what who knew the most god or
[1:35:32] jacob
[1:35:35] he knows yeah he knows he he come by
[1:35:38] because there was a woman had needs to
[1:35:40] go by and samara he knew
[1:35:42] but she had to get a hold of something
[1:35:45] he knows that's why he comes by that's
[1:35:47] why he calls your name by revealing the
[1:35:49] mysteries that's why he woo's you with
[1:35:50] his love story
[1:35:51] with all his love secrets he's wooing
[1:35:53] you to himself he's here he's calling
[1:35:55] you he's calling you to himself
[1:35:57] he's drawing you by the revealing of the
[1:35:59] word he's present
[1:36:00] amen but he'll it's just like when he
[1:36:02] was on the water he come to the
[1:36:04] disciples walking in the water and he
[1:36:06] acted like he was going to walk by
[1:36:09] he was their deliverance he was their
[1:36:11] only choice for hope he was the only way
[1:36:13] that they could make it but he was going
[1:36:15] to act like he was going to pass by
[1:36:16] so that they would cry out
[1:36:21] when he was with him on the road to
[1:36:22] emmaus he was there and their hearts
[1:36:24] were burning within them as he spoke to
[1:36:26] them along the way
[1:36:27] and then they were in the contact with
[1:36:29] jesus christ and their hearts were
[1:36:31] burned they were having a reaction to
[1:36:32] the opening of the word
[1:36:35] and at the end of the day he acted like
[1:36:37] he would just go on
[1:36:40] but they compelled him and they implored
[1:36:42] him to come in
[1:36:46] see jesus christ is a gentleman he
[1:36:48] doesn't force his way on anybody
[1:36:50] he doesn't force his way on you but
[1:36:52] he'll pass by and he'll begin to break
[1:36:54] the word to you so that your heart
[1:36:55] begins to burn
[1:36:56] as he speaks to you along the way and
[1:36:58] then he'll act like he's just going to
[1:37:00] pass on
[1:37:00] and i might be back here wednesday and i
[1:37:02] might be back here next sunday
[1:37:08] but don't let him pass on today

[1:37:31] i want you to deliver me because i can't
[1:37:33] deliver myself
[1:37:36] don't let him pass by
[1:37:41] don't settle with a church name
[1:37:45] don't settle with the name of message
[1:37:47] believer
[1:37:49] message believer is not good enough
[1:37:53] the only name that gives the right
[1:37:55] identity is mrs jesus christ
[1:37:57] the bride of christ don't stop pressing
[1:38:01] till you have your identity
[1:38:03] don't stop pressing until you've
[1:38:05] something's changed something's shifted
[1:38:07] you know that whatever it was before is
[1:38:10] different now i think different i feel
[1:38:12] they're
[1:38:12] all my desires are different don't stop
[1:38:15] pressing
[1:38:17] little lily don't stop pushing
[1:38:21] little lily the sun is shining keep
[1:38:23] pressing towards the sun
[1:38:25] this is for young and old alike friends
[1:38:27] the sun is shining keep pressing for the
[1:38:29] sun
[1:38:30] don't be passive don't be trivial about
[1:38:33] it get aggressive amen
[1:38:35] it's time to get aggressive and say god
[1:38:38] i've got to have
[1:38:39] more of you i've had you in the past
[1:38:41] amen you you've given me an experience
[1:38:43] i've got a new birth experience but i
[1:38:45] want more i want something fresh

[1:38:59] you amen
[1:39:00] i want less of me and more of you i'm
[1:39:03] like a little lily pressing towards the
[1:39:04] lie
[1:39:05] i'm coming through the muddy water lord
[1:39:07] i'm pushing my way up i'm coming to the
[1:39:10] light
[1:39:12] there's a push and a pull
[1:39:16] not just a pull there's a pull and a
[1:39:19] push
[1:39:20] there's a magnetism
[1:39:23] god is drawing but there's
[1:39:27] lives or seed here that are magnetized
[1:39:29] to that draw
[1:39:31] and they're two forces coming together
[1:39:35] and those two forces coming together
[1:39:37] it's not passive friends
[1:39:39] it's aggressive and it doesn't mean you
[1:39:41] have to shout like blind bartimaeus for
[1:39:43] all to hear
[1:39:44] and it doesn't mean that you have to
[1:39:45] crawl on your hands and knees like the
[1:39:47] woman with the blood issue
[1:39:48] but however god has come in contact with
[1:39:51] you and however you get a hold of him
[1:39:53] just be sure of one thing that i've
[1:39:55] gotten a hold of him
[1:39:56] and i'm not turning him loose until he
[1:39:58] changes me
[1:39:59] it can be quiet it can be loud it could
[1:40:02] be today it can be months from today but
[1:40:04] just get a hold of it friends
[1:40:05] reach out and grab a holder and say lord
[1:40:08] this message is you
[1:40:09] you are present tense you are here and
[1:40:11] i'm grabbing a hold of you a living god
[1:40:13] today
[1:40:14] and i won't turn loose i will feed on
[1:40:16] this word i will give my life to this
[1:40:17] word i will wrap my arms around it until
[1:40:20] you change me
[1:40:25] then way too many people thought they
[1:40:28] were okay
[1:40:30] know about the message and know the
[1:40:32] details of the message know the
[1:40:34] timelines and
[1:40:35] and the quotes and then they find out
[1:40:37] there was not actually no change
[1:40:40] no identification because if he ever
[1:40:42] reveals your true identity to you into
[1:40:44] your name
[1:40:44] you don't walk away and call brother
[1:40:46] branham a liar
[1:40:49] and say it's all fallacy
[1:40:56] this is the time to wrestle
[1:40:59] and prevail

[1:41:43] uncovered himself
[1:41:48] and if we can break past the veil of
[1:41:49] traditions and break past the veil of

[1:41:52] we can see the mighty god unveiled
