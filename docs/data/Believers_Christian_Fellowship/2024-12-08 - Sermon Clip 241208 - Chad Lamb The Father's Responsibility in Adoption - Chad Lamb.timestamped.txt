[0:00] boy I tried him this way and I tried him
[0:03] that way I throwed him down Sick I put
[0:06] him under I stomped him I let the devil
[0:09] do everything to him he could do he came
[0:12] right back up
[0:14] again
[0:16] listen okay remember what adoption is
[0:19] the father wants this son to inherit
[0:22] either all the kingdom or a portion of
[0:24] the of the estate and so he gives him to
[0:27] the best tutor he can to bring the out
[0:30] into position to take the position he
[0:32] has for him so what does this best tutor
[0:34] do here's what he does I've throw him
[0:38] down sick I've put him under I've
[0:41] stomped on him I let the devil do
[0:43] everything to him I could do he came
[0:45] right back up
[0:47] again oh praise God you mean this
[0:50] Troublesome life that I've been living
[0:52] it isn't outside the desire of God it
[0:55] means it's part of God shaping me for
[0:57] the work he wants me to do it means this
[0:58] isn't a pointless series of a bunch of
[1:01] bad things happening in my life
[1:02] absolutely not friends it is ordained of
[1:06] God under the tutelage of the Holy Ghost
[1:08] and he's bringing us just as Jesus
[1:10] Christ was led to the Wilderness to be
[1:12] tempted of the devil God has a plan for
[1:15] us and a position we must fit into and
[1:17] we've got to learn how to follow the
[1:20] father's business and keep his
[1:21] instructions despite whatever happens to
[1:26] us you know what's so discouraging what
[1:29] becomes so discour enaging is trial
[1:30] after trial after trial with no
[1:33] purpose it's just an endless cycle of
[1:36] pain and confusion and
[1:41] disappointments but when the isav comes
[1:44] on when the word of God comes the clear
[1:46] away the crust off our eyes we don't see
[1:48] it as an endless cycle of pain and
[1:50] confusion and suffering we see it as a
[1:52] Godly plan to bring us into a great
[1:55] position he had for before the
[1:56] foundation of the world because if God's
[1:58] got to shape me in mold me to bring me
[2:01] to a body change to sit with him on his
[2:03] throne then I say God shape me God mold
[2:05] me if you got to stomp me down if you
[2:07] got to put me under if you got to cause
[2:09] rejection to come whatever Christ went
[2:11] through do you think we're not going to
[2:13] go
[2:14] through Jesus Christ and his pilgrimage
[2:16] he come down the the the the spirit
[2:18] descended like a dove claimed this
[2:21] vessel dwelt in the vessel what a
[2:23] glorious thing from then on it was
[2:25] nothing but
[2:27] trouble we don't even hear much about
[2:30] Jesus's life previous to his baptism and
[2:33] previous to his baptism we only have one
[2:35] little interjection and that's when he
[2:37] was 12 amen uh disputing with them in
[2:39] the temple amen but we we don't have any
[2:42] reason to believe that for 30 years it
[2:45] was like it was after after he was
[2:47] claimed as a son after amen he was
[2:50] infilled with the fullness of God after
[2:52] he was declared to be the son whom I'm
[2:54] well pleased we do have record of that
[2:56] life from then on and go read the record
[2:58] and tell me when did he have A Moment's
[3:03] Peace why he was being shaped molded
[3:07] tested proved because God had something
[3:10] wonderful and glorious for him to do
