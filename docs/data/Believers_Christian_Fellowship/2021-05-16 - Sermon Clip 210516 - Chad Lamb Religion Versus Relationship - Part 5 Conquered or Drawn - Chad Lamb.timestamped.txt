[0:00] he wants to come in you and he's pulling
[0:02] you out of egypt and bringing you into
[0:03] promises of word
[0:04] and he's giving you boundaries and that
[0:06] boundary is your own life amen
[0:08] and he wants to drive out all unbelief
[0:11] amen every bit of unbelief
[0:13] drive out of you so that he his word
[0:16] takes preeminence in you
[0:17] and when his word takes for a minute
[0:19] it's in you the light of god the life of
[0:21] god
[0:21] shines out from you and it becomes an
[0:23] attractant amen that will bring the
[0:25] elect
[0:26] to your light and you realize when god
[0:30] gave them commandments and got them
[0:31] the territory he wanted to bring
[0:33] everything under this
[0:35] territory subject to the word
[0:39] even by force
[0:43] but he never gave them permission to go
[0:46] outside of those boundaries
[0:48] and conquer another people and make them
[0:51] believers
[0:54] they were never to make converts by
[0:58] conquest
[1:03] they were make converts by light
[1:07] and becoming the light of the world they
[1:10] would
[1:10] draw people to the light when they come
[1:13] to the light they would be pointed to
[1:15] the source of the light
[1:16] which was the word of god given by god
[1:18] himself and then they could come in
[1:20] contact with the light
[1:22] but they were never instructed by god
[1:24] they were never given permission
[1:26] ever to go beyond these boundaries to go
[1:29] and conquer
[1:29] amen to go and conquer another nation
[1:32] and bring them
[1:33] into the faith that was forbidden
[1:36] because that is not
[1:38] god's plan
[1:41] but that is the denominational plan that
[1:43] comes from nimrod
[1:44] that's exactly what nimrod did nimrod
[1:47] because he was a mighty hunter before
[1:48] the lord he would go and conquer a city
[1:50] or establish another kingdom and he
[1:52] would bring it subject
[1:54] unto babel bring a subject into this
[1:56] false unity and religion
[1:58] by force amen but god is never wanting
[2:01] to use
[2:02] force to gather his elect he is always
[2:04] gathering his elect by the shining of
[2:06] light
[2:07] and the elect are attracted to light and
[2:09] they move to light by free moral
[2:11] agency this is god's plan to redeem his
[2:14] children
[2:16] and he wants to use you and he wants you
[2:18] to possess your vessel and he wants you
[2:20] to drive by force out of your mind
[2:22] out of your conscience out of your life
[2:24] anything that's contrary to the word
[2:26] and bring this vessel of yours subject
[2:28] to the entire word that the word has
[2:30] preeminence so that he can shine light
[2:33] and the light is the life of men
[2:38] and by that light it will attract
[2:41] the elect of god but never by
[2:45] conquest
