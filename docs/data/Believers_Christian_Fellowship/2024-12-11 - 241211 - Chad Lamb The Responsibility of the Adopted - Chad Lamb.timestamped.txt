[15:51] Bibles with me we'll turn to the book of
[15:53] Ephesians and um earlier today sister
[15:57] Jade Lyn was released and so so it's
[15:59] really exciting I think she's with her
[16:01] family this evening but we hope to see
[16:02] her uh this Sunday but there was a group
[16:05] who gathered together to go down there
[16:07] to welcome her when she got out and so I
[16:09] just want to say thank you to all you

[16:22] see her this weekend and uh it's a good
[16:24] day amen it's cold windy a little bit
[16:27] snowy but it's a good day amen warm
[16:30] nonetheless so we thankful for God for
[16:32] that let's look here at Ephesians
[16:34] chapter
[16:37] 1 verse 4 Ephesians 1
[16:41] verse4 according as he hath chosen Us in
[16:45] him before the foundation of the world
[16:48] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[16:49] before him in love having predestinated
[16:52] us unto the adoption of children by
[16:55] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[16:57] good pleasure of his will
[16:59] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[17:01] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[17:03] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[17:06] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[17:07] sins according to the riches of his
[17:09] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[17:12] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[17:14] known unto us the mystery of his will
[17:16] according to his good pleasure which he
[17:18] hath purposed in himself that in the
[17:21] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[17:23] might gather together in one all things
[17:26] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[17:28] which dra on Earth even in him in whom
[17:31] also we have obtained an inheritance
[17:35] being predestinated according to the
[17:36] purpose of him who worketh all things
[17:39] after the counsel of his own will that
[17:41] we should be to the praise of his glory
[17:44] who first trusted in Christ amen God
[17:47] bless you as you take your seats and
[17:49] keep this scripture open we're going to
[17:50] look at it again so we see that that uh
[17:54] we're going to continue on with the
[17:55] message of adoption uh last Sunday we
[17:58] talked about about the father's
[18:00] responsibility in adoption and that's
[18:02] what we're seeing here again that uh
[18:04] that God Almighty had a predestinated
[18:07] plan and it was according to the good
[18:09] pleasure of his will according to his
[18:10] desire according to his plan what he
[18:13] wanted and we're just so thankful that's
[18:15] what he wanted amen we find ourselves
[18:17] the recipient we find ourselves part of
[18:19] his predestinated plan and all we can
[18:21] say back to him is thank you almighty
[18:23] God Amen but there was one one part in
[18:26] here that I want to go back and look at
[18:28] again
[18:29] if we could go back to uh uh verse 7
[18:33] let's go back to verse 7 we just read a
[18:35] couple verses here in whom we have
[18:38] Redemption through his blood the
[18:39] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[18:40] riches of his grace wherein Heath
[18:43] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[18:44] Prudence having made known unto us the
[18:47] mystery of his will according to his
[18:49] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[18:51] himself in the adoption series brother
[18:54] brenon preaches in 1960 preaches four
[18:56] parts on adoption and he comes to this
[18:58] part and he and he did something with
[19:00] this scripture that I really liked he
[19:02] read in this scripture he says having
[19:04] made known unto us the mystery of his
[19:06] will amen and there's two ways to look
[19:08] at this you can say he made known unto
[19:10] us the mystery of his will that he was
[19:12] going to do all this work in Christ and
[19:14] that's true and that's wonderful and
[19:15] he's revealed that what the work of
[19:17] Christ was going to be from before the
[19:18] foundation of the world and that we were
[19:20] chosen in him before the foundation of
[19:22] the world and that through his blood we
[19:24] have found forgiveness of sins that's
[19:26] true but what brother bandham does in
[19:27] the adoption series is he makes it
[19:30] personal and he says having made known
[19:32] unto us the mystery of his will his will
[19:35] concerning our part in this program
[19:39] making known to us the mystery of his
[19:41] will not just what he was going to do
[19:43] for everybody else not just how he was
[19:45] going to redeem but the mystery of his
[19:47] will concerning me in these scriptures
[19:50] and Me In Christ and me in adoption amen
[19:54] and the question is has he revealed to
[19:55] you the mystery of his will amen has he
[19:58] revealed to you you the mystery of his
[19:59] will not just revealed his will but as
[20:01] he revealed to you the mystery of his
[20:03] will if so you find yourself Amen in his
[20:07] plan of adoption in his predestinated
[20:09] plan saying thank you God Almighty I'm
[20:11] so thankful that you've made known unto
[20:14] us personally the mystery of your will
[20:18] concerning
[20:20] us amen so last Sunday was the uh
[20:24] responsibility of the father in adoption
[20:26] and tonight I would just like to talk
[20:28] about the responsibility of the
[20:30] adopted so they have the responsibility
[20:33] of the father in adoption but what's the
[20:34] responsibility of those who are adopted
[20:37] amen and we know after going through uh
[20:40] uh the study that we did on Sunday that
[20:42] that adoption is positional placing it's
[20:45] taking a son who and we're talking Old
[20:47] Testament uh uh adoption now our
[20:50] adoption is the way brother brandham
[20:51] taught it as was done by the Greeks and
[20:53] by the Romans and the in the uh Biblical
[20:55] times he takes that adoption and that
[20:58] adoption is is an adoption of somebody
[21:00] who's already a child they're already
[21:02] born into a family but they come to a
[21:05] level of maturity where they can be
[21:06] positionally placed in the family and a
[21:08] place of responsibility or maybe
[21:11] responsibility over all the estate or
[21:13] responsibility over part of the estate
[21:14] but they're placed in the family given
[21:16] responsibility and they have and they
[21:19] have full sway in that area of
[21:21] responsibility that's the adoption that
[21:23] brother B's talking about that's the
[21:24] adoption that Galatians is speaking of
[21:27] and so now when want to look at what's
[21:29] the responsibility of those who are
[21:31] adopted those who've come to that
[21:33] position and I'd like to look at it
[21:35] through the Exodus Journey for tonight
[21:37] if we can so if you could turn back with
[21:38] me to the Book of
[21:41] Exodus and we're not uh we don't intend
[21:45] to take a long time tonight because we
[21:46] want to stay true to our our desire to
[21:51] not go too long but you know we'll do
[21:55] what we can do we just pray that God has
[21:58] his way amen so in Exodus
[22:02] 3:
[22:06] 7 he's speaking to Moses here in Exodus
[22:09] 3:
[22:11] 7 and the Lord said I have surely seen
[22:14] the Affliction of my people which are in
[22:16] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[22:18] of their task Masters for I know their
[22:20] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[22:23] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[22:25] and to bring them up out of that land
[22:27] into a good land
[22:29] and a large and to a land flowing with
[22:31] milk and honey unto the place of the
[22:33] Canaanites and the Hittites and the
[22:35] amorites and the parasites and the
[22:37] hivites and the jebusites now therefore
[22:40] Behold The Cry of the children of Israel
[22:42] has come unto me and I have also seen
[22:44] the oppression wherewith the Egyptians
[22:46] have oppressed them come now therefore
[22:49] and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that
[22:51] thou mayest bring forth my people the
[22:53] children of Israel out of Egypt so God
[22:56] is going to come down now to fulfill the
[22:59] promise that he gave to Abraham and he
[23:01] promised Abraham that his children
[23:03] should inherit the land the land was
[23:04] given to Abraham and the inheritance was
[23:07] for for Abraham's seed and now they're
[23:09] trapped in bondage which God had
[23:11] prophesied they would be there but he
[23:13] would bring them out with a mighty hand
[23:14] now when it's time for God to bring them
[23:16] out in The Exodus Journey he sends Moses
[23:18] he says I've come down to deliver them
[23:21] now come I'm sending you and God was
[23:23] right there working with Moses and
[23:25] through Moses in that Ministry
[23:27] delivering his children
[23:28] amen and then we see in The Exodus
[23:30] Journey as they the children of Israel
[23:33] were were receiving their Deliverance
[23:35] amen through this messenger through this
[23:38] uh Prophet that God had sent to them
[23:40] amen everything was being done by the
[23:42] Prophet The Prophet was fulfilling the
[23:45] prophecies he was bringing deliverance
[23:47] and that's the vessel that God was using
[23:48] in that day but everything was being
[23:51] done through Moses I mean the plagues
[23:52] were coming through Moses everything was
[23:54] happening Moses was speaking to Pharaoh
[23:57] Moses was bringing the plagues Moses was
[23:59] calling for flies Moses was turning the
[24:01] water into blood uh Moses was doing it
[24:04] all amen and the children of Israel
[24:05] weren't doing
[24:07] anything and then they came out with a
[24:09] mighty hand they were sent out by
[24:11] pharaoh and they go out and they they've
[24:13] spoiled the Egyptians and they go out
[24:15] and then they come to their first real
[24:17] test at the Red Sea when they're wedged
[24:19] into the Red Sea and hemmed in with no
[24:21] Escape Route and the army of pharaoh
[24:23] comes down they begin to cry and
[24:25] complain to Pharaoh amen it's
[24:27] interesting not to pharaoh to Moses it's
[24:30] interesting because Moses did everything
[24:32] now when they get in trouble they start
[24:34] complaining against
[24:36] Moses and and we we've said this before
[24:39] but we'll say it again they're standing
[24:41] there at the edge of the Red Sea they
[24:43] and their children and all their family
[24:45] have fine silk garments chains around
[24:47] their necks gold and all the gold they
[24:49] can pack because Egypt's just been
[24:51] destroyed amen they they're now spoiling
[24:54] Egypt they've got all all the gold and
[24:56] all the coins and all the jewelry and
[24:58] all the garments and all the vessels
[25:00] that they can possibly carry and they're
[25:02] standing here with all this loot where
[25:03] they've just looted Egypt and now
[25:06] because they're at the Red Sea and
[25:07] they're coming they forgot all that
[25:08] happened amen they start crying out to
[25:10] Moses look what you've done you've
[25:12] brought us out here to be killed and all
[25:13] of these things happen and then Moses
[25:16] turns to the Red Sea and he cries out to
[25:18] God and God says why cry cries unto me
[25:21] speak that the children moved forward
[25:23] and he raised his rod and and parted the
[25:25] waters and they went across on dry
[25:27] ground and this is how The Exodus
[25:29] journey goes they go a little ways and
[25:31] they finally come to the the the bitter
[25:33] Waters and the bitter Waters now they
[25:35] have nothing to drink and they begin to
[25:37] murmur and
[25:38] complain who do they murmur and complain
[25:40] against
[25:42] Moses because obviously Moses is doing
[25:45] everything so every every success we see
[25:48] Moses doing every failure is Moses's
[25:50] fault too because Moses has to take care
[25:51] of
[25:53] us so he cuts a branch throws it in the
[25:56] water turns the bitter water swe s they
[25:58] move on they run out of bread when they
[26:00] run out of bread who do they cry against
[26:02] Moses who calls unto God and brings them
[26:04] bread and Mana from Heaven Moses then
[26:06] they they get hungry for meat they cry
[26:08] against Moses and Moses cries to God and
[26:11] that now Mana comes they get thirsty
[26:13] again amen and now he brings water from
[26:15] the rock it's it's this way all down
[26:18] through the Exodus Journey they're
[26:19] dependent upon Moses for
[26:22] everything and I would like to look at
[26:25] Exodus
[26:26] 17 we'll just turn there and I want to
[26:29] show this as an
[26:39] example Exodus
[26:42] 17 and let's start with verse
[26:45] eight says then came amalec and fought
[26:49] with Israel and riid them and Moses said
[26:52] unto Joshua choose us out men and go out
[26:55] fight with amalec to tomorrow tomorrow I
[26:58] will stand on top of the hill with the
[27:00] rod of God in my hand so Joshua did as
[27:03] Moses had said to him and fought with
[27:05] amalec and Moses Aaron and her went up
[27:07] to the top of the hill and it came to
[27:10] pass when Moses held up his hand that
[27:11] Israel prevailed and when he let down
[27:13] his hand AMC prevailed but moses' hands
[27:17] were heavy and they took a stone and put
[27:19] it under him and he sat thereon and
[27:21] Aaron and her stayed up his hands the
[27:23] one on the one side and the other on the
[27:25] other side and his hands were steady
[27:27] until the going down of the Sun and
[27:29] Joshua discomforted amalec and his
[27:32] people with the edge of the sword so we
[27:35] see this story where amalec comes out to
[27:37] fight him they go to fight against them
[27:39] amen but Moses goes to the top of the
[27:41] hill with the rod of God and he holds up
[27:42] as long as moses' hands are extended
[27:44] they're winning the battle the minute
[27:46] his hands begin to drop amalec begins to
[27:49] overcome them in the battle so even
[27:51] their Victory on the battlefield is
[27:53] completely dependent on the strength of
[27:55] Moses they're dependent on the position
[27:58] Moses with the rod am mean everything is
[28:00] based on the strength and position of
[28:02] Moses when Moses falters they falter
[28:05] when Moses rises again they rise again
[28:07] until they finally set him down and prop
[28:10] up his hands so that they can win the
[28:11] victory but it's completely dependent
[28:13] upon
[28:14] Moses amen but before they go into the
[28:17] promised land which is their inheritance
[28:19] which when they come into their adoption
[28:21] when their positionally placed under
[28:22] Joshua Ministry in the promised land
[28:25] that is the adoption of Israel so God
[28:27] has rescued the them and brought them
[28:28] out of Egypt to bring them to adoption
[28:31] which is what positional
[28:33] placing so on the way to positional
[28:36] placing God brings them all along the
[28:38] journey amen till they come to Jordan
[28:40] till they come to the time to cross over
[28:42] and just before they cross over God does
[28:44] something that's very important when it
[28:46] comes to adoption he removes
[28:49] Moses because they were dependent upon
[28:52] Moses for everything but when they cross
[28:54] into the land it's going to be different
[28:55] than the way it was in The Exodus
[28:57] Journey God is looking for a different
[28:59] manifestation this is a different phase
[29:01] of the journey now the Israelites
[29:03] themselves are moving into an adopted
[29:05] position a positional placing in the
[29:07] inheritance of God and God Amen in his
[29:11] Sovereign Grace he takes Moses away amen
[29:13] so he can bring them to a higher
[29:16] position he can position them in what he
[29:18] had thought of them before the
[29:19] foundation of the world and the place
[29:21] where he wanted to place
[29:23] them
[29:25] amen let's go to Deuteronomy now
[29:35] Deuteronomy chapter
[29:45] 11 Deuteronomy
[29:48] 11 verse 8 this is Moses giving
[29:51] instructions again to the nation of
[29:54] Israel and he says therefore it's 11:8
[29:57] therefore shall you keep all the
[29:59] Commandments which I command you this
[30:00] day that you may be strong and go in and
[30:03] possess the land whether you go to
[30:05] possess
[30:06] it and that you may prolong your days in
[30:09] the land which the Lord swear unto your
[30:11] fathers to give unto them to their seed
[30:13] a land that floweth with milk and honey
[30:16] for the land whether thou goest in to
[30:18] possess it is not as the land of Egypt
[30:20] from whence you came out where thou
[30:22] seest the seed and wat it with the foot
[30:24] as a garden of herbs but the land
[30:26] whether thou go to possess it is a land
[30:27] of hills and valleys of drinking water
[30:29] and of rain and of Heaven let's skip
[30:32] down to verse
[30:33] 22 for if you shall diligently keep all
[30:36] these Commandments which I command you
[30:38] to do them to love the Lord your God to
[30:40] walk in all of his ways and to cleave
[30:42] unto him then will the Lord drive out
[30:45] all these nations from before you and
[30:47] you shall possess greater Nations and
[30:49] mightier than yourselves every place
[30:51] wherein The Souls of your feet shall
[30:53] tread shall be yours from the Wilderness
[30:56] and Lebanon from the river the Riv
[30:58] Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea
[30:59] shall your Coast be there shall no man
[31:02] be able to stand before you for the Lord
[31:04] your God shall lay the fear of you and
[31:06] the dread of you upon all the land that
[31:08] you shall tread upon as he hath said
[31:11] unto you so as Moses gives him the
[31:14] instructions he also gives him the
[31:15] promise he said you're going to a land
[31:17] that's flowing with milk and honey and
[31:19] he says this you're going to possess
[31:23] it uh I love the terminology and I I
[31:26] just just just stay with with me for a
[31:28] minute he says you're going to possess
[31:29] it the land you go to possess not the
[31:32] land you go to inhabit the land you go
[31:35] to
[31:35] possess the whole thing is talking about
[31:38] a possession because they're going to
[31:39] have to go possess this land they're
[31:41] going to have to go take this land and
[31:43] he said everywhere the souls you feat
[31:45] shall tread that have I given to you and
[31:47] this is where brother Bram comes with
[31:48] the statement footsteps are possession
[31:50] amen God says I've given it to you when
[31:52] you take it I've given it to you when
[31:54] you possess it you're going in to
[31:55] possess it I'll drive back the
[31:57] inhabitant when you go to possess it
[31:59] I'll put the fear and dread of them when
[32:01] you go to possess it but there's a
[32:03] stipulation here I'll drive them back
[32:05] when you go to possess it amen it'll
[32:07] become yours when you walk upon
[32:10] it remember they're coming to adoption
[32:13] to positional
[32:14] placing amen now let's go to Joshua
[32:18] Joshua chapter 1 because Joshua is going
[32:20] to reiterate
[32:22] this to the Jews just before they go
[32:25] in Joshua chapter 1
[32:32] so that's moses' instructions now we're
[32:34] here uh uh at the banks of Jordan and
[32:37] getting ready to cross into the land
[32:39] Moses is gone and Joshua now is is is
[32:43] going to lead them in Joshua 1 vers one
[32:46] now after the death of Moses the servant
[32:48] of the Lord it came to pass that the
[32:50] Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun
[32:52] Moses's Minister saying Moses my servant
[32:55] is dead now therefore arise go go over
[32:58] this Jordan thou and all this people and
[33:00] the land which I do give to them even to
[33:02] the children of Israel every place that
[33:04] the soul of your foot shall tread upon
[33:07] that have I given to you as I said unto
[33:09] Moses from the Wilderness and this
[33:11] Lebanon even into the Great River the
[33:13] river Euphrates all the land of the
[33:14] Hittites and unto the great sea toward
[33:16] the going down of the sun shall be your
[33:18] Coast there shall not any man be able to
[33:21] stand before thee all the days of thy
[33:23] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[33:25] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[33:27] forsake be strong and of good courage
[33:29] For unto this people shalt thou divide
[33:31] for an inheritance the land which I
[33:33] swear unto their fathers to give them
[33:35] only be thou strong and very courageous
[33:37] that thou mayest observe to do according
[33:39] to all the law which Moses my servant
[33:42] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[33:44] right hand or to the left that thou
[33:46] mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest
[33:50] now verse 10 then Joshua commanded the
[33:53] officers of the people saying pass
[33:56] through the host and command the people
[33:58] saying prepare you V viddles for within
[34:01] 3 days you shall pass over this Jordan
[34:03] to go in to possess the land which the
[34:05] Lord your God giveth you to possess it
[34:09] so now God speaks to Joshua and he
[34:11] brings the commission to Joshua what
[34:13] Moses had already instructed Israel he
[34:15] re he reiterates it to Joshua and he's
[34:17] saying the the where the souls of your
[34:19] feet shall go I have given it to you and
[34:22] then Joshua tells the people to prepare
[34:24] yourself to go over Jordan Amen to
[34:27] possess the
[34:29] land to possess the land so their their
[34:33] instructions are to go over Jordan to
[34:35] possess the
[34:37] land all right in adoption part one this
[34:40] is the adoption series we've been
[34:41] talking about from 1960 says our
[34:44] Ephesians are Joshua which is the holy
[34:46] spirit Joshua means Jesus Savior it
[34:48] means Jehovah savior it's the same Jesus
[34:50] and Joshua are the same word amen uh uh
[34:54] uh ones in the Old Testament ones in the
[34:55] New Testament but they have the same
[34:56] meaning Joshua means Jes Jesus Savior
[34:59] Jehovah savior Joshua means the Holy
[35:02] Spirit representing it in the spiritual
[35:04] as they was in the natural that he is
[35:06] our great warrior he is our great leader
[35:08] as God was with Joshua so God and in the
[35:11] Holy Spirit moving us about so now as
[35:14] they go to possess the land God has
[35:16] taken the prophet away but now Joshua
[35:19] the Holy Ghost is going to lead them in
[35:21] to the inheritance into the promise into
[35:24] what the prophet had led them to now the
[35:26] holy spirit is going to lead them into
[35:28] it divide it up amongst them and have
[35:30] them possess it and he divided to them
[35:33] the inheritance according to what Moses
[35:36] had already constructed him and he did
[35:38] it according to the word of Moses he
[35:40] didn't do it any ways different than
[35:42] what the prophet has said and this Holy
[35:44] Ghost is when as he's as he's dividing
[35:46] the land he's doing it exactly according
[35:48] to the instructions of the Prophet
[35:49] according to the prophet's Vision
[35:51] according to the word of God through the
[35:52] prophet and now he's here to make sure
[35:55] that the people get their portion amen
[35:57] make sure he leads them into that and he
[36:00] tells them this is where you belong and
[36:02] this is where you belong and this is
[36:03] where you belong and brother bham said
[36:05] that's the work of the Holy Ghost in the
[36:06] church today to give gifts and give
[36:08] callings and positionally place Us in
[36:10] the body of
[36:11] Christ his job is to say you belong here
[36:14] and lead you to your position and you
[36:16] belong here and I've called you for this
[36:17] and I've gifted you with this and I'm
[36:19] using you for this that's the work of
[36:21] the Holy Ghost that's the Joshua
[36:22] Ministry placing Us in the body placing
[36:25] Us in the land Amen to possess
[36:29] it
[36:31] amen praise
[36:34] God but brother B says it and this is
[36:37] interesting the way he goes through this
[36:38] in adoption because he's typing he he
[36:40] through much of the adoption he's typing
[36:42] the entrance to the promised land with
[36:44] adoption with our adoption in the
[36:45] placing in the church and he's going all
[36:47] through there and tying it together and
[36:49] he says positionally placing the church
[36:51] where they belong each one how we're
[36:53] called by the adoption God has adopted
[36:56] us to the to Sons we are Sons by birth
[36:59] adopted and positionally placed by the
[37:00] Holy Spirit look they were everyone
[37:03] Hebrews when they crossed that River but
[37:06] Joshua divided the land and give each
[37:07] one his land according to the utterance
[37:10] of his mother at his birth where the
[37:12] Holy Spirit told her oh so interesting I
[37:16] love the way brother Benham says that
[37:17] and I don't even know if I fully
[37:19] understand what he's saying but but
[37:20] there's a portion of it that come alive
[37:22] to me he says again and whyatt had to be
[37:24] Shepherds from 64 he said there's a
[37:26] great lesson that time I hope to be able
[37:28] to bring at this at Tucson of those
[37:31] Hebrew mothers giving birth to those
[37:32] babies when she groaned at the birth
[37:34] pain of the baby she called the name of
[37:36] the baby and that positionally placed it
[37:39] in the promised land its
[37:41] tribe so now all the sudden it is as the
[37:45] mothers and the Hebrew mothers are
[37:46] groaning under the birth pains to bring
[37:48] forth this child it's birthed to a
[37:51] position it's born for a position and
[37:54] that position is determined by what
[37:56] tribe it's born in so the tribe it's
[37:58] born I don't know exactly what she
[38:00] uttered but the name of the tribe would
[38:02] have always been part of the uhh uh part
[38:04] of the utterance for the child it's born
[38:06] into a certain tribe into a certain
[38:08] family and a certain strain and it
[38:10] dictates where it belongs in the land by
[38:14] where by by its birth amen and listen
[38:16] our birth dictates where we belong in
[38:19] the land as well because we're not born
[38:21] under the Methodist Revival we're not
[38:22] born under the Pentecost but we're born
[38:24] under the message of the hour and that
[38:27] position positions us in our tribe in
[38:29] the land under our messenger for our day
[38:31] to position us where back to the full
[38:34] inheritance of the full
[38:36] word praise be to God and the Holy Ghost
[38:39] is putting them in place according to
[38:43] their
[38:44] birth they were ordained to a place we
[38:47] are also ordained to a
[38:50] place let's go to Joshua chapter 5
[39:00] Joshua chapter
[39:04] 5 and verse
[39:06] 10 and the children of Israel encamped
[39:09] in gilgal and kept the Passover on the
[39:11] 14th day of the month at even in the
[39:13] plains of Jericho they did eat of the
[39:16] old corner of the land on the tomorrow
[39:18] after the Passover Passover unleavened
[39:21] cakes and parch corn in the selfsame day
[39:24] and the Mana ceased on the marrow after
[39:26] they had eaten of the old old corn of
[39:27] the land neither had the children of
[39:29] Israel Mana anymore but they did eat of
[39:32] the fruit of the land of Canaan that
[39:35] year what a what a statement they had
[39:39] all along the Wilderness Journey
[39:40] remember in the wilderness Journey Moses
[39:42] did everything is that right and they
[39:45] had Mana that fell every night and every
[39:47] morning they would go and gather up the
[39:49] supply for that day and water was
[39:51] provided and Direction was provided
[39:53] instruction was provided judgment the
[39:55] settling of disputes everything was
[39:57] provided by
[39:59] Moses but when they crossed over Jordan
[40:02] amen the next day the Mana ceased
[40:04] there's no more Mana it's time to grow
[40:06] up friends this is adoption time amen
[40:08] he's not going to be babied or petted
[40:10] anymore now it's time to possess the
[40:13] land and it says then they ate of the
[40:15] old corn uh old corn of the land when
[40:18] they spped in and took possession of the
[40:19] land it had fruits amen and it had crops
[40:22] amen they ate those crops and what a
[40:24] jubilee that was they had parched corn
[40:27] that means they had barley they had they
[40:28] had the fruit off the trees they had
[40:30] whatever vegetables were coming up in
[40:31] the garden as they drove the inhabitants
[40:33] they ate of the land that year and that
[40:35] was a wonderful year that was a jubilee
[40:38] it was a Revival they had stepped into
[40:40] the
[40:41] word but guess what it stopped that year
[40:44] the next year if they wanted parched
[40:46] corn and they wanted fruit if they
[40:47] wanted figs they were going to have to
[40:49] plant seeds and they were going to have
[40:51] to keep the land because they were
[40:52] moving into adoption to where they had
[40:55] to till the land
[40:57] totally different phase of the journey
[40:59] now they're coming into adoption if they
[41:02] want to eat parched corn they're going
[41:04] to have to plant
[41:06] barle right they're going to have to
[41:08] keep the cattle off The Barley they're
[41:11] going to have to keep enemies away
[41:12] they're going to have to make sure it's
[41:13] cultivated make sure it grows they're
[41:15] going to have to grow whatever other
[41:16] crops they want to grow if they want
[41:18] wine they have to tend The Vineyards
[41:20] they've got to do the work because now
[41:22] we've moved into adoption God's taken
[41:24] Moses away now it's not now it's not
[41:26] even Joshua was not going to plant your
[41:28] garden Joshua was going to tell you
[41:29] where your garden is but you're going to
[41:31] plant your garden Joshua was going to
[41:33] tell you your portion your place your
[41:35] gift where you belong in the body but
[41:38] Joshua is not going to come along and do
[41:39] all the work for you Joshua is going to
[41:41] instruct you on where you belong but
[41:43] once you belong there it's up to you to
[41:46] work that piece of
[41:48] land this is the responsibility of the
[41:54] adopted amen
[41:58] praise God remember Moses told them the
[42:01] Lord your God is leading you to a land
[42:04] that flows with milk and
[42:06] honey we remember we talked about this a
[42:08] couple years ago we preached on it it's
[42:10] quite humorous when you think about it
[42:12] because you can you imagine Crossing
[42:14] Jordan and running up to the first
[42:16] little stream you see and peeking over
[42:18] and there's no
[42:20] milk but the land flows with milk and
[42:23] honey
[42:27] you hear about a spring over the brook
[42:29] over the hill you go over the hill you
[42:30] go to a spring it's bubbling up and you
[42:33] expect to find
[42:35] honey and all it is is
[42:38] water a land flowing with milk and honey
[42:41] shows that the milk and honey the
[42:43] potential is in the
[42:45] land the land is a fruitful land it's
[42:49] got land for grazing it's got flowers
[42:52] you so you can have bees so you can make
[42:54] honey so you can graze uh your you can
[42:57] graze your cow you can graze your goat
[42:59] so that you can get your milk so when he
[43:00] says you're taking you to a land that
[43:02] flows with milk and honey he's not
[43:04] taking them to a place where they go out
[43:06] every morning and take their little Tin
[43:08] Cup and they scoop up some milk right
[43:10] out of the stream and they drink it with
[43:11] their bread it's not like that the milk
[43:13] and Honey's in the land but they've got
[43:16] to work the land to get the milk and
[43:17] honey out of the land because this is
[43:24] adoption praise God
[43:29] when the when the boy we talked about
[43:31] Sunday when the boy is under the
[43:33] tutelage of the Holy Ghost and he's
[43:35] being raised and taught and trained how
[43:37] to be and managed like his father how to
[43:41] think and interact and and make
[43:43] decisions like the father would and he
[43:45] finally comes to a time of adoption and
[43:47] the father adopts him and he gives him a
[43:49] portion or he gives him all or whatever
[43:51] he wants to give him of the estate and
[43:54] he says now says he's adopted into the
[43:56] family he got rights what he says go and
[43:59] I've given him this responsibility when
[44:01] the father gives him that responsibility
[44:03] amen when he brings him to adoption and
[44:05] gives him that responsibility he's
[44:07] telling them I trust you to go make
[44:09] decisions you've been tested you've been
[44:11] proved you've come to
[44:13] adoption amen
[44:17] so stop bothering me with what I you
[44:20] should do every decision make some
[44:22] decisions manage the portion I gave you
[44:25] to manage I trust you to do it I've
[44:27] brought you to this I've trained you for
[44:29] this you've matured into this this is
[44:31] for you to do amen
[44:35] am
[44:38] amen adoption isn't this place of
[44:40] privilege that we come to where all of a
[44:43] sudden everything's easy everything's
[44:44] kosher no adoption is a higher level of
[44:50] responsibility not a not a cozy comfy
[44:54] position adoption now is you have to
[44:57] make the
[44:59] decisions you decide what to plant you
[45:02] decide when to sell you decide how to do
[45:06] and then you have to live with your
[45:10] decisions when it comes to adoption we
[45:13] have to get to the place where we
[45:14] understand that I'm responsible for a
[45:16] few things in life if I'm a man with a
[45:18] family I'm responsible for my family if
[45:20] God's given me a gift I'm responsible to
[45:22] minister that gift there's places and
[45:24] positions we're responsible for those
[45:26] positions and if I take responsibility
[45:28] for that position I can't keep looking
[45:30] to Moses say Moses you tell me what to
[45:32] do Moses you do this and Moses you do
[45:35] that because all I'm trying to do is
[45:37] find somebody to take responsibility for
[45:39] me so if it doesn't work out I have
[45:41] somebody to
[45:43] blame that's not how it works friends
[45:46] God has asked us to take some
[45:48] responsibility God has asked us to come
[45:50] to maturity so what so that we can act
[45:52] like him on this Earth amen so that we
[45:55] can get some obstacles and and difficult
[45:57] situation so that we can make decisions
[45:59] according to his word to do what he
[46:02] would do in that situation and when we
[46:04] blow it and when we mess up because
[46:06] we've come to adoption we've come to
[46:08] adoption and we've been given the ring
[46:09] we've been given the checkbook we've
[46:11] been given the responsibility we've been
[46:12] given the authority now when we make a
[46:15] poor decision and blow it now we can't
[46:17] say well Moses well Moses is gone amen
[46:19] Moses didn't make that decision you did
[46:22] you can't say well Josh no no no this is
[46:24] you now and your inheritance now you
[46:26] have to say say I messed
[46:29] up that's what the adopted son has to do
[46:32] he has to say I messed this up this is
[46:35] all
[46:36] me but because I'm responsible I'll fix
[46:40] it God
[46:43] Amen this is spiritual maturity
[46:47] friends not everything that happens we
[46:49] just blame somebody else it's their
[46:52] fault no this is God gave me a right to
[46:55] make a decision he gave me a place in a
[46:57] position and I blew it I blew it with my
[47:00] family I got mad the other day and my
[47:02] wife I I I sniffed at the kids I did I
[47:04] blew it that was my fault I'm not
[47:06] blaming anybody else it's my fault yes
[47:09] but it's also my responsibility to make
[47:12] it
[47:13] right so I'm going to fix it if I
[47:16] planted the wrong crop and the wrong
[47:17] season and we all and my and my Harvest
[47:20] failed that means next year I'm going to
[47:22] have to plant the right crop in the
[47:24] right season and hopefully learn from my
[47:25] mistake but it's my responsibility am
[47:30] amen
[47:34] amen praise
[47:36] God you know it seems to me like we
[47:38] always want the
[47:41] Privileges but we never want the
[47:44] responsibility everybody wants
[47:46] privileges like kids always want
[47:48] privileges of getting older the
[47:49] privilege of driving the privilege of
[47:51] this the privilege of staying up till
[47:54] 10:00 we want the privilege es but we
[47:58] always we don't always want the
[47:59] responsibility that comes along with the
[48:02] Privileges
[48:06] amen oh praise God I want to move

[48:13] message the son of David have mercy on

[48:26] out and garnish the houses and hang up
[48:28] the curtains and everything you all just

[48:51] property but you'll fight every inch of
[48:54] it you mean Divine Healing belongs to me

[48:59] Divine Healing you mean it's not just
[49:01] simple it's not just no friends we got
[49:03] to press into these things sometimes but
[49:05] he says it belongs to you but you'll

[49:12] brother footsteps is possession just
[49:14] keep fighting take it the devil say the
[49:16] days of Miracles has passed you say
[49:18] you're a liar God said he's the same
[49:20] yesterday today and forever take it over
[49:22] everywhere your footsteps that's
[49:24] possession that's right amen deny the
[49:27] lies of the devil and bring the word
[49:30] resist the devil and he will flee who
[49:32] resist you resist amen don't ask
[49:34] everybody else to resist for you this is
[49:37] your land your inheritance your word and
[49:39] our inheritance is this word that's been
[49:41] given to us and we're here to fully
[49:43] possess every word that's what we're
[49:45] here to
[49:47] do not asking everybody else will you
[49:50] press will you press I mean there's
[49:51] times we need prayer support there's
[49:52] times we need help we need a body and
[49:54] there was times when they moved in to
[49:56] the promised land amen that sometimes
[49:59] the enemy was a little too much for them
[50:00] and there was a time in the scriptures
[50:02] in the Book of Judges where the enemy
[50:04] was a bit too much for One Tribe and
[50:05] they asked Judah to come help and Judah
[50:07] came and helped and they pushed him back
[50:09] and once Judah pushed him back Judah
[50:10] went back to his land and then this
[50:13] tribe continued to work their land and
[50:14] drive out the
[50:16] inhabitants there are times that we need
[50:18] help but there no there's no time that
[50:21] we ever go on vacation and ask Judah to
[50:23] clean them off and when you get it all
[50:24] situated we'll come back no friends
[50:27] sometimes we help one another but we've
[50:29] got to be the one driving back the enemy
[50:31] we've got to be the one resisting the
[50:33] devil cuz the promise is resist the
[50:34] devil and he shall
[50:37] flee that's something for us to
[50:40] do Amen in the message the comforter
[50:43] this is where he says the word is our
[50:45] inheritance said I live by the word
[50:47] Jesus said it's written man shall not
[50:49] live by bread alone but by every word
[50:51] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[50:53] and this is it and that is given to us
[50:56] as a Heritage it's our inheritance the
[50:59] word amen so what is Our Land what is
[51:01] our what is our what is our inheritance
[51:04] it's this word that's been delivered to
[51:09] us and just like for Israel in The
[51:14] Exodus when they all moved into their
[51:17] portion they were all there to subdue
[51:21] the land and bring the land under
[51:25] control of God and under the word of
[51:28] God because God had given Moses
[51:30] instructions on how to live upon the
[51:32] land Moses told him every seven years
[51:36] have a rest he told them what to do for
[51:38] the years of Jubilee He told them how to
[51:40] bring a tithe he told them how to
[51:42] worship God he told them the feast to
[51:44] keep he told them how to how to resolve
[51:46] differences he told them how to set up
[51:48] the priesthood he told them how to deal
[51:50] with each other in neighborly ways amen
[51:52] Moses gave the word concerning their
[51:55] life in the land and now it was their
[51:58] job to bring that word to life in this
[52:01] land amen and they were each one
[52:04] responsible for it because everybody had
[52:06] to keep their part of the word to bring
[52:09] that land which was not hittite land and
[52:12] Canaanite land neither was it Israel
[52:14] land it was God's land God said this is
[52:16] my land but I've given it to you to
[52:19] possess and so who were they possessing
[52:21] it for they were possessing it for God
[52:24] Amen and what were they supposed to do
[52:25] they were supposed to bring bring that
[52:27] land subdued and subjection to the word
[52:30] of God that was their goal that was what
[52:34] they were supposed to
[52:36] do
[52:39] Amen brother bam said in the message
[52:41] perseverance said but every promise in
[52:44] the Bible is yours but you'll have to
[52:47] fight every devil guard away from it
[52:50] with a two-edged sword and claim it for
[52:52] yourself be persistent walk right into
[52:55] it
[52:56] man let's go back to Joshua here and
[52:58] look at Joshua chapter 10
[53:03] together and before we read the the
[53:06] scripture I want to read I want to
[53:07] remind you of the scripture in
[53:13] Exodus do you remember in Exodus in
[53:17] Deuteronomy When God says I'm taking you
[53:20] to the land but I will drive out the
[53:22] inhabitants I will fight and you'll
[53:25] possess the land and your foot steps or
[53:27] possession amen it's we're going to see
[53:30] a manifestation of that now but but also
[53:33] when in The Exodus Journey when am uh
[53:35] amalec came out to fight them remember
[53:38] we looked at the scripture where when
[53:39] Moses had his hands up they prevailed
[53:41] but when Moses hands dropped it was all
[53:42] dependent on Moses well now we've
[53:45] entered into the land here in Joshua 10
[53:47] and they're beginning to drive back
[53:48] enemies and Moses isn't there so now
[53:51] their Victory is not dependent on Moses
[53:53] holding up the rod anymore
[53:56] and so now the promises of God are
[53:58] taking effect in their lives
[54:00] personally and I want to look at uh
[54:03] verse 7 let's go to chapter 10 ver
[54:06] 7 says so Joshua ascended from gilgal he
[54:09] and all the people of war with him and
[54:11] all the Mighty Men of Valor and the Lord
[54:14] said unto Joshua fear them not for I
[54:16] have delivered them un thy hand there
[54:18] shall not a man of them stand before
[54:20] thee Joshua therefore came unto them
[54:22] suddenly and went up from gilgal all
[54:25] night and the Lord discomforted them
[54:27] before Israel and slew them with a great
[54:29] Slaughter at gibian and chased them
[54:31] along the way that that goeth up to
[54:35] bethon and smokee them to ezeka and then
[54:38] to
[54:39] mad and it came to pass as they fled
[54:42] from before Israel and we're going down
[54:44] to Beth Haron that the Lord cast down
[54:47] great stones from Heaven upon them unto
[54:50] azaka and they died they were and there
[54:52] were more which died with the hailstones
[54:55] than they whom the children of Israel
[54:57] slew with the sword you know what's
[54:59] beautiful about this is God's fighting
[55:01] right alongside them amen they're
[55:03] cutting some down and he's stoning some
[55:05] from Heaven amen and God's doing more
[55:08] than they are this is what he promised
[55:11] he God didn't say I'll go do it all for
[55:13] you neither did he said you'll do it all
[55:15] by yourself but he says you possess it
[55:17] and I'll drive them out you make
[55:19] footsteps and I'll give it to you amen
[55:21] and God is working with his people amen
[55:24] and they're taking the land they're
[55:25] driving back back the inhabitants and
[55:27] they're slaying him with the sword and
[55:29] he's throwing down stones from Heaven at
[55:31] him praise be to God I believe that God
[55:33] still can work that way with us friends
[55:35] but we got to have confidence and not
[55:37] sit back on our heels and do nothing
[55:39] about it and say God you do God you do
[55:42] God you do no God says you do you do you
[55:45] do and I believe when we get into action
[55:47] and have faith in God that God will
[55:48] fight with us and for us and before us
[55:51] and behind us and all around us but
[55:53] we've got to be fighting friends we've
[55:55] got be taking the word and applying the
[55:58] word we've got to be resisting
[55:59] everything that comes against the word
[56:01] whether it's inside of us or outside of
[56:04] us we've got to resist whatever is
[56:06] hindering the word of
[56:08] God Amen so now God's throwing down
[56:12] Stones I love it I love that scripture I
[56:15] I just read that today over and over and
[56:17] got super excited when I read that how'
[56:20] you like to know you're in the midst of
[56:21] a battle and you're doing all you can
[56:22] and you're Swinging The Sword of the
[56:24] word as hard as you can amen and you you
[56:26] feel the battle hot and heavy and you're
[56:28] doing you're giving it you're all and
[56:29] all a sudden you're th th th th th th th
[56:32] and you say oh God's over there wiping
[56:34] them out praise be to God you think it
[56:37] doesn't give you courage and energy to
[56:38] keep going when you've pressed and
[56:40] pressed but you see God do that little
[56:42] something special and he moved that
[56:44] obstacle you couldn't move amen you were
[56:46] there moving everything else you could
[56:48] move but God did the thing you couldn't
[56:50] do praise be to
[56:53] God let's go back here to pick it up in
[56:56] verse
[56:58] 12 verse 12 then spake Joshua to the
[57:02] Lord in the day when the Lord delivered
[57:04] up the amorites before the children of
[57:06] Israel and he said in the sight of
[57:08] Israel
[57:09] son stand thou still upon gibian and
[57:13] thou moon in the valley of aelon and the
[57:16] sun Stood Still and the moon stayed
[57:18] until the people had Avenged themselves
[57:20] upon their enemies is not this written
[57:23] in the book of jasher so the son stood
[57:25] still in the mid of heaven and hastened
[57:27] not to go down about a whole day and
[57:31] there was no day like that before it or
[57:33] after it that the Lord hearkened into
[57:35] the voice of a man for the Lord fought
[57:38] for
[57:40] Israel this become astounding to me
[57:43] because when they fought the uh uh
[57:46] amalec the amalekites amen Moses was the
[57:49] one holding his hand and where however
[57:51] Moses hands went the the battle went
[57:52] they were out there doing all they could
[57:54] but it was dependent completely upon
[57:56] Moses but now amen we find out that now
[57:59] God is fighting with his people all the
[58:02] people they're all fighting they're all
[58:03] Swinging The Sword and God's fighting
[58:05] with them but they get to a place amen
[58:08] where God has commissioned them to
[58:09] possess the land and drive out the
[58:11] inhabitants and slay them all and
[58:12] they're doing the work of God Amen but
[58:15] they're running out of time and Joshua
[58:17] isn't looking around for somebody else
[58:19] to come and help him Joshua says son you
[58:22] got to stand still Moon I need more time
[58:24] to do what God has called me to do and
[58:27] listen he doesn't speak and say God you
[58:29] just wipe out the rest of them no he
[58:31] knew that was his job to do that was
[58:33] what God told him to do amen what he
[58:36] needed was more time to do what God
[58:38] called him to do he wasn't asking God to
[58:41] do for him what God gave him to
[58:47] do what he was saying was in order for
[58:50] me to do what God told me to do and stay
[58:52] in the word and program of God I'm going
[58:54] to do what he told me to do but I need
[58:57] the sun to stand still I got to have
[58:59] some more time and the sun stood till
[59:01] still till they finished avenging
[59:03] themselves of their enemy that means
[59:05] they kept slaying and kept slaying and
[59:07] kept slaying and kept slaying they
[59:09] didn't sit back and say oh well that
[59:11] works than God you do
[59:15] no listen there's things in this life
[59:18] that God's asked us to
[59:21] do and so many times we want God to do
[59:24] it
[59:28] amen but there's times in doing what
[59:31] God's called us to do and giving it all
[59:33] we got there's an obstacle that's
[59:35] preventing
[59:38] us oh I believe if we're in God's
[59:41] Commission in God's word in our adopted
[59:45] position doing what God called us to do
[59:47] and there's an obstacle we can't do
[59:49] anything about I I think that's when we
[59:51] can begin to speak to the
[59:53] obstacle not presumptuously not not
[59:56] making big demands but saying this has
[59:58] got to go this is hindering my work this
[1:00:00] is stopping me from fulfilling my
[1:00:02] purpose this has got to get out God it's
[1:00:04] got to go I'm pushing back devil you got
[1:00:07] to get out of the way circumstance
[1:00:09] you've got to change because I'm under a
[1:00:11] commission I'm under a calling I'm in my
[1:00:13] position I'm doing what God called me to
[1:00:16] do
[1:00:18] amen not saying God this is too hard you
[1:00:20] finished the job no you gave me to do it
[1:00:25] I want to be faithful to do
[1:00:27] it but sometimes this obstacle got to
[1:00:31] go brother brother bam makes a statement
[1:00:34] about that in the message Paradox he's
[1:00:36] referring to what Joshua did he says
[1:00:39] it's a paradox but God Did It Anyways
[1:00:43] what by a man not a God not some great
[1:00:47] angel coming down from heaven a man with
[1:00:49] faith in the mission that he was given
[1:00:51] to take that land the word of God was
[1:00:54] behind it I give you this land and
[1:00:56] everywhere The Souls of your foot Shall
[1:00:57] Set upon that I give you it's yours
[1:00:59] footsteps means meant possession and the
[1:01:02] Sun the achievement he was trying to do
[1:01:05] see his enemy was routed he knew if the
[1:01:07] son ever set them Kings would get
[1:01:09] together and they'd come back upon him
[1:01:11] with double Force so the sun was going
[1:01:13] down and Joshua a man commanded to do
[1:01:17] this said Son stand still further down
[1:01:20] in the same quote he says Jesus said in
[1:01:22] St Mark 11:22 if you say to this
[1:01:24] mountain be moved and don't down in your
[1:01:26] heart but believe that what you said
[1:01:28] will come to pass you can have what you
[1:01:30] said but that that takes motive and
[1:01:34] objective of course you got to have a
[1:01:36] reason for it you can't have faith
[1:01:39] unless you got some reason those things
[1:01:42] move by faith amen Joshua had Faith
[1:01:44] because he knew what he was supposed to
[1:01:45] be doing and he knew he had to do it and
[1:01:47] he knew now was the time and this was
[1:01:49] the right season and he knew and his
[1:01:51] faith and what he was called to do
[1:01:53] caused him to say son stand still and if
[1:01:55] we have to speak to obstacles and speak
[1:01:57] to things in our life that are hindering
[1:01:59] us we have to do it by faith not by some
[1:02:01] hope but not some by enchantment but by
[1:02:04] faith faith in what when we have the
[1:02:06] right motive and the right objective and
[1:02:08] we get inspiration and say God I don't
[1:02:10] see any other way this thing's got to
[1:02:12] move out of my way this has got to come
[1:02:14] out of my life this thing's got to be
[1:02:16] separated from me so that I can keep
[1:02:17] doing what you called me to
[1:02:20] do
[1:02:23] amen amen
[1:02:26] praise be to
[1:02:28] God
[1:02:30] so now the children of
[1:02:33] Israel are driving out the
[1:02:37] inhabitants
[1:02:39] amen
[1:02:41] there's
[1:02:42] inhabitants on our land sometimes that's
[1:02:45] keeping us for the full promise of the
[1:02:47] word there's false understandings
[1:02:50] there's false teachings there's wrong
[1:02:52] ideas there's our own traditional
[1:02:54] thinking
[1:02:56] sometimes it's stuff within
[1:02:59] us that are plugging up the works it's
[1:03:03] our own way of viewing things some maybe
[1:03:05] habits that we formed maybe we've got uh
[1:03:08] uh some hindrances or some fears or some
[1:03:11] complexes or something that that is
[1:03:13] tripping us up and hindering us from
[1:03:15] doing what God's got to do but oh I say
[1:03:17] friends resist the devil and he shall
[1:03:19] flee keep pressing against it it's got
[1:03:22] to go amen because we've got to take the
[1:03:25] land it whole listen Israel was to take
[1:03:28] everything Moses said and make it live
[1:03:30] in that land to have a a tabernacle to
[1:03:33] bring their tithe to have the feast to
[1:03:35] Feast before the Lord to plant in the
[1:03:37] right season to bring the Vintage and

[1:03:44] up amen if it's sold then for it to go
[1:03:46] back amen every seven years the the
[1:03:49] Israelites are sold every seven years
[1:03:50] the land every fth year all of that word
[1:03:52] had to be made manifest on that land and
[1:03:55] that was their job to do it but I'm
[1:03:56] telling you we live in a day that the
[1:03:58] whole word has to be made manifest in us
[1:04:01] all of it not part of it not 50% not 75
[1:04:05] but there's a people on the land amen
[1:04:07] there's a people in the land at the end
[1:04:09] time that has got to make this book live
[1:04:12] what is the bride she's the New
[1:04:13] Testament that's all what does she have
[1:04:15] to manifest the New Testament amen each
[1:04:18] one of us have to take our portion our
[1:04:21] part amen it wasn't for one person
[1:04:23] anymore when they came to adoption now
[1:04:25] when they came to the land it wasn't one
[1:04:27] person's job to do it all it was
[1:04:29] everybody to do their
[1:04:31] portion and each of us have a portion of
[1:04:34] this word to live we have a certain uh
[1:04:37] status in life We're Young middle-aged
[1:04:39] old we're male we're female we're kids
[1:04:41] we're parents we're employers we're
[1:04:43] whatever we are but whatever we are
[1:04:45] we've got to make this word live out of
[1:04:47] this land wherever God's put us that's
[1:04:50] our individual responsibility and
[1:04:52] collectively the bride has got to make
[1:04:54] this message live
[1:04:56] it's got to be on display it's got to be
[1:04:58] a Living Word it's got to be Christ
[1:05:01] manifest to the world Amen and not one
[1:05:03] person's going to do it anymore God's
[1:05:05] taken the prophet who displayed what it
[1:05:07] was but now he's marched us across
[1:05:09] Jordan into this word to possess it and
[1:05:13] we've got to possess it amen not just
[1:05:15] say I'm I'm just a I'm on a tour I'm
[1:05:18] touring
[1:05:21] around no but this is my part to live
[1:05:24] I'm going to live it
[1:05:30] oh let's look here at Joshua
[1:05:32] 1 I mean judges one sorry not Joshua
[1:05:35] Judges let's skip to the next
[1:05:48] book Judges chapter
[1:05:53] 1 verse 18
[1:05:59] says also Judah took Gaza with the coast
[1:06:03] thereof and ascalon and the coast
[1:06:05] thereof and erron with the coast thereof
[1:06:08] and the Lord was with Judah and he drove
[1:06:10] out the inhabitants of the mountain but
[1:06:12] he could not drive out the inhabitants
[1:06:14] of the valley because they had Chariots
[1:06:16] of
[1:06:18] iron it was
[1:06:21] tough they had Chariots of iron and they
[1:06:23] could not drive them out let's go down
[1:06:25] to verse
[1:06:27] 27 neither did Manasseh drive out the
[1:06:30] inhabitants of bethen and her towns nor
[1:06:33] tanok in her towns nor the inhabitants
[1:06:35] of dor in her towns nor the inhabitants
[1:06:37] of eam in her towns nor the inhabitants
[1:06:39] of megiddo in her towns but the
[1:06:41] Canaanites would dwell in the land and
[1:06:43] it came to pass when Israel was strong
[1:06:45] that they put the Canaanites to Tribute
[1:06:47] and did not utterly drive them
[1:06:51] out man this is a sad portion of the
[1:06:55] story We Know It starts the decline of
[1:06:59] Israel but Judah starts with great
[1:07:04] successes and great victories and taking
[1:07:06] great swaths of land and pushing back
[1:07:08] enormous
[1:07:09] enemies but they got this one little
[1:07:12] area that they can't take because the
[1:07:14] Canaanites have iron
[1:07:17] chariots if you read through it all this
[1:07:19] tribe couldn't fully possess this and
[1:07:21] this one could take the hills but not
[1:07:22] the valleys this one could take the
[1:07:23] valleys but not the hills then and
[1:07:25] everywhere there was little encampments
[1:07:27] of Canaanites left over because they
[1:07:29] couldn't fully drive them out there was
[1:07:32] some difficult things that just wouldn't
[1:07:37] budge that's
[1:07:39] right I don't know if you've lived long
[1:07:41] enough to have some difficult things
[1:07:43] that just don't
[1:07:46] budge but the problem is they put them
[1:07:49] under
[1:07:50] tribute the problem with tribute is they
[1:07:53] had a PCT with them and an agreement and
[1:07:54] they put them on under servitude okay
[1:07:56] we're your boss you're our
[1:07:59] servants but God told them not to do
[1:08:02] that Moses said don't make League don't
[1:08:05] make a covenant with any of the
[1:08:07] inhabitants and that's what a tribute is
[1:08:10] they put them under League they they
[1:08:11] made a covenant with them and God had
[1:08:13] told them don't you dare do it it
[1:08:15] doesn't matter how many iron chariots
[1:08:17] how tough it is and how entrenched they
[1:08:19] are you remember the stronghold of the
[1:08:21] jebusites amen that would became the
[1:08:23] city of David amen they took Jerusalem
[1:08:25] but they couldn't take the city of Zion
[1:08:26] they couldn't take uh uh uh the the city
[1:08:29] of the jebusites the stronghold of the
[1:08:31] jebusites they couldn't take it for
[1:08:33] generations and generations until David
[1:08:35] come along but under the ministry of
[1:08:37] David they finally broke through and
[1:08:39] took the stronghold of the jebusites and
[1:08:41] that became the city of David and listen
[1:08:43] it doesn't matter how long it takes keep
[1:08:45] pressing until until what until the
[1:08:48] stronghold of the jebusites becomes what
[1:08:51] the stronghold of the jebusites become
[1:08:53] an impenetrable Fortress that they can
[1:08:55] never never rid themselves of it was
[1:08:56] always right in the middle of Israel and
[1:08:58] they could never get rid of it but it
[1:09:00] was transformed one day why because of
[1:09:03] persistent effort because of a king on
[1:09:05] the throne amen because of Mighty
[1:09:07] Warriors who had confidence in David
[1:09:09] amen they finally were able to turn the
[1:09:11] jebusite stronghold into the city of
[1:09:14] David the place of the Throne of the
[1:09:16] king amen there's sometimes strongholds
[1:09:19] in our life because of things that we
[1:09:21] allowed or things that happened to us or
[1:09:22] things that we've got but I want to keep
[1:09:24] pressing until that stronghold of an
[1:09:26] enemy becomes a place for the throne of
[1:09:29] my
[1:09:30] king
[1:09:32] amen don't want to quit and certainly
[1:09:34] don't want to put it under
[1:09:36] tribute CU when I put it under tribute I
[1:09:39] make a peace
[1:09:40] agreement and the peace agreement is as
[1:09:43] long as you stay small and subdued and
[1:09:46] don't cause me any problems I'll leave
[1:09:48] you alone you leave me
[1:09:50] alone but the problem is those little
[1:09:53] Canaanite Pockets never remain little
[1:09:55] they kep reproducing and reproducing and
[1:09:57] they always came back to fight him and
[1:09:59] that's where all their Wars begin to
[1:10:00] come
[1:10:03] from praise God brother Brenham says in
[1:10:07] the in the marriage of the
[1:10:10] Lamb he said so many says if the Lord
[1:10:12] will take this evil spirit from me from
[1:10:14] drinking or from gambling or from lying
[1:10:16] or stealing I'll serve him but that's up
[1:10:20] to you see you got to do something too
[1:10:24] they that overcome shall inherit all
[1:10:26] things they that overcome you have power
[1:10:29] to do it but you must be willing to lay
[1:10:32] it down see she has made herself ready I
[1:10:34] like that word you see God could not
[1:10:37] push us through a little pipe pull us
[1:10:38] out the other end and and then say
[1:10:40] blessed is he that overcometh you have
[1:10:42] nothing to overcome he just pushed you
[1:10:45] through but you've got to make decisions
[1:10:47] for yourself have to make decisions for
[1:10:49] myself in doing that we show our faith
[1:10:51] in respects to
[1:10:53] God this I mean look at with this list
[1:10:56] take away from me drinking gambling
[1:10:57] lying you think oh God if you could just
[1:10:59] take away these bad habits if you could
[1:11:01] take away my habit of this or my habit
[1:11:03] or that or or my temper or my jealousy
[1:11:06] or my bitter if you could just take it
[1:11:08] away from me everything would be fine
[1:11:10] and and this is what brother B said
[1:11:12] that's up to you there's things that we
[1:11:14] have to fight amen I don't care if they
[1:11:17] got iron chariots you may have got a
[1:11:19] temper from your great great grandma to
[1:11:20] the grandma to Mom to you it doesn't
[1:11:23] matter it's not allowed to day it does
[1:11:25] not belong in the land if it's contrary
[1:11:28] to the stature of a perfect man if it's
[1:11:30] contrary to the nature of Jesus Christ
[1:11:32] it has no right to stay in your
[1:11:35] land amen you may not get rid of at the
[1:11:38] first attempt or the 10th attempt or the
[1:11:40] 30th attempt but don't put it under
[1:11:42] tribute don't say as long as you stay on
[1:11:44] the side and only flare up once in a
[1:11:46] while and only my husband ever sees it
[1:11:48] don't you dare do that you say that
[1:11:50] thing's got to get out of my life I
[1:11:52] don't know how and I don't know when but
[1:11:54] it's got to go and and I will not accept
[1:11:56] it here because the only thing this land
[1:11:58] is supposed to do is Manifest the word
[1:12:01] not something that great grandma
[1:12:02] struggled with our grandpa struggled
[1:12:04] with this is the be this is to become
[1:12:06] the stature of a perfect man the very
[1:12:08] nature the divine nature of God living
[1:12:10] through
[1:12:13] flesh amen I don't care if it's five
[1:12:16] minutes before I die that I get
[1:12:17] Deliverance I'm going to keep pushing
[1:12:19] till I get
[1:12:20] Deliverance I don't want to accept it
[1:12:23] and sometimes in our lives we ow things
[1:12:25] as tribute we we put it under tribute as
[1:12:28] long as you don't wreck my life as as
[1:12:30] long as you don't take over as long as
[1:12:31] I'm Not In conflict all the time every
[1:12:33] once in a
[1:12:38] while but Moses told him don't do
[1:12:41] that don't do
[1:12:45] that brother brandham in the message
[1:12:47] presuming he has a lady coming to the
[1:12:48] prayer line and this really blessed
[1:12:53] me the it says on the on the transcript
[1:12:57] the sister speaks to brother Bram she's
[1:12:58] talking to brother brandham coming
[1:13:00] through the prayer
[1:13:01] line and brother BR says God bless you
[1:13:04] Sister would you just a
[1:13:07] moment the lady sincerely confessed she
[1:13:10] said she has a spirit on her of high
[1:13:13] temper and we realize that that's not
[1:13:16] nice but sister not only you but there's
[1:13:19] plenty of us you see but maybe come
[1:13:22] might uh some might not be as honest to
[1:13:25] to confess it but he that will confess
[1:13:27] his sins he that hide his sins will not
[1:13:30] Prosper but he that will confess his
[1:13:32] sins Shall Have Mercy you know that so I
[1:13:34] pray Heavenly Father by laying hands on
[1:13:36] on sister that this temper will leave
[1:13:38] her may it never bother her again in the
[1:13:41] name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:43] amen you know what that was a woman who
[1:13:46] wasn't willing to put that temper under
[1:13:47] tribute
[1:13:49] anymore that was a woman who had lived
[1:13:51] with it who knows how long and who knows
[1:13:53] how long she struggled with it and long
[1:13:55] resisted or what had happened in her
[1:13:57] life but she come to a prayer line to
[1:14:00] confess to another man I've got a
[1:14:02] problem with the temper Amen to do what
[1:14:06] to expose The Hiding Place of the devil
[1:14:08] to expose why because she didn't want it
[1:14:11] there
[1:14:15] anymore amen sometimes resisting doesn't
[1:14:18] mean just gritting your teeth and
[1:14:20] clenching your fist as hard as you can
[1:14:22] sometimes what you got to do is expose
[1:14:23] the very thing you're trying to get rid
[1:14:24] of you got to hate it enough to not want
[1:14:27] it in your life you got to hate it so
[1:14:29] much you're willing to maybe ask
[1:14:30] somebody to pray with you about it
[1:14:31] confess it to them and say I've got this
[1:14:33] thing I got to get rid of and it's and
[1:14:35] it's hiding in my life it's rooted in
[1:14:37] it's between the cracks and the crevices
[1:14:39] of the high mountain and they got iron
[1:14:41] chariots and I've inherited it and I'm
[1:14:42] having a hard time with it amen and you
[1:14:44] might just need somebody to come and
[1:14:46] pray with you you might just need to
[1:14:48] confess it you might need to expose it
[1:14:49] and you might need to say I'm refusing
[1:14:52] to let it remain unchecked I'm pushing
[1:14:55] against it with all my
[1:14:58] might oh praise God if we can just do
[1:15:00] God God told the Israelites I will fight
[1:15:04] for you and I will drive them out but he
[1:15:06] didn't just say you stand on the bank I
[1:15:08] drive them out then you come in no he
[1:15:10] drove them out as they
[1:15:13] fought and as they fought some didn't go
[1:15:16] so easy but that never changed the fact
[1:15:19] that God said he would drive them out
[1:15:21] what he wanted them to do was keep
[1:15:22] fighting amen don't stop don't put under
[1:15:25] tribute it'll go amen remember brother
[1:15:28] Bam's uh nervous stomach tense stomach
[1:15:30] that he had and a stomach condition all
[1:15:32] of his life and it cycled through his
[1:15:34] life seven times and when he was coming
[1:15:35] to the eighth time amen was at the end
[1:15:37] of his ministry in 1965 brother brandham
[1:15:40] pushed against that and pushed against
[1:15:42] it and he prayed he went to doctors he
[1:15:45] went to Mayo Clinic he got a stomach
[1:15:46] scope he was not willing to live with it
[1:15:49] he knew his God was a Healer and he was
[1:15:51] believing God for healing whether it
[1:15:53] came from medicine where it came from
[1:15:54] Sur surgery whether it came from a
[1:15:55] doctor whether it was God's hand by
[1:15:57] himself he didn't care he was wanting
[1:15:59] healing and he so believed and so pushed
[1:16:02] and so resisted that condition till God
[1:16:05] delivered him and he preached a message
[1:16:07] called on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:16:09] when God promised him his healing and
[1:16:11] delivered him from that condition that
[1:16:13] plagued him all his
[1:16:14] life and then he took him off the scene
[1:16:16] 30 days
[1:16:20] later that was a tremendous Victory
[1:16:22] friends
[1:16:26] no telling no there there's no telling
[1:16:29] why God let it remain there was
[1:16:32] something God was doing he was doing
[1:16:34] something maybe for us maybe for the
[1:16:37] prophet maybe for both maybe for the
[1:16:39] family he was training him maybe he was
[1:16:42] uh uh maybe he had to keep him in check
[1:16:44] like he had to keep the Apostle Paul in
[1:16:45] check I don't know why that the prophet
[1:16:48] was plagued like that God had a purpose
[1:16:50] in it
[1:16:51] all there's things in our life that
[1:16:53] maybe they don't go so easy Maybe some
[1:16:55] things we just delivered of like that no
[1:16:56] problem it just goes other things we
[1:16:58] struggle and struggle and struggle with
[1:17:00] amen I don't know why God let them Drive
[1:17:03] some enemies back and hold the sun in
[1:17:05] place till they killed all of them in
[1:17:07] that area but then there was some
[1:17:08] Canaanites with iron chariots they
[1:17:10] couldn't get out so easy I don't know
[1:17:11] why God lets these things happen in our
[1:17:13] lives where we have tremendous Victory
[1:17:15] one day and the next day we got this
[1:17:17] little Annoying nagging Thorn that we
[1:17:19] can't seem to get rid of I don't know
[1:17:21] why but God will it's going to work
[1:17:23] God's purpose somehow it's working for
[1:17:25] the good some way God's got a purpose in
[1:17:27] it all and I thank him for it but I'm
[1:17:29] not going to stop pressing against
[1:17:32] it unless he tells me to like he told
[1:17:35] the Apostle Paul but if he doesn't tell
[1:17:37] me I want to be like the prophet of God
[1:17:39] and I want to be praying for my healing
[1:17:41] and deliverance all
[1:17:44] along like I said if it comes 5 minutes
[1:17:46] before my death praise God I had victory
[1:17:48] over that thing in my
[1:17:51] life praise be to
[1:17:53] God I don't don't want to put it under
[1:17:58] tribute Judges chapter
[1:18:01] 2 verse
[1:18:06] one Judges chapter 2 verse one and an
[1:18:10] angel of the Lord came up from gilgal to
[1:18:12] bacham and said I made you to go up out
[1:18:15] of Egypt and I have brought you into the
[1:18:16] land which I swear unto your fathers and
[1:18:19] I said I will never break my Covenant
[1:18:20] with you and you shall make no league
[1:18:23] with the inhabitants of this land you
[1:18:25] shall throw down their altars but you
[1:18:27] have not obeyed my voice why have you
[1:18:30] done this wherefore I also said I will
[1:18:33] not drive them out from before you but
[1:18:35] they shall be as thorns in your sides
[1:18:37] and their God shall be a snare unto
[1:18:40] you he said you put them under tribute
[1:18:42] and you left them there why did you do
[1:18:44] that and if you go back to the uh Exodus
[1:18:46] Exodus 34:11 Moses told them ahead of
[1:18:49] time don't do
[1:18:51] that and they did it and here comes an
[1:18:54] angel of the Lord down to rebuke them
[1:18:56] and say why did you do that now I won't
[1:18:59] drive them out before
[1:19:03] you let's put this in perspective here
[1:19:06] as we wind
[1:19:08] down they had enemies they could not
[1:19:13] overcome they could not they tried but
[1:19:16] they could not they were strong they
[1:19:18] were embedded for whatever reason they
[1:19:20] could
[1:19:21] not so they put them under tribute
[1:19:24] because that was the easy e thing for
[1:19:25] them to do so they didn't have to keep
[1:19:26] fighting so they could go on enjoying
[1:19:28] the promised land that flowed with milk
[1:19:29] and honey they could get on with
[1:19:31] building their Estates and they could
[1:19:32] get on with doing what they wanted to
[1:19:35] do and so they let them go and now God
[1:19:38] sends an angel down to rebuke them for
[1:19:40] doing what he told them not to do and
[1:19:42] says now I'll not drive them
[1:19:47] out see it's interesting because they
[1:19:51] couldn't drive them out so it looked
[1:19:52] like God wasn't driving them out
[1:19:57] but God's promise was still true he
[1:19:59] would drive them
[1:20:01] out amen they just needed to learn some
[1:20:04] patience and endurance and
[1:20:07] perseverance but now when they put it
[1:20:10] under tribute God said I'll not drive it
[1:20:12] out now you'll deal with this
[1:20:15] forever it it'll be a thorn in your
[1:20:19] flesh listen it looks like sometimes
[1:20:22] God's not driving things out of our Liv
[1:20:25] lives but he
[1:20:27] promised his word would work he's given
[1:20:31] us promise and all the promises are true
[1:20:33] to us it doesn't matter if it looks like
[1:20:36] it's not moving amen God will someday
[1:20:38] move it if you stay with the word and
[1:20:40] stay persistent and believe God and stay
[1:20:43] focused on his word and don't put that
[1:20:46] thing under tribute but you just keep
[1:20:47] saying in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:20:49] you've got to
[1:20:52] go amen next day you got to to go the
[1:20:55] next day you got to go it doesn't matter
[1:20:56] how long you push back against it but
[1:20:58] don't you dare accept it as a normal
[1:21:00] part of life unless God tells you too
[1:21:03] yes he did that to Paul he could do that
[1:21:05] to you but if he hasn't done that to you
[1:21:07] stick with the word until the word comes
[1:21:09] to
[1:21:12] manifestation praise
[1:21:16] God let's turn to Joshua 17 if you could
[1:21:19] turn back with
[1:21:21] me Joshua 17
[1:21:25] I want to read something to
[1:21:27] you that Joshua told
[1:21:36] Joseph Joshua 17:16 now remember when we
[1:21:39] were over judges it said that Judah they
[1:21:42] couldn't overcome the Canaanites because
[1:21:43] they had iron chariots but let's look
[1:21:46] here in in Joshua 17 verse
[1:21:49] 16 and the children of Joseph said the
[1:21:52] hill is not enough for us and all the
[1:21:54] Canaanites that dwell in the land of the
[1:21:56] valley have Chariots of iron both they
[1:21:58] who are of bethen and her towns and they
[1:22:01] who are of the valley of jezriel and
[1:22:03] Joshua spoke unto the house of Joseph
[1:22:06] even to Ephraim and Manasseh saying thou
[1:22:08] art a great people and has great power
[1:22:11] Thou shalt not have one lot only but the
[1:22:14] mountain shall be thine for it is a wood
[1:22:16] and thou shalt cut it down and the the
[1:22:18] out growing of it shall be thine for
[1:22:20] Thou shalt also drive out the Canaanites
[1:22:23] though they have iron chariots and
[1:22:25] though they be
[1:22:27] strong he already told Joseph man the
[1:22:32] the the half tribe of Manassa and
[1:22:33] Ephraim he already told the tribe of
[1:22:34] Joseph he already said yes that they're
[1:22:37] there with iron chariots but you're a
[1:22:39] mighty and strong people don't forget
[1:22:41] who you are amen you will drive them out
[1:22:44] amen and if God will do it for one he'll
[1:22:46] do it for another if he can do it for
[1:22:48] Joseph he could have done it for Judah
[1:22:50] if Judah would only believe what the
[1:22:52] Holy Ghost had done and the for somebody
[1:22:55] else and what he had promised Amen
[1:22:56] brother bam said if God Did It for one
[1:22:59] if I can approach him the same way he's
[1:23:00] obligated to do it for me and if if
[1:23:03] Joseph can drive out the iron chariots
[1:23:05] Judah could drive out the iron chariots
[1:23:07] they could all drive out the iron
[1:23:09] chariots they just have to believe that
[1:23:12] they
[1:23:13] can amen the problem is sometimes we
[1:23:15] don't believe we can we have to believe
[1:23:17] we can because God said he would help us
[1:23:19] amen God said he would fight for us and
[1:23:22] with us and if we'll take footsteps
[1:23:23] they'll become possessions amen we got
[1:23:25] to keep pressing into that thing and you
[1:23:27] may not get very far the next time but
[1:23:29] if you can get a centimeter more land
[1:23:32] take a centimeter more land amen and
[1:23:34] give this thing less room to work in our
[1:23:36] lives amen if we got to press just a
[1:23:38] little bit more next time and take
[1:23:39] another centimeter it may be hard and it
[1:23:42] may be difficult and you may have to lay
[1:23:44] yourself bear to everybody you know you
[1:23:46] may have to go around apologizing every
[1:23:48] time you do the same thing you've done
[1:23:49] over and over again amen just to expose
[1:23:52] that thing to kill that Spirit that's in
[1:23:54] in there
[1:23:55] yes and it may be hard and you may do it
[1:23:59] you may do it till you're embarrassed
[1:24:00] you may do it till you're tired of it
[1:24:01] but if you hate that thing and push
[1:24:03] against it it'll
[1:24:06] go
[1:24:09] amen there's a responsibility that comes
[1:24:12] with
[1:24:13] adoption God hasen't given us his word
[1:24:16] so we can say oh we have the blessings
[1:24:17] of the Lord he's given us his word so
[1:24:21] that we can make the word live in in us
[1:24:25] so we can surrender to it submit to it
[1:24:28] apply it in our lives manifest it
[1:24:31] through our lives there is something for
[1:24:33] us to do and it's for us to possess this
[1:24:38] land brother Brenham says in the stature
[1:24:40] of a perfect man he says you get it
[1:24:43] these people who died in there are
[1:24:45] depending and waiting on us so the
[1:24:48] church has got to come to perfection in
[1:24:50] order to bring the
[1:24:52] resurrection he said says in 1965 in the
[1:24:55] message and knoweth it not he said what
[1:24:58] are we coming here for what are we doing
[1:25:00] are we coming here playing a game are we
[1:25:02] coming here meeting as a lodge it's ch
[1:25:05] Christ can't come until that church is
[1:25:08] perfectly right he's waiting on us
[1:25:13] yes do you believe that I said God I'm
[1:25:17] sorry that's all I can say is God I'm
[1:25:19] sorry I have been guilty of putting
[1:25:21] things in my life under tribute I don't
[1:25:23] want to put them under tribute I mean
[1:25:26] there's for some of us we've served the
[1:25:27] Lord long enough there's things we've
[1:25:29] got rid of in our life and got out of
[1:25:30] our life that's creeped back in Shame
[1:25:33] Shame Shame on us we got victory over it
[1:25:36] once why did we let it creep back in
[1:25:38] amen Fashions of the world and
[1:25:39] entertainment things and things that
[1:25:41] when we first come to the message we
[1:25:43] kicked it all out and we got victory
[1:25:44] over it we had overcoming power to
[1:25:46] overcome it and because we got so wise
[1:25:48] in the message we become so so good as
[1:25:51] Believers we started thinking we could
[1:25:53] handle some of these things and now
[1:25:54] we're allowing the very things we drove
[1:25:56] out to creep back in shame on us amen
[1:25:59] let's have Victory and drive it
[1:26:02] out and let this word live in me please
[1:26:07] God I need your help I can't do it by
[1:26:09] myself but you
[1:26:10] promised this is the age this is the
[1:26:13] hour you will have a church without spot
[1:26:15] or wrinkle or any blemish or any such
[1:26:17] thing you promised it you'll have it
[1:26:19] you'll present it to
[1:26:21] yourself I believe it
[1:26:25] but I'm not just going to sit on the
[1:26:27] sidelines and say God you've got to do
[1:26:30] now here's my list of things you got to
[1:26:32] fixing
[1:26:33] me no we've got to be striving against
[1:26:36] it friends pushing back and resisting
[1:26:39] the devil and all of his tactics in
[1:26:41] every area he tries to get a stronghold
[1:26:44] we got to push and trust God if I can't
[1:26:49] get him with the sword he'll get him
[1:26:51] with the
[1:26:52] stone but he'll work with me he won't
[1:26:54] leave me all by
[1:26:56] myself it may have felt like for them
[1:26:59] when they couldn't drive out the
[1:27:00] inhabitants they were all alone where
[1:27:02] was God where was The Great sweeping
[1:27:04] Victory but God had never changed his
[1:27:06] mind about them or about his promise God
[1:27:09] has never changed his mind about us or
[1:27:11] the promise or what he wants to
[1:27:13] accomplish in this end time it's the
[1:27:15] same he's always wanted to accomplish he
[1:27:18] wants to manifest himself in a many
[1:27:21] membered
[1:27:22] body and each of us have the
[1:27:25] responsibility to make the word live in
[1:27:28] our portion our land our positional
[1:27:32] placing in the body of Christ and that's
[1:27:35] our
[1:27:37] responsibility it's our responsibility
[1:27:40] nobody's going to pray for you it's your
[1:27:41] job to
[1:27:43] pray nobody's going to read for you read
[1:27:46] the Bible and read the message and
[1:27:47] listen to nobody's going to do that for
[1:27:48] you that's your responsibility nobody's
[1:27:50] going to feed on the word for you it's
[1:27:52] your responsibility to feed on the word
[1:27:54] for
[1:27:54] yourself nobody can climb inside of you
[1:27:57] and be honest for
[1:27:58] you and say I'm struggling with this and
[1:28:02] I need to overcome this and and really I
[1:28:04] did that for these reasons I've got
[1:28:06] ulterior motives for I'm looking
[1:28:08] religious but I have another reason for
[1:28:09] doing it it's meeting some need inside
[1:28:11] of me nobody else can do that for you
[1:28:13] friends you've got to do that
[1:28:15] yourself you got to be real and genuine
[1:28:18] in the place and position God's put you
[1:28:20] and say I've been playing the part of a
[1:28:21] hypocrite I've been playing like I'm
[1:28:23] this to everybody else but I'm actually
[1:28:24] on the side this you've got to deal with
[1:28:27] that nobody else can do it for you
[1:28:29] that's for you to
[1:28:33] do there are some things that he's left
[1:28:35] for us to do and he'll help us I believe
[1:28:39] he'll help us I believe he'll drive out
[1:28:41] the
[1:28:43] enemies but I think footsteps are still
[1:28:47] possession got to take the promise of
[1:28:49] the word and take the sword of the word
[1:28:50] and drive it to the heart of the enemy
[1:28:52] and keep pushing it
[1:28:55] until something Moves In Our Lives I
[1:28:57] don't want to get satisfied with the
[1:28:59] same way I've always been I don't like
[1:29:01] the way I've always
[1:29:02] been when I look at the Statue of a
[1:29:04] perfect man I see so many changes in my
[1:29:06] life but when I look at Christ I see so
[1:29:09] many more changes I need in my
[1:29:12] life and I I want them to change Lord
[1:29:16] I'm not looking for a passing
[1:29:20] grade I want a passing grade in the
[1:29:23] message message so I can go to heaven so
[1:29:26] I can make the
[1:29:27] Rapture I'm
[1:29:29] looking I I I want with all my heart to
[1:29:33] take the place and position he's given
[1:29:35] me and I want to work it with everything
[1:29:38] that's in me I want to give my whole
[1:29:40] self to it I want to be honest about it
[1:29:42] I want to be transparent I I I want to
[1:29:44] apply the word I want to call on God for
[1:29:46] help I want to press against the devil I
[1:29:49] want to do what he's given me to do and
[1:29:51] I want to be found faithful amen cuz
[1:29:55] that friends I believe is the
[1:29:56] responsibility of the
[1:29:59] adopted is to do what he's given us to
[1:30:03] do amen let's all Stand
[1:30:06] Together God bless
[1:30:08] youen thank you for your pull and your
[1:30:13] attentiveness
[1:30:14] amen this message is in a game Church
[1:30:18] isn't a game it's not a social club it's
[1:30:21] not something we do on the side
[1:30:24] this is the great work that God left for
[1:30:26] the end time to be made manifest to
[1:30:29] bring a people Amen to a position where
[1:30:33] they'll manifest where he can manifest
[1:30:34] himself again in Bride form amen and
[1:30:38] like I said before there's not one of us
[1:30:40] that's going to manifest all of that the
[1:30:41] closest came brother brandom he showed
[1:30:43] it in a form it was one vessel declaring
[1:30:45] to us what God was trying to do but now
[1:30:47] God has taken that manifestation and
[1:30:49] spread it out over all of
[1:30:51] us say well what am I supposed to do am
[1:30:53] I supposed to have visions am I supposed
[1:30:54] to heal no you're supposed to do
[1:30:56] whatever he's given you to
[1:30:58] do amen don't go take the ball out of
[1:31:00] somebody's hands don't try to invent
[1:31:02] something whatever you find in your hand
[1:31:04] to do do it with all of your might do it
[1:31:06] is unto the Lord do it according to the
[1:31:08] word and let everything that's not the
[1:31:10] word be driven away as you do what God's
[1:31:13] given you to do and if you do your part
[1:31:15] and I do my part and all the brothers
[1:31:18] around the world they do their part God
[1:31:20] is going to manifest himself upon this
[1:31:22] Earth because this message will produce
[1:31:25] what he sent it to produce I believe
[1:31:27] it's producing it but in order for it to
[1:31:30] produce it we're going to have to be
[1:31:31] real honest perseverant and
[1:31:35] faithful we're going to have to believe
[1:31:38] him and if we put something under
[1:31:41] tribute I think it's time to be honest
[1:31:43] about it just to be real
[1:31:46] honest say I've got a bragging Spirit
[1:31:49] I've got a lying spirit I exaggerate too
[1:31:51] much I I have resentment in my heart
[1:31:54] I've got bitterness I've got a temper I
[1:31:56] I I I've got a lust issue I I've got
[1:31:59] problems with entertainment I think it's
[1:32:01] time to be real say I put it under
[1:32:04] tribute but I'm sorry I'm breaking that
[1:32:07] Covenant with that thing amen you're
[1:32:08] evicted you get an eviction notice right
[1:32:12] now I think it's time to be honest
[1:32:14] friends because I believe that's the
[1:32:16] hour that we're living
[1:32:18] in man I want this vessel not to be
[1:32:21] given over to
[1:32:24] tribute for Devils to hide and old
[1:32:28] habits to
[1:32:29] remain I want it to be given over to the
[1:32:32] word and I want it to be a vessel that
[1:32:34] can be full of the word full of the Holy
[1:32:37] Ghost living the
[1:32:39] word will we be perfect no friends I'm
[1:32:42] not looking for that I just don't want
[1:32:44] any Canaanites under
[1:32:47] tribute amen will I mess up yeah I'll
[1:32:49] mess up but I'm not looking for
[1:32:52] something that I know there and just
[1:32:54] making a pack with it and leaving it
[1:32:55] alone because it's too hard I don't want
[1:32:57] to live like that
[1:32:59] anymore I want the word to live in

[1:33:21] Lord God we realize that this this is a
[1:33:24] great hour that we're living
[1:33:26] in but a great hour calls for great
[1:33:30] effort it calls for sacrifice
[1:33:34] honesty calls for a people who will be
[1:33:37] real and have a
[1:33:39] revelation having the mystery of your
[1:33:41] will revealed to us
[1:33:44] Lord God I believe you've been gracious
