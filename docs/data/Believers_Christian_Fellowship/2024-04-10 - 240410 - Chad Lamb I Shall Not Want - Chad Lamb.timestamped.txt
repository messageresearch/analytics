[12:53] to you Lord give our hearts to you and
[12:56] may may we receive that portion we have
[12:58] need of today today in Jesus Christ's
[13:01] name we pray
[13:03] amen amen God bless you while you're
[13:06] standing let's turn to First
[13:08] Peter First Peter chapter 2 uh while
[13:12] you're turning there I want to remind
[13:13] you that tomorrow night we'll pick back
[13:15] up in the church ages book Bible study
[13:17] here in the fellowship hall at 6:30 so
[13:20] it'll be good to get back into that also
[13:22] want to give you an update I forgot
[13:23] Sunday I was going to mention it but
[13:26] last Friday I I I went back to holes
[13:28] County to continue the Bible study there
[13:30] it was the first time I had been back I
[13:32] think in five weeks because of the trip
[13:33] to Australia but uh the day before I
[13:37] went uh brother um Ben Yoda you know
[13:40] Levi very well Levi's brother Ben who
[13:43] was baptized last time we had a Bible
[13:45] study heo his wife called to let me know
[13:47] his oldest daughter Maddie wanted to be
[13:48] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[13:51] so we baptized her at the beginning of
[13:52] the Bible study she's 13 years old and
[13:55] coming into that age of accountability
[13:57] and she was pricked in the heart and she
[13:59] wanted to be identified with Jesus
[14:01] Christ and so it was a real privilege to
[14:03] baptize her then at the end of the uh
[14:06] the Bible study there was a young man
[14:09] there that uh brother Arley had been
[14:11] witnessing to and he wanted to talk so
[14:14] we talked and he and his wife would like
[14:16] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[14:17] so he's asked if I'd stop on my next
[14:19] trip over I'll go early and stop and
[14:21] talk to him and if all goes well then
[14:23] maybe we'll baptize two more by the
[14:25] grace of God so we appreciate your
[14:27] prayers God is certain
[14:29] certainly doing a stirring amen we thank
[14:32] God for that and we pray that that God
[14:35] continues to have his way in all of
[14:37] that and while we're standing let's turn
[14:40] to First Peter chapter
[14:42] 2 and let's read uh verse
[14:46] 25 1
[14:48] Peter 2 and
[14:52] 25 for you were a sheep going astray but
[14:55] are now returned to the shepherd and
[14:58] Bishop of your soul souls and let's turn
[15:00] from there over to chapter
[15:04] 5 chapter 5
[15:07] verse4 and when the chief Shepherd shall
[15:10] appear you shall receive a Crown of
[15:12] Glory that fadeth not away man God bless
[15:15] you as you're
[15:17] seated
[15:19] amen so I hope you all had an
[15:21] opportunity to see the eclipse I was I
[15:25] thought it was a bunch of hype and
[15:26] overrated but when it came to it it was
[15:28] pretty amazing
[15:30] I was pretty shocked when I looked up
[15:31] there I said wow this is this is what is
[15:35] exciting I don't know that I'd go to
[15:36] another country to see it but I thank
[15:39] God it went right over our heads it was
[15:40] really a blessing and so it's amazing
[15:43] it's amazing amen that's all we can say
[15:45] that God's creation is absolutely
[15:47] amazing the way he's orchestrated and
[15:49] timed everything is amazing and I I
[15:53] thankful for the privilege to see it
[15:54] plus it was a beautiful day it was just
[15:56] a great excuse to be outside all day so
[15:58] we thank God for that so anyways it was
[16:01] a it was a good time when we get into
[16:04] the scriptures we just looked at I
[16:05] wanted to highlight here that we have a
[16:07] Shepherd that's what I really want to
[16:09] highlight we have a shepherd and Bishop
[16:11] of our souls and he is the chief
[16:13] Shepherd amen so we know there's other
[16:15] Shepherds but we're looking today to the
[16:17] chief Shepherd that's the one that that
[16:19] we want to look at and if we take that
[16:22] thought and go to Psalms 23 together I
[16:25] want to I want to read this scripture
[16:28] and and give get our text out of here
[16:31] for this
[16:34] evening Psalms
[16:42] 23 and we'll begin right at verse one
[16:45] and read the entire Psalm Psalm
[16:48] 23 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[16:51] want he maketh me to lie down in Green
[16:54] Pastures he leadth me beside Still
[16:56] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me
[16:59] in the paths of righteousness for his
[17:00] name's sake yay though I walk through
[17:03] the valley of the shadow of death I will
[17:05] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[17:07] rod and thy staff they comfort me thou
[17:10] preparest a table before me in the
[17:12] presence of my enemies thou anointed my
[17:14] head with oil my cup runneth over surely
[17:17] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[17:19] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[17:22] the house of the Lord forever amen this
[17:25] is
[17:26] wonderful but it starts off this is
[17:28] where I want to take my text uh the Lord
[17:31] is my shepherd I shall not want so I
[17:33] just took that for a title tonight I
[17:35] shall not want and it's
[17:38] really uh amazing the way this came to
[17:41] me I was just uh I I actually wasn't
[17:44] sitting and meditating I was actually
[17:46] laying down to sleep and as I was
[17:48] sleeping this thought came and I just
[17:49] started dwelling on it and I woke up in
[17:51] the morning and it was still there and
[17:52] all of a sudden it just materialized
[17:54] right before me I just begin to
[17:57] understand this in in a very uh maybe a
[18:00] unique way maybe not to you but to me in
[18:01] a unique way and and when we look at
[18:04] this I shall not want that word want
[18:06] means to lack to be without be lacking
[18:11] or have a need so he's saying the Lord
[18:14] is my shepherd I shall not want I shall
[18:17] not lack for anything and I shall not
[18:19] have a need why because I have a
[18:21] Shepherd I have the chief Shepherd is a
[18:23] good shepherd and he makes sure he
[18:25] provides for a sheep and so when I
[18:28] looked at that I realized for me this is
[18:32] something that needs to become a
[18:33] revelation that goes deeper in my heart
[18:35] because he says I shall not want not I
[18:38] may not want or I ought not to want but
[18:40] I shall not want and and I think we need
[18:43] to realize this as maybe a revelation
[18:46] and maybe a commandment also that that
[18:50] there's no way that I'm going to be
[18:51] lacking anything because I have a
[18:54] Shepherd I have a heavenly father I have
[18:56] a Shepherd I have a bridegroom I have a
[18:59] husband whatever title we look to him at
[19:01] the title speaks of
[19:03] provision he's a provider he's a savior
[19:06] he's a Healer he's a deliverer he's
[19:08] Jehovah Gyra he he's the one who sees
[19:11] the need and provides for the need and
[19:14] and the shepherd and we look at the
[19:15] Psalms it's the psalm of the shepherd
[19:17] the Good Shepherd uh the shepherd knows
[19:20] the needs of the sheep better than the
[19:22] Sheep all right the Sheep is a is a dumb
[19:26] animal it doesn't have the wit and
[19:28] intellect and intelligence of the
[19:30] shepherd and and and sheep I'm told I
[19:33] haven't raised them I don't know but
[19:35] I've told they're they're particularly
[19:40] stupid maybe that's why God chose them
[19:43] to represent us they're particularly bad
[19:47] at finding their own way particularly
[19:49] bad at leading themselves they're
[19:50] particularly bad at staying out of
[19:54] trouble I don't know if you find any
[19:56] consolation in that but I do
[19:59] cuz he's called me sheep so at least I
[20:01] match the description I mean at least
[20:04] the characteristics are there but it's
[20:07] the shepherd who's watching over the
[20:09] Sheep it's the shepherd who's providing
[20:11] security safety it's the shepherd who's
[20:14] making sure that the Sheep don't want
[20:17] don't lack don't have need and so I I
[20:21] need to come to this Revelation in my
[20:23] life because I I realize that so many
[20:27] times I
[20:29] I'm deceived and I'm taken down the road
[20:31] that I don't want to go because the
[20:33] devil trips me in believing that there's
[20:35] something I'm lacking when there's an
[20:37] impossibility for me to have
[20:41] lack amen you know when you think about
[20:43] this this is really just a simple
[20:45] subject I shall not want the Lord is my
[20:47] shepherd I shall not want it's so simple
[20:50] that you can teach it to the forign
[20:52] 5-year-old Sunday CL Sunday school class
[20:55] but the reality of letting this live in
[20:57] flesh is really really really
[20:58] complicated and deep it's like
[21:01] everything in the Bible once once God
[21:03] took the seals off of the book we began
[21:05] to see so much more than we ever seen
[21:08] before and sometimes the most Simple
[21:10] Things become the most
[21:12] profound the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[21:15] not want and he goes on to describe all
[21:18] the wonderful things he does he makes
[21:20] makes me lie down in Green Pastures mean
[21:23] he's not he's not he's bringing me to a
[21:26] place of rest but he's bringing me to a
[21:28] place of rest in the middle of abundance
[21:30] I'm in Green Pastures I'm not in dry
[21:32] scrub grass on Rocky ground in desert he
[21:35] he gives me rest in the midst of of a
[21:39] plentiful pastures he Le me beside Still
[21:44] Waters not dangerous torrents not
[21:46] currents not floods but still waters
[21:49] where I can I can I can quench my thirst
[21:52] easily this is the
[21:54] shepherd He restoreth my
[21:57] soul he leaded me in Paths of
[21:59] righteousness for his name's sake yay
[22:01] though I walk through the valley of the
[22:03] shadow of death I will not fear I will
[22:05] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[22:07] rod and thy staff they comfort me thou
[22:10] preparest a table before me in the
[22:12] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[22:14] my head with oil my cup runneth over in
[22:18] no way is this there's no way in a
[22:20] description of lack or barely enough or
[22:23] in some ways barely getting by that's
[22:25] not the picture because we have a
[22:27] shepherd
[22:29] amen surely goodness this is a statement
[22:32] a declaration surely with this kind of
[22:36] shepherd with his the way he watches
[22:38] over his sheep and with all his
[22:39] attributes surely goodness and mercy
[22:41] shall follow me all the days of my life
[22:44] and I will dwell in the house of the
[22:46] Lord
[22:47] forever so I love how he said surely
[22:49] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[22:51] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[22:54] the house of the Lord
[22:55] forever maybe goodness and mercy aren't
[22:59] necessarily what Leo deia considers
[23:01] goodness and
[23:03] mercy cuz he said surely goodness and
[23:06] mercy shall follow me oh so I can
[23:08] understand that Mercy is following me
[23:09] because if it wasn't for his Mercy
[23:10] following after me there would be no
[23:12] hope for me I need his Mercy but it's
[23:15] his goodness that's following after me
[23:17] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[23:18] after me all the days of my
[23:22] life so his goodness may not be uh
[23:26] supplying all the pleasures of leoda but
[23:28] it's still his goodness is there and
[23:30] you'll have need you'll have lack for
[23:33] nothing and then I will dwell in the
[23:35] house of the Lord forever that has
[23:39] nothing to do with leoda or worldly
[23:41] pleasures or Earthly
[23:43] gain so when we look at this this
[23:47] concept I shall not
[23:49] want it's
[23:52] emphatic I shall not
[23:55] want it's impossible for it to to be any
[23:58] other way I shall not want so we take it
[24:01] as an emphatic statement the Lord
[24:03] because the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[24:05] not want because he's a good
[24:08] shepherd he's not going to fail in his
[24:11] job to provide all that we
[24:13] need but also if I could take that for
[24:18] myself from my own perspective as a
[24:22] revelation not just as the emphatic
[24:24] statement but on my side if I could
[24:26] receive it as a revelation the Lord is
[24:29] my shepherd I'm not going to
[24:31] lack Heart come to peace because you're
[24:34] never going to do without surely
[24:36] goodness and mercy shall follow you all
[24:38] the days of your life and you'll dwell
[24:40] in the house of the Lord forever you're
[24:41] not going to miss out on anything you're
[24:43] not going to lack anything you're not
[24:45] going to be without what you need in
[24:47] this journey to fulfill God's purpose
[24:49] because the Lord is my
[24:52] shepherd and that's the Revelation that
[24:55] that the Lord was dealing with me in my
[24:57] heart I need that because we get anxious
[24:59] we get nervous and we get worried and we
[25:01] get upset about things we get depressed
[25:03] and we we feel we feel like things
[25:05] aren't working out but that's impossible
[25:08] because the Lord is my shepherd amen
[25:10] it's impossible that it's not working
[25:12] out it's impossible that my life is
[25:14] falling apart it's impossible that that
[25:17] that that it's not going to come to a
[25:19] good it's
[25:21] impossible because the Lord is my
[25:23] shepherd so I'm not looking at the in
[25:27] Psalms 23 there's nothing mentioned
[25:30] about the attributes of the sheep this
[25:32] is not based on the attributes of the
[25:33] sheep this is based on the the the this
[25:36] is based on the ability of the
[25:39] shepherd this is the competency of the
[25:42] shepherd not the ability of the sheep
[25:45] cuz remember they're particularly
[25:48] stupid especially
[25:54] so amen almighty God
[25:58] let's go to Philippians
[26:13] 4:19 it's amazing how much Revelation
[26:17] how much reality can come out of a
[26:19] little phrase the Lord is my shepherd I
[26:21] shall not want and I've known it since I
[26:24] was a little
[26:26] kid Philippians 4:19
[26:29] but my God shall supply all your need
[26:32] according to his riches and Glory by
[26:34] Christ
[26:35] Jesus I love that because it puts the
[26:38] emphasis in the right spot God shall
[26:41] supply all your needs according to his
[26:42] riches and
[26:44] Glory so what do you really
[26:46] need not so much the things that are on
[26:48] Earth but the things that come from
[26:50] Glory that's what we really
[26:53] need amen if we go to Second Peter turn
[26:57] together to Second p
[27:01] Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter
[27:08] 1 I've read this scripture a couple
[27:12] times in the last few times we preached
[27:13] but I I I keep wanting to go back to it
[27:16] and highlight it and in 2 Peter 1:3 it
[27:19] says according as his divine power ha
[27:21] given us all things that pertain unto
[27:24] life and godliness his power has already
[27:27] given us all things that pertained to
[27:30] life and
[27:32] godliness through the knowledge of him
[27:35] that ha called us to glory and virtue
[27:38] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[27:40] great and precious promises that by
[27:42] these the promises you might be
[27:44] partakers of the divine nature having
[27:46] escaped the corruption that is in the
[27:48] world through lust amen this is the fa
[27:51] statement I want to pay some attention
[27:53] to the corruption that is in the world
[27:55] through lust you've heard me say this
[27:57] before but the corruption entered in how
[28:00] did the corruption come into the world
[28:01] through
[28:04] lust this word lust means desire craving
[28:07] longing and it can even be a desire for
[28:10] what is forbidden and that's a lust so
[28:13] so it's a it's a craving a longing a
[28:15] desire and also a desire for what's
[28:18] forbidden and when we go all the way
[28:22] back to Genesis in Genesis 3:6 when when
[28:27] the serpent now now is beginning to
[28:29] beguile he's beginning to entice the
[28:32] woman it it he he he begins to show her
[28:36] that there's more there's more that you
[28:38] can have and when you when you go back
[28:41] to the Garden of Eden and you realize
[28:43] the state that Adam and his wife were in
[28:47] they were that the Lord was their
[28:48] Shepherd and they didn't
[28:50] want they were in the beginning of
[28:52] Psalms 23 they he the Lord is my
[28:55] shepherd I shall not want that's where
[28:57] they were in the Garden of Eden they
[28:59] were laying in Green Pastures they were
[29:01] resting in Green Pastures they were they
[29:03] were led by The Still Waters they were
[29:05] Anointed with oil they they they
[29:08] everything was perfect they had no want
[29:11] they had no lack they had no need they
[29:13] didn't need anything amen and so in
[29:16] order for the devil to bring a deception
[29:18] amen he's got to all of a sudden begin
[29:20] to break the revelation of Eve about her
[29:24] Shepherd and begins to be put a wedge
[29:26] here between the shepherd supplying and
[29:29] Eve
[29:31] wanting because now she's going to
[29:34] desire something amen she's going to
[29:37] desire more than what God's given her
[29:39] and I'm telling you if we ever get to
[29:41] this place where we begin to desire more
[29:43] than what's given we're on Dangerous
[29:45] Ground that's the playground for The
[29:46] Devil because we we you know what we
[29:49] only need we only need what he supplies
[29:51] we should only want what he supplies if
[29:53] God would help us to tame this flesh of
[29:56] ours to where we can get to where I only
[29:58] desire what he's
[30:01] provided what has he provided all that
[30:03] you
[30:05] need
[30:07] everything it's provided ACC according
[30:09] to his riches and
[30:11] glory and so
[30:13] now now when he begins to entice her she
[30:18] she doesn't want for anything nothing
[30:22] there's not a thing there's not a thing
[30:25] in creation there is not a thing outside
[30:27] of creation that she needs she has no
[30:30] need she doesn't need anything God has
[30:33] provided everything and everything that
[30:35] God will provide is exactly as
[30:38] needed you got
[30:41] that so the enemy comes in and he starts
[30:45] to entice Her starts to show that
[30:47] there's more you can have something more
[30:50] you can be like Gods knowing good and
[30:51] evil and now all of a sudden she begins
[30:54] to desire something more than what God
[30:57] has given
[30:58] given so how did corruption enter the
[31:00] world through lust she had a longing for
[31:03] a craving brother Benham said she didn't
[31:05] mean to do that she didn't know but she
[31:07] wanted to know she didn't understand but
[31:09] she wanted to understand but God didn't
[31:11] want her to understand he just wanted
[31:13] her to
[31:14] obey God had provided everything for her
[31:18] and now as the serpent comes in and
[31:19] begins to offer her something you know
[31:22] what he's offering her he's offering her
[31:23] something ahead of
[31:26] schedule it's not that God won't won't
[31:28] give her everything she desires amen and
[31:30] not that God will not will will not
[31:32] provide everything she needs but he's
[31:35] going to do it according to his riches
[31:36] and Glory not according to her fleshly
[31:39] desire but according to his riches and
[31:41] Glory so now the Devil comes in and he
[31:44] starts to create a desire for something
[31:47] more than what God's offered that's
[31:49] right and it doesn't mean that it's not
[31:51] going to come later this is out of
[31:53] season out of kilter out of
[31:55] time amen
[31:58] because everything she needed he
[32:00] provided right and when she needed it he
[32:02] would provide it right
[32:06] yes God had promised yes sir God had
[32:10] promised yes sir that it was in the plan
[32:13] of God Amen that Adam was to reproduce
[32:17] himself is that right but God gave him a
[32:21] wife to reproduce
[32:24] himself right is that true amen God gave
[32:29] and so the whole purpose of God
[32:31] separating Adam and bringing him
[32:32] together was to reproduce himself so God
[32:35] God provided what Adam needed to
[32:37] reproduce himself because God provides
[32:39] everything that's
[32:41] needed but what they didn't yet have was
[32:43] the Revelation or their permission or
[32:45] something I don't I'm not going to I'm
[32:47] not going to venture without Authority I
[32:48] don't know something was preventing amen
[32:51] the reproduction of Adam whether it was
[32:53] a lack of Revelation understanding or
[32:55] permission however it works a amen there
[32:58] was a there was a limitation it wasn't
[33:00] God's time or season amen so now the
[33:02] Devil comes in and starts to entice her
[33:04] with an understanding giving her a
[33:06] desire for something that's outside the
[33:09] boundaries that God has
[33:13] placed amen there's a big debate
[33:15] sometimes and the debate is how would
[33:18] Pro procreation taken place because
[33:21] brother bam says you can take quotes and
[33:23] you can find where he says both
[33:25] ways like it would have been something
[33:27] super Supernatural or it would have been
[33:29] something very natural the way
[33:30] procreation is done today and brother
[33:32] bam says it emphatically both ways you
[33:34] can make you could come up with quotes
[33:36] and we can argue all day and people have
[33:37] asked me all the time do you think it
[33:39] was how do you think it would have
[33:41] happened and I used to get on that
[33:44] debate and I would read all the quotes
[33:46] I've read from the beginning to the end
[33:48] every quote that I could find on that
[33:50] subject I don't say every quote because
[33:53] there's some I may not have read but
[33:54] every one that I could find and read it
[33:56] and reread it and reread it and and as
[33:59] I'm reading through I got to figure out
[34:01] this is the way he would have done it it
[34:03] would have been by natural processes and
[34:05] then all of a sudden I read something
[34:06] else and I come over here and I thought
[34:08] no there's no way it would have never
[34:09] happened that way because that's not
[34:10] God's original plan according to what
[34:12] brother brandham
[34:15] said I hope I'm not making you
[34:20] nervous because I'm going to give you my
[34:24] conclusion my conclusion is it's a
[34:27] worthless argument and a complete waste
[34:29] of
[34:30] time because nothing was going to happen
[34:33] differently than it
[34:39] happened you talk about asking what
[34:41] would have happened with the plan of God
[34:44] was there really a would have as if God
[34:47] didn't know what was going to happen you
[34:49] can say well I've read enough quotes and
[34:51] I've determined in 65 he says this but
[34:53] there's 15 times more he says this than
[34:55] he says this and I've come to the it's
[34:57] an absolute waste of your energy is not
[35:00] worth talking about because these things
[35:02] there's nothing out of kilter with the
[35:04] program of God everything's ticking
[35:06] right on time everything happened the
[35:08] way it was supposed to happen you say
[35:09] then it was right no it was wrong what
[35:11] made it wrong because it was a wrong
[35:13] time or without I don't know what made
[35:15] it wrong but it was wrong the way it
[35:18] happened so there's no reason to to
[35:21] worry there's no reason to debate God
[35:23] knew what was going to happen before the
[35:24] foundation of the
[35:26] world
[35:30] oh the things I have wasted my life on
[35:33] trying to figure out things that you're
[35:35] never going to figure out you're never
[35:37] going to answer this question
[35:39] conclusively without some little other
[35:41] quote or question and there's there's
[35:43] something that I've come to terms with
[35:44] amen no matter how many quotes you find
[35:46] there's always another
[35:48] quote
[35:50] always why CU this is a walk of
[35:54] Faith so now we come we come back to to
[35:57] the subject that was a quite a Divergent
[35:59] I'm
[36:01] sorry but when it when I came to that
[36:03] conclusion I was so free am there's no
[36:07] reason to try to figure out what are you
[36:08] going to figure out you're trying to
[36:10] figure out what wasn't in God's
[36:18] mind praise God you can argue with me
[36:21] about it afterwards but I'm not I'm too
[36:23] tired to argue I give up I just say all
[36:26] things work together for good it's as it
[36:30] needs to be it's according to God's plan
[36:34] I don't know what else to say and then
[36:36] you I'll send you somewhere else to
[36:38] argue with other people who like to
[36:40] argue I don't have energy for it
[36:44] anymore so so whatever was going to
[36:48] happen in whatever
[36:49] way the devil was trying to create a
[36:52] desire in her for something that was
[36:55] outside the limitation God had placed
[36:58] so the limitation that God placed when
[37:01] God placed the limitation what it meant
[37:04] was she didn't need it right
[37:07] then that's what it meant she didn't
[37:10] need it right then she didn't need to
[37:12] know she didn't need to understand she
[37:14] didn't know but she wanted to know she
[37:15] didn't understand but she wanted to
[37:17] understand amen so there was no need for
[37:20] her to know at that time but the devil
[37:22] was trying to entice her and so
[37:24] corruption entered by her own lusts
[37:28] yes if she could have just kept herself
[37:31] out of it everything would have worked
[37:32] out
[37:34] perfect right but she had to enter
[37:38] herself into the
[37:40] equation amen let's go to James chapter
[37:53] 1 James chapter
[37:56] 1
[38:02] James chap 1:
[38:06] 13 says let no man say when he is
[38:09] tempted I am tempted of God for God
[38:11] cannot be tempted with evil neither
[38:12] tempteth he any man but every man is
[38:15] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[38:18] lust and
[38:20] enticed that word enticed is interesting
[38:22] I looked it up in the concordance and it
[38:24] means bait on a hook that's the actual
[38:27] description they write under it bait on
[38:29] a hook boy is that not a
[38:31] visual what's the bait on the hook your
[38:34] own lust your own desire your own
[38:36] craving is the bait on the
[38:39] hook amen but every man is tempted when
[38:41] he has drawn away of his own lust and
[38:44] deceived I'm sorry and enticed and when
[38:47] lust hath conceived it bringeth forth
[38:49] sin and sin when it is finished bringeth
[38:51] forth death that's exactly the pattern
[38:54] we saw in Genesis chapter 3 in the
[38:56] Garden of Eden that's what we saw take
[38:58] place let's go over to John let's just
[39:00] turn a few books over to the Book of
[39:03] John 1 John chapter
[39:11] two 1 John chapter 2:1
[39:17] 15 love not the world neither the things
[39:20] that are in the world for If any man
[39:23] love the world the love of the father is
[39:25] not in him for all that is in the world
[39:27] world the lust of the flesh the lust of
[39:30] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[39:32] the father but is of the
[39:35] world the lust of the eyes the lust of
[39:38] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[39:40] pride of life amen those were the three
[39:42] things that tripped up uh the woman in
[39:45] the Garden of Eden tripped up Eve and
[39:48] she saw that the tree was pleasant to
[39:51] the eyes she saw that it was good for
[39:54] food and a tree to make one wise the
[39:56] lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh
[39:58] and the pride of life and and that uh
[40:01] John is telling us that's all that's in
[40:03] the world that's the that's that's
[40:05] describing the world Amen it's your own
[40:08] lust it's a craving for something uh uh
[40:11] beyond what God has given amen and so
[40:14] that that then becomes dangerous that
[40:17] then becomes I should say wrong if I
[40:20] could say it that
[40:21] way I mean we used to think being wrong
[40:25] with smoking and drinking committing
[40:26] adultery and run running around and
[40:27] going to bars and and all those were
[40:29] wrong and stealing and cheating on your
[40:31] taxes but maybe wrong is is maybe it's
[40:34] different than what we thought
[40:35] altogether maybe really when we get down
[40:37] to the core of wrong core is anything I
[40:40] desire outside what God desires for me
[40:44] maybe that's what wrong is maybe wrong
[40:46] is so much closer than I ever dreamed
[40:49] wrong because I can I can not smoke and
[40:52] drink and run around and cheat on my
[40:53] taxes and do all that but still I'm
[40:55] lusting I'm Desiring to have my way I
[40:58] want and I need and I have to have and
[41:01] I'll work to go get something that I
[41:03] want and the question is what is God
[41:06] giving me because I have a shepherd I
[41:08] shall not
[41:09] want so what is all this craving and
[41:12] lusting and and and in the lust of the
[41:14] eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride
[41:15] of life amen it it's the thing that's
[41:18] actually the world we say I I I'm I'm a
[41:21] believer I'm a Christian I'm not in the
[41:23] world I didn't go to the world well if
[41:25] you've got the lust of the eyes the lust
[41:27] of the flesh and pride of life you're in
[41:28] the world that is the world all that is
[41:31] in the world is the lust of the flesh
[41:32] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[41:34] life amen maybe what I need to do is
[41:36] come back to being a sheep and
[41:38] recognizing that everything that I need
[41:40] the shepherd's
[41:43] provided oh God help us God help us amen
[41:46] we're we're going to have to grow up
[41:48] before we get out of here it's going to
[41:50] have to happen we're going to have to
[41:52] grow up and quit being children when
[41:55] Jesus was here amen he was the perfect
[41:57] man he was the last Adam he was the son
[42:00] another Son of God that had come amen
[42:02] without sex birth the first Adam came
[42:04] without sex birth amen so he wasn't part
[42:06] of the fall but yet he fell and so now
[42:09] there has to be another another Son of
[42:12] God that comes outside the failure of
[42:15] the Fall so that he could redeem back
[42:17] everything that Adam lost so here comes
[42:20] Jesus Christ now without sex birth so
[42:22] now he's not subject to the fall now
[42:24] he's here but he's got to go through the
[42:26] same testings that they were tested by
[42:28] in the Garden of Eden so now what does
[42:31] God do now when he receives the Holy
[42:33] Ghost he's led by the Holy Ghost out
[42:35] into the Wilderness to be tempted by the
[42:37] devil and what does the devil do he
[42:39] replicates the three great Temptations
[42:41] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[42:43] Flesh and the pride of
[42:46] life let's read that in Matthew 4 let's
[42:48] go together over to Matthew chapter
[42:56] 4
[43:01] remember before a Passover Lamb could be
[43:03] taken and used as a Passover Lamb which
[43:07] Jesus Christ was the Passover Lamb it
[43:10] had to be taken and put up for a while
[43:12] to be inspected to make sure there was
[43:14] no flaw in that there was no sickness
[43:16] there was no flaw there no de deformity
[43:19] it had to be a perfect lamb so Jesus
[43:21] before he could go to Calvary he has to
[43:23] First be tested he has to be put up and
[43:25] inspected to make sure he is the perfect
[43:28] Passover Lamb so now part of this
[43:31] inspection is taking place in Matthew
[43:33] chapter 4 and it says
[43:37] here Matthew 4:1 then was Jesus led up
[43:41] of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be
[43:43] tempted of the devil and when he had
[43:44] fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was
[43:46] afterward hungered I want you to catch
[43:49] this brother BR points this out so good
[43:51] he said Jesus wasn't hungry in his fast
[43:53] because when God puts a fast on you you
[43:55] don't even
[43:56] hunger so he says now but after 40 days
[43:59] of no food now he's hungry and the
[44:02] question is how hungry do you think he
[44:05] was his body had been 40 days with no
[44:09] food amen so he fasted 40 days with
[44:12] nothing to eat while he was fasting he
[44:14] felt no hunger but now at the end of 40
[44:17] days he hungered so then God removed the
[44:19] barrier amen now he felt everything the
[44:22] humans feel how hungry do you think he
[44:26] was I can tell you how hungry I'd
[44:31] be and it
[44:33] says he was afterward of hunger and when
[44:36] the tempter came to him he said if thou
[44:38] be the Son of God command the stones to
[44:39] be made bread but he answered said it is
[44:42] written man shall not live by bread
[44:44] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[44:46] out of the mouth of
[44:48] God what is Jesus
[44:51] doing he's refusing to
[44:56] lust amen amen you know what he's saying
[45:00] I don't need bread all I need is the
[45:02] word of
[45:04] God his body signaling to him he needs
[45:08] food he's in a human body brother benam
[45:11] said he was completely man and
[45:12] completely God Amen he got tired and
[45:16] went to sleep he got hungry he got ate
[45:18] he thirsty he was completely manad and
[45:20] so now his body saying you need food you
[45:22] need food and the devil's tempting him
[45:25] Amen to turn stones into bread and he's
[45:27] saying I don't need food all I need is
[45:30] the word of
[45:32] God this is our example
[45:35] friends now let's go to let's go to
[45:38] verse five then the devil taketh him up
[45:40] into the holy city and Seth him on the
[45:41] Pinnacle of the temple and sayith and
[45:43] him if thou be the Son of God cast
[45:45] thyself down for it is written he shall
[45:47] give his angels charge concerning thee
[45:49] and in their hands shallal thou bear
[45:50] thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy
[45:52] foot against the stone and Jesus said un
[45:55] them it is written again Thou shalt not
[45:57] tempt the Lord thy God he said I have
[45:59] nothing to prove and I don't need to
[46:01] prove anything in this body and I don't
[46:03] need to protect it I don't need to prove
[46:05] anything to you
[46:07] amen again the devil takeen him up into
[46:09] the exceeding high mountain and showed
[46:10] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[46:12] the glory of them and saith unto him all
[46:14] these things will I give to thee if thou
[46:16] will fall down and worship me then saith
[46:18] Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for
[46:20] it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[46:22] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[46:24] serve then the devil leaveth him and
[46:26] behold Angels Came and ministered unto
[46:32] him three Temptations all that's in the
[46:35] world lust of the eyes lust of the flesh
[46:36] pride of life the three temptations that
[46:38] tempted Eve she saw that was good for
[46:40] food she Pleasant to the eyes one to
[46:42] make one wise Here Comes Jesus and the
[46:44] tempter comes and tempts him and you
[46:45] know what Jesus proves I don't need
[46:47] anything you offer everything I need
[46:50] comes from my heavenly father I don't
[46:52] need to prove anything I don't need to
[46:54] defend myself I don't need to convince
[46:56] you of anything I don't need to eat all
[46:58] I need is the word of God and all I need
[47:00] to stay with the word of God and God
[47:02] will supply all of my needs according to
[47:04] his riches and glory and if God hasn't
[47:06] given it I don't need it if he hasn't
[47:10] given it he hasn't commanded it he
[47:11] hasn't spoken it then I don't need
[47:14] it that's what Jesus was proving when he
[47:17] was when he was going when he was
[47:19] reversing when he was tested and proving
[47:22] that he was here to be the perfect land
[47:24] he had to stand the test of Eden but
[47:26] when he stood the test of Eden he
[47:28] couldn't stand what e he could stand
[47:30] what Eve could not stand Now Eve herself
[47:33] desired something and she can never
[47:35] subject her own fleshly desire her own
[47:38] need to know her own want she can never
[47:41] subject it to the word of God and say
[47:43] serpent I don't care how bad I would
[47:45] like to know what you're talking about
[47:47] how bad I would like to discover a
[47:49] furtherance of God's word how bad I
[47:51] would like to know what's behind the
[47:53] veil what's sealed behind the seal no
[47:55] matter how bad I would like to know know
[47:57] that God
[47:59] said and if God said and God didn't give
[48:02] then I don't need anything but what God
[48:06] said that's where he failed that's where
[48:09] Jesus
[48:11] succeeded but verse 11 is the one that
[48:13] Thrills my
[48:15] heart then the devil leaveth him and
[48:18] behold Angels Came and ministered unto
[48:20] him do you think God didn't provide
[48:22] everything he
[48:25] needed
[48:28] remember in the midst of the Temptation
[48:29] where are you God why am I alone why God
[48:32] was watching the sun everything had to
[48:35] happen this has to take place because
[48:37] the lamb has to be tested he's got to be
[48:39] tested the same way if he can't overcome
[48:42] what he failed to overcome then he can't
[48:44] wash away with his blood the iniquity of
[48:47] that sin amen so now he's got to be
[48:49] tested the father can't withhold this
[48:51] test from him because it's part of his
[48:53] riches and glory amen right but God's
[48:57] not unmindful of where he's at God's not
[49:00] lost sight of his son he's not a bad
[49:02] Shepherd amen the shepherd knows that
[49:04] this needs to take place but as soon as
[49:07] he passes the test what does he do he
[49:09] sends the Angels down to minister unto
[49:12] him because he's a good shepherd he's a
[49:15] good father he's a good husband he knows
[49:17] and he sends just what Jesus need just
[49:20] when he he needed
[49:24] it praise be to God
[49:29] the devil trips us up with
[49:31] hopelessness with wondering where God is
[49:33] with thinking our trial will never end
[49:36] with believing that there's no way out
[49:39] and and then then starting to work on a
[49:42] pride of life or the lust of the flesh
[49:44] or trying to save ourselves or the lust
[49:46] of eyes try to provide a want and he
[49:48] starts working on that and we think that
[49:51] now we got to make something happen cuz
[49:52] nothing's happening if nothing's
[49:54] happening nothing needs to happen
[49:57] this is the point that I need to come to
[49:59] when nothing's happening nothing needs
[50:00] to happen why do I feel anxious that I
[50:03] got to move God's program along why do I
[50:05] think I've got to bump it into some
[50:06] progress what am I going to do I'm going
[50:09] through my own lust and my own desire to
[50:11] fulfill my own wants I'm going to ruin
[50:13] the whole program that God has for me
[50:15] and I'm going to bring suffering upon
[50:17] myself because if God didn't provide it
[50:19] and if God didn't allow it then I don't
[50:21] need
[50:24] it God help me to grow in this let's
[50:28] jump over to Matthew 6 while we're here
[50:30] in Matthew let's go to 6 chapter 6 verse
[50:38] 25 therefore I say unto you take no
[50:42] thought for your life what you shall eat
[50:43] or what you shall drink nor yet for your
[50:45] body what you shall put on is not life
[50:47] more than meat and the body than rment
[50:50] behold the fowls of the air for they sow
[50:52] not neither do they reap nor gather into
[50:54] barns yet your heavenly father feated
[50:57] them are you not much better than they
[50:59] what a
[51:02] question which of You by taking thought
[51:04] can add one cubit to a stature and why
[51:07] take you thought for rment consider the
[51:08] lies of the field how they grow they
[51:10] toil not neither do they spend and yet I
[51:13] say unto you that even Solomon in all
[51:15] his glory was not AR raid like one of
[51:17] these wherefore have God so clothed the
[51:19] grass of the field which today is and
[51:21] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[51:23] not much more clothe you oh ye of little
[51:26] faith am therefore take no thought
[51:29] saying what shall we eat or what shall
[51:31] we drink or what with shall we be
[51:32] clothed for after all these things do
[51:34] the Gentiles seek for your heavenly
[51:36] father knoweth that you have need of all
[51:39] these things but seek ye first the
[51:42] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[51:45] all these things shall be added unto you
[51:49] take therefore no thought for the
[51:50] tomorrow for the tomorrow shall take
[51:52] thought for the things of itself
[51:53] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[51:55] thereof
[51:58] we all know that's true every one of us
[52:01] know that's true you knew the scripture
[52:03] before I read it you've all read it
[52:05] you've all heard it you all know it's
[52:08] true why in the world is this so hard
[52:10] for
[52:12] us I'll tell you why because of
[52:15] self our enemy is
[52:19] self Eve's enemy was
[52:23] herself our enemy is ourselves that's
[52:27] why it's so
[52:28] hard it's
[52:32] amazing I wrote down some questions just
[52:34] to ask
[52:36] myself what do you
[52:38] need what do I
[52:41] need then the next question was what has
[52:44] he failed to
[52:49] provide now when you ask the SWAT second
[52:51] question it helps answer the first
[52:54] question cuz I said what do you need you
[52:56] can think well I I'm my car needs
[52:58] upgraded it's not running very well and
[53:00] the furnace is acting up and the gutters
[53:02] hanging out the side and and uh I'm not
[53:05] feeling too well right now what do you
[53:07] need but then when you ask the question
[53:09] what has he failed to
[53:11] provide say oh I don't need
[53:14] anything because now I realize that my
[53:18] constant need and my whining and my
[53:20] complaining and feel like God's not
[53:21] providing and nothing's right for me and
[53:23] I don't ever get a break and and and it
[53:25] works for everybody else and it doesn't
[53:26] does work for me what I'm doing is I'm
[53:28] declaring that my shepherd's failing
[53:30] he's not doing a good job he's not very
[53:32] watchful he's not powerful and he
[53:34] doesn't know where I'm at he's lost
[53:36] sight of me I'm a sheep wandering around
[53:38] with no
[53:40] Shepherd and what what a terrible what a
[53:44] terrible way to characterize your great
[53:46] Shepherd the chief
[53:51] Shepherd the next question I wrote is
[53:54] there something I want that he he is not
[54:00] providing now we're all scared of death
[54:02] to answer Even in our minds we're trying
[54:03] to keep our minds
[54:05] blank I'm not thinking
[54:09] anything maybe it's a lust and not a
[54:14] need maybe it's a lust and a not a maybe
[54:17] we think we need it but maybe he knows
[54:21] we
[54:24] don't there is No Lack in his
[54:28] kingdom the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[54:31] not
[54:34] want for the Chad should we ask for
[54:36] Stuff of
[54:38] course ask ask that your joy might be
[54:41] full you have not because you ask not
[54:43] ask he's invited us to ask but when he
[54:46] asks let him answer and let him provide
[54:50] and let him tell us what we do and don't
[54:51] need
[54:53] ask remember when David and David took B
[54:56] Sheba in adultery and she became
[54:58] pregnant and she she had a son but as
[55:00] part of the punishment a part of the
[55:02] curse that he brought upon himself that
[55:03] first son was going to die and look at
[55:05] what David does David goes in fasting
[55:07] and supplication and prayer and he lays
[55:09] on the dirt before the Lord the entire
[55:12] time I think it was seven days or so
[55:13] that that child was sick he would take
[55:15] no food and he was constantly asking God
[55:18] would you please chave the child would
[55:20] you please save the child would you
[55:21] please save the child he wasn't listen
[55:23] he wasn't taking a a a a halfhazard
[55:26] attitude like well if God wants to save
[55:28] him he'll be saved if God doesn't want
[55:29] to save me he won't be saved no he was
[55:31] he was fervently praying he got down on
[55:33] his face he was desperate for God to
[55:35] save this child's life and and for seven
[55:38] days no food nothing he laid on his face
[55:41] and WPT before the Lord asking God to
[55:43] save this child but after the the
[55:45] whatever period of time it was when the
[55:47] child died the servants saw his distress
[55:50] and his fervency and his anguish and
[55:52] prayer they were scared to tell him that
[55:53] the child had passed away and so he
[55:55] could hear the whisperings around him
[55:57] and he assumed that he knew what was
[55:59] happening he got up and he asked them
[56:01] and they told him the child is dead and
[56:03] they were amazed because immediately he
[56:05] washed himself changed His Garment sat
[56:07] down and asked him to bring him
[56:09] something to
[56:12] eat what's wrong with this man this is
[56:15] what they're looking at what is wrong
[56:17] why why were you so heartbroken and so
[56:19] fervent and Desiring God to move and
[56:21] then when the child dies that's when we
[56:24] usually start mourning and start weep in
[56:26] and start begging
[56:28] and but David knew that God had just
[56:33] answered and David was content with the
[56:39] answer he got up and he washed himself
[56:43] yes anointed himself changed His Garment
[56:46] and got something to eat and he says
[56:48] God's answered now I can't he can't come
[56:51] to me but I can go to him he never lost
[56:55] sight of God and he never felt like God
[56:57] failed him God never failed him he knew
[56:59] that child was waiting over in glory for
[57:01] him and he would see him one day because
[57:03] David wasn't living for his own fleshly
[57:05] desires he hadn't lost sight that
[57:07] there's a God and there's a program of
[57:09] God he kept it all in perspective did he
[57:11] ask he asked should he have asked he
[57:13] should have asked somebody's got to ask
[57:16] somebody's got to intercede somebody's
[57:17] got to pray but when God has answered
[57:20] what do we do once God answers we say
[57:22] blessed be the name of the Lord the lord
[57:24] giveth the lord taketh away
[57:26] blessed be the name of the
[57:29] Lord what else can we do insult his
[57:33] character make
[57:40] accusations I don't want to accuse my
[57:42] god of failing
[57:44] me he can't
[57:47] fail I don't want to accuse my god of
[57:49] not caring how can he not
[57:51] care he is
[57:55] love
[57:57] let's turn to Philippians together
[58:00] Philippians chapter
[58:03] 4 you see how such a little thought a
[58:05] little simple scripture we probably
[58:08] learned it as children if you went to
[58:09] church when you were a child it's so
[58:12] much more than we ever
[58:14] thought it's the problem it's the
[58:17] solution to the
[58:20] problem Philippians chapter
[58:24] 4 verse 6
[58:29] be careful for nothing that means
[58:31] anxious or worried be careful for
[58:34] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[58:36] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[58:38] request be made known unto God and the
[58:40] peace of God which passes all
[58:42] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[58:44] Minds through Christ
[58:46] Jesus he never said he's going to give
[58:48] you everything you ever asked
[58:50] for amen but
[58:53] if if you're not anxious for anything
[58:55] with with prayer and supplication with
[58:57] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[58:59] known to God the peace of God what will
[59:02] he guarantee to give you his
[59:04] peace and
[59:06] everything the peace of God which passes
[59:09] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[59:11] and Minds through Christ
[59:14] Jesus which would you rather have
[59:17] everything you ever asked for or the
[59:19] peace of
[59:21] God which is going to carry us further
[59:23] in life every request we make or the
[59:27] peace of
[59:29] God if we can come the right way he's
[59:32] promised us
[59:33] peace Jesus came and never took the bait
[59:36] and never took his own way and never
[59:38] succumbed to the lust of the Flesh and
[59:39] God provided the angels to minister to
[59:42] him I believe God will provide angels to
[59:44] minister to us if we come the right
[59:48] way Philippians 4:10 let's go down a
[59:51] little further but I rejoice in the Lord
[59:53] greatly that now at the last your care
[59:55] of me hath flourished again they sent
[59:57] him they sent him material Goods they
[59:59] sent him finances wherein you were also
[1:00:02] careful but you lacked
[1:00:04] opportunity not that I speak in respect
[1:00:06] of want for I have learned in whatsoever
[1:00:09] State I am therewith to be content I
[1:00:12] love how the Apostle Paul says I'm so
[1:00:14] thankful that you were finally able to
[1:00:16] get some funds to me and not that you
[1:00:18] ever didn't want to but you didn't have
[1:00:20] opportunity but I'm not asking as though
[1:00:21] I wanted anything because I only want
[1:00:23] what God gives am amen
[1:00:26] I love this I speak in resp not that I
[1:00:29] speak in respect of one for I have
[1:00:31] learned in whatsoever State I am
[1:00:33] therewith to be content praise God I
[1:00:37] know both how to be abased and I know
[1:00:39] how to abound it means I I know how not
[1:00:41] to have any money and I know what it's
[1:00:43] like to have some
[1:00:45] money everywhere and in all things I am
[1:00:48] instructed both to be full and to be
[1:00:49] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[1:00:52] I can do all things through Christ which
[1:00:54] strengtheneth me
[1:00:56] there's another
[1:00:58] key there's another key how can I
[1:01:02] survive hunger how can I take lack when
[1:01:05] I don't have enough money amen that you
[1:01:08] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:01:10] There Is No Lack so when there's not
[1:01:12] what I think enough funds to do what I
[1:01:14] need to do I can do all things through
[1:01:16] Christ who strengthens me he supplies
[1:01:18] the strength he supplies the peace that
[1:01:20] passes understanding he sends angels to
[1:01:22] minister God will get me through every
[1:01:24] trial there's things that we have to go
[1:01:27] through in life there's trials there's
[1:01:28] Temptations there's testings they're
[1:01:30] proving so that we can learn the grace
[1:01:32] of God you have to go through a trial to
[1:01:35] understand God's deliverance and God's
[1:01:37] power amen and we we have to go through
[1:01:39] these things and sometimes we have to go
[1:01:41] through them so that we can display
[1:01:42] Christ as somebody else who's watching
[1:01:43] our trial we have you're not going to
[1:01:47] bypass it it was predestinated before
[1:01:49] the foundation of the world and you're
[1:01:50] not going to pray it away but if you can
[1:01:52] make your request known with
[1:01:54] supplication and than Thanksgiving then
[1:01:56] he will give you peace that passes
[1:01:59] understanding and his strength he'll
[1:02:00] give you strength to Bear all
[1:02:05] things I know how to be full and I'm
[1:02:08] instructed to be hungry how to abound
[1:02:10] and how to suffer
[1:02:13] need I can do all things through Christ
[1:02:15] which strengtheneth me you know I've
[1:02:18] seen that written out I can do all
[1:02:20] things through Christ me all things all
[1:02:22] things all things and somehow the way
[1:02:24] it's used you think that you you you can
[1:02:26] speak you can speak things into
[1:02:28] existence and move them out he's saying
[1:02:30] I know how to do without and I know how
[1:02:32] to be hungry and I know how not to have
[1:02:35] all my physical needs met that's what
[1:02:37] that scripture is referring
[1:02:40] to we look at it one way because the
[1:02:42] Christian World uses it a way and they
[1:02:44] put it on signs and they make it look
[1:02:45] like it's one thing but the reality is
[1:02:48] the strength I need is the strength to
[1:02:50] suffer through when it's time for
[1:02:52] suffering when it's time for not having
[1:02:54] everything when it's time for a little
[1:02:55] little distress amen then I can do all
[1:02:58] things through his strength that
[1:02:59] strengthened me Christ that strengthens
[1:03:01] me that's the application of the
[1:03:09] scripture oh praise
[1:03:12] God let's go to 1 Timothy
[1:03:19] 6 1 Timothy 6 and verse
[1:03:24] 6
[1:03:30] 1 Timothy
[1:03:32] 66 but godliness with contentment is
[1:03:35] great
[1:03:36] gain for we brought nothing into this
[1:03:39] world and it is certain we can carry
[1:03:41] nothing out and having food and
[1:03:44] reignment let us be therewith
[1:03:47] content oh boy that's such an easy one
[1:03:50] to write on your refrigerator put it on
[1:03:52] a sticking note stick it on the
[1:03:53] refrigerator you know what that's a hard
[1:03:55] one to live
[1:03:58] that's a hard one to
[1:04:02] live you know
[1:04:04] you when you just think about
[1:04:07] life it's not always
[1:04:10] easy it's not always
[1:04:12] simple the Temptation in the wilderness
[1:04:15] wasn't
[1:04:16] easy our trials and and the things that
[1:04:19] we have that's ordained for us to go
[1:04:21] through it's not simple it's not easy
[1:04:24] but I can do all things things through
[1:04:26] Christ who strengthens me he can give me
[1:04:29] peace in my heart he can send angels to
[1:04:31] minister to
[1:04:34] me question is can we be
[1:04:37] content with what God allows in our life
[1:04:39] and the position God puts us in or do we
[1:04:43] lust to Envy do we desire something else
[1:04:46] or somebody else's position or somebody
[1:04:48] else's
[1:04:49] family somebody else's reward or
[1:04:52] somebody else's
[1:04:54] blessing or can we just be content and
[1:04:56] thankful for what God's given us and ask
[1:04:58] God to give us strength for the place
[1:05:00] that we're
[1:05:03] at whether you're single or you're
[1:05:06] married can you be
[1:05:08] content whether you're with child or
[1:05:10] without
[1:05:11] child whether you're widowed or a
[1:05:15] widower like this is really the
[1:05:18] question this is the reality we can
[1:05:21] stand up here and preach and get excited
[1:05:23] about we have a Shepherd but you have a
[1:05:26] Shepherd who decided that you will
[1:05:27] glorify him in
[1:05:31] widowhood are you willing to glorify him
[1:05:33] in widowhood are you going to complain
[1:05:36] and fuss and feel unfairly treated
[1:05:41] and you see but brother Chad You' never
[1:05:44] been there you know what it's like
[1:05:45] that's true but I know one who does know
[1:05:48] what everyone suffers with and I know
[1:05:51] one who can send ministering angels to
[1:05:53] minister to needs and I know one who's
[1:05:55] PR promised that he'll give you peace in
[1:05:57] your heart and one that's G promised to
[1:05:58] give you strength to endure every
[1:06:04] trial I think sometimes what causes us
[1:06:07] the most mental distress and pain is the
[1:06:10] avoidance of the trial and the
[1:06:12] resistance of the trial not the actual
[1:06:16] trial I think we get ourselves worked up
[1:06:19] and and we get ourselves anxious and and
[1:06:21] and it's always because why is this
[1:06:23] happening to me this isn't fair
[1:06:25] shouldn't be my lot in life why why why
[1:06:28] why why why and and listen it's okay
[1:06:31] there's times of distress when you cry
[1:06:33] out to God I understand that I've been
[1:06:35] there I'll probably be there tomorrow I
[1:06:37] don't understand what's going to happen
[1:06:38] to me next but the reality is there's
[1:06:40] got to be some Revelation that takes us
[1:06:42] a little bit higher so we stop in the
[1:06:44] grumbling and complaining and blaming
[1:06:46] God and we get to the place where he say
[1:06:49] God has given me everything I need and
[1:06:51] if there's something that I truly need
[1:06:53] how could he not give it to me if there
[1:06:55] I need it for the journey I need it for
[1:06:57] the next step I need it to move on in
[1:06:59] this program how could he not give it to
[1:07:01] me if it was part of his mind in his
[1:07:04] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:07:05] how can it not come to me amen we
[1:07:08] realize we we we we move away from the
[1:07:10] great Revelation that's been given to us
[1:07:12] in the opening of the seals and we fall
[1:07:14] back into spiritual Amnesia and start
[1:07:16] crying why God why did you let this
[1:07:18] happen why did that happen why am I
[1:07:19] going through this and why am I having
[1:07:21] to
[1:07:23] suffer as if he didn't know it ahead of
[1:07:28] time and as if he has no
[1:07:31] provision for the
[1:07:36] trial I mean when it comes down to it
[1:07:38] this is hard
[1:07:40] preaching simple thought hard
[1:07:45] life but I think our life would get so
[1:07:48] much easier if we K quit kicking against
[1:07:51] the
[1:07:54] Pricks yes
[1:07:56] cry out to God for everything we need
[1:07:59] cry out ask God lord would you provide
[1:08:03] would you give would you help would you
[1:08:05] deliver would you save me from this
[1:08:06] trial cry out but then have faith in God
[1:08:09] with whatever he
[1:08:11] answers and trust that he's a good
[1:08:14] shepherd and he knows what he's doing
[1:08:16] and he's not
[1:08:19] failing praise be to God let's go to
[1:08:23] James chapter 4
[1:08:33] James chapter
[1:08:36] 4 and we're going to read verse
[1:08:40] one said from whence comes Wars and
[1:08:42] fightings among you come they not hence
[1:08:44] even of your own lust that you wore in
[1:08:46] your members ye lust and have not you
[1:08:49] kill and desire to have and cannot
[1:08:51] obtain you fight in war yet you have not
[1:08:53] because you ask not you ask and receive
[1:08:56] not because you ask a miss that you may
[1:08:59] consume it upon your own
[1:09:02] lusts sometimes we don't get everything
[1:09:04] we ask
[1:09:05] for question sometimes is what's the
[1:09:07] motive behind the
[1:09:09] asking what are we asking that what are
[1:09:12] we asking for that for what's the reason
[1:09:15] behind the
[1:09:17] request and the message God's provided
[1:09:19] way he says therefore brother bim's
[1:09:21] praying he says therefore we weigh our
[1:09:23] out our prayer to see if we're going to
[1:09:25] ask anything aiss to see if we should be
[1:09:28] any wrong if there would be any wrong
[1:09:31] objective to our coming here or asking
[1:09:34] or the motive we would have in asking
[1:09:35] for such a thing so we pray God that you
[1:09:38] search our
[1:09:39] hearts brother saying search me and show
[1:09:42] me the motive behind my
[1:09:44] request why do I feel like I have to
[1:09:47] have this so bad why do I need this
[1:09:51] house why do I need this job why do I
[1:09:56] need this
[1:09:58] relationship why do I need this
[1:10:00] promotion why do I need it so
[1:10:03] bad do I need it so I can take better
[1:10:06] care of my family because of the needs
[1:10:07] in my family that's a righteous request
[1:10:09] do I need it because that promotion will
[1:10:12] make me feel good about myself and I'll
[1:10:13] be over all my colleagues and I'll
[1:10:15] finally be rewarded for all my hard work
[1:10:17] and I'll look good and I'll have a
[1:10:21] title we ask and we receive not because
[1:10:23] we ask a miss that we might consume of
[1:10:25] Our Own own
[1:10:26] lust brother bam actually said it this
[1:10:28] way in 1965 the message I have heard but
[1:10:31] now I see you have to have a reason for
[1:10:34] this God don't give you those things
[1:10:36] just because you
[1:10:38] ask and you cannot ask in faith unless
[1:10:41] there's a real objective to that to be
[1:10:43] in the will of God see if you want to be
[1:10:45] well what do you want to be well for see
[1:10:49] if you want to be healed what's the
[1:10:50] reason you want to be healed what are
[1:10:52] you telling God what do you want to do
[1:10:55] with your life when you get healed
[1:10:57] there's got you've got to have a motive
[1:10:58] and an objective and they have to be
[1:11:00] right according to the will of God and
[1:11:02] then when the faith is revealed to you
[1:11:04] and God by his Sovereign Grace places
[1:11:06] that faith in there then it's
[1:11:11] over you say God I got to be healed
[1:11:13] because I got a football game Friday
[1:11:15] night and I'm the start running back and
[1:11:17] it's the playoffs
[1:11:21] and is that really the thing you need
[1:11:24] the most
[1:11:26] is that really what God's providing for
[1:11:28] you or is it Lord I need to be healed
[1:11:31] because I got a wife and I got children
[1:11:33] and I got to go back to work and I'm not
[1:11:34] going to get a paycheck and I trust you
[1:11:36] to provide anyways but if you'll heal me
[1:11:38] I'll go right back to the job you gave
[1:11:39] me to provide as a father for my
[1:11:41] children because you called me to
[1:11:43] this oh you talk about being able to
[1:11:46] have faith in your prayer because you're
[1:11:47] in your position you're where God placed
[1:11:49] you amen and it's not just so you can
[1:11:51] have something nicer it's so that you
[1:11:52] can do what God's called you to do
[1:11:57] praise God it's amazing how we go
[1:12:00] through trials we go through different
[1:12:01] things and and there's always there's
[1:12:03] always things that there's always times
[1:12:05] of lack but there's also times of
[1:12:07] abounding it's not all lack sometimes
[1:12:10] God will bring us to lack amen so that
[1:12:12] we can learn a lesson so that he can
[1:12:13] show himself a provider there's all
[1:12:15] kinds of reasons for all the things that
[1:12:17] happen to us I there's no way in the
[1:12:19] world I could sit here and declare to
[1:12:20] you the VAR the variability or the
[1:12:22] variables and why God would allow things
[1:12:24] to happen but but the reality is there's
[1:12:27] sometimes that God for no apparent
[1:12:29] reason whatsoever just pours out a
[1:12:30] blessing on you just cuz he wants
[1:12:33] to and he gives you extra funds to do
[1:12:36] something he gives you money for a
[1:12:37] vacation and money to go do something
[1:12:39] enjoyable God's not against all of that
[1:12:42] the problem is when we want it so bad
[1:12:43] and he hasn't provided and it's the only
[1:12:45] thing we can think about and we need it
[1:12:47] more than anything else that's where we
[1:12:48] start to get into
[1:12:50] trouble but when God has poured
[1:12:52] abundantly and given you the means and
[1:12:54] given you desire and it's nothing
[1:12:56] against the word you don't have to be
[1:12:57] afraid of those things you can be a
[1:12:59] happy being a child of God and having a
[1:13:01] heavenly father who loves you and will
[1:13:03] shower more on you than you even
[1:13:05] need don't be afraid of those things
[1:13:08] that's the blessings of God Amen we
[1:13:10] should never shy away from that and we
[1:13:11] should always thank God for that but the
[1:13:13] problem is when we got to have this so
[1:13:15] bad it's the only thing I can think
[1:13:17] about and I'm trying to think of another
[1:13:18] way to get it
[1:13:21] and I just I really want what God wants
[1:13:24] for me
[1:13:25] that's what I really want in my heart I
[1:13:28] I want to subject this
[1:13:31] body to what God wants for
[1:13:36] me remember when brother brandham
[1:13:39] said he come and he was talking about
[1:13:43] tension this nervous tension I've had it
[1:13:45] all my life and I wondered why he said
[1:13:48] then I began to think this tension is a
[1:13:51] blessing this tension is a blessing you
[1:13:54] know that blessing took him off the
[1:13:55] field and a nervous breakdown that
[1:13:57] blessing caused him a sour stomach to
[1:13:59] where he couldn't even eat regular food
[1:14:00] for weeks at a
[1:14:03] time but you know what he saw he saw it
[1:14:05] as a
[1:14:06] blessing he said it where would I be
[1:14:08] without this tension it's this tension
[1:14:10] that drove me to Jesus
[1:14:15] Christ brother Brandon was thanking God
[1:14:18] for his nervous condition and his
[1:14:22] tension praise God
[1:14:25] I'm going to have to go up a few grade
[1:14:29] levels sometimes I feel like I'm I'm
[1:14:32] Junior High sometimes I feel like
[1:14:34] kindergarten and today is one of those
[1:14:36] kindergarten kind of
[1:14:38] days let's look at Second
[1:14:41] Corinthians chapter
[1:14:46] 12 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:14:54] 12
[1:14:57] Paul the Apostle says in 2 Corinthians
[1:15:00] 12:7 and lest I should be exalted above
[1:15:03] measure through the abundance of the
[1:15:04] revelations there was given to me a
[1:15:06] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[1:15:08] Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[1:15:11] exalted of a measure for this thing I
[1:15:13] besought the Lord Thrice that it might
[1:15:15] depart from
[1:15:16] me I believe Paul brother Paul the
[1:15:19] Apostle Paul was in Earnest prayer I
[1:15:22] think he really wanted this thing to go
[1:15:24] away yes and he probably saw that it
[1:15:27] needed to go away to give him the
[1:15:28] freedom and Ministry that he needed I'm
[1:15:31] sure in all his prayers he was imploring
[1:15:33] God and asking God and probably had good
[1:15:36] reasons for why he needed to be free
[1:15:37] from this
[1:15:39] condition but God's answer was verse n
[1:15:43] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:15:45] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:15:47] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[1:15:49] therefore will I rather glory in my
[1:15:52] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[1:15:54] rest upon
[1:15:57] me you know what I love about the
[1:16:01] Lord when the Lord doesn't answer a
[1:16:05] prayer
[1:16:06] request he doesn't say good
[1:16:09] luck I hope it works out I can't give
[1:16:12] you that you know what he says my
[1:16:16] grace is sufficient for
[1:16:20] thee it's almost like with the no comes
[1:16:24] a me measure of Grace to carry us
[1:16:27] through the consequences of the no he
[1:16:29] never abandons us he never leaves us on
[1:16:31] he is always a good shepherd even in
[1:16:34] know even know he's a good shepherd and
[1:16:38] supplies all I need I shall not want
[1:16:42] When God says no you have to walk this
[1:16:45] path of this trial and right with it he
[1:16:47] gives me peace in my heart and Grace
[1:16:49] that's sufficient for the trial I didn't
[1:16:51] have to come up with it I didn't have to
[1:16:53] have the strength I didn't have to pull
[1:16:55] up my big boy boots and just chug
[1:16:56] through I couldn't chug through I
[1:16:58] couldn't make it amen but my shepherd
[1:17:01] has provided an extra measure of Grace
[1:17:03] for the trial that he sees fit in his
[1:17:06] Good Will to let come to pass in my
[1:17:09] life he provides There Is No
[1:17:14] Lack even in the no he sends peace in
[1:17:18] your heart ministering angels and Grace
[1:17:21] that is sufficient for
[1:17:23] us what a beautiful Shepherd we have
[1:17:26] what a beautiful savior you know what I
[1:17:28] think one of the biggest problems in my
[1:17:29] life is when God gives me Grace to
[1:17:31] endure the trial and I don't want the
[1:17:33] grace I want what I
[1:17:40] wanted God help
[1:17:42] me when God has given a peace in my
[1:17:45] heart and and an ability to carry
[1:17:47] through with the trial but I don't want
[1:17:49] that because I don't want this trial and
[1:17:51] I don't want to suffer and I don't want
[1:17:52] to wait and I don't want any of this and
[1:17:54] he supplied a Grace that'll carry me
[1:17:56] right through a peace in my heart
[1:17:57] that'll Carry Me Through then the
[1:17:59] problem is there's a lust in my flesh
[1:18:00] that I don't want to go this way and I
[1:18:02] don't want to submit to the will of the
[1:18:03] Lord and I still want what I want and
[1:18:05] then what am I doing what am I doing
[1:18:07] with this precious Grace he didn't have
[1:18:09] to give that you understand he didn't
[1:18:11] have to provide he didn't have to put
[1:18:13] peace in the heart he didn't have to
[1:18:14] give Supernatural strength he didn't
[1:18:16] have to do that and how dare me reject
[1:18:19] the gift of Grace because I still wanted
[1:18:21] to have it my way amen
[1:18:29] he's going to have a
[1:18:32] bride he's going to have a
[1:18:34] bride and she's going to say I'm a
[1:18:37] little
[1:18:38] scared I don't really want this this is
[1:18:40] this is hard on my flesh but I know
[1:18:44] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:18:45] shadow of death I shall not fear because
[1:18:48] thou art with me I'm not alone even in
[1:18:51] my trial there's a Shepherd here and I
[1:18:54] shall not want amen even in the shallow
[1:18:58] shadow of death even in the midst of a
[1:19:00] trial I will have no lack because I have
[1:19:03] a great
[1:19:06] Shepherd
[1:19:08] amen praise
[1:19:10] God brother bam
[1:19:13] says in the message is your life worthy
[1:19:16] of the
[1:19:17] Gospel he's talking about his daughter
[1:19:19] Sharon rose dying right before his
[1:19:23] eyes he said said the hardest trial of
[1:19:26] my
[1:19:27] life was when he prayed to God for her
[1:19:30] healing and it was like the sky was
[1:19:32] brass it was like God pulled down a
[1:19:33] black sheet and wouldn't hear his
[1:19:36] prayer God was
[1:19:38] refusing to answer his
[1:19:43] prayer this is what he says he said then
[1:19:45] I
[1:19:46] thought what who am I
[1:19:51] anyhow who am I to question his majest
[1:19:55] y he's talking about the death of his
[1:19:57] baby girl 18month old the one who would

[1:21:17] there you
[1:21:18] are you know what I think he had I think

[1:21:26] trial did it take him to the edge of
[1:21:29] himself yeah it took him Beyond
[1:21:31] himself it took him Beyond his strength
[1:21:34] Beyond his ability to cope beyond beyond
[1:21:37] grief he went beyond grief and he wept
[1:21:40] and he and he tried to commit suicide
[1:21:42] but when he tried to commit suicide who
[1:21:43] kept him
[1:21:44] alive when he tried to pull the trigger
[1:21:47] who froze the trigger yes sir the one
[1:21:50] who allowed the trial was the one who
[1:21:52] was so close he wouldn't let the trigger
[1:21:54] pull
[1:21:55] where was the shepherd He was there all
[1:21:58] along when he took his glove off and
[1:22:01] tried to touch the high voltage wire to
[1:22:03] kill himself amen who was standing right
[1:22:05] there who was up on the pole who grabbed
[1:22:08] him and pulled him off and laid him down
[1:22:10] in the grass cuz brother Bram said the
[1:22:11] next thing I know I was sitting on the
[1:22:13] ground and I don't know how I got there
[1:22:15] who was that that was a Shepherd I have
[1:22:17] a shepherd I shall not
[1:22:19] want when in the worst time of his life
[1:22:22] when he couldn't go on when it was
[1:22:23] beyond grief when it was beyond a man's
[1:22:26] ability to grief he had lost a wife he
[1:22:28] had lost a baby girl amen but I say his
[1:22:31] grace is
[1:22:32] sufficient I say he sends ministering
[1:22:35] angels I say he's a Good Shepherd in the
[1:22:38] midst of the worst day of our life I
[1:22:40] shall not want there was never a lack in
[1:22:42] the prophet's life he never went without
[1:22:45] for one
[1:22:46] minute did he grieve yes was he
[1:22:49] heartbroken yes did he cry yes did he
[1:22:52] pray did he want to give it all in did
[1:22:54] he want to commit suicide all of those
[1:22:56] things are yes but through the midst of
[1:22:58] it all there was a Shepherd providing
[1:23:00] every need he had when it got too far
[1:23:03] when he couldn't go anymore and he tried
[1:23:05] to kill himself he stopped it when he
[1:23:07] tried again he stopped it when he got to
[1:23:09] the place where he was breaking down
[1:23:11] inside and there was absolutely nowhere
[1:23:13] else to go you know what he did he let
[1:23:15] him see his wife and his baby in heaven
[1:23:17] in a
[1:23:19] dream tell me we don't have a good
[1:23:21] shepherd tell me that was bad that was
[1:23:24] wrong there was something wrong with
[1:23:25] that trial there was nothing wrong with
[1:23:27] that trial he was in control all
[1:23:35] along when he was breaking up
[1:23:38] inside in a dream he was walking down
[1:23:42] the street whistling a
[1:23:44] tune will the Wagon Wheel be
[1:23:48] broken he comes to a little gate and at
[1:23:51] the little gate there's a beautiful
[1:23:52] young woman standing there
[1:23:57] she says
[1:23:59] Daddy he had no idea who that was he
[1:24:02] said what daddy why you calling me dad
[1:24:05] they were almost the same age you
[1:24:06] realize this he was a young man in his
[1:24:08] early 20s and she was about 18 19 years
[1:24:13] old and she goes in Earth I was your
[1:24:15] little Sharon
[1:24:17] Rose what's God doing he's supplying his
[1:24:23] need he's comforting he's giving Grace
[1:24:26] he's being a good
[1:24:29] shepherd we think a good shepherd won't
[1:24:31] let that happen no that's not a good
[1:24:34] shepherd cuz sometimes the Good Shepherd
[1:24:36] needs to knows you've got to walk
[1:24:37] through the valley of Shadow to death to
[1:24:39] get to greener
[1:24:41] pastures sometimes you got to transition
[1:24:44] you got to move from here to there and
[1:24:45] it's going to be scary to move from here
[1:24:47] to there but once you get there there's
[1:24:49] going to be more nutrition and better
[1:24:51] grass for a better life and you're going
[1:24:53] to grow better but you got to go through
[1:24:55] this Valley of the shadow of
[1:24:58] death but in the Valley of the shadow of
[1:25:00] death he never left us
[1:25:05] alone remember the poem of
[1:25:09] footprints person walking along the sand
[1:25:12] and walking with the Lord and they
[1:25:14] noticed two sets of footprints and they
[1:25:16] look back and there was a period of time
[1:25:18] that there was only one set of
[1:25:19] footprints not two and the person who
[1:25:22] asked the Lord they they said Lord what
[1:25:25] that was the hardest time of my life why
[1:25:27] did you leave me
[1:25:31] alone this is our perspective as dumb
[1:25:38] sheep why did you leave me alone and the
[1:25:41] Lord said I never left you alone that's
[1:25:43] where I carried you that's why you see
[1:25:45] one set of
[1:25:48] footprints he's a good shepherd and
[1:25:51] because he's a good shepherd I shall not
[1:25:55] want and heartbreak and
[1:25:59] despair he's still
[1:26:03] providing job said though you slay me
[1:26:07] yet will I trust
[1:26:09] him can we get to the place where we can
[1:26:11] say the same thing though he slay me yet
[1:26:14] will I trust him we're going to have to
[1:26:17] cuz brother remember said this bride
[1:26:19] will come face to face with the same
[1:26:21] Temptation like in the
[1:26:22] garden what is that going to be brother
[1:26:24] Chad believing in some strange Doctrine
[1:26:27] in the message and and maybe that
[1:26:29] Temptation will be giving up
[1:26:33] ourselves and dying
[1:26:36] completely to the word maybe to be
[1:26:39] closer than we think maybe it'll not be
[1:26:42] some fancy Doctrine and some
[1:26:45] some maybe it'll be
[1:26:48] self-preservation maybe it'll be a lust
[1:26:50] a want for something more than what God
[1:26:52] the boundaries that God's put us in
[1:26:54] that's right maybe it's good if we learn
[1:26:57] to trust the shepherd
[1:27:00] now brother B goes on to saying Christ
[1:27:02] is revealed in his own word from 65 this
[1:27:05] is an amazing
[1:27:07] statement says I've been this week down
[1:27:09] in a country staying with some dear
[1:27:11] friends I asked some of them at the
[1:27:13] table yesterday when we was eating we
[1:27:15] always sat around just like a little
[1:27:17] study on the Bible we was talking about
[1:27:19] love and there was a certain person said
[1:27:21] to me he said I believe you're an
[1:27:23] antichrist
[1:27:26] if somebody said that to me I'd be like
[1:27:28] you're crazy you don't know I've done
[1:27:29] this and I believe this and I'd start
[1:27:31] defending
[1:27:34] myself don't look at me like that cuz
[1:27:36] you would
[1:27:39] too in your mind even say you start
[1:27:41] proving why you're not
[1:27:44] Antichrist listen what brother R said if
[1:27:48] that would be pleasing to my Lord that's
[1:27:50] what I want to
[1:27:53] be
[1:27:54] and we think we've reached
[1:28:00] maurity if that would be pleasing to my
[1:28:03] Lord that's what I want to be I want to
[1:28:06] be whatever he wants me to be I love
[1:28:11] him you know what I want to be whatever
[1:28:14] he wants me to be that's what I want I
[1:28:17] don't want hardship I don't I don't want
[1:28:20] trials I don't want despair I don't want
[1:28:24] any of these hard things that we thought
[1:28:26] I don't want any of them I don't want
[1:28:28] lack I don't want need I don't want to
[1:28:29] be like the Apostle Paul abounding and
[1:28:31] abasing I just want to
[1:28:33] bound I don't ever pray for a
[1:28:36] basing but what I really want there's
[1:28:39] something deeper inside than self
[1:28:41] there's something way down on inside
[1:28:42] says really what I want is I want to
[1:28:44] please him I don't know how sometimes I
[1:28:47] don't have the ability in myself I fail
[1:28:49] miserably but what I want is to serve
[1:28:51] him and I know if I could just learn to
[1:28:53] trust him that his grace will be
[1:28:55] sufficient for me I know that if I can
[1:28:58] just stop trying to save myself and just
[1:29:01] submit myself to him that he's a good
[1:29:03] shepherd and in the Valley of the shadow
[1:29:04] of death if he leads me there he'll be
[1:29:06] with me there if I get down on My
[1:29:08] Darkest Day he'll be just as close to me
[1:29:10] as he was to the prophet amen some 60 70
[1:29:13] years ago he hasn't gone anywhere he's
[1:29:15] the same loving Shepherd and we're just
[1:29:18] his
[1:29:23] sheep
[1:29:25] you know he told
[1:29:27] Peter told Peter you're going to be
[1:29:30] crucified and Peter said
[1:29:33] okay so where's that at just you have to
[1:29:36] read the Bible and find it
[1:29:37] yourself Peter says in the in one of the
[1:29:40] books of Peter he says the Lord show me
[1:29:42] the time and my departure is at
[1:29:44] hand and he wasn't whining or
[1:29:47] complaining or begging for more
[1:29:49] time God had already given him his will
[1:29:53] and he had accepted it
[1:29:55] remember when the Apostle Paul it was
[1:29:57] time for his great trial to be
[1:29:59] imprisoned at Jerusalem and and held
[1:30:01] captive he was going to end up being
[1:30:02] held for years before he finally went to
[1:30:05] trial then when he finally got to trial
[1:30:06] they were going to kill
[1:30:08] him and a prisoner for years and as he
[1:30:10] was moving into that along every every
[1:30:13] city he went and every place that he
[1:30:15] went there were prophets rising up
[1:30:16] prophesying that when you get to
[1:30:18] Jerusalem you'll be bound and you'll be
[1:30:20] in prison and then the Prophet come
[1:30:22] along one day and he he was in a place
[1:30:24] and he come and he took his girdle and
[1:30:25] he bound his own hands and said this
[1:30:27] will happen to the man who owns this
[1:30:28] girdle and they all started weeping and
[1:30:30] they all started trying to convince the
[1:30:33] Apostle Paul not to go to Jerusalem and
[1:30:35] Paul says what mean you Breaking My
[1:30:37] Heart by this weeping he said I am ready
[1:30:40] to be in prison and even to die for
[1:30:42] Jesus
[1:30:43] Christ he knew what was happening and he
[1:30:46] went anyways it was prophesy and all the
[1:30:49] prophecies were true and mean he say why
[1:30:51] would God raise up prophets to tell him
[1:30:53] that wasn't that a warning didn't Paul
[1:30:55] make a mistake Paul didn't make any
[1:30:57] mistake he went exactly where God was
[1:30:59] leading him his Shepherd let him right
[1:31:00] to Jerusalem and all the prophets they
[1:31:02] were prophesying by the anointing of the
[1:31:04] spirit that you're going to be in prison
[1:31:06] when you get there but he says None of
[1:31:07] these things move me amen because God
[1:31:10] already showed him his will amen this
[1:31:11] was just another test in this city and
[1:31:14] another test in this city and another
[1:31:16] test in this
[1:31:20] city Paul had finally got to the place
[1:31:23] where all he wanted to do was God's
[1:31:26] will what God wanted him to do is what
[1:31:29] he wanted to do that's where Peter wound
[1:31:30] up at the end of his journey that's
[1:31:32] where Paul wound up at the end of his
[1:31:33] journey and that is where this bride is
[1:31:35] going to wind up in the end of her
[1:31:37] journey to where she only wants to do
[1:31:39] what the Lord does and God will supply
[1:31:42] the
[1:31:43] grace needed to do it it's not going to
[1:31:47] be our strength friends don't don't get
[1:31:49] a bit nervous and say how am I going to
[1:31:52] do that you're not going to do it it
[1:31:54] he's going to do it in
[1:31:56] you you know what you're going to do
[1:31:59] tell this flesh to be
[1:32:01] quiet and sit
[1:32:04] still we're going to obey the
[1:32:07] word where's your struggle your struggle
[1:32:10] is going to be
[1:32:13] Gethsemane everything else he supplies
[1:32:16] his strength for Gethsemane is where you
[1:32:18] wrestle your will and submit it to his
[1:32:22] will I say God help us to
[1:32:27] surrender let's read Psalms 37 together
[1:32:30] as we
[1:32:40] close Psalms
[1:32:52] 37 in verse four
[1:32:58] Delight thyself also in the Lord and He
[1:33:01] Shall give Thee the desires of thy
[1:33:04] heart commit thy way unto the Lord trust
[1:33:07] also in him and he shall bring it to
[1:33:11] pass I used to read the scripture
[1:33:13] differently than I read it
[1:33:15] now could I explain to you how I see it
[1:33:18] now Delight thyself also in the
[1:33:21] Lord and He Shall give thee the desire
[1:33:24] of their
[1:33:25] heart what would the desire of your
[1:33:27] heart be if you delighted yourself in
[1:33:29] the
[1:33:31] Lord a new job and a better car
[1:33:34] and no if you delighted yourself in the
[1:33:37] Lord the desire of your heart would be
[1:33:38] the Lord and everything that pertains to
[1:33:41] him and everything he
[1:33:43] wants I used to think well if I say good
[1:33:46] things about God I can get anything I
[1:33:48] want go to church
[1:33:50] and it's not it's not the way this works
[1:33:54] Delight thyself in the Lord and He Shall
[1:33:57] give you the desires of your
[1:34:01] heart keep reading
[1:34:03] here Delight thyself also in the Lord
[1:34:06] and He Shall give Thee the desires of
[1:34:07] the heart commit thy way unto the Lord
[1:34:11] there you go commit your way whatever
[1:34:14] way you want me to go I've committed it
[1:34:15] to you Lord commit your way to the Lord
[1:34:18] trust also in him and he shall bring it
[1:34:21] to pass how could he not bring it to
[1:34:23] pass
[1:34:24] because I've trusted in him and I've
[1:34:25] committed my way to him it's a guarantee
[1:34:29] what am I doing I have to turn my heart
[1:34:31] to him and he's got to become the
[1:34:33] Delight of my heart and then I'll have
[1:34:34] whatever my heart wants amen and if I
[1:34:37] commit my way and trust in him then
[1:34:38] he'll bring it to pass absolutely it
[1:34:41] can't fail because I've turned my heart
[1:34:43] completely to him and committed my way
[1:34:45] completely to him and I've trusted
[1:34:46] completely in him and it will all work
[1:34:49] outall praise God this is another cuty
[1:34:53] sign that you can put on the wall
[1:34:54] somewhere and totally
[1:34:59] misunderstand but I thank God that he's
[1:35:02] given us a
[1:35:04] reality of his word not the cliche
[1:35:08] Christianity the surface level but he's
[1:35:10] taken the seal off of that and brought
[1:35:12] us down to the depths of
[1:35:14] reality where there's a gospel that
[1:35:16] works every day there is a word that
[1:35:20] works every day of your life your best
[1:35:22] day at works your worst day at
[1:35:25] works on Brothers brenham's best day
[1:35:27] when he was standing amen with thousands
[1:35:30] in an auditorium and he's calling out
[1:35:32] diseases and calling out sicknesses and
[1:35:34] winning a tremendous victory for the
[1:35:35] Lord amen that day God was there with
[1:35:38] him the day he was trying to shoot his
[1:35:40] shoot himself in the head God was there
[1:35:42] with him the day he tried to electrocute
[1:35:45] himself on a pole God was there with him
[1:35:47] amen when did he not have a Shepherd
[1:35:49] when he was high when he was low when
[1:35:51] every stage in between he had a great
[1:35:53] Shepherd the chief Shepherd was with him
[1:35:55] and he didn't want for nothing because
[1:35:57] everything he needed was supplied when
[1:36:00] he needed
[1:36:02] it everything we need is going to be
[1:36:05] supplied when we need it why because I
[1:36:08] have a real Shepherd and I am his sheep
[1:36:10] and I don't have to provide for myself I
[1:36:12] only have to do one thing is follow the
[1:36:15] shepherd and everything's going to work
[1:36:17] out but that Shepherd is leading you
[1:36:19] into the valley of shadow of death it's
[1:36:21] going to be okay he'll be with me
[1:36:25] how can a Good Shepherd lead in such a
[1:36:27] bad way how can a good General lead him
[1:36:31] amen out of Egypt right up against the
[1:36:33] wall and right up against the Red
[1:36:36] Sea I tell you why cuz he was a good
[1:36:42] shepherd God will lead us right up
[1:36:44] against the wall and against the Red Sea
[1:36:46] and why will he do it because he's a
[1:36:47] good
[1:36:49] shepherd you know there's times that
[1:36:51] we'll ask him for something and he'll
[1:36:52] say no
[1:36:54] and you know why he'll say no cuz he's a
[1:36:56] good
[1:37:00] shepherd I'm I'm not very old
[1:37:04] yet turned 47 this
[1:37:07] year but I look back on my life if God
[1:37:10] had given me everything I desired I
[1:37:12] would have destroyed
[1:37:16] myself and if you had given your
[1:37:18] children everything they desired they
[1:37:20] would have destroyed themselves yeah I'm
[1:37:23] glad I have a Shepherd who sometimes
[1:37:25] says yes and sometimes says
[1:37:30] no sometimes who even smacked me with
[1:37:32] his
[1:37:33] rod and it makes me love him
[1:37:37] more let's go to first Thessalonians 5
[1:37:40] this is the last scripture we'll read
[1:37:51] together 1 Thessalonians
[1:38:04] five verse
[1:38:07] 16 says Rejoice ever more can you
[1:38:12] rejoice
[1:38:14] always Rejoice ever more pray without
[1:38:18] ceasing in everything give
[1:38:22] thanks now this is going to be an
[1:38:25] exercise to see if we can actually do
[1:38:28] this in everything you say
[1:38:33] everything does that include bad
[1:38:37] things we got it in everything give
[1:38:40] thanks for this is the will of God in
[1:38:43] Christ Jesus concerning
[1:38:45] you rejoice ever more pray without
[1:38:50] ceasing in everything give thanks man
[1:38:55] God bless you let's Stand
[1:39:03] Together
[1:39:08] amen you know musicians if you'd come
[1:39:11] brother John if youd come when I was
[1:39:14] away I preached the message in Perth and
[1:39:17] uh if God ever inspires me to I'll
[1:39:19] preach it here
[1:39:20] but I started looking at the subject
[1:39:23] that everybody wants to be a bride
[1:39:24] nobody wants to be a
[1:39:27] wife everybody wants to have their day
[1:39:29] of Glory everybody wants to be the one
[1:39:31] who's accepted everybody wants to be the
[1:39:33] one whose name is on the invitation who
[1:39:35] buys the dress who picks out the flowers
[1:39:37] who picks out the songs who comes to the
[1:39:39] wedding who's the chosen of one man his
[1:39:42] own choice it's a wonderful place to
[1:39:45] be you play a honeymoon you go on a
[1:39:48] honeymoon and it's wonderful to be a
[1:39:50] bride but when you come back from the
[1:39:52] honeymoon and you come to church on
[1:39:54] Sunday and you go home Sunday night and
[1:39:56] you go to bed and you wake up Monday
[1:39:57] morning when his alarm goes off at 5:30
[1:40:00] you've got to get up to get the coffee
[1:40:02] and get the bagel
[1:40:04] and and then you got to pack his tuna
[1:40:07] fish sandwich and put it in his lunch
[1:40:08] box and send him down the
[1:40:11] road everybody wants to be the bride but
[1:40:13] who wants to be a wife who wants to wash
[1:40:16] the socks and who wants to do the who
[1:40:18] wants to vacuum the cloes who wants to
[1:40:20] give their body to raise the babies who
[1:40:21] wants to get up in the middle of the ton
[1:40:24] night everybody wants to be a bride but
[1:40:27] who wants to be a wife you know when you
[1:40:30] take your wedding vows when you take
[1:40:32] your vows you say for
[1:40:36] better and For
[1:40:38] Worse you know the day you take your vow
[1:40:41] you never imagine a worse there's no
[1:40:43] such a
[1:40:44] thing for better for worse for
[1:40:49] richer and for
[1:40:52] poor in
[1:40:54] health and in
[1:40:56] sickness you know what you've done you
[1:40:59] signed up to go through the
[1:41:01] valley with this man or this
[1:41:05] woman you know God is here Christ is
[1:41:08] here as a bridegroom you know what he's
[1:41:10] doing he's marrying you and
[1:41:13] I everybody wants to be a bride but who
[1:41:16] wants to be a wife who's willing to take
[1:41:19] Jesus Christ for better and For Worse
[1:41:24] for richer and for poor Paul knew how to
[1:41:28] do it brother brandham did as well Peter
[1:41:30] did can we can we make a commitment we
[1:41:34] can take our vow for sickness and in
[1:41:38] health oh when we first came to Christ
[1:41:40] it was all going to be health and it was
[1:41:41] all going to be good and it was all
[1:41:43] going to
[1:41:44] be but then we realize I must make my
[1:41:47] commitment to him in sickness and in
[1:41:49] health richer and poor for better and
[1:41:53] For
[1:41:55] Worse praise God but you know what he's
[1:42:01] faithful I don't just want to be the
[1:42:04] bride but I want to move in this
[1:42:05] transition phase to be the wife of the
[1:42:08] Lamb cuz you know Book of Revelation
[1:42:10] says the Lamb's wife that means the lamb

[1:50:01] you know so many times the devil wants

[1:50:06] focus on what really
[1:50:08] matters we look at we get passed over in
[1:50:11] the workplace and we feel like we've
[1:50:14] been cheated and they work then we say
[1:50:16] they pulled politics and and they got
[1:50:19] the promotion and really I've got the
[1:50:21] most experience I no listen listen it's
[1:50:23] not politics it's the will of God for
[1:50:26] your
[1:50:27] life we got to stop thinking
[1:50:30] carnally did they use politics sure they
[1:50:32] Ed politics was it Dirty Deeds sure it
[1:50:34] was Dirty Deeds but if God predestinated
[1:50:36] you have that job how could the politics
[1:50:38] outdo God's
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:41] will sometimes we feel left behind in
[1:50:43] life we feel like they got to finish
[1:50:46] college I didn't get to finish college
[1:50:47] nobody had helped me pay for it I had to
[1:50:49] go to the work
[1:50:50] first if you would have went to col you
[1:50:52] have probably wound up an unbeliever so
[1:50:54] God saved
[1:50:57] you I mean nothing's out of kilter
[1:51:00] friend you say you know they feel sorry
[1:51:03] for themselves because everybody else my
[1:51:05] age got to retire some retired early and
[1:51:07] look they're enjoying the retirement but
[1:51:09] I still have to work listen God knows
[1:51:11] that you can't handle
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:16] retirement what whatever reason we just
[1:51:18] should say thank you God you know what I
[1:51:21] need you know what best you know exactly
[1:51:24] you made me and you got a plan for me
[1:51:26] and you know what I need I think I need
[1:51:28] to retire I think I need a new car I
[1:51:31] think I need a promotion I think I
[1:51:33] deserve this I think I need this degree
[1:51:35] but actually God you're the one who
[1:51:37] actually knows what I
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:40] need because with you I shall not
[1:51:45] want you're not going to miss out friend
[1:51:47] you're not missing out on
[1:51:49] anything that's carnal and we all strug
[1:51:52] with it every one of us don't don't
[1:51:54] don't think that you're the only one
[1:51:56] you're one of everybody else that's in
[1:51:57] the room that struggles with the same
[1:51:59] thing everybody else got married and I'm
[1:52:02] still not married it's not fair How can
[1:52:04] there be not fair with God tell me how
[1:52:07] that's
[1:52:08] possible everybody else gets to have a
[1:52:10] family but I don't get to have a family
[1:52:12] amen it's not right how is there
[1:52:14] anything out of kilter with God how can
[1:52:17] he fail how can he not be a good
[1:52:20] shepherd how can he forget about us how
[1:52:22] can his plan for us be disrupted how can
[1:52:25] the things that he's predestinated not
[1:52:27] come to pass amen
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:31] right the devil wants us to look around
[1:52:33] and become
[1:52:34] dissatisfied and begin to want for
[1:52:37] things that are outside the boundaries
[1:52:39] of what God's allowed for our
[1:52:41] life at some point we need to turn our
[1:52:44] vision heavenward and say I have a
[1:52:47] heavenly father who watches over me I've
[1:52:50] got a god who's my daddy and he knows
[1:52:52] what I need and he'll give me everything
[1:52:54] according to his riches and
[1:52:57] Glory I have a husband a bridegroom I I
[1:53:01] I have a provider I have a
[1:53:03] Shepherd I've got everything I need and
[1:53:06] if I need something else he'll provide
[1:53:08] that
[1:53:10] too I'll ask him and believe that he'll
[1:53:12] give it to me and if I ask believing
[1:53:14] I'll have it and if he says no I'll
[1:53:16] still believe it's right and it either
[1:53:19] come later or I don't need it but I'm
[1:53:21] not going to quit trusting in
[1:53:23] him let's take our eyes off of these
[1:53:26] carnal things and let's keep our eyes
[1:53:28] focused on our

[1:53:58] I was laying in a in a a CT scan with my
[1:54:00] arms up over my head and they slid the
[1:54:02] tray back and I remember just saying God
[1:54:04] whatever path you want me to walk I'll
[1:54:08] walk I didn't know what he wanted but he
[1:54:11] supernaturally came on the scene and
[1:54:13] made sure I didn't need a surgery and
[1:54:14] delivered me from that and I started
[1:54:17] thinking when was that and I started
[1:54:19] doing some math and it was almost 20
[1:54:21] years ago

[1:54:24] impossible that was almost 20 years ago
[1:54:28] where does another 20 years put me and
[1:54:30] 20 years after that it was like that who
[1:54:34] cares about the car and the house and
[1:54:37] the relationship and the promotion and
[1:54:40] the
[1:54:41] [Music]

[1:55:05] it but now I'm saying it by Revelation I
[1:55:08] shall not want Chad Lamb is not going to

[1:55:14] going to supply all my needs according
[1:55:15] to his riches and Glory I'm not worried
