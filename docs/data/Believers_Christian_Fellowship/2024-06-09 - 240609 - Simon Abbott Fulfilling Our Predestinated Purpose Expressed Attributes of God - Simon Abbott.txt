God bless you thank you thank you hey God bless you Blake kind of coughs and blows his nose and quickly flicks the mic on without knowing anyone noticing I ain't that clever Lord's good and I'm thankful the Lord the Lord uses each and every one each and every gift and brother brother Blake you know I appreciate the song leaders I always appreciate the song I used to play the piano myself so you were always the first one out playing before church and you know when folks going into church and everyone's stressed out and busy with the things of the world that we're trying to leave behind but you're still thinking thoughts and the musicians are the first ones that have got to go into battle and it's a responsibility and it's something that um not everyone's aware there of until you've been in that position so we appreciate them but brother Blake there he was uh he was I think he was listening like yesterday brother brother uh John we went to Hans yesterday it's probably not the best idea when you've got to stand here the next day but on the on the way home I just had that song in my heart you know that deep yet I pray and higher every day and brother Blake sung that today and the songs are in line with all the Lord given us so we are thankful for that so we give greetings from back home the small group that we are and I just pray that the Lord blesses them watches over them this is the furthest we've ever come without the kids and uh don't really like it to be honest with you they're not they're not children anymore but they still are if you know what I mean and uh I know we're all children of the Lord but all is well so anyway all is well anyway and I'm sure brother Chad's doing just fine cuz he said I shouldn't say this but he sent me a picture of his little Crumpet this morning I bought him some little unhealthy snack from England you know so all is well the Lord's good so um if we can please just Begin by turn to Ephesians 1 if we can 3-1 Ephesians 1 we're going to read 3-1 Ephesians 1 verse 3-11 The Lord's Good Sister this is zill here isn't it from Germany Z here it's nice that um someone for our well it's not really nice we're all from the same country you know the English shouldn't really say this but the English kind of don't like the old Germans but I've just got a love in my heart for them I love them to bit when I say the English you know the worldly English and I'm sure the Germans feel the same kind of way but we just love each other and I just I just love I love my I love going brother Andreas up there in Germany we just love each I just love him and I love the Saints there so it's nice that we're uh on foreign soil together but we're supposed to be uh like going into Canaan we're supposed to be like you know possessing the land as we go so all is well right try to calm down and I'm just talking nonsense by the way the more you get to know me there's more of that unfortunately all is well let's read verse 3 to 11 if we can amen blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise and GL uh to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen let's just pray over the reading of the word Lord Jesus help us Lord we pray Lord Jesus let it just speak your word Lord nothing else but your word help us Lord we pray we just love you Lord show us something Lord of yourself show us ourselves Lord just clean the mirror a little bit this morning so we can see ourselves clearer lord it's our desire speak to us we pray we love you Lord and we bless your name amen amen so you may be seated so our thought this morning is uh fulfilling our predestinated purpose and um as a subtitle expressed attributes of God so fulfilling our predestinated purpose and we are and we are obviously we are expressed attributes of God so I'd like to look at predestination this morning and the revealing of our predestinated purpose because we do have a predestinated purpose now predestination is one of the it it's probably one of the most uh controversial subjects if you would speak to uh nominal Christians because predestination means you are or you aren't and people kind of don't like that now we're here today cuz we are so we can talk about it without it being cont you know what I mean but if you if you talk to your neighbor about predestination they kind of yeah they don't like it the predestination goes deep deeper than what we think and we know that it's something that we're all looking at all the time and it kind of it shows us where we're from it shows us our identity and predestination you know if we have eternal life then we are of God there is only one eternal life and so in order to see clearer we have to go back to when we first were predestinated and uh that was as we read in the scriptures before the foundation of the world I'd like to read a quote here his brother bam means great greater than Solomon he's here brother says it's in 62 in the beginning before there was anything it was God before a meteor before there was light before there was an atom before there was a molecule he was God but he couldn't he was the great controlling power of everything and he was everything in him now now in him was attributes you know what attribute mean raise up your hand anyone who knows attribute sure you you know what attribute is something that's in you it's got to display itself like an attribute like you love scenery and when you see the scenery something oh it just my it Thrills your soul now in God he wasn't God yet because God is an object of worship there was nothing for to worship him he was God but he wasn't God in that manner now he must he must have created angels then they begin to worship him next he had an attribute to be a father next he had Anri rute to be a son next thing he had an attribute to be a Healer next thing an attribute to be a savior see and all these things had to display themselves see and God to make man sin so he could punish him no and he put him on the basis of free moral agency and a man sinned himself so therefore God became a savior see it's only the attributes of God displaying themselves that we see okay so these are all obviously things that we know it's not it's nothing new but you know we see that before the foundation of the world that when God dwelt Alone with God he wasn't God now that's quite a statement to make but it's pretty clear when he explains it if if there's nothing to worship you then you can't be God although as he very rightly says in the beginning he was God although not yet manifested in that particular attribute of himself okay so when the angel were then created as brother says now suddenly he can be worshiped and the attribute of God now suddenly was manifested okay so this is quite important for us to understand and I'm going to say this a few times today because at that point God was God but the attribute of him right in the beginning when you read John 1 in the beginning was the word okay so that's the very beginning of time there is no time the very beginning of the beginning um yeah it's hard to get your head around but anyway um he he was God but that attribute of God hadn't manifested yet now when the Angels were created now suddenly he was worshiped and suddenly he could fulfill the attribute of being God okay so when the Lord dwelt alone with his thoughts and look at the end of the day brother R we use these Expressions when God dwelt Alone with his his thoughts if I dwell alone with my thoughts they jumbled up see when the Lord's dwelling alone it's an expression that we kind of use to get our peab brain like tiny little PE brain mind around kind of the concept of what we're talking about so we say God dwelt Alone with his thoughts and when he dwelt alone with his thoughts then to use that expression all of his attributes were in him so when we read John 1 in the beginning you can just like in the beginning just pause there everything that God was ever will be ever is now was in there right so everything absolutely everything we with no brother brother um Franco pardon me the um there was no uh with no exception it was all in there so I'm going to try to draw it here got sister last time sister Oh Sister Joyce bless her heart she'll be she'll be at home streaming but last time I think I drew sister Joyce yeah is she oh she's there that's sweet so sister Joyce I think I drew her in there so I'm just going to start here by uh my little I love drawing timelines and stuff so so this is now this is now way way back back back in uh I can't write time the beginning be beginning I can't spell very well that's one of my I'm so sorry I've usually I shouldn't say this I've usually got sister marrying and I write I'm a board and I look back cuz she's quite clever you know I kind of look back and I'm she looks at me she's like I'm like and so I guess she'll be streaming in now and brother Michael will be chuckling I'm sure but back in the beginning I think we can move this one can't we here that's it so back in the beginning and I think last time I was here I think I actually Drew this infolding this which I I love this kind of in I'm going to make it bigger this time and last time there was three I think but I'm going to draw it bigger like that because when God be and when God was back with his thoughts and all his attributes look he we can't get our head around it but he everything was he you can't even say he saw everything but in him everything was am so even me standing here today with this God bless you with this pen you know with this pen and we got sister Lan with the blue jumper on that was in him it was it was present tense back there although not yet manifested okay so now in here we we've got um um in here we've got brother says I'm I'm going to put the cloud which is going to be like this uh this one's the cloud and this one's the pillar of fire and then we've got here healer healer savior Savior and name me something else brother Brian another attribute of God huh deliver deliverer that's a good one yeah deliverer deliverer you could have given me some easy to spell so everything's in there everything is in there so now even and attribute of being a son okay so this is the important one now and I always put a little Pillar of Fire above that's the Sun so now remember so all these attributes absolutely everything was there and so if we now kind of zoom in on this on this picture although not yet manifested okay was God in Bride form amen now we always and we always look at the attributes of God as being the Savior being the son as being the Healer and all these things which is absolutely right we always kind of we never kind of mentioned that actually bride form was in there too and so I'm going to put a uh a circle around with a little arrow in infolding okay because now they are one the bride was not yet manifested yet okay so because she's still an attribute of God I've put that circle around which shows now that she is actually although she's a part of him she's in him amen so the arrow is showing that she's in him okay so she's in him she's not yet separated amen and uh we can see this is the attribute part so in now back in the beginning this is everything that God was okay and in him is this attribute so now if we read now let's just go back and read Ephesians verse three again what Ephesians verse three we've just read this it says now you will notice as we read this everything is written I want you to notice in past tense which is the whole predestinated thing so read it it says here blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha past tense blessed blessed past tense blessed us with all spiritual blessings in present tense Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and as we read through um what we've read this morning you will see that things are in in past tense it's done so if we notice that everything that we are is in Christ Jesus so notice here it says in verse three has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places notice in Christ Jesus so it's hard to get your head around right but let's just say I'm going to use John Brooks did I say that look James was an attribute of you right although not yet manifested when you were like 15 16 right in you although not yet manifested right and you couldn't see him but he was there now when we would go back further than we would see the manifestation of James but actually and we don't know what lays inside James until it manifests himself see if the Lord comes tomorrow then James is that's it that's it but if the Lord carries 10 years you know now suddenly we'll see what was inside James as it were so although it's in there until it becomes manifested so the point I'm trying to say is that although you can't see it it don't mean it's not there right when was the lamb slay before the foundation but actually 2,000 years ago but actually before the foundation of the world see if you would go back here where there is no time even though not yet manifested it is see what I mean okay so so she's in him but she's not yet separated so basically now and you know we want to see you know we want to see how position we want to see who we are we want to see we want to we want to have comfort to know that he's in control of our situation we want to we want to take comfort it says wherefore in the scripture says wherefore Comfort one another with these words talking of the Rapture talking about the Saints and those that are dead and but we comfort each other with these words we're comforting each other so now the same way now that the bride was in the Lord was like it was that Eve was in Adam before the Lord separated them see now now you could say well actually uh Eve wasn't actually because physically actually the Lord created her um from a rib and so on and so forth but actually when we read the scriptures we'll see another story because before Eve was taken out of Adam she was actually in him okay she was an attribute of Adam okay and now remember this quote that we just read here brother says attributes have to he said he said now attributes you know attributes it um he says here um all and all these things talk about he had an attribute to be son next thing attribute to be healer next thing attribute to your savior and all these things had to display themselves they have to an attribute is something that actually has to manifest itself now sometimes sometimes like like let's just say um brother John oh yeah brother John when he was younger he he never had the attribute of being a nice like soft and caring it's an example bro like you know he until when he had his child suddenly the manifestation of the attribute of him being this caring loving father comes out see what I mean so evees in Adam although you can't see it sometimes it takes time time for that manifestation to come out and now who knows when you read the scriptures who knows how long it was it wasn't like the next day that Eve came out no it wasn't it wasn't like the next day it could have been I don't know we we're not in time back then in theory time when we came after the fall it's one of those subjects that you can go around what was first chicken or the egg you know you go round and round but um like if if you would look then we don't know how long it was but these things take time and and for the Lord to say well you know oh I don't want to get ahead of myself let's wait let's wait okay so brother man brings out now how attributes have to display themselves so now Adam at the point of him being created he had this attribute of a female part having a bride but that attribute was still in him okay now remember Adam was made in the image of God all right so we're just going to read that let's go to Genesis 1 26 and 27 Genesis 1:26 and 27 so it says here and God said now notice you know it's another subject you know but but notice in this very first beginning of this verse 26 he says and God said let us now maybe someone's got a question somewhere about that one it says let us make man God now one person it seems one person God says let us make man in our own image now if you notice creation everything else has been created now but if you read the scripture further on all things were created through Christ Jesus amen okay that's this one that we see here okay all things were created through them so now at this point in time that the the the the the uh the Lord God um is is creating Adam making man in his own image it's the Lord Jesus Christ that is's now speaking okay so the Lord is speaking saying let us make man in our will who's he talking to well there the Son and the father they're both one person but it's the son who's saying let us make man the the image that we are in this image that I am in that I've come out this logos and now I'm in this form that I've created the heavens and the Earth and I've already done all the animals and the herbs of the field and all the rest of it so now let us make man he's done all the animals from the great it doesn't matter which way it was from the Frog to the chimpanzee or or the from the deer to the horse whatever it was but he done it all but now he says let us make man now we're on another story so now he says let us make man in our image okay let's let's read so he's so it's let us make man so this one saying us is this is this us is kind of two beings it's kind of two beings let us make man in our image we could actually I could have we could have just gone on to the subject you know where brother says I was in David I was in this I was in that I was in across the Delaware River cuz I'm going to American but in Christ Jesus I was in Christ when I created the heavens of the earth if he was in Christ Jesus when he created heavens and the Earth then you know let us make manone in our image that attribute was there although we couldn't see it it was there so let's not get into that one let us make manone in our image after the like after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over the over all the Earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so notice however Adam was that's how the Lord Jesus was amen however James is you want to see to be fair I think I said this last time didn't I if you want to see what an Abbot looks like just look at me we got the big teeth and the big forehead that's it you know and that's kind of how it is if you want to see the Father the the father looks like look at the son but if you want to see what how the Lord looked maybe what you know Moses saw when he turned his head into the Clift of The Rock and what did he see back parts of a man you know in the image of Adam so if you you could say well if you want to know what Adam looked like well Moses knew from his back part anyway you know what I'm saying in the image of God created he them so now that's how the that's how the Lord Jesus was see if you want to look at Adam you look at the Lord Jesus you look at the same one because he's made in image okay image being um you know not not the exact facial features obviously but you know what I'm saying read between the line so notice notice here singular we can see this singular here it says God created man in the image of God created he him so that's verse 27 so this is singular we noce singular God created man singular okay uh in the image of God created he him him is singular okay and then he goes on to say male and female created he them so somewhere in here is this kind of mystery which is for the denational world to understand I'm sure they would be scratching the head but that's it it's not hard so without so now within Adam now with it not yet being manifest is this attribute of himself in Bride form and it took you know it is his Simon when the Lord put him to sleep you know I just wonder if it was like you know within 3 days that you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying it's nice it's these these types he he puts him to sleep and in that time we know the quote where talks about it we'll get to that later on how the Lord Jesus was in him on the cross but you see the Lord she she's in there although he not yet manifested she's still there now don't be confused with Eve being there but not there don't be it's it's it's a hidden it's not yet manifest why I keep saying this otherwise you're going to get someone confused thinking well did he have forearms and two four ex no it's not like that it's like James and John yeah so if we'd have seen now Adam before Genesis 21 let's just read Genesis uh Genesis 2:21 sorry read Genesis it's just over the page Genesis 2:21 uh 21-22 says and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Ammon and he slept and he took one of his ribs closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord took had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man so if you would have seen Adam before what we've just read here you would have seen one man okay if you would see Adam after that now you see two people yeah uh I'm trying to see where it says and he called their name Adam which one is it Genesis 5 where what 5 one no hey I'm glad we're family what is it help help me 52 52 52 this is uh that's it that's it there boom okay so it says male and female created we read from the verse uh verse one this is the book of generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam one name in the day when they were created that's it sweet thank you so we can see here that you know what we're talking about we can see these attributes that are not yet manifested now You' only seen one person before so the scriptures showing us that the Lord is pointing the scriptures pointing us towards the Lord being the same image as Adam now we we we've seen this that the brides hidden in Adam and then brought out a later date okay and the Adam at the point of Adam being created this is how the Lord looked right okay fine so we've read at the beginning which was Ephesians we've read how we were chosen in him let's just go back to Ephesians 1 I think it's verse 4 that one isn't it Ephesians 1 verse4 Ephesians 1 verse 4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love okay so before the foundation of the world although not yet manifested you were in his body in he you were in him in that form that only the Lord knows so back then which is this one we're talking about you the bride were in him now you were his body so just turn over Ephesians 1 22 and 23 it's just there and he hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all so already now listen although not yet manifested we can see now by reading this scripture your predestinated purpose for being here your it wasn't manifested but your purpose for being here is to be his body amen okay the body of the bride and you were just waiting to become manifested let's just turn let's go to Jehovah Gyra brother B says in 16 1964 God separated cuty the body the bride of Christ has to come right back to the first now Eve was he says what was Eve her and Adam was the same they were called Adam they were Spirit when he formed man the first time he made him in him his own image and God is a spirit in the image of God created he him male and female created he them he was and then still there was no man to till the soil then God formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth and put this Jewel Spirit into him and that was the first Adam then when he separated Eve from Adam Adam fell by by disbelieving the word see that's right that's where the church fail today disbelieving the word okay so you can see how we we see how Eve came from Adam Adam was made in the Lord's image and we can read that when we reading this we reading when we read about Adam here when we see this quote where brother R's talking we are seeing ourselves because the Lord's already shown us that however Adam is that's how I am so now we can see it's it's it's got to be a perfect timee it's got to follow it's got to follow let's see rising of the sun I'm just trying to get a few a little background brother bam says uh and the rising of the Sun the spirit left him now this is now the typing of the Bride Christ and the bride we've looked at the eve and Adam this is this is Christ and the bride the spirit left him in the garden of Geer he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was God God anointed that flesh which was human flesh and he didn't if he went up there as God he would never have died that kind of death you can't kill God but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you in him see God had I love this quote God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body seed they are one the same the same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride that's that's just that's just quite mindblowing really we're looking at a predestinated purpose and we're looking at our our position in Christ is predestinated predestinated means it's already planned out you know our I like to I'm a bit thick but you know I like to break it down like the our destination is pre it's predestination you know it helps me to kind of see it now it's like the old satav that was set up back then you know it's done you know before the foundation of the world so now I've got a question where did I begin where did you begin notice you know I personally I was manifested in 1980 yeah but when did I begin see what I mean when did you begin see we've got no memory of this but we're in this we we we we were an attribute of God back then you know way back before the world began and you know we're actually learning and growing and through the Revelation Lord is showing us what our identity is we've we've got the mirror of the word that becomes clearer and clearer and we're seeing the picture daily clearer amen you know it's it's like these tiny little pieces that come together here a little there a little you know um he kind of paints a picture you know I went to um went to Germany went to uh brother Andreas had was like a a chist like a family get Camp Family Camp convention and we went to a place called wburg it's where Martin Luther wrote the old um translated the Bible and uh it's it's it's a castle on a hill and unfortunately the guide wasn't that interested in Luther and they took all the time showing this huge castle well in this Castle there's this there's this room that is absolutely humongous it's huge and and it's it's just a one huge Mosaic you can look at it Wiki I guess and I think it's called the El Elizabeth room or something but it it's made up it's it's it's it's the roof as as I remember it's the ceiling the walls theyve got these colise things and it's it's this huge Mosaic I think those are a milliion 500 little pieces which I'm sure now dayss it would be like yeah big deal but back then I mean we're talking like you know it's it's huge so now but when you kind of get close up and you would kind of look real close you'd just see kind of blurry but kind of when when you kind of stand back and you can see all these little pieces come together suddenly you start to see what the picture looks like and the message the picture of the message if we would just kind of stand back and see all these little Revelations that the Lord shown us here a little there a little then we would see what was in the mind of the Creator way back there when you were still just in attribute form you would see it and so that's what we want to do we just want to try and Rise a little bit higher and see the picture a little bit clearer you know I um I think I think once I uh I ministered once on um back at home you know this there's like a city there houses here and houses there and there like this one's a like a castley thing here and and and and it's a wall City okay and this is the word this is this is this is like you could say message churches so this is like a wall all the way around the city is this wall and um and and so you get these you get folks that'll stand in in the city and this is all the word of God all these buildings are all the word of God right and this one is maybe uh this one's maybe Luther's message Luther Luther and this one's maybe the seals seals and uh want to say Luther's message like justification yeah justification and maybe this one's the the baptism baptism ISM and you know you get you get all these different parts of of of the message and this guy that's looking here now you got to read between the lines what I'm trying to say he's looking now from his point of view he can see this so he's uh he's uh uh how do I go that one look at that his his uh bck Winkle his um the angle of his view the angle of his view is is like he can see this much okay and he can see this one and this one and this one now you got somebody else who's here on this side and he can see this one but actually if you would look at the angle of his view there's a piece that he can't see so that's what you get you get oh like like in the message somebody might just grabb something and run with it and and actually they are right they're right they're seeing it how it is but they can't see the one behind it and the Lord's constantly telling us to come up higher because I can't draw an eagle but we're supposed to be this big eagle this big eagle flying higher and we can look down so we're trying to kind of we're supposed to rise higher and if you would just stand higher suddenly you can see all these little facets of the message so that's why we're trying to do we just want to raise a little bit higher and just kind of see all these little bits of of the word here a little there a little and build up this Mosaic picture of the revelation of Jesus Christ because you know so what's so important about knowing who see for me this I say burden like this it's like you've got to know who the Lord is you've got to know who you are because the revelation of Jesus Christ includes you this one if you this this is your identity the revelation of Jesus Christ is you and if you think about the word revelation it's it's the revealation of who you are it's the taking of the the the blanket off the statue it's seeing who you are it's revealing everything that was here back in him way back before time was amen all these attributes of God the revelation of Jesus Christ is showing us we've seeing this picture clearly of how he is his eternal plan and everything and it's including you you are part of the mystery of God you are part of this mystery and this mystery has been hid since the beginning of the world since the foundation of the world the mystery has been hid you've been in him that doesn't mean you didn't exist it just means that you weren't manifested yet amen now we have to realize that you are here no way or form are you here by chance in any way if you're sitting here and you haven't met the Lord yet that's not my chance if you're sitting here and you're praying for some some it's not by chance everything there is nothing here about us that is by chance in every way and and listen everything all of now I'm not talking about um you know the person here that I me I've got to be careful we don't get too many amens here the person here that likes that likes Taco Bell or whatever it's called you know we're not talking about that that's just junk we're not talking about somebody who likes uh this car or that car but we're talking about the attributes of God we're talking about those attributes of God and everything the attributes of God where the Lord's dealt with you in your life everything was in here I keep pointing down here you know what I mean I mean there so everything was in here everything that you are those things that the Lord's made you you see but it's only now after all these years after such a long time that you see the manifestation of what was in there it's coming out now we're seeing look we are seeing as the Lord changes us who was I with the other day I was with somebody and they told a real nice Tess brother bro jiah jiah tell him his testimony how the Lord came to him each test I'm not lifting one up the other it's just that's the one that comes to mind so brother it's like the testimony things that he sees things that the Lord shown him it's like this is now the character that the Lord's made in each brother here each sister here is this what was in the mind of God before the world began we see the Revelation the revealation of what was in God's mind for brother Brian you I mean sister Anna and Amanda see we can see that we can see it's revealed you what I mean and now you know the attributes that were hidden are sitting here back then it the Lord was male and female because he created him in the image of Adam it's clear but back then you couldn't see it but now I'm actually looking I am physically looking at what was hidden in God before the foundation of the world I'm physically looking turn around and look at your brother and sister look at them you are physically looking at what was there oh well I don't know what was there I'm looking at it see what I mean you got to see who we are it's in plain view we are not here by chance every little you know I don't think you even say in German we say an e canob we've got a corner missing in Swiss we say you know every little corner every little twitch that we've got the character that the Lord shaped it's there for a purpose amen there for a purpose let's just turn to Psalms 139 Psalms 1 139 Psalms 139 and we'll read 13- 16 13-6 the Lord's good it says for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb now just I mean that just blows your mind away just but David Goes further yeah I mean like whoa whoa whoa you covered me in my mother's womb it's like whoa boom no no no David Goes further yeah I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them wo so now David is saying here but I mean I'm just going to put it in modern language my grandfather wasn't even born my grandfather was still getting flipped over in the furrow with the plow really between the lines yeah we we come from this Earth You Know mother eats minerals and stuff where's the minerals come from the lettuce where's the lettuce come from the ground so the minerals and vitamins were still getting flipped over in the furrow of my great grandfather when the Lord saw me your brain just turns to Mush when you start to think about it think about it curiously amazingly put together and now notice David is saying here that that I wasn't even born Thine Eyes verse 16 Thine Eyes did see my substance the minerals that were getting flipped over in the furrow okay when I uh yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them yeah the Lord saw us in the Lord's book we were already written we were already done although not yet manifested so now I just want to draw this one wrong one here you go moving to one side so I want to and draw this one this is uh this is who can I pick on it's a man I've drawn a man so it's brother Gabe this is Brother Gabe brother Gabe is somebody who's been through a lot we've all been through a lot but brother Gabe's been through a lot so now here's Gabe and I'm going to go back a few Generations Mom oh I can't spell m mom and dad okay Mom Dad my hands going to be dropping off by the time I'm finished Mom Dad Mom Dad Mom Dad Mom Dad wake me up when I'm done Mom Dad Mom Dad Mom D Mom Dad are your brains turning to Mush yet not from bordom from like whoo this is crazy Mom Dad Mom Dad okay so we have physically gone back this is Brother Gabe this is his generation that's one that's actually when he was born here actually he's born here uh two three it's that three generations is that right I think that's right sweet so let's just say let's just say brother Gabe was thir brother Gabe's parents this is time here this is time obviously it's time time okay brother gab's parents were 30 years old they were 30 okay when brother Gabe was born now you've got 30 years here because of their parents you got 30 years here because of their parents and 30 years there we've only gone back three gen like 90 years yeah we've only gone back like 90 years forget the 4,000 years since Noah like uh like yeah no like forget that that we've gone back 90 years just forgive me I can't understand it it's just it is so phenomenal it just your mind begins to look you know I don't want to get into it too much brother gab's parents were 30 that's quite a lot of life before brother Gabe was born yeah but he had to be conceived you know what I mean on a certain day right yeah and how many chances how can I say this how many chances of brother Gabe being born could have been over the 30 years yeah you know because his mom and dad were mom and dad and they lived as Mom and Dad right and it's not just you know you know what I'm saying it's the the the the chances are just like so then you know we sometimes we have parents that don't have a baby for like 10 or 15 years is then suddenly once born this is not by chance this is because this particular in order to get brother Gabe exactly as he is this particular one here had to wait 10 years because it had to be born in a certain way on a certain day during a war so that there would be that fear and certain C or missing from Brother Gabe in a certain situation or the way that he's just strong and he's just you know he's just you know he had to be that way and he comes from there yeah it's like you know people some some brother and sister I don't want to know but somebody maybe they kind of ho stuff you know ho stuff like kind of gather stuff up and without knowing it that's the character that you guys are a lot of people laughing at me right now and without you knowing it it's coming from the war or whatever it's been the time of depression in the I think you in the 20s wasn't it the 20s that time time of depression and within you is that built-in fear which makes you gather all the stuff and the Lord's got it in way I'm just telling some story that that that you can't even throw the tracks away that are old and smelly until you die it's all right you're laughing until you die and then the person that cleans out your house picks up the old smelly tract that you couldn't throw away reads it and comes to eternal life do you know what I mean you know what I mean it's it's just like you can laugh it's fine we're all good it's you see what I mean like every you know predestination goes further than what we think and you know brother R would say maybe hopefully it's not sacriligious look the timber that this Pulpit is made of you know how much they say that they say I think it was brother Steve golden was telling Josh something about the guitar how it sounds better older it is or the music that tones the wood or something you know how tone this wood is you know how much word this is soaked up yeah phenomenal so don't tell me that the Lord knew what exactly the materials that he would choose to have his word delivered and the the chairs that you're sitting on goes further than we think so now that's in the natural which to to the Lord yeah it's phenomenal but it's actually not that important you are important and everything about you is so important we've gone back like 90 years here and each parent has gone through Wars trial tribulation and everything listen you know within your I don't know much about it but you know the old DNA stuff it's got um like an imprint of everything about you in it your eyesight everything you need you know have you ever thought that maybe somebody's been given bad eyesight because they're not supposed to see something I don't know it's just the way that the Lord's doing it he's caring over your soul he's not looking like to to to to the things around you that's all to do with it but you see what I mean it's your soul it's your character it's that Eternal part of you you know the DNA is just so complex that it begins to blow your mind you know the the the job that your great great pick pick a number pick a number this goes back forever this one here this this one here this one here brother Gabe you you don't even know you can't even you know your granddad your granddad and maybe a great grand but you don't even know the next one that's how you know what I mean but let's just say this one was was a carpenter carpenter okay and May and maybe he I don't know when he was 21 tripped and broke his leg and something and within him there's a fear of slipping on ice and it's come all the way brother Gabe had to have that I think we need to you say Simon you're just waffling on now no you've got to understand this plan of predestination and we see the natural types and who we are and how we are and then suddenly we can start to see the spiritual types and how the Lord's chosen us to manifest himself and we have to be in this kind of form that the Lord's made us in in order of him to manifest himself to the full potential you know brother R tells a story I'm just going to read this he tells a story of a pigeon that saves lives so this is time of the first world war brother so it's uh God hiding himself in Simplicity in 63 but says in the time of the first World War I had my father's older brothers there and my cousins were in that war many of them got killed but in one place there was a whole Regiment of soldiers American soldiers pinned out the German Army had pinned them down and machine gun fire big cannons whatever they had mottar fire whatever it was had them pinned down they couldn't get out and there was no way of getting out there was a whole Regiment of soldiers perishing in there because they was on every side they had planes they D send one up shoot it down a man tried to get out well just on every side there was nothing the Fine Guns failed all the military strategy had failed they were pinned in by the enemy there was no way of getting out there was nothing and finally one little soldier came up found a pigeon one of those Homer pigeons he calls it Homer pigeon homing pigeon that was their only hope they wrote a message and thought if this pigeon can only get through back to the main headquarters where it came from can take this message a message pigeon a messenger pigeon that was the only thing they had a simple little pigeon all their military things had failed but they got a simple little pigeon and they wrote the message and tied it on his little leg turned him loose with a blessing and a prayer that he would make it and of course the Germans seen the white pigeon going they fired at it and everything else one bullet went through his wing knocked the feathers out one stripped around its neck and cut his craw off the other struck its leg pardon me that had the message on it but this poor little pigeon kept flying trying to get the message in he must there was lives at stake finally with his struggles flopping in the air turning and fly and fell and he fell into the barracks of the camp where the soldiers was one soldier picked it up looked at him this little fellow said he's been shot he opened looked on his little leg on his little bruised leg and there was a note they read the note and it was covered in blood though covered with the message got through it got through they sent reinforcements quickly and saved the whole Regiment of soldiers if the little pigeon hadn't got through all them men would have perished and what a disaster that would have been right I've got a question for you have we ever looked at this story with a different angle you know what if brother Branham tells the story what if this one here this one here was one of those men see what I mean well if that was one of those men and through God's predestinated plan yeah and and we can we can look at the word so many so many different ways but just think about it if they had perished that one had perished yeah and then where would you be where would Anthony be if his great great-grandfather had perished he wouldn't be here see the Lord watches over his seed he his seed let's just read God hiding in simplicity already pardon me that starts the one with um with brother B but we read here how how look he says he says that would be such a terrible thing if the pigeon hadn't got through all them men would have perished what a disaster would be listen amongst the soldiers there was a seed laying there look and I know that's true because it's the same for me you know my my my my grand my granddad was uh my granddad was sent over I think it was like 2 three days after D-Day I I don't know that much about history I never really listened to be honest but you know I wasn't very good student went over to a D-Day and and just the way it all happened was him and his best friend there was there was mortifier coming in pardon me they jumped into a ditch together and when my dad woke up my granddad woke up his best friend was gone and his leg was gone but if he hadn't have survived where would I be you see how many times do we see these situations where you know it just it just it's phenomenal protection of the god over his seed you say well what do you on about why are you going on about this let's move on whoa whoa whoa slow down this is directly got to do with this amen because if you weren't here today how can you manifest God Amen how can you manifest God you know the Lord he shows us he's showing us how important we are we should we we need to see like the true predestination what it means to be truly predestinated then we can begin to understand who we are and why we are because I'm telling you what each one of us we've got we've got we've all got questions Lord why am I like this is it just me is it just me like like Lord why am I like this why why why listen this has taken thousands of years of complexes and problems to make us the way we are and he for a reason you know I just hope try I hope this kind of helps you to understand as well you know one one person's nervous one person's quiet and it seems everybody's unhappy with the way they are is anybody happy in here of how they are I mean come on is anybody happy no we've all got the why and we all question but I tell you it's for a reason it's for a reason you know God's made us this way for a purpose he wants to manifest himself through you and in order to do that to express himself you've got to a certain way remember you are expressed to all men you are Epistles read of all men you're the god word word of God on display let's just read brother says in 1963 look he says I love to shoot now he's talking about himself like and brother R had this question himself why why why Lord why says I love to shoot and targets not here long ago squ hunting down in Kentucky and I had a little model 75 it sounds I hope it doesn't sound sacrilegious to you to say this in a sermon but I will tell you I'm trying to make a point and this little rifle I trained it in and I've dealt with and dealt with fools and fooled with kids fooled with guns since I was a little kid I love them and this little model 75 I could just every time hit a squirrel's eye at 50 yards with it that's pretty good I had a paper from a range down there signed up driving nine bullets through the same hole at 50 yards on a rainy windy day I got it signed up and notorized and that was the Lord helping me of course to do that that's unusual I say brother always he doesn't boast some of us can do good things the Lord also through this whole family tree thing we've got skills some of us have got skills to do things like that are unbelievable I mean like painting you know what I'm saying it's amazing like the painting but that's a blessing to somebody else and there's Carpenters there's Builders and there's welders there's there's people brother Richie is brother Richie just got skills in like knowing stuff about stuff you got brother Jonathan who's just like wires everywhere and he knows what he's doing but it's a blessing to somebody you see what I mean it's it's it's the Lord's so so it's not but we don't ever say well you know I mean you know what I mean no it's like oh the Lord helps me so brother R he's got these strengths but the Lord helps him he always realizes it's the Lord that's helping him so brother R continues he says I started to shoot the squirrel I found out I hit him somewhere else beside the eye I got nervous and I tried again on paper that's stick a piece of paper I guess and he wouldn't hit the target I couldn't hit with or quarter of an inch which is like that much or half an inch or something 50 yards but I knew I could do uh it would do better than that I've done everything to the gun that I know how to do nothing seemed to fix it up right so I wrapped it up in the Box send it back to to come the Examination for rebedding they wrote me a nice letter said I've uh I have my file at home said Reverend Brandon that rifle Will Group an inch that's that that much at 25 yards so it's it's just a model 75 it's not a T gun it's just a little plinker he said you'll never get any better than that now that was intern a company that made the gun an inch at 25 yards 25 yards is here to that wall over there um an inch and I drove nine straight holes at 50 yards so now here's my thought my wife said now look Bill she said if the company that made the rifle will say that it won't do no better than that then who are you to say that I said honey but here it is what it is I don't care what the company said I've seen it do it and I know way that'll do it and I sat down there when the other Brethren so now notice now immediately now he's going somewhere where he's out shooting the old squirrels okay and he says and I sat down there when the other Brethren were shooting at squirrels anywhere they wanted to hit them was all right mid Center back or whatever I sat under a tree and I was crying I said God I'm so nervous I can't hold myself together why did you make me a little nervous fellow like this and I realized I'm standing here the Bible before me and a voice just as plain as you would hear my said you were made thus for a purpose now this this picture here this is what it took to get brother Bram to where the Lord could use him this is what it took for him to be so nervous to do anything wrong yeah you know to get something wrong all these complexes that you know things that he had to go through to be molded and shaped into what God saw before the foundation of the world in order for him to bring the word to be able to take the sword of the word and to carry it his character had to be so shaped he was entrusted with the message amen so now remember just as we step along these Stepping Stones remember we've looked at Adam and Eve we've looked at the Lord Jesus and the bride we've looked at all these things we looked at the complexes we looked at predestination of the of the uh each one of you sitting here and we looked at brother bam how he's been shaped and molded and entrusted with the greatest Revelation ever right so nervous it had to be right okay and when he couldn't just do something in the natural that he knew was right that he could do he just B broke down in tears why am I like this why look the message that the Lord's given us through the prophet it's his word it's himself amen John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was God the word was and but that's been handed down into hands of men entrusted with the word brother says things that are to be 1965 I believe that's the same thing we live today God bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do now we know that this is the day of salvation where God is calling men from around the world from a life of sin unto a life of service am so God is calling men he's not talking about himself only now men around the world from a life of sin into a life of service and in that day God poured out his Spirit from on high great signs and wonders to to accompany the ministry of this day this is when the former and latter Reign are falling together we know that there is supposed to be great signs and wonders in which many gr denominations great denominations this is turned down listen carefully now he says but I'm very thankful for these open doors that I've had to go into and the inspiration it's give to young men like your pastor here that's cause them as I'm beginning to get old to know that my days are numbered and to know that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in my generation which I'm hoping to see him and I look daily for him watch I'm keeping myself prepared for that hour so this same message has been passed On to the Next Generation the same message okay now I've got a question is it the same sword of the word that was put into the hand on Sabino Canyon or is it another sword is it the same word that was preached in through the seals and all the way through or is it another one listen it's the same word it's the same sword we all kind of sit there and like wow when when we think about like like and I say that respectfully absolute all like you know saino cany the sword coming down wo whoa whoo the same sword's been put in your hands the same sword it's not another sword we always can't look it's human nature we always kind of look to somebody else as a role model and to look to but actually the role model that we're looking to as it were have been looking to in the flesh is saying listen now it's your turn yeah now it's your turn it's the same sword it's the same message yeah it's being passed on down and I'm telling you listen think of this it takes the same amount of reverence and sincerity yes for to stand here as it did for brother BR am think about it the Lord said to brother man you've got to be more sincere for this what have you seen the life that brother B lived have you seeing the life that he lived and he had to be more sincere well has the revelation of the word backed off since then so the level of sincerity has that backed off no n I tell you this is it's it's it's serious no wonder no wonder you get nervous you got to stand here look listen the king of glories just handed his sword down into even my hands this morning said Simon go forth and slay the enemy I tell you what no wonder you get nervous no wonder you're out back shaking and like a leaf because the sword of the king listen when brother oh yeah oh that's a nice sword oh yeah sweet who brother says himself I've always been kind of scared of those things he like guns not knives you know what I mean like the like imagine how he felt when that sword was in his hands when he heard this is the sword of the king yeah imagine how he felt he must have been shaking like a leaf is it any different for us amen come on listen we have been chosen to carry this message on you know we've been chosen to carry on listen you've been chosen to display the word of God in this day through your life we've got such a weight of responsibility to live the life of Christ you know that's why we live that's why we strive the way we do that's why we we we just want to be so careful to do things right oh that doesn't matter that work wo wo wo and brother I'm the one who drove like was it 2 hours back to take the orange back to the thing have you ever worked out how many hours that is that's 6 hours drive yeah he drives from the border 2 hours home he drives Back 2 hours to take the orange back and then he drives another that's 6 hours for me for an orange I mean just an orange CH it Chuck it in the bin and then you know say a prayer and no level of sincerity level of sincerity weight of responsibility listen carefully we talking about us living our life right listen we have to live that Sanctified life we have to if you don't live the Sanctified life then if it's not in you let me put it this way if it's not in you to live the Sanctified life then kind of you weren't here you know what I'm saying this wasn't you it's in us to live this Sanctified life we have to live it it's in US listen we would never listen we would never misquote the scripture to anybody would we no I mean even I mean even you know if there somebody in here perhaps who's just being like a little bit distant from the Lord and a bit you know however you may be or you know I don't know the hearts of everyone here but if there's somebody maybe there's somebody new coming here and you just like well you know I mean I can see a little bit this but you know I can't see everything but listen we even those those guys you you'd be surprised that um if you ever see sort of teenager people unfortunately teenag middle life whatever it is who are kind of a bit like um wavering and and and we're there to help each other yeah so we go we don't judge them we go and help help them but if we see somebody that's wavering even that person has got so much respect okay that you would never misquote the scriptures to anyone right so I want you to I want you to get this home you would not misquote like Satan did in the beginning Thou shalt not surely die is there anybody in here that is ever tempted to add one word or take one word from it then why don't we live the life because you are the word of God expressed yeah see on one hand we we've got such respect for this that we would never misrepresent or misquote this and yet he's saying that this is you so we've got to be so careful that day by day every day that we live if no one's watching you and you're going down the 75 home and you know you're doing 80 when you're supposed to do 70 he's watching you someone's watching you somewhere what is it this level of responsibility it's this sincerity that we have to come to you would not misrepresent the scriptures don't misrepresent your life because your life is the scripture am you are the written Epistles of God read of all men come on you have been chosen to display this message and everything around the message to the world you listen you've been chosen before the foundation of the world to hold the sword of the Lord am think of it the word and he shaped us just like he shaped brother mam he shaped each one of us in such a way that we are so we feel we are just so it seems like we're battered you know at the end of the day me Old Nana me Nana used to love cooking jam tarts for me they were the best but you know when she'd been making the old dough to get it into shape she give it a good slapping you know what I mean if you want to get it into shape you've got to give it a slap you know what I mean and that's kind of how it is we've been shaped we aren't just here like that we've been shap not only by our parents we've been shaped by all those Generations back everything so listen we have to listen carefully we have to manifest God so perfectly to the full capacity in this day that you have got to be shaped to Perfection Perfection does not mean we look like some kind of sweet guy yeah on the outside Perfection means your character mate the Lord's chosen us as his vessel to carry on his work let's read it that's is just this this is just mind-blowing I know I think brother Chad read this a while like shortly P paman Church age um notice the harmony of the Father and Son never just never did Jesus Jesus never did anything until it was first shown him by the father should it be any different for us hey should it be any different for us amen come on come on that doesn't mean you got to see the writing on the wall yeah that mean we all know the word we all know how we're supposed to live and so if you go out in the morning look if you go out in the morning and you walk past the mirror and you put some color on your face the sisters or the men you wear some trousers that are a little bit too tight you know you're doing wrong amen listen carefully you know it's it's really nice thought oh it doesn't matter look maybe somebody who's kind of a bit wavery a bit shaky in the faith and maybe a young one maybe the they want to be popular so they put on some tight pants the boys or maybe the girls put a little bit of paint on listen carefully see that picture over there amen if I would take a pen right now and I say this just respectfully right if I would take a pen and start to put some coloring on that picture yeah I would be carried out of here in a bag listen carefully yeah by the same people that are shaky in their faith because that's why we're here today we're shaky in our faith right but you're not shaky in this you love the Lord that's why you're here you see what I mean yeah you've got such respect for the word of God you've got such respect for for for a picture of the Lord Jesus right and so would I you break your legs so why is it that we can feel that we can put some stuff on our face when it's this one come on listen I'm showing you you are him you are the female part of him if I would go and just add a little bit to that picture you'd kill me how does he feel about you come on how would you feel if I took that picture and Photoshop it I think they called and put some tight pants on come on put a shirt like like one of these jackets that they wear nowadays it's so tight it comes after at the back come on how would you feel that's showing disrespect what about you you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you are God's Dwelling Place you are God expressed come on come on you know you are his chosen vessel to live through amen I'm not being nasty I'm not trying to like put you down try to lift you up and say look at your position come on look up I didn't finish this pamine church age Pam in church age notice the Father the the the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first shown him of the Father John 5:19 the harmony now exists between the groom and his bride that's it this same Harmony listen you don't do nothing until the Lord shows you we need to listen to that Small Voice you know Al Bet you know you the Lord Jesus when he hears from the father it wasn't like a ding ding ding ding ding oh you know uh go to this place pray for this person D no it wasn't it's quiet voice quiet Small Voice just get up walk away do something just get up walk away do something we're the same for us we don't hear the big voice we need to listen to that Small Voice on the side so the harmony now exists between the groom and his bride to show her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for it's the same seed be planted the water will raise it up again pardon me here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has the sayith of the Lord listen if look if this is uh how do I do this I got all these things here right here we go this is uh brother brother uh brother Ben seabolt this is Ben now for him in order for him okay to speak okay it has to be if he says anything it's Theus sayith Ben say something Ben something something there you are he just said something now I can now quote Ben and say thus saith Ben something see what I mean because it's Ben that said it yeah so if it was the Lord that said it if it's thus saith the Lord then it has to be him if it's not him it's not Theus sayith the Lord is it so actually when this one here now speaks when this one speaks it's thus saith the Lord now notice here brother Ram says she has she performs the command of the word in his name for she has listen carefully listen listen don't miss this and it's a shame we haven't got it up here so you can see it listen she performs the command of his of he of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord she commands she every word that she speaks is in his name I'm not sure if I've said it before but um brother John brother um Chuck and sister Colleen she does without her knowing anything she does everything in brother Chuck's name what's your second name Chuck what's your second name Frei Frederick is that your second name no no no your surname huh Williams sweet so without knowing it she does every listen she wakes up in the morning and she makes a coffee in his name MH yes she's taken his name amen she does everything in when did we take his name we never took his name we always had it we were in him back then although not yet manifested it's the same thing so now this is what's talking about the bride of Christ she has the mind of Christ so she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name she can't help it for she has thus saith the Lord eight then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like the seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose listen if we're living right okay the words that you speak will not come back void it's him speaking it's him speaking you if she has the sayth the Lord the only way that she can have the sayth the Lord is if yeah she is him amen it's if if he speaks through her that's the only way that is physically the only way I mean am I am I stupid or something brother brother I can quote now for the rest of my life brother thus saith brother Ben seol something that's absolutely the truth he can only speak it whatever he speaks is thus sayth then and whatever she speaks now because of this kind of revelation of the mystery that's been hid whatever we're saying and doing which is why it's so important that we live right is this thus sayith the Lord right continues he says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord all they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the words fulfilling his own word mate fulfilling his own word ful fulfilling his own word okay mate this is he did not complete all his work while he in his Earthly Ministry and remember this is pick up his pen this is pick up your pen this is direct from this is actually this one who's telling brother Bram to write this down this one here this one here is saying listen listen Adam's like this you want to know what I look like this is Adam right yeah okay this is how I am I am this one this is Adam this is me you want to see what I look like look at Adam and now the same one is telling brother I'm tapping on his shoulder saying pick up your pen and write this cuz this is how it is this is how it is she has the sayith the Lord because it's me yeah fulfilling his own he not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that sister Colleen knows that when she goes shopping she's doing it in brother Chuck's name she do you know what she doesn't even think about it yeah she just does it she knows what to do with brother CH I hope brother Chuck's will she knows that he likes his choco pops I'm just saying do you know what I mean she knows the Lord's good right okay so he says uh didn't complete all his work while in his Earth Ministry so now he works in and through his bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now and now we see again just quickly this this this even though you were back here it wasn't yet time for you to be manifested it wasn't yet time there was a time when the attribute had to be manifested it had to come out there was a time and the time when the Lord Jesus was on his Earth it wasn't time to manifest himself in you back then it wasn't yet time but now he will fulfill through the bride the work which he left for this specific time it's crazy where is it that's mind-blowing we've been chosen to continue his work we've been chosen to complete his work you know we are we are predestinated to come to adoption you know we we're predestinated to to do his work and to to continue his ministry adoption means it's like at some point I'm trying to pick on somebody else now and I'm running out of options here it's like it's like uh don't don't smile at me brother that's it you're up that's it Justin so so uh Carter at some point Carter is going to be such a big fellow right that brother Justin is going to trust him so much then he says son take my ring you know what I me take my ring there's my cloak whatever you say in this in in in our situation our family life whatever you say it's going to be as good as me saying it that's adoption amen so you can see the weight of responsibility is huge but we are predestinated to come to that point sometimes you might be sitting there thinking Lord I'm never going to get there but just wait he will bring you to that point because we are predestination to get there the SAT has been set when back then we are here to do his work am and we know we are here we're predestinated to know what he wants done with his word amen let's turn to John the book of Book of John 20 John chapter 20 and as we read this just remember this quote that we've read from Brother bham talking about the position of the Bride the responsibility of the Bride how she's got thus say listen carefully she has thus sayith the Lord I'll just read this before we read this scripture I'm just going to read this quick because I we we made pauses in between those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise for they have thus sayith the Lord all they keep still they know that that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while his Earth ministri so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work work which you left for this specific time now we're going to read this John 20 19-23 19-23 and the Lord Jesus uh speaking here then the same evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples had assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and said unto them peace unto you and when he had said this he showed unto them his hands and he said then were the deciples glad when they saw the Lord now just pause here one second I want to see I want you to just quickly see I'm just I'm just I'm just on this is on the fly so just just just see this this this spiritual type here of of when you uh receive when you realize who the Lord Jesus is when you get to this point so suddenly now we get to this Revelation seeing the revelation of Jesus Christ we see our position we see the wedding ring we see what it means we see this picture we see all this so now the Lord Jesus reveals himself he shows them the hands they realize now who it is what's the first thing he does let's read it now what does he say then Jesus said to them peace unto you as my father sent me even so I send you then said the uh and and then and when he had said this he said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are are retained that's a crazy scripture that's the Lord saying that's crazy that's like what Brian whatever you say and listen when the Lord said it here he said it to you personally bro he said to you if you forgive someone's sins here I can in no way remember them at the white Throne judgment because you've already remitted it and if someone does something to you Josiah someone upsets you if you don't forgive them you don't know how bad it is for them at the white Throne judgment this is the responsibility put lives in your hands this is the Lord Jesus this is exactly what we've just read in this quote yeah she's got thus sayth the Lord listen our Eternal purpose Eternal words can you imagine so the Lord as soon as we gain this adoption as it were as soon as we realize who we are our position as soon as we see the hands the nail prints of the Lord and we realize and we we have this revelation of Jesus Christ and and we're all just so happy immediately he puts the ring on his finger and Meanwhile we're thinking well praise the Lord I'm a king meanwhile that means hey look at this responsibility you've got lives on your hands how many times like brother Ben you know preaching U on the pride of life and stuff you look back on your life and all the things you've done wrong yeah but I look back on my life and I think all I tell you back in the day I was horrible back in the day you would not have loved me hey talk about Road r rage rage rage I was just rageous I just wanted I was outrageous so it's like all sometimes you come into remembrance some situation that happened where you were absolutely Furious and you just wanted to you know get angry and it's like but Lord I've upset someone please forgive them what just forgive them for swearing on me I could you know sometimes you'll do something and you'll maybe say something or do something in a way that you upset somebody and they curse you you know they curse you right and you can feel the holy spirit's grieved someone's just cursed you somewhere in a car because you overtook stupid yeah and I got to pray Lord it sounds childish but I tell you this is the scripture amen you got to pray Lord please forgive them for swearing at me that was my fault don't hold it against them you've got to come on you've got lives in your hands whoever's sin you remit get rid of forgive is done and if you don't they're staying come on this is exactly what we've just read here she knows listen the thing is it's like it's like we talk about different things you talk about if you you know stick some paint on your face and it's a good example if you put it on there on the picture of the Lord Jesus you would be pretty upset but you do it to yourself and and you the things that we just say all these little examples yeah but if you would say if you would have somebody sitting here on a chair right now and you know either experience he gets to experience that what brother Ram experienc falling twisting falling in Hell Fire and you know when brother B was a child and he's going to fall like that forever and then he's going to be the white Throne judgment in bloody rags and then he's going to be sent to the Lake of Fire and so on so forth and you're sitting here every one of you sitting here watching him and he's crying his eyes out right oh you say look if you just forgive him then immediately that's gone and he'll just stand on and doesn't mean he goes to heaven or his bride but then he will just stand on whatever he does from you know if you had that chance IM me there's no question you yep forgive him forgive him in a heart amen but what about the person that you kind of like pushed in front of the supermarket yesterday do you know what I mean it's true because that person if you paint on the Lord jesus' face then you know on a picture of the Lord that not good that not good but if you curse the Lord that's not good yeah but remember this one so if you curse the bride you curse him the Lord Jesus says unto one of these little ones yeah of man if you offend one of these little ones it's better for you to be hanged about your neck and ched into the DPC who's been on a big before yeah I don't like water I can't swim that good and the cold I don't like it it's dark and horrible you know imagine being it's better for him to be thrown into the sea than to offend little Amanda sitting there yeah just to offend because she's so important she's a part of him so now we realize now so now it sounds Petty it's not this is the sincerity the level of sincerity that the Lord says you've got to be more serious you've got to be more sincere we've got to truly like just live that life you know what you it sounds D but brother Gabe I heard brother Gabe uh last was it last week week before the gab preached one thing that he said he stood out and you probably maybe some guys are sitting there thinking oh whatever but he said something about like tipping in a restaurant and I tell you that's that's affected me because I think how do they if I was talking to Brother John about it this morning I it brother John I was talking to somebody about it somebody it's like how does how that affects me it's like yeah Lord you know yeah it was brother John it's like it's like you know I just give him that tip I mean I haven't got that much money but you know what I mean I'd rather if if they would just like oh man again it's like whoa whoa whoa you've just said him again to the Lord see what I mean it's this to fulfill our everybody wants to be you know I said it again everyone wants to be the queen but no one wants to bake the the King's favorite cake you know everyone wants to keep you know just oh let somebody else do it no no no you are carrying the message you are a written Epistle of God you've got the weight of responsibility to live the life read of all men you you amen each one of us so now in that situation you know so went to the old Hunan yesterday and and and I had heard from somebody mentioned no names that she could be a little bit grumpy and and I thought Lord you know so she was nice she was nice mood yesterday I thought Lord I better just keep it that way and I give her trip you know what I mean thought Lord you don't want people to curse you yeah you me realize who we are it sounds Petty it's not Petty it's real it's this grave to use that word it's good word the grave realization of who we are amen amen you know what we read here is fits in perfectly with pick up your pen what the Lord Jesus writes she has got the she's got the Lord's will in her hands she's doing his will and that's why she does nothing but when he leads her to it we've got to listen to that Small Voice okay so we are this vessel which the Lord comes through so that he can now manifest himself as bride when the Lord was here he also wouldn't allow people to curse him behind his back if he could help it I mean sometimes you know I mean there was a lot of Jesus sometimes he just laid it down to the old Pharisees and I'm sure they didn't like him but do you I mean do you see what I mean we got to live that life of love and forgiveness we've got this predestinated position this calling that we've got and you know the calling this position this this High Calling that we have it's not just for in heaven it's not just for in heaven you know loads other PE people kind of think that the uh the calling that we have is just for when we're in heaven you know the the the kind of under the illusion that that well you know we're going to live here and just live well as good as we can you know and and then at some point it's going to be like his magic fairy just comes down and and we're just going to be changed and we're just going to be perfect it doesn't kind of work like that that's the whole point of the shaping and molding and making it's it we're supposed to be like Manana slapping the old pastry around to make it into the shape that she saw when when I said to her Nana can I have some Jam cake some some some tat she saw picture of me eating me Jam tat and so and so she slapped the old stuff around and made it into the shape and I love being H she was there and you know she she knew that so she saw that picture that she saw was manifested but it took a little bit of pushing around and making a molding and brother John and brother Bob and sister uh Susan you know in the uh in your restaurant back in the day you know the food didn't just make itself you had to make it and mold it and you your corn grits and all the stuff and I don't know the names of it you know what I'm talking about I haven't caught the Revelation but I'll get there it was it was I enjoyed it they invited us and I I never knew it was that good but he saw a picture of how it was and he had to make it and mold it to it's the same with us we use all these little examples and it seems silly but if we can just even for the young ones if we can just kind of understand a little bit how we are and what we are you know the Lord the Lord is showing us in this John 20 and 23 that we have got this higher calling we've got a higher calling and we're written Epistles read of all men the scripture says us we have this we we are the word made flesh today you can't push it off on somebody else amen listen brother Ram was the prophet he lived the life he is the bride of Christ all those things that's not going to help you yeah you got to be yourself you've got to get there yourself you are individually you have to realize and have the Revelation that you were there personally alongside brother Brandon you were there alongside Paul and Peter and jam and John and there's more than one John cuz I'm looking at John I'm looking at John and I'm looking at John I'm looking at John there's John there's more than one they're all there in the in the in that we have to realize we got to see who we are and the fact that we are here our call is to manifest of the Lord Jesus Christ to the world the world will see Christ through you so we need to make sure that they're seeing the right picture yeah amen now whether you've been called to be a minister or a housewife or a grandmar grandpa or a school Kitty we are just as important as each other you know the sad thing is is that many many children they they kind of feel like like it's it's an adult thing it's you are just as important you're just as important you're just so important we can't describe you know the Lord Jesus would be incomplete if one member of his bride was missing if I listen it sounds D but if I would uh take a like a hair from from my from my head and put it on the floor in in theory I'm now incomplete you know what I mean right so if you take anything away hair is a little bit tricky but you know what I'm trying to say if you take a piece of my ear or something that I'm suddenly incomplete and when you look at me you'd be like well he's incomplete and the Lord Jesus without you each one of you here he's incomplete amen and that goes for the younger ones as well so the Young on don't ever think oh it's just me I'm I'm only small and it's this that no we are listen it doesn't matter how much oh well you know this one's got a bigger Revelation that one well some of these kides here have got more Revelation about working maths out than I have you know but we're all we're all part of the same body we are one body you know but we are just as important and we are vessels the Lord's got you see these vessels that he's using to manifest himself and to manifest the attributes of himself he's got them in schools he's got them on the police force he's got them in shops he's got them on the building site in the engineering shop he's got them everywhere these are all these these these vessels that the Lord is using his through his bride as we've read there the Lord's doing it through his bride and he's doing that so that he can reach all the world the world will be judged listen the bride will judge the world you don't even have to stand there and judge somebody if you get what I mean just your life alone you know why we've just seen you know we've seen brother Dave yeah and and uh uh brother Dave and brother Craig you know cutting hair there the the Westwood Barbers they've been living that life now how long's it been brother brother Craig 30 20 30 40 years long time you've got 40 years worth of judging that you've done bro true right true why didn't you see that man living the life of God you've been there all those years you've driven past you've gone to that person in that shop you've done this you've done that your life alone you are the written epistle the Lord Brother R says that God will judge by his word and if you're the written Epistle of his word then you're also going to be a part of that see this weight of responsibility that we have the Lord's got in every possible situation he's he's got he's got he's got showing Christ in you the hope of glory your life there in Westwood Barbers and now brother Jeremy and Jack your life there is actually reflecting the hope of glory see when they see you they see something different they see the hope of glory they see a a way they see a road they see a street they see a physical call something that they can see the hope of glory Christ in you the hope of glory let's just turn a little corner if we can let's go to John 16 John chapter 16 John chapter 16 and we'll read 26-28 26- 28 so the Lord Jesus says at that day ye shall ask in my name now this is like back to brother colen sister Colleen and brother brother Chuck this is the same thing at that day um that day you shall ask in my name and I shall say not unto you that I will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because you have loved me and you have believed that I came out of God I came forth from the father and I am coming to the world again I leave the world and go to the father so notice now we've got this same story again there's Adam Adam I'm made him male and female here's Adam at the moment you can only see a man you can only see one but the female is in there and how you see Adam that's how I am that that's how I am you want to know how I am you look at Adam yeah but I can only see a man yeah it doesn't matter he she's in there you know cuz male and female created them so now we can show that the Lord Jesus is showing now I come from God and I go back to God what's this thing here where were you you come from God and you go back to God so when he's saying there's Adam look at Adam look at me he's also saying look this is me this is you I come from God the Father I come from the this this and I'm going back and this is what's with you it's the same story so although we can't remember it we too come back come from God and we will go back to God you know the bride we were born with um not knowing our identity we were born in a certain way that the Lord made us this there's this great big drama this play that's been playing out and and we've been made in such a way that we had Amnesia we we we were when we were born we didn't know our identity I've said look I've said this not here I've said it before it's like you know when you're born who's got to I'm going to pick on Blake Blake's got a little um oh my my mind's just Henry Blake's got little Henry so Henry knows that he's his dad now but when Blake was first had Henry he didn't know that Blake was his father now brother B talks about the sweet spirit being around the mother okay but actually if just just try to look at the little type I'm trying to bring Henry didn't truly know that Blake was his father and then he spends time with him and now he feels this love that Blake's got towards Henry and he kind of yeah that's that's my dad and he teaches him daddy daddy daddy you know and the Lord's teaching us you know say say son say bride oh bride bride you know we take these little teetering steps but but and just see the type I'm just I'm not tring be clever but now but little Henry he's still he he doesn't no 100% he can't lay his life on the fact that that Blake's his father he you know he he can't 100% he can't do you know what I'm trying to say but there comes a time when he gets more mature and this is why I say you got to read between the lines cuz now he's a teenager and he's getting sort of 15 16 and he kind of he kind of Walks Like Blake and and and Blake's got this this thing where he sort of scratches his eye you know my um what's my my brother does something doesn't he my brother my brother does something brother my brother does something it's what my dad does and it's what my granddad does it's all the say I don't know it but my brother does it and my dad does it so now Blake he's got this way of twitching his eye and and and as as Henry is kind of walking he notices that he Twitches his eye he's like mate that's like my dad and then he looks in the mirror one time and and he starts to get these funny wrinkles that all the Lambs have got now I'm just saying that I don't know if you've got them so brother Chad's listening don't be offended it's just off the top of my head you get these like that lines across like your forehead like in a specific specific way and he looks and he's thinking wow this is and then suddenly this Revelation drops in his heart that's my origin I am manifesting all the attributes of my father and this is how it's been with us we've kind of like been pondering over these things and even the message has been out for so long now and pondering these things and pondering but there Comes A Time even though we kind of feel the love from the father and Henry feels the the the the love from brother Blake there comes a time when when actually the true Revelation drops in his heart the true Revelation drops in his heart and that's sort of where we are so we can't remember we were born with this Amnesia we can't remember this is listen I'm telling you this is we've looked through the scripture this is the sayth the Lord this is absolutely straight from the scriptures right but we were born not knowing this and we were kind of like stumbling around and we had absolutely no memory of it but it took the prophet to re bring this message and the message was to turn our hearts back am back to show us where we come from Back to the faith of the original see and it's taking this message to point us back just like the soldier my brother M talks about who had the Amnesia he'd come from somewhere he had came from somewhere he had an origin but he just couldn't remember where it was from and we're exactly the same we didn't we did not appear here just by chance we came from God we came from God and you know the message is showing us who we are where we are let's just read where brother Brown tells this story of the uh the soldier it's in' 64 and he's preaching spiritual Amnesia and brother says a French soldier I was told I was told this little story before we Clos I didn't know it was even that late I got about 10 pages of notes left here get some of time notice a French soldier they got a bunch of soldiers in from the Army and they had this Amnesia it shock on the battle and they had a program and they called up and let the people who had missing loved ones call to see if they could identify those boys no hope for them maybe one or two out of it C it and then the rest of them that was going to put them in a sanitarium where they'd have to stay the rest of their life I we can see nice spiritual type there you know for us we've recognized who we are but there's a lot of people that are in a sanitarium for the rest of their life they've got no hope for them brother says they was going up a hillside the train pulling they stopped at a station and they let the boys get out and stretch their legs and the guards got out on the hill to watch them because with amnesia why they had to watch them so they watched one young fellow there he got out and he began to look around at the water tank he looked all around over the hill he rubbed his face and he studed and he looked again and he seen the water tank and he looked all around at the station he started walking and instead of the Guard stopping him they followed him he went up over the hill down a little path turned to the right and went up another little Hill and he came to a log cabin and he looked and coming out on the porch an old man with a cane in his hand come out threw his arms around him he said my love my my son I knew you would return they told me you were dead but I knew you would return and the boy came to himself his Amnesia left him he could identify who he was he knew his father that's right you know it's taken the water tower of this message to point us back to bring us to remembrance who our father is not is was but is and it's taken this water tower to show us our identity to realize who we are the Lord's been holding the mirror of the word in front of us and our eyes were all matted up brother B calls it mattered yes it's your American language all matted up like you know and brother B tells about how early in the morning when it's cold his eyes would be all closed did anybody else experience that anybody in here anybody in here at all boom I'm not alone cuz I tell you I had it all the time when I was a kid seriously cuz like you know we had we had no Heating in the house it was freezy I scratched the ice off the window in the morning to look out the window and my eyes would always be like glued together absolutely and I had to like rip them apart and like wash them out and that's so I know what that's like and so was talking about how how his eyes would all be matted up in the morning and but when I eyes were mattered up the Lord like brother Bram he he said oh his mom would give him the eyes have and I I didn't I didn't get that one I just have to go find my way to the bathroom and like look out my eye a little bit and like wash it out myself but you know if we've got the mirror in front of us and we can't see clearly because our eyes are mattered up then we kind of need some isav of the word to clear our eyes out and that's that's why brother tells that story he's telling that story to to show us that there is something that can open our eyes there is something listen you have to take something and put it on your eyes it doesn't just come from nothing we've got to take something and and then so then we can see clearly you know listen if you looking into the mirror and you can't see the mirror clearly listen guys the mirror has always been here the mirror was it's not like oh the mirror just can't The Mirror's always been here it's just that we couldn't see clearly our eyes were all like gunked up you know we always were a child of God we always were look at it we always were we've seen in the scriptures it's not some made up something we always were we just couldn't see clearly we need to see the reflection in the mirror the picture that God saw from before the foundation of the world that's the one we want to see clearly you know we we want to see that picture clearly because because if we see this picture then we want to bring ourselves in line with that picture you know we want to bring ourselves in brother R he sings a story he brings that story about the little boy in the mirror and you know why does he bring all these stories they're not here for a just for something they're here for a reason he's bringing these stories because because he's describing our situation you know we we've never we never saw ourselves until we climbed up those seven steps till we walked forward we've never seen it and the prophet the message he brought the isav to clear our eyes of our understanding and I like this because let's read Ephesians 1:18 Ephesians 1:8 we are living listen in the days when this scripture is fulfilled it's being fulfilled in these days Ephesians 1:18 it says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints it's awesome see in fact should have read verse 17 as well but it's fine see through the message the eyes of our understanding have been enlightened we we've been enlightened we've seen the water tower we we we we we kind of we we've recognized where we are and what's going on and the Amnesia has left us so we can now see the father like to read uh the invisible Union of the um invisible Union of the bride of Christ in 65 like my little legal story as you've all heard it the old an old farmer set a hen one time and he didn't have enough eggs to go under the H so he found an eagle egg they put it under him when the eagle was born it was the fun looking chicken them chickens have ever seen the little old Eagle going along on the head cluck cluck cluck the little e Eagle said I don't know what that thing sounds like but I'm following her anyhow and they went out into the Bard and begin to scratch manure piles she said cl cl cl this is good you join ours and this is what the little old Eagle he couldn't eat that stuff see he just went along with the chicken because he didn't know he didn't know what to do and then she went out there and she would get this or that and little Eagle he just had to stomach it but he did didn't know how to do it he'd seen all the chickens doing it but there was something different he didn't like that so one day the mother she knew she had to she laid two eggs she be to hunt for one uh for the after the other one and flying around searching like the great Holy Spirit one day he flew over the barard that denomination and she looked down there and seen this her little baby she screamed it was the voice that something echoed from inside him listen you know when you hear these things when you hear something just something inside you it's the water Tower something inside is just like mate that sounds right something you can't help it just something just like yeah that sounds right and sometimes we can't even understand why it's like but we don't understand it but we know it's right so he says his a voice of something echoed on the inside of him that sounds right like the real PR predestinated born German predestinated by God hear the word of God it's music to him he knows it's the truth he's tired of that denominational stuff anyhow join this come out go with us we've got a social party we've got this we've got that it didn't sound right to the little fellow she said Son you don't belong in that group anyhow you belong to me you're mine he said Mama that sounds real how am I going to get out said just make a jump I'll catch you that's all you have to do just skip down to the bottom here he says why it was put there by predestination you were for ordained you were for ordained to a Son of God you were in God before the foundation of the world you're only manifested in this day for his honor and Glory how can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God yes sir which you are a part of that word by predestination because look God is the word you believe it congregation says amen well then he always was the word in the listen he just said there's Adam there's Eve there's me brother R's just saying here notice here he says he says look God is the word you believe it congregation say yes uh wa a minute he says so he says I'm going up a little bit forgive me he says yes sir which you are a part of that word by predestination there's Adam there's Eve inside you are a part of the word by predestination because look the God is the word you believe it well then if he he always was the word in the beginning was the word he's quoting John 1 and if the Word was God then you were in God the word the part that you were to play was in God before the foundation of the world he seen you he knew you he predestinated it to you that's just like C capping the whole thing off really for me that's stunning we always were you always were an eagle you were just in the old barard however barard it was whether it was uh whether it was a Methodist Baptist end of the day like nowadays you struggle to find people that have come out of Methodist Baptist Pentecostal let's be honest cuz like you know the generation's moved on now so only the older generation that's come out from Methodist Baptist you know what I'm you that it's like most of the people have been born in the message so whether you're born under a message in a message church that's had a Baptist Spirit on it or a Pentecostal Spirit on it just read between the lines you know but whatever it is you sick of that junk and you've come out because you're an eagle and when the great mother Eagle came and called us to come up higher something inside recognized the water tower you just knew it were right right and if somebody says come up higher and you feel that it's right something inside you says it's right what are you going to do you're going to go up higher you want to go up higher you've got that desire to go up higher so now we know we're not chickens we are designed to fly we are designed to see this word we're designed to that's a terrible Eagle that's that we we're designed to see the whole thing clearly we're designed to fly come up here come into the heavenlies where you belong we are not supposed to be sitting down just like bouncing around we're supposed to be climbing in Revelation higher and higher you know back in the barnyard this is Simon by the way back in the farmyard there was five wise and there was five foolish you know and when they were first born yeah they were funny he was a funny I'm just saying now there's five eagles not one read between the lines the eagle was the funniest looking thing in the barnyard but those the old five wise five foolish but if you would put five five eaglets and five chickens in in in a barnyard together you know in the beginning as they're growing up together in the same church right they've they've all got feathers yeah they've all got little feet that have Got Claws Johanna knows a lot about the old chickens it's like they've all got beaks all of them the Eagles and the chickens yeah but the difference is is that when the Midnight Cry goes out and it's come up hither come up higher only the Eagle's got something in it that can fly because the old chicken is not in it to fly in fact he funny cuz brother John's got a few little chickens out those pullets he's got and the think they're Eagles it's like check me out I can fly and they're like flying up and smacking the fence they ain't made to fly but the eagle if he was there he'd just pop up and he'd fly see you are born to fly just set you've heard that cry set your wings to The Winds of Faith you've been born to fly and only the eagle only the predestinated Eagles in the old Barnyard could fly only them tell you you are an eagle you're born to fly we are a predestinated bride and we predestinate to fulfill what was in all the attributes that were in the mind of God from before the foundation of the world the lord is good I just say Lord show me you know there's a brother uh brother stayed was a few weeks ago a couple months ago now and he said he said you know he said he said I just some he's an evangelist goes uh into like the deep dark places that are crazy in the world and um brother Adrian gray I think some of you might know him is from New Zealand so he he said to me he said you know he said s he said he said he said nowadays he he said you know I find myself praying Lord show me to do today what you saw me doing before the foundation of the world and I thought mate that's so true show me to do today what you saw me doing before the foundation of the world I mean how perfect we want to walk in the Lord's will and if we can do that then we can suddenly manifest ourselves and manifest the attributes of him that he saw you manifesting before the foundation of the world Lord mature me make me this son that you can put the ring on my finger and say son whatever you say you've got the sayth the Lord whatever you say and I tell you when you get to that position it's not like oh yeah mate I've got your say the Lord no it's like Lord you mean Lord you mean you put this ring on my finger like you mean to say that if I remit that sin you're going to remit the sin yeah Lord you're saying if I don't forgive that person then they won't be forgiven it's like yeah and it's not this like wow it's like a Lord help me to do the right thing help me Lord you know we want to be placed into that Kingdom Romans 8:28 and 29 let's read that Romans 8:28 29 I haven't even looked at a clock I don't have a clock up here but I don't want to be too long I cut I had to cut every like half out so we we're all good all is well Romans 8:28 and 29 says and we know that and I think I've said this before but if you notice this is a this is a fridge magnet Romans 8:28 the first part of it is a fridge mnet because everybody wants to bake they like live the life but not bake the cake like everyone wants to quote the scripture but only half the scripture and we know that all things work together for them that love God full stop fridge magnet goes further than that it says to them who are the called according to his purpose what's his purpose you're the called right so what's his purpose amen the mystery of his purpose to reveal himself in you his purpose is that everything that was in here okay and we've only written a few things down here okay everything that was in here is manifested through his bride in the end time his character you know love patience uh longsuffering humility all these things these are the these the attributes of God where was I 28 to them who are the called according to his purpose for for whom and wait you know just just quickly it says there in verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that believe believe God to them that are the called according to purpose listen we can say definitely that we know that all things work together for good to these guys we know we know because this is predestination this we know is this faith that we have in predestination we know that all things work together for good we know that all the trials that we go through and and all the difficult things we go through to shape our we know that it's fine because we are called according to his purpose and he wants to his purpose is that he manifests himself and finishes his work through us that we have that that that humility and that life that that that that character that's been shaped so much that he can manifest himself through his bride verse 29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate for no is this what we're talking about he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren listen friends we are predestinated to be conformed to His Image there's Adam there's Eve Eve was the image of the female image of Adam amen the bride is the female image of the Lord that's how it is so back we we the L we been predestined to be conformed back to this one the drama that we're playing in it's already been written this is the whole point of predestination this drama this play that we are in we are fulfilling this we are manifesting these although not yet manifested but now are being manifested the attributes that were in the Lord Jesus Christ to be manifested through his bride we're playing our role It's a drama that we're playing in and it's already planned out now don't forget for all of us here you know from the youngest to the oldest if we can just clean our eyes of the gunk the matter what you want to call it do you does everyone call it matter is that brother Brown language everyone is that what you call it yeah matter yeah every matter every you if we can just clean our eyes a little bit Yeah amen if we can just see ourselves clearly you know we've listen we've been seing through glass Darkly but now we're in this face to face stage now we we've come up to the point to the mirror where the Lord's wiped our eyes away and we were beginning to see clearly and could it be could it be I preached this sermon like a year or two back cuz I've been in the I've been in the build uh I've been on the phone to the Builder Merchant and there was someone and all I could I don't even I haven't even looked for the song I'm not interested but all I could hear was her like could it be could it be could it be could it be and she's obviously singing to the radio and this just thought she could it be could it be that's so true could it be so this is like we get to the mirror and we're looking and it's like like I'm wiping the mirror and it looks like that and I'm thinking could it be could it be could it be this Revelation could it be we're getting to this face to face the mystery of of of of the mirror is getting clearer and clearer and the Mystery of our purpose what he's purposed in us you know we always were sons of God we always were but in the great theater role play thing that we're playing out here you know the part of the script part of the script that that that we've had to play is this soldier with amnesia part of the you know each I don't even I don't know much about theater or drama everyone's got like a script or whatever it is and and you've got you know everyone's got a job to do and you got to played the part and part of our role has been to have amnesia part of our role has been to not know who we are and then you know as as your identity as the mirror is getting clearer and clearer I think they call it not Crescendo that's music and finale or something you know the big finale it's like boom it's like whoa could it be and now we're suddenly looking at the revelation of Jesus Christ this great finale this this play that we've playing in the mystery of of who we've been all this time why we've been the way we are now we can see why is brother Gabe the way he is why cuz like 20 years ago did you Minister 20 years ago I don't think so 20 years ago however long right 21 years ago he wasn't ministering and he had such a hard life it's like why am I like this Lord why and like suddenly the time comes that it's manifest it's like that's why that's why we are carrying on his work as we come to a close we are fulfilling what he saw before the foundation of the world just turn to First Peter if you can first Peter 5: 10 1 Peter 5 verse 10 it says but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you look we've been looking at predestination we've been looking at our personal predestination you know and we' been looking about you know it says here how we are called unto his eternal glory there's only one Eternal so if we're called unto his eternal glory it means that back then when it was just God dwelling in his thoughts you were called when you were chosen in him you were chosen to manifest his glory that's that's that's that's what you were chosen that's when you were chosen Eternal means no Beginning No End if there's no Beginning No End then it has to have been back there although not yet manifested so now the question is when did he call you it says here but the god of our of all Grace who have called us unto his eternal glory so the question now is when did he call you when did we begin I was born I was manifested in 1980 but actually when would I begin when were we called when was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he said all these things it's kind of your mind gets a bit like you know because we start to think these thoughts and we just we can't put it together but it's like the Mosaic in the old Luther wbg thing You' got to step back a bit and just see the whole thing and just say Lord could it be could it be Lord help me just to see it you know he called us before the foundation of the world when he called us in Christ Jesus Remember the scripture in Christ Jesus and our eternal glory after little suffering you know suffering in this life is part of the script it's just part of the script it's part of the script and the script was written way back then the script us sitting here today was written back then he saw you you're manifesting what he want he wanted to have a bride that was hungry he wanted to have a bride that got here like super early for church because they want to hear from him he wanted the bride that was going to sit at his feet and just soak it up that's what he wanted is that you yes sir so therefore you are fulfilling his desire you're fulfilling his desire to have that that that bride part sitting hearing of himself hearing of your eternal security your Eternal the predestinated calling of you this is what he wants you're fulfilling that now and just this little bit of suffering in between it's part of the script that was written way back then you know everything that he is and Ever Was was back then everything you know you too were there you were there us being here today it was all there you know all your mannerisms and you know the old uh little lines and everything it's it's it's perfect it's perfect the mannerism is the character it's it's it's how it is it's it's God's thoughts being brought into manifestation God's thoughts being brought into manifestation we're the bride of Christ if we just realize that we know we didn't begin at Birth we didn't begin at Birth we we were manifested at Birth but we began back there although we were not manifest we were there we're attributes of God if you'd come forward brother Blake we're come from God we're going back to God you know let's read Ephesians 1:10 last scripture Ephesians 1: 10 in fact we'll read N9 and 10 Ephesians 1:9 and 10 says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him you know in the fullness of times at the end everything that we see here all these attributes that were in there together the Lord will gather them all back together and they will be in him in the fullness of times everything all going back we are going back we're going back to and we're not going to be because now we're manifest so we don't go back to being thought but we are still all one he's Gathering all things together in himself you know I just pray that the Lord takes this small word and you know and just and just encourages you just to show you who you are look the youngest one to the oldest one you know this this plan here this plan here you know many of us where is it this this this predes this is predestination and you know each one of us this I heard brother a a brother told me a testimony yesterday about um about a family member who had a who had a child when it was physically impossible it was physically impossible but you see like if we would this this this I'm going to choose this one this one had to be you see and now now somebody somewhere along the line somebody had to that in order for brother Gabe to be the way he was somebody let's just say oh way back here somewhere like somebody's wife unfortunately had to pass away because brother Gabe's got to be who he is but you see that wife passing away made the husband the way he is and so now his DNA it's still affecting brother Gabe right but he looks different on the outside because actually he married again and this this wife was part of brother gab's DNA but it was still in there from him losing you read between the lines you got like like you know one one of them one of we don't know all the stories there's so many stories see like you know one of them's got to be brought into a adopted into a family one of them's going to be this one of them's going to be that it's perfect the point I'm trying to say is that you are so perfect there is no mistake sometimes we sit there and we think Lord why am I like this you know there's nobody why am I why am I such a failure why did I why is it cost why is it why do it cost me to stand here my livelihood my business everything that's everything that you know when the Lord called me to the ministry all my big stuff all the big fan it just just dwindled away it's cost his personal stuff but it's cost me it's cost me to stand here because but the Lord's done it that way so that we are humble in humility we're com here and say Lord we are nothing why have you made me like this why did you make brother Gabe like why has he got to cry behind the the public why has this brother got to break down when he because it's the way that the words got to be brought across in humility it's just what the Lord's got for us that's all we can say the Lord's good you know one day we're going to see the end of this great drama and when we see the end of the drama what a finale what if not then we will understand why we'll understand why we'll understand all the the family you know all the little Corners missing the E and up all these little things you know why is it we don't know but one day we'll see one all we know is that the Lord wants us like this let's just stand and pray if we can Lord Jesus we love you Lord Lord Jesus how many times do I say Lord why did you make me this way Lord why can't I just be like everyone else Lord Lord Jesus but we're all called to to different jobs Lord to different things Lord and we're not we're not happy in ourselves Lord with what you've done but Lord help us to come to that realization that Lord how can how can we be upset Lord when we you've been made us this way for a purpose how can we even Challenge and say Lord why have you made me this way when you've done it for a purpose Lord then we're coming against Lord and we're questioning your will and your work Lord Jesus help us Lord we pray to accept Lord Jesus the way that we've been made to to say Thank You Lord to look back on all those family generations to look back on the grace of God your predestination it is absolutely mind-blowing help us Lord we pray just to realize that we are by the grace of God we are you how you would have us Lord help us Lord we pray be with each and every one Lord Jesus from the youngest to the oldest there's no one bigger no one smaller there's no one more important lord it's just it's just a small word Lord but we just want to be encouraged Lord Jesus to see your predestinated purpose in our life Lord Jesus help us Lord Lord Jesus Lord have mercy on us we pray we love you Lord as we just help us Lord to correct us Lord to live Lord not to misrepresent the word help us Lord to represent the word as it's written as you would have it lived Lord Jesus help us Lord we pray we ask a blessing on this place Lord my brothers and sisters here Lord Jesus help us Lord lead us and guide us Lord direct us we pray we just love you Lord say thank you Lord for all things be with us now Lord dwell in our hearts Lord manifest yourself Lord and have us do this day Lord what you saw us
