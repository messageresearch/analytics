Morning Lord abounds towards your children and we're so thankful for that and Lord we've come to this service to glorify and honor your name to Lift Your Name on High to sing your praises to magnify your name and now while we come to the portion of the service where we read from your word that you've ordained the preaching of the gospel and Lord we're giving our attention to that now we pray God that you would come and work through this method that you promised to work through or that you would take control of these lips and that you would speak your words of eternal life may you plant your seed in our heart Lord and may it bring forth a Bountiful Harvest pray you have your way and may your Holy Spirit move in our lives and may you bring the past within us what you've ordained for this hour we love you we ask that you would help us Lord as we look into your word may you break the bread of life to us in Jesus Christ's name we pray and while we're standing if we take our Bibles and turn to Romans chapter 5 we'll read one portion of scripture and let you have your seeds Romans chapter 5 verse 5. we're going to continue on with the topic we've been on in Discerning true love this would be Discerning true love part four in uh we'll begin with Romans 5 5 we've read this several times but I want to stay in the same thought and go through the scripture again Romans chapter 5 verse 5 and hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us amen you can have your seeds I want to start with this scripture because the things we've been talking about are so beyond human emotion they're so beyond human ability to love the right way amen because of the Fall everything within us in our human Spirit has been corrupted and so we have to have something more than just a human element and I'm so thankful that the love of God was shed in our abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost because this love that we're talking about is the love of God it is not a human love a human love Master it is not a human love uh um uh grown or perfected it's not that at all it's the love of God it's superior to the human element and so before that I just want to say that we've had a busy weekend thus far uh Friday night we were privileged to be at the Bible Believers Christian School graduation ceremony and we were able to take part in that we thank God for that and we got to see Abby baumgarners at Golden and Julie Hatfield all graduate so congratulations and God bless you all it's good to see that also my son David lamb graduates this year from homeschool and and then we have a college graduate Alex I believe um Alex Bartram graduated from college so God bless you all we wish God's blessing upon you and may God direct your steps from here forward amen amen so that was good that was Friday evening and then yesterday we traveled down to the Dayton area for the memorial service for sister Donna Howard's parents for her father Robert and her mother Susan Hageman and we all know the the difficult circumstances by which her father passed away her mother had passed away in 2021 and because of covert restrictions at the time it was difficult to have a memorial service that they never did have a proper memorial service so they decided to combine the two so we were there and it was a good time and I thank God that we were able to go down and also I thank God for all of you who are able to travel there was quite a number that were able from the church to go down to support sister Donna and her family and I just want to say God bless you that was wonderful also yesterday the youth had a fun day and I saw a few pictures and it looks like they had some fun and so they had a fun day yesterday this is a fun weekend for them and then this afternoon they'll have a youth meeting but the cow be ministering his home again for them this afternoon and then tomorrow we'll have the Memorial Day picnic and so I hope to see you all there and so I just I appreciate the fellowship and I enjoy our time together and that'll be at brother Ben and sister Amanda siebolt's home tomorrow so there's a lot happening this weekend but praise God Amen we get to see each other more I like that not less but more also I wanted to let you know that on the weekend of June 10th and 11th I will be traveling to Edmonton Alberta Canada to preach for brother Eugene Braun I'll be doing weekend meetings there June 10th and 11th and while I'm gone brother Nathaniel sius will be ministering here so be praying for that brother Nathaniel and his family will come and join in here so as we go back to this subject that we've been looking on and Discerning true love part four I'd like to take as a subtitle when human love leads wrong when human love leads wrong and I want to look at some examples of that in the scripture and and we find that this is just where my mind has been what God's been dealing with me sometimes the greatest deception is the deception inside me sometimes the hardest discernment is the discernment of me because the scripture says man's heart is deceitfully wicked who can know it and and so we have The Human Side of us that we still deal with there's the human nature and there's a human love and an affection memory conscious reasoning and affection and all that and and you know we're always trying to discern the world around us and discern what's going on and we always want to do the right thing that's the children of God we have a desire to do the right thing but I find many times the the the the discernment that trips me up is when I fail to discern myself and so I like I told you before I I the one that I'm afraid of most is me because brother Venom said my greatest enemy is William Branham so my greatest enemy would be Chad Lamb and so I I think it's it's good when we recognize that and it puts us in a bit of desperation and Desperation is not a bad thing for the children of God Amen we try to avoid desperation but desperation drives us to Christ with a total dependency upon him and that by his Spirit he will guide us the right way because without his spirit I will go the wrong way [Music] so I need that so as we're looking at this let's go over to First John chapter four we read this scripture last time uh on Wednesday and I I just so enjoyed it I want to look at it again first John chapter 4 verse 7. I was telling Franco in the back this has been a busy weekend we had the Friday night we ministered at the the graduation yesterday we ministered at the memorial service then today and I said if brother bam said the congregation is 50 I said maybe today they need to be 60 or 65. so I could use a little bit of help today amen it's been busy but praise God my heart is full amen and I want to share what's on my heart so first John 4 7 beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love and this was manifest the love of God toward us because that God's sin has only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be a propitiation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US hereby know we that we that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us of his spirit this kind of love is only possible by his spirit by his spirit is the only thing that will give us the ability to love the way that the scriptures instruct us to in love human love won't accomplish this but the love of God will and so we see in verse 12 no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us he's saying nobody has seen God but if we love one another God dwelleth in us so you can see where God's dwelling and where God's acting out of by the love that the Brethren have one for another and so the the then God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us or his love is coming to fullness or completion in us this is the the this is the final stage of the final work of the manifestation of the revealing of the mystery of God and it's taking place in Bride form it's taking place in a mini membered body around the world where now that love that God has been displaying through time is now making a final display in the Gentile dispensation and it's it's coming to completion in US and he's saying if we love one another then then God dwelleth in us and we know that when we talk about the stature of a perfect man how we're growing into this image of Christ into the likeness of Christ into the stature of a perfect man growing in all things unto the head which is Christ that we will be the bride will be his reflection upon Earth uh sharing his character displaying his character in the Earth but it's going to take him doing it because we can't so that love is is coming perfect in us and as we as we go up the pyramid the brotherly kindness or Brotherly Love is just before amen the Capstone or the fullness of love and it's amazing that all of these attributes amen must be expressed in opposition to the attribute it makes sense faith is expressed in a world with no faith where unbelief is Faith is expressed so even at the base faith is expressed in the opposition to Faith brings the expression of faith the opposition of patience the impatience of the world Amen displays the patience of God the the lack of temperance the lack of self-control in society amen displays the the control of God the self-control the temperance of God so the all of these things are displayed in the opposition of the very thing that's be displayed amen so when we come into Satan's Eden where man's uh uh where love is gone grow man's love is waxed cold amen and and there's anything seemingly no more proper love no more even natural affection Amen in the opposition of love God will show pure love amen and so sometimes in order to show Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness there must be an opposition to brotherly kindness for the display of Brotherly kindness and we think that that uh you know we think that every trouble in the church and every trouble between Brethren amen is a terrible thing and it is a terrible thing if it goes unresolved but what it should do is bring out a greater love it should bring the manifestation of Brotherly kindness so when will I leave brotherly kindness when my brother needs the display of Brotherly kindness so these things are many times found in the opposition amen so when when things happen and things have to be dealt with and we have to talk with one another and we have to come back in Harmony and unity it's the perfect opportunity for the love of God to be displayed in US we shouldn't run away from those things but we should draw near to them amen and say God move me in the right way Amen to display brotherly kindness in this situation because I can see this situation is going to require a better greater love than human love amen so we can see that many times human love will lead us the wrong way and many times human love will lead us exactly contrary to God's love because many times God's love being expressed is a mystery to us and I want to look at that through the word it's very mysterious the way sometimes God expresses his love and and human Love Can can bring us into the direct opposition to the word of God brother Brown says in the message God projecting his love he says now love is in two different words two different meanings and the Greek one of them is called filio that's the love that you have for your wife Agape is the love divine love now the love that you have for your wife and the love of God Is So contrary that's amazing because the love that we have for our spouse is one of the strongest loves that humans experience but the love of God is even contrary to that it's even far superior to that that it that it acts sometimes contrary to that love he said just listen to this the love that you have for your wife if a man went and saw her you would kill him on the spot with that kind of love he says in another place that love will create jealousy well jealousy amen it that kind of jealousy that brings rage and hatred is wrong right that kind of he says that would kill him on the spot with that kind of love affiliate love but with Agape o love you'd pray for his lost soul that'd be the difference there's two different types of love and I'm almost sure that many of us has been deceived with having filial love and thinking it's agapio love that's the truth I can say it's the truth because it's been true in me many many times that I thought this was genuine love and it was love it was a form of love amen but it was a weaker form of love amen and when I find that sometimes that love was in contrast or working contrary to perfect love amen many times a man you know that when he talks about this uh filial love that would would cause a man to be enraged over the love of his wife and cause a man to kill a man on the spot amen we know that that's not the nature of Christ so that kind of love moved us away from Christ that kind of love though it's it's it's a real love that we have in the human emotion in the human side it's a real love amen that love moved us in contrast to the nature of Christ and that love this is an extreme example but that love in many other ways can move us in contrast to the nature of Christ so we we have to be careful that we we know God we know his word amen and we discern by the spirit of discernment by the spirit of Christ so we we know that many times these things would motivate us to do the wrong amen but the problem is when they come religiously and it's still a filial love but it's un and religious tones and can still move us contrary to the nature of Christ this kind of love though it looks like it's a love that's based on the love of another human being it's actually still has its Center focus in the love of self because you insulted my wife when you insulted my wife you insulted me you hurt my child when you hurt my child you hurt me so so this kind of love is that that drives this kind of bitterness and this kind of hatred and this kind of anger and that kind of love that drives that it looks like that you're loving your child or you're loving your wife or you're loving this or that but really when you get down to the core of it you're still loving self because somebody insulted your child not just a random child in the world but your child amen and when they offended your child they offended you and now amen instead of discerning this this rage it can bring a frustration range anger bitterness uh contempt it can bring all of these things that are contrary to the nature of Christ and we think it's Justified because that's my child that's my wife that's the one I love so much amen but that may be your child that may be your wife that may be this but the person who who maybe unintentionally caused the offense is your brother so can you slay your brother to protect your wife amen you see it gets down pretty tight and so brother bam also says for someone asked me not long ago isn't Satan a creator I said no sir God is the only Creator there is one Creator is gone he said well how did Evil ever get here then if Satan didn't create it I said evil is not a creation he said Satan cannot create but he can pervert what God has created brother bear says somewhere else evil is righteousness perverted he didn't create evil amen God never created evil amen but but the the devil Satan took righteousness and perverted it and when he took righteousness and perverted it it became evil amen he's not a Creator God is the creator but Satan perverts what God has created and God created good and Satan perverted it to evil and it's just like any other thing it's perverted it's wrong so God created love God's the originator of God is love but Satan can pervert love amen so he can take what God has made and he can pervert it amen brother Benham says in God hiding himself in Simplicity he says science is all right as far as it goes your five senses is fine and dandy as long as it agrees with the word but when the five senses condemn the word then get away from it he goes on to say in the greatest battle ever fought if you've got your senses see taste feel smell here they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word all right they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them now imaginations conscience memory reasoning and affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affections doesn't agree with the word get rid of it this word affections is another word for love it's another type of love amen if this if this affections doesn't agree with the word he says get rid of it and am I not supposed to be affection am I not supposed to have love absolutely the love of God Amen but if the love that you're feeling is moving you contrary to the word of God to the nature of Christ then get rid of that love that love is a motivation to go the wrong way that love somehow somewhere has been perverted by Satan himself to cause you to move away from the word not to the word amen uh I I hope as we move along amen you'll be able to that I I just hope that God will be able to take what he's put in my heart and put it in your heart because words are not sufficient there's no way amen I know what God has dealt with me on and I know what it means to me and I know how deep it's gone into my heart amen but I can't with words do that kind of deep heart surgery in anyone else it's going to take the working of the Holy Spirit to take what he's dealt in me in my heart amen and deal it with you in the same way so that it comes out correct not incorrect amen because uh one thing that always worries me so much in preaching amen is the human element that I can present something Amen in such a way by my own my own words my own way and cause somebody to misunderstand a little bit this way or a little bit that way and I so don't want to do that amen I want to yield myself to God so that he just speaks what he wants even if I don't comprehend it in my mind so that he can plant it in the heart and bring the correct understanding the right way I don't want to bring a misunderstanding I don't want to go I don't want to I don't want to inject myself amen and when you're a human being I mean how in the world do you avoid that preaching is tough but what I want is I want God to to work in our hearts to bring us into the image of Christ Paul says I travail again with you till Christ be formed in you what was Paul trying to get where was he trying to take the church he was trying to take to the church to the place where Christ is formed in you to where this great mystery would be revealed which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen I believe it's a deeper work for me it's a deeper work than I originally realized I thought I was going to understand a few doctrinal teachings and and I was going to understand what happened in the Garden of Eden and serpent C to understand the godhead and all that and then I'd kick out my TV and I stopped wearing shorts and I wouldn't say any bad language and wouldn't say any uh bad jokes and I I wouldn't and then I was going to be okay but I realized that's not okay that God actually wants to bring me into His Image God actually wants Christ he wants Christ to be manifest in me and it's going to take a complete death to self and a surrender of things I didn't even know I needed to surrender things that I had no understanding that were still roadblocks and still barriers deep within deep within the Flesh of John amen I thought I had surrendered all and I had surrendered all to the amount of all that I understood at the time I surrendered but then I found a little more that needed to be surrendered and then I found a little more that needed to be surrendered and that's why we keep coming back to church for the preaching of the word so that word can discern us and cut us amen and it can be a sharp two-edged sword that can defy the spirit and the soul and say this part is not what God wants this is the part that he wants amen and we can walk away I know for me when I look at these things I become overwhelmed sometimes and think God how am I going to manifest that amen but then I look at the hour we live in in the age that we're called to and the manifestation of the word that he's portrayed displayed in our day and I said what other hour what other generation what other people is going to make this new testament live it's in the word amen it must be lived it must be on display there must be a people that God will call to this manifestation and he will supply the means and the means is the word and faith in his word and now the spirit of the word will come on top of that and water the word and bring it to manifestation amen let's go to John chapter 11 together the Gospel of John chapter 11. let's just start looking at a few places in the word places we know places that are familiar but I just want to look at them once again John 11 and 1. now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore his sister sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God and the Son of God might be glorified thereby so immediately Jesus already knows the purpose of the sickness the purpose is not death even though we know that Lazarus is going to die in the flesh now look at verse 5 now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus Jesus loved them and when he had heard therefore that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was the part that becomes mysterious when humans look at it Jesus loved Martha and her sister in Lazarus and Those whom you love there's a notification that comes that says Lazarus is sick amen and Jesus delays two days instead of going to the one he loved because Jesus could raise him up Jesus could heal him he could cast off this sickness and deliver his friend who's Afflicted with sickness instead of moving amen the love of God had him stay and not go but human love doesn't comprehend this how can you allow a man to lay in agony and suffer in sickness when you can deliver him how can you stay here when you know he needs you what was holding him the love of God was holding him the human beings surrounding this didn't even comprehend this but this is a Higher Love then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into Judea again I'm sorry yeah when he heard these things that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was then after that he saith to disciples let us go into Judea again his disciples said to him Master the Jews of late sought to Stone thee and goest thou hither again Jesus answered are they not 12 are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he's stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbles because there is no light in him these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleep he shall do well I'll be it Jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest and sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there think about sometimes we have to stop and back away from the Bible for a second and think about Jesus heard he got notification in time to go to Lazarus to prevent lazar's death but he knew that there's a purpose in this so the love of God constrained him because there's a greater good remember the love of God is is is as a long foresight the love of God sees from the beginning to the end and knows what's best not what's convenient not what's easy but it always does what's best for the ones that it loves and so now he tells them lies are asleep and I go to wake him he knew what his purpose was he knew what he was supposed to do and I go wake him amen and then there they misunderstand that so he has to come out very plainly in the way they could understand and said Lazarus is dead and when it when they say Lazarus is dead he says and for your sakes for you because I love you for your sakes I'm glad I wasn't there but when you go to the flip side and you go to Bethany and you go to the home of Martha and Mary and Lazarus what were those two days like for them what was the passing of the brother like for them did they feel loved did they feel that the love of Jesus Christ was it a warm fuzzy feeling when they went and sent word but he didn't come I don't know why he didn't come maybe he's delayed maybe something's wrong if he would come this would be over amen and we know that they expressed that Faith because they said had you been here he would have lived so they've got questions they've got misunderstandings amen that they may have disappointments I don't know amen but they're real people with real emotions on the other side of Jesus delaying two days and telling his disciples for your sakes there's going to be something you need to see and you need to experience and God has allowed this for your benefit and this is the overall love of God and it may not felt loving to Martha and Mary but he was directed by God in verse 15 again I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go to him let's skip down to verse 32. then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died she knew that he would raise him she called for him and he did not come how many times have we called for him and it seemed like he didn't come we asked for an immediate deliverance and it didn't come immediately we asked for the situation to change and God allowed it to continue and we need to break away from human emotion to recognize the love of God because we can feel disappointed if we're really honest with ourselves we have felt disappointed in God we have felt neglected overlooked not cared about That's The Human Side those are the emotions that we go through we wanted a deliverance we wanted an answer we knew God could Martha knew that he could if you had been here he had not died I know that God could change the situation in my life and a fraction of a second everything could end he's got the power he has the ability there's no question in that and I know he loves me and I know he's able and I don't understand why he doesn't change it job was suffering through those kind of questions I'm righteous I don't know why he's allowing this to happen to me and we go through the whole emotional cycle sometimes of a trial when we sometimes have to back up and put this thing down amen and quiet it down and say it doesn't matter amen God knows what's best for me and I put my trust in him completely this is the love of God to me doesn't have to feel like it for me to recognize it [Music] so this true love sometimes so contrary to human love that it can be quite shocking sometimes remember we spoke a couple uh weeks ago about Jesus looking at Peter and he says this in Luke 22 verse 31 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when that are converted strengthened the brethren I can imagine if I think if I was Simon and Jesus told me that one of my reactions that I think now I may not think there in the moment when Jesus is speaking you might just keep quiet and say nothing but as I reflect on it now I'd say well God don't let him sift me as wheat couldn't you stop him but see Peter needed to be sifted as wheat Peter needed something inside of him to change he needed his own desperation and he tells Peter Satan hath desired to have you Satan hath desire to have you to sift you as wheat this whole language it lends itself to believe that he was seeking permission Satan has desired thee to Sifty his weed so he he's seeking permission to try Peter it was Simon at the time and or Peter and he's seeking permission and it appears to the context that he's granted permission and what is this this is love and we know what the sifting was like for Peter when he denied the Lord when he went out in great Agony amen after he denied and denied with cursings and went and wept bitterly amen none of that felt good for Peter none of that was emotionally warm and emotionally uh it wasn't warm feelings of love it wasn't euphoric it wasn't it you know what I mean it wasn't the cuddly I feel loved but it was the love of God bringing Peter to the position that Peter needs to be in because there's a love that has foresight there's a love that knows the end the beginning and there's a love amen that will not forego anything until it brings us into God's desired end for us that's why I've told people before I I've sat with many of you and we talked about difficult circumstances difficult trials in life and I've made the statement many times this is why God does not ask pastors for permission to put sheep in trials because pastors would always say oh no Lord don't don't do it please don't don't do that to their family don't don't let them go through that spare them Lord spare them Lord spare them Lord but that's why God never comes to the pastor and says hey is it all right no he just does it anyways amen because because in my heart I would say Lord no not not them not now don't no but God loves in a higher love where he won't spare anything to bring us to perfection we also spoke a little time back about the Apostle Paul when he was given a thorn in the flesh a messenger of the devil he says in second Corinthians 12 7 and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me Paul was given a little insight into his trial God had told him that I have done this for your welfare for your benefit and then he began to in glory in his infirmities and I I truly want to recognize in my life that the Lord does everything well the Lord does everything well his love for me never changes amen and and he he has foresight for me and vision and I don't want to let the human love in me interpret what's happening I want Divine love to interpret what's happening in my life I want to have a higher vision let's go to Mark chapter 10 together and look at another passage of scripture in Mark chapter 10 verse 17. this is the story of the Rich Young Ruler and when he was going forth into the way there came one running and kneeling to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is gone thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest I want to stop for just a second verse 21 in the beginning then Jesus beholding him loved him when Jesus loved him Jesus didn't say oh you're a good boy you're good everything's fine with you God loves you you're okay that's not what Jesus loved for this young man did but the love that he had for this young man would go to his very heart and root out the very problem the very need that he had to surrender in a greater way not keep covering for him and saying you're fine you're fine you're fine you can see how you know many times human love can lead us the wrong way and human love can be contrary to the will and love of God and even so much that that we as ministers or even mothers or fathers in the home amen we can we can cover for our children you're fine God loves you you're you're in our home you're one of my kids you're going to be okay no you're not okay until you surrendered all you're not okay until you've sold everything and given to the poor and taken up your cross and follow Jesus you're not okay because I say you're okay you're not okay because you're in my home you're not okay because you sit in this church you're only okay when you're okay and you're only okay when Jesus love has gone down and rooted the very problem that you have in your heart and gotten down to the thing that you need to surrender most and cause you to make a full surrender that's only when love is expressed but to constantly say oh you're you're fine you're wonderful you're great you're you're okay no and and then especially when in the home you can see there's problems here there's needs here there there's a there's a lack of surrender and I'm not going to keep telling myself you're saved you're a Christian you're they're only a Christian when they're born again by the spirit of God they're not a Christian because they live in my home they're not a Christian because I call them a Christian and they're not a Christian because they keep the rules of the house and you can see how the love and when you when you see even one of your children start to get uh uh uh a little anxious for their own salvation and and God begins to deal with them amen sometimes we want to take away all their anxiety we want to say Oh no you're it's okay it's okay no sometimes they need to go through the trouble sometime and amen of seeking out their salvation with fear and trembling sometimes they need to to actually find out for themselves where they stand and it might take a little tumultuous time where we don't need to say Amen you're okay you're fine don't worry about it but you might say no ask God until God reveals it to you you're going to be okay in the end but you may have to go through a rough time but keep seeking him till he settles it in your heart keep pressing till you surrender it all keep moving because if we're not careful we can take the very the very work that God is doing and sugarcoat it and take it away see how love can be contrary human love can lead the wrong way and be contrary to the love of God we can see error and wrong and sin and just smooth it over because we love that person and we don't want to say anything we don't want to is that love when Jesus looked at this young man he loved him and when he loved him he said there's one thing that you lack let's read it in verse 21 then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast give to the poor and thou shalt treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at the saying and went away grieve for he had great possessions sad that he turned his back on the opportunity he had but I say at least he had the opportunity at least he heard the truth and at least Jesus told him what compelled Jesus to speak to his heart it was his love the young man says he says what must I do to inherit eternal life he says you know the Commandments don't I don't commit adultery don't steal you honor thy father money said I've done these for my youth and Jesus didn't say okay you're fine he went deeper so there's one thing that you're lacking you have to sell out yourself completely and give yourself completely to me you have to sell all of your possessions give it to the poor that means surrender your entire life give it away take up your cross which is an instrument of death and follow me that's what love spoke to the Rich Young Ruler that's what true love spoke to the original ruler let's go to John chapter 5. John chapter 5 verse 2. now there is a Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches and these leg a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 and eight years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him will thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another stepping down before me Jesus saith in him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath brother Ben refers to the scripture many many times and he refers to the fact and draws our attention to the fact that there was multitudes of sick lame blind withered laying around this pool and although there was a great multitude Jesus went to one and this is what he says and I'm going to read from a couple places but in the message earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he says now watch just a little further if you will one day he was going down to a pool called Bethesda and the Bible said great multitudes of impotent folk laid there watch what kind of people lame blind withered waiting for the moving of the water we're in Saint John 5 now great multitudes many times is what there's tonight maybe 10 times what's here they were all lame withered blind waiting for the moving or the water and just a few days after that woman touched His Garment there he came right down through that same pool walked by the blind walked by the lame he was full of compassion yes well why didn't he have compassion you mean to tell me the merciful Christ the anointed Emmanuel walking among lame halt withered and blind and never healed them now watch hold that in your mind sometimes you don't know what compassion means friend the people are so bound they don't understand Heavenly things we don't see compassion is to do the will of God not sympathy there's a lot of difference between sympathy and compassion now watch him just like love love comes in two categories we know what the two Greek words agapio and philio the filio love is Earthly like friendship agapio love is above just listen to this philia love is what you have for your wife your children that's filio now if someone insult your wife a Kind of Love would make you kill them the man insult your wife that's filio but agape love would make you pray for his lost soul that's the difference that's the way with human compassion and godly compassion compassion in the Realms of spirit means to do the will of him that sent you says there's a difference between sympathy and compassion and I started looking I looked it up just to see and and relate it to what brother Branham was saying sympathy is to feel sorry for somebody to have pity to feel sorry for somebody but compassion is to feel sorry for somebody with the desire to help okay now there can be a false compassion that comes with sympathy but there's a Godly compassion and a Godly compassion knows that the only way that I can help this person is by the word of God Amen there's this only thing is to give them the word of God because there's nothing else I can do to help them you think about uh brother Graham says it and sirs we would see Jesus there's two different types of compassion one of them is human sympathy the other one is Godly compassion Godly compassion is to do the will of God human sympathy throws everything into a puddle human sympathy messes everything up and if we could just relate it to uh something very practical in the word we know that God has promised us if we pay tithes if we pay tithes that he promised the blessing that we can't contain and he'll prevent the Devourer from devouring we know that is that the promise but sometimes we see brothers or sisters they get into some difficulty some hardship maybe a financial situation amen and we may not realize that the Devourer has come because God has allowed it because they're not faithful in their tithes and we were Symphony one sympathy want to relieve the pressure on our brother and sister and so we keep funneling money and funneling money and funneling money because that's what we should do as loving people right we should not let anybody suffer amen we should take away all suffering we have means to take away all suffering but the problem is amen they're out of the will of God out of the word of God and all of my human compassion is never going to fix this problem there's an empty well that money will not fix because the problem is a spiritual problem they're off the word and I need to talk to them enough to realize Hey listen I think I understand what's going on Amen have you been paying your time well no I I got a little behind and I'm this and that and the other and and and and you know there's always a reason but there's never a good reason and so I could say oh yeah it's all right we understand and this and that and let me help out listen that's not help that's not love is to say listen brother sister I love you listen but the problem that I see is you're not lined up to the word if you get lined up to the word God has promised a blessing and I don't have the power within myself to override God's word and if I attempt to now my love oh I hope you understand now my love is evil now my love is wrong I'm in error I'm contrary to the word because of human compassion that doesn't mean we don't help people out my goodness we help people all the time we want to help people but but and there's times that there's help needed there's scriptures for that but oh God help us to help the right way help us to be loving help us to love our brothers the way God loved the Rich Young Ruler the way Jesus Christ loved him help us to love one another that would help us to have true genuine love of God in our hearts and not feel like that not feel like because we keep doing things that we're good we keep relieving pressures we keep handing out that listen we may be going absolutely contrary to the word of God in that amen we need some discernment we need God to lead us by spiritual leadership and maybe we need to ask some questions sometimes and give real love because real love true love will always bring us back to the word because true correction will always bring us back to the word and true love is corrective men we thought I thought I shouldn't say we I don't want to include you in my error I thought coming to perfection coming into the statute of Christ would be so much easier I didn't realize it was going to cost me everything to lose all of self to surrender completely and to continue surrendering completely not a one-time surrender but a daily dying Paul says I Die daily and looking for Jesus in 1954 he says then when he was found in the temple rejoicing the Jews questioned him now this is Saint John the fifth Chapter 19 Verse listen closely I questioned well why didn't he heal all those people we're still to pull the Bethesda if he was a great healer why didn't he make all those crippled people he passed right through them if he was full of love why didn't he have compassion on them people don't know what compassion is compassion and love is the will of God and you can this this is the statement us all stop pinch ourselves said that one time I want to use it pinch ourselves put on our spiritual jackets whatever we have to do but pay close attention to this next statement to me it hinges all on this compassion and love is the will of God and you can only exercise that as God gives it not human emotional passion non-emotional love but Divine love which can only be rendered and given by God this is not listen friends I hope that you never walk away from the series we've been preaching thinking I have to try harder it's trying harder is not going to do this we have to become more desperate more dependent more sincere and say God if without you I will fail in perfect love without your spirit taking control of me amen you've got to highlight the areas in me that I have to die to you have to expose the hindrances the roadblocks whatever's plugging up your channel you've got to show it to me amen so that I can surrender that to you so that you can flow through me because I can't do it and if anything that God has been doing in my heart over the last couple months amen when I've been looking in this subject is realizing that this is an impossibility it comes down to a hair's breath of separation between what is God and what is me what is right what is wrong amen and it's going to take the word of God to come and separate the spirit and the soul but it's going to take a revelation of that word because I can read scriptures all day long and still walk away confused Within Myself with which is me and which is gone may God take the foolishness of preaching and may God use that to root out all the hindrances from our life may God himself begin to expose and begin to show so that we can be what he's called us to be in this hour so it can this can only exercise as God gives this is sovereignly given we can talk about we we can talk about so many things out of the Bible there's more things that we'll begin to talk about and we can talk about uh um like uh the Rich Young Ruler he did so many things we would say okay he loves God but Jesus saw something else and went for it we can talk about you know those who love God and they act like it but it really they had self-love mixed in and it didn't go and you can say how was I ever as a human being going to sort all of this out how am I going to discern when to act and when not to act How will I know when I should do something and when I shouldn't do something I tell you Francis getting down to the place where he is going to have to have preeminence which is the second fold of his threefold plan which happens to be the fold that is unfolding right now in human beings on the Earth where he gets preeminence in a body of Believers and he's doing that now in the bride oh brother Chad am I going to know whether God wants me to do this or doesn't want me to do this amen I judge it by the word but I don't know the heart of the person I don't know what God's trying to do in their life I don't know what the end is I don't know how to handle the situation I tell you I never know how to handle situations if it's not clear in the word you don't know what to do amen this is where God is going to have to have preeminence in the body that is the hour that we live in amen and we've got to keep surrendering to him and quit acting like we know everything we don't know anything we quit acting like we know how to handle situations we know how to deal with this and I can deal with that and I can deal with that and I can judge that no listen God knew amen G God has revealed to Jesus Christ by the father he knew not to go to Lazarus but hey maybe you should go to Lazarus when you first heal he's sick maybe you should raise him up maybe you should wait how do I know when to raise him up how do I know when to wait how do I know when to pray how would I know not to pray this is real this is the reality brother I'm going to say a few other statements he's going to bring this more real and the message the God of this evil age said his notice the tree that Satan caused Eve to partake of was the tree of Good and Evil it was a mixed tree now look at the day we're living in when he's calling out a bride he's got a church that claims to be doing good this is Satan's church you've got a church that claims to be doing good when it's evil by denying the word claims to be doing good saving people ministering to the Lost helping the needy but brother bear says when it's evil by denying the word not that though the works are horrible not that it's bad to do those nice things that is fine there's nothing wrong with that but when you deny the word and don't bring the word to the people amen and tell them that they're fine amen so far but hold back the word amen that has become now evil all the good works have accomplished nothing but evil because of denying the word amen we spoke about this last time in second Thessalonians chapter three oh no we didn't I'm just going to read this quickly to you but it goes into the context of church discipline and in this scripture Paul says if there if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed yet him count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother Paul's telling them listen if somebody will not obey our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with them now that does not look like human love does it does that look like a loving Church I mean in the Modern laodicean Standard of loving Church to not have Fellowship not keep company why Paul says if they don't obey my word of this epistle my word Mark that one and keep no company with that man that he may be ashamed yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother this isn't retribution this isn't bitterness this is a hatred this is an act of love this is not my enemy this is my brother but he needs to come in obedience to the word and my covering for him making excuses for him will never help him it will only hurt him that's not love we we spoke about church discipline and brother Brandon makes this statement that's what's the matter with the churches today when a man comes into the body of Christ and becomes one of the members and starts doing evil instead of you all getting together and doing this very same thing and you Branham Tabernacle do that because as long as you're holding him up he's under the blood and you and he just keeps doing the same old thing over and over and over all the time you get together turn him over to the devil for the destruction of the flesh that is Spirit like might be saved in the day of the Lord and watch the whip of God come in watch The Devil take hold of him that's an evil spirit gets him and this boy here straightened out he come back we find out in second Corinthians where he really cleaned up before God he goes right into the discipline that Paul teaches and into the reconciliation because the purpose of discipline was reconciliation the purpose of discipline was love and salvation but but he says if you cover for them you keep him here under the blood and the two things are happening he's contaminating the church and he's also going on thinking he's all right when he's not all right that's not love so it's difficult I tell you sometimes we meet difficult situations these things are taxing I I'll say this they're taxing on the human emotional Realm you you I've had to I've had to deal in these situations as a pastor and and I tell you I never understood what it meant until I'm in this position I never knew what it meant to have a Watchman at the gate and a Watchman on the wall and I never knew what that meant but I tell you when you when you talk to people that you love that you genuinely love that you like and you want to fellowship with but you know there's an unreconciled situation and and they want to come I've got people who want to come want to be part of the assembly love the word love the ministry they want to come amen but they're under church discipline somewhere else and I said you can't come here you can't sit Among Us you can't partake with us amen because there's an unreconciled situation that has to be settled before you come here we can't take you in and cover for you amen if the sin is not taken care of if it's taken care of go and reconciled and then come back but that sounds easy to do but when you get down to it amen it tears your heart out it twists you in the knot you second guess yourself you wonder is this right is this loving am I doing the right thing and you have to make very very hard decisions and make very difficult conversations amen but you're compelled by the love of God because you know that only the word of God will work in the end nothing else will work no matter how I feel about this situation I feel like I don't want to have this conversation I feel like I don't want to tell you no I love you and I want you to come but regardless of how I feel about the situation it will never work out to your benefit until we stay with the word [Music] and that is love but in a human realm it doesn't look like love it looks how can you turn somebody away how can you they they want to have Fellowship they want to be amongst the brother they want to do that how can you what else can we do and display the love of Christ how else can we show love tell your friends it's not easy these things are not easy I mean we can just if I can just open my heart it's so easy you can preach things like this and a way to work people in a frenzy we won't allow any sin in here we'll cut it out and you're not coming here everybody's amen hallelujah but when it gets down on the human level and you're looking somebody in the eye and you love them and you have to tell them that's wrong brother by the word sister that's wrong that can't be permitted that can't be allowed it won't do you good it won't do the people good listen you you can work people into a frenzy and we can get all excited about we won't let sin in the doors and we want this and we'll stand with the word but when it comes down to the human element something in you is going to have to die stay with the word something within you is going to have to surrender to love God and to really love your brother the love of God is not easy it's rugged it's tough it's true in every circumstance and human love has to die so that the love of God can live it's amazing how some things are easy to read hard to live easy to say hard to do and the reality is not in the saying the reality is in the doing the reality is not in the preaching or even the saying the amen to the preaching the reality is when it becomes manifest and flesh and we become tested from those things and the message who is this Brother Bear preaches and what if somebody sinned maybe they do something they ought not to have done maybe they ought to have done something they did not do or something on that manner and here they are God permitting Satan to hold that curse on them to bring them to something to obedience sicknesses sometimes is a whip God is using to bring obedience and what if that person standing there says oh Hallelujah glory to God praise God anoint them with oil pray over them and happen to cast that evil spirit off of them and God permitted it to be put on there I'm in trouble right then with God so what brother Brown says if God permitted that spirit because somebody's off the word they're disobedient in some way and God is trying to bring them because of his love back into obedience and permit an evil spirit to afflict them maybe sickness or something common brother but I'm talking about he takes it up and if I was able to take that off and God permitted it I would be in trouble with God that's why I said when it when it gets down to this level you can say how in the world am I as a human being going to do this amen it's going to take something Beyond me I need God every day of my life I need the spirit of God I've got to stay surrendered this is why a half-hearted Christian life is not going to get it it's going to take a total sold out complete surrender daily walk with the Lord because I can't just do Sunday and Wednesday and ever come into the image of Christ it's not going to happen this is far beyond that amen this is God coming down and building and building and building and US emptying and him growing within us praise God let's go to Matthew chapter 16 now Matthew chapter 16. verse 21. from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from the Lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art and offense unto me for thou savorest not the things that be of God but those things that be of men you have to ask yourself what what made Peter rebuke the Lord we know Peter loved the Lord because after the resurrection Jesus comes to Peter and three times he asks him does thou love his name Peter and Peter says yes Lord I love you Peter loved the Lord he had affection for him and Peter did not want this thing to happen to Jesus and when Jesus starts speaking the truth the word of God the plan of God Amen the great love of God that was going to be expressed in crucifixion amen he begins to express that there's going to go to Jerusalem going to suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again on the third day all Peter could think was no my Lord this isn't going to happen to you no way can we let this happen and Jesus turns around and says get thee behind me Satan and brother man says he wasn't speaking to Peter but Peter was being influenced by an evil spirit and Peter's words were expressing an evil to desire and what was that evil desire the evil desire was to stop the manifestation of the word of God and to stop the love of God from being expressed why because Peter didn't want that to happen man and was Peter wrong for loving Jesus was Peter long for having affection for him was Peter wrong for wanting him to stay no he wasn't wrong but where he was wrong is when he denied the words that were coming out of his mouth and had another plan and tried to stop the word of God from coming forth and we know that Jesus was delivered by the determinate Council and foreknowledge of God this was God's plan from the beginning and Peter is now contradicting the word because he's influenced by an evil spirit because of his human love say God help us now we find Peter although he was rebuked and although the devil was rebuked Peter never really changes his mind if we go over to John chapter 18. we'll see that he stays in the same frame of mind John chapter 18. verse 10. then Simon Peter having a sword drew it and smote the high priest servant and cut off his right ear and the servant's name was malcus then said Jesus unto Peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall I not drink it Peter listen Peter is there what was Marcus doing what was what was uh he coming he was coming with a band a guard to come and arrest Jesus and Peter didn't want Jesus to be arrested and Peter wanted to defend Jesus and Peter took out a sword and the love that Peter had for Jesus he was willing to kill a man because that's what he was attempting to do and I've heard somebody say before and it struck me as absolutely true I don't think he was trying to cut off his ear I think he was trying to split his skull cut off his head he was trying to kill the man what was motivating him to kill love what kind of love wrong love because the love of God was surrendering to the will of God Amen and Jesus had the love of God surrendering to the will of God Amen to allow the word of God to come into manifestation that was pure love to hinder that was wrong and now Peter's wrong and and he was so brave one minute but then when the question comes to him by a damsel he becomes so terrified showing that human love is so insufficient to carry out the word of God because human love still holds self as the center of affection it was Peter who didn't want his Lord to die Peter listen Peter didn't want anything to change Peter didn't want Jesus he wanted the ministry to continue on his position with Jesus to continue his friendship Is Love Peter wanted it to stay amen so Peter loved Peter and then when Peter got to the to the outer Court there warming him by a fire in the damsel begin to ask him you're not one of them Peter still loved Peter because he denied the Lord the very one he loved so much he would kill a man for now he's denying that very one showing you how weak human love is that's why I can't be relied upon it must be surrendered human love is only good if it lies with the word of God any other way we get rid of it and so we see now if if I could take another step because of this human love that Peter has for the ministry for the Lord for the work that's going on first church and let's say first church and first pastor can I say that because of that when somebody comes to disrupt that he's willing to take a sword and kill that man to protect what he loves brother Brandon said this in Hebrews chapter 7 part 2 be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right not just go around and tear tear down you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor say something bad about him you just might as well shot him told something that wasn't right about him well it's it'll kill his influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of it there's more than one way to kill a man we may not do like Peter did and run out with a sword amen but he says if you killed his influence you speak something against him amen you might as well put a knife in his back and how many times in you who have been around a while have seen how many times because of the love for my church love or we could say like this my love for the message when somebody comes against it I'm willing to kill that man well I no you you gave him a piece of your mind you told him he was all this that and the other and told everybody else what he was too amen what was Marcus there doing fulfilling the word of God now it's not the part I would want to fulfill I wouldn't want Marcus's part but Marcus was there fulfilling the word of God he was there by the determinate Council and foreknowledge of God he was there to arrest Jesus to bring him further on in the revelation of the word and Jesus never railed against them never but but occupations against him Jesus surrendered and so it was such an example for us amen my love listen my love for God cannot produce evil actions if my actions are evil my love was human but I thought it was Godly love who thought it was my love of God and it was a love for God but it was still a self-centered love for God because when somebody attacked the message they offended me and in the offense to me I lashed out at them that wasn't defending the message that was defending yourself that was the result of human love and and as I look at this listen I have prayed and I have confessed and I have asked God to forgive me because I am guilty of this I'm guilty of this I'm guilty of the wrong love bringing the wrong motivation and taking the wrong action I'm guilty of lashing out I'm guilty of saying things I should I have remorse in my heart because I have done this very thing this isn't this isn't a just a a concept this is reality and I've lived the reality on the wrong side not realizing you know when brother Branham when he was speaking to Lee Veo and levale says how do you let people talk against you so how can you let this man say this and that and brother bear said maybe the Lord let him say that he said remember what David when David was going out a cast out a king a rejected King his son was taking the throne and he was leaving Jerusalem and that man was spitting on him and the son in his in his one of his captains of his guard said I'll let the head stay on that dog to Spitz on my king and David said leave him alone the Lord told him to do that brother Ben was having this discussion amen with Lee Veil and as he discusses this with levale in the Blue Boar Restaurant amen they go home and when he goes home and his wife's picking up a conversation they had before about whether they should go back to Arizona or stay in in Jeffersonville and she goes I know God called you out there but does he want us to stay out there and there was this question and then somebody made a statement oh this tax man and this that and said something bad about the tax man who's having the tax case against brother Brandon and brother bear said without me even thinking about what I said to leave he said I said maybe the Lord told him to do that said as soon as I did letters flashed on the wall said come on back to Arizona you think God wasn't pleased with the Son of God passing that test he didn't rail back he recognized if God allows somebody to persecute you Me Maybe I need to be persecuted if God permits it if somebody's lambasting my name if somebody's speaking false accusations Against Me Maybe that's what I need because all things work together for good to them who are the called according to his purpose so even the negative things will work together for good God will God will use this listen when when when Paul the apostles was was walking amen through the Greek Countryside and he was in a city and there was this witch following after him and she was crying out amen these men of God these men of God Amen it was troubling his Spirit every day but he couldn't say anything to her until God gave him permission and at some point God gave permission and he rebuked the spirit in her and it went out and and brother Branham said that he God didn't give him permission because he needed the advertisement maybe you need the advertisement maybe your name needs to become a household name in a negative way because you need the advertisement so that God can turn it for good I'm telling you the hardest one to discern itself I look back now and looking back retrospectively I can see that wasn't God that was Chad Lamb it wasn't God that was me I it wasn't the anger of God in Me and I have to be honest I wasn't defending his word I was defending myself I don't think we're ever going to go up till we get honest can't grow up until there's true humility and we recognize so many things that we thought were Godly we're just human so many things we thought were right we're motivated by the wrong thing the love of God is so much higher than human love it's so different than human love amen that we have to surrender our own feelings and own emotions and lay them down amen and also the love of God is not quick the love of God is Not uh irrational the love of God the love of God is steady stable it's been determined before the foundation of the world it's not reacting all the time that instant reaction and movement that's human love but the love of God has been placed over time and is a constant steadfast unmovable Force doesn't have to react to criticism and doesn't have to react falsely it doesn't it doesn't get bothered it doesn't get flustered it doesn't get its feathers ruffled it already knows the end from the beginning I want to move into the love of God with all of my heart so love when we start looking at this way love is very deceptive I hope I can say that and know that I'm speaking of human love not God's love not Agape but love is very deceptive because it feels so much like I love God and it feels so much like I'm defending God and it feels so much like I I'm doing this for righteous reasons Amen in that love masks the actual Pride that's in my heart that's causing me to lash out so love is very deceptive amen but the word of God is a discerner are the thoughts and intents of the heart when we begin to see these things we begin to recognize that in the past there's been many attempts to defend a church to defend a Ministry to defend a Doctrine and in those attempts many individuals have taken swords I happen to be one of them have taken swords and wasn't trying to cut off someone's ear I'll tell you was trying to kill that thing that was coming against what I felt like I loved I recognize now that's not what God has called me to not here God doesn't need me to defend him and God doesn't need me to defend the message my goodness the message is what's defending me [Music] that God doesn't need my sword that's why I looked at Peter and said Peter put your sword in the sheath this cup that my father has given me shall I not drink it this is the will of God man we don't need to go to battle just to defend our own offenses just to defend what we love we must just stay true to the word and let God anoint us when to speak and when to be quiet not let our emotions anoint us I have so many things that I said In the Heat of the Moment that I regret for the rest of my life I want to be motivated by not motion I want to be motivated by the spirit of God I want to look at this one more thing here before we part today and I want to look at the story of Florence shakarian you know Florence shakarian was a sister to demon Shakira and Demas was a good friend brother Bram was friends with the entire family and Florence passed away in 1965 and brother Branham predicted that she was going to pass away and in this quote he tells the story out of God's power to transform from September 11 1965. so good morning friends he said this of the shakarian family brother Williams and Sister Williams and many of them here know about it I saw that in a vision about two or three years before she got sick and it happened and last year when we were here I believe it was in January at the convention it was the time that the priest what's his name I forgot his name was here Stanley Stanley Bishop Stanley from the Catholic Church you remember when he brought me the Bible you know and he said to me it was several prophesying my daughter you are healed so sometime before when brother Brandon was was preaching birth pains and he has this new Bible and the pages are stuck together and we know that whole how that all the story transpired and that Catholic bishop comes and brings him his Bible said read it out of my book say steady son the Lord is fixing to do something and he preached his birthday he opens the scripture and later he finds out two pages were stuck together and he comes back and preaches this day this scripture is fulfilled it was at that time but during that service Florence shakarian had got up and she had sung a sung a song special and it was beautiful apparently she was a wonderful singer and people began to prophesy because they knew that she was sick and she had a a bad sickness a terminal sickness I believe it was and they began to prophesy and they begin to say my daughter you're healed they were saying daughter of God you'll not die but you'll sing again there was prophecies going forth in that and I believe it's Billy Paul tells more of this in his testimony how he got out later and he was bothered by that because he knew his dad said he saw a vision of her passing away but here they are she sings a special the anointing Falls of tongues and interpretations of Prophecy that daughter you'll not die but you'll live and Billy Paul was troubled about it and and later his dad could tell he was troubled he said what's troubling you son and he said uh well that they were prophesying in there he said what about it they were saying that she'll not die she'll live he said yes he said but you said he said brother Billy I don't know or he said Billy I don't know he said all I know is God told me she's going to go and she's gonna go and here it is in September 65 and they're talking about the passing of Florence shakarian and what about all those prophecies that were anointed during the service she sang and it felt so good I believe they loved Florence I wonder what motivated the prophecy because it wasn't a true prophecy but it must have felt good it must have felt right it must have seemed right to say that you see how dangerous human love is he said it was several prophesying my daughter you're healed and he knew that the vision had said he's talking again about Bishop Stanley he knew the division had said that she would not get well she would die between two and three o'clock in the morning remember that so two or three o'clock and I I couldn't tell Demas and yet I told her stepmother right over in the room right across the place here I said she isn't going to get well and Mr Karen said well everybody is prophesying I said course listen to brother Brandon I love this character I said course I could be wrong myself but I said she isn't going to get well he knew what the vision said he was just being gentle with his stepmother said I told many of them about three years ago I saw her running for her life and she went into a bed and she raised up her hands and screamed to me like that and I couldn't even reach her and then I seen her die and I looked and there was something there was a clock and it said it's between two and three o'clock and so the bishop said well I'll just watch and see how that comes to pass so it did come to pass we are certainly sorry I feel the church has lost a great person and sister Florence shakarian but she was a great singer she was a Spirit-filled woman you want to talk about confusion brother Branham season of vision a prophet of God sees and a vision that she's not going to live she's going to die between two and three but in the emotion of Florence sick as she was standing up and singing such a beautiful special it must have been moving I'm just guessing but it must have been moving so much so that people with gifts begin to operate and begin to prophesy and prophesy and her stepmother said everyone's prophesying it was more than one prophecy there was a collaboration let's say or a confirmation and it's amazing that in the atmosphere with the love towards Florence in the uh emotional whatever it was of seeing her sing and knowing she was sick and everybody praying amen there were people who began to prophesy you'll not die daughter but you'll live and begin to prophesy and the family was hearing the prophecy it was troubling brother Billy but that prophecy was false it did not come from the spirit of God this is why this is why I'm saying I'm telling you with all my heart I know if God does not help us we will not be helped if God does not save us we will not be saved if God by his Spirit does not control us amen we will destroy ourselves oh God we need God we need God more than anything else in this life we need him more than breath more than food more than housing we need the spirit of God to lead us we need to empty out so that we can fill out more we need more cut out of us we don't need more of self we need less of self self is destructive but we need the love of God should have brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost what false hope to a family and I I wasn't there but I can only imagine because I've been in services I can only imagine the tears The Joy the rejoicing all because of human emotion God help us we can't do this on our own this is only God LED but I thank God that God had a plan before the foundation of the world and that plan had a threefold purpose and the second fold of that three-fold purpose was for him to get preeminence and a body of Believers and preeminence means full control and I'm so glad that is his purpose before the foundation of the world because my purpose isn't enough and my desire isn't enough it must be his purpose and he will accomplish his purpose I see God take more of me take more of me help me to die a greater death to self I am the problem but he is the solution when the word came back in this day the full measure of the Holy Ghost came back and the more I received the word I received the life of the word and the more I empty out and the more I open up and the more I receive and acknowledge that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth I I'm receiving the word that changes me from Glory unto Glory and I said God keep changing me brother Branham he has another story I'd like to just go in this another story and then we'll close he's got a a young lady who brings him a dream and is after him for the interpretation of the dream and the message influence he says now a little girl came to me the other day she may be sitting present now said brother Benham I gave you a dream and in this dream I had a certain thing I want you to tell me I sat down now if there is any out in here outside of Pentecostal Realms let me excuse myself to you a moment and he said you he said you never and she said you never told me my dream she he never gave her the interpretation so she went to Brother bam knowing he's a prophet gave her a dream and she now wants the interpretation of her dream I said honey sit down just a minute and I said your father and mother are very good friends of mine retired farmers who come from a long ways to sojourn with us and I said they believed me as a servant of Christ you're just a child about 12 years old I think she goes to school with my Becky and I said look you're going to meet a lot of things out here honey in the name of Christianity I said when you find a man that's got every interpretation just like this he snaps his fingers just like that in the name of the Lord I said you be careful about that that's contrary to the scripture Jesus said there was many lepers in the Days of Elijah but only one was sent to him one many widows in the days of Elisha but only one was sent to him many things that Jesus did not do many times those gimmicks that's got every answer be careful when somebody stands up and speaks in the name of the Lord that must be true it must be exactly the truth you might in your mind be impressed I said now honey I believe I could tell you what I think your dream is but to tell you in the name of the Lord no sir brother Branham even felt like he might he he might know what that means but he wasn't going to tell her look what I just just follow along with me and I'll read that again now honey I believe I could tell you what you what I think your dream is but to tell you in the name of the Lord no sir because she she knows the things I said I have ever spoke to you in the name of the Lord but what had happened I said thousands has come and said this that I said I cannot tell you what your dream is till I see it over again and then he tells me then I can say the Lord told me until then I don't know I don't want to take my influence and my opinion I can't say thus saith the Lord because that's me thinking it that's best to my opinion we must be sincere because we've got the greatest thing in the world the greatest Treasure of Heaven is Christ Among Us why do we want to substitute some little influence to try to make ourselves somebody big among somebody here why not be a humble servant to Christ you know what I think I think he loved her enough not to tell her what he thought about her dream sometimes I've been frightened at things people will say as if they know somebody will share a dream oh that means that how do you know that means that and what if the influence you have as a brother or sister when somebody starts to tell you say oh no that's that and that's that remember brother Benham said white this and you know white horse is this and that and so we can tell by that this means this my goodness what if you and they trust you and they believe that you have spiritual insight and they take what you said and they go with it and why would you do that anyways if you didn't know for sure if you didn't have thus Faith the Lord if you didn't see the dream and you didn't know for sure why would you do that because you want to look spiritual and you want to have the answer and you want to know something a greater love will say listen brother sister I don't really know I don't know God hasn't given me that gift if God wants me to interpret he'll have to show it to me I'll see the dream he'll tell me until then I can't I can't tell you I don't know we'll just pray that God will bring it to pass or God will reveal it some way but I don't know see to me that's real Godly love that's genuine love not playing games with people spiritually do we understand real love they say you know what I don't have that gift I can't tell you I don't know God hasn't shown me I don't want to lead you wrong I don't want to act like I know what your solution to your problem is I don't want to act like I know if you do x y z it'll be all right I don't know if you do x y z it'll be okay all I can do is point you to the word that's all I can do all I can do as a brother is tell you I I don't really I can't tell you what you should do I can't tell you you should do this or do that but this is what I see in the Bible and I see the scripture and I'll give you the scripture and it looks to me like this fit but go pray about it and see how God leads you you know it looks like we're loving I'll I'll tell them and I'll help them and that's if listen if that's coming from your own understanding and your own opinion and your own thoughts and you begin to share it as if it's from the Lord that's not love but I want to help that's not helpful what's helpful is to be honest to be truthful and say I really don't know but I will pray with you that God will give you an answer to your question or God will show you out of the word or God will bring it over the pulpit or Sunday or God will have somebody hit you with an answer and it'll come from the word and you'll hear a tape or or you'll be in a service or you'll read your Bible and God will give you the answer I'm praying that you get your answer but I'm not the source of your answer he's the source of your answer the same reason people are motivated to do those things is the same reason Peter wanted to cut Marcus's head off self and oh I want to die to self I want to die to self I I haven't arrived yet to the place that I want to be but I want to be more surrendered than I am now I want to be more consecrated than I am now I want to I want more of the love of God I I want less of me I don't want me I want him living in me I don't want to be muddled up with false love and human love and and mixing it up with the love of God I just want the love of God to take control I want it to be Earnest I wanted to be sincere I want it to be real I want it to be genuine in every way I want it to be him and not me and I want him to get all the credit and me to get none because if I do something that allows me to share in the credit then I will inject self again and I will destroy the very thing that I'm hoping he will accomplish in me so there's anything that I can inject so that I can get partial credit that's the part that will ruin the whole thing that'll be the hair in the biscuit the part that I can get credit for but more than anything I want him to take his preeminence I want him to express his love I don't want my love to move an error I don't want my love to become evil because I'm standing against the will or word of God because of my emotions about a situation I want to take a step back and say God I don't know what you want done but I believe your word says and I would like to see this word made manifest amen sometimes love is not praying that someone will be healed but praying that they'll be restored and then healed there's sometimes when I I have insight and I know the situation and somebody asked a prayer request and I cannot pray what they're asking me to pray because my heart won't allow me but what I can pray is God I pray you turn the light on so they can see the air so that they can repent and can be completely delivered of this affliction what I want to pray is not what's easier convenient what I want what I need to pray is what's really loving what's genuine love amen if we go and fix everybody's problems when God wants them to have problems when God's using the problems to bring about circumstances so there's a repentance and a restoration and sometimes what he wants us to do is leave things alone and let him finish his work How will I know when and how will I not I can't give you the answer all I know is let's get dependent on him and say God by your spirit you must move me according to your word I it must be by Perfect faith not by me amen I'd like to just finish by reading First Corinthians 13. if we could just read this together First Corinthians 13. verse 1. though I speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity I become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol this charity is what we've been talking about for the last four services this love true love genuine love agape love the love of God and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love I am nothing that verse weighs heavy on me more so than it did a month ago and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profited me nothing charity suffereth long these are the attributes of Charity charity suffereth long in his kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself it is not puffed up amen so charity is not jealous of anybody else does not envy anybody else's gift anybody else's position in the church anybody else's family any gift or reward that God has given to anybody charity does not is not jealous of that because charity knows that's God and what God's given me is God's love for me and what's God's given them is God's love for them charity font is not itself doesn't put itself on a pedestal doesn't lift itself up doesn't promote itself it's not puffed up it's not proud does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own so that means she's not looking for her own welfare this is not human love this is pure love not seeking for herself but for others amen is not easily provoked thinketh no evil Rejoice is not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never faileth what is the peak of the stature of a perfect man what is the Capstone what is the headship of Christ uniting with the bride it is this perfect love and I thank God we live in the generation for this manifestation am I where I want to be no and where I used to be no thank God but I believe that God has more for us to manifest I believe that great manifestations will all be by the love of God though I can speak with tongue of men and angels and have not loved I become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol though I I have all Faith to move mountains listen that is pretty move a mountain by that Faith but I'm not charity I've become nothing but I know all Mysteries and I have no knowledge and have not this love it profit me nothing what do I need above everything I need the love of God should have brought in My Heart by the Holy Ghost I needed to grow until it takes full control of my being amen let's all stand musicians if you'll come and Blake if you'll come and you know brothers and sisters I love you with all my heart you know and I I never intend to preach to be heavy I never intended this to be heavy I thought it would be fun to preach but when I got to preaching and I realized how heavy this is how it affects every one of us how it calls us to a greater surrender to a greater death and how impossible listen that at the end of the sermon I feel the same way you do how impossible this will be without God if God hadn't determined that I would move into the stature of a perfect man before the foundation of the world good luck what chance do I have but I believe with all my heart he determined me to that destination that he knew who what attributes of his would would arrive in the end time and he knew what it would take to get them to that position and so when he had to move people to a higher plane he released more of his word so what was it that brought him higher a release of his word so at the end time when we had to come to the very image to be so much like him she will be in his very image amen he had to release the full measure of his word and the full measure of his word is to bring us into the full manifestation of Christ I believe it's for now and I believe it's for me if I didn't I would just go put my head in the hole cry I'd lay under a juniper tree and say God let me die now for I'm no better than my fathers but though I'd be not better than my father's I have been the destiny predestined and ordained to do something different than my father's I have been ordained to come into the image of Jesus Christ and I believe you will and if he has to bring a word that tears to hide off of me then so be it if that's what it takes if he has to do deep heart surgery in me and slice out slivers it's deep inside of me that I didn't know were there then thank God for that because I could have never done it myself if it takes him exposing The Hiding Place the devil's hiding places in my heart then thank God he shined the light on that so that I can surrender it to him because if not I'm walking around holding on to it thinking that everything's fine but God will expose it and all of a sudden I can get angry and upset I can feel hopeless or I can say thank you God now I know there's another area you're wanting to work on in me I don't believe God intends to expose it unless he unless he intends to deal with it and heal it and correct it God is not the god listen he didn't expose Luther's error of smoking and drinking and swearing and hating the Jews he only exposed the air of Catholicism so he could move into that because the age wasn't ready for more so I believe when God is ready to deal with something he exposes it and he doesn't expose it prematurely he exposes it in the time he intends to deal with it so I want to walk away with a heart full of joy knowing that this is what God's calling to me in this day then God must provide the means to Manifest this manifestation because he knows I can't do it he knows I don't have it in my Human Side he goes I can't so if God is calling for this at this hour and he's exposing this in me now then he has a solution already on the scene and that solution is the full measure of his life that was opened up when the seals opened and that is for us I believe with all my heart and I'm going to walk out of here rejoicing because I know that this is what he's going to do in me if I can lay myself in his hand and let the master heart surgeon do the heart surgery I'm going to come out just fine let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for your goodness to us Lord your truth is not always easy Lord it doesn't always feel good but it's always good and Lord your chastisement it's not always Pleasant at the moment but it brings forth the Peaceable fruits of righteousness God I pray you'd help us to surrender to you in a greater way may we give up Lord our own thinking our own thoughts are maybe surrender our emotions or what we feel may we lay it all aside Lord may we make room for you to come take a greater a greater Abode in the side of us take whatever room we empty out whatever we surrender may you take and occupy that space in US move out of us Lord every barrier every hindrance to this manifestation of Your Love may you go on bring us into a higher plane where we can go beyond the human beyond the natural and this love can become Supernatural a regular part of our life supernaturally day by day thinking different acting different responding different or may we recognize that it's you and us may we give you that Liberty that you're looking for in this hour may we yield to you ourselves that you might take the preeminence you've ordained for this time take us Lord use this for your glory we pray bless your people Lord as we go from here may we go with the satisfaction of knowing Lord that you who begun a good work in US shall not cease until your day is accomplished we love you father we commit ourselves to you and ask that you have your way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen change my heart oh God make it ever are true change my heart oh God may I
