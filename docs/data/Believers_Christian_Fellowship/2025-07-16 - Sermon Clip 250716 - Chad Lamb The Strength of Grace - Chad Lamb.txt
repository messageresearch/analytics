TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Because the law of return was every seven years if a man had sold himself a bond slave because he had debts he could not pay and he needed money he could sell himself in as a bond slave to pay off his debts. But at the end of seven years when the trumpet would blow, he could go free. Why could he go free? He could go free because God says when the trumpet blows, you can go free. &gt;&gt; That's the only reason. He didn't have to pay any money. He didn't have to get a ransom. He didn't have to speak for him. He didn't need a letter from the high priest. Amen. The law was written because this is grace. If you mess up and you don't manage your affairs or you fall into trouble or you do something foolish and you have to sell yourself as a bond slave, there's a period of grace coming when you hear the trumpet. That's grace to you. You can go back. Amen. Not because you straightened up your act or you became nice. Are you &gt;&gt; just because &gt;&gt; then at the end of seven Sabbaths 49 years at the end of that there's a 50th year. The 50th year is the Jubilee year. The Jubilee year, Amen, returns all the land of your inheritance. So if you got in financial trouble and you sold your land off, Amen, that land can only be removed from you for a certain period of time. But when the Jubilee call came, when the trumpet sounded, you could go back and take your land back. &gt;&gt; And you didn't have to pay a dime for it. You didn't have to do work for it. You didn't have to do anything. All you had to do was walk back into it because it was yours. &gt;&gt; What is this? This is grace that's embedded in the law. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that land was given to them without effort, without merit, without money, without price. God says, "This is my land and I give it to you as an inheritance." &gt;&gt; So each of their fathers when they were given a portion of land, how much did they pay for that portion of land when it was divided out by Joshua and he and he gave each one a certain portion? What did they pay for it? &gt;&gt; How did they earn it? Nothing. God gave it to him freely. That land was grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then they would do something themselves, their own act that would remove them from God's grace. But in God's grace, he had a fail safe. You're never going to be permanently removed from my grace. You can never be permanently removed from the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he laid the picture in the Old Testament so we could learn something. There is no way, no matter what you do or how vile you are or many mistakes you make, you can get separated from your inheritance. You can be sold into slavery of addiction, sold into slavery of finance, sold into all kinds of slavery that you do yourself. But praise God, if you ever hear that Jubilee trumpet, that's grace to bring you back to your right position, back to your original, which was your original grace. &gt;&gt; Why were they freeborn Israelites? What made them free men in their own land? They didn't pay for it. They didn't earn him. They didn't redeem themselves. God redeemed them out of the hand of Pharaoh. He purchased them with all the plagues. &gt;&gt; He paid the price. He redeemed them and brought them out. So they were freeborn by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't they can't ever say, "I'm fighting for my rights to be free. I'm a free man because my father's f No. Your fathers didn't fight for it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember the plagues? God fought for it. He stoned. He sent plagues. He turned the water to blood. He He He destroyed the firstborn. You didn't do a thing. You're freeborn by grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you have the land by grace. &gt;&gt; It's all by grace. So no matter how much you mess up, God is going to make sure you're never, his children are never permanently separated from his grace.
