========================================

In Philippians 2:5, this is the scripture I want to get to. He said, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God." He didn't think it was robbery to be equal with God because he was God. But now he says, you need to think like this. The mind that was in Christ be in you. Think like this. It's not robbery to say that you're equal with God if you're actually part of God. The the bride is uh is not a creation of God. She's an expression of God. Amen. She she he was the only begotten son, but the bride was in him when he was begotten. So, she was also begotten of God because she was in him. And it's just an expression of God that is being made manifest. Amen. That's why we're joint ears with Christ. Joint just the same. He she can write the check. He can write the check. It's the same joint ears with Christ sitting with him in the throne. And that's why the prophet said, "Oh, if the church only knew its position." But I'm glad he said the next line. He says, "And it will one day." We're we're stepping right into the vision. Amen. Then the rapture will go when it knows what it is. And he says another the unconditional covenant that God made with his people. He says, "Oh, that makes the devil so mad." Sure does when you realize who you are. Amen. That's the revelation. That's the whole point. He's wanting to make himself known to us that we would come to find out that we are kind of his kind. Amen. We're becoming all that he is. Amen. God could not marry a different species. That's right. It's got to be kind of his kind. Mrs. Jesus Christ is like him. And just as brother Raman preached, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. So the bride is part of the mystery of Christ revealed. It's we start to see if when we first read the Bible, I was talking to brother Chad about this the other night. If you when we first read the Bible, it's like two books. The old the Old Testament that's about Jehovah God and it's about uh the law and it's about Israel. And then the ne the New Testament, oh that's about Jesus and that's about grace and that's about the Gentiles. But then when you read the Bible again in the light of the message, when you first come to the message, Brother Ram says it's the revelation of Jesus Christ from cover to cover. But then when you further read the Bible, when the seals come off the book, it's a love story. Oh, all the way through it's him and her. Him and her, we start to see our part. And as brother says, mama, it's me. We see the reflection. This what he's talking about. It's not just talking about a God of history. It's talking about Christ in you, the hope of glory. Amen. The prophet says of the bride, it says the members of this virgin bride will love him. They will have his potentials. Wow. What are the potentials of almighty God of the infinite mind? Well, we can see quite a few quite a lot of evidence of the potentials being expressed. He says, "But she will have his potentials.
