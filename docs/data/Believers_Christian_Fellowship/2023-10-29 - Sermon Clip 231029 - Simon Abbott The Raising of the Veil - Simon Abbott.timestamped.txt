[0:00] now the Mysteries should be finished
[0:05] including the mystery of who she
[0:08] is okay including the mystery of her
[0:13] position in
[0:15] Christ and if we notice it's truly only
[0:18] the last handful of
[0:20] years that that we that that we've
[0:23] realized actually the revelation of who
[0:26] she is and what it means you know he's
[0:28] broken forth and we that brother R said
[0:30] these things
[0:32] but it it wasn't clear to us it wasn't
[0:35] clear to me but like the mirror on the
[0:37] wall that mirror has been there since'
[0:41] 65 the mirror okay but I was kind of
[0:45] still pulling my ear I don't you I was
[0:46] pulling and I was waving and it took
[0:49] that certain amount of time for us to
[0:50] realize whoa actually can this be can it
[0:55] be you know just sometimes it's just so
[0:59] to too much you know we we've walking
[1:02] down the aisle and we've come right down
[1:04] to the front
[1:05] here and don't
[1:07] forget just break it it to you gently
[1:09] Jack you can't walk further than
[1:12] here this is the furthest you can
[1:16] get without taking another
[1:20] name see what I mean you can walk as far
[1:23] as the altar the only way out is to go
[1:25] back out that way and you're carrying a
[1:28] new name that's where we are it's
[1:31] awesome and we're carrying his name his
[1:34] name so as we get down to the altar now
[1:36] we're starting to realize who we are
[1:38] suddenly now we can see clearly and the
[1:40] bride's identity is being
[1:43] unveiled I mean think of it 20 years ago
[1:46] I don't know you I we traveled a lot so
[1:49] we heard a lot of preaching but we would
[1:51] hear like oh your bride your bride your
[1:53] bride you know everything's fine but
[1:56] nobody kind of knew what it meant you
[1:58] know but we way up the aisle somewhere
[2:02] and he was just like oh well
[2:03] everything's fine and the the veil was
[2:05] kind of swinging and all we knew was
[2:07] your bride your bride your bride but 20
[2:09] years ago it wasn't time cuz we were
[2:10] still up there we weren't down here and
[2:13] so the unveiling of the Bride it has to
[2:16] happen right before the Rapture it has
[2:19] to because don't
[2:21] forget the Rapture happens after the
[2:23] marriage takes place because the
[2:25] marriage supper follows the marriage we
[2:29] go to the marriage supper and don't
[2:31] forget the veil is only lifted when
[2:35] she's married when the vows have been
[2:37] given yeah then the veil is lifted
