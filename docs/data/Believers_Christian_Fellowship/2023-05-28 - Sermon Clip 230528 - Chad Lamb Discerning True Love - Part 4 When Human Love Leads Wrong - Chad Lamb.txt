TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we know that God has promised us if we pay tithes if we pay tithes that he promised the blessing that we can't contain and he'll prevent the Devourer from devouring we know that is that the promise but sometimes we see brothers or sisters they get into some difficulty some hardship maybe a financial situation amen and we may not realize that the Devourer has come because God has allowed it because they're not faithful in their tithes and we were simply one sympathy want to relieve the pressure on our brother and sister and so we keep funneling money and funneling money and funneling money because that's what we should do as loving people right we should not let anybody suffer amen we should take away all suffering we have means that take away all suffering but the problem is amen they're out of the will of God out of the word of God and all of my human compassion is never going to fix this problem there's an empty well that money will not fix because the problem is a spiritual problem they're off the word and I need to talk to them enough to realize Hey listen I think I understand what's going on Amen have you been paying your time well no I I got a little behind and I'm this and that and the other and and and and you know there's always a reason but there's never a good reason and so I could say oh yeah it's all right we understand and this and that and let me help out listen that's not help that's not love is to say listen brother sister I love you listen but the problem that I see is you're not lined up to the word if you get lined up to the word God has promised a blessing and I don't have the power within myself to override God's word and if I attempt to now my love oh I hope you understand now my love is evil now my love is wrong I'm in error I'm contrary to the word because of human compassion that doesn't mean we don't help people out my goodness we help people all the time we want to help people but but and there's times that there's help needed there's scriptures for that but oh God help us to help the right way help us to be loving help us to love our brothers the way God loved the Rich Young Ruler the way Jesus Christ loved him help us to love one another that would help us to have true genuine love of God in our hearts and not feel like that not feel like because we keep doing things that we're good we keep relieving pressures we keep handing out that listen we may be going absolutely contrary to the word of God in that amen we need some discernment we need God to lead us by spiritual leadership and maybe we need to ask some questions sometimes and give real love because real love true love will always bring us back to the word because true correction will always bring us back to the word and true love is corrective
