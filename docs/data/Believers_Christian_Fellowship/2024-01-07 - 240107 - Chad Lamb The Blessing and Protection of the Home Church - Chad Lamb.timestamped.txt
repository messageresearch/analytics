[10:51] alone in into thy
[10:55] presence we
[10:58] come
[11:01] amen God bless you this morning let's
[11:03] bow our heads together
[11:06] Lord we're so thankful Lord that we can
[11:08] come into your presence not just in a
[11:11] building Lord but anytime you've invited
[11:15] us to come but God we've set aside this
[11:18] time to join ourselves together Lord to
[11:22] come according to your command to to un
[11:25] unify ourselves Lord and to look unto
[11:27] you and to feed from your hand
[11:29] we pray God that you would just come
[11:31] down and break the bread of life for us
[11:34] Feed Us Lord as your sheep we wait upon
[11:36] you Lord and trust in you for we've come
[11:38] according to your provided way Lord I
[11:41] pray you would take this vessel of My
[11:44] Flesh under your control and Minister
[11:46] Lord through a gift you've placed there
[11:48] help me to stay completely out of your
[11:50] way and let you do what you want to do
[11:52] this morning for I want to be a
[11:54] surrendered vessel a tool that's in your
[11:56] hand God I'm trusting in you you to
[11:59] deliver your word God strengthen us
[12:02] equip us encourage us correct us help us
[12:05] Lord to have all that we need in this
[12:07] life for we know that it comes from you
[12:09] father and only by you will we be able
[12:11] to move and do what you've called us to
[12:15] do in this hour we ask for your
[12:17] blessings over this service we thank you
[12:18] for the privilege of being here for
[12:20] drawing us together in Jesus Christ's
[12:23] name we pray
[12:25] amen amen God bless you amen if you take
[12:29] your Bibles we're going to go to the
[12:30] book of Hebrews and as you're turning
[12:32] there I just want to say I'm so happy to
[12:34] see some snow on the ground I know some
[12:36] of you may not agree with me I mean we
[12:38] don't have to agree amen God said God's
[12:40] children he made a variety when he made
[12:43] his children some like the mountains
[12:44] some like the deserts some like this and
[12:46] that but I like winter and somebody
[12:50] think says thinks I'm perverted because
[12:51] Winter's a sign of
[12:54] death but you know somebody's got to
[12:56] like it amen but no I always say if it's
[13:00] going to be C cold it might as well be
[13:02] pretty amen so I'm thankful that we
[13:04] could still drive to church and the
[13:06] roads were good and everybody made it
[13:07] safely want to thank you for that or
[13:09] thank God for that but also I wanted to
[13:11] mention it reminds me that every year
[13:13] you know we have the potential of
[13:14] snowstorms and it comes up and it looked
[13:17] like this year was going to be none but
[13:19] it's always the potential and I just
[13:21] want to remind everybody that you know
[13:24] we we will do the best we can myself and
[13:26] the deacons with the input of the
[13:28] trustees as well try to make the best
[13:30] decision for the congregation when it
[13:32] gets to that weather and you know one
[13:34] thing I hate about weather is every
[13:36] storm comes Saturday night Sunday
[13:38] morning or Wednesday afternoon so you
[13:41] can about guarantee when it's going to
[13:42] snow yeah and so that's always
[13:44] frustrating for me because I I either
[13:46] want it to be clearly you can't do it or
[13:49] clearly it's safe and it's never that
[13:52] way it's always something in between and
[13:54] so just pray for us when we get into
[13:56] that situation that we can make the
[13:58] right decision
[13:59] amen we certainly want to have church
[14:01] every time we possibly can have it and
[14:03] we've always said before I said many
[14:05] times if you feel uncomfortable please
[14:07] don't drive those who can come will come
[14:10] we'll have service you can stream the
[14:13] problem is as soon as I say that people
[14:14] will come anyways and everybody knows
[14:16] that if that's a hard service to get to
[14:18] that's going to be a really good service
[14:20] so I'm going to go is that right so we
[14:23] know the way we all think we all think
[14:25] the same way you're like oh you can't
[14:26] hardly get there I'm going
[14:31] so that being the case sometimes we have
[14:33] to make a decision and sometimes you
[14:34] have to make a call early enough ahead
[14:37] for those who live far away and have to
[14:39] drive so that they're not already on the
[14:40] road and sometimes it's a good decision
[14:43] sometimes it's a bad decision so we just
[14:45] pray ask you pray for us and if we make
[14:47] a bad decision forgive us but you know
[14:49] the reason why we want to do the best we
[14:51] can for the congregation and keep
[14:53] everybody safe it would be really hard
[14:55] for us to make this decision and hear if
[14:57] somebody got off the road Road and got
[14:59] in a ditch and that would be terrible so
[15:01] we just pray that God will continue to
[15:03] give us his leadership so that we know
[15:06] what he wants us to do amen and I hope
[15:09] we get a big old gigantic
[15:11] snowstorm Monday morning
[15:14] someday and it's all cleaned up by
[15:17] Wednesday that would thrill my heart
[15:20] amen amen Hebrews chapter 10 let's look
[15:24] together at verse
[15:27] 23
[15:32] Hebrews chap 10: 23 let us hold fast the
[15:36] profession of our faith without wavering
[15:38] for he is faithful that promised and let
[15:40] us consider one another to provoke unto
[15:43] love and to Good Works not forsaking the
[15:45] assembling of ourselves together as the
[15:47] manner of some is but exhorting one
[15:49] another and so much more as you see that
[15:52] day approaching amen God bless you as
[15:55] you have your seats and may the Lord
[15:57] bless us as we look into it his word may
[15:59] he give us eyes to see and ears to hear
[16:03] amen this this morning I'd like to
[16:05] preach a subject on the blessing and
[16:07] protection of the home Church the
[16:10] blessing and the protection of the home
[16:12] church this is something that struck me
[16:14] some time ago I don't remember how long
[16:15] ago and I jotted a few things down and
[16:17] that happens sometimes I'll catch
[16:18] inspiration it happens many times I'll
[16:20] jot it down on a piece of paper and
[16:22] throw it and uh and throw it in my uh
[16:24] briefcase and I'll have it with me and
[16:26] then when something strikes I'll pull it
[16:28] out this is what happened uh this this
[16:30] just struck me and come back and there
[16:33] there's a reason I'll get to the
[16:34] scripture that really made me start
[16:37] meditating on this it's not this one
[16:39] it's a different one and when I get
[16:40] there I'll let you know because it's the
[16:42] blessing and protection of the home
[16:45] church and here we have uh uh an
[16:48] admonishment in the book of Hebrews we
[16:50] have a command that we hold fast the
[16:52] profession of our faith without wavering
[16:55] and but let us consider one another to
[16:57] provoke un to love and good work works
[16:58] not forsaking the assembling of
[17:00] ourselves together as the manner of some
[17:02] is but exhorting one another and so much
[17:05] more as you see the day approaching so
[17:07] we know that we see that day approaching
[17:10] that we're at the end time the finality
[17:12] of everything is closing in and that
[17:14] evil day is upon us amen but we also
[17:17] been given instruction what to do in
[17:19] that day and that's to gather together
[17:21] and to provoke one another to love in
[17:23] good works and to exhort one another
[17:26] amen so so that's the purpose of Us
[17:29] coming together is to provoke one
[17:31] another to love and good works I love
[17:34] this word provoke in the in the New
[17:36] Testament it's really an interesting
[17:38] word because at first it doesn't seem to
[17:41] be a very pleasant word to provoke is to
[17:47] irritate you know I I I don't really
[17:51] want to read that let's irritate one
[17:53] another into loving good works but
[17:56] really it's almost like a poking in you
[17:58] know it's like a cattle prod it's like
[18:00] the ox goat in the back that little poke
[18:02] to move forward amen and there's there's
[18:05] times that we can encourage one another
[18:07] I don't think through irritation I don't
[18:09] think that's the that's the full meaning
[18:11] of that but we do we have a
[18:13] responsibility one another and we need
[18:15] to be subject to one another and we need
[18:17] one another the reality is that we don't
[18:20] do well all by ourselves and God never
[18:22] intended us for us Believers to be all
[18:24] by ourselves and there's something that
[18:27] the fellowship does for one another when
[18:29] we can encourage one another amen and
[18:31] sometimes that encouragement is because
[18:33] you realize that when you come in the
[18:35] midst of your brothers and sisters that
[18:37] some of the things you're thinking and
[18:38] doing aren't
[18:40] working there's that little that little
[18:43] rub that little push and you realize
[18:45] that statement didn't fly amen that
[18:47] action is not working I can't say that
[18:50] in the company of my brothers and I
[18:51] can't do that in within the earshot or
[18:54] ey shot of my brothers and sisters amen
[18:56] and what that's doing is that's just
[18:57] prodding us along into the things that
[18:59] are good amen because we are all still
[19:02] human beings and we all still have a
[19:04] sticky cobber nature we all still live
[19:07] in the midst of leod deia and we need
[19:09] one another for the encouragement to
[19:11] keep moving forward some of that is
[19:13] positive encouragement I say it's all
[19:15] positive encouragement because it goes
[19:17] in a positive direction but Su of is the
[19:19] very fact that a brother will say I
[19:21] don't agree with that
[19:23] brother I don't think that's healthy I
[19:25] don't think that's good or please don't
[19:27] talk about that brother to me I don't
[19:30] think we should say things like that
[19:32] amen and that's a
[19:34] provoking but not because we're trying
[19:36] to irritate one another you understand
[19:38] what I'm saying but it's just saying you
[19:40] know that that conduct won't fly in the
[19:42] midst of the congregation I know that I
[19:44] can't just say whatever I want I can't
[19:46] just do whatever I want I there's
[19:48] something that about coming together
[19:50] that actually keeps our mind aligned to
[19:53] the things that are
[19:54] right amen and now we know there's a
[19:57] balance to that we're going to talk
[19:58] about about that as we move further down
[20:00] but then it goes now we we're to
[20:02] assemble ourselves together and exhort
[20:04] one
[20:06] another so much more as you see the day
[20:09] approaching this word ex exort is also
[20:11] interesting and I'll there's a lot of
[20:13] words that uh it's it's translated into
[20:16] but I want to read some of the
[20:17] definition says to address or speak to
[20:21] which may be done in the way of
[20:22] exhortation in treaty Comfort
[20:25] instruction also exhorting and
[20:28] comforting and encouraging encouraging
[20:31] and strengthening instructing and
[20:33] teaching this is all exhorting so when
[20:35] we get together to exhort one another
[20:38] what are we doing it's you can say
[20:40] exhorting if we could use just the term
[20:42] that we would all understand is
[20:44] coaching exhorting is encouraging a amen
[20:48] strengthening also comforting intreating
[20:52] instructing amen bringing comfort and
[20:54] encouragement we're here to do that for
[20:56] one another because we need that it's a
[21:00] command in the scriptures because we
[21:01] need that we don't come all the way up
[21:04] to the end of all things and the capping
[21:05] off of everything in the stature of a
[21:07] perfect man and we come to the perfect
[21:09] strength and understanding of the word
[21:10] and now I don't need anybody I've come
[21:13] to
[21:15] maturity that's not in the scriptures
[21:17] the scriptures aren't written that way
[21:19] amen when we come to the capping off of
[21:21] the church when we come uh uh to the
[21:23] adoption amen it doesn't it doesn't do
[21:26] away with this need for the body because
[21:28] we've come to maturity we have a perfect
[21:30] no amen because if it was so it wouldn't
[21:33] be in the scriptures that we need to
[21:35] come together to provoke one another to
[21:37] love and good works and to exhort one
[21:40] another amen so we need the body and
[21:43] it's a blessing to have the
[21:45] body now when I'm talking about the body
[21:48] just today for today's purposes I'm just
[21:50] speaking of the local body or a Home
[21:52] church and we know that this the the
[21:54] home church is not the whole body of
[21:56] Christ it's a universal body of of
[21:58] Christ everywhere and that we make up
[22:00] just a teeny fragment of that Global
[22:04] body but but like I've said before what
[22:07] works in the macrocosm works in the
[22:09] microcosm so what works for the entire
[22:11] body of Christ works for the local body
[22:13] as well so I'm I'm going to speak Amen
[22:16] on terms of the local body but I'm not
[22:18] in any way doing away with the global
[22:20] body so don't don't think those thoughts
[22:22] we still must be engaged with the body
[22:24] around the world we still must be a part
[22:26] and parcel giving and exchanging
[22:29] provoking and encouraging with every
[22:31] believer not just the ones we fellowship
[22:33] with in the place that we go and
[22:35] assemble ourselves so so don't think I'm
[22:37] saying that amen I'm just I'm laying I'm
[22:40] I'm laying out the the the guidelines so
[22:42] nobody gets their mind going because
[22:43] there's always something else you can
[22:45] say on every subject you can always
[22:47] further balance it amen there's no way
[22:49] you can come to every subject and say he
[22:51] said that but what about there's always
[22:52] a butt what about but just know that I'm
[22:55] just talking about the local church and
[22:57] then no one way discouraging us from
[22:59] fellowship in the global church that's
[23:01] still a
[23:02] requirement in Proverbs 27 let's turn
[23:05] there together we're going to uh uh pull
[23:08] in a few
[23:10] scriptures as we move along I actually
[23:12] have quite a bit that I want to share I
[23:15] I don't that doesn't mean I'm
[23:17] necessarily going to be a long time so
[23:19] don't get nervous but I have quite a bit
[23:21] that I want to share and I actually
[23:23] don't want to rush through it so I'm
[23:24] actually going to take take my time but
[23:26] that doesn't mean that I'm going to take
[23:28] a long time it just means I'm not going
[23:29] to talk super super
[23:31] fast don't get nervous I'm going to take
[23:34] my time Proverbs
[23:37] 27 verse1
[23:41] 17 iron sharpeneth iron so a man
[23:45] sharpeneth the countenance of his
[23:47] friend amen there's a purpose be with
[23:51] this fellowship and friendship and it
[23:53] it's not necessarily just always make us
[23:56] feel good although it does
[23:58] but as iron sharpeneth iron uh metal
[24:01] against metal will bring out a
[24:03] sharpening a keenness a sharpening down
[24:07] and also a removing of access
[24:11] material and a friend can do this for a
[24:14] friend but it says a friend can sharpen
[24:16] the countenance of his friend this word
[24:18] countenance actually means
[24:21] face he can sharpen the face of his
[24:23] friend but I I mean I don't think we're
[24:25] supposed to do that physically some
[24:28] friends have sharpened the face of their
[24:30] friends in the past but but that face
[24:33] means your presence or your person or
[24:35] your personage and your very presence
[24:38] and who you are is being shaped by your
[24:42] relationships and fellowship and it's
[24:45] very very important that's why it's
[24:46] important who we company with amen this
[24:50] is the very reason it matters who we
[24:52] keep company with amen and and also you
[24:55] know all of us uh we're all the we're
[24:58] all the same in many ways I know there's
[25:00] a variation in personalities there's a
[25:02] variation but there's also a
[25:04] commonality because of being human
[25:07] beings and being in this hybrid flesh
[25:09] and the commonality is none of us none
[25:12] of us none of us none of us really enjoy
[25:16] conflict enjoy differences or enjoy uh
[25:19] being
[25:21] challenged some people love to argue but
[25:23] not all of us love to be challenged amen
[25:25] but it's that very challenge of a friend
[25:28] amen that actually makes us who we are
[25:31] and sometimes if we only find friends
[25:33] that align with our thinking and agree
[25:35] with everything we ever say Amen maybe
[25:37] that's not the friend that we need the
[25:39] most amen maybe sometimes we need that
[25:41] friend that has a different viewpoint on
[25:43] things sometimes and is not afraid to
[25:45] say I don't understand that no run that
[25:48] past me one more time how did you get to
[25:50] that conclusion and you're like don't
[25:52] challenge me you're my friend just say
[25:54] you're a wonderful person everything you
[25:56] think is amazing and you there's no
[25:57] fault in you ever those are all the
[26:00] friends that I want around me that
[26:01] that's not going to accomplish the
[26:03] purpose of a iron sharpening iron and a
[26:05] friend sharpening the face of a friend
[26:07] your very being your very person so we
[26:10] don't want to be afraid of those things
[26:11] as long as it's love as long as it's a
[26:13] friend not contention and arguing and St
[26:16] that's never the purpose amen but it's
[26:18] so good that God in every assembly and
[26:20] in all of our friendships I mean how
[26:22] many times have you seen two of the
[26:25] exact identical personality type get
[26:30] married they say opposites attract for a
[26:32] reason that became a saying for a reason
[26:35] that wasn't just made up amen why
[26:38] because we need different perspectives
[26:40] Amen to keep us moving down the center
[26:42] of the line right and so it's very
[26:46] uncommon for two of The Identical
[26:48] personality Ty you have two super
[26:50] outgoing super flamboy amen super
[26:53] energetic people married together nope
[26:56] usually if you have one that's really
[26:58] strong one way you'll have one that's
[26:59] almost as strong the other way and they
[27:03] come together so our friendships amen
[27:05] what God put us together and in a body
[27:07] of Believers amen we we you have you'll
[27:09] find every personality type amen why
[27:12] because it's for the benefit of each of
[27:14] us for the
[27:16] whole and so we find that in a home
[27:20] church when we come together to
[27:22] Fellowship it's more than just sitting
[27:25] in our seat attending a church service
[27:28] there's much more we're to provoke one
[27:30] another to love and good works we're to
[27:32] uh uh uh um we're to encourage one
[27:35] another we're to strengthen One Another
[27:36] We're to sharpen one another's
[27:38] countenance so there's so much more to
[27:41] the home Church than just I sit in this
[27:44] Pew on Sunday and Wednesday that's not
[27:47] that's not really a home
[27:48] church if all we do is walk in the last
[27:51] minute sit down here the service walk
[27:53] back out the door and never talk to
[27:55] anybody never have any Fellowship no
[27:57] disc discussions no interaction really I
[27:59] think we've missed some of the benefit
[28:01] of a home
[28:02] Church brother B said in the voice of
[28:05] the sign he said now tomorrow is Sunday
[28:07] and there'll be Sunday School in
[28:08] churches the reason we have our services
[28:10] in the afternoon on Sunday is so we
[28:12] won't interrupt any service at all we
[28:15] believe every Christian ought to have a
[28:17] home church that they go to every
[28:19] Christian ought to meet somewhere with
[28:20] Believers and wherever you meet that's
[28:23] the church and brother Ram's not
[28:25] limiting that to location or size it can
[28:27] be in a home it can be four three four
[28:30] five Believers it can be a large place
[28:33] it can be a rented facility be building
[28:35] a traditional Church it can be a home I
[28:37] mean he's had services in
[28:39] trailers so it's it does not he's saying
[28:41] but a place where the Believers gathered
[28:44] together everybody he said every
[28:47] Christian ought to meet somewhere with
[28:52] Believers he says I believe every
[28:54] Christian ought to have a home Church
[28:56] they go to now when I say that I also
[28:59] want to uh uh make a disclaimer amen I I
[29:02] realize that so this is preaching
[29:04] through the choir because you're all
[29:06] here but I want us to understand the
[29:09] benefit and the protection of what God's
[29:12] given us so I want to do some teaching
[29:14] on this because it's not like saying you
[29:16] guys need to have a home Church you're
[29:17] like I'm here every one of you you're
[29:21] here I mean you have a home church so I
[29:23] I know this is preaching through the
[29:25] choir but we're laying down the
[29:26] foundation so we can move to what does
[29:28] that actually mean in our lives what is
[29:29] that producing and and and more than
[29:32] anything when I walk away from the end
[29:33] of the service today I want to be
[29:35] thankful to God that he's given us a
[29:37] fellowship I want to realize how
[29:39] precious that is and what a benefit it
[29:41] is and how meaningful it is that we're
[29:44] not alone that we're not walking this
[29:46] path alone we're not uh you know and
[29:48] there's some people that don't have the
[29:50] privilege of that there's many
[29:51] circumstances that are out there and I'm
[29:53] not here to judge them all and say if
[29:55] you don't have a home Church you're
[29:56] you're you're you're toast brother bam
[29:58] said everybody needs one but many people
[30:00] find themselves in between for whatever
[30:01] reasons they have a pastor who dies a
[30:03] church who disbands they have their bed
[30:05] fast now amen there's all kinds of
[30:07] reasons people get stuck in situations
[30:09] whether permanent or temporary and I'm
[30:11] not here to judge that God will take
[30:12] care of them he knows the motive and
[30:14] intent of the heart but the general rule
[30:16] I'm speaking in generalities everybody
[30:19] needs a home
[30:21] church and it's not so I can check that
[30:24] box and say now I'm right no you need
[30:27] need a home church God knows that you
[30:29] need a home not to say uh brother B said
[30:32] I need a home Church check and brother B
[30:33] said I need a rest check and no it's has
[30:36] nothing to do with checking the boxes it
[30:38] has everything to do with realizing I'm
[30:40] not going to church because brother bam
[30:42] said go to church I'm going to church
[30:43] cuz he said it for a reason because it's
[30:46] the word because I need
[30:49] it this is the problem amen we find so
[30:52] many times even in our fellowships you
[30:54] have people who will do it amen but they
[30:56] always kind of Stay On The Fringe of the
[30:58] home Church never fully in integrated
[31:01] never fully committed never giving their
[31:03] all amen because they're checking a
[31:05] check box that I've done what brother B
[31:07] said but the home church is more than
[31:10] just a place we slip in and slip out
[31:12] amen God wants us to be engaged there's
[31:14] no sharpening of the countenance when we
[31:16] just slip in and slip out there's so
[31:19] much more benefit amen that we're we we
[31:22] are meant to gain than just that's where
[31:24] I go hear the word and leave amen amen
[31:29] so there's a reason that he laid down
[31:31] these principles there's a reason it's
[31:32] in the word there's a reason we we're
[31:33] taught these things and when we don't
[31:36] understand what it's doing for us then
[31:38] we don't give the proper Credence to it
[31:40] that we
[31:41] should he also said in the message what
[31:44] house will you build me and when this
[31:46] message is in 1965 uh Perry green had
[31:49] just opened the church in Tucson and
[31:51] there was many Believers that went down
[31:52] there when brother Brenham went and they
[31:53] didn't have a church they could to go to
[31:55] amen they were and they had been out of
[31:57] fellowship and brother B starts talking
[31:59] about we had folks that were just laying
[32:01] home on Sundays kids little kids were
[32:03] riding their bicycles on Sunday in the
[32:05] street and no church to fellowship at no
[32:07] place to come and brother bam comes in
[32:09] that service and he says now that
[32:11] brother green God has sent him here and
[32:13] opened us up a church of like Precious
[32:16] faith that we believe in we ought to be
[32:18] very grateful to God and attend every
[32:20] service and take every place that we can
[32:24] if we are asked and called on to pray
[32:25] seek to do let's be soldiers right at it
[32:28] just anxious to do it he's talking about
[32:31] being a
[32:32] contributor not just a an attender but a
[32:34] contributor am keep the message
[32:37] honorable live the right kind of life
[32:39] don't let no smut come upon it we're
[32:41] living too late now we're too late in
[32:44] the hour let's live it clean uh or my
[32:46] life your life all of our Lives need to
[32:48] be picked up before God Amen uh our
[32:52] young people just ride around from place
[32:54] to place from show to show drifting
[32:56] further and further away from God now
[32:58] that's the truth I see it in my children
[33:00] I see it in myself getting to a place we
[33:02] not you've got to assem you've got to
[33:06] assemble ourselves together to worship
[33:07] God the Bible said so when we see this
[33:11] day approaching that much more come
[33:12] together if there's only two people here
[33:14] you be one of them and if we come
[33:17] together and worship together then we
[33:19] just then we just something or another
[33:22] about it Jesus said where two or three
[33:24] are gathered in my name there I am and
[33:26] there
[33:27] mened so brother bham when he comes to
[33:30] preach what house will you build me it's
[33:31] the dedication of that Tabernacle and
[33:34] and and and he's so thankful that God
[33:36] gave him a place to come to he was
[33:38] expressing his gratitude he was
[33:40] expressing the need and the people for
[33:42] it it wasn't working the way it was
[33:46] before he also said in the sermon of
[33:48] spirits every man ought to have a church
[33:51] home you ought to have a place not just
[33:53] to float about from Pillar To Post but
[33:55] have somewhere that you go to church and
[33:57] you call it your church somewhere you
[33:59] pay your tithe and somewhere that you
[34:01] help support the
[34:04] cause see when we when we look at some
[34:07] of the things the prophet's saying it's
[34:09] not just a place that I go to
[34:12] get but it's also a place I go to
[34:16] give because that's iron sharpening iron
[34:18] that's provoking one another to love and
[34:20] good works and and we if we don't take
[34:22] away the right mentality amen then I
[34:25] just go to church to
[34:27] get and then sometimes we'll we'll walk
[34:30] away and disappoint cuz I didn't get
[34:34] anything but the question is what did
[34:36] you
[34:38] give what we're here to support the work
[34:41] amen we're here to create an atmosphere
[34:44] brother Benham said an atmosphere you
[34:46] can have a birth in the right kind of
[34:48] atmosphere so we're coming together
[34:51] sometimes what we're coming for amen is
[34:53] just to create the right kind of
[34:55] atmosphere so somebody can be born and
[34:56] in the service we're lending our support
[34:59] amen we're we're throwing our shoulder
[35:01] to the wheel for the work of God to move
[35:03] it on because this is one of God's
[35:05] mechanisms the home church this is God's
[35:07] part of God's plan and we're throwing
[35:09] oursel into it committed to it to
[35:12] receive and to give not just to get
[35:14] something out of it but to give
[35:15] something as well to be a contribut a
[35:18] contributing Force amen not just a
[35:22] drain amen none of us want to be the
[35:25] parasite in the church
[35:27] sucking sucking sucking sucking but
[35:29] never giving anything back we all want
[35:32] to be we want to have a symbiotic
[35:34] relationship where we're giving and
[35:35] taking giving and taking G that's a
[35:37] healthy relationship amen amen so it's
[35:42] it's uh very very important that we have
[35:45] someplace that you help support the
[35:48] cause we're not all flying
[35:53] solo that's right
[35:55] amen God wants us to come together to
[35:58] work together for the kingdom of God
[36:01] like I said there's a balance to that
[36:02] we'll talk about that we don't want to
[36:04] get anything out of balance but we we'll
[36:06] speak on that in just a few minutes but
[36:08] I want to go to the scripture now that
[36:10] really started my mind uh meditating on
[36:13] this if you can go to 1 Corinthians
[36:15] chapter 5 this came to me one day I
[36:17] wasn't even reading the Scripture it
[36:19] just dropped in my heart and I started
[36:20] meditating on it and I really got an
[36:24] inspiration and and been meditating on
[36:26] on it since and in 1 Corinthians chapter
[36:30] 5 I'm going to read this and it's going
[36:32] to read as a negative portion of the
[36:34] scripture but I'm not going to take it
[36:36] in a negative way so we're going to look
[36:38] at 1 Corinthians chapter
[36:40] 5 and I'm going to begin right at the
[36:42] beginning of the
[36:44] chapter in verse
[36:46] one and it is reported commonly that
[36:49] there is fornication among you and such
[36:51] fornication as is not so much as named
[36:54] among the Gentiles that one should have
[36:56] his father father's wife and you are
[36:58] puffed up and have not not rather
[37:00] mourned that he that ha done this deed
[37:03] might be taken away from among you for I
[37:05] verily as absent in the body but present
[37:08] in the spirit have judged already as
[37:09] though I were present concerning him
[37:11] that has so done this deed in the name
[37:14] of our Lord Jesus Christ when you are
[37:16] gathered together in my spirit with the
[37:18] power of our Lord Jesus Christ to
[37:20] deliver such a one unto Satan for the
[37:22] destruction of the flesh that the spirit
[37:25] may be saved in the day of the Lord
[37:27] Jesus your glorying is not good know you
[37:30] not that A little leaven leaveneth the
[37:32] whole lump so I I I it was that
[37:36] scripture in this next quote that I'm
[37:38] going to read that came together and
[37:40] this quote is out of questions and
[37:41] answers on the Holy Ghost says that's
[37:44] what's the matter with the churches
[37:45] today when a man comes into the body of
[37:47] Christ and becomes one of the members
[37:49] and starts doing evil instead of you all
[37:51] getting together and doing this very
[37:53] same thing you brandom Tabernacle do
[37:55] that because as as long as you're
[37:57] holding him up he's under the
[37:59] blood and he just keeps doing the same
[38:02] old thing over and over and over all the
[38:04] time you get together and turn him over
[38:06] to the devil for the destruction of the
[38:08] flesh that his Spirit might be saved in
[38:10] the day of the Lord and watch the whip
[38:12] of God come in watch The Devil take a
[38:15] hold of him that's an evil spirit gets
[38:17] him and this boy he's referring back to
[38:19] the scripture this boy here straightened
[38:21] out he come back we find out in second
[38:23] Corinthians where he really cleaned up
[38:25] before God so we we when we talk about
[38:28] that as in the form of church discipline
[38:30] it it has a very negative feel to it
[38:31] because nobody ever likes this there's
[38:33] never been I I don't know nothing that
[38:36] I'm aware of where church discipline has
[38:38] been administered and everybody feels
[38:39] good about it I mean it's terrible but
[38:42] the reality is if it's if it's if what
[38:47] what I what I want to back up and say is
[38:49] what I felt what I was meditating on
[38:51] what struck me was not that you got to
[38:53] put away the evildoer what struck me is
[38:56] if you're not the church is actually
[38:58] protecting him from
[39:00] wrath that's what actually struck me
[39:03] that the church is a barrier and a
[39:06] protecting Force against wrath and
[39:08] against evil spirits that actually God
[39:12] would discipline this man and God would
[39:14] whip him with an evil spirit but because
[39:16] he was in the church and in the
[39:18] fellowship there was a barrier even
[39:20] against the whip of
[39:22] God and this began to just astonish me
[39:25] amen the power power and the level of
[39:27] protection that a home church has now if
[39:30] a home church has this level of
[39:33] protection against this evil spirit that
[39:35] be a whip of God to drive the man back
[39:37] amen what about all the other evil
[39:39] spirits that are around is the home
[39:41] Church also a barrier to those demons of
[39:44] sickness Demons of this Demons of
[39:46] depression amen all of a sudden between
[39:49] this scripture and the quote I realize
[39:52] there's a power and a level of
[39:53] protection just being in the local the
[39:56] body of Christ and in the home church
[39:58] amen that we need to be aware of because
[40:00] there's a tremendous benefit we have no
[40:03] idea what our lives would actually be
[40:05] like if we removed ourselves and stepped
[40:07] out from this protection that is there
[40:09] by the grace of
[40:11] God brother Brenham says in Christ is
[40:14] the mystery of God revealed he said the
[40:15] church is the blood of Christ by the
[40:17] spirit amen because the life is in the
[40:19] blood that's the baptism of the Holy
[40:20] Ghost and baptizes unto his body that
[40:23] recognizes only his body his flesh his
[40:25] word amen so now now where is that blood
[40:28] protection amen amen the church is the
[40:31] blood by the spirit why because the
[40:33] blood represents the life where's the
[40:34] life in the body in the body of Christ
[40:37] in his body on Earth amen which is a
[40:39] many membered body amen and in that is
[40:42] the very Life of Christ and there's a
[40:44] certain buffer Amen in our lives and the
[40:48] and and there was nothing happening to
[40:51] this
[40:52] man until the church removed him from
[40:56] the
[40:58] buffer they had the Paul was telling
[41:00] them remove this man from the buffer and
[41:03] now listen I'm not talking about all the
[41:05] trials and things that come to our life
[41:06] that shape us and teach us and educate
[41:08] us and give us testimony there's still
[41:10] all of that but beyond all of that
[41:11] there's something about the body and
[41:14] being in the body and being in
[41:15] Fellowship that protects us from evil
[41:19] spirits and now that Paul's saying a
[41:22] amen you're you're not doing this man
[41:24] any good and you're not doing the church
[41:27] any good yeah right because and this is
[41:30] the danger this is where it gets really
[41:32] dangerous and this is where it really
[41:33] becomes problematic amen when you leave
[41:37] that sin that repetitive against the
[41:40] word unrepentant sin when you leave that
[41:42] in the body there'll be a certain level
[41:44] of protection and God may not destroy
[41:46] that man but what it happens is it
[41:48] becomes a leaven in the church and
[41:52] slowly begins to leaven the whole
[41:54] lump until the whole church becomes
[41:58] sick and weak and
[42:02] deteriorated so that's why these things
[42:04] are important both ways it's important
[42:06] that these issues don't just get swept
[42:08] under the rug and and let let go and
[42:10] they have to be dealt with amen for the
[42:12] for the benefit of those who are in
[42:14] error and for the benefit of everybody
[42:16] else and the Apostle Paul gives this
[42:18] instruction for a reason and we see it
[42:20] in the scripture work for this man comes
[42:22] later and he repents and Paul says he
[42:25] that repented bring quickly back into
[42:27] Fellowship unless he' be
[42:29] discouraged Paul's not interested in
[42:31] punishment for punishment's sake Paul is
[42:33] interested in reconciliation and
[42:37] restitution he's looking at the soul and
[42:39] the health of the
[42:41] church so now we realize that now being
[42:45] in this Fellowship offers us a
[42:48] protection that I don't think we're
[42:50] actually fully aware
[42:54] of we there's a unity and a bond in a
[43:00] local church and in the global Church
[43:02] we're speaking of local church there's a
[43:05] unity and a bond that actually does
[43:07] something special for us there's also a
[43:10] life in the midst of the body amen which
[43:13] is the Life of Christ which is the
[43:15] spirit of God which is the
[43:18] representation of the
[43:20] blood and it buffers us from so much of
[43:25] life
[43:27] there's so many there's so many uh
[43:32] things that the world deals with if you
[43:34] work work with people at work uh you
[43:37] talk to your Associates at work at
[43:39] school or wherever or family members who
[43:42] on Believers the the issues and the
[43:44] things that they have to deal with
[43:46] sometimes are
[43:47] shocking the level of mental illness and
[43:50] depression the the levels of childhood
[43:52] Rebellion the the levels of marriage
[43:54] issues and struggles and
[43:56] it's
[43:58] astronomical and and we say well we
[44:01] don't deal with all those things we all
[44:03] have things we deal with we understand
[44:04] that we all have things that come but
[44:06] when you begin to compare it to somebody
[44:09] outside it's it's just a different level
[44:12] altogether and you realize that there's
[44:14] something that God is doing for us
[44:16] that's very very special and we say Amen
[44:18] it's the word it's the effect of the
[44:20] word it is it's the effect of the word
[44:21] but having a local church and coming
[44:23] together is also the effect of the word
[44:26] all works together the the word is
[44:28] affected in our lives and it's affecting
[44:30] us and it's helping us amen we're we're
[44:32] we're coming together and bringing
[44:34] prayer requests together and brother B
[44:36] said if you got these prayer requests
[44:37] write them down lay them up here in the
[44:38] desk and let the song leader whoever
[44:39] read them and pray together over them
[44:41] and see what God will do amen it's
[44:43] simple it's not complicated he didn't
[44:45] make it complicated he says when you're
[44:48] gathered together in this atmosphere
[44:50] amen We've Come Together according to
[44:52] the word and there's needs in the body
[44:54] present those needs back to the body
[44:56] when the body agrees together in prayer
[44:58] amen see what God will do and we see it
[45:00] over and over and over and it's so
[45:03] simple it's just become
[45:05] expected is that right and it's simple
[45:08] obedience to the instructions of a
[45:09] prophet and faith in God's word I mean
[45:11] it's just very very simple it's not
[45:14] complicated amen you don't have to work
[45:17] ourselves into a fevered pitch we don't
[45:19] have to have an allight prayer meeting
[45:21] don't there's anything wrong with that
[45:23] but it's the Simplicity of being
[45:25] gathered together Harmony and unity
[45:27] focused on the same thing and there's a
[45:28] need in the body the needs presented the
[45:30] body prays about it together simple it
[45:32] may take 2 minutes amen it's over with
[45:34] and then the prayer requests start
[45:35] rolling in I was delivered I was healed
[45:38] I I the my doctor said they can't find
[45:40] it anymore how many times do you find
[45:42] that the level of malpractice Among Us
[45:44] is absolutely a misdiagnosis is
[45:47] astronomical I wonder if it's the same
[45:49] rates that everybody else experiences
[45:51] how many times the doctor says we got to
[45:53] do more tests I see a shadow I see a
[45:55] spot this looks bad I'm really detecting
[45:57] cancer I'm thinking this and we do the
[45:59] simple Act of just writing out a little
[46:01] T somebody just simply speaking and
[46:03] simply pray nothing I mean listen we
[46:05] don't shoot off
[46:08] fireworks we don't you know really work
[46:10] it up with the
[46:12] music just the
[46:14] Simplicity of agreeing together as a
[46:16] body and then we get another testimony I
[46:18] went back for further test I had an MRI
[46:21] the CAT scan was scary the MRI says
[46:23] there's nothing they can't find a thing
[46:25] and you think there's a lot of bad MRI
[46:27] machines around Lio Ohio bad CAT scans
[46:29] or whatever CT scans or are bad rate no
[46:33] I I I think there's something
[46:35] Supernatural taking place in the
[46:37] Simplicity of a local
[46:39] [Applause]
[46:41] body the fact that we come together in
[46:44] obedience to the word surrendering
[46:46] submitting to one another and loving one
[46:49] another does a tremendous work you know
[46:52] love is
[46:54] healing right you know when you write
[46:56] out a a prayer request or share a
[46:59] need and all of a sudden you get texts
[47:02] how are you feeling or somebody in the
[47:04] forest says what's going on they shake
[47:06] your hand and say I'll be praying for
[47:07] you this week do you realize that that's
[47:09] also bringing
[47:13] healing you know how many how many times
[47:16] just today I wrote it down in the back
[47:18] just today sh sister Sharon Rass talked
[47:20] about her KNE surgery she's doing well
[47:21] and all the support all the expressions
[47:23] of love the food and all the things that
[47:25] she received
[47:26] amen it's not just that God goes and
[47:29] stitches together and meniscus tear but
[47:31] you know your body amen has the capacity
[47:34] to heal itself but when they know when
[47:36] that body gets under stress and all out
[47:38] of source it starts to affect your
[47:39] immune
[47:42] system so sometimes our healing may just
[47:46] be amen that healing that comes to our
[47:49] spirit and our soul amen that relaxes us
[47:52] and brings us peace and love and unity
[47:54] and Harmony and true friendship and
[47:56] fellowship and it begins to work
[47:57] everything right in our body and allow
[47:59] the healing to
[48:00] move we always think it's one way but
[48:03] but it's more brother brah said God
[48:05] heals through music God heals through
[48:07] nature amen God heals God heals through
[48:12] love God cast out Spirits by love
[48:17] amen amen you know
[48:21] ah it's amazing that the brother B would
[48:24] say things like this because it makes
[48:26] you think different about
[48:28] everything how many times I mean it may
[48:30] not be all the ministers getting
[48:33] together and laying on their hands and
[48:34] screaming in the face of somebody to
[48:36] cast a demon out it may just be the love
[48:38] of the fellowship that starts to move
[48:40] that thing it loses its grip and loses
[48:42] its
[48:44] power we are so free as a people why are
[48:47] we so free why do we have so many
[48:50] testimonies why has God delivered us
[48:52] from so many things Why do husbands and
[48:54] wives get along so well why do children
[48:57] come in harmony with their parents why
[48:59] are we we seeing fellowship and healing
[49:01] and deliverance amen I I think I don't
[49:03] think it's just one thing I can't say
[49:04] it's because we come to church I'm not
[49:06] I'm not going to take that
[49:08] jump but there's something with
[49:10] Fellowship that brings a spiritual
[49:12] strength amen that helps everything else
[49:16] in the kingdom of God work so we don't
[49:19] want to unplug any of it we want to keep
[49:23] everything plugged in to get the full
[49:24] benefit
[49:26] amen amen let's turn to John 13
[49:31] together I still want to keep thinking
[49:33] about this
[49:35] protection of the local church if it
[49:38] could protect a man living in
[49:40] fornication from the whip of God from an
[49:44] evil spirit which would be the whip of
[49:45] God if it can protect a man from that
[49:48] what can it protect us who are serving
[49:50] God with all our hearts
[49:53] from it's amazing to me that honestly
[49:57] when that thing dropped in my heart it
[49:58] blew me blew my mind wide open to
[50:01] everything I said this is amazing no
[50:04] wonder Paul said for forsake not the
[50:06] assembling together of
[50:08] yourselves no wonder when he said when
[50:10] you're to gathered together with the
[50:11] deacons and the elders gather yourself
[50:13] together there's something more
[50:15] happening than in just I'm going to hear
[50:18] a scripture now I understand that Bible
[50:20] verse better there's more happening than
[50:22] just that that's part of it amen that's
[50:25] a huge part of but that's not all of it
[50:28] amen John
[50:31] 13:12 so after he had washed their feet
[50:33] and had taken His Garment and sat down
[50:35] again he said unto them know you what I
[50:37] have done to you you call me master and
[50:39] Lord and you say well for so I am if I
[50:42] then your Lord and Master have washed
[50:43] your feet you also ought to wash one
[50:45] another's feet for I've given you an
[50:47] example that you should do as I have
[50:49] done to you verily verily I say unto you
[50:52] the servant is not greater than his Lord
[50:54] neither he that is sick greater than he
[50:56] that sent him if you know these things
[50:58] happy are ye if you do them
[51:01] amen before this he tells Simon Peter he
[51:05] says I'm going to wash your feet and
[51:06] Simon Peter says no you're not going to
[51:07] wash my feet and Jesus says if I wash
[51:10] you not you have no part with me then he
[51:12] says well don't just through my feet if
[51:14] that's the case do everything I love
[51:17] Peter Peter's a bit of an
[51:19] extremist is that
[51:22] true John's the Apostle of love amen uh
[51:25] Peter's a bit of an extremist he's got
[51:27] that Burly Faith amen and guess what
[51:30] among us we have those that are love and
[51:32] we have some of those that are burly
[51:33] faith we have some that are a little bit
[51:35] extreme on everything they do and some
[51:37] that are a little bit soft on everything
[51:38] they do to some of us everything is
[51:42] wrong and important and must be dealt
[51:44] with
[51:46] immediately for others it's like ah it's
[51:49] not that big a deal it'll be okay they
[51:51] didn't really mean it
[51:53] right right
[51:56] but brother Brenham saw amen that at the
[51:59] end of the ministry God put Faith and
[52:01] love together because Faith worketh by
[52:03] love amen and he brought Peter and John
[52:05] together and they were as opposite as
[52:07] night and day but they needed one
[52:09] another Amen to administer so so in an
[52:13] assembly God has all kinds amen but it's
[52:15] for the health of the entire
[52:18] assembly you got to have somebody once
[52:20] in a while that'll stand up and say what
[52:22] are we doing about this and why aren't
[52:23] we doing anything about it this is a
[52:24] problem
[52:25] yes but you also got to have somebody
[52:27] who says listen it's not as big a deal
[52:29] as you think it's
[52:31] okay they're new they don't know what
[52:33] they're doing they're let's just let it
[52:35] go and you need both because if not if
[52:39] you lean one way or the other in some
[52:41] point you're going to find yourself off
[52:42] the rails one way or the
[52:44] other so thank God for a fellowship of
[52:48] believers who have like Precious faith
[52:50] and they're they're in unity under the
[52:53] headship of Christ but but they're not
[52:59] uniform because uniformity is not
[53:01] necessarily
[53:03] Unity we can try to create uniformity we
[53:06] all only do the same things we only like
[53:07] the same things we only dress in the
[53:09] same things we only wear the same
[53:10] colors we only drive the same type of
[53:14] car yeah not one of you get a sports car
[53:17] that's
[53:20] worldly and if you put a lift kit on
[53:23] your
[53:24] truck
[53:31] praise be to God and if you drive a
[53:34] minivan you're
[53:40] nothing praise God I love it we we're
[53:44] not looking for
[53:46] uniformity we're asking for
[53:49] Unity uniformity brings weakness
[53:53] amen that's right if you build a a stone
[53:56] wall or brick wall and all the bricks
[53:58] are the same shape it's not as strong as
[54:00] if you use mismatched
[54:02] Stone if you use mismatched Stone and
[54:05] they interlock together and you have
[54:07] these odd pieces sticking out and then
[54:09] other other rocks wrap around that odd
[54:11] piece and you've seen stone walls like
[54:12] that when you see that come together
[54:14] that's the way the pyramids are built
[54:16] they're not all the same size and shape
[54:17] Stone amen but all the different stones
[54:21] have come together in unity for one
[54:24] purpose but they're not they're they're
[54:26] not
[54:27] uniform so you look at the Great Pyramid
[54:30] that Enoch built it's not uniform but
[54:32] it's
[54:33] unified there's a there's a huge
[54:36] difference between uniformity and
[54:38] unification yeah amen so we want to be
[54:41] in the unity of purpose we want to be
[54:42] the unity of spirit the unity of mind
[54:45] but in order to accomplish that God is
[54:47] going to put together different size
[54:49] Stones amen because it's stronger that's
[54:52] what makes the pyramid earthquake proof
[54:55] yeah amen other ancient buildings that
[54:57] are built and stone walls that are built
[54:58] this way have survived earthquake after
[55:01] earthquake after earthquake for
[55:03] thousands of years amen and the church
[55:05] Will Survive the earthquakes of this
[55:07] world Amen when God puts all the pieces
[55:09] together and they begin to trust one
[55:11] another interlock together work together
[55:13] in unity and Harmony and love one
[55:15] another and not say you're an odd
[55:19] Stone well I mean that one could turn
[55:21] around and say well you're an odd Stone
[55:23] too but you're your odity here and my
[55:26] odity here are supposed to go together
[55:28] like
[55:30] this sir amen I said before I had I had
[55:34] a a thought one time about marriage and
[55:36] you know those little um uh uh uh I
[55:39] don't know what you call them it's a
[55:40] necklace and they'll have a broken heart
[55:43] and you get two halves one the guy can
[55:45] take one the girl can take and you put
[55:46] them together they're a perfect
[55:48] match you know those two things are not
[55:51] exact replicas of one
[55:54] another where this one has this big
[55:56] piece sticking out this one has an
[56:02] indentation where this one has another
[56:04] piece sticking out this one has an
[56:06] indentation yeah and when you put them
[56:09] together you get a whole unit amen and
[56:12] you're like why is that thing all messed
[56:14] up you know if I was making I would just
[56:17] make it around with a straight line you
[56:18] know that's the way it should
[56:21] look and I would magnetize so you clip
[56:24] them together they go right every time
[56:25] and I would put little guards on the top
[56:26] of the bottom so you can't mismatch
[56:28] it I'm weird I have an oddity amen I I
[56:32] need other Oddities around me to keep me
[56:36] balanced but that's not the way it's
[56:38] made it's made so they have to interlock
[56:40] the hole is only made when these two
[56:41] different parts come together and they
[56:43] strengthen one another my wife has
[56:45] attributes that I do not possess our
[56:48] family would suffer greatly if it wasn't
[56:50] for God putting a father and a mother
[56:53] together with different attributes and
[56:54] amen so that they could express to the
[56:56] kids and understand all the situations
[56:58] in life through these two different
[57:00] visions and the two different Visions
[57:02] come together in harmony not because
[57:04] they see the exact same thing amen
[57:06] because they're serving the exact same
[57:09] purpose to raise these children and fear
[57:11] admonition of the Lord that's what
[57:12] brings our unification not because we
[57:14] always agree on everything and not
[57:16] because we always see everything the
[57:17] same way but we're unified in purpose
[57:19] amen we're not we're not uniform in
[57:23] personality and has made our family
[57:26] stronger am so that's what the local
[57:29] body provides for us if we allow
[57:33] it if we allow
[57:35] it so now sorry I got off the rails
[57:39] there for a minute now we come back to
[57:42] what we call feet washing Peter says
[57:46] Wash Me All I Want It All Jesus says no
[57:50] you're
[57:51] clean but your feet you're all clean but
[57:55] your
[57:56] feet you need not say be washed you are
[57:59] all clean you need not sa washed except
[58:00] thy
[58:01] feet and so he it's interesting that he
[58:05] would say only your feet need to be
[58:07] washed because Jesus told them
[58:08] previously you are clean through the
[58:11] word that I've spoken to you you're
[58:13] clean through the word that I've spoken
[58:15] to you and we know that as a bride we
[58:17] are washed in the water of the word
[58:18] we're clean through the word that he's
[58:20] given to us Washed by the Water of the
[58:22] bleeding word but yet Jesus said that
[58:25] I'm going to have to wash your
[58:27] feet but and then he told him you wash
[58:29] one another's feet he didn't say wash
[58:31] everybody's whole body he said you wash
[58:33] one another's feet and and and when you
[58:36] understand this from the Bible times
[58:38] I've preached it before so many of you
[58:39] understand that when they would go to
[58:41] the bath houses they weren't necessarily
[58:42] bathing in their homes they were bathing
[58:44] in the bath houses and the Romans
[58:45] brought this in and and and the Jews
[58:47] also would take ceremonial bathing and
[58:49] you take come from the bath house amen
[58:51] you're clean but walking from the bath
[58:54] house to the house house you walk on a
[58:55] Dusty Street in a pair of sandals and
[58:57] walking the walk in the world your feet
[59:00] can become dirty but it doesn't mean
[59:01] you're all dirty amen and the same is
[59:05] true for us amen we've been cleansed
[59:06] we've been Sanctified by the blood of
[59:08] Jesus Christ the washing of the water of
[59:10] the word has cleansed us but as human
[59:12] beings we are still walking in a very
[59:14] dirty
[59:16] world and Jesus would now take on the
[59:19] role of a servant and kneel down and
[59:21] wash those dirty Dusty feet amen of the
[59:23] disciples amen because he wanted them to
[59:26] be all clean and he was going to serve
[59:28] this function for them but he says if
[59:30] I'm your master take my example and you
[59:33] do this to one another amen because why
[59:36] because in this life you and I are going
[59:38] to walk through this world and we may
[59:39] pick up a little dust on our feet we may
[59:41] get a little bit manure off the road and
[59:44] we're going to need our brothers and
[59:45] sisters to bear with us and help us wash
[59:47] that off God has left a portion he
[59:50] cleans by the washing of the water of
[59:52] the word amen but he told us to come to
[59:54] feet washing and communion not I mean
[59:57] this water out here is not doing the job
[59:59] it's symbolic amen it's a reminder it's
[1:00:02] it's something for us to do Amen on a on
[1:00:04] a continual basis to remind us that we
[1:00:06] must be serving one another but how are
[1:00:08] we to serve one another by humbling
[1:00:10] ourselves bearing with one another and
[1:00:12] taking the dirt of this world off of
[1:00:14] each other we need one
[1:00:18] another we need to wash one another how
[1:00:21] do we wash one another through
[1:00:23] Fellowship through the word through love
[1:00:25] through care amen we can wash one
[1:00:28] another not just once a month right
[1:00:32] that's just the symbol the reminder the
[1:00:34] the the the the reason for us to pause
[1:00:36] and think about but let's continually
[1:00:38] humble ourselves and serve one another
[1:00:41] amen and let's keep one another
[1:00:45] clean that's the whole purpose of
[1:00:46] provoking one another to love and good
[1:00:51] works
[1:00:52] amen let's go to First Corinthians 11
[1:00:55] this is the other scripture that we read
[1:00:57] many times in
[1:01:04] communion so if there's a service that
[1:01:07] we can do for each other of washing of
[1:01:10] the
[1:01:12] feet then
[1:01:14] there's a strength a power a barrier in
[1:01:20] the body of Christ to keep us
[1:01:23] clean
[1:01:25] and that's our brothers and our
[1:01:29] sisters that's why brother B said every
[1:01:31] Christian needs a home
[1:01:33] church when you get out into isolation
[1:01:36] and get on your own then all of a sudden
[1:01:39] listen this is this is just the truth so
[1:01:42] just believe me am you get separated
[1:01:44] from fellowship and get on your own and
[1:01:46] you can go to the same church and
[1:01:48] separate yourself from fellowship
[1:01:49] because you can get your feelings hurt
[1:01:50] and draw pull away you can sit in the
[1:01:51] pews but still not
[1:01:53] be
[1:01:55] when you do that every thought you have
[1:01:59] now becomes the Holy
[1:02:02] Ghost every feeling you feel about
[1:02:05] something every thought you have every
[1:02:08] decision you make becomes the Holy
[1:02:12] Ghost because there's nobody there to
[1:02:16] sharpen amen there's nobody there to say
[1:02:19] but what about when brother B said this
[1:02:21] or what about that scripture did you
[1:02:24] think about that cuz the problem with
[1:02:27] our perspective is that's our
[1:02:29] perspective right the problem with
[1:02:30] perspective is that's the only thing you
[1:02:32] see you can see there's so many people
[1:02:35] that preach on balance balance balance
[1:02:36] and we know you have to have balance the
[1:02:38] reality is nobody on this planet knows
[1:02:41] if they're balanced or
[1:02:45] not if I have a three Dee
[1:02:49] tilt and then I declare I'm balanced I'm
[1:02:52] judging everybody around me on my 3°
[1:02:59] tilt but I'm blind to myself I don't
[1:03:02] even know that I've got this leaning
[1:03:04] this way I think I'm perfectly balanced
[1:03:07] have a perfect understanding of the
[1:03:08] message my heart is pure I'm completely
[1:03:11] innocent and all of a sudden I left
[1:03:13] flesh behind and don't have a sticky
[1:03:15] cocko nature anymore and cannot amen be
[1:03:18] tilted one way or the other I am
[1:03:19] perfectly in Bound this is the problem
[1:03:22] with pride and this is the problem with
[1:03:24] separating oursel from fellowship
[1:03:26] because sometimes you'll have a three
[1:03:27] degree tilt this way and your brother
[1:03:29] will have a three degree tilt this way
[1:03:31] and you both are looking at each other
[1:03:32] like you're both nuts you're nuts you're
[1:03:34] nuts amen but you have to realize I
[1:03:36] believe there's God in my brother and he
[1:03:38] believes there's God in his brother and
[1:03:40] we're willing to listen to one another
[1:03:41] and realize maybe it's not exactly the
[1:03:43] way I thought maybe there is another way
[1:03:46] to view
[1:03:48] this this is the danger of isolation
[1:03:50] this is danger of leaving
[1:03:53] Fellowship
[1:03:56] the other thing that's dangerous is if
[1:03:58] we only have fellowship with everybody
[1:04:00] else with a Three Degree
[1:04:03] tilt then we're all
[1:04:08] balanced what do you think about me
[1:04:10] brother I think you're good what do you
[1:04:12] think about me I think you're good right
[1:04:14] do we look good yeah you look good I
[1:04:16] look good we look good you agree with me
[1:04:18] yeah I agree with you I agree with you
[1:04:20] we
[1:04:23] agree
[1:04:26] I love human nature it's the same across
[1:04:28] the board it's the same for me it's the
[1:04:30] same for you it's the same for the new
[1:04:32] believer it's the same for the one who's
[1:04:34] believed 50 years it doesn't change we
[1:04:37] need each other we need the health the
[1:04:40] strength the support we need the correct
[1:04:43] vision we need iron to sharpen it iron
[1:04:45] we need a friend to sharpen the face of
[1:04:47] his friend the countenance of his friend
[1:04:50] amen we need somebody to help us wash
[1:04:53] the dirt off of our
[1:04:55] feet we need somebody that will bear
[1:04:57] with us in our mistakes we need somebody
[1:05:00] that we can go to and confess our faults
[1:05:03] one to another we need to S we need
[1:05:06] somebody that we can say listen brother
[1:05:08] pray with me I'm struggling to overcome
[1:05:11] this I'm having a hard time with this
[1:05:13] and we need somebody that's willing to
[1:05:15] Humble themselves get on their knees and
[1:05:17] start washing that dirt off of us start
[1:05:19] pouring love and the word on to on top
[1:05:21] of us and say encourage them in the word
[1:05:23] and say the scripture says this and
[1:05:25] brother B said that and I'm going to
[1:05:26] stand with you whether two or three
[1:05:28] agree touching anything God will hear
[1:05:29] from heaven and brother we're going to
[1:05:31] agree together on this and what are you
[1:05:33] doing you're washing that dirt off of
[1:05:35] them and you're helping bear one
[1:05:36] another's
[1:05:38] burdens this is what we need we need a
[1:05:40] body we need Fellowship we need to do
[1:05:43] what God called us to do because we need
[1:05:47] it another fallacy and pride is when we
[1:05:50] come to church because everybody else at
[1:05:52] church needs me
[1:05:59] I mean not even the pastor can take that
[1:06:01] approach not the
[1:06:03] ministry we're not here because
[1:06:05] everybody in the church needs
[1:06:07] me If I Die Tomorrow God will put
[1:06:09] another pastor and it'll move on just as
[1:06:11] good as it's ever moved or maybe
[1:06:15] better we don't we all need to come cuz
[1:06:18] we need to
[1:06:20] come we need the local body not because
[1:06:23] they need my
[1:06:25] gift I got to go they need me I need to
[1:06:28] be a contributor yes we do need you but
[1:06:30] come let's come humble brothers let's
[1:06:32] let's come together and say I'm going to
[1:06:34] church cuz I need to go to church I'm
[1:06:37] going for Fellowship cuz I need the
[1:06:40] fellowship it's amazing how many times I
[1:06:42] talk to people and all they ever do is
[1:06:44] saving everybody else they're saving the
[1:06:47] world I'm doing this because they need
[1:06:49] it and I saw there was a need here and I
[1:06:50] saw that's wonderful get involved under
[1:06:52] need but have you ever realized that you
[1:06:54] have a
[1:06:59] need I need
[1:07:02] encouragement I need my vision set
[1:07:04] straight I need to be sharpened I need
[1:07:08] to hear the word I need somebody to
[1:07:11] challenge my
[1:07:14] ideas amen praise
[1:07:18] God and so we need to wash one another's
[1:07:21] feet and then 1 Corinthians 11 33 says
[1:07:25] wherefore my brethren this is communion
[1:07:27] the Lord's Supper wherefore my brethren
[1:07:30] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:07:33] another this is an interesting quote
[1:07:36] where brother Brenham references this
[1:07:38] and it's in the message ordination in
[1:07:39] 1962 he says we believe that when we
[1:07:42] come together he said Terry one for
[1:07:44] another in other words wait on one
[1:07:47] another the word Terry means to wait
[1:07:49] wait on one another now as has been
[1:07:51] accustomed to us we take the scripture
[1:07:53] in this way way that when we do this
[1:07:55] that was just bow our heads and the
[1:07:57] congregation prays for we pastors we
[1:08:00] pastors pray for our congregation that's
[1:08:02] how we wait on each other by serving
[1:08:04] each other by
[1:08:06] praying you pray God listen to this
[1:08:09] prayer God you forgive my pastor if
[1:08:13] there's anything in his life that they
[1:08:15] have done you forgive them for it
[1:08:17] forgive them they didn't mean to do
[1:08:20] it and we come right back to Pastor's
[1:08:23] pray for our congregation God this is
[1:08:25] the little flock that you give us to
[1:08:27] watch over if there's anything wrong in
[1:08:28] their life take it away father so we can
[1:08:31] all Stand Together around Fellowship
[1:08:33] around knowing that we're coming here
[1:08:35] keeping the order of God and taking
[1:08:37] communion I think it's a sweet time of
[1:08:43] Fellowship right when we come
[1:08:46] together and brother M is referring
[1:08:49] specifically to the Lord's Supper to the
[1:08:51] time of communion and we t one for
[1:08:53] another another we pray for one another
[1:08:55] that doesn't mean you can only pray for
[1:08:56] the pastor Pastor well I'm not going to
[1:08:58] pray for myself so I'll pray for the
[1:08:59] whole congregation we pray for one
[1:09:02] another we hope asking God to wash one
[1:09:06] another forgive one another Overlook
[1:09:07] their sins Lord bring them out of that
[1:09:10] help them through their
[1:09:11] trial but I love the way he says this is
[1:09:14] the time the congregation prays for the
[1:09:17] pastor and the pastor prays for the
[1:09:19] congregation also because the pastor
[1:09:21] needs prayer amen he needs encouragement
[1:09:24] he needs correction he needs Clear
[1:09:27] Vision it's a symbiotic relationship and
[1:09:30] you pray for the pastor because
[1:09:32] everybody in the congregation needs the
[1:09:36] pastor and the pastor needs everybody in
[1:09:38] the
[1:09:39] congregation right we need one another
[1:09:42] we need it's not just God he's broke you
[1:09:45] fix
[1:09:47] him it's God I need that gift to operate
[1:09:53] for me
[1:09:55] because you've you've given five
[1:09:57] Ministry offices by which you Christ
[1:09:59] will minister to me amen and one of them
[1:10:01] is the pastor and the pastor over the
[1:10:03] local church and I need that Pastor and
[1:10:05] for my soul I need that Pastor and God
[1:10:08] would if he's done wrong forgive him
[1:10:09] correct him help him strengthen him
[1:10:11] encourage him because I need that gift
[1:10:14] and he's just a man and he's liable to
[1:10:16] make mistakes he's liable to get the
[1:10:17] wrong idea and God I'm asking you to
[1:10:19] help him amen not just because I know
[1:10:22] he's messed up and he needs me and I'm
[1:10:24] going to pray for him no that's that's
[1:10:26] pride humility will come down and say
[1:10:28] God would you please help him he's just
[1:10:29] a human being there's a potential that
[1:10:31] he could have done wrong or said wrong
[1:10:33] would you overlook it will you forgive
[1:10:34] him will you help him repent and would
[1:10:36] you encourage him and would you
[1:10:37] strengthen him and would you give him
[1:10:39] greater Revelation he's ever had before
[1:10:41] because I need that gift for my
[1:10:44] soul because we have to have one another
[1:10:48] that's why for me I I personally I don't
[1:10:52] believe this is a personal thing so
[1:10:54] please don't make a Doctrine out of it I
[1:10:57] don't believe it's a healthy thing when
[1:10:59] a pastor does not need the ties of the
[1:11:01] congregation to live when he's
[1:11:03] independently wealthy and he works for
[1:11:05] his own wages I don't think that's
[1:11:06] healthy amen because in the reality in
[1:11:09] the natural the shepherd lives from the
[1:11:11] Sheep the wool makes his clothes they
[1:11:13] have food for meat uh the milk uh for
[1:11:16] for food and the meat for food he lives
[1:11:18] off the Sheep but the Sheep Survive by
[1:11:21] the shepherd there must be a need both
[1:11:24] ways and whenever one doesn't need the
[1:11:26] other we're setting ourselves up for a
[1:11:28] very dangerous situation if the shepherd
[1:11:31] doesn't need the Sheep dangerous if the
[1:11:33] Sheep don't need the shepherd
[1:11:35] dangerous so we have to have the right
[1:11:38] attitude and say we have to have each
[1:11:40] other I need you and you need me we need
[1:11:44] each other we need every office Amen to
[1:11:46] be filled with with a holy ghost filled
[1:11:48] man and we need to pray for them we need
[1:11:50] our Sunday school teachers we song
[1:11:51] leaders our musicians we need everybody
[1:11:54] and everybody needs one another amen
[1:11:57] we're not we never come to a place where
[1:11:59] I don't need that anymore we got to have
[1:12:01] each other in every gift and operation
[1:12:04] and everybody contributing one way or
[1:12:07] another amen and so we need to pray but
[1:12:12] we need to pray the right way we need to
[1:12:14] pray with humility and with love and in
[1:12:17] unity
[1:12:19] amen amen and I would really appreciate
[1:12:22] the prayers it would do me a world of
[1:12:25] good
[1:12:29] amen in Ephesians chapter
[1:12:32] 5 verse
[1:12:44] 21 Ephesians
[1:12:48] 5:21 says submitting yourselves one to
[1:12:52] another in the fear of God Amen
[1:12:56] submitting yourselves one to
[1:12:59] another you know when we come into
[1:13:01] fellowship and a body of Believers
[1:13:03] there's actually a submission to one
[1:13:05] another that takes
[1:13:07] place because we don't all have the same
[1:13:10] personalities we don't all view things
[1:13:12] the same way we don't all react in
[1:13:14] situations the same way and because of
[1:13:17] that there will always always always be
[1:13:22] differences always
[1:13:24] you know one of the most complicated
[1:13:26] things for me as a pastor I'm giving you
[1:13:28] secret
[1:13:29] Insight is when two people come with a
[1:13:33] solution for the same problem and they
[1:13:35] have two opposite ideas of what we
[1:13:38] should do to correct the problem and I
[1:13:41] believe with all my heart both of them
[1:13:43] are Spirit-filled baptized with the Holy
[1:13:45] Ghost filled with the Holy Ghost genuine
[1:13:47] believers who love the word and know the
[1:13:50] messag and they both believe they've
[1:13:52] heard from God yes and they both believe
[1:13:55] they have the Holy
[1:13:56] Ghost I'm like God what kind of trap is
[1:14:01] this it's not like you can say well he's
[1:14:03] not a Believer no they're equally
[1:14:05] Believers in my eyes equally I believe
[1:14:07] they have the Holy Ghost and are led by
[1:14:09] the spirit of God and they come to me
[1:14:12] this is a problem this is a problem what
[1:14:13] do you think what do you think I think
[1:14:14] we should do this the other one says
[1:14:15] complete
[1:14:17] opposite and I'm
[1:14:20] saying that will always be where you
[1:14:24] have people that's why brother BR said
[1:14:26] God never sends two Major Prophets on
[1:14:28] Earth at the same time because they
[1:14:30] would have disagreement Major Prophets
[1:14:33] would have disagreement you mean two
[1:14:35] Major Prophets could have disagreement
[1:14:37] yes because there's still a human
[1:14:39] element those m one of those Major
[1:14:42] Prophets didn't have the Holy
[1:14:45] Ghost it's always going to be there
[1:14:48] friends it will always be there that's
[1:14:50] why we must submit ourselves one to
[1:14:52] another and humble our ourselves with
[1:14:53] one another because it's not always
[1:14:56] going to be according to our thinking
[1:14:57] it's not always going to be right and
[1:14:59] sometimes decisions will be made that
[1:15:00] we're in disagreement with but we must
[1:15:02] humble and submit ourselves because
[1:15:05] there's no way to have a body of
[1:15:06] Believers in unity of faith without
[1:15:08] submission to one
[1:15:10] another there's no way it's not possible
[1:15:13] because I there's no way if God could
[1:15:15] not get two Major Prophets to agree on
[1:15:17] everything he's never going to get amen
[1:15:20] 200 or 300 Believers to agree on
[1:15:22] everything do agree on that no maybe one
[1:15:25] of you disagree
[1:15:28] but you understand we must submit
[1:15:31] ourselves one to another we must be
[1:15:32] willing to listen we must be willing to
[1:15:34] consider we must be willing to to think
[1:15:36] outside of ourselves and listen to
[1:15:38] another brother and consider what our
[1:15:40] sister and consider what they have to
[1:15:41] say and and realize the validity of it
[1:15:43] and go back to the word and then amen we
[1:15:46] make our decisions based off that and if
[1:15:48] it's not our decision to make we still
[1:15:50] submit because as long as it's not
[1:15:52] contrary to the the word what are we
[1:15:54] going to
[1:15:55] do
[1:15:57] disfellowship over a disagreement of
[1:16:01] administration no we have to submit one
[1:16:05] to another there's a going in family
[1:16:08] there's a ton of submitting to one
[1:16:11] another and it may not be in your family
[1:16:13] but it is in my family we have a lot of
[1:16:15] submitting to one another because
[1:16:17] there's many times we're dead set
[1:16:19] against this idea or that idea and one
[1:16:21] person thinks this is great the person
[1:16:23] think that's the craziest thing I've
[1:16:24] ever heard in my life and there's a lot
[1:16:26] of submitting one to another amen
[1:16:30] because we don't all agree even though
[1:16:32] we share the same genetic gene pool
[1:16:34] mostly we still do not
[1:16:36] agree so we must be willing to
[1:16:40] submit to one
[1:16:42] another and we must be willing to be
[1:16:45] honest with
[1:16:46] ourselves and say is that the word or is
[1:16:49] that my opinion of the word you go right
[1:16:53] cuz many times so many things got fought
[1:16:55] over and splits happened and it came
[1:16:57] down to a matter of opinion amen it
[1:17:00] wasn't either one was off the word yeah
[1:17:02] and either decision wouldn't have been
[1:17:04] off the word yeah but we all have
[1:17:06] different makeups different backgrounds
[1:17:08] we come through different things and we
[1:17:09] all view the word through our
[1:17:13] glasses and so we must submit ourselves
[1:17:15] to one another and I don't mean just
[1:17:17] rolling over and letting things go off
[1:17:18] the word I'm not talking about that I
[1:17:20] hope you understand that the word is the
[1:17:22] word and the word Supreme and trumps
[1:17:24] everything
[1:17:25] else everything else our ideas our
[1:17:29] preferences our Traditions everything is
[1:17:31] trumped by the word of
[1:17:35] God so brother brandom said in total
[1:17:38] Deliverance he said well look what he
[1:17:41] does for us in the in the condition that
[1:17:43] we're in what would he do if we were in
[1:17:45] one heart and one Accord and the only
[1:17:48] way we can do that is unify our hearts
[1:17:50] together with Brotherly Love obey the
[1:17:52] offices of the church and the pastor and
[1:17:54] the pastor obey God then God works
[1:17:56] through the pastor through the board
[1:17:57] down into the church and all together
[1:17:59] one unit to the kingdom of God then God
[1:18:02] will hear when we have a unified
[1:18:06] group let nothing bother you don't be
[1:18:08] dismayed in anything I say praise God I
[1:18:13] want to be one unified group I want God
[1:18:15] to always hear our
[1:18:17] prayer I want to always have an
[1:18:19] atmosphere where God is
[1:18:21] welcome and you know uh there's been
[1:18:24] times we look over the last two years
[1:18:26] and by the grace of God God has brought
[1:18:28] into the assembly by his own doing brand
[1:18:30] new Believers people have never heard
[1:18:32] the message before and he's brought them
[1:18:35] here and and they you know what they
[1:18:37] need they need to come to the word they
[1:18:39] need to have a new birth amen they need
[1:18:40] to come all the way in and I said God
[1:18:42] help us to keep the atmosphere right so
[1:18:45] births can take
[1:18:48] place because we can change the
[1:18:50] Atmosphere by the way we deal with one
[1:18:52] another other by our Harmony and our
[1:18:54] unity and and you could by by by having
[1:18:58] strife and contention and disfellowship
[1:19:00] and murmurings and complainings you
[1:19:02] could kill a brand new believer before
[1:19:04] it hatches out of the
[1:19:06] egg I said God help us never to do that
[1:19:09] amen there's more at stake than just
[1:19:11] what I want there's more at stake than
[1:19:13] just myself amen there's our young
[1:19:15] people need to be born again our
[1:19:16] children are getting older we need an
[1:19:18] atmosphere Among Us that the atmosphere
[1:19:21] is conducive to a birth
[1:19:24] and say God help me never to do anything
[1:19:27] anything that would hinder your spirit
[1:19:30] that anything that would bring
[1:19:31] contention or Strife or disunity or
[1:19:33] disal God stop me in my tracks if I'm
[1:19:36] going to do anything to change that
[1:19:38] atmosphere and make this a place where
[1:19:40] you can no longer entrust us with brand
[1:19:42] new
[1:19:42] babes
[1:19:44] right if God's going to send brand new
[1:19:47] babies along then we've got a tremendous
[1:19:49] responsibility as a people to keep the
[1:19:52] atmosphere right stay focused on the
[1:19:53] word stay in unity and Harmony and love
[1:19:56] one for another and bring that nurturing
[1:19:58] atmosphere until there's another birth
[1:20:00] into the kingdom of God and we have that
[1:20:03] responsibility and we fail on that God's
[1:20:06] not going to send anybody else why would
[1:20:09] God send one of his children to an
[1:20:12] atmosphere that's not right amen it's
[1:20:15] bigger than us it's more about us as
[1:20:18] than than just us as an
[1:20:20] individual brother Brandon you know I'm
[1:20:22] not going to read the whole thing but
[1:20:23] you know in the beginning of Christ is
[1:20:25] the mystery of God revealed brother
[1:20:26] brandom he he he gives an encouragement
[1:20:29] to the church and a warning that you're
[1:20:31] one sweet loving group but Satan won't
[1:20:33] let it stay that way why is Satan
[1:20:35] against one sweet loving group because
[1:20:37] there's so much that's
[1:20:39] accomplished when you're in Harmony and
[1:20:41] unity and love with one another and he
[1:20:43] will try every which way possible to
[1:20:45] disrupt that and brother B said when he
[1:20:47] does when he comes in by whatever
[1:20:49] message method he comes in you draw that
[1:20:51] much closer to together if you see it
[1:20:54] happening don't Clan among yourselves
[1:20:56] don't start talking he said you just
[1:20:57] buckle up the Army you pull the Buckle
[1:20:59] CCH it tighter love one another and at
[1:21:02] the end of this or there's there's two
[1:21:04] things that I want to pull out of
[1:21:06] this he says
[1:21:08] now uh I'm going to start in paragraph
[1:21:10] 84 now you've got tapes on that you've
[1:21:12] got tapes on what we believe you got
[1:21:14] tapes on discipline in the church how we
[1:21:16] behave ourselves in the Church of God
[1:21:18] how we come to how we got to come here
[1:21:20] together and sit together in Heavenly
[1:21:22] places don't stay home if God is in your
[1:21:26] heart you can't hardly wait for them
[1:21:27] doors to open out yonder to get in here
[1:21:30] to fellowship with your brothers if you
[1:21:33] don't don't feel that way then I tell
[1:21:35] you it's time you got to praying amen
[1:21:39] amen take that to
[1:21:41] heart because that goes for all of
[1:21:47] us then further down when he comes to
[1:21:49] the bottom of this he said you just wax
[1:21:52] that much closer together take the
[1:21:53] Buckle as the brother testified a
[1:21:55] minister here the other night about
[1:21:57] having the Buckle seed in the vision the
[1:21:59] buckles on the whole armor of God just
[1:22:00] pull her on tighten up move right up
[1:22:03] close to one another love one another
[1:22:06] anyhow talk nice about one another say
[1:22:09] nice things about one another and then
[1:22:12] God will bless you it's so simple it's
[1:22:16] shocking amen what do I need to get the
[1:22:18] blessings of God and what do we need to
[1:22:20] receive the blessings of God at church
[1:22:21] draw up closer together talk nice about
[1:22:24] each other say nice things about one
[1:22:26] another and then God will bless you what
[1:22:29] is going to start cutting the blessings
[1:22:31] of God off as we start disfellowshipping
[1:22:33] or com into disunity I say God help us
[1:22:36] to resist that because we know that's
[1:22:38] what the devil will try to do in every
[1:22:41] home
[1:22:42] church amen he'll try to do it in every
[1:22:44] family in every home not just a home
[1:22:47] church every home will have to fight
[1:22:49] this off and every home church will have
[1:22:51] to fight this off and the bride body as
[1:22:53] a whole we have to fight this
[1:22:55] off cuz that's what he's trying to do is
[1:22:58] divide amen but brother BR said there's
[1:23:01] a blessing in not allowing yourself to
[1:23:03] be divided
[1:23:05] am let's go to John 13
[1:23:19] now John 13
[1:23:24] and we're going to read verse
[1:23:31] 33 Jesus says little children yet a
[1:23:35] little while and I'm with you you shall
[1:23:37] seek me and as I said unto the Jews
[1:23:39] whether I go you cannot come so now I
[1:23:42] say to you a new commandment I give unto
[1:23:44] you that you love one another as I have
[1:23:46] loved you that you also love one another
[1:23:50] by this shall all men know that you are
[1:23:51] my disciples if you have love one to
[1:23:55] another
[1:23:57] amen I want everyone to know that I'm
[1:24:00] his
[1:24:01] disciple do you want the
[1:24:06] same what was going to be the display it
[1:24:09] was going to be the way we love one
[1:24:10] another that's going to be the display
[1:24:13] to the world so many other displays we
[1:24:16] want but the simplest is just that we
[1:24:19] love one another amen let's keep the
[1:24:22] simple thing
[1:24:23] simple amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:24:37] 12 First Corinthians chapter 12 and
[1:24:39] we're going to read verse 25 and
[1:24:43] 26 that there be no Schism in the body
[1:24:47] but that the members should have the
[1:24:49] same care one for another and whether
[1:24:52] one members suffer all members suffer
[1:24:54] with it or one member be honored all
[1:24:56] members Rejoice with it now you are the
[1:24:59] body of Christ and members in
[1:25:02] particular we are individual members
[1:25:05] that's true but we are part of a body
[1:25:09] and it's just all of my members cease to
[1:25:11] survive when I separate them from my
[1:25:13] body the same thing's true for you and I
[1:25:16] we Thrive by the connection to the body
[1:25:19] we're made to be part of a body we're on
[1:25:22] this Earth to be in the body of Christ
[1:25:25] we're members individually absolutely we
[1:25:28] must retain a certain amount of
[1:25:30] individuality but that doesn't mean we
[1:25:32] separate from the
[1:25:33] body brother M said and who is this mzc
[1:25:36] he said God came down and became flesh
[1:25:38] and died the death in Christ so that he
[1:25:41] could clean the church in order to get
[1:25:42] into it for Fellowship God loves
[1:25:47] Fellowship why is it we love Fellowship
[1:25:49] so much I think maybe because we have
[1:25:50] God inside amen because God loves and if
[1:25:53] God loves fellowship and we be children
[1:25:55] of God and part of God and God dwells
[1:25:56] inside how can we not but love
[1:25:58] Fellowship
[1:26:00] amen God loves Fellowship that's what he
[1:26:03] made the man at the first time for was
[1:26:05] for Fellowship God dwells alone with
[1:26:07] cherubs so what was God even doing when
[1:26:09] he made man God was seeking
[1:26:13] Fellowship in Satan's Eden he says and
[1:26:16] as children of God we are part of God's
[1:26:18] attribute that was in him made flesh
[1:26:20] like he was made flesh so we can have
[1:26:22] Fellowship one with the other as a
[1:26:24] family of God upon the Earth and that
[1:26:26] was God's purpose at the beginning yes
[1:26:28] sir that's what God wanted at the
[1:26:30] beginning what did God want he wanted to
[1:26:32] have he wanted us to have Fellowship as
[1:26:34] a family of God upon the Earth that's
[1:26:37] God's Great desire I say let's have
[1:26:39] Fellowship as a family of God amen amen
[1:26:42] the local body and the global body but
[1:26:45] let's have Fellowship as a family of God
[1:26:48] that's what God wanted that's what God
[1:26:50] made man for that's what God's great
[1:26:52] plan has been unfolding let's have
[1:26:56] Fellowship so if that's what God wants
[1:26:58] what does the devil
[1:27:00] want to break
[1:27:03] Fellowship it's simple it's trying some
[1:27:06] way to break Fellowship that's right to
[1:27:09] break unity and Harmony and do by any
[1:27:12] means that he can to come and break it
[1:27:15] up so we have to as a body of Believers
[1:27:18] fight against that as individuals fight
[1:27:19] against that let's go to Ecclesiastes
[1:27:22] now together all the way back to
[1:27:26] Ecclesiastes which is Psalms
[1:27:28] Proverbs and then
[1:27:35] Ecclesiastes
[1:27:36] Ecclesiastes verse
[1:27:40] 4 I want us to take these things to
[1:27:43] heart as truths out of the
[1:27:47] Bible Ecclesiastes
[1:27:50] 4:9 chapter 4 verse n two are better
[1:27:55] than one because they have a good reward
[1:27:57] for their labor for if they fall and one
[1:28:00] will lift up his fellow but woe to him
[1:28:02] that is alone when he falleth for Heath
[1:28:05] not another to help him up again if two
[1:28:07] lie together then they have heat but how
[1:28:09] can one be warmed alone and if one
[1:28:12] Prevail against him two shall withstand
[1:28:14] him and a three-fold cord is not quickly
[1:28:18] broken even I mean even this natural
[1:28:21] understand standing we realize amen that
[1:28:24] it's best not to be
[1:28:26] alone in the mighty conqueror the
[1:28:29] brother B says I said it reminded me of
[1:28:32] sheep you know when the heat of the day
[1:28:35] is on the sheep all get together and
[1:28:36] they stand against another and they make
[1:28:38] shade for each other and they support
[1:28:39] each other so that's the way the Sheep
[1:28:41] of God should do kind of stand together
[1:28:44] so it places and supports one another
[1:28:46] with our faith and the All Through the
[1:28:49] Bible amen we are called go God's sheep
[1:28:53] in the Old Testament and the New
[1:28:54] Testament were his sheep is that right
[1:28:57] am and also when we come to the message
[1:28:59] of the hour Amen brother brandham calls
[1:29:01] us
[1:29:02] Eagles is that
[1:29:04] true so are you an eagle or are you a
[1:29:07] sheep yeah amen you know my quizzes the
[1:29:10] answer is yes
[1:29:12] yeah amen so so the scriptures all
[1:29:16] through the scriptures and brother R
[1:29:17] talks about it we're sheep we're sheep
[1:29:19] of his pasture he's the great Shepherd
[1:29:21] and Bishop of our souls he's the
[1:29:23] Shepherd that leadth his sheep we've got
[1:29:24] all these scriptures my brother R comes
[1:29:26] along and shows at the end time age
[1:29:28] we're under an eagle anointing and our
[1:29:29] father is Papa eagle and we're the
[1:29:31] Messiah we're the little eaglets amen
[1:29:33] that come forth and so there's a certain
[1:29:36] nature of eagle and there excuse me
[1:29:39] there's a different nature of
[1:29:41] Sheep amen and this is where I want to
[1:29:44] say before uh uh the balance this is
[1:29:47] where I want to talk about a little bit
[1:29:48] of balance amen because we never want to
[1:29:51] lose our individual relationship with
[1:29:54] Christ never never that is also
[1:29:57] dangerous amen that is super dangerous I
[1:30:00] would it's almost as dangerous as not
[1:30:03] having a church but to have a church and
[1:30:05] you give everything over to the church
[1:30:06] and the church is everything and you
[1:30:08] have no individual Revelation no
[1:30:10] individual walk no prayer life no
[1:30:11] leadership from the Lord and you let the
[1:30:13] church be your leadership in every
[1:30:14] matter am mean that's a good way to get
[1:30:16] way off the rails on the other
[1:30:18] side so there is a balance to everything
[1:30:21] and Eagles Eagles fly high can see
[1:30:24] Eagles can move into that prophetic
[1:30:26] realm Eagles can have Vision Eagles can
[1:30:28] see Eagles can be independent Eagles can
[1:30:30] be alone and brother Bram says have you
[1:30:32] ever seen how how independent an eagle
[1:30:36] walks he's not tied to nothing and
[1:30:38] brother man' he starts to describe it
[1:30:40] like this he says won't you come out
[1:30:41] here he says shut your
[1:30:42] mouth I love the way he does
[1:30:45] it when he's showing as a Believer there
[1:30:48] must be an independence amen where we
[1:30:51] can serve God as an individual that I
[1:30:54] can't only serve God when I'm with other
[1:30:57] believers but there's something in me
[1:30:58] connect I have an individual connection
[1:31:01] to Jesus Christ that's that's
[1:31:03] independent from anybody
[1:31:05] else's I have an individual Revelation
[1:31:08] from the father that's independent of
[1:31:10] anybody else's amen I have this
[1:31:12] relationship that's fostered between me
[1:31:14] and him he's got a way of leading me
[1:31:16] he's got a way of showing me his way
[1:31:18] he's got a way of correcting me amen and
[1:31:20] that is between me in him and that must
[1:31:23] always be first that must always be
[1:31:25] foremost that must always stay
[1:31:30] intact but there's always a duplicity
[1:31:33] inside of
[1:31:35] us because you're the sinless Spotless
[1:31:39] virgin bride of Jesus Christ by the new
[1:31:40] birth you've been washed from all the
[1:31:42] sins amen your faith in the word has
[1:31:43] brought you back to your ought to be
[1:31:46] condition but you always have a sticky
[1:31:48] cber nature and you'll always be tempted
[1:31:51] yes
[1:31:52] so which one is
[1:31:55] it they're both
[1:31:57] true so we are eagles we're individuals
[1:32:01] we need individual leadership we need to
[1:32:04] be able to hear from God we need to be
[1:32:06] able to be corrected by God we need to
[1:32:08] have a revelation from
[1:32:10] God but that in no way changes God's
[1:32:15] desire for us to be sheep and part of
[1:32:18] the
[1:32:19] body these two things must dwell
[1:32:22] together
[1:32:23] simultaneously amen or else we've left
[1:32:26] the word
[1:32:29] somewhere we must remain
[1:32:32] sheep we must remain part of the body we
[1:32:36] must be subject to the offices of God
[1:32:39] and to the ways of God but we must also
[1:32:41] have an individual connection to Jesus
[1:32:43] Christ and we must also regardless of of
[1:32:47] what everybody else does I have a
[1:32:48] connection and I have leadership and I
[1:32:50] have a way that God leads
[1:32:54] either one is dangerous if we decide to
[1:32:55] be Eagles and not
[1:32:57] sheep we're going to wind up train
[1:32:59] wrecked somewhere if we decide to be
[1:33:02] sheep without also being Eagles we're
[1:33:04] going to be train wrecked somewhere by
[1:33:06] following some man in some church right
[1:33:07] off a cliff
[1:33:09] somewhere but these two things have to
[1:33:12] come
[1:33:13] together so when I talk about sheep and
[1:33:15] I talk about the church don't don't
[1:33:17] think that in any way we're doing away
[1:33:20] with the individual amen this is what
[1:33:22] the devil's howling
[1:33:23] about is that it's revealed to her
[1:33:26] alone one individual one person amen
[1:33:30] that's that's the whole
[1:33:31] mystery but God wants that one person
[1:33:34] who's got a revelation from God a
[1:33:36] connection with God knows the new birth
[1:33:37] he wants them to subject themselves to a
[1:33:39] local body and submit one to another and
[1:33:41] have love for one another and put our
[1:33:43] efforts together in unity and
[1:33:45] love the strength of the local church is
[1:33:48] the individual connections to Christ
[1:33:51] yeah that's the strength the strength of
[1:33:53] the the strength of the local church is
[1:33:55] that everybody's independently connected
[1:33:58] to Christ amen coming according to the
[1:34:00] word to work together in unity for the
[1:34:03] kingdom of God that's what makes a
[1:34:05] church strong what makes a church weak
[1:34:07] is when everybody's cut off their
[1:34:08] individual ability to hear from God and
[1:34:11] the responsibility to God and they turn
[1:34:13] all that responsibility over to a pastor
[1:34:14] and to a church and they just move along
[1:34:16] like sheep that's
[1:34:19] dangerous but to say I can do it I hear
[1:34:21] from God I've got the Holy Ghost I know
[1:34:23] what's right and I know what's wrong and
[1:34:25] I can do this independently that's just
[1:34:27] as
[1:34:29] wrong why is it the truth is always down
[1:34:32] the
[1:34:36] middle amen and you know I love
[1:34:40] it because there's part of me that
[1:34:43] thrives on my personal connection to
[1:34:46] Christ there's part of me there's depths
[1:34:49] in my soul that nobody can tou touch not
[1:34:52] even my spouse amen and there's a love
[1:34:54] relationship that's independent of any
[1:34:57] other and it's precious to me and I love
[1:35:00] that that God can speak to me he can
[1:35:02] whisper to me he can lead me he can come
[1:35:04] to me I can sense his presence I can
[1:35:06] talk to him I never want to lose
[1:35:09] that but you know what there's another
[1:35:11] part of me that absolutely thrives on
[1:35:14] Fellowship that needs encouragement that
[1:35:17] needs support that needs the correction
[1:35:19] that comes from the body
[1:35:22] I thrive on both and both make me
[1:35:27] alive I don't want to do without either
[1:35:30] brother Bram said it this way in the
[1:35:32] Good Shepherd of the sheep he says sheep
[1:35:34] are funny little creatures in one way
[1:35:37] here's another thing we might learn of
[1:35:38] sheep tonight when the weather is really
[1:35:40] hot did you ever see sheep they won't
[1:35:42] separate themselves and one be at one
[1:35:44] place and one at the other but Right In
[1:35:45] the Heat of the day the Sheep will all
[1:35:46] stand together you know what they're
[1:35:48] doing they're making shade one for the
[1:35:50] other they're having
[1:35:53] Fellowship what does Fellowship do it
[1:35:55] makes shade for one we're helping each
[1:35:57] other and protecting each other from the
[1:35:59] scorching rays of the Sun from the heat
[1:36:01] of
[1:36:02] Trials amen and you know that's the
[1:36:05] truth when we're going through a trial
[1:36:07] just the fellowship takes the pressure
[1:36:10] off just somebody to understand somebody
[1:36:12] to love you and pray with you and talk
[1:36:14] with you about it and and somebody to
[1:36:15] care about all of a sudden starts to
[1:36:17] take the intensity away from The
[1:36:19] Trial amen said he said' and wouldn't it
[1:36:23] be good if um if all God's sheep when
[1:36:26] the heat was on would stand together
[1:36:28] when the trials are real hard and the
[1:36:29] heat is on and everything going on
[1:36:31] everywhere if all of God's Little Sheep
[1:36:33] would just stand together we'd have the
[1:36:35] coolness of the shade of each other the
[1:36:36] Comfort to lean upon each other now
[1:36:39] someone said is that necessary brother
[1:36:41] brandom it certainly
[1:36:43] is now listen I'm not doing away with
[1:36:46] individuality but the prophet said this
[1:36:48] is necessary
[1:36:50] amen and he goes on he says he said it
[1:36:53] certainly is and then the next statement
[1:36:54] is this there's nothing like having a
[1:36:57] real good Dependable friend that when
[1:37:00] the troubles are blazing the heat is on
[1:37:02] you can go to this friend and sit down
[1:37:04] and just explain it to them talk talk it
[1:37:06] over in a personal confidence and then
[1:37:08] kneel down and pray together and know
[1:37:10] that this person is a God is a good God
[1:37:13] saved man or woman that you can put
[1:37:15] confidence in oh it's good to do that
[1:37:18] come let us reason together say the
[1:37:20] scriptures come let us stand together
[1:37:22] and I notice another thing when I see
[1:37:24] sheep in cold country and when all the
[1:37:27] Sheep the blizzard comes to break the
[1:37:29] wind all those little sheep will come
[1:37:30] from one side of the field to the other
[1:37:32] huddle up together and keeps each other
[1:37:35] warm the warmth from each body helps
[1:37:38] warm the other and I think when the
[1:37:40] church gets real cold and indifferent
[1:37:42] God's sheep ought to kind of huddle up
[1:37:44] together and pray for each other and
[1:37:46] then the warmth of real good Christian
[1:37:48] Fellowship oh it means so much
[1:37:52] much brother Simon Abbott you know he's
[1:37:54] a sheep farmer he was telling me they
[1:37:56] had a storm blowing one day and they
[1:37:58] went out to find the sheep and they
[1:37:59] found all the Sheep huddled together
[1:38:01] with their backsides towards the wind
[1:38:04] and the older sheep were out front and
[1:38:05] on the outside and the younger sheep on
[1:38:07] the inside and they they were absolutely
[1:38:10] stopping the effect of the storm and the
[1:38:11] wind for those Little Sheep amen and we
[1:38:13] know that bees in the winter will
[1:38:15] cluster together and they're swarm and
[1:38:17] they'll keep each other warm amen but
[1:38:19] there's some bees that are on the
[1:38:20] outside that are cold and they're making
[1:38:21] heat for those inside but they'll
[1:38:26] rotate after a while they just keep
[1:38:29] moving amen what are they doing they're
[1:38:31] all creating a warm atmosphere for each
[1:38:33] other not one of them bees could survive
[1:38:36] independent of the hive The Hive
[1:38:38] couldn't survive without all the bees
[1:38:40] there's always a symbiotic relationship
[1:38:42] that's how God keeps everything in
[1:38:44] equity he keeps everything in Balance
[1:38:46] because he always has amen there's
[1:38:48] always a need that has to be met by one
[1:38:51] of God's children that keeps us in
[1:38:53] Balance the fivefold ministry needs each
[1:38:55] other all the gifts need each other amen
[1:38:57] a pastor in a congregation need each
[1:38:59] other amen this symbiotic relationship
[1:39:02] and God keeps everything in equity and
[1:39:05] when you take that away you've unbalance
[1:39:07] the program of God you've ruined God's
[1:39:09] equity and now you're independent
[1:39:11] isolated on your own and don't need
[1:39:14] nobody I was reading a book that another
[1:39:16] pastor friend gave me on a Shepherd a
[1:39:18] Shepherd was wrote this book he was a
[1:39:20] Christian man and he just insights into
[1:39:22] watching sheep all those years and he
[1:39:24] would say every year they would have to
[1:39:26] take the sheep and Shear the sheep and
[1:39:28] it was kind of traumatic for the Sheep
[1:39:29] they would get crowed together you would
[1:39:31] wash them and dip them and and Shear
[1:39:33] them and there's a bunch of noise and
[1:39:35] and it was not too easy and and and when
[1:39:37] they knew this time was coming they
[1:39:38] would try to get away he said every once
[1:39:41] in a while you get a rogue sheep usually
[1:39:44] a
[1:39:45] male and he would go off and be
[1:39:47] independent he wouldn't come in for
[1:39:49] shearing time and he would go Rogue and
[1:39:51] he would go out there and he would start
[1:39:53] wondering and he would live in isolation
[1:39:55] and somehow he would avoid the Wolves
[1:39:57] and the Cougars and all of that and this
[1:40:00] he tells the story of one that he saw
[1:40:02] year after year when it comes shearing
[1:40:03] time amen he would go gather the sheep
[1:40:05] and and then this one he would make an
[1:40:07] appearance every once in a while he
[1:40:08] would see him and he would call to him
[1:40:11] he wouldn't come they would try to chase
[1:40:12] him down he ran
[1:40:14] away
[1:40:16] right and that
[1:40:18] sheep if I could just enter the mind of
[1:40:20] a sheep
[1:40:22] yeah which I don't know that I have this
[1:40:26] right but didn't want to be
[1:40:30] sheared didn't want to be subject to the
[1:40:33] shepherd didn't want to go along with
[1:40:34] all the other sheep yes maybe he had a
[1:40:37] painful experience in a shearing one
[1:40:40] time maybe he got frightened as a little
[1:40:43] lamb I don't know why but for some
[1:40:45] reason he didn't want to go along with
[1:40:47] the other sheep under the call of the
[1:40:48] shepherd for shearing time and he went
[1:40:50] off by himself and when he was off in
[1:40:52] isolation he probably thought he was
[1:40:54] doing okay cuz he survived the wolf and
[1:40:56] he lived from year to year he found his
[1:40:58] own gr grass to eat his own and he was
[1:41:00] he was making it yeah he was living who
[1:41:04] can argue with
[1:41:05] him but the problem that year after year
[1:41:08] his wool was getting thicker and thicker
[1:41:10] and thicker and it was getting full of
[1:41:12] sticks and Burrs and mud was drying and
[1:41:16] caking and it was getting heavier and
[1:41:19] heavier and heavier and was becoming
[1:41:21] more debilitated week by
[1:41:25] week but he thought he was fine cuz he
[1:41:27] could find some grass and he could avoid
[1:41:29] the wolf and he finally got so much wool
[1:41:32] that I don't think a wolf could bite
[1:41:37] through finally he got to where he
[1:41:40] couldn't run away from the shepherd and
[1:41:41] the shepherd caught him and he and he
[1:41:44] took him and he sheared him and when
[1:41:46] they weighed that fleece I don't
[1:41:48] remember what the weight was so you have
[1:41:50] to forgive me
[1:41:51] but that little sheep was carrying an
[1:41:54] incredible amount of weight an
[1:41:57] unbelievable amount I think it was more
[1:41:59] than his body
[1:42:02] weight and all because he was avoiding
[1:42:05] the Fellowship of the sheep and the
[1:42:09] shepherd whatever for whatever reason he
[1:42:11] didn't want sheared for whatever reason
[1:42:13] he wanted to go off with his own and
[1:42:16] though it looks okay for a while it's
[1:42:18] not okay because God made sheep to need
[1:42:21] a shepherd and he made a Shepherd to
[1:42:23] need
[1:42:25] sheep we and the Sheep need each other
[1:42:28] we're never going to escape this
[1:42:30] principle in
[1:42:32] God we need it we need it and so he may
[1:42:37] have been strong he may have been
[1:42:39] determined obviously he was he fought
[1:42:41] off whatever dangers were out there he
[1:42:43] must have had a strong
[1:42:45] Constitution as a sheep but in the end
[1:42:49] he would have died without the inter
[1:42:50] intervention of the
[1:42:52] shepherd we have to realize that God
[1:42:55] knows what he's doing and what he has
[1:42:57] set up is right his program is correct
[1:43:01] and he's asking us just to submit to it
[1:43:03] and if we submit to it there's a
[1:43:05] blessing and there's
[1:43:07] protection amen amen so we have to stay
[1:43:11] independent in one side and we have to
[1:43:14] remain dependent on the other
[1:43:19] side
[1:43:21] brother B
[1:43:22] said we know this really well he said if
[1:43:26] the spirit of God is in me that is the
[1:43:29] spirit of Christ then I'll I'll make my
[1:43:31] conduct like him make any Christian like
[1:43:33] him on top of that is he has given us a
[1:43:36] spiritual gift or his presence near then
[1:43:38] he will be just like he was then he
[1:43:41] could go right straight see he has no
[1:43:43] lips on Earth but mine ours no hands but
[1:43:47] ours our eyes he speaks through us he
[1:43:49] looks through us and he sees through US
[1:43:55] am now you see why you need the
[1:43:59] body Jesus said to his disciples look
[1:44:03] unto the
[1:44:04] Harvest it is white unto Harvest pray
[1:44:08] the Lord of the Harvest that he'll send
[1:44:09] laborers into the
[1:44:11] Harvest brother said he was the lord of
[1:44:14] the
[1:44:16] Harvest he could see but he's asking his
[1:44:20] disciples to use their
[1:44:22] eyes you see the
[1:44:25] need look into the Harvest you see the
[1:44:29] need and then you ask me to send
[1:44:33] laborers into the Harvest this is where
[1:44:35] brother Bon God put yeah God put himself
[1:44:38] in partnership with
[1:44:40] man he does nothing unless he does it
[1:44:42] through
[1:44:43] man and God is working through his body
[1:44:49] and if you want the full benefit of the
[1:44:51] life of Jesus Christ then you need the
[1:44:54] benefit of his
[1:44:57] body you may be a member but you're this
[1:45:00] amen and you need the rest of this to
[1:45:02] help this
[1:45:03] survive
[1:45:08] amen amen Ephesians 5:30 I'll just quote
[1:45:12] it to you says for we are members of his
[1:45:14] body of his flesh and of his
[1:45:17] bones that means I want
[1:45:21] all of Christ that means I must want you
[1:45:25] to I can't disfellowship you and brother
[1:45:28] B says this and the Mighty God unveil
[1:45:30] before us
[1:45:32] said this is the the story of the little
[1:45:34] boy you know it really well storms going
[1:45:36] on he calls up mama and she tries to
[1:45:39] encourage him she says now you must bear
[1:45:41] this in mind we go to church constantly
[1:45:43] we read the Bible we pray we are a
[1:45:45] Christian family we believe in God we
[1:45:47] believe that the storm whatever goes on
[1:45:49] God is our protection
[1:45:51] do you know what she was imploring him
[1:45:53] his individual
[1:45:55] Faith you're a Christian we go to church
[1:45:58] you know God protected you're okay
[1:46:00] you're fine up here in the bedroom by
[1:46:02] yourself don't worry about it you've got
[1:46:04] faith and then the little boy says mama
[1:46:06] I believe every bit of that but said
[1:46:09] when the lightning is so close that I
[1:46:11] want a god with skin on it and brother V
[1:46:14] said I think not only Junior but all of
[1:46:16] us feel that way when we get together
[1:46:19] when we pray one for another god with
[1:46:21] skin on
[1:46:23] it oh that mother was
[1:46:25] logical that mother was right she was
[1:46:29] saying Sunny you're perfectly safe in
[1:46:31] your bed nothing's going to harm you
[1:46:33] amen We Know listen we could take up the
[1:46:36] same language we know that nothing has
[1:46:38] happened in the life of a Believer
[1:46:39] unless it first cross God's desk and he
[1:46:41] signed off the clock's ticking right on
[1:46:43] time you're perfectly fine you're
[1:46:45] perfectly safe there's nothing to worry
[1:46:47] about God loves you we're Believers we
[1:46:49] believe in the Bible we're Christians
[1:46:51] and you just go over there and tend to
[1:46:52] that yourself you're fine but no he said
[1:46:55] I want to I know I believe it it's all
[1:46:57] true but I when the Lightning's flashing
[1:46:59] that close I just want a god with skin
[1:47:01] on it and brother brandom didn't say oh
[1:47:03] he should have listened to his mother he
[1:47:04] said no not just Junior but all of us
[1:47:07] are that way we need one another and we
[1:47:11] need comfort we need encouragement we
[1:47:13] need correction we need direction we
[1:47:15] need one
[1:47:17] another and I thank God that we have one
[1:47:19] another I so thank God that I'm not a
[1:47:22] Believer stuck on the back side of the
[1:47:24] desert somewhere with no Fellowship I'm
[1:47:26] not at a place where my pastor died in
[1:47:28] the church this fellowship and I'm stuck
[1:47:29] in a place there's people like that amen
[1:47:32] who would love to sit in our seat and
[1:47:34] have what we have I don't want to take
[1:47:35] it for granted I want to say God you've
[1:47:38] been so good to me you've been above and
[1:47:40] beyond amen every prayer request there's
[1:47:42] a need amen everybody that goes to the
[1:47:44] hospital amen the Believers gather
[1:47:46] around they send cars they send meals
[1:47:49] they show love pray praise be to God
[1:47:51] that we're
[1:47:53] here and not just we're here I want to
[1:47:56] be one of those that contribute to this
[1:47:58] great move of
[1:48:01] God Amen Jesus told his disciples he
[1:48:06] said I not just pray he's praying to God
[1:48:08] he said I don't just pray for them but I
[1:48:10] pr pray for them that will believe
[1:48:12] through their
[1:48:13] word so now all of a sudden God's going
[1:48:15] to come through them and then he tells
[1:48:18] them in Mark 16 go you and the world
[1:48:20] Amen preaching the gospel baptizing
[1:48:23] those that believe and these signs shall
[1:48:25] follow them that believe they shall cast
[1:48:27] out Devils they should speak with new
[1:48:29] tongues they should uh uh uh pick up
[1:48:31] serpents and not harm them they should
[1:48:33] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:48:37] recover that scripture still good today
[1:48:41] amen and sometimes what we need is a
[1:48:43] brother or sister with God on the inside
[1:48:45] god with skin on it I need God's
[1:48:49] hands Amen to fulfill that scripture to
[1:48:52] boost my faith so that I can claim my
[1:48:54] promise amen where are God's hands
[1:48:56] they're in the body he has no hands but
[1:49:00] my hands no feet no mouth no eyes but my
[1:49:03] eyes amen I'm here to see the need to be
[1:49:06] an agent an ambassador an agent for
[1:49:09] Christ to see the need and implore God
[1:49:11] for my brother's need because he said
[1:49:13] look on the Harvest look on the needed
[1:49:15] and pray I have his eyes amen
[1:49:21] what am I going to do with his eyes when
[1:49:23] I see that there's a
[1:49:25] need then I'm going to use his
[1:49:28] mouth and ask for the promise to be
[1:49:31] fulfilled in my brother and sister
[1:49:33] because that's his body
[1:49:37] working I'm going to lay my hands which
[1:49:40] are Christ
[1:49:42] hands on the
[1:49:44] believer to Quicken the faith that's
[1:49:46] inside of them to believe the promise
[1:49:49] amen amen it's the body of
[1:49:54] Christ you know we pray I I've I can say
[1:49:58] I
[1:49:59] pray I say Pro so many
[1:50:02] times God I don't know what to do
[1:50:05] sometimes you feel like job I don't know
[1:50:07] where he's at I know he's near I look
[1:50:11] behind and he's not there to the right I
[1:50:13] can see where he's been working but he's
[1:50:14] not there to the I don't know where he's
[1:50:17] at but listen this is a different day
[1:50:20] than that
[1:50:21] day he said oh if I could go to his
[1:50:24] house and knock on his
[1:50:27] door but that was a different day than
[1:50:30] this day now I know where he lives I
[1:50:33] know where his door is I know the body
[1:50:36] that he's in I know who is Flesh and
[1:50:39] Bones of him and I can go amen and be in
[1:50:43] the presence of God we seek the presence
[1:50:45] of God and seek the presence of God and
[1:50:47] we're surrounded by the presence of God
[1:50:49] and he's the Mighty God unveiled before
[1:50:52] us but the presence of God goes
[1:50:55] unrecognized he's in his body he's here
[1:50:59] in our midst he's ministering through
[1:51:01] these hands through these mouth through
[1:51:03] these eyes he's ministering back and
[1:51:05] forth one another he's giving love he's
[1:51:08] giving Fellowship he's giving correction
[1:51:10] he's giving Aid he's giving all kinds
[1:51:12] where is he he's Among
[1:51:15] Us don't
[1:51:17] let don't let the Pres of God go
[1:51:21] unrecognized we call out for his
[1:51:24] presence and call out for a solution and
[1:51:26] call out for a miracle and the body is
[1:51:29] all around fulfilling that cry and we
[1:51:31] miss it all the
[1:51:33] time we cry for God to speak and then
[1:51:36] we're talking to somebody in the fourer
[1:51:37] and God comes right down through a
[1:51:39] brother and gives us the exact answer to
[1:51:41] our
[1:51:43] question why cuz that's his body how
[1:51:46] else do you expect him to answer amen
[1:51:51] yes it comes through the preaching it
[1:51:53] comes through the song it comes through
[1:51:55] the
[1:51:57] fellowship amen have a need and somebody
[1:52:00] just comes and calls or texts and says I
[1:52:03] just wanted to encourage you today you
[1:52:04] were on my
[1:52:06] mind am you could say well I just think
[1:52:09] brother so and so is a super Spirit no
[1:52:11] that was Christ using his body to let
[1:52:15] you know he knows where you're at and
[1:52:17] it's okay amen sometimes we just got to
[1:52:20] open our eyes to the blessing that we're
[1:52:23] we're standing right in the middle of a
[1:52:24] tremendous blessing we just need to open
[1:52:26] our eyes and be thankful for what given
[1:52:28] us and soak up everything we can out of
[1:52:30] the very place that God has placed
[1:52:34] us amen realize we realize we're not
[1:52:37] perfect people and this isn't a perfect
[1:52:39] Church there's not one that exists
[1:52:42] there'll always be rubs there will
[1:52:44] always be something that I wish we did a
[1:52:46] little different I always wish we maybe
[1:52:48] we had this in a different way or I wish
[1:52:50] that brother would just shut up
[1:52:52] or you know we're people there's always
[1:52:56] something amen amen so we don't look for
[1:53:03] Perfection because if you do you're
[1:53:05] going to be on the hunt the rest of your
[1:53:08] life what we're looking is for a body of
[1:53:10] Believers that I can come to according
[1:53:12] to the word of God and get all the
[1:53:14] benefits that are there for me and be a
[1:53:16] blessing as much as I possibly can
[1:53:19] because this is God's provided way for
[1:53:22] this age what's his provided way through
[1:53:26] his bride
[1:53:29] body and I want to have my eyes open to
[1:53:31] it and I want to be grateful for it and
[1:53:33] I want to support it and love it and do
[1:53:36] all that I
[1:53:37] can I want to be a mouth he can use for
[1:53:41] my brother I want to be hands that he
[1:53:43] can use for my sister I I want to have
[1:53:46] eyes to see the need of my brother and
[1:53:48] sister and I want to be be able to
[1:53:50] exercise my faith in the word of God and
[1:53:52] I want to intercede for a brother or
[1:53:54] sister because this is his
[1:53:56] eyes amen sometimes you see something
[1:53:59] that nobody else
[1:54:00] sees God gives you special relationship
[1:54:02] special Insight or maybe you've gone
[1:54:04] through that before and you can
[1:54:05] recognize a struggle like nobody else
[1:54:07] can and you see something nobody else
[1:54:10] sees well praise God you he has no eyes
[1:54:14] but your
[1:54:16] eyes now you can intercede like nobody
[1:54:19] else can intered you can pray like
[1:54:21] nobody else can pray for that need and
[1:54:22] you can encourage like nobody else use
[1:54:25] Christ's eyes for Christ body use
[1:54:28] Christ's hands for Christ's body let's
[1:54:30] do the work of
[1:54:33] God brother M
[1:54:36] said oh my
[1:54:38] goodness he says now you see the
[1:54:42] seals when he was in his mediatorial
[1:54:44] work back there redeeming but someday he
[1:54:46] comes forth to get this
[1:54:48] book this
[1:54:51] book the title deed of all creation the
[1:54:54] marriage certificate it's got all kinds
[1:54:56] of names the Lamb's Book of Life he
[1:55:00] comes forth to get the
[1:55:02] book and all that's in the book would be
[1:55:06] him for that's the believer the words in
[1:55:10] the book and the word is
[1:55:13] him amen what are the Believers this day
[1:55:17] they are the words in the book amen amen
[1:55:20] not Black Ink on paper but now Living
[1:55:23] Word living Oracles of God they are the
[1:55:26] mystery that was in that book now is
[1:55:28] alive standing on Earth it's not just
[1:55:31] words on print it's the logos now has
[1:55:34] come down the very thought of God is
[1:55:36] being expressed and the word made
[1:55:38] manifest I mean the thought expressed is
[1:55:41] the word now this bride has become the
[1:55:44] Living Word made flesh what was in
[1:55:47] mystery is now in flesh upon the Earth
[1:55:49] and it is God in the formation of his
[1:55:53] bride all that God was he poured into
[1:55:55] Christ all that Christ was he poured
[1:55:57] into his body his church the
[1:56:01] bride where will we find him he's in our
[1:56:05] midst he's in me that's true he has to
[1:56:07] be in me I can't catch it like I catch
[1:56:10] the flow flu just by coming into
[1:56:12] association with those I must still have
[1:56:13] a personal experience I must still have
[1:56:15] an individual portion of God I must
[1:56:17] still have the baptism of none of that
[1:56:20] takes away from all of that but me by
[1:56:22] myself is just a little drop Amen in the
[1:56:25] ocean but I want to come together where
[1:56:26] there's a great big flood of God working
[1:56:29] together and I want more than just what
[1:56:31] I have on my own I want all the body of
[1:56:34] Christ and I think if we come with the
[1:56:37] right attitude we get the huge
[1:56:40] benefit of being part of that body amen
[1:56:43] and we get the tremendous benefit and
[1:56:46] protection of a local church just by
[1:56:50] being
[1:56:52] subject and spoken words The Original
[1:56:55] Seed he starts he he tells three stories
[1:56:59] in a row to emphasize a point the first
[1:57:03] story is
[1:57:05] Phillip when Phillip is in a a Revival
[1:57:09] meeting and that Revival meeting is
[1:57:11] taking place in Samaria and God an angel
[1:57:14] comes and speaks to him and calls him
[1:57:15] away and sends him into the desert Amen
[1:57:17] to to speak to one eth iian unic and God
[1:57:20] called him away and he went down there
[1:57:22] and he he draws alongside the spirit
[1:57:24] tells him to draw alongside the Chariot
[1:57:26] where the Ethiopian unic is going along
[1:57:28] and he hears him reading out of Isaiah
[1:57:30] and he says do thou understandest what
[1:57:32] thou readest and the Ethiopian unic says
[1:57:34] one of the wisest things I've ever read
[1:57:36] in the Bible from an unconverted person
[1:57:40] he says how can I let some man Teach
[1:57:44] me this unic knew that if I'm ever going
[1:57:47] to understand that God's going to use a
[1:57:49] vessel right
[1:57:51] am and he wasn't ashamed he wasn't one
[1:57:54] who had to get private Revelation on
[1:57:55] everything and knew what nobody else
[1:57:57] knew and I've got it nobody else had he
[1:57:59] wasn't like that he said I'm never going
[1:58:01] to understand this unless some man tell
[1:58:03] me and Philip beginning at that
[1:58:06] scripture preached unto him Christ and
[1:58:08] now brother benam said if the angel
[1:58:10] could direct Phillip why couldn't the
[1:58:11] angel just go to the unic he says
[1:58:13] because the seed wasn't The Germ was not
[1:58:16] in the Angel The Germ was in the body
[1:58:20] The Germ of life was in the body of
[1:58:22] Christ which was on the earth which was
[1:58:24] in flesh which was in Phillip and life
[1:58:26] had to come to life germ to germ and it
[1:58:29] had to come through the
[1:58:31] body that unic needed the body he needed
[1:58:35] Phillip he was not going to he said I
[1:58:37] just want God I want God to give it to
[1:58:39] me if he wanted God to give it to it he
[1:58:41] needed to recognize the presence of God
[1:58:43] when the presence of God came in
[1:58:46] Phillip that was the answer to his
[1:58:48] prayer that was the need that he had God
[1:58:50] was meeting his need through Phillip we
[1:58:52] know it wasn't Phillip it was the spirit
[1:58:53] of God in Phillip but without Phillip
[1:58:55] that's the vessel that carried it
[1:58:58] there and it was the presence of God
[1:59:01] unrecognized well actually that time it
[1:59:03] was
[1:59:04] recognized and he heard what philli said
[1:59:07] and he believed and he said here is
[1:59:09] water what does hinder me to be
[1:59:11] baptized why because he received the
[1:59:14] germ through the body and he wasn't
[1:59:16] puffed up proud arrogant he was willing
[1:59:19] to submit to God's provided
[1:59:24] way the next one is
[1:59:29] Peter right and he comes to
[1:59:35] Peter and an angel comes to
[1:59:38] Cornelius a
[1:59:40] gentile who's trying his best to serve
[1:59:42] the Lord and the angel speaks to
[1:59:45] Cornelius in a dream and the angel says
[1:59:48] unto him
[1:59:50] go into a city called J japa to uh uh
[1:59:53] Simon the Tanner and ask for Simon Peter
[1:59:58] he'll come and teach you what you need
[2:00:01] to know and brother Braham said the
[2:00:03] angel was standing there talking to to
[2:00:08] to
[2:00:09] Cornelius why couldn't the angel tell
[2:00:11] him what he needed to
[2:00:13] know because life didn't come through
[2:00:15] the angel life comes through the body
[2:00:18] because after p cost Christ is in his
[2:00:20] body on
[2:00:22] Earth the many membered body so brother
[2:00:25] so meticulously goes through this and
[2:00:27] spoken word is the Original Seed and
[2:00:29] then he comes to me this is the most
[2:00:31] amazing of them all he comes now to the
[2:00:34] Apostle Paul when he was Saul Saul on
[2:00:36] the road to Damascus amen he meets a
[2:00:38] pillar of fire the pillar of fire says
[2:00:39] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and
[2:00:41] Saul says Lord who are you he said I'm
[2:00:44] Jesus whom you
[2:00:46] persecute so Paul is speaking to Jesus
[2:00:50] amen how many of you want Jesus to do
[2:00:53] something for you you want want Jesus to
[2:00:55] tell you what to do you want to hear
[2:00:56] from Jesus amen Jesus was talking to
[2:00:59] Saul he interrupted Saul and he says
[2:01:02] Lord what must I do he said go into the
[2:01:05] City and I'll send a man that will tell
[2:01:07] you what you need to do why didn't Jesus
[2:01:09] tell him cuz he had to work through his
[2:01:12] body he had changed dispensations and
[2:01:14] now he was working through his many
[2:01:16] membered
[2:01:18] body
[2:01:19] and that is God's provided
[2:01:23] way amen and Paul Saul couldn't sit
[2:01:26] there I mean God knocked him off brother
[2:01:30] said his high horse knocked him into the
[2:01:31] dust the Bible says he's knocked to the
[2:01:33] ground in the
[2:01:34] dust finally humbled and he didn't say I
[2:01:38] don't want to hear from one of those
[2:01:39] wretched Christians you come back and
[2:01:41] you tell if you want me to do something
[2:01:42] you come tell me yourself
[2:01:44] right no if he's going to get it he's
[2:01:47] going to get it God's provided
[2:01:52] way praise God how many times do we pray
[2:01:56] and say Lord just tell me what to do
[2:01:57] tell me what to do if you'll tell me I
[2:01:59] do God show me the way God show me what
[2:02:01] to do I say if you start praying that
[2:02:03] way start looking around for the body to
[2:02:05] have the answer how's he going to give
[2:02:08] you your answer what's he going to do
[2:02:10] and we know God speaks to us all kinds
[2:02:11] of ways God can show us signs he can
[2:02:13] give us dream we're not ruling out any
[2:02:14] of that but neither rule out the body
[2:02:17] speaking back don't rule out out philli
[2:02:19] coming along don't rule out Peter coming
[2:02:21] along don't rule out ananas coming
[2:02:24] along to give the words of life don't
[2:02:28] rule out your prayer being answered
[2:02:30] during the preaching of the word don't
[2:02:31] you dare rule that out don't rule it out
[2:02:33] from fellowship at a believer's house
[2:02:35] when you're sitting around the table and
[2:02:37] a brother says I heard this quote the
[2:02:38] other day have you ever heard this and
[2:02:40] he starts reading it and all of a sudden
[2:02:42] something drops in your heart and you're
[2:02:43] like that's exactly what I was asking
[2:02:45] the Lord about look for the answer to
[2:02:47] come through the body don't don't say
[2:02:49] God you're not speaking you're not
[2:02:50] speaking maybe you're not recognizing
[2:02:53] his presence maybe it's the presence of
[2:02:55] God
[2:02:58] unrecognized we need each other we need
[2:03:01] Fellowship we need a local body every
[2:03:04] Christian needs a home
[2:03:07] church I didn't say it the prophet said
[2:03:09] it but I believe it wholeheartedly from
[2:03:12] looking through the scripture it's
[2:03:13] absolutely the truth we need
[2:03:15] encouragement we need strength we need
[2:03:17] admonition and we still need to maintain
[2:03:19] our personal walk with the
[2:03:21] Lord at the same time I'm so thankful
[2:03:24] God gave us a body of Believers I'm so
[2:03:26] thankful for the Believers that will
[2:03:28] gather together I'm so thankful for
[2:03:30] those who will submit themselves to one
[2:03:33] another to just show throw their
[2:03:35] shoulder to the wheel to just support
[2:03:37] and to love and and to see that things
[2:03:40] move on in unity and Harmony amen I love
[2:03:44] that and I thank God for it it's been a
[2:03:48] huge bless blessing in my life it has

[2:04:02] countenance this Fellowship that we have
[2:04:06] God is using to shape my life and I want
[2:04:10] to say I love you and I thank God for
[2:04:12] every one of
[2:04:14] you Amen in order to come together and
[2:04:17] stay in unity there's personal sacrifice
[2:04:20] we give up our time we give up our
[2:04:21] energy we give up our money but it's a
[2:04:23] pleasure to serve the
[2:04:25] bride there's a submitting to one
[2:04:27] another there's a yielding there's
[2:04:29] giving up our preferences there's giving
[2:04:31] up our DS there's giving up our ideas
[2:04:33] there's giving up our time there's
[2:04:35] giving up our finance there's giving up

[2:04:41] back to
[2:04:43] Christ what I do for my brother I do for
[2:04:47] Christ even those who are not bride and
[2:04:50] not uh predestinated C Gene of God Amen
[2:04:53] when they come to the white Throne
[2:04:54] judgment he said because you did this to
[2:04:56] one of the least of these my brethren
[2:04:58] you've done it unto
[2:05:01] me I say if I've got to surrender my
[2:05:04] preference to keep Harmony if I've got
[2:05:05] to give up amen I'll do it
[2:05:09] am I'll do it to serve the body of
[2:05:13] Christ to have love to have an
[2:05:17] atmosphere where there can be births
[2:05:19] where God can speak where there can be
[2:05:22] anything is
[2:05:24] possible when we come together in unity
[2:05:28] brother Bram said look what can
[2:05:30] happen in the Tower of Babel which was a
[2:05:33] false
[2:05:34] Unity you believe
[2:05:37] that in that false Unity there were
[2:05:42] sacrifices in every false unity in every
[2:05:45] Unity there's
[2:05:47] sacrifices when they come to build the
[2:05:49] Tower of Babel somebody had to give up
[2:05:51] their time to work on it somebody had to
[2:05:52] give up their finances somebody had to
[2:05:54] rearrange their schedule and they had to
[2:05:55] work together in unity to get this
[2:05:57] project done they were
[2:06:00] unified or something evil
[2:06:04] yeah but God said now that they've come
[2:06:08] to this
[2:06:09] Unity they will do all the desire of
[2:06:12] their
[2:06:14] heart that false Unity was so powerful
[2:06:17] that God had to come down and self and
[2:06:19] break it up by separating their
[2:06:21] languages amen if that will work for
[2:06:24] evil what will it do for
[2:06:27] good what will it do when we when we say

[2:07:07] Psalms Psalms

[2:07:51] he says he goes encourages me so much
[2:07:54] that people will drive across the
[2:07:55] country and come and hear me preach
[2:07:57] because what's the point of God giving
[2:07:58] me a message if nobody comes to hear it
[2:08:01] and the same thing for anybody who's
[2:08:03] preaching here every every one of the
[2:08:05] ministers Ministry are so thankful that

[2:08:18] a in a front room somewhere laboring in
[2:08:20] the ministry just pushing to try to get
[2:08:21] the word across but God has allowed us
[2:08:24] amen all the ministers in this church to

[2:08:44] the fellowship and will contribute my
[2:08:46] goodness is the greatest privilege of my
[2:08:48] life

[2:08:50] planted and what I could be doing cuz I
[2:08:52] would have the same gifts somewhere else
[2:08:54] and I'd have the same responsibility but
[2:08:55] for me I thank God every day and I want
[2:08:57] to be more thankful than I've ever been

[2:12:20] an area to work on and there's always
[2:12:21] something that could be done better
[2:12:24] always the problem is if we fixate on
[2:12:27] that yeah we start to say it needs to be
[2:12:31] better could be better sometimes we just
[2:12:34] need to look up and say but what about
[2:12:36] this and this and this and you know what
[2:12:39] I'm going to ask God to help us to do
[2:12:40] better but I'm thankful for what we have
[2:12:44] so thankful I thank God every day for
[2:12:48] for what he's given us I know that if I
[2:12:51] wind up in a time of need I know
[2:12:53] there'll be dozens who would come to my
[2:12:55] Aid I know if I needed prayer there
[2:12:57] would be multiple of you that would get
[2:12:59] on your knees probably instantly when
[2:13:01] you heard and pray for me we don't know
[2:13:03] what a treasure that is we're not alone
[2:13:06] we don't need to be alone amen God has
[2:13:09] brought us together and we should say
[2:13:11] thank you God and never stop to be
[2:13:13] thankful and more than that I don't want
[2:13:15] to just be thankful I want to be a
[2:13:20] contributor man sometimes we hang out on
[2:13:22] the edge don't hang out on the
[2:13:24] edge the blessings are being fully
[2:13:28] engaged and I know there's many reasons
[2:13:30] for that people have been burnt in the
[2:13:32] past they've had bad Church
[2:13:33] relationships they've been and horrible
[2:13:36] things have happened we're not
[2:13:38] discrediting that horrible rejection
[2:13:40] horrible amounts of pain have
[2:13:43] come but that doesn't change the fact
[2:13:45] that this is God's provided way
[2:13:49] because you've been hurt in the past and
[2:13:50] because things haven't gone well for you
[2:13:52] in the past doesn't mean it's okay just
[2:13:54] to stay on The Fringe if you stay on the
[2:13:56] edge you get the edge
[2:13:58] blessing if you come fully engaged you
[2:14:01] get the fully engaged blessing amen also
[2:14:04] you get the fully engaged
[2:14:07] workload that's just the way it is but
[2:14:10] it's the blessing it's more blessing to
[2:14:12] give than to receive it's the symbiotic
[2:14:15] relationship it's giving and taking and
[2:14:17] giving in taking I'd encourage you ask
[2:14:20] God to help you with whatever pain
[2:14:22] you've had in the past if you find
[2:14:23] yourself holding back pulling back and
[2:14:26] not fully engaging say God help me cut
[2:14:29] away Lord any barrier in my spirit realm
[2:14:32] any hindrance that's in me in any past
[2:14:34] pain because God I recognize this is
[2:14:36] your body on the earth and I want to be
[2:14:38] fully engaged and I want to have a place
[2:14:42] where I work together with the Saints
[2:14:44] for the movement of the Kingdom moving
[2:14:46] forward every every Christian has to
[2:14:48] have that kind of place where they throw
[2:14:50] their shoulder to the wheel and they
[2:14:51] work for the kingdom of God I say if
[2:14:54] God's had given us a place let's take
[2:14:56] full advantage
[2:14:58] of you know and that's only for the
[2:15:03] benefit of
[2:15:05] you you know who will benefit most when
[2:15:07] you get fully engaged you
[2:15:09] will not me you will we all benefit from
[2:15:13] one
[2:15:14] another but it's the person who throw
[2:15:18] thems into the plan of God surrenders to
[2:15:21] the will of God becomes a vibrant part
[2:15:24] of a local body they're the ones who are
[2:15:26] going to get the maximum benefit out of
[2:15:29] that we all benefit but they'll get the
[2:15:32] maximum benefit I say let's surrender to
[2:15:35] God's way
[2:15:37] joyfully amen let's sing that song
