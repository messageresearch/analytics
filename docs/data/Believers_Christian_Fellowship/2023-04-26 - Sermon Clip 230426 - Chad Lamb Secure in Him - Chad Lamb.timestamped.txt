[0:00] I love him because he first loved me and
[0:04] now because I love him there's nothing I
[0:07] need to do in the way of Works to earn
[0:09] his love amen or or to or to Merit
[0:12] salvation amen but now because I love
[0:15] him amen now I want to do things that
[0:18] please him not so that he'll love me and
[0:21] save me but because he loved me amen he
[0:24] extended his grace to me and saved me
[0:26] because he first loved me and now
[0:28] there's a reciprocation in my heart that
[0:30] loves him and now my works is not a
[0:34] merit to attain anything in God my works
[0:37] are simply a love token back to him
[0:42] praise God
[0:44] and so now you know we've been talking
[0:45] on this line for uh several Services now
[0:48] how does kills legalism because legalism
[0:51] to me legalism kills Freedom amen
[0:54] because now everything we do we do to
[0:56] get
[0:57] we do because we do out of fear of like
[1:01] I'm afraid of if I don't do this I'll be
[1:04] lost if I don't do this I'll be rejected
[1:05] if I don't do this a curse will come in
[1:07] my life
[1:09] or if I do this I'll be blessed if I do
[1:12] this I'll receive if I do this I'll get
[1:14] and when we when we come that way then
[1:17] there's really no unselfish love
[1:22] because all of our love is based on
[1:25] ourself
[1:27] so legalism is a disaster
[1:31] because if if my wife only did for me
[1:36] because she was afraid I would reject
[1:39] her that she's not doing for me because
[1:41] she loves me she's doing for me for her
[1:46] or if one of my children only comes and
[1:49] does an act of kindness and service to
[1:51] me so that in the next breath they can
[1:53] ask for five bucks to go do something
[1:56] then they never brought me a cup of
[2:00] coffee because they loved me they
[2:01] brought me a cup of coffee because they
[2:02] love themselves
[2:05] that makes sense
[2:07] so now that this the genuineness of
[2:11] Revelation amen takes us back into the
[2:14] genuine love of God that I don't need to
[2:17] do anything to earn his love neither can
[2:19] I do anything to remove me from his love
[2:22] my I'm secure in him
