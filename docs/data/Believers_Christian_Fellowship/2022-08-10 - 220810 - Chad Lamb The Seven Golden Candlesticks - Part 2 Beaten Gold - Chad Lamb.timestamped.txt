[14:19] way from new zealand he and his wife are
[14:22] here visiting some family but he's
[14:23] certainly no stranger he's been here
[14:25] many times so god bless you brother it's
[14:27] good to see you once again
[14:29] man let's look at gen revelations i'm
[14:31] sorry revelations chapter one
[14:33] i want to begin at verse nine i'd like
[14:35] to continue on with the subject of the
[14:37] seven golden candlesticks let's begin
[14:40] here in uh revelation 1 9.
[14:43] i john who also am your brother and
[14:45] companion and tribulation
[14:47] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[14:50] christ was in the aisle that is called
[14:52] patmos for the word of god and for the
[14:54] testimony of jesus christ
[14:56] and i was in the spirit on the lord's
[14:58] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[15:00] of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega
[15:04] the first and the last and what thou
[15:06] seest write in a book and send it into
[15:08] the seven churches which are in asia
[15:10] unto ephesus and under smyrna under
[15:13] pergamus on the thyatira and antisardis
[15:16] unto philadelphia and unto laodicea
[15:19] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[15:21] with me and being turned i saw seven
[15:24] golden candle sticks and in the midst of
[15:27] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[15:29] son of man clothed with the garment down
[15:32] to foot and gird about the paps with a
[15:34] golden girdle now let's jump down to
[15:36] verse 20.
[15:38] read that as well
[15:39] the mystery of the seven stars was thou
[15:41] sawest in my right hand and the seven
[15:43] golden candlesticks the seven stars are
[15:46] the angels of the seven churches and the
[15:48] seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
[15:51] the seven churches amen god bless you as
[15:54] you take your seats and we know that
[15:56] those seven churches represent seven
[15:58] church ages amen so now we see that that
[16:01] one like unto the son of man christ is
[16:04] in the midst of the seven churches or
[16:06] the seven church ages amen
[16:09] amen so we have a picture here
[16:12] of
[16:13] uh of john john here is on the isle of
[16:16] patmos he tells us and while he's there
[16:19] he's caught up in the spirit on the
[16:21] lord's day amen and this spirit on the
[16:23] lord's day is not the sabbath it is not
[16:26] sunday amen it's not a church day but
[16:29] he's been transported into the lord's
[16:31] day which is our day amen so john is in
[16:34] our day and in our day he hears a voice
[16:38] and when he hears a voice the voice
[16:40] speaks as a voice as of a trumpet saying
[16:42] i am alpha and omega so we know what
[16:45] voice this is by how he declares himself
[16:48] i am alpha and omega the first and the
[16:51] last what thou seest write in the book
[16:53] and send it to the seven churches and he
[16:56] names those seven churches so we know
[16:58] who the voice is behind him because the
[17:01] voice declares himself as alpha and
[17:03] omega and that's christ
[17:05] but it says i turned to see the voice
[17:09] that spake with me and being turned i
[17:11] saw seven golden candlesticks so he's
[17:14] determined to see the voice and brother
[17:16] benham in the church age book says
[17:18] something absolutely phenomenal here he
[17:20] says
[17:21] he says he turned to see the voice see
[17:23] he didn't turn to see the person he
[17:26] turned to see the voice
[17:28] because the voice is the word and the
[17:30] word and the voice is the same and
[17:32] christ and the word are the same amen
[17:36] praise god so he turned to see the voice
[17:38] and when he turned to see the voice what
[17:40] he saw was seven golden candlesticks the
[17:43] voice was coming through or from the
[17:45] seven golden candlesticks and he saw one
[17:47] like unto the son of man in the middle
[17:49] of the seven golden candle sticks so
[17:52] christ amen now in the in the end of the
[17:55] ages in the lord's day is standing amen
[17:58] in the midst of seven golden candle
[18:00] sticks fully lit on full display and in
[18:03] this bright form he's now speaking amen
[18:07] this is a picture of christ amen in
[18:10] bright form
[18:11] in the lord's day right there in our
[18:15] bibles
[18:16] praise be to god god is so good
[18:20] amen
[18:21] i want to
[18:23] pull up a power point here
[18:25] frank if you could pull that up for me
[18:32] and i want to let me see here
[18:34] i want to go to this first slide this is
[18:36] what we talked about on sunday when when
[18:38] he comes to the ephesian church age
[18:40] let's turn to chapter 2 and read the
[18:42] first verse in chapter 2 of revelation
[18:45] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[18:46] right these things saith he that holdeth
[18:49] the seven stars in his right hand who
[18:51] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[18:52] candlesticks so the one that has given
[18:55] the message to the seven church ages the
[18:57] one that's giving the message to the
[18:59] ephesian church age is the one with the
[19:01] seven can or seven stars in his hand and
[19:04] the seven and walking in the midst of
[19:06] the seven golden candlesticks and when
[19:07] brother branham comes to this in in in
[19:10] the
[19:11] church age book he recites seven golden
[19:14] candlesticks and he says in exodus 25 31
[19:18] so brother banham immediately takes us
[19:20] to exodus 25 when he begins talking
[19:23] about the seven seven golden
[19:24] candlesticks in exodus 25 is where moses
[19:28] receives the commission from the lord to
[19:30] build the seven golden candlesticks
[19:33] amen let's read that together let's go
[19:35] to exodus 25 and read that together
[19:39] and get this picture
[19:48] exodus 25.
[19:52] and verse 31
[19:56] exodus 25-31 and thou shall make a
[19:59] candlestick of pure gold
[20:01] watch that word pure gold
[20:04] all the other furniture
[20:06] in the in the tabernacle and the
[20:08] tabernacle in the wilderness almost all
[20:11] is made of em wood amen overlaid or
[20:14] covered over in gold showing a union of
[20:17] humanity and deity man and mo and all
[20:20] that furniture is made out of em
[20:22] wood but the candle stick has no wood it
[20:25] is pure gold
[20:26] [Music]
[20:28] he says make a candle stick of pure gold
[20:30] a beaten work shall the candlestick be
[20:32] made his shaft and his branches his
[20:34] bowls his knobs his flowers shall be of
[20:38] the same and the six branches shall come
[20:40] out of the side of it three branches out
[20:42] of the candlestick out of the one side
[20:44] and three branches out of the
[20:45] candlestick out of the other side three
[20:48] bowls made like into almonds with nop
[20:51] and a flour in one branch and three
[20:53] bowls made like almonds in the other
[20:55] branch with a knot and a flower so in
[20:57] the six branches that come out of the
[20:59] candle stick and then the candlesticks
[21:01] shall be four bowls made all likened to
[21:04] almonds with their knobs and their
[21:06] flowers and there shall be a knop under
[21:08] two branches of the same and a knop
[21:10] under two branches of the same and an op
[21:12] under two branches of the same according
[21:15] to the six branches that proceed out of
[21:16] the candlestick their knobs their
[21:19] branches shall be of the same it shall
[21:21] be one beaten work of pure gold
[21:24] and thou shall make the seven lamps
[21:25] thereof and they shall light the lamps
[21:27] thereof and they may give light over
[21:30] against him
[21:32] and he goes on to say let's read verse
[21:33] 38 on and the tongues thereof and the
[21:35] snuff dishes thereof shall be of pure
[21:37] gold of a talent of pure gold shall he
[21:40] make it with all the vessels and look
[21:42] that thou make them after the pattern
[21:45] which was showed thee in the mount
[21:48] so the the pattern for the tabernacle
[21:50] was the pattern of the heavenly vision
[21:52] that moses received when he was on mount
[21:54] sinai and so he was given instructions
[21:57] exactly to make it according to the
[21:58] pattern he was shown so this wasn't the
[22:01] figment of moses's imagination moses was
[22:03] just making a replication of what he saw
[22:06] and what he saw was already a pattern
[22:08] that was set in heaven
[22:11] praise be to god so what he makes we can
[22:13] see by the description it has almonds
[22:16] and knobs and flowers and branches and
[22:20] so we see that it's in the form of a
[22:22] tree amen this seven golden candlesticks
[22:25] is in the form of an almond tree here's
[22:27] an almond tree and we talked about the
[22:29] arm almond is the is the first uh tree
[22:32] to bloom in israel still blooms in
[22:33] winter and it's a sign of the
[22:35] resurrection while everything is still
[22:37] dead it's the first one to come to life
[22:39] announcing that life is coming amen
[22:41] while it's still dead and still winter
[22:43] the petals are five white petals mostly
[22:45] they also have pink five petals showing
[22:48] grace amen because it's only by grace
[22:52] hallelujah so we see that this seven
[22:55] golden candlesticks was fashioned after
[22:58] the pattern that was in heaven moses was
[23:00] given the instructions and he was to
[23:02] make it with almonds flowers knobs and
[23:06] branches amen
[23:08] so we're looking at a replica of a tree
[23:11] praise be to god
[23:12] so sunday we talked about christ being
[23:15] the tree of life amen and the
[23:17] restoration of the bride tree bring the
[23:19] tree of life restored back to him again
[23:22] so
[23:23] we we looked here at john 15. in john 15
[23:26] 4 says abide in me and i in you as the
[23:28] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[23:30] except it abide in the vine no more can
[23:33] you except you abide in me i am the vine
[23:36] ye are the branches he that abideth in
[23:38] me and i in him the same bringeth forth
[23:41] much fruit for without me you can do
[23:44] nothing
[23:45] and this is
[23:47] to me one of the greatest revelations
[23:48] from the scripture that you can ever get
[23:50] is that without me you can do nothing
[23:53] praise be to god if we try to do
[23:55] something without him we'll be an
[23:57] absolute utter failure but he also says
[23:59] with me all things are possible that in
[24:01] him all things are possible without me
[24:03] you can do nothing amen so we must be
[24:06] connected to him and it's got to be his
[24:08] work flowing through us but even here
[24:10] he's speaking of a vine in branches and
[24:13] the branch is bearing forth fruit it's a
[24:15] connection between the believers and
[24:17] christ and the life of christ coming
[24:19] through the branches and bearing fruit
[24:21] amen showing the life that's on the
[24:23] inside is coming through the branch so
[24:26] out of our lives are supposed to be the
[24:28] fruit of the life of christ amen
[24:30] so it goes back to a plant to a tree to
[24:33] a wheat plant to an almond tree to a the
[24:36] tree of life it's these themes that run
[24:38] through the bible amen are consistent
[24:41] all the way through
[24:43] and when we can see the themes we can
[24:45] see the story that he's trying to tell
[24:47] us
[24:48] that he planted a seed
[24:51] and that seed went into darkness and
[24:52] death
[24:53] and through a process he's bringing the
[24:55] seed back through a process and bringing
[24:58] a single seed back to a multiplied form
[25:01] and to bring it back to his garner again
[25:03] this is the story of the whole bible
[25:06] praise be to god
[25:11] again in this quote we're going to
[25:12] finish this quote now out of the church
[25:14] age book
[25:16] he says you know the seven golden
[25:18] candlesticks in exodus 25 31 says thou
[25:20] shall make a candlestick of pure gold of
[25:22] beaten work shall the candlestick be
[25:24] made his shafts and his branches his
[25:26] bowls as knobs as flowers shall be the
[25:28] same
[25:29] the true church of jesus christ the
[25:31] bride is likened to pure gold
[25:34] it's a he said make it a a candlestick
[25:37] of pure gold and this is how brother
[25:40] branham interprets the pure gold says
[25:42] her righteousness is his righteousness
[25:45] her attributes are his own glorious
[25:47] attributes her identity is found in him
[25:51] amen what he is she is to reflect what
[25:54] he has she is to manifest there is no
[25:58] fault in her
[26:01] this is the prophet of god declaring
[26:03] this looking at this seven golden
[26:05] candlesticks knowing that they're gold
[26:07] amen they're reflecting the original
[26:09] golden candlestick which is christ
[26:11] christ now reflected in his bride amen
[26:13] male and female she's come out of the
[26:16] original she must be whatever he is the
[26:18] same as the woman in the garden was
[26:20] whatever adam was she is her name was
[26:23] adam she didn't have another name until
[26:26] she left the word she left adam then she
[26:28] got a name amen but originally in god's
[26:30] economy she was him
[26:33] whatever he is she is she is reflecting
[26:36] him she's a reflection or a counterpart
[26:39] of the male and the two together are one
[26:42] and he called their name adam god did
[26:44] not intend for them to be separate he
[26:46] intended for them to be one and christ
[26:49] and his bride are not to be separated
[26:51] that christ and his bride are intended
[26:52] to be one
[26:55] that's why he said to them that overcome
[26:58] in this last age you can sit with me in
[27:00] my throne even as eyes overcome and sit
[27:02] with my father in his throne amen now
[27:05] amen this throne amen is not a seat for
[27:08] one it's a seat for two and the two were
[27:11] one
[27:13] [Music]
[27:15] he's to share everything even making her
[27:18] a joint heir
[27:21] a joint heir this is why when we're
[27:23] looking in the book of esther in the
[27:25] book of esther amen the king says to her
[27:28] ask whatever you will up to half of my
[27:30] kingdom
[27:32] he was a king over 127 provinces from
[27:35] india all the way to ethiopia amen he
[27:38] all of the inhabited world at that time
[27:41] all of the known world at that time was
[27:43] under his control and with with the
[27:46] whole world in his hands he looks at
[27:48] this little queen named esther starr
[27:50] amen that's come to this position by the
[27:53] ordinance of god and he says to her
[27:55] whatever you want i'll give you up to
[27:57] half my kingdom meaning you have half of
[27:59] everything i have
[28:01] making her a joint heir
[28:05] amen
[28:06] so now
[28:08] he says she is pure gold this the the
[28:11] the bride is likened to pure gold
[28:15] her righteousness is his righteousness
[28:18] obviously brother branham is not
[28:19] speaking of your flesh
[28:22] he's not talking about your fallen mind
[28:24] he's not talking about the hybrid
[28:25] condition that we find ourselves in he
[28:27] must be talking about something that's
[28:29] deeper than all of this amen maybe a sea
[28:32] gene of god down in the soul that that
[28:35] part of us that was meant to be us from
[28:37] the beginning but now because of the
[28:39] fall in the garden everything went
[28:41] topsy-turvy and got all mixed up amen
[28:43] and now what was meant to be us is
[28:45] coming forth in a form that begins to
[28:48] confuse us
[28:51] and we come with spiritual amnesia not
[28:53] knowing who we really are
[28:56] but the message came to break spiritual
[28:59] amnesia
[29:00] and here in the church age book he's
[29:02] trying to break our spiritual amnesia
[29:05] the part of you that is bride is the
[29:08] seed gene of god
[29:10] the part of you that is bride is the
[29:13] gene of god is that soul that's the part
[29:16] of you that he's speaking of now
[29:19] and it is likened unto pure gold
[29:22] her righteousness is his righteousness
[29:26] her attributes are his own glorious
[29:28] attributes her identity is found in him
[29:32] that's why we talked on sunday that's
[29:34] why brother bam comes to christ as a
[29:36] mystery of god revealed and he says he
[29:38] says we have the devil's answer not my
[29:41] idea but his not my word but it's not me
[29:45] but him he paid the price amen her
[29:48] identity is found in him amen her her
[29:52] everything is now in him she says i am
[29:55] him i am in him he has paid the price he
[29:57] has called me he has sent a message to
[30:00] me he has given me of his spirit he has
[30:02] quickened me the life it's not me devil
[30:04] don't fight with me anymore it's him
[30:09] and what he is she is to reflect what he
[30:12] has she used to manifest there is no
[30:14] fault in her
[30:20] she is all glorious within and without
[30:24] from beginning to ending she is the work
[30:27] of her lord
[30:28] and all his works are perfect
[30:31] so if you start denying what the prophet
[30:33] said then you're trying to deny that the
[30:36] lord is working a perfect work
[30:39] and that his handiwork is anything but
[30:41] perfect
[30:43] in fact and her is summed up and
[30:47] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[30:50] purpose of god
[30:54] that is a mouthful friends
[30:57] in her
[30:59] this is the bride the bride portion of
[31:02] christ
[31:03] and i want to say it this way the bride
[31:05] portion of christ because i want us to
[31:07] stop thinking about flesh
[31:10] because this bride portion of christ is
[31:11] to be manifest through the flesh but it
[31:14] is not the flesh this flesh has to be
[31:16] changed
[31:17] the spirit has to go and be no more and
[31:19] we get our right theophany spirit at one
[31:22] point and this body must be changed into
[31:24] a glorified body don't think the flesh
[31:26] anymore talk think of the real you the
[31:29] true you the genuine you which is the
[31:31] you and the soul that's the real you
[31:36] because if we don't understand amen it's
[31:38] the it's the it's the bride expression
[31:40] of christ expressing through amen fallen
[31:43] creatures expressing through vessels of
[31:46] clay amen we start to look at the vessel
[31:48] of clay and we in ourselves have trouble
[31:50] believing what brother banh is saying
[31:52] because we're looking at the wrong part
[31:54] of us
[31:55] we're looking at the part that'll be
[31:57] changed or done away with don't look at
[31:59] the temporal part look at the eternal
[32:01] part and if you look at the eternal part
[32:03] you'll understand what the prophet's
[32:05] saying
[32:07] because he's speaking about that eternal
[32:08] part and that eternal part there is no
[32:11] way to have an eternal part without
[32:13] having eternal life and the only thing
[32:15] that has eternal life is god so if
[32:17] there's an eternal part of you it is a
[32:19] part of god within you
[32:21] [Music]
[32:22] and that part of god is not flawed it's
[32:24] not faulted it's not
[32:26] corrupted it's pure
[32:29] perfect unadulterated his handiwork that
[32:32] he's forming and now displaying through
[32:35] fallen creatures
[32:37] [Music]
[32:40] but i love this
[32:43] in fact in her
[32:45] is summed up and manifested the eternal
[32:48] wisdom and purpose
[32:50] of god
[32:52] how can one fathom it how can one
[32:54] understand it though we cannot do that
[32:56] we can accept it by faith for god has
[32:59] spoken it
[33:01] you don't even have to understand it
[33:04] you don't even have to fathom it you
[33:06] don't even have to be able to put it
[33:07] together you don't even have to explain
[33:09] it you just have to believe that it's
[33:11] true
[33:13] i don't know how it works but i know
[33:15] it's true i know there's something more
[33:17] than my thinking that's driving me
[33:18] there's something more than my emotional
[33:20] realm that's holding me there's
[33:22] something deep in me that wants nothing
[33:24] but to serve god that loves god more
[33:26] than i love anything else there's a
[33:28] reality within me that's more than this
[33:31] part of me that i've i've known all of
[33:33] my life there's something deeper that's
[33:35] been awakened under this message by the
[33:37] baptism of the holy ghost and there's
[33:38] something that i know came from eternity
[33:41] there's something i know that's more
[33:42] than flesh
[33:44] [Music]
[33:45] this this life that's in me is more than
[33:48] what came through my parents
[33:50] through the union of a man there's a
[33:52] life within me there's a reality within
[33:54] me there's a knowing within me there's a
[33:57] faith within me that is more than what
[33:59] was created with an egg and a sperm
[34:03] it's something that come from god
[34:08] she is
[34:09] pure gold
[34:11] pure gold
[34:15] brother branham
[34:16] tells us that
[34:17] gold is a type of deity
[34:20] we know that gold does not corrode
[34:23] and gold does not tarnish
[34:25] like other metals
[34:28] it's a pure element it doesn't have to
[34:29] be mixed with anything else gold is
[34:32] gold and it does not tarnish
[34:36] it does not corrupt
[34:38] let's look at exodus 31
[34:42] moses was told
[34:44] by god that god would anoint
[34:48] a man actually two men a man and his
[34:50] helper he would anoint them and inspire
[34:53] them to make
[34:54] everything
[34:56] that he was told to make
[34:58] and
[34:59] and when he begins to describe that
[35:01] he says in chapter 31 verse 1 and the
[35:04] lord spake unto moses saying see i have
[35:06] called by name
[35:07] bezalil the son of yuri the son of her
[35:10] the of the tribe of judah and i filled
[35:12] him with the spirit of god and wisdom
[35:13] and in understanding and in knowledge in
[35:16] all manner of workmanship so he called
[35:18] him and then he called his partner over
[35:20] here in verse six and i behold i i have
[35:24] given with him a holy ab the son of a
[35:28] heissa match of the tribe of dan and in
[35:31] the hearts of all that are wise hearted
[35:33] i have put wisdom that they may make all
[35:35] that i have commanded thee
[35:37] now i want you to just watch the
[35:38] description i'm not really interested in
[35:40] and who's making what but the
[35:42] description the tabernacle of the
[35:44] congregation the ark of the testimony
[35:46] and the mercy seat that is there upon
[35:48] and all the furniture of the tabernacle
[35:50] and the table and his furniture and the
[35:53] pure candlestick
[35:56] the only thing that he calls pure in all
[35:58] of this is the pure candlestick
[36:01] he names all the furniture and the pure
[36:02] candlestick with all his furniture and
[36:04] the altar of incense and the altar of
[36:06] burnt offering with his furniture and
[36:07] the laver and his foot and the clothes
[36:09] of the service of the holy garments and
[36:11] he goes on to mention everything even
[36:13] anointing oil that they're to make but
[36:15] when he comes to the candlestick he says
[36:17] and the pure candlestick because the
[36:19] pure candlestick is mixed with nothing
[36:22] else it's just gold
[36:26] oh praise god
[36:28] amen it shows that that candlestick
[36:30] represented christ but in the book of
[36:32] revelation it represents the bride amen
[36:34] and it's showing that these are these
[36:36] are the two expressions or the
[36:39] expression in two forms of god because
[36:42] when god made man he made man after his
[36:44] own image and when he made him amen and
[36:46] placed him in flesh he was a man
[36:48] singular amen man but then within the
[36:51] man was another part of the man that was
[36:54] to come forth as the woman amen and the
[36:56] man and the woman were one one
[36:58] expression and when god said let's make
[37:00] man in our image after our likeness male
[37:03] and female he made them amen then god is
[37:06] going to be expressed in male and in
[37:08] female
[37:10] and this candlestick is going to be a
[37:12] pure candlestick because it's going to
[37:14] be god all the way
[37:18] praise be to god
[37:21] in the restoration of the bride he said
[37:22] otherwise you're going to form what's
[37:24] known to me as a bride
[37:26] i'll go with you and you will be part of
[37:28] me you will be my bride my life will be
[37:31] in your body just like a husband and
[37:32] wife as one person you and i are going
[37:35] to be one and that day you'll know that
[37:36] i am in the father the father and me i
[37:38] and you and you and me what day is that
[37:42] the prophet said that's this day
[37:44] that this is for this day oh i just love
[37:47] that satan gets so angry at that see the
[37:50] oneness of god all that god was afforded
[37:53] to christ all christ was he poured into
[37:55] the church there you are makes them all
[37:58] one
[38:00] so the true church
[38:02] christ and god are all one
[38:06] now look the bride are one tree of life
[38:09] other words like husband and wife is one
[38:10] christ and his bride are one same thing
[38:13] same spirit same work same signs
[38:15] everything else for the works that i do
[38:18] shall you do
[38:19] also
[38:21] in the message investment he said that
[38:22] great tree
[38:24] that great tree of life when he come on
[38:26] earth they chopped it down by a roman
[38:28] spear and hung it on a tree roman tree a
[38:30] cruel cursed tree but in there he
[38:32] redeemed a bride tree the bride tree one
[38:35] just like him
[38:37] he was a pure candlestick
[38:40] he was a pure tree
[38:42] this tree is one just like him
[38:44] that eve tree from the garden of eden
[38:46] the tree that had fallen even the
[38:48] beginning and adam walked out with her
[38:50] now adam comes with the second adam
[38:53] knowing that he had his eyes open to
[38:54] come to receive his eve and now as the
[38:57] prophet said the prophet david said
[38:58] he'll be like a tree that's planted by
[39:00] the rivers of water grant lord that the
[39:03] waters of life will water this bride
[39:05] tree in the last day where all the
[39:08] denominational branches had been pruned
[39:10] by the husband men and now the spirit of
[39:12] god is living anew in the top of the
[39:14] tree which come from the heart of the
[39:16] tree the word granite lord and may they
[39:19] bring forth much fruit
[39:23] so we see this
[39:25] tree
[39:27] this image of a tree
[39:30] praise be to god
[39:31] now i want to get into this next part
[39:33] i'm just all background amen laying a
[39:35] foundation and it's amazing the the
[39:38] testimony that brother ben gave because
[39:39] that testimony ties right into where
[39:41] we're going today so it was just perfect
[39:44] but but if you look at the rest of this
[39:46] quote in the ephesian church age so i'm
[39:48] not going to get in that yet i always
[39:49] have to click back because everybody
[39:50] reads ahead
[39:53] i hate it when somebody takes my
[39:54] punchline you know
[39:57] so
[39:58] so the quote we read where where he says
[40:01] that that uh
[40:03] and out of the ephesians church age when
[40:04] he refers to to exodus 25 and says she's
[40:08] a beaten goal and the flowers are an
[40:10] option and almonds are all the same and
[40:12] he goes on to say she's perfect there's
[40:14] no fault in her amen in her summed up
[40:16] the entirely the wisdom of god and and
[40:19] all those things the very next things he
[40:21] goes into is this paragraph
[40:23] but not only is the candlestick of gold
[40:25] it is of beaten gold
[40:29] this is what i want to spend time on
[40:30] this evening because this is the
[40:32] characteristic of the candlestick amen
[40:35] up till now everybody wanted to be the
[40:37] candlestick
[40:39] everybody wants to be a reflection of
[40:42] the genuine candlestick which is a
[40:44] reflection of the tree of life and now
[40:46] it's reflected over here in revelation
[40:47] chapter one and who wants to pee pure
[40:50] gold who wants to have no fault who
[40:52] wants to be amen the perfect expression
[40:54] in the mind everybody does but in order
[40:57] to be that it's made out of beaten gold
[40:59] not just gold but a precise kind of
[41:02] fashioning that fashioned this and it
[41:04] was beaten golden
[41:06] hand-crafted of beaten gold according to
[41:09] her blueprints which were spirit given
[41:12] outside of her lord and master jesus
[41:14] christ was ever a people so beaten and
[41:17] purged as the bride of jesus christ
[41:20] surely she is filling up the sufferings
[41:22] that christ has left behind
[41:24] her goods are despoiled her life is in
[41:27] jeopardy she is accounted as sheep for
[41:29] the slaughter she is killed all the day
[41:31] long she suffers much but in it all
[41:34] retaliates not
[41:37] oh god help us
[41:40] we want to be christ-like we want to be
[41:42] pure gold then this is the kind of
[41:44] character we need to have we need to be
[41:46] handcrafted of beaten gold amen willing
[41:49] to suffer whatever we have to suffer to
[41:52] bring forth the manifestation of christ
[41:54] in our day
[41:56] you say brother ted i thought you said
[41:58] we were god you are part of god you're
[42:00] an expression of god but jesus christ
[42:02] was the expression of god and the
[42:05] expression of god was beaten amen was
[42:07] molded was rebuked was chastened was
[42:10] made fun of was mock was rejected that
[42:13] was pure gold on display not even
[42:16] through hybrid flesh amen but through
[42:18] created flesh amen he was come perfect
[42:20] he come the correct way amen and it was
[42:23] god's flesh and it was god's blood and
[42:26] it was god reflected in this tree of
[42:28] life amen and he was rejected he was
[42:31] beaten he was he was made fun of he was
[42:34] subject to the elements he was made
[42:36] subject to the authorities amen he was
[42:38] made subject to people's opinions
[42:42] and if god himself in flesh amen would
[42:45] fashion himself and mold himself and
[42:48] display himself that way what makes you
[42:50] and i think that we're going to bypass
[42:52] this amen and just say i'm part of god
[42:54] amen i'm i there's no fault in me amen
[42:57] there is no fault in you if you've been
[43:00] handcrafted the gold that's been molded
[43:02] into his image
[43:06] praise god
[43:11] she is accounted as sheep for the
[43:12] slaughter she is killed all day long she
[43:14] suffers much but in it all retaliates
[43:17] not
[43:18] neither does she cause others to suffer
[43:23] praise god
[43:25] just think about jesus christ and his
[43:27] life
[43:29] and the way he was treated
[43:31] the way he was spoken to
[43:33] the way he was conspired against and how
[43:36] he responded
[43:37] amen
[43:39] never had to lower himself to the lower
[43:42] level
[43:43] amen of those that were under the
[43:45] influence of the devil
[43:47] he always conducted himself on a higher
[43:50] level
[43:51] he never had to come down and
[43:52] participate in the tactics of the wicked
[43:55] in order to overcome the wicked but he
[43:57] could stay like god even being rejected
[44:00] even being cursed even being lied about
[44:03] even being all the things that were
[44:05] happening to him being beaten being
[44:06] abused being tormented all the things
[44:08] that were happening to him he never in
[44:11] order to gain victory had to lower
[44:12] himself to the tactics of the devil he
[44:15] could remain with the character of god
[44:17] at all times and that character carried
[44:20] through is what won the victory
[44:24] we've been
[44:26] so hybridized for so long
[44:29] and our thinking has been so corrupted
[44:32] by hybridization and laodicea so long
[44:35] that we think it's amazing when somebody
[44:37] puts somebody in their place
[44:40] we cheer him on and yeah he told him
[44:44] they put them in their place they really
[44:46] told them where did jesus do that i mean
[44:49] there was times he corrected the
[44:50] pharisees there was times he said it
[44:51] right he set the record right there was
[44:53] times that he exposed the fallacy but he
[44:56] never mistreated people he never he
[44:58] never made fun of them he never called
[45:00] their name he never became arrogant he
[45:02] never became sarcastic
[45:05] he even had a sense of humor he said go
[45:07] tell herod that fox
[45:08] brother said he expressed a sense of
[45:10] humor but he never did somebody personal
[45:13] damage
[45:14] he never talked about him behind their
[45:16] backs
[45:19] he didn't have to become
[45:22] like lucifer in order to defeat lucifer
[45:28] no matter what happened to him he
[45:30] retaliated not
[45:32] and he did not make others suffer
[45:36] in fact when they were coming to
[45:39] arrest him
[45:41] unlawfully to get rid of him in a
[45:44] conspiracy
[45:45] when peter cut off the ear of marcus the
[45:48] high priest servant
[45:50] jesus using the gift that was in him
[45:53] would not use the gift on himself to
[45:55] deliver himself but he would use the
[45:56] gift on an enemy to heal him
[46:00] would not even
[46:02] allow others or cause others to suffer
[46:07] even when peter who was a friend peter
[46:10] who was a disciple caused suffering
[46:12] jesus healed the suffering
[46:16] say god give me this kind of character
[46:21] worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[46:23] bride of christ
[46:25] and as gold is malleable
[46:28] whereas brass will break with the
[46:30] beating this gold of god will bear her
[46:33] suffering for the lord not bowed not
[46:36] broken not destroyed but formed as a
[46:39] thing of beauty and the joy forever by
[46:41] the trials and testings of this life
[46:47] what is forming her as a thing of beauty
[46:50] yes
[46:51] the trials and testings of this life
[46:55] brother ben god just wanted you more
[46:57] beautiful
[46:58] [Laughter]
[47:00] amen when we realized that what brother
[47:03] ben told us that everything's under
[47:05] control god is just trying amen and
[47:08] and maybe it's nothing grand we can say
[47:10] well what was the purpose of all the
[47:12] things going on and we always tried to
[47:13] make it something so big like maybe god
[47:15] was trying to keep him if he would have
[47:17] went on the beach he would have got
[47:18] robbed or or
[47:21] but maybe god just wanted to have more
[47:23] patience
[47:24] maybe god just want him to realize that
[47:26] everything's in control there's nothing
[47:28] worth getting upset about maybe that was
[47:30] the only lesson maybe it wasn't to keep
[47:32] him from an accident or so he didn't get
[47:34] robbed maybe it was just so a son could
[47:36] learn that it's okay
[47:38] it's okay to have a bad day it's okay
[47:40] when all my plans go wrong it has
[47:42] nothing to do with god's love for me it
[47:44] has nothing to do with his acceptance of
[47:45] me all it is is something that god wants
[47:48] me to learn and i'm willing to take it
[47:50] and move on
[47:52] praise be to god
[47:54] we always want it to be something big
[47:56] that because it always makes us look so
[47:58] special
[48:00] god loves me so much he kept me from
[48:02] getting hit hitting the theory he kept
[48:04] me from getting robbed or who knows what
[48:06] maybe suddenly a great white shark
[48:08] showed up in lake michigan and
[48:11] he was going to keep me from no just
[48:12] keep it simple god wanted me to check my
[48:15] attitude and learn that i don't have to
[48:17] get frustrated when things go wrong why
[48:20] can't we just leave it simple why can't
[48:22] we leave it every day god molding us
[48:24] into his image and training us and
[48:26] teaching us to stay like him and the
[48:28] right attitude and keep the right
[48:29] atmosphere under all circumstances
[48:33] we got to quit playing things up because
[48:35] when we play them up they make us look
[48:36] super spiritual
[48:38] make us look like no just just be real
[48:42] just be for real
[48:44] say god just wants me to know he loves
[48:46] me and that he doesn't want me to act
[48:48] like that
[48:50] praise god that's good enough for me
[48:53] amen
[48:57] and the identified masterpiece of god
[49:00] it's told one time the old gold before
[49:02] they had the smelter they used to take
[49:04] the gold and beat it the beater would
[49:06] the indians in the early days when
[49:08] arizona arizona was in its youth they
[49:10] beat the gold until the beaters seen his
[49:12] own reflection in the gold
[49:15] they beat out all the iron pyrite the
[49:17] drost the dirt out of it until the
[49:18] beater could see his own reflection like
[49:20] a mirror beating out
[49:22] now that's what the gospel does so many
[49:25] people don't like to be turned over and
[49:26] beat out well what the church needs
[49:28] tonight is a good old-fashioned holy
[49:30] ghost beating out of the word and of the
[49:33] world and the things of the world that's
[49:35] what pentecost needs tonight that's what
[49:37] our movement needs tonight is a good
[49:39] old-fashioned gold-turning beating until
[49:42] all the world is beat out of us and
[49:45] jesus christ is reflected
[49:48] remember this gold in this candlestick
[49:51] is beaten gold
[49:53] it must be fashioned by beating it
[49:56] cannot be fashioned by foraging it
[49:58] cannot be fashioned by heating it cannot
[50:00] be fashioned amen it must be fashioned
[50:02] by beating
[50:05] so what is god trying to do he's trying
[50:07] to shape us
[50:08] to get us into shape and he uses the
[50:10] beating he's trying to purge us to purge
[50:12] out impurities and to bring us into
[50:14] shape
[50:15] that's what the beating is for
[50:18] you need all the world beat out of us
[50:21] so that we can reflect the life
[50:23] of jesus christ
[50:26] man there's a picture of an old gold
[50:28] beater
[50:29] beating out the gold
[50:31] but
[50:32] brother bam tells us in the message have
[50:34] faith in god he said moses was taught in
[50:37] all the wisdom of the egyptian
[50:39] and he had 40 years of teaching under
[50:41] his mother and he could even teach the
[50:42] masters of egypt but it taken god just
[50:45] 40 years to get that all beat out of him
[50:47] on the backside of the desert
[50:50] so what was happening on the backside of
[50:52] the desert trials and tribulations amen
[50:55] moses was back there and brother branham
[50:57] said god gave him a hot tempered wife
[51:00] that's how much god loved him
[51:03] because god had to do some beating in
[51:07] moses to change moses thinking to get
[51:10] all the ideas he had picked up in egypt
[51:12] had to get that all out of him amen and
[51:14] now he becomes a
[51:16] he marries jethro's daughter he starts
[51:18] tending jethro's sheep amen he's no
[51:20] longer a royalty he's no longer in
[51:22] charge amen he's the one out keeping his
[51:26] father-in-law sheep amen married to his
[51:28] daughter and she we know she has a hot
[51:31] temper because he has a temper and god
[51:33] needs to break him down
[51:36] amen
[51:39] amen
[51:40] i could say a lot right now
[51:45] but thank god for the spouse he's given
[51:47] you
[51:48] even sometimes when iron sharpens iron
[51:51] in all relationships there's always a
[51:54] little iron sharpening iron
[51:56] and it needs to be that way
[51:59] amen because god wants to mold us in his
[52:02] very character amen
[52:04] and if there's never any iron sharpening
[52:06] iron if you never have a different idea
[52:09] than one of you is not allowed to
[52:10] express
[52:12] somebody's been shut down by the other
[52:14] person
[52:15] because there needs to always be a
[52:16] little iron sharpening iron so that both
[52:19] are sharpened and both are perfected
[52:23] i think moses had a lot of iron i mean
[52:25] it was like
[52:30] but god was beating
[52:33] all of those ideas and all of those
[52:35] concepts and all that he picked out he
[52:37] had to beat it all out of him until he
[52:39] got him into a shape where he was
[52:41] malleable and he could use him amen
[52:45] he goes on to say and why i'm against
[52:47] organized religion he says you know in
[52:48] the old days before they had smelters
[52:50] the goldsmith used to beat the gold with
[52:52] a hammer i guess you've heard of it
[52:54] before it went to the smelter they beat
[52:56] it and gold is the heaviest material
[52:58] it's heavier than lead and so i've done
[53:00] a little prospecting and you can take it
[53:02] in the sands and wash in the wash in the
[53:04] desert and rub your hands over the sand
[53:06] and then then blow like that and the
[53:08] dust and everything will fly away the
[53:10] rocks but gold is so heavy it lays there
[53:13] and then when you pick up that gold it's
[53:15] rolled through so much dirt until it's
[53:17] accumulated a lot and through the
[53:19] volcanic ages it has accumulated up it
[53:22] got sludge and everything iron pyrite
[53:24] and other materials mixed with them the
[53:26] beater used to take this lump of gold
[53:29] and beat it and turn it and beat it and
[53:31] turn it until he beat all the dross out
[53:33] of it and you know how he knowed that he
[53:35] had all the dross out he could see his
[53:38] own image reflected in it
[53:40] and that's the way god does the church
[53:42] he beats every creed every denomination
[53:44] every man
[53:46] man-made dogma until he sees his own
[53:48] life reflecting in you if i do not the
[53:51] works of my father believe me not if
[53:54] that see if what is purpose to the
[53:57] church the life that was in christ isn't
[53:59] reflecting in you don't you stand still
[54:02] if you haven't got patience virtue all
[54:04] these things and temperance and things
[54:06] and godliness and brotherly kindness and
[54:08] all these things that's required of you
[54:11] if we see that we're lacking in this
[54:13] thing we shouldn't get frustrated with
[54:15] the beating because the beating is
[54:16] what's bringing us to what we know we
[54:18] need
[54:19] we need to reflect more of his life and
[54:21] brother says gold is the is the heaviest
[54:24] metal it's the heaviest material amen
[54:26] and so in the beating process everything
[54:28] else is knocked out of the gold amen and
[54:31] the gold is not damaged
[54:35] it's amazing how sometimes we go through
[54:37] trials in our life and maybe you get a
[54:39] heavy blow a blow harder than you've
[54:41] ever had in your life and it sends you
[54:43] reeling and you can't imagine how you'll
[54:45] ever recover from this and you must
[54:47] realize that that that smack with the
[54:50] hammer was never intended to destroy you
[54:53] it was intended to separate you from
[54:55] part of the world that doesn't belong in
[54:57] you because the hammer strike cannot
[55:00] destroy the gold all it can do is
[55:02] separate the world
[55:06] and it's amazing people have gone
[55:08] through hard blows and difficult times
[55:10] and sometimes you see people go through
[55:11] things and you think i don't know if i
[55:13] could go through that
[55:15] i don't know if i could ever stay
[55:16] standing if i went through what they
[55:18] went through but you realize that that
[55:20] what they went through was never to
[55:22] destroy them it was only to purify and
[55:25] perfect and fashion and mold them it
[55:27] could not destroy the gold amen and if
[55:30] you're if within you lies the gold of
[55:33] god no trial can destroy you no trial is
[55:37] meant to destroy you
[55:39] there is nothing that can destroy the
[55:41] gold all it can do is drive more of the
[55:44] world out
[55:46] and bring it more into the reflection of
[55:48] jesus christ
[55:50] sometimes we've hit we've been hit with
[55:52] blows we think there's no way lord
[55:54] you're killing me
[55:56] but he's not killing you
[55:58] he's perfecting
[56:02] amen
[56:07] he says in hebrews 5
[56:09] 7 who in the days of his flesh when he
[56:11] had offered up prayers and supplications
[56:14] with strong crying and tears unto him
[56:15] that it was able to save him from death
[56:17] and was heard and that he feared though
[56:20] he were a son yet learned he obedience
[56:22] by the things which he suffered
[56:25] and being made perfect
[56:27] he became the author of eternal
[56:29] salvation and to all them that obey him
[56:31] called of god a high priest after the
[56:33] order of melchizedek
[56:35] if that was god's plan for his son
[56:39] what's his plan for you and i
[56:42] even paul
[56:44] he had to take paul to the back side of
[56:46] the desert and beat out of him all of
[56:48] his education
[56:50] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[56:51] the prophet says why it was a
[56:53] predestinated seed god said i have chose
[56:56] him yeah i am going to show him what
[56:58] great things he'll suffer for my name's
[57:00] sake
[57:01] god had already chose his suffering
[57:03] before he even called paul
[57:06] before he called him he had already
[57:08] ordained his suffering
[57:10] and was going to show him what great
[57:12] things he must suffer for his name
[57:13] saying before he even calls him there's
[57:16] a plan of suffering
[57:19] i mean paul didn't even have the
[57:21] privilege of assuming everything was
[57:22] going to be all fine when he gave his
[57:24] heart to the lord like you and i had
[57:26] god was so good to us that he kept us
[57:28] blind to the suffering part just showed
[57:30] us his word and we came and said praise
[57:32] god everything's going to be fine from
[57:34] here on out i found the truth
[57:36] but paul didn't even have the privilege
[57:38] of living in that kind of darkness and
[57:40] that kind of ignorance god from the
[57:41] beginning told him what things he must
[57:43] suffer for his name sake
[57:46] he said then i'll send him to the
[57:47] gentiles and disgrace him in every way
[57:50] that can be disgraced but yet he'll bear
[57:53] my name
[57:55] god knew he would come through he said
[57:57] he'd be disgraced in every way he'll
[57:59] suffer he was going to go through all
[58:00] this but yet he'll bear my name god knew
[58:03] because god ordained it and god knew
[58:05] there was gold laying in saul amen that
[58:08] had to come to perfection and the only
[58:09] way to come perfection it was to go
[58:11] through these trials but he would come
[58:13] forth as gold
[58:16] he said paul went down then until he got
[58:19] all of his ecclesiastical stuff cut off
[58:21] of him down at the back side of the
[58:22] desert for three years and a half down
[58:24] there in arabia until he learned the
[58:26] word and the word became he
[58:30] or he became the word you could say it
[58:32] either way
[58:33] and so jesus though he was a son he
[58:35] learned obedience by the things which he
[58:37] suffered
[58:38] and being made perfect he was perfected
[58:42] through suffering he was matured he was
[58:44] fully developed he was completely shaped
[58:47] through his suffering
[58:49] colossians 1 23 it says if you continue
[58:52] in the faith grounded and settled and be
[58:54] not moved away from the hope of the
[58:56] gospel which you have heard and which
[58:58] was preached to every creature which is
[58:59] under heaven whereof i paul and made a
[59:02] minister who now rejoice in my
[59:05] sufferings for you and fill up that
[59:07] which is behind of the afflictions of
[59:09] christ in my flesh for his body's sake
[59:12] which is the church
[59:14] paul says i'm finishing his sufferings
[59:18] paul knew what he was doing i'm
[59:20] finishing the sufferings in my body i'm
[59:22] finishing his sufferings hey it wasn't
[59:25] all left to paul but there's still some
[59:26] suffering to finish up and we're filling
[59:28] the sufferings of the
[59:30] lord that's our commission that's our
[59:33] calling
[59:35] it says in second timothy 2
[59:37] it is a faithful saying for we be dead
[59:40] with him if we be dead with him we shall
[59:42] also live with him if we suffer we shall
[59:45] also reign with him if we deny him he
[59:49] also will deny us
[59:52] if we suffer we shall also reign with
[59:55] him
[59:56] do we want to reign with him
[59:58] then we must suffer with him
[1:00:00] it's part of the package
[1:00:03] i found this picture these are some men
[1:00:06] and myanmar and in myanmar these are
[1:00:08] gold beaters and they're beating out
[1:00:10] gold amen and this beating of gold is
[1:00:13] for a specific purpose they're beating
[1:00:15] it they meant to make it into thinner
[1:00:17] sheets to make it malleable so that they
[1:00:19] could in in in myanmar they're wrapping
[1:00:22] it around idols and things like that
[1:00:24] they meant that they're gold plating and
[1:00:26] wrapping
[1:00:27] figures and idols and all of this stuff
[1:00:28] for their gods but the point is the
[1:00:31] beating
[1:00:32] not only purifies the but the beating
[1:00:34] also makes the gold malleable this is
[1:00:38] what brother branham said brass will be
[1:00:40] broken under the beating
[1:00:43] sometimes you see people amen they're so
[1:00:45] strong
[1:00:46] they're so strong amen but under a trial
[1:00:49] they just crack the pieces they just
[1:00:51] fall away and all of a sudden they were
[1:00:53] such strong believers but under the
[1:00:54] pressure they crack and they they run
[1:00:56] away and they're not believers anymore
[1:00:58] amen the gold doesn't break up the gold
[1:01:01] stays put it's heavier and then
[1:01:03] everything else everything else leaves
[1:01:05] the gold stays put
[1:01:07] just like on the threshing floor when
[1:01:09] the wheat is being threshed out
[1:01:11] everything else is blown away by the
[1:01:12] trials and the tribulations but the
[1:01:14] wheat keeps falling to the threshing
[1:01:16] floor and another round of grinding and
[1:01:18] another round of flailing and another
[1:01:20] tossing in the air the wind blows more
[1:01:22] away but the wheat falls back down the
[1:01:25] same it is with the gold under every
[1:01:27] turning and beating everything else
[1:01:29] flies off but the gold stays put
[1:01:33] and it's beat into a malleable form so
[1:01:35] it can be
[1:01:36] shaped
[1:01:38] because god wants to shape us
[1:01:42] into his image
[1:01:44] let's read this in first peter together
[1:01:46] first peter chapter 4.
[1:02:01] first peter chapter 4
[1:02:03] verse 12.
[1:02:09] beloved
[1:02:10] think it not strange concerning the
[1:02:12] fiery trial which is to try you as
[1:02:13] though some strange thing happened to
[1:02:15] you
[1:02:16] but rejoice in so much as you are
[1:02:18] partakers of christ's sufferings that
[1:02:20] when his glory shall be revealed you may
[1:02:23] be glad also with exceeding joy
[1:02:26] if you be reproached for the name of
[1:02:28] christ happy are ye for the spirit of
[1:02:31] glory and of god resteth upon you on
[1:02:33] their part he is evil spoken of but on
[1:02:36] your part he is glorified
[1:02:38] but let none of you suffer as a murderer
[1:02:40] as a thief or as an evil doer as a
[1:02:42] busybody in other men's manners
[1:02:44] yet if any man suffer as a christian let
[1:02:46] him not be ashamed but let them glorify
[1:02:49] god on this behalf for the time has come
[1:02:52] that judgment must begin at the house of
[1:02:54] god and if it first begin at us what
[1:02:56] shall the end be of them that obey not
[1:02:58] the gospel of god
[1:03:00] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:03:03] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[1:03:05] appear wherefore let them that suffer
[1:03:07] according to the will of god commit the
[1:03:09] keeping of their souls to him in
[1:03:11] well-doing as unto a faithful creator
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:18] if you're appointed to suffer then
[1:03:20] suffer like christ
[1:03:22] if you're appointed unto a trial then
[1:03:25] endure the trial like christ amen and
[1:03:28] understand that nothing is intended to
[1:03:31] break you
[1:03:33] but everything is intended to make you
[1:03:37] he
[1:03:38] was perfected he was the tree of life he
[1:03:42] was the candlestick of gold he was
[1:03:45] he himself was of beaten gold
[1:03:48] she will be of beaten gold
[1:03:51] if he was fashioned of beaten gold we
[1:03:53] must be fashioned of beaten gold until
[1:03:55] it becomes a replica of the one in
[1:03:58] heaven
[1:03:59] the one on earth that moses made was a
[1:04:02] replica of the one in heaven and the one
[1:04:04] amen in revelation 9 brother branham
[1:04:06] pointed us to understand the one in
[1:04:08] revelation chapter 1 verse 9 he pointed
[1:04:10] us back to the one in exodus 25 amen
[1:04:13] because the one on earth is always
[1:04:15] reflecting the one in heaven
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:18] he's gone
[1:04:20] first peter 5 10 says but the god of all
[1:04:22] grace who hath called us unto his
[1:04:24] eternal
[1:04:25] to his eternal glory by christ jesus
[1:04:27] after that you have suffered a while
[1:04:30] make you perfect established strengthen
[1:04:33] and settle you
[1:04:35] that's what the trial
[1:04:37] is meant to do
[1:04:41] i want to read this quote
[1:04:43] out of the smyrnan church age
[1:04:46] many of you know it
[1:04:47] it says i'm going to read the whole
[1:04:49] thing i just put a little section up
[1:04:50] here to remind me to read it
[1:04:52] it's a lengthy quote but just stay with
[1:04:54] me
[1:04:55] said he may commit you to suffering as
[1:04:57] he did job
[1:04:58] that is his prerogative
[1:05:02] he is sovereign
[1:05:06] i don't know why is it that every time
[1:05:07] we get into trouble we say god what are
[1:05:10] you doing
[1:05:10] [Applause]
[1:05:12] why is this happening to me god way and
[1:05:15] it we all do it it happens every time
[1:05:17] but i'm looking for the day when i stop
[1:05:19] doing that and start saying god i'm
[1:05:22] paying attention now amen
[1:05:25] god help us to get to a level of
[1:05:26] maturity where we don't panic at every
[1:05:29] crisis where we don't lose our minds
[1:05:31] every time something goes wrong but now
[1:05:33] we understand that god's in control the
[1:05:35] clock's ticking right on time there's
[1:05:37] nothing out of kilter that god has a
[1:05:39] plan and god has reserved some suffering
[1:05:41] for you and i
[1:05:42] and through that suffering he's he's
[1:05:45] he's perfecting our character and he's
[1:05:47] glorifying himself and so now there's
[1:05:49] nothing strange that's happening to us
[1:05:51] don't don't think some strange thing has
[1:05:53] happened when considering the fiery
[1:05:54] trial that's come your way as though
[1:05:56] some strange thing has happened but
[1:05:58] let's settle back down and say god
[1:06:00] you're working a purpose in my life and
[1:06:02] i'm paying attention help me now lori
[1:06:08] that is his prerogative he is sovereign
[1:06:10] but is all
[1:06:12] all
[1:06:13] all
[1:06:15] with a purpose
[1:06:18] if he did not have a purpose then he
[1:06:20] would be the author of frustration
[1:06:22] and not of peace
[1:06:24] his purpose is that after we have
[1:06:26] suffered a while we would be made
[1:06:28] perfect be established strengthened and
[1:06:32] settled
[1:06:33] as job said he put strength in us
[1:06:36] you see he himself suffered he learned
[1:06:39] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:06:41] he was actually made perfect by the
[1:06:43] things that he suffered
[1:06:45] in hebrews chapter 5 verse 8 he says
[1:06:48] though he were a son yet learned the
[1:06:50] obedience by the things which he
[1:06:51] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:06:53] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:06:56] unto all them that obey him
[1:06:58] in plain language the very character of
[1:07:00] jesus christ was perfected by suffering
[1:07:03] i want you to catch what brother branham
[1:07:04] just said
[1:07:07] he said in plain language the very
[1:07:08] character of jesus christ was perfected
[1:07:11] by suffering
[1:07:15] if jesus christ
[1:07:17] virgin born
[1:07:19] the flesh of god
[1:07:21] with his theophany
[1:07:23] and if his character had to be perfected
[1:07:25] by suffering then how in the world will
[1:07:28] we ever come to a perfection of
[1:07:30] character without multitudes of
[1:07:32] suffering
[1:07:33] without manifold sufferings without a a
[1:07:36] whole heap load of chastisements and
[1:07:38] corrections and i mean if if jesus
[1:07:41] christ god in flesh if his character was
[1:07:44] molded by suffering amen then there is
[1:07:46] absolutely no way amen we should rejoice
[1:07:50] in suffering we should be thankful when
[1:07:52] it comes because there's no way to have
[1:07:54] this kind of character without it
[1:07:57] so i want to read that again because
[1:07:58] it's so striking what the prophet says
[1:08:00] in plain language the very character of
[1:08:02] jesus christ was perfected by suffering
[1:08:05] and according to paul he has left his
[1:08:08] church a measuring of suffering that
[1:08:10] they too by their faith in god while
[1:08:12] suffering for him would come to a place
[1:08:15] of perfection
[1:08:16] why did he want this
[1:08:18] james chapter 1 verse 2 to 4 says my
[1:08:21] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[1:08:23] into diverse temptations knowing this
[1:08:25] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:08:27] patience but let patience have a perfect
[1:08:30] work that you may be perfect and entire
[1:08:33] wanting nothing
[1:08:36] it brings you to perfection
[1:08:40] why does he stand by
[1:08:42] this is out of the section in the in the
[1:08:44] in the church age book when he says it
[1:08:46] he says i know thy sufferings in the
[1:08:48] smyrna church age i know thy sufferings
[1:08:50] and he says i know i know thy sufferings
[1:08:53] and he says why does it seem like he
[1:08:54] doesn't do anything about it when he
[1:08:56] says i know he says i know because it's
[1:08:58] needful i know and i'm not changing the
[1:09:01] situation because the situation is
[1:09:03] needful to build your character and
[1:09:05] display my life
[1:09:09] so he says he's not unmindful is what
[1:09:11] the scripture says he's not unmindful is
[1:09:14] what brother branham said
[1:09:17] why does he stand by the reason is
[1:09:19] romans 8 17 and if children then heirs
[1:09:22] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:09:24] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:09:27] that we may also be glorified together
[1:09:30] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:09:32] present time are not worthy to be
[1:09:33] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:09:35] revealed
[1:09:36] in us
[1:09:39] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:09:42] reign with him
[1:09:43] you have to suffer to reign the reason
[1:09:46] for this is that character simply is
[1:09:48] never made without suffering
[1:09:50] character is a victory not a gift
[1:09:54] a man without character can't reign
[1:09:56] because power apart from character is
[1:09:58] satanic
[1:09:59] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:10:02] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:10:04] throne on the same bases that he
[1:10:06] overcame and is set down in his father's
[1:10:09] throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:10:11] with him
[1:10:13] and the little temporary sufferings that
[1:10:15] we go through now is not worthy to be
[1:10:18] compared to the tremendous glory that
[1:10:20] will be revealed in us when he comes
[1:10:23] the next time you see a brother going
[1:10:25] through a terrible terrible trial
[1:10:28] said listen brother this little
[1:10:30] temporary
[1:10:33] and he's going to look at you and be
[1:10:34] like
[1:10:38] but when we put it in the grand scheme
[1:10:40] the scope of our life and the scope of
[1:10:42] god's plan it's such a temporary thing
[1:10:46] it's such a blip on the radar it's such
[1:10:47] a short even if you suffer for 30 years
[1:10:50] what is that compared to eternity what
[1:10:52] if you're suffering on earth is seven
[1:10:54] years what is that compared to eternity
[1:10:58] the brotherhood said in the little
[1:10:59] temporary sufferings we go through now
[1:11:02] is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:11:04] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[1:11:06] in us when he comes
[1:11:08] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[1:11:11] who are willing to enter into his
[1:11:12] kingdom through much tribulation
[1:11:15] the question is are you willing
[1:11:20] he quotes a scripture out of peter he
[1:11:22] said think it not strange concerning the
[1:11:24] fiery trials that are to try you that is
[1:11:26] what peter said it is is it strange that
[1:11:29] god wants to develop a christ-like
[1:11:31] character that comes through suffering
[1:11:33] no sir
[1:11:34] and we all have trials we are we are all
[1:11:37] tried and chastened as sons not one but
[1:11:39] goes through that the church that is not
[1:11:41] suffering and is not being tried hasn't
[1:11:45] got it it isn't of god
[1:11:49] that's why
[1:11:50] the prosperity preaching doctrine is
[1:11:53] absolutely off the word
[1:11:56] the church that is not suffering and
[1:11:58] that is not being tried hasn't got it it
[1:12:01] isn't of god
[1:12:03] so you can say our church is perfect we
[1:12:05] got no problems then you're not the
[1:12:06] church amen you're not even the one that
[1:12:08] he's worried about it's the ones that
[1:12:10] are suffering and have trials and have
[1:12:12] problems that's the ones that he's
[1:12:13] working on
[1:12:15] praise be to god
[1:12:17] i love how i love how the reality is
[1:12:19] always so far away from our thinking
[1:12:23] hebrews 12 6 for whom the lord loveth he
[1:12:26] chasteneth and scourges every son whom
[1:12:28] he receiveth but if you be without
[1:12:30] chastisement whereof all are partakers
[1:12:33] then you are bastards and not sons
[1:12:36] now this special condition in smyrna
[1:12:39] must be applied to every age
[1:12:41] there is no age free from it
[1:12:44] so he's talking about the smyrna church
[1:12:46] age but he's applying it to every church
[1:12:48] agent and applying it to you and i
[1:12:51] there's no way it's free from it there
[1:12:52] is no true believer free from it this is
[1:12:55] of god this is the will of god it is
[1:12:58] needful we need the lord to teach us the
[1:13:00] truth that we are to suffer and to be
[1:13:03] christ-like in doing it
[1:13:08] love
[1:13:09] love which is charity
[1:13:12] is christ
[1:13:14] god is love
[1:13:16] love
[1:13:17] suffereth long
[1:13:19] and is kind
[1:13:21] what is love love is god
[1:13:24] love is charity love is the capstone the
[1:13:26] capstone is christ god the anointed word
[1:13:29] for the age
[1:13:30] god is love and it says love suffers
[1:13:33] long and is kind
[1:13:36] i thought when you got to the top you
[1:13:38] could do whatever you want
[1:13:41] i thought when you were married to
[1:13:42] christ you were such a special position
[1:13:45] nothing would ever harm you
[1:13:47] i thought as the bride of christ you're
[1:13:49] such a special you're in a glass house
[1:13:51] you're on a pedestal and everything is
[1:13:53] taken care of no when christ came look
[1:13:55] how he lived
[1:13:57] and look how much god protected him and
[1:14:00] look how much god kept him from trouble
[1:14:02] and kept him from suffering and kept him
[1:14:04] from ridiculing shame and
[1:14:09] why would he keep us from it when it
[1:14:11] brings such beautiful character
[1:14:14] when it brings out the very nature when
[1:14:17] you crush the rose it gives its
[1:14:19] fragrance
[1:14:21] why would he not crush the rose when he
[1:14:23] wants the fragrance
[1:14:26] god wants the fragrance of his life
[1:14:28] how is he going to get the fragrance of
[1:14:29] his life if he preserves the petals of
[1:14:31] the rose he must crush the rose to get
[1:14:33] the fragrance because the fragrance is
[1:14:35] what he wants
[1:14:38] please me to god
[1:14:42] it's backwards than what we think
[1:14:46] and the latest in church age he says you
[1:14:49] had better come before it's too late
[1:14:51] saith the lord and buy of me gold tried
[1:14:53] in the fire and then you will be truly
[1:14:55] rich
[1:14:56] are you getting it listen to me
[1:14:59] naked physically we came into the world
[1:15:01] but naked spiritually we will not leave
[1:15:04] it
[1:15:05] oh no we are going to take something
[1:15:08] with this what that something is is all
[1:15:11] we can take with us you can't take
[1:15:12] nothing else but this
[1:15:15] nothing less nothing more so we had
[1:15:17] better be real careful now to see that
[1:15:19] we take something that will make us
[1:15:21] right before god so then what will we
[1:15:24] take with us we will take our character
[1:15:27] brother that is what we will take with
[1:15:29] us now what kind of character will you
[1:15:32] take with you will it be like his whose
[1:15:35] character was molded by suffering in the
[1:15:37] fiery furnace of affliction or will it
[1:15:39] be the softness of this character-less
[1:15:41] laodicean people
[1:15:43] it's up to each one of us for in that
[1:15:46] day every man will bear his own burden
[1:15:50] if you want no troubles and you want to
[1:15:52] be rich and increased with goods and
[1:15:54] have need of nothing you will have no
[1:15:56] character
[1:15:58] that's the characterless laodicean
[1:16:00] condition amen she's blind to her need
[1:16:04] blind to her condition she thinks
[1:16:06] everything's fine and everything's
[1:16:07] wonderful and everything's going smooth
[1:16:09] amen but the real bride is is finishing
[1:16:12] up the sufferings of christ amen and
[1:16:14] she's and she's standing against the
[1:16:16] world she's even standing against
[1:16:18] herself
[1:16:20] amen if you're going to stand for this
[1:16:22] word you're going to stand against
[1:16:23] yourself your own flesh your own human
[1:16:26] mind your own reasoning your own
[1:16:27] affection you are going to stand against
[1:16:30] the enemy that's in your own skin
[1:16:34] amen and if you think that's not going
[1:16:35] to set off a trial mental battles and
[1:16:38] all kinds of afflictions amen that for
[1:16:40] warfare that fight in itself will create
[1:16:42] all kinds of affliction within you
[1:16:47] but we're supposed to have character
[1:16:49] character that overcomes through trials
[1:16:54] in the rapture he says wonder
[1:16:56] could it be already passed could the
[1:16:58] bride already be called as is that what
[1:17:00] we're going through today she has to be
[1:17:03] molded and made into the image of christ
[1:17:06] and christ is the word
[1:17:09] that's the only thing see it's there in
[1:17:11] the word see there cannot be one thing
[1:17:13] added
[1:17:14] there can't be a woman with one hand
[1:17:16] like a man in the other hand like a paw
[1:17:18] like a dog it's got to be exactly the
[1:17:19] word of the lord like he is the word the
[1:17:22] bride is part of the bridegroom the
[1:17:24] woman is part of her husband because she
[1:17:26] is taken out of the husband he was part
[1:17:29] of adam from his side and so is the
[1:17:32] bride not taken from the nomination but
[1:17:34] taken from the bosom of the word of god
[1:17:36] for this day
[1:17:38] and the word of god for this day is not
[1:17:40] accepted
[1:17:42] it's rejected
[1:17:44] and the people who carry that word must
[1:17:46] also be rejected
[1:17:48] but praise god of my lord was rejected
[1:17:50] and i'm fine with being rejected
[1:17:53] and my lord suffered and he had to
[1:17:55] suffer amen to build in him character if
[1:17:58] i have to suffer to build a new
[1:17:59] character then i will suffer amen
[1:18:01] because i don't want to go amen from
[1:18:03] this life to the next one empty because
[1:18:05] i always tried to do everything i could
[1:18:07] to avoid suffering
[1:18:10] i just want to surrender and say god
[1:18:12] have your way in my life
[1:18:14] whatever you've ordained let me walk
[1:18:16] through whatever you want to perfect me
[1:18:18] let me not shirk it or or dance around
[1:18:21] them but let me have courage enough to
[1:18:22] face the things that you bring my way
[1:18:27] in romans chapter 8 it says and we know
[1:18:30] that all things work together for good
[1:18:32] to them that love god
[1:18:33] the them who are the called according to
[1:18:36] his purpose
[1:18:38] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:18:40] predestinate to be conformed
[1:18:43] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:18:46] the firstborn among britain many
[1:18:48] brethren
[1:18:49] you were predestinated to be conformed
[1:18:53] into the image of the son
[1:18:55] you weren't just predestined to be bride
[1:18:57] that's part of it but the bride being
[1:18:59] part of the bride means you were
[1:19:00] predestinated to be conformed this word
[1:19:02] conformed means to be to have the same
[1:19:06] form as another
[1:19:08] similar conformed described what it is
[1:19:11] what is the essence in character and
[1:19:14] thus complete or durable not merely a
[1:19:17] form or outline
[1:19:19] so this word to be conformed to be
[1:19:22] fashion-like unto doesn't mean that you
[1:19:25] just made an outline or something
[1:19:27] similar to this but it means it
[1:19:29] describes what is the essence in
[1:19:32] character and thus complete or durable
[1:19:35] not merely a form or outline you're made
[1:19:37] to be conformed into his image not just
[1:19:39] like the outline of his image but the
[1:19:41] very essence of his image you're
[1:19:43] supposed to be on this life
[1:19:45] the very essence and makeup and complete
[1:19:48] and durable just like him you are on
[1:19:51] this earth to be just like him
[1:19:58] that's
[1:20:00] what we've been predestinated unto
[1:20:03] say i've been predestinated being the
[1:20:05] bride absolutely and in order to be the
[1:20:08] right kind of bride you've been
[1:20:09] predestined to be conformed into his
[1:20:11] image in order to be conformed into his
[1:20:13] image whatever way he was formed is the
[1:20:15] way you have to be formed whatever way
[1:20:17] he was perfected is how you have to be
[1:20:19] perfected because he was represented in
[1:20:22] the golden candlesticks that was beaten
[1:20:24] gold amen praise god it was gold it was
[1:20:28] god but it was beaten gold and over here
[1:20:30] to reflect that amen over in the new
[1:20:32] testament we also must be made of gold
[1:20:35] praise god that's god but it's beaten
[1:20:37] gold gold that is beaten and tried and
[1:20:40] shaped and malleable and molded not into
[1:20:43] what you think you should be but mold it
[1:20:46] into what he thinks you should be
[1:20:49] gold is flexible gold doesn't break amen
[1:20:52] gold can be moved into place amen and so
[1:20:55] god we have our own idea about what we
[1:20:57] want in life i want to be this kind of
[1:20:59] tradesman i want to be this kind of
[1:21:01] person i i want to have this kind of
[1:21:03] image amen but god knows how to take the
[1:21:05] hammer and beat you to a flexibility
[1:21:08] where he can mold you right back into
[1:21:10] what he predestinated you to be because
[1:21:12] you've been predestinated be conformed
[1:21:14] into the image of his son not your idea
[1:21:17] not your parents idea not the idea of
[1:21:19] your family not the idea of laodicea not
[1:21:22] the idea of guidance counselors or
[1:21:23] colleges but the idea that god had the
[1:21:26] image he had of you before the
[1:21:27] foundation of the world that gold that
[1:21:30] is inside of you that is god is
[1:21:32] malleable it can be molded and bent and
[1:21:35] flexed right into the position he wants
[1:21:38] and no matter how hard he hits it
[1:21:41] it doesn't break
[1:21:45] i mean
[1:21:46] there's you see christians
[1:21:49] you see christians real genuine
[1:21:52] christians and you read read about the
[1:21:54] heroes of faith and you read about those
[1:21:56] that come through the church ages real
[1:21:58] genuine the genuine believers of each
[1:22:00] age my goodness have you ever met a
[1:22:02] people so beaten so trot upon so
[1:22:05] downcast arrested and burned at stakes
[1:22:08] and ripped open and families separated
[1:22:10] and all kinds of problems but no matter
[1:22:12] how hard they were hit they could never
[1:22:14] kill christianity they could not take
[1:22:17] the life of christ because the gold
[1:22:19] always remains no matter how hard it's
[1:22:21] hit
[1:22:23] and you've been predestined to be
[1:22:25] conformed into the image of christ
[1:22:29] no matter how hard life hits you it
[1:22:32] can't break the god part of you
[1:22:35] it can break off stone and dross and
[1:22:37] debris and other kinds of metal all of
[1:22:40] that can go flying off of your life and
[1:22:42] you think i'm dying you're not dying
[1:22:44] you're coming to perfection amen you're
[1:22:46] not dying you're losing things you don't
[1:22:48] need
[1:22:50] to come right down to what you need and
[1:22:53] only what you need
[1:22:56] nothing can hit you so hard to destroy
[1:22:59] the god part of you
[1:23:01] and the god part of you is not rigid
[1:23:05] but malleable
[1:23:07] so that every time he reveals more of
[1:23:09] his word and plan to you he can mold you
[1:23:11] right into that plan
[1:23:15] we're going along as believers as
[1:23:16] christians we think we've got the
[1:23:17] message figured out we think we have our
[1:23:19] lives figured out we've been in the
[1:23:20] message this long we know what it means
[1:23:22] we know what god wants and all of a
[1:23:24] sudden he'll open something out of the
[1:23:25] word and you go along and you realize he
[1:23:27] doesn't like that attitude in me
[1:23:31] you can never serve god so long that the
[1:23:33] god part becomes rigid
[1:23:37] you can never be so long amen in the
[1:23:40] message that that your revelation
[1:23:42] becomes rigid
[1:23:45] that's not gold
[1:23:47] if all of a sudden amen god amen wants
[1:23:49] to bring he wants to he wants to bring
[1:23:51] another pedal out he wants to bring it
[1:23:53] around to the side amen and you don't
[1:23:56] want to flex around that side amen maybe
[1:23:58] you've allowed other metal to mix in and
[1:24:00] you become an alloy and not pure gold
[1:24:02] anymore and now you become brittle and
[1:24:04] breakable amen as god continues to beat
[1:24:07] and beat and beat amen it shows that
[1:24:09] something got mixed in it's not pure
[1:24:11] gold anymore but the gold is always
[1:24:14] malleable by god and god can always
[1:24:16] bring it into the shape
[1:24:18] of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:24:20] to reflect the life of jesus christ
[1:24:24] it doesn't matter if it's 20 years 30
[1:24:26] years 40 years 50 years i've been
[1:24:28] believing the message i've been serving
[1:24:30] god god can always open up more of his
[1:24:32] word and always take the gold and bring
[1:24:34] it right into the shape
[1:24:36] that he's had before the foundation of
[1:24:38] the world
[1:24:39] there may be things that in our lives
[1:24:41] have been acceptable for 20 or 30 years
[1:24:43] but as god brings more character out and
[1:24:46] more character that and reflecting more
[1:24:48] of his life then all of a sudden you
[1:24:49] realize god's not pleased with that
[1:24:53] and we were blind to it before but now
[1:24:55] we realize god's not pleased with that
[1:24:56] amen the gold is always malleable and
[1:24:59] always be shaped into the image of
[1:25:01] christ
[1:25:03] he can always always shape it to be
[1:25:06] conformed to his word amen
[1:25:09] regardless of what we thought regardless
[1:25:10] of what we were taught regardless of our
[1:25:12] ideas regardless of what mom and dad
[1:25:14] told us
[1:25:16] god can always shape the gold
[1:25:18] into the image that he wants it to be in
[1:25:22] it's always malleable
[1:25:25] in the message identification he says
[1:25:27] we're invited to be molded in his image
[1:25:31] that we might reflect his presence and
[1:25:33] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:25:36] the life that i live so shall you we're
[1:25:38] invited by god to take him as an example
[1:25:41] and let our character be molded like his
[1:25:43] what a thing my
[1:25:45] then
[1:25:46] then when we let his character be in us
[1:25:49] then we have become sons by having the
[1:25:51] mind of christ the mind which is his
[1:25:53] character
[1:25:54] your mind makes your character let the
[1:25:56] mind paul said of christ this mind that
[1:25:59] was in christ be in you let the mind of
[1:26:01] christ be in you it molds the character
[1:26:04] of the son of god
[1:26:07] you know as our life is being shaped
[1:26:10] year by year and month by month
[1:26:13] it's not the outer form that's being
[1:26:14] broken
[1:26:17] i mean we still pretty much look the
[1:26:19] same we have maybe more gray hair and
[1:26:21] maybe gain some weight or lose some
[1:26:23] weight but that's not what he's molding
[1:26:27] it's the inside man
[1:26:30] and he's molding that thinking that mind
[1:26:33] he's molding it to in the shape of
[1:26:35] christ to think like the word amen to
[1:26:37] agree with the word to reflect the word
[1:26:40] on the outside amen let this mind that
[1:26:43] was in christ be in you amen what's he
[1:26:45] breaking he's been breaking wrong
[1:26:48] thinking what's he been beating out he's
[1:26:49] been beating out the dross of wrong
[1:26:51] ideas and wrong concepts what did he
[1:26:53] beat out of moses on the backside of the
[1:26:55] desert what did he beat out of peter or
[1:26:57] paul on the backside of the desert he
[1:26:59] was beating out wrong ideas and wrong
[1:27:02] concepts and wrong human thinking
[1:27:06] and for us what has he been beating out
[1:27:08] he's been beating out the wrong ideas
[1:27:10] amen that are in conflict and contrary
[1:27:13] to his word and to the character of his
[1:27:15] word so that we can catch more than the
[1:27:18] doctrine of his word so that we can get
[1:27:20] the character of his word
[1:27:23] because the word is a person
[1:27:27] and the person has characteristics the
[1:27:29] person has a life god doesn't want us to
[1:27:32] learn the black and white letter of the
[1:27:34] word he wants us to learn the life of
[1:27:36] the word the person of the word and that
[1:27:38] our character would come into the same
[1:27:40] character as the person of the word
[1:27:43] sometimes we can get so proud of
[1:27:44] ourselves when we know what the seven
[1:27:46] thunders are
[1:27:49] i can read the quotes and i can show
[1:27:50] them to you and and with a little bit of
[1:27:52] time if god will will open the word to
[1:27:54] you you can say ah i can see that those
[1:27:56] thunders are this is the revelation
[1:27:58] contained in the seven seals and this
[1:28:00] that and the other amen but god wants
[1:28:02] more than you knowing what the seven
[1:28:04] thunders are he wants the opening of the
[1:28:06] seals to bring christ into your life so
[1:28:08] that it will break all the wrong ideas
[1:28:10] out of your life and mold you into the
[1:28:12] very character of the person that's been
[1:28:14] opened in this day the opening of the
[1:28:16] word is the opening of christ amen now
[1:28:19] his life is known to us his life is on
[1:28:21] display and his life is now available to
[1:28:24] be lived like never before
[1:28:28] it's got to break our thinking
[1:28:32] and bring it in line and fashion with
[1:28:34] the word
[1:28:35] and if our if the mind that was in
[1:28:37] christ is in you
[1:28:39] then you will live the life of jesus
[1:28:41] christ
[1:28:42] and then in trials and in tribulations
[1:28:45] it'll begin to squeeze the fragrance of
[1:28:47] christ out of our lives
[1:28:50] praise be to god
[1:28:52] said god
[1:28:53] take that hammer of your word of the
[1:28:55] gospel and break dross out of my mind
[1:28:58] break all the the rocks and the stubble
[1:29:01] remember when brother branham i read the
[1:29:02] quote earlier when he's talking about
[1:29:04] the gold that he's picked up he said
[1:29:05] it's got rolled around in the earth and
[1:29:07] picked up bits through the volcanic ages
[1:29:09] and stuff my goodness that's how you
[1:29:12] come into this life and you got rolled
[1:29:14] around in this earth
[1:29:16] a lot of things got to be knocked out of
[1:29:19] there
[1:29:20] gotta be thinned out
[1:29:22] so it can be shaped
[1:29:25] say thank you lord for your shaping
[1:29:27] power
[1:29:30] apostle paul says my little children
[1:29:32] of whom i travail in birth again until
[1:29:34] christ be formed
[1:29:36] and you
[1:29:38] he's travailing and laboring
[1:29:41] until christ is formed in you
[1:29:45] until you are reflecting christ
[1:29:48] till christ is formed in your image or
[1:29:51] you're
[1:29:52] conformed into his image
[1:29:56] until this church
[1:29:59] reflects
[1:30:00] the tree of life
[1:30:02] until this church comes on earth to be a
[1:30:06] replica
[1:30:07] of the one that's in heaven
[1:30:12] brother bram says in the message the
[1:30:14] path of life from 1962
[1:30:17] said the most gracious god
[1:30:19] in the name of jesus christ we come to
[1:30:21] thee with humble contrite spirits broken
[1:30:24] up lord knowing that we're ready for the
[1:30:26] molding
[1:30:27] as the prophet went down to the potter's
[1:30:29] house to be molded and father we desire
[1:30:32] this morning in our hearts that you will
[1:30:34] break us so that will be molded into a
[1:30:36] different characters
[1:30:38] characters that will represent jesus
[1:30:40] christ
[1:30:41] take my foolish heart lord take my
[1:30:44] stammering words and break them to
[1:30:45] pieces lord break my own self-will out
[1:30:49] and make a new person in christ
[1:30:51] granted lord
[1:30:52] that's the desire of our hearts
[1:30:55] is that the desire of your heart
[1:30:58] let's stand and pray together
[1:31:00] musicians if you'll come brother ben if
[1:31:02] you'll come
[1:31:04] brother branham is praying
[1:31:06] he's praying in this sermon and this is
[1:31:08] a a prayer he's praying to god
[1:31:11] amen and
[1:31:12] he's praying
[1:31:13] look at the humility look at the desire
[1:31:16] i mean he doesn't pray
[1:31:19] like a pharisee oh god i'm so glad you
[1:31:21] made me the prophet of the age and you
[1:31:22] gave me so much revelation and i know i
[1:31:25] know better than the denominations
[1:31:28] here comes a man
[1:31:30] who is so gifted
[1:31:33] and he says take my foolish heart lord
[1:31:37] take my stammering words and break them
[1:31:39] to pieces lord
[1:31:41] break my own self-will out and make a
[1:31:44] new person in christ granted lord that's
[1:31:47] the desire of our hearts
[1:31:52] you know what
[1:31:55] if we don't
[1:31:57] get beat out
[1:31:59] and come into the image of jesus christ
[1:32:01] in this day
[1:32:03] then everything's failed
[1:32:06] the whole purpose of our life the whole
[1:32:08] purpose of being here
[1:32:09] you may be wildly successful in your
[1:32:11] business you may make a lot of money you
[1:32:13] may build a beautiful home you may you
[1:32:15] may be able to do you may restore a
[1:32:17] wonderful car you may have accolades and
[1:32:20] accomplishments and things that that you
[1:32:21] can be proud of but if we fail to get
[1:32:24] that life everything's failed
[1:32:27] if we fail to reflect the very life of
[1:32:29] jesus christ and everything in life we
[1:32:30] fail amen and if you never build a
[1:32:32] beautiful house and never restore the
[1:32:34] car and never get the promotion and
[1:32:36] never have uh you know so much money in
[1:32:38] the bank account if you never have one
[1:32:40] trophy or one plaque to hang on the wall
[1:32:42] but you amen by the power of god have
[1:32:44] been broken down and molded and
[1:32:46] fashioned to the life of christ that you
[1:32:48] begin to reflect the life of this word
[1:32:50] then you've been successful god's been
[1:32:52] successful and you've met the goal
[1:32:54] you've met the purpose you've
[1:32:55] accomplished what he wants to accomplish
[1:32:57] in your life
[1:33:00] that's what we should be striving for
[1:33:03] and if along the way god gives
[1:33:05] accomplishment in our lives and trophies
[1:33:07] and accolades then their bonuses their
[1:33:08] blessings enjoy them but don't chase
[1:33:11] after that chase after his life being
[1:33:13] reflected in your life even strive for
[1:33:15] him being reflected in you every day and
[1:33:17] let everything else happen the way he
[1:33:19] wants it to happen we've got to stop
[1:33:21] chasing life and chase after the life of
[1:33:23] christ
[1:33:25] and in pursuit of the life of christ
[1:33:28] christ will do whatever he wants with
[1:33:29] our lives
[1:33:31] things will work out some things won't
[1:33:33] work out some things will be successful
[1:33:35] some things won't be successful there
[1:33:37] may be trophies there may be loss of
[1:33:38] trophies whatever happens that's not our
[1:33:40] pursuit our pursuit is for him
[1:33:44] and we want him
[1:33:45] to reflect himself
[1:33:47] in us
[1:33:49] the greatest desire of my heart
[1:33:52] is that nobody will see chad anymore
[1:33:56] but they'll see christ
[1:33:58] living in a vessel
[1:34:01] that can never live this kind of life
[1:34:04] somebody that
[1:34:06] you've seen people like that
[1:34:08] they're different than other people
[1:34:10] they don't live like other people
[1:34:12] they're sweet they're kind
[1:34:14] there's something about them it's
[1:34:17] that's what i want this word to produce
[1:34:19] in me
[1:34:21] i want the life of jesus christ on
[1:34:23] display more than i want anything else
[1:34:27] and there's still things i want
[1:34:29] i still want to catch a double-digit
[1:34:30] pass
[1:34:32] i'd be so happy
[1:34:34] there's things i want to see there's
[1:34:36] places i want to go there's still things
[1:34:37] i want in life but the one thing i want
[1:34:40] more than any if none of that ever
[1:34:42] happens in my life but if i can reflect
[1:34:44] the life of christ i'll leave here happy
[1:34:46] i'll live here happy i'll be thankful
[1:34:48] that the spirit of god was able to do a
[1:34:50] work in this vessel of clay
[1:34:53] make that our goal make that our life's
[1:34:55] achievement made that make that the
[1:34:56] focus of our lives
[1:34:58] may god have his way
[1:35:00] and let's bow our heads and pray lord
[1:35:02] jesus
[1:35:04] god as your prophet prayed lord that his
[1:35:06] desire
[1:35:08] was that you would break this will out
[1:35:10] of us
[1:35:11] that we take our foolish hearts and our
[1:35:13] words and just break them away from us
[1:35:16] and give us your thoughts and your words
[1:35:18] and your actions
[1:35:20] lord just
[1:35:22] take the gold that's within each of us
[1:35:25] and purge it lord
[1:35:27] get all the world out of it
[1:35:30] help us to lay still and let you
[1:35:33] beat all the world
[1:35:35] keep us lord from running to and fro and
[1:35:37] from jumping up and running to another
[1:35:38] place and jumping up and getting in
[1:35:40] another activity but help us to lay
[1:35:42] still while you beat some of that old
[1:35:44] worldly dross out of us
[1:35:47] and just stay in your word and stay in
[1:35:49] your presence and let you do the work
[1:35:52] that only you can do
[1:35:53] [Music]
[1:35:55] god and then i pray that you would take
[1:35:57] us lord and help us to be patient
[1:36:00] as you fashion us and mold us

[1:36:04] in a hurry

[1:36:08] to feel rushed
[1:36:11] help us to wait patiently lord as you
[1:36:13] bring your life
[1:36:15] into this vessel of clay
[1:36:18] mold us and make us into your very image
[1:36:20] almighty god
[1:36:22] have your way in us lord purge us lord
[1:36:25] of wrong thinking and wrong ideas purge
[1:36:27] us of the wrong desires of our own
[1:36:29] selfishness and our own wants lord help
[1:36:32] us to lay that down now at the altar and
[1:36:34] may you come lord by your word and
[1:36:37] mold us into the image of jesus christ
[1:36:40] god may you reflect your life in these
[1:36:42] vessels
[1:36:44] and may this bride standing at the end
[1:36:46] time be a reflection of the seven golden
[1:36:48] candlesticks
[1:36:50] with you in her midst
[1:36:52] speaking out words of eternal life
[1:36:55] god we want to reflect your life
[1:36:58] god you've called for beaten gold
[1:37:01] this candlestick was made of beaten gold
[1:37:04] god we trust you
[1:37:06] to do the fashioning
[1:37:08] help us god help us to surrender help us
[1:37:12] to yield

[1:37:15] lives

[1:37:19] as we move from this place and travel
[1:37:21] home and to work and to things that
[1:37:23] you've called us to do in this life
[1:37:26] may our goal from here on be to allow
[1:37:28] you to do your work in us
[1:37:31] to reflect your life
[1:37:33] to have that character flowing through
[1:37:35] us
[1:37:36] may everything else fall a far second
[1:37:40] to that great desire in our lives
[1:37:42] we love you god and we thank you
[1:37:45] for your word we ask that you would
[1:37:47] bless it to come to life in our lives
[1:37:50] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:37:52] amen
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:38:00] amen for god
[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:07] oh a vessel
[1:38:10] of honor
[1:38:13] for god
[1:38:27] my
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:39] oh
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:44] of honor
[1:38:47] for god
[1:38:52] oh a vessel
[1:38:55] of honor
[1:38:58] for god
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:25] it's amazing how
[1:39:28] we get so excited i myself get excited
[1:39:31] when brother banham says you're the
[1:39:32] spotless sinless virtuous bride there's
[1:39:35] no fault in you you're gold like he's
[1:39:38] gold and whatever he he is she is and
[1:39:41] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:39:43] she is him hallelujah hallelujah and but
[1:39:46] then he goes but he's beaten gold
[1:39:49] and begins to break down what life will
[1:39:52] be like for a genuine seed of god
[1:39:55] the process that the gold has to go
[1:39:57] through to be fashioned like he's
[1:39:59] fashioned and all of a sudden you see
[1:40:01] why people start off shouting and
[1:40:03] rejoicing because their bride and they
[1:40:05] are believing and not even want to be
[1:40:06] part of the message because in order to
[1:40:08] be bride you have to live the way he
[1:40:10] lived
[1:40:11] you have to go through what he went
[1:40:12] through
[1:40:13] but there's a people on this earth that
[1:40:16] says i jesus for the glory that lay
[1:40:19] ahead endured the cross despising the
[1:40:21] shame
[1:40:22] there's got to be a people with enough
[1:40:24] foresight to recognize what it is god's
[1:40:27] trying to do and what the goal is and
[1:40:29] has more
[1:40:31] they have to come to such a realization
[1:40:33] such a faith that's quickened to us that
[1:40:35] we realize this life is nothing and
[1:40:38] compared to what real life is and what
[1:40:40] lays ahead of me is far greater than
[1:40:42] anything here and that reality will
[1:40:45] bring the right perspective and bring
[1:40:47] the right attitude towards our life
[1:40:50] but you see when people hit trials and
[1:40:52] hit troubles sometimes when we lose
[1:40:54] foresight of what lays ahead and the
[1:40:56] goal that god had and our position with
[1:40:59] christ and the millennium and the new
[1:41:00] jerusalem when you lose sight of that
[1:41:03] they become so dissatisfied with life so
[1:41:05] discouraged so hating their life so
[1:41:08] wanting to be somebody else and
[1:41:09] somewhere else
[1:41:11] i say let's catch a fresh vision of what
[1:41:14] god has for us and the purpose in our
[1:41:16] lives and keep that goal before us and
[1:41:18] say god i don't care what happens in
[1:41:20] this life i want to be here amen i want
[1:41:23] to be in this next life that's the one
[1:41:25] that i'm aiming for
[1:41:27] that's my goal
[1:41:29] amen we're gold praise god we're gold
[1:41:31] we're beating gold
[1:41:33] praise god we're beating gold
[1:41:37] thank god
[1:41:39] he's the one with the hammer
[1:41:41] and he knows how to strike it
[1:41:44] god bless you as you're dismissed may
[1:41:45] god be with you let's sing brother
