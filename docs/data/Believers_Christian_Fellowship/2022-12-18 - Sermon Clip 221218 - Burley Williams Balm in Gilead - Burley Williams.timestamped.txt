[0:00] we see what they was doing to Joseph
[0:02] Joseph was in a bad situation semen but
[0:08] God was behind every bit of this
[0:12] even Joseph didn't understand what he
[0:14] was going through at that moment his
[0:17] brother rejected him just the same as
[0:19] the Jews rejected Christ if you notice
[0:22] what kind of spices they had when they
[0:25] came and picked Joseph up
[0:28] look what God did let's read it again
[0:31] it says here verse 25 they sat down to
[0:34] eat bread they lifted their eyes and
[0:37] looked and behold a company of
[0:39] ishmaelites came from where Gilead
[0:43] that's called The Prophet preached the
[0:45] message there's a bomb in Gilead so I
[0:48] went about and looked up Gilead and
[0:50] Gilead is the place where the bomb comes
[0:54] from
[0:54] now look at the mind of God
[0:57] hit him they sitting there eating
[0:59] wondering what they gonna do God had all
[1:03] that pre-planned let them sit down and
[1:06] eat now you got these ishmaelites coming
[1:09] with bomb with spices and they seeing
[1:12] them coming God time every bit of that
[1:15] perfectly so they can pick Joseph up
[1:19] because Joseph remember Joseph him
[1:23] typing Christ and Christ is also the
[1:25] bomb of Gilead God was sending Joseph
[1:28] down there before they brother they
[1:31] didn't realize the thing that was going
[1:33] to save them they were sending it before
[1:35] them before they got there
[1:37] saw that person this is
[1:39] picking the economy of God
[1:44] actually was the true bomb that God used
[1:47] the ishmaelites to get him down there so
[1:50] that his Brethren the Jews later on
[1:53] Joseph will become their bum they needed
[1:56] Joseph
[1:58] so things that you go through in life
[2:00] God you can't see it at the time but God
[2:03] will preparing everything and when you
[2:06] get down to the bottom of the road he'll
[2:08] take you back say this is why I did this
[2:10] and I'll tell you out of all that I went
[2:12] through that's what I look back to now I
[2:15] know why God done away let what happened
[2:17] to me happened literally it brought me
[2:20] closer
[2:22] to God
