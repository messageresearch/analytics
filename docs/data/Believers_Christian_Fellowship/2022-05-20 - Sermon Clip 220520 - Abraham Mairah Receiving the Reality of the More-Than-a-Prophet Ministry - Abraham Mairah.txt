TRANSCRIPT
========================================
jesus said if you are to receive it this is that elijah who was for to come if you want to receive it if you are designed if you are mandators to receive it if you are one of those for whom this package of mystery is given you will receive him as elijah but if you are not among this one you will of course not take him as a prophet and you'll be very right scripturally scientifically and everything you prove him out if you take him verbatim by what he will say what did he say are you elijah no are you not a prophet no who are you i'm just the voice of him that is to come and crying in the wilderness so brother i give you to understand the prophet this man you are calling a prophet himself he denied he said i'm not and brother many times he says i am not maybe the one i am laying the foundation for him to come i'm laying the foundation that is on purpose [Applause] on the purpose blessing on a purpose that's why he said it is broken it's but it's not broken to the public is the seal is broken it's not broken it's it's not so which is switch on purpose and then the others were saying he has said they are not revealed they are not they have quotes and even those who say john the baptist is not a prophet they have a quote it's there in the bible it's written he denied it but jesus says if you receive it [Music] this is him the elijah the alliance who was to come so to you who are ready to receive it receive it and there are those who are not going to receive it they have their scripture this is to whom to those who take me me what i reveal to them and those who take the the letter that is for those of the letter but this is to those who receive revelation now this is me revealing this to you he is him he is that prophet but the letter which is written there says he said i am not so the letter blinds them but now this is revelation so it's up to you which of the two are you going to take if you remain in the office of the prophet the prophet will deny that he is a prophet but if you go beyond more than a prophet and you go to what the prophet introduced so the one the prophet introduced will tell you the mystery of what he did and what he is and then you know how to treasure what he introduced
