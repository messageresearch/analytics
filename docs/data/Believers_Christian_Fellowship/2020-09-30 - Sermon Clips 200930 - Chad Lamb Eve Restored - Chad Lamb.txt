in the identified masterpiece of god in december of 1964 he says when he made his first masterpiece he put him behind the word when he made his second masterpiece he was the word big difference there's a real big difference from being behind the word and being the word because adam and eve were protected behind the word as long as they stayed behind the word the devil couldn't get to them amen so if they would step around from this word amen then they were open game for the devil and that's how they fell by moving out from behind the word amen but what if there's nothing to be behind anymore amen it's not the thing that was protecting them was separate from them but now the thing that's protecting us is who we really are we are the word amen that's why she can't fall she's predestinated not to fall because she's not behind the word she is the word and the devil couldn't go through that word to get to them amen but now we are the word and he can't break the word [Applause] it's different god protected him behind the wall of the word because it was a foreshadow but when the reality comes it's not behind the word it is the word you can no more fail than god can fail amen you are the living word amen jesus christ manifested in the flesh body of his bride amen how is the devil gonna get he can circle all around it amen but he cannot penetrate that word because we are the word the living word restored back to the word the word come to the word the body and the headship the capstone is united together and when we take him his word amen when we take his body the word we become in him the word amen cannot be defeated cannot fail amen why because the word has been restored to the original condition the bride has been united with that word and come in the word to be part of the word and she's not hiding behind anything she doesn't have to hide behind anything there's nothing to hide behind jesus christ when he came in flesh two thousand years ago he wasn't hiding behind anything he was the word made flesh he didn't have to hide he didn't need protection he was the word and he could not be defeated amen we're not hiding worried if i step over here if i step over here i'll be lost and oh i've got to be so careful no you are the word the very plan of god the very heart purpose of god is taking place in our lives right now and it cannot fail it's predestinated not to fall
