TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not they were disbelieving the manifestation of their hour after that after they disbelieved after that he appeared in another form and the two of them as they walked and went in the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believe they them so we have the mouth of two witnesses and they're not believing so what does God do with his predestinated seed who's not believing does he cast them away does he does he chasten them and say you're no longer part of me you get away from me no he can't cast him away no matter what their stupidity or unbelief is because they were part of him before the foundation of the world their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life he can't cast them away brother bam said he would he would get rid of us for our stupidity I've had some stupidity but he can't get rid of me amen he can't cast me away because he chose me for the foundation of the world so here it's two the the first group comes back with the testimony he's alive they believe it not the two on the road to mass come back with the testimony he's alive they believe it not in verse 14. afterward he appeared unto the eleven now he came to them himself I'm telling you it's good to be elect it's good to be elect amen it's good to be part of the program because no matter what you said when you first heard the message or what foolish statement you made or how you didn't believe this crazy thing your neighbor or your friend or your co-worker or somebody else taught you amen but down inside of you was a predestinated seed Gene of God that he wasn't going to lose amen so somewhere along the line if you didn't believe this testimony and didn't believe that testimony somewhere along the line he would come to you after Rudy appeared unto the 11 as they sat at me and unbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of harm because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen he embraded them he rebuked him he corrected them and then what did he do he said go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature you're still mine and I still got a job for you to do you're still part of the program you're still part of the promise you're still my seed you're still the manifestation of the hour that caused me to come to you myself praise God Almighty it's good to be elect friends I mean we've done all the foolishness thing the world has done we've done all the foolish things the denominations have done the difference is predestination the difference is election and that election didn't allow him to throw us away that election wouldn't allow him to to go seek another that election would bring him to us in a personal revelation of Jesus Christ himself revealed personally amen Amen to us
