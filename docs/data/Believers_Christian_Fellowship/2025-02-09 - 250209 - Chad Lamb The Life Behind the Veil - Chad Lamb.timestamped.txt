[19:46] and wisdom and may be able to relax and
[19:49] just share what's on his heart Lord and
[19:50] may it be a blessing there as well we're
[19:53] trusting in you Lord this morning and
[19:55] may you bless us and all that we say and
[19:57] do May be pleasing to you and bring
[20:00] honor and glory to your name in Jesus
[20:02] Christ's name we pray amen amen God
[20:06] bless you man while we're standing let's
[20:09] just take if you would take your Bibles
[20:10] with me and turn to Galatians uh chapter
[20:14] 4 uh you heard the testimony that Brock
[20:18] gave of his cousin Abby getting baptized
[20:20] that was such a blessing on Thursday he
[20:23] called me Thursday morning and and you
[20:27] know Brock said I've got a
[20:29] problem I said well what's the problem
[20:31] and he started telling me the story of
[20:33] talking to his cousin and her desire to
[20:35] be baptized I said brother that's no
[20:37] problem that's that's one of the best
[20:40] problems we've had you know I like those
[20:42] kind of problems so it was just by the
[20:44] grace of God we were able to put it
[20:46] together she came over that afternoon
[20:48] and we baptized her here in the
[20:50] baptistry and there was a few of the
[20:51] folks here brother John and sister
[20:53] Rachel pitsenberger were here and
[20:55] brother Franco and Sister Amy were here
[20:56] and Brock and Kylie were here and amen
[20:59] it was such a blessing to see her take
[21:02] the step that she knew was the next step
[21:03] to take and she still has a lot of
[21:06] questions a lot of things that she
[21:07] doesn't understand she's heard a lot of
[21:09] things for the first time a lot of
[21:11] things that were new but when when God
[21:13] challenged her with the word she was
[21:15] able to Humble whatever she thought and
[21:17] accept that word and I just I I believe
[21:19] God will honor his promise I know he
[21:21] will cuz it's a promise and that she
[21:23] will receive what she desires amen so
[21:26] just remember to keep her in prayer but
[21:27] that was a quite a blessing amen that
[21:29] was exciting so if any of you ever if
[21:32] any of you run into problems like that
[21:34] don't hesitate to call
[21:35] me it's our pleasure and then then he
[21:38] apologized later I'm sorry brother Chad
[21:40] I'm sorry I said how are you apologizing
[21:42] brother you've made my day you know so
[21:45] that was a wonderful blessing so we're
[21:47] thankful for that also just before we
[21:49] read the scripture I just want to remind
[21:51] you that my family and I will be going
[21:53] away for a few days from this Wednesday
[21:55] to Saturday so brother Benjamin seabolt
[21:57] will be uh he scheduled to minister this
[21:59] Wednesday so I just be remembering him
[22:01] in prayer and the service in prayer and
[22:04] also uh we'll get back on Saturday but
[22:06] I've asked brother Gabe to preach this
[22:07] Sunday this following Sunday and so
[22:10] brother Gabe Smith has agreed to take
[22:11] that service so remember him in prayer
[22:13] as well and then just pray for us also
[22:15] we wouldd appreciate that amen let's
[22:18] turn uh to Galatians chapter
[22:23] 4 and look at verse 19 Galatians 4 and
[22:27] 19
[22:31] the Apostle Paul writes my little
[22:33] children of whom I travail in birth
[22:35] again until Christ be formed in you amen
[22:39] God bless you as you have your seats
[22:41] amen it's all these little nugget
[22:42] scriptures that mean so much to us amen
[22:45] and why does it mean so much to us
[22:46] because of the opening of the seals
[22:48] because of the revealing of the mystery
[22:50] of God God opening his mind and
[22:52] revealing to us his great plan and these
[22:55] little nuggets that have been laying in
[22:56] the Bible amen all these years in this
[22:59] end time have been taken out and
[23:01] Polished up for us amen and now they
[23:03] just shine with such light amen I I just
[23:07] want to uh stop for a minute before I go
[23:08] on preaching once I start with the
[23:10] scripture I'm usually Off to the Races
[23:12] but I just want to uh take a minute to
[23:14] appreciate Brother Joseph Scott for
[23:15] cleaning up the parking lot for us amen
[23:18] he was here uh yesterday afternoon and
[23:21] laid down a layer of salt ahead of time
[23:23] then he came back at 6:00 this morning
[23:26] laid down another layer of salt and then
[23:28] about an hour and a half later he
[23:29] touched it up with another layer of Sal
[23:31] so we just appreciate him putting in all
[23:33] his effort for all of us amen so that we
[23:36] could come
[23:41] today also really appreciate our
[23:44] trustees they do all the work behind the
[23:46] scenes that nobody knows and it's good
[23:47] because if you know then usually it's
[23:49] bad I mean it's better if you have no
[23:50] idea but they make sure we have the
[23:52] equipment we need the supplies we need
[23:54] the schedule and everything so that we
[23:57] don't really have to think about about
[23:58] it it just happens you know and we don't
[24:00] even have to say I wonder what will
[24:01] happen with the parking lot we know it's
[24:03] going to be taken care of so we really
[24:05] appreciate the work that they do and we
[24:07] want to acknowledge that especially at
[24:09] times like that and it's always a
[24:11] precarious decision whether to have
[24:14] church or not to have church like today
[24:16] I always ask God
[24:18] why why I want a green light or a red
[24:20] light why is it always
[24:22] yellow and you have to decide do I go
[24:24] through or not go through do I hit the
[24:26] brakes or do I hit the intersection and
[24:28] it's like God you're challenging us all
[24:30] the time I don't I guess he wants us to
[24:33] grow I don't know or depend on him or
[24:35] get out of our own I don't know I really
[24:37] haven't figured out what it is but I
[24:39] know that it's a special trial designed
[24:41] for me because I think about people
[24:43] getting out in traveling and I think
[24:45] about and and I know I know how faithful
[24:49] the body of Christ is to come but I just
[24:52] want to let you know don't ever don't
[24:54] ever come if you're not comfortable
[24:56] coming cuz there's some times that we
[24:58] get on a we get we make a decision and
[25:00] we just we don't know for sure if it's
[25:02] the right decision we just trust God to
[25:04] lead you got a yellow light do you go
[25:06] through or do you stop amen and and and
[25:09] who knows which is the right decision
[25:11] till after you make it but if you ever
[25:13] get in a situation where you just don't
[25:14] feel safe driving or you're in an area
[25:16] that's more impacted by this area or
[25:19] whatever happens don't don't feel bad
[25:22] about staying home just because we're
[25:23] having church amen those who can make it
[25:26] those who are not impacted those can be
[25:27] here will create an atmosphere so we can
[25:29] stream and you can stay home amen and
[25:32] stream so don't ever feel guilty for
[25:33] that don't ever feel bad for missing
[25:35] church I know how faithful you all are
[25:37] and that's actually what gives me such
[25:39] consternation when I make my decision
[25:41] because I know there are some that'll
[25:42] drive in that shouldn't do
[25:44] it I know it but they trust God and say
[25:47] God will take care of me and the way
[25:49] they go and so and I know we've got and
[25:51] the reason I say is we've got more storm
[25:53] Cycles coming and isn't it amazing that
[25:56] the storms always like to hit on
[25:58] Wednesday it's beautiful Saturday night
[26:00] Sunday morning and Wednesday it's great
[26:02] I could be a
[26:05] meteorologist I could say in January and
[26:07] February we're going to have inclement
[26:08] weather on Wednesdays and on Saturdays
[26:10] and Sundays and I my my accuracy would
[26:13] probably be better than the ones who
[26:14] went to school for whatever six
[26:17] years so just a special challenge
[26:20] friends so just remember to pray for us
[26:22] pray for those who have to make the
[26:24] decision I I usually always confer with
[26:27] the deacons and the trust these and try
[26:28] to find out what's going on in all the
[26:30] areas and we do the best that we can but
[26:32] we're just human beings so just remember
[26:35] to pray for us amen pray for us as we
[26:38] make those decisions so we know we got
[26:41] whatever predictions coming up on
[26:42] Wednesday we'll just see what happens
[26:45] and then who knows they say then another
[26:48] weekend
[26:49] storm praise the
[26:51] Lord we're being perfected friends we're
[26:54] being perfected but but nonetheless just
[26:57] just pray and uh I just want to just
[27:00] just uh say that I guess it makes me
[27:02] better feel better to say it you know
[27:04] stay home but I know it won't happen so
[27:06] we'll do what we can to make things as
[27:08] safe as we can amen how many's happy to
[27:11] be here today I'm certainly happy amen
[27:15] I've been tried on every hand I mean EV
[27:18] if I told you you would just laugh
[27:20] everything that could go wrong has gone
[27:22] wrong in every difficult situation has
[27:24] happened amen all the way to my computer
[27:27] locking up just 30 seconds before I come
[27:29] out here and I had to do a hard
[27:31] reboot and I just said Lord praise God
[27:36] you know praise the Lord but it's
[27:39] working now so we'll see what happens so
[27:41] we trust that the Lord has something in
[27:43] store for us because the devil certainly
[27:44] likes to fight and likes to make it hard
[27:47] but he's just a tool in the hand of God
[27:49] for our Perfection and the harder we
[27:50] have to press amen the better the battle
[27:53] amen the greater the victory so we trust
[27:55] that God will have his great Victory
[27:57] today by his word
[27:58] word man when we look at uh the
[28:00] scripture that we read it's so familiar
[28:03] I I think we could preach on it every
[28:06] service not that we will but I think we
[28:09] could because it has so much to do with
[28:11] the revelation of the hour amen it is
[28:14] the word it is the word that was
[28:16] reserved to be unlocked in this hour and
[28:19] we know it has to lay in the Bible and
[28:21] it's been true in every hour we're not
[28:23] saying that it wasn't true in Paul's day
[28:25] it was very much true in Paul's day but
[28:27] the the full impact of that and the full
[28:29] realization of it was going to come to
[28:32] light in this hour that God is he was
[28:34] going to take the veil off of his great
[28:36] mystery is he was going to reveal what's
[28:38] been in the back part of his mind all of
[28:40] this time he would have these things
[28:42] laying down here that Paul would lay in
[28:44] that were true and they've always been
[28:45] true but the impact of their truth and
[28:48] how true they really are amen begin to
[28:50] impact us after the opening of the word
[28:52] amen and in our lives as individuals it
[28:55] Contin to impact us more and more God
[28:58] peels more of that mystery away for us
[29:01] and our own personal revelation amen and
[29:03] I and I know that that will continue I
[29:05] never wanted it to stop in my life I
[29:07] want these scriptures to become more
[29:09] real to me all the time I want them to
[29:11] take on more color I want them to shine
[29:13] brighter and more than that I want them
[29:15] to reflect in
[29:17] me amen and as we go there's many things
[29:20] that I'm going to uh talk about this
[29:21] morning that we've talked about along
[29:22] the way amen but they just start to they
[29:25] start to come in like I said to that
[29:27] clearer Focus that crisper vision of
[29:29] what God is doing in this hour Amen in
[29:32] in in the message the unveiling of God
[29:35] I've got several quotes from the
[29:36] unveiling of God he says now he said now
[29:39] Moses you understand the people
[29:42] understand now I have showed you I have
[29:43] Vindicated you God had veiled himself in
[29:46] his Prophet to speak his word to the
[29:49] people Moses was the Living God to them
[29:52] the Living Word of God made manifest
[29:55] that's the reason his face is veiled
[29:57] he's referring bring back to when Moses
[29:59] would get the word of the Lord and as he
[30:01] would go deliver it his face would shine
[30:03] so bright that the camp of Israel
[30:05] couldn't take it so he would put a veil
[30:07] over his his face and to deliver the
[30:09] word of God Amen and when God was when
[30:13] Moses was in that position having the
[30:16] Living Word of God the word of God for
[30:18] that day and he was the vessel that was
[30:20] going to deliver the word amen remember
[30:23] when God brought them out to the
[30:24] mountain God wanted to deliver the word
[30:26] to him himself amen God wanted to speak
[30:29] to the camp himself and so God you know
[30:32] he set the conditions and he come to the
[30:33] mountain and he told him to prepare
[30:35] themselves and when God began to thunder
[30:37] out amen those Ten Commandments and it
[30:39] was the Thunder of God Amen it
[30:41] frightened him the voice of God
[30:42] frightened him so much instead of
[30:44] running to God they ran away from God
[30:46] and they commissioned Moses Moses you go
[30:48] to God and hear whatever he says and
[30:50] bring it back to us and we'll do
[30:52] whatever he says and and and we know
[30:54] that this was wrong but it was right
[30:57] right it was wrong that they ran from
[30:59] God but it was right right because God
[31:01] was now going to start working through
[31:02] His prophets it fit into his program
[31:05] although it was the wrong action for
[31:06] them to
[31:08] take but now because now they've decided
[31:12] that they want Moses to become amen The
[31:15] Vessel that's to go between now when
[31:17] Moses would go and get that word that
[31:19] God wanted to thunder to them himself
[31:21] now it came into Moses and as Moses was
[31:24] carrying that he became a living God to
[31:28] the people not that not that he was all
[31:30] that God was but he was carrying the
[31:32] very message that God wanted to deliver
[31:34] and he was standing in the place of God
[31:38] and he would come down and he would
[31:40] deliver that message and as he would
[31:41] deliver that message amen it was a
[31:43] message from God and he was the
[31:45] mouthpiece of
[31:47] God okay and so that's why he said Moses
[31:51] was the Living God to them the Living
[31:54] Word of God made manifest that's the
[31:56] reason his faith
[31:58] is veiled see and then this is the next
[32:01] statement this is what really starts to
[32:04] impact you and I he said do you know the
[32:07] same thing in a genuine Christian is
[32:08] veiled today to
[32:10] unbelievers so now he's taking it from
[32:13] Moses and he's starting to bring it down
[32:14] to you and I but he's doing it and he
[32:17] we're going to read the rest of what he
[32:18] says but he does it in ways that's much
[32:20] simpler than we can
[32:22] imagine he said do you know the same
[32:24] thing in a genuine Christian is veiled
[32:27] today to un
[32:28] believers they see them women with long
[32:31] hair and things and look and they say
[32:33] look at that old model women twist their
[32:36] hair up on the back they got a flat tire
[32:38] spare tire up there see it's all veiled
[32:41] they're
[32:42] blind oh they say I got a PhD I don't
[32:45] care what you got you're still ignorant
[32:47] of the
[32:48] word now brother M says now what that
[32:51] was in Moses that he became the Living
[32:53] God he became let me read it again he
[32:56] Moses was the living God to them the
[32:58] Living Word of God made manifest that's
[33:00] the reason his face was veiled and and
[33:04] when we go into the scriptures and we
[33:05] may we may read those later but it
[33:08] begins to talk about how in the Old
[33:10] Testament Moses had to Veil his face
[33:13] because they couldn't stand the glory of
[33:15] the
[33:16] Lord so what was the glory of the Lord
[33:19] they couldn't stand that Moses had went
[33:21] into the presence of the Lord and got
[33:23] the very Living Word the very current
[33:26] present tense message that God wanted to
[33:28] speak to them and now he became the
[33:30] vessel that God was going to use to
[33:31] speak to
[33:33] them and when he had that word and it
[33:36] was going to come out of his mouth and
[33:38] he became the mouthpiece of God that
[33:41] that face glowed so brightly with the
[33:44] glory of God that they couldn't stand to
[33:47] see it because that was going to be the
[33:50] very vessel and method that God was
[33:52] going to bring his Living Word to them
[33:55] and they couldn't handle that Glory
[33:56] because that face was shining with deity
[34:00] yeah with the glory of God because it
[34:03] wasn't Moses Moses was the one who
[34:06] killed an Egyptian Moses was the one who
[34:08] ran away Moses was the one who couldn't
[34:10] do it who argued with God Moses was the
[34:13] one who would eventually make the
[34:14] mistake and and and he would strike the
[34:16] rock twice Mo Moses was Moses and that's
[34:19] why brother B said after Moses delivered
[34:21] his message he was just Moses again and
[34:22] he could remove the
[34:24] veil so it wasn't that Moses I mean it
[34:28] wasn't that Moses himself the flesh body
[34:31] of Moses was deity it was the very it
[34:34] was the very vessel that God was using
[34:36] to bring his own Word of Life to them
[34:39] and that was what made it Glow with the
[34:41] deity of
[34:43] God now he brings that down to you and I
[34:46] and he says that was a natural Veil that
[34:49] Moses had to put onto his face because
[34:51] they couldn't handle the glory but now
[34:53] he says the veil is changed and he says
[34:55] in the New Testament he says now the
[34:57] Veil is on their
[35:01] heart now the veil is on their heart so
[35:05] they can't see what God is
[35:08] doing so even now when he said when they
[35:10] read the law of Moses the veil is on
[35:12] their
[35:15] heart but now he says do you know the
[35:17] same thing in a genuine Christian is
[35:19] veiled today to
[35:22] unbelievers so what same thing then he
[35:25] goes to such a simple example he says
[35:28] they see a woman with long hair and say
[35:30] look at that old model and then they say
[35:32] when it's twisted up on the back of her
[35:34] head look there goes she got a flat tire
[35:36] on her head and they're mocking but what
[35:38] are they mocking they're not mocking The
[35:40] Vessel they're mocking the
[35:43] word it wasn't the vessel listen it's
[35:47] not that Tabernacle of clay that's deity
[35:50] it's not that Tabernacle of clay amen
[35:53] that's the glory of God but it's when
[35:55] that Tabernacle of clay come subjection
[35:58] to the word and starts to manifest the
[36:00] word and long hair amen when they reject
[36:03] that they've rejected God Amen they're
[36:06] blind to the fact that it's not the
[36:08] vessel listen this is what's so hard
[36:11] sometimes for us to separate this is why
[36:13] people fall on one side or the other
[36:15] they either overestimate themselves or
[36:17] underestimate themselves they have
[36:19] trouble with what brother benham's
[36:20] saying or what other people say about
[36:22] the bride because they're looking at the
[36:23] flesh or or they go too far and they
[36:25] make the flesh deity yeah right so we
[36:28] can fall on either side of this problem
[36:30] but it's not it's not that flesh body
[36:34] amen this flesh body is born in
[36:36] corruption it's still in a Corrupted
[36:37] State it's still a cauber nature it's
[36:39] got to be changed one day in the atams
[36:41] it's got to be completely restructured
[36:44] yeah so it's not that but when this body
[36:47] amen puts on the word of God and begins
[36:50] to manifest the word when the word says
[36:53] a amen uh it's a shame for a woman to
[36:55] have short hair and then she puts that
[36:57] on and she realizes that she's not to
[37:00] cut her hair it's a it's a sign of Glory
[37:02] it's a sign of headship amen and she
[37:04] wears that amen that actually is the
[37:07] Living Word it becomes the display of
[37:10] God
[37:12] Amen and the veil now is not on our
[37:16] faces and it's not on our hair and
[37:18] that's not where the veil is the veil is
[37:20] on the heart of the people that can't
[37:21] see that's the Living Word yeah it looks
[37:24] like an oldfashioned and this and it
[37:26] looks like a this but they don't
[37:28] understand that that's actually the word
[37:30] of God made manifest living right before
[37:33] their
[37:34] eyes but the veil is on the heart that
[37:37] can't see
[37:39] it but he says in the scripture but when
[37:41] it is turned to the Lord the veil is
[37:44] taken
[37:45] away then all of a sudden they
[37:48] understand that's
[37:51] God not the human being the human being
[37:54] subject to the word living the word
[37:56] that's God
[37:58] because what is God the
[38:00] word amen the Word was God the word was
[38:04] made flesh and dwelt Among Us what is
[38:07] this it's the word made
[38:10] flesh in My Flesh and in your
[38:13] flesh and that becomes a Living Word of
[38:16] God to the people so it's it's veiled
[38:22] it's veiled because it's in human flesh
[38:25] like any other kind of human flesh amen
[38:28] we can't make our flesh Superior to
[38:30] anybody else's
[38:32] flesh we can't we we can't all of a
[38:34] sudden make this guy and the attributes
[38:38] of the guy somehow better amen to
[38:40] anybody else my My Flesh and my human
[38:44] Spirits no better than than than the the
[38:47] the drug addict on the
[38:49] street we're both born the same way we
[38:51] both come into the life with the same
[38:53] corruption we're both dealing with the
[38:55] same outside man yeah so I can't make
[38:58] this any better than that what's the
[39:00] difference it says when God by his own
[39:02] Spirit takes control and makes the word
[39:05] live in this flesh amen that becomes the
[39:08] Living Word of God that becomes a
[39:10] manifestation of God to the
[39:13] people so sometimes it's so hard for us
[39:15] to separate these things because
[39:17] sometimes we get so contrary thinking
[39:19] because of our flesh don't worry about
[39:21] the flesh amen just focus on Christ his
[39:24] life will bring the sess into subjection
[39:26] and it'll live the life but you then you
[39:28] can say but what about if I make a
[39:30] mistake amen you'll make a mistake it
[39:32] doesn't matter that I mean I can't say
[39:34] it doesn't matter mistakes matter but
[39:36] God has already paid an atoning price to
[39:38] pay for that mistake he's not expecting
[39:40] the flesh to be perfect what he's
[39:42] looking for is a surrendered vessel that
[39:43] he can take control of and begin to
[39:45] manifest himself Moses wasn't perfect
[39:48] but God still manifest himself through
[39:50] Moses after his mistakes before his
[39:53] mistakes in between his mistakes he
[39:56] manifest himself through Moses
[39:59] amen so what we're looking for is the
[40:01] life of God to take control and bring
[40:03] the outer man subject to the life of the
[40:06] word so it becomes a living display of
[40:11] Christ again in unveiling of God he says
[40:13] Moses was The Veil The Living Word of
[40:17] God veiled behind human flesh the pillar
[40:20] of fire was in Moses of course speaking
[40:23] what was to be veiled later behind skins
[40:26] you see
[40:28] amen now that word the word was brought
[40:31] forth then it was written out then it
[40:33] was put behind and still veiled for God
[40:36] was always in that word amen he is the
[40:39] word always he is that word that's the
[40:42] reason that word had to be
[40:44] veiled so it's amazing that the God's
[40:48] word had to be
[40:50] veiled so it was veiled in Moses until
[40:53] Moses delivered it and then when it was
[40:55] delivered it was written down in a book
[40:56] then it was placed in the Tabernacle and
[40:58] the holy of holies behind
[41:00] veils and the Word was always
[41:05] veiled um oh man there's so many things
[41:08] on my heart friends if we would
[41:10] recognize this it would help us so much
[41:12] because the word has always been veiled
[41:15] amen even in the temple in the day that
[41:20] Jesus was hanging on the cross amen that
[41:23] the the word had been veiled back in
[41:25] behind that veil of the Temple but God
[41:29] now took all of that word you know the
[41:32] the the book of ordinances that Moses
[41:34] had wrote it was placed uh it was placed
[41:37] in a little pocket beside the ark it was
[41:39] placed there and then the Ten
[41:40] Commandments that were written out by
[41:42] the Finger of God on those two stones
[41:44] they were placed in the Ark of the
[41:45] Covenant so God's word was back in the
[41:47] ark it was back amen behind the holy of
[41:50] holies amen but when you say God's word
[41:53] was back there really what it was was a
[41:56] representation of his word because his
[41:58] word is living his word is his thought
[42:00] expressed but then it was placed down on
[42:02] two tables of stone and it was placed in
[42:05] the ark and it was written down in a
[42:06] book of ordinances it was placed in a
[42:08] pocket on the side of the Ark so the
[42:10] representation of the word was
[42:14] there you I hope you understand what I'm
[42:16] saying amen we say that this is the word
[42:19] of God and it is the word of God but
[42:22] really what it is is a representation of
[42:24] the word of God because I can put this
[42:26] book in a fire and a house fire and it
[42:28] can burn to bits but the nothing
[42:30] destroyed the
[42:32] word so we say this is the word of God
[42:34] but truly it's a representation of the
[42:37] word of
[42:39] God so what was back behind the ark what
[42:43] was behind the veil was was the word and
[42:46] for years that they had that
[42:47] representation of the word and that was
[42:49] the word and that's where the life of
[42:51] God would come upon the word yeah so
[42:53] when they built the Tabernacle and they
[42:55] placed the word back there the ark was
[42:56] there in the word was there and
[42:58] everything was there then the shakina
[42:59] glory of God would come down and dwell
[43:01] over that Ark and where was he he was
[43:03] wherever the word was his life was with
[43:06] the word amen but then God would take
[43:08] all that word that was written down in
[43:11] the law and in the prophets and
[43:12] everything he would take the fullness of
[43:14] the word and he would put it now in
[43:16] another representation not a not a book
[43:19] written by Moses not two tables of
[43:20] stones but now it was in flesh in Jesus
[43:23] Christ and he was the word made flesh he
[43:27] was the representation of the word of
[43:29] God he was the full expression of that
[43:31] word Made Alive he was God to them he
[43:34] was the he was the Living Word of God
[43:36] manifest yeah amen and it was behind it
[43:39] was God behind a veil what Veil the veil
[43:42] of the flesh body that he designed to be
[43:44] his exact replication in flesh yeah
[43:48] amen so when that they took that word
[43:52] and they nailed it to a cross God Amen
[43:55] would rip the Veil and the temple and
[43:58] tear it all the way down to open the
[44:00] holy of holies Amen to show that there's
[44:03] no life of God anymore in there amen
[44:05] it's not behind the veil but now it's
[44:07] the it's now hanging on the cross now
[44:10] that word and that life is behind that
[44:13] Veil
[44:16] amen and so even though God will
[44:21] open will open the
[44:24] veil even though God would bring a
[44:26] revelation in that
[44:28] day the only way that you could see
[44:32] what's behind the veil is if God takes
[44:35] the veil off your
[44:38] heart same thing's true in this day God
[44:42] has opened the
[44:43] seals he's he's pulled the veil back to
[44:46] show us where he's dwelling and showing
[44:48] where his word is and where shakina glor
[44:51] is and he's done that in this day amen
[44:53] to fully reveal it but the only way that
[44:55] we can see it doesn't matter how how
[44:57] open he opened it he opened it amen did
[44:59] God open the seals did the lamb take the
[45:02] book and open the seals is all Seven
[45:04] Seals open amen they had to be open
[45:06] because it had to come in the days of
[45:08] the seventh angel which was William
[45:09] brand all Seven Seals is the mystery of
[45:11] God finished amen is the is the veil is
[45:14] the mystery that was in the back part of
[45:15] God's mind is it open it is open but you
[45:18] can only see it if the veil's been taken
[45:21] off of your heart because it's open but
[45:23] it's veiled right it's open but it's
[45:26] veiled so now the only thing that can
[45:29] actually tear the veil is a direct
[45:31] Revelation from God
[45:33] himself that's the only thing that can
[45:35] remove the
[45:37] veil so we understand that we'll never
[45:41] tear that Veil Away by
[45:45] instruction no matter how clearly we
[45:47] tried to preach the message and we
[45:49] should preach it as clear as we
[45:51] can I don't think I I personally don't
[45:54] believe in trying to keep it obscure
[45:57] just to keep people guessing I listen
[46:00] trying to explain Supernatural things is
[46:02] obscure
[46:04] enough trying to use the the fallacy of
[46:07] human language which wasn't designed to
[46:09] explain Supernatural the supernatural
[46:11] word our language was only designed to
[46:14] to to reflect the world that we live in
[46:16] yeah right so that's why brother B when
[46:18] he went to the sixth Dimension he says
[46:20] there's not a word in the human language
[46:22] that could describe it why because
[46:24] there's been no word yeah to describe
[46:28] all our words describe things we
[46:29] experience here so he went to another
[46:32] experience and he had no more
[46:35] words so listen re no matter how much we
[46:39] clearly see when God takes the veil out
[46:41] of our hearts and he gives us a
[46:42] revelation amen you got it it's real to
[46:44] you and it's alive the moment you turn
[46:46] to try to explain it you realize it's
[46:48] still veiled yeah
[46:50] amen it's still veiled it's only
[46:53] unveiled by
[46:54] Revelation and that only comes from the
[46:57] father
[46:58] am and and so
[47:03] now the word is always
[47:08] veiled to us it's
[47:11] unveiled because he's taken the veil off
[47:13] of our hearts
[47:15] amen but until the veil comes off the
[47:17] heart it's still veiled amen and where
[47:20] is it's veiled it's veiled in the
[47:22] Christian it's veiled in his
[47:25] bride the mystery is is alive in her the
[47:28] word is in her and the shakina glory of
[47:31] God is in her and it's still veiled to
[47:33] the public
[47:35] amen but it's unveiled to everyone who's
[47:40] had the veil taken off of their heart
[47:44] yeah amen and I want to make a
[47:47] clarifying statement here because when I
[47:50] say things like that sometimes people
[47:52] get a little bit troubled in their mind
[47:54] because they're saying well I can't
[47:56] explain what I believe and and when I go
[47:58] to explain it I get confused and and I
[48:00] try to say what brother bam said or what
[48:02] I heard preached on Sunday and I can't
[48:03] listen that that's nothing that's a
[48:05] human mind trying to take a revelation
[48:07] and put it into a way that's explainable
[48:10] listen that doesn't mean you don't have
[48:12] the
[48:13] Revelation that doesn't mean it's not
[48:14] real to you amen what is it that's
[48:16] jumping up inside down in you when you
[48:18] hear the message when you read the
[48:20] breach when you read the seven seal and
[48:22] something in you is just bubbling over
[48:23] when you hear the preaching of the word
[48:25] and something in you is just saying amen
[48:26] amen amen amen and then you go around
[48:28] and try to explain it and it sounds like
[48:30] you never read the breach and you didn't
[48:31] hear what was preached on
[48:33] Sunday listen don't let the devil
[48:36] deceive you not being able to accurately
[48:38] describe it doesn't mean you don't have
[48:39] the veil removed from your heart amen
[48:42] amen it's a revelation to you personally
[48:45] amen it's not even something that you
[48:47] have to explain to anybody else it's not
[48:49] something that has to make sense to
[48:50] another person in the world Amen it
[48:52] doesn't even have to make sense to your
[48:54] intellectual mind the only thing it has
[48:55] to do is Quicken the life that's down on
[48:57] the inside of you you don't have to even
[49:00] comprehend in your brain what happened
[49:01] to you you have to know something
[49:03] happened on the inside of
[49:06] you amen he says again in unveiling of
[49:08] God he said oh brother sister are you
[49:10] catching it look don't you see it's been
[49:13] veiled through these ages according to
[49:15] what God Said and it'll be opened in the
[49:17] last days those Seven Seals would be
[49:19] broke and the full thing would come into
[49:21] the view of the people that's took place
[49:23] all along the hour of the seventh
[49:25] Angel's message all the mystery of God
[49:27] should be made known in that Elijah this
[49:29] last hour how that Christ is put out of
[49:31] the church the Son of God how he's
[49:33] revealed as son of man again how that
[49:37] the church is to be put in order in
[49:39] everything for the last day no Creed no
[49:41] denomination just absolutely the word
[49:44] living in the
[49:48] individual I'm going to read that
[49:52] again brother B's telling us that he's
[49:56] open
[49:57] it he says according to what God said
[50:01] it'll be opened in the last days amen
[50:04] those Seven Seals would be broke and the
[50:06] full thing would come into view of the
[50:07] people what took place all
[50:10] along amen so that's what God did at
[50:13] Calvary yeah he tore open the seal of
[50:17] the veil to show that he had transferred
[50:21] that word and that life to another
[50:24] vessel and it was in plain
[50:28] view on galtha on Calvary the mystery
[50:33] was
[50:35] unveiled but how many saw
[50:38] it they all saw it but how many saw
[50:44] it it was veiled behind a bloody
[50:47] mutilated
[50:49] victim disfigured and hanging on a cross
[50:52] and counted as a criminal and rejected
[50:54] of everybody and stripped naked
[50:57] and what was it it was the word made
[51:01] manifest it was God unveiled it was the
[51:05] mystery that was in his mind on display
[51:08] for all to
[51:10] see so where was the veil
[51:13] now it was in their
[51:15] heart it was unveiled and now in this
[51:18] day God's unveiled
[51:20] it has he has he opened it is it
[51:24] completely unveiled is it on display
[51:28] how many see
[51:33] it but I I want you to just stay with me
[51:38] on this
[51:40] quote he said it would come into view of
[51:43] the people which took place all
[51:45] along the hour of the seventh Angel's
[51:47] message all the mysteries of God should
[51:49] be made known in that Elijah this last
[51:51] hour how that Christ is put out of his
[51:54] church that's the leodan church age he
[51:55] was on the outside of his church
[51:57] knocking so Christ the holy spirit amen
[52:00] when the word was rejected the life was
[52:02] rejected and he was rejected so he's put
[52:05] out of side of his church but he's
[52:06] revealed as son of man again through a
[52:09] prophetic Ministry through brother Bram
[52:11] how that the church is to be put in
[52:13] order and everything for the last day no
[52:15] Creed no denomination just absolutely
[52:19] the word living in the
[52:22] individual so now what is it now what is
[52:26] this open word what is this unveiling
[52:28] what's it supposed to accomplish the
[52:30] word living in the individual I'll take
[52:34] one and leave one I'll take this and
[52:37] leave that one see there's no strings no
[52:39] denominations no bindings or nothing
[52:41] it's the heart with God and him
[52:46] alone in the breach brother B says watch
[52:49] look at this my broke the seals revealed
[52:53] the Mysteries revealed them where
[52:57] to the last Church age the only one
[52:58] that's living the rest of them sleeping
[53:01] then further in the breach he makes this
[53:03] statement he see he says the seals was
[53:06] broke why in the last Church age to
[53:09] reveal these truths why the lamb broke
[53:11] the seals and revealed them to his
[53:13] church in order to collect his subjects
[53:16] for his kingdom the bride say Oh my he
[53:19] wants to bring his subjects to him now
[53:23] so now now he says at the end time what
[53:25] did he do in the seventh age in the last
[53:28] age amen he broke wide open he tore the
[53:31] veil off he he opened the mystery of his
[53:33] mind amen he put it on display for the
[53:36] people to
[53:38] see amen but remember it's to the
[53:40] individual and what did he do we put it
[53:42] on he opened it up he preached it he
[53:45] displayed it he sent displays of the son
[53:47] of man Ministry all over the
[53:50] world and then he opened the word amen
[53:53] and and he preached it openly and what
[53:55] was he trying to do he wasn't trying to
[53:57] convince the
[53:59] world that the seals were
[54:02] open he wasn't trying to prove anything
[54:05] to anybody he wasn't trying to convince
[54:08] everybody he did that to collect his
[54:11] bride amen he did that he he didn't
[54:15] listen it was it was done in front of
[54:18] the world but it wasn't done for the
[54:21] world it was done openly before the
[54:24] world but it was only done because it
[54:28] was time now to collect his
[54:30] bride first he would collect the living
[54:33] bride who was the seals revealed to the
[54:34] living bride we know there was sleeping
[54:36] bride that had went to sleep in all the
[54:38] previous ages but he come to reveal it
[54:41] to who the living bride they were the
[54:43] only ones present at the time it was
[54:45] revealed in the last age and he did it
[54:48] for what reason to collect his subjects
[54:50] for his kingdom his bride he wants to
[54:52] bring his subjects to him now amen so
[54:55] what was the purpose purp of revealing
[54:57] the seals it was so that God could
[54:59] collect me amen that he could collect me
[55:01] out of denomination and out of confusion
[55:03] and wherever I was he was collecting me
[55:06] to himself and how did he collect me he
[55:08] tore the veil off he opened the mystery
[55:11] amen and not everyone could see it amen
[55:14] but those who could see it were being
[55:15] collected out of wherever they were and
[55:18] they would be gathered to the kingdom
[55:19] and gathered to
[55:24] him amen amen amen amen amen and that's
[55:28] why brother bam says this is not to a
[55:32] group this is to an
[55:36] individual and it doesn't matter how
[55:38] much we want it to be to a
[55:40] group we can't make it to a group I mean
[55:43] it is to a group that group is the elect
[55:46] bride but who they are none of us know
[55:48] you can never go to any group and say
[55:50] now you all are no it's to the
[55:53] individual the individual who's turned
[55:56] to Christ and had the veil
[55:58] removed I want to I want to look at Acts
[56:01] chapter 9 turn there with
[56:04] me if you'll just pray for me I'm a
[56:06] little conflicted about where to turn
[56:07] and when to turn and where to go and
[56:09] what to
[56:10] include but just we trust God it'll lead
[56:14] us step by step as we move forward
[56:18] amen Acts chapter 9 verse one
[56:30] and Saul yet breathing out threatenings
[56:32] and Slaughter against the Disciples of
[56:34] the Lord went unto the high desert a
[56:37] high priest sorry and desired of him
[56:39] letters to Damascus to the synagogues
[56:41] that if he found any of this way whether
[56:43] they were men or women he might bring
[56:45] them bound into Jerusalem and as he
[56:47] journeyed he came near Damascus and
[56:48] suddenly there shined around about him a
[56:50] light from heaven and he fell to the
[56:52] Earth and he heard a voice saying unto
[56:54] him Saul Saul why persecuted thou me and
[56:57] he said who artart thou Lord and the
[56:59] Lord said I am Jesus whom thou
[57:00] persecutest it is hard for thee to kick
[57:03] against the bricks and he trembling and
[57:05] astonished said Lord what will thou have
[57:07] me to do and the Lord said unto him
[57:09] arise and go into the City and it shall
[57:11] be told thee what thou must do and the
[57:13] men which journeyed with him stood
[57:14] speechless hearing a voice but seeing no
[57:18] man here we have the conversion of
[57:21] Saul God is calling Saul now we we know
[57:25] all about Saul he's not been the he's
[57:27] not been the nicest guy he not been the
[57:30] easiest for the church to deal with but
[57:33] Saul is about to get a revelation God's
[57:35] about to open a mystery to him amen God
[57:39] Jesus Christ is just about to unveil
[57:42] himself to Paul
[57:44] yeah and when he does he he smites Paul
[57:47] down and he speaks to him through a
[57:50] pillar of fire and what he sees is a
[57:52] pillar of fire and and God says to him
[57:56] Jesus says to them Paul why persecutest
[57:59] thou
[57:59] me he said who art you L who art thou he
[58:03] said I'm Jesus who you
[58:05] persecute but Saul wasn't persecuting
[58:07] Jesus of
[58:09] Nazareth he was persecuting the
[58:13] church so here God comes down in a
[58:17] pillar of fire and he comes down with a
[58:19] voice of a man that speaks directly to
[58:22] Paul and he calls him by name he says
[58:24] Saul Saul why persecute down me what's
[58:27] he doing he's taking the veil
[58:30] away he's revealing the mystery of who
[58:33] he is and where he
[58:35] is and and Paul is saying who are you
[58:38] I'm Jesus whom you persecute amen and
[58:41] and he goes so far he says Lord what do
[58:43] you want me to do he says you just go to
[58:45] a city to be told you what to do because
[58:47] what's Jesus going to do Jesus is going
[58:49] to come to him in another form that's
[58:52] right because Paul Saul just realized
[58:55] that he was persecuting Jesus in a form
[58:59] what form was Jesus in he was in his
[59:01] body what was his body this is why the
[59:03] Apostle Paul can preach on the
[59:05] Tabernacle the temple the body of Jesus
[59:07] Christ and many members in a body he got
[59:09] a direct Revelation from God himself of
[59:11] what the body of Jesus Christ is that's
[59:14] right praise God it wasn't confusing to
[59:16] him and he could lay it out in the
[59:17] Epistles he knew where the body he saw
[59:20] the pillar of fire but where was that
[59:22] life that life was dwelling in the
[59:24] Christians in that age and when he was
[59:26] persecuting the Christians he was
[59:27] persecuting Jesus Christ and God was
[59:30] going to further enhance that Revelation
[59:32] to him by not telling him in this this
[59:35] this voice from a pillar of fire telling
[59:38] him what to do he said you go to the
[59:40] city and it'll be told you what to do
[59:42] and then God then Christ comes over and
[59:44] he begins to speak to ananas ananas I
[59:46] need you to go because you're my hands
[59:49] yeah amen you're my hands you're my
[59:52] agent on the earth you're my
[59:53] representation I need you to go to saw
[59:56] oh God you know what kind of person he
[59:59] is and this so what does Jesus have to
[1:00:01] do he has to open a seal to ananas
[1:00:03] listen ananas you misunderstand that
[1:00:06] vessel amen that's a chosen vessel unto
[1:00:08] me to bring my word amen to the
[1:00:13] Gentiles so Saul misunderstood ananas
[1:00:18] and all the Brethren but ananas
[1:00:20] misunderstood
[1:00:23] Saul so God had to break the veil and
[1:00:26] then God would come amen Jesus Christ
[1:00:29] would come through
[1:00:32] ananas to give Paul the rest of the
[1:00:36] commission and to lay hands on him so
[1:00:39] that he could see and then baptized him
[1:00:42] and then he was
[1:00:44] healed but we know that there was other
[1:00:47] people with
[1:00:49] Saul there was men that were traveling
[1:00:52] with Saul right and it says at the end
[1:00:55] of the verse
[1:00:58] uh that we just read verse 7 said and
[1:01:00] the men which journeyed with him stood
[1:01:02] speechless hearing a voice but seeing no
[1:01:05] man amen they heard
[1:01:08] something but they didn't see any
[1:01:13] person if we go over to acts 22 let's
[1:01:15] just jump over there
[1:01:19] quickly Acts 22:9
[1:01:28] verse n and they that were with me saw
[1:01:31] indeed the light and were afraid but
[1:01:33] they heard not the voice of him that
[1:01:35] spake to
[1:01:37] me so it's obvious they were
[1:01:41] present in this great unveiling of Jesus
[1:01:45] Christ to sa they were there there were
[1:01:48] other let's just say there were other
[1:01:50] ones in church that
[1:01:53] morning and they saw the
[1:01:57] yeah and they heard a voice which can
[1:02:00] just mean sound amen but they didn't see
[1:02:03] any
[1:02:04] man but they saw a light and they heard
[1:02:07] a noise they heard a sound and then Paul
[1:02:10] later says they saw the light but they
[1:02:12] didn't hear the voice of him that spoke
[1:02:15] to me
[1:02:22] amen listen I I remember listening to
[1:02:25] the message M amen and when when I would
[1:02:28] be be listening to the message my my God
[1:02:30] was speaking to
[1:02:32] me and I would give that same tape that
[1:02:34] made me come alive to a friend or
[1:02:36] associate and I listened to them you
[1:02:38] know what they heard they heard a noise
[1:02:41] yeah right but they didn't hear the
[1:02:43] voice of him that spoke to
[1:02:45] me amen they could have been in church
[1:02:47] that day they could have been in the
[1:02:48] meeting amen they could have seen the
[1:02:50] pillar of fire move over the prophet am
[1:02:52] mean they could have seen the
[1:02:53] manifestations of the son of man on the
[1:02:55] platform and they could have seen the
[1:02:56] telling of your history and the raising
[1:02:58] of the dead and opening of the blind
[1:03:00] eyes amen no matter how many men were
[1:03:02] there at the opening of the word amen
[1:03:05] they didn't hear the voice that spoke to
[1:03:08] me because he came to unveil himself to
[1:03:11] his bride as
[1:03:14] individuals so he came and preached it
[1:03:18] openly but
[1:03:23] privately and and friends I can
[1:03:26] understand how frustrating this could
[1:03:28] be to somebody who could hear the noise
[1:03:31] but not the voice that spoke to
[1:03:35] Paul I I don't know what to do about it
[1:03:39] and I don't know how to fix it Paul
[1:03:42] couldn't fix
[1:03:44] it
[1:03:47] amen they saw a light I mean they were
[1:03:50] there for the impact of this
[1:03:53] meeting and they saw the bright light
[1:03:56] they heard
[1:03:58] something but they didn't hear what Paul
[1:04:01] heard amen
[1:04:05] amen it's why sometimes you could walk
[1:04:08] out of the same service and you heard
[1:04:10] two different
[1:04:14] messages and there's no way to fix that
[1:04:17] it's going to take God to fix
[1:04:21] that many times I think you know if I
[1:04:23] could just explain it more clearly
[1:04:26] if I wasn't
[1:04:27] so
[1:04:29] limited or if I didn't get confused or I
[1:04:32] didn't leave that part
[1:04:34] out listen you don't know what
[1:04:36] consternation we go through afterwards
[1:04:37] when you think what what I forgot to
[1:04:39] mention that and I didn't tie those two
[1:04:41] points together and I left it in
[1:04:43] confusion oh God forgive me I messed up
[1:04:46] everything but who's to say we messed up
[1:04:49] everything who's to say God still didn't
[1:04:51] speak to who he's supposed to speak
[1:04:54] to amen
[1:04:56] all men heard something and all men saw
[1:04:58] something but only one got the
[1:05:02] message
[1:05:04] amen so
[1:05:07] Paul he goes on let's let's just turn to
[1:05:11] Galatians chapter 1
[1:05:29] Galatians chap 1 verse 15 Paul says but
[1:05:33] when it pleased God who separated me
[1:05:36] from my mother's wom and called me by
[1:05:37] his grace to reveal his son in me that I
[1:05:41] might preach him among the Heathen
[1:05:43] immediately I conferred not with flesh
[1:05:45] and blood the Apostle Paul is saying
[1:05:48] when God determined that it was time
[1:05:51] that he would unveil the mystery of my
[1:05:54] life yeah
[1:05:56] what was what was it he was going to
[1:05:59] unveil to
[1:06:00] Paul he says when it I'm going to go
[1:06:03] back and read again in verse 15 when it
[1:06:04] pleased God who separated me from my
[1:06:06] mother's wound and called me by his
[1:06:08] grace to reveal his son in me amen what
[1:06:13] did he call Paul
[1:06:15] for to reveal his son in
[1:06:18] him he was called to reveal Jesus Christ
[1:06:22] to the people amen and he did that amen
[1:06:25] amen and when he did that when he was
[1:06:27] called to reveal the son he couldn't
[1:06:29] confer with man he couldn't go get it
[1:06:31] from anybody he had to go buy himself
[1:06:33] into Arabia and he had to count
[1:06:35] everything he learned as dong and
[1:06:37] relearn from Christ himself what the
[1:06:39] message was amen because it's it's not
[1:06:42] going to be it's not going to be
[1:06:44] conferring with man amen that's going to
[1:06:46] produce that although God can use man
[1:06:48] like he used ananas like he used Paul to
[1:06:50] preach it to all the Gentiles God can
[1:06:52] use man but it's not conferring with man
[1:06:55] that'll do anything when it's time for
[1:06:57] Christ to reveal himself in you amen
[1:06:59] then you have to get alone with Christ
[1:07:02] and Christ has to teach you the messag
[1:07:05] amen and it may not be the backside of
[1:07:08] the desert in Arabia for you amen it may
[1:07:10] feel like the backside of the desert
[1:07:12] when God separates you from everything
[1:07:13] you ever knew amen you feel isolated
[1:07:15] from every friend you ever had amen but
[1:07:17] really and God can be using the
[1:07:19] mouthpiece of a man from a pull pit
[1:07:21] that's not what we're talking about but
[1:07:22] it's got to be Christ revealing the
[1:07:24] message to you like he did
[1:07:26] Paul because what was the purpose of him
[1:07:29] calling Paul to reveal the son in him so
[1:07:33] that he would be revealing Jesus Christ
[1:07:35] to the
[1:07:36] world
[1:07:40] Amen and then the Apostle Paul would
[1:07:44] pick this understanding up and this is
[1:07:46] where uh we've talked about it so many
[1:07:48] times but when brother Brandon would
[1:07:49] come to Christ is the mystery of God
[1:07:50] revealed his opening scriptures context
[1:07:53] would be Colossians chapter 1 most of
[1:07:54] the chapter and but he would highlight
[1:07:56] this verse Christ in you the hope of
[1:07:59] glory because Paul realized why he was
[1:08:02] called to reveal
[1:08:05] Christ then he realized what what the
[1:08:07] great purpose was that's why he says I'm
[1:08:09] travailing in birth again till Christ be
[1:08:11] formed in you and it's Christ in you the
[1:08:15] hope of glory to the individual in an
[1:08:19] unveiling of God again brother R says
[1:08:21] now then when when we become part of him
[1:08:24] as you are the Veil that veils him you
[1:08:27] are part of him as long as Christ is in
[1:08:29] you as Christ was of God because God was
[1:08:31] in him made him
[1:08:34] God and as Christ is in you the hope of
[1:08:37] glory you become part of Christ he that
[1:08:40] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:08:42] shall he also you become part of Christ
[1:08:45] as long as Christ is hid in you then
[1:08:48] it's a veil to the unbeliever but you
[1:08:51] know he's in
[1:08:52] you here's the next sentence you are
[1:08:56] templ Christ that's behind the veil the
[1:09:01] skin so what do you become the
[1:09:05] Temple of Christ is that what Paul
[1:09:08] teaches
[1:09:12] us he says then behind because of this
[1:09:16] Veil The Veil again in human flesh hides
[1:09:20] God the word from the unbeliever
[1:09:26] where is
[1:09:27] Christ if you've been born again by the
[1:09:30] spirit of God Christ is in you you're
[1:09:33] templ in Christ but he's veiled to the
[1:09:36] unbelievers because of your
[1:09:39] flesh because your flesh is just like
[1:09:41] their
[1:09:43] flesh our flesh is like anybody else's
[1:09:46] flesh but it's behind the veil remember
[1:09:49] when when it was time for the for them
[1:09:51] to take the word that came from moses'
[1:09:53] mouth and they wrote In the book and was
[1:09:55] time to put it behind the veil they
[1:09:57] build a tabernacle and the Tabernacle in
[1:09:59] the wilderness is representative of
[1:10:01] Jesus Christ it's representative of a
[1:10:02] person and it has many ways it's
[1:10:04] representative of
[1:10:05] us because there's three parts the outer
[1:10:08] Court the inner Court the holy of holies
[1:10:10] and we have our body and our spirit in
[1:10:11] our soul but when it come time to put it
[1:10:14] back behind that Veil behind that Temple
[1:10:17] amen they had to go gather material and
[1:10:20] they gather this material they grabbed
[1:10:22] material that was like other material
[1:10:24] they took they took took Ram skins died
[1:10:26] red they took wool and wo it together
[1:10:29] amen and there was a selection of wool
[1:10:31] they took from some sheep and not from
[1:10:33] others amen they took skin from some
[1:10:36] Rams but not all the Rams yeah you
[1:10:39] understand what I'm saying they they
[1:10:41] they there was a selection of where the
[1:10:43] veil was going to be amen so the wool
[1:10:46] that was selected to be woven together
[1:10:48] to become the tapestry amen that would
[1:10:50] separate the holy place from the holy of
[1:10:51] holies amen that wool didn't select
[1:10:54] itself somebody else selected
[1:10:57] it and it was wool like any other wool
[1:11:00] that come off any other sheep it wasn't
[1:11:02] special wool it wasn't selected because
[1:11:04] it was nicer wool and wider wool and and
[1:11:07] com from nicer Lambs we like these sheep
[1:11:10] better yeah it was just selected amen
[1:11:14] but as it was selected it became the
[1:11:16] veil yeah it became the veil amen that
[1:11:21] was veiling what that was veiling the
[1:11:23] word and the life of the word was behind
[1:11:25] behind that Veil and it was a veil
[1:11:27] between the people amen and God and God
[1:11:30] was living behind the veil God was there
[1:11:33] God was present and God was manifesting
[1:11:35] out from behind the
[1:11:38] veil but it doesn't do any good for the
[1:11:40] veil to get proud about being the
[1:11:43] veil
[1:11:45] right how did you become the veil listen
[1:11:48] I don't
[1:11:49] know one day I'm on the back of a
[1:11:53] sheep next day somebody wrestles that
[1:11:55] sheep to the ground and listen the
[1:11:57] process wasn't pleasant I mean shears
[1:11:59] and separation and all of a sudden I
[1:12:01] thrown in a bag with other wool and I
[1:12:02] have no idea what's going on and then
[1:12:04] they took me out and they did all kinds
[1:12:06] of things to me I was stretched out and
[1:12:09] changed in form and changed in color and
[1:12:11] all this stuff and next thing I know I'm
[1:12:13] woven together and then I'm hung up
[1:12:17] here that's what we are friends that's
[1:12:20] what this guy is amen just the veil we
[1:12:25] can't take pride in the
[1:12:26] veil but the
[1:12:29] Veil The Veil could see both
[1:12:33] sides amen amen the veil could see
[1:12:38] outside and the veil could see inside
[1:12:41] amen and we can't help that we can see
[1:12:44] outside and we can see
[1:12:46] inside amen and then know that the
[1:12:50] veil is hiding the shikina glory of God
[1:12:55] brother B makes this statement that I'd
[1:12:57] just like to read to you out of Christ
[1:12:59] as the mystery of God revealed says now
[1:13:01] notice god making himself known not
[1:13:04] we're not supposed to make converts to
[1:13:06] Christianity by a government but by the
[1:13:09] Revelation the Christ in you right
[1:13:12] because Paul realized he was going to
[1:13:13] reveal his son in me Christ in you as
[1:13:16] God was in Christ as God was in Christ
[1:13:18] Christ in you when what God did in
[1:13:21] Christ Christ does in you what signs did
[1:13:23] God in Christ Christ does in
[1:13:25] you do you know what happened to Brock's
[1:13:28] cousin
[1:13:31] Abby she came in contact with a
[1:13:34] veil that was hiding
[1:13:39] Christ and listen the oh praise be to
[1:13:44] God Amen I I met her on Sunday and I
[1:13:47] talked to her on Sunday and I and I uh

[1:13:57] don't know the Brock you knew what he
[1:13:58] was like before but we sure love him now
[1:14:00] or something like that and she goes oh
[1:14:01] no oh no you don't know I know him he's
[1:14:04] completely
[1:14:06] changed I said maybe I'd like to talk to
[1:14:09] you after
[1:14:10] service and have a little interview
[1:14:14] and Brock was the same
[1:14:18] flesh the same characteristics even much
[1:14:21] of the same
[1:14:22] temperament but there was a different
[1:14:24] life on the end inside amen she
[1:14:27] recognized that he had become a veil and
[1:14:30] what was behind him was shakina Glory
[1:14:31] life and we don't make converts to
[1:14:33] Christ amen by sending out of track we
[1:14:36] make converts to Christ by The Life of
[1:14:37] Christ in us not by governments not by
[1:14:40] setting up an order not by bringing
[1:14:42] people into a form or order or ritual or
[1:14:44] a church structure that's never going to
[1:14:46] do it but what's going to happen is the
[1:14:48] same thing that happened to those that
[1:14:49] saw Paul coming along and Paul had
[1:14:51] Christ his son was being revealed in
[1:14:54] Paul yeah Paul was the veil and he had
[1:14:56] the mystery and he was letting it out
[1:14:58] and they saw whatever they saw in Paul
[1:15:01] brother benam said he was a stoop
[1:15:02] shouldered Hook New nose
[1:15:05] Jew but he had come in contact with the
[1:15:07] pillar of fire and now the sun was be
[1:15:09] revealing being revealed in him the veil
[1:15:12] was still the veil amen but the life on
[1:15:15] the inside had completely changed he was
[1:15:17] templ in
[1:15:19] Christ the same thing happened to Abby
[1:15:22] when she come in contact she told me she
[1:15:24] goes after talking to him she goes uh he
[1:15:27] was on fire and I got on fire and I had
[1:15:29] to come and see this church this place
[1:15:31] he goes that helped him
[1:15:34] change we don't make converts to
[1:15:36] Christianity by government amen but by
[1:15:39] Christ in
[1:15:42] you we are the veil amen and and God can
[1:15:46] God can allows the veil to come off
[1:15:47] somebody else's heart so that they can
[1:15:49] see what's behind the
[1:15:51] veil because what's behind the veil the
[1:15:54] word and the life of the
[1:15:58] word brother BR says in desperation the
[1:16:00] token is the
[1:16:02] token it's you and Christ as persons
[1:16:08] together I want read that again because
[1:16:10] it's such a it's such a strange
[1:16:13] statement the token is the token well
[1:16:16] okay it's you and Christ as persons
[1:16:22] together where is Christ
[1:16:26] he's a person with you together with you
[1:16:28] United with you veiled in
[1:16:33] you it's the Holy Spirit his life in you
[1:16:38] working his own life through
[1:16:42] you what is the token we know the token
[1:16:46] the token is the fullness of the Holy
[1:16:48] Ghost coming back in his
[1:16:50] church the token is the life of Jesus
[1:16:53] Christ in his his people that's the
[1:16:57] token and it comes to
[1:16:59] individuals it's not Collective it's
[1:17:01] individual his token is in you what is
[1:17:03] the token the token is the
[1:17:05] representation of his
[1:17:07] life or it's his life which is the
[1:17:09] representation of his blood of his death
[1:17:13] his token is his life and what is the
[1:17:15] token it's you and Christ as persons
[1:17:20] together now you're templ in Christ you
[1:17:23] are the veil that hides
[1:17:28] him and God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:17:31] says and you know what they thought
[1:17:33] about him what school did he come from
[1:17:36] what denomination is he with is he with
[1:17:38] the Pharisees or Sadducees or what more
[1:17:40] they had and he's speaking here of
[1:17:41] Elijah the
[1:17:42] prophet he didn't belong to any of them
[1:17:45] but he condemned the whole thing see God
[1:17:47] chose to do that but a simple man no
[1:17:49] education we have no place where he ever
[1:17:51] went to school we have nothing we know
[1:17:53] we have nothing about about him just a
[1:17:55] simple man but God was pleased to hide
[1:17:58] in that simple person God back there
[1:18:01] with this simple man hiding in a human
[1:18:03] being can you grasp it brother R is
[1:18:07] explaining Elijah and Elijah Ministry
[1:18:09] for a reason because he's trying to get
[1:18:11] us to see in this generation the
[1:18:13] parallel that Elijah had come back and
[1:18:15] brother said there's no record of Elijah
[1:18:17] no record of what school he came from or
[1:18:19] where he came from he was just Elijah
[1:18:20] the tishbite nobody even to this day
[1:18:22] really understands what that means
[1:18:25] but he but God was hiding brother said
[1:18:28] God was hiding in that humble man that
[1:18:30] simple man amen and we saw God hiding in
[1:18:34] another man in our generation and that
[1:18:36] was the other Elijah Ministry and
[1:18:38] William brandham God was hiding in that
[1:18:41] simple man amen and the man was the veil
[1:18:44] but what was behind the veil was
[1:18:47] God he was templ in Christ God was being
[1:18:50] revealed in
[1:18:52] him did it make brother Brenham perfect
[1:18:54] perfect in every way absolutely not
[1:18:57] don't forget the one who was templ
[1:18:59] Christ was still able to lie to a
[1:19:02] lawyer right amen
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:07] so you know for me that's such a
[1:19:09] blessing because it's a hard thing to
[1:19:11] say that behind me behind this
[1:19:14] Tabernacle amen is Christ that I've come
[1:19:16] in contact with the Living God I I came
[1:19:18] in contact with the pillar of fire and
[1:19:20] the pillar of fire woke me up to who I
[1:19:22] was and taught me the message and now
[1:19:24] I'm I'm templ in Christ you know what
[1:19:27] makes that hard to say it's hard to say
[1:19:29] because we know what all this guy goes
[1:19:30] through but I don't doubt it a bit and
[1:19:32] brother brandham and the fact that he
[1:19:34] went and lied to a lawyer amen listen
[1:19:36] you say but but you know the Holy Ghost
[1:19:38] corrected him he went back and made that
[1:19:39] right but could you imagine if you were
[1:19:41] standing there the day you saw it happen
[1:19:43] not knowing that God was going to cause
[1:19:45] him to make it
[1:19:48] right and listen brother
[1:19:52] benam he didn't make it right just
[1:19:56] because he decided to make it right he
[1:19:58] made it right because when he went to
[1:19:59] lay hands on a baby that was sick God
[1:20:01] spoke to him and said how can you being
[1:20:03] a liar lay your hands on that
[1:20:07] baby it wasn't the goodness of the human
[1:20:10] person it was the goodness of God Amen
[1:20:15] it was the character of God Amen and it
[1:20:17] was a man who could surrender to the
[1:20:19] voice of God it wasn't the Perfection of
[1:20:22] the veil the veil was a veil it was
[1:20:24] flesh like any other flesh it was prone
[1:20:27] to corruption it was prone to error like
[1:20:29] any other body of Flesh brother Brenham
[1:20:31] said amen he said listen if you're
[1:20:34] looking for something to criticize
[1:20:35] you'll find it there's plenty to
[1:20:37] criticize and if you're looking for fail
[1:20:39] don't look at me he goes I'm a
[1:20:41] failure he said I make mistakes every
[1:20:44] day he goes I backslide all the time I
[1:20:46] don't remember the the numbers he put to
[1:20:48] it but he was still the
[1:20:51] veil he was still templ in Christ
[1:20:55] it was still Christ behind that
[1:20:59] Veil oh I thank God listen we make a
[1:21:03] pile of mistakes we'll make a pile more
[1:21:05] mistakes but it's the goodness of God
[1:21:08] that tells us we're
[1:21:09] wrong because why he wants to manifest
[1:21:13] himself through
[1:21:15] usen I think it's amazing that God can
[1:21:17] be so powerful and so perfect he can use
[1:21:20] such a horrible Veil
[1:21:25] yeah I think it's amazing that he is so
[1:21:29] powerful his light is so bright and he's
[1:21:32] so perfect in every way that he can wrap
[1:21:35] himself in one of the most horrible
[1:21:37] veils
[1:21:39] ever and still manifest his
[1:21:43] life it's not the quality of the veil
[1:21:47] it's the quality of the life Behind the
[1:21:49] Veil
[1:21:57] oh praise
[1:22:00] God don't always
[1:22:02] know what to say or how to say it but I
[1:22:05] just know
[1:22:07] God I know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:22:10] what God's program is for this hour
[1:22:12] because he's revealed it in the message
[1:22:15] I don't fully comprehend obviously
[1:22:16] there's a million details we don't know
[1:22:18] but we know for sure that God wants to
[1:22:20] live in his
[1:22:21] people and he wants to be manifest and
[1:22:23] seen in his people people yeah and I
[1:22:26] believe by a revelation not by conduct
[1:22:29] not by temperament not by Good Deeds but
[1:22:32] I believe by Revelation I'm one of those
[1:22:35] people and I look at my veil sometimes
[1:22:39] and I think how
[1:22:41] God but I didn't pick me he picked
[1:22:46] me neither can I perfect me only he can
[1:22:51] all I can do is the best I can to stay
[1:22:53] surrendered
[1:22:55] and even that I can't do really good it
[1:22:58] takes his life in me to accomplish
[1:23:02] it brother brand
[1:23:07] says I'm just going to quote not not
[1:23:10] brother B but out of Mark 16 in the
[1:23:13] resurrection of Jesus
[1:23:15] Christ when Jesus was first be made
[1:23:18] manifest it was first to Mary
[1:23:21] Magdalene she's the first one that will
[1:23:23] come in contact with the resurrected
[1:23:25] Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene knew
[1:23:28] Jesus she'd followed him from City to
[1:23:29] City serving him she was one of the
[1:23:31] women that were serving him and cooking
[1:23:32] food and taking care of him and she knew
[1:23:34] him quite well but when Christ first
[1:23:38] represented himself to Mary Magdalene he
[1:23:40] was in the form of a
[1:23:43] gardener and she assumed he was the
[1:23:47] gardener he had taken on another
[1:23:50] Veil she didn't recognize
[1:23:52] him and the the veil that he took on
[1:23:57] what the veil was hiding from her eyes
[1:23:59] who it was from her human eyes she
[1:24:03] didn't know that it was Jesus Christ
[1:24:05] standing there talking to her and she's
[1:24:07] saying sir show me where he
[1:24:11] is show me where they've laid his body
[1:24:14] so that I can go and fetch
[1:24:16] him she's looking for Jesus Christ and
[1:24:19] she's talking to Jesus Christ and she's
[1:24:21] asking Jesus Christ to show her where
[1:24:23] the body of Jesus Christ
[1:24:27] is I don't know if any of those
[1:24:29] scriptures ever Marvel you but they
[1:24:30] Marvel
[1:24:32] me what what was blinding her to the
[1:24:35] life that was before her it was the
[1:24:39] veil but then he
[1:24:42] spoke and he called her by
[1:24:45] nameen and he said Mary and when he
[1:24:48] called her name listen brother bam we
[1:24:51] we've been through this many times but
[1:24:53] brother bam talks about when he called
[1:24:54] your name and revealing the Mysteries is
[1:24:56] calling the name amen and when God's
[1:24:58] revealing himself and revealing this
[1:24:59] mystery he's calling your name he's not
[1:25:02] saying Chad and Bob and Ted and it's not
[1:25:05] that's not what he's saying what he's
[1:25:07] what he's doing what what was it to call
[1:25:09] Mary's name that was an identification
[1:25:12] he was identifying her that he knew her
[1:25:15] and the way he knew her and understood
[1:25:17] who she was and the way he called her
[1:25:19] name she knew in the way that he called
[1:25:22] her name she knew that was the Lord she
[1:25:24] turned around and said Rabon teacher
[1:25:26] amen and she fell at his
[1:25:29] feet amen listen God Has Come to Us in
[1:25:32] the form amen he's come into the form of
[1:25:35] his word he's come through the form of a
[1:25:36] prophet and many times he's come to us
[1:25:38] in a form of another human being that
[1:25:40] was witnessing to us about the
[1:25:43] message amen and we didn't recognize who
[1:25:46] was talking to us we didn't recognize
[1:25:48] the life behind the veil amen but all of
[1:25:50] a sudden the life behind the veil that
[1:25:52] knew us before the foundation of the
[1:25:54] world would call us with a true
[1:25:57] identification with who we really were
[1:25:59] and we knew when he called that name not
[1:26:02] Chad that's not the name amen the name
[1:26:05] is who he called who I was in his mind
[1:26:07] before the foundation of the world and
[1:26:09] when he called me with that
[1:26:10] identification something in me said
[1:26:12] that's
[1:26:14] Christ it's more than the veil that I
[1:26:17] see and listen supposing that he was a
[1:26:19] gardener and then he left her sight amen
[1:26:22] and listen what happened to that Veil
[1:26:25] what happened to The
[1:26:30] Gardener oh my goodness I have a pile of
[1:26:33] questions to ask when I get to heaven if
[1:26:35] if we have this kind of mind and we ask
[1:26:37] questions we may not ask anything I
[1:26:38] don't know but I got a pile of
[1:26:42] questions next we find him on the road
[1:26:45] to a mass and and the market says he
[1:26:47] appeared to two others in another form
[1:26:51] yeah right in another form what behind
[1:26:54] another Veil it was the resurrected
[1:26:58] Jesus Christ his resurrected life amen
[1:27:00] fulfilling the word and he come to them
[1:27:03] but their eyes were beholden that they
[1:27:04] couldn't know him
[1:27:06] yeah and they knew him they talked to
[1:27:09] him they loved him they spent time with
[1:27:11] him but they didn't know who it was that
[1:27:13] they were walking with because he
[1:27:15] presented himself to them behind a
[1:27:17] different Veil than what they were used
[1:27:19] to yeah
[1:27:21] amen and then he talks to them along the
[1:27:23] way and they confessed later that their
[1:27:25] hearts were burning and he opened to
[1:27:28] them the
[1:27:31] scriptures didn't our hearts burn within
[1:27:33] us as he took to us along the way
[1:27:34] opening unto us the
[1:27:36] scriptures and they don't know that this
[1:27:38] is the Lord whom they're
[1:27:40] mourning they don't know this is the one
[1:27:42] that they think they're separated from
[1:27:44] and he's no more separated than from
[1:27:46] them than than he's right
[1:27:48] there and there he goes why are you
[1:27:51] downcast why are you so sad
[1:27:54] what's wrong with you I'm right here
[1:27:57] yeah what is it you're mourning about
[1:27:59] what is this you're talking about along
[1:28:00] the way don't you know what's happened a
[1:28:03] prophet and mighty indeed and whoa whoa
[1:28:05] whoa listen we're going through the same
[1:28:07] thing now God where are you he's all
[1:28:09] around us
[1:28:10] friends he's
[1:28:13] here he's behind other
[1:28:18] veils he's
[1:28:20] here behind that Veil and then you know
[1:28:23] that they have the dialogue and they
[1:28:25] bite him in and then he goes and he does
[1:28:29] something before them that would be an
[1:28:32] identification he breaks the bread in a
[1:28:34] certain way brother said he had done
[1:28:36] something like he had done it before
[1:28:39] then it said their eyes were
[1:28:41] open and they saw him they knew it was
[1:28:44] the
[1:28:45] Lord I have a pile of questions there
[1:28:48] too did the form change or did their
[1:28:51] understanding change did the facial
[1:28:54] structures all of a sudden rearrange in
[1:28:57] that vessel he was using or did they
[1:28:59] actually catch a revelation of who this
[1:29:02] is I don't know the answer to that but
[1:29:04] either one's
[1:29:06] amazing either one is certainly amazing
[1:29:09] and then he vanished from their
[1:29:11] sight he vanished from their
[1:29:15] sight so what happened to that form yeah
[1:29:20] this is always my question what happened
[1:29:22] to that form
[1:29:27] then
[1:29:29] next we find them all hidden in a room
[1:29:32] together the doors being
[1:29:35] fastened next thing you know he's
[1:29:37] standing there in their
[1:29:39] midst only this time he's in another
[1:29:41] form again he's back in the form they
[1:29:44] last saw him in yeah with the nail
[1:29:46] scarred
[1:29:47] hands the the body they were accustomed
[1:29:50] to he came to them in the in the way
[1:29:55] that they knew him Amen in the image
[1:29:58] that they knew him and they came to him
[1:30:01] behind closed doors and he revealed
[1:30:03] himself to them he said it is
[1:30:06] I come and touch my hands and thrust thy
[1:30:09] hand in my
[1:30:12] side and we know what happened to Thomas
[1:30:15] and we know he got a revelation he said
[1:30:17] my my Lord and my
[1:30:20] God and this was a private revelation of
[1:30:24] Jesus Christ
[1:30:25] himself not now in another form but he
[1:30:28] himself comes behind closed doors and
[1:30:30] reveals himself to them
[1:30:33] personally in his fullness that they
[1:30:36] understood at that
[1:30:38] time and so we we look at we look at
[1:30:41] this and we we realize that in other
[1:30:44] form in another
[1:30:45] form he opened to them the
[1:30:48] scriptures but now behind closed doors
[1:30:51] in private he comes to them and says
[1:30:53] it's me
[1:30:55] and then he opens their understanding to
[1:30:59] understand the
[1:31:01] scriptures listen God has used many
[1:31:04] forms forms of preachers and forms of
[1:31:06] friends to open to us the
[1:31:09] scriptures but the only one that can
[1:31:12] open our understanding to understand
[1:31:14] those scriptures is when he meets you
[1:31:15] behind the closed
[1:31:17] walls of your
[1:31:19] house when he shows up and says it's me
[1:31:23] see my my nails Prince see my hands see
[1:31:26] my side this is me and in that private
[1:31:30] meeting with Christ behind your Veil and
[1:31:34] your holy of holies when he says it's me
[1:31:37] he may use another form to open the
[1:31:39] scriptures but when he opens your
[1:31:40] understanding to understand the
[1:31:41] scriptures it's when he comes into your
[1:31:44] house and says it's
[1:31:49] me he goes
[1:31:51] on and Miss Christ's the mystery of God
[1:31:55] revealed he says now look Christ in you
[1:31:58] makes him the center of life of the
[1:32:02] Revelation Christ's life in you makes
[1:32:04] him the center of the Revelation Christ
[1:32:07] in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:32:09] complete revelation of Christ Christ in
[1:32:12] you makes you the complete revelation of
[1:32:14] the whole thing see what God is trying
[1:32:16] to do what is the new birth then you say
[1:32:20] well brother bam what is the new birth
[1:32:21] it is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:32:23] Christ personally to
[1:32:26] you not you joined a church you shook a
[1:32:29] hand you done something different you
[1:32:31] set a Creed you promis to live by a code
[1:32:33] of rules but Christ the Bible he is the
[1:32:35] word that was revealed to you and no
[1:32:37] matter what anybody says what takes
[1:32:39] place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever
[1:32:42] it might be it's Christ in you that is
[1:32:45] the Revelation that the church was built
[1:32:48] upon it's when
[1:32:50] Christ not in another form
[1:32:54] in another form he may open to you the
[1:32:58] scriptures but when he comes into your
[1:33:01] form he opens your understanding he
[1:33:05] gives you a revelation this is
[1:33:08] him this is him and it's him in
[1:33:13] me and the rising of the sun he says in
[1:33:16] him we become part of him the Easter the
[1:33:19] re the revealed Secret Of God like it
[1:33:21] was then of life after death we are now
[1:33:23] now alive who were once dead in sin and
[1:33:25] trespasses the true Easter seal has
[1:33:28] broke death from around me and I'm alive
[1:33:31] the Easter seal at the beginning broke
[1:33:33] the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter
[1:33:34] seal that he was sealed up and man when
[1:33:37] they died was gone but he broke that
[1:33:38] seal and revealed the secret and now God
[1:33:41] by his holy spirit has broke the seal
[1:33:43] from around our lives and Christ is
[1:33:45] revealed as he lives in us for we are
[1:33:47] quickened with him what is the great
[1:33:49] revelation of this day Christ in you the
[1:33:52] hope of glory amen and you become the
[1:33:55] veil you're templ him behind your flesh
[1:33:58] and it doesn't have to become special
[1:34:00] flesh that's right it can be just plain
[1:34:03] old flesh it doesn't have to become
[1:34:06] perfect flesh it can still be flawed
[1:34:09] flesh because that's not what we're
[1:34:11] looking at we're looking at the life
[1:34:12] that's behind the
[1:34:14] veil we're looking at the word that's
[1:34:16] laying there with the shakina glory of
[1:34:19] God there to make it live that's the
[1:34:22] reality that's where the temple of God
[1:34:27] is amen let's turn to 1 Corinthians
[1:34:40] 13 1 Corinthians
[1:34:50] 13 1 Corinthians 13:10 but when that
[1:34:54] which is perfect is come then that which
[1:34:56] is in part shall be done
[1:34:58] away when I was a child I spake as a
[1:35:01] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:35:03] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:35:06] away childish things for now we see
[1:35:09] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[1:35:11] face now I know in part but then shall I
[1:35:15] know even as also I am
[1:35:19] known he says when that which is perfect
[1:35:21] is come and brother benam says in what
[1:35:23] we do have today is the perfect
[1:35:25] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:35:28] Vindication he says we look into a glass
[1:35:30] Darkly that means a mirror Darkly we've
[1:35:32] been looking into the word amen and it's
[1:35:34] been a bit obscure but at the opening of
[1:35:36] the seals he was going to take the
[1:35:38] obscurity away from the
[1:35:41] scriptures he was going to I I say it
[1:35:44] this way he was going to clean the glass
[1:35:47] amen by the message of the hour he was
[1:35:49] going to take what was jumbled up and
[1:35:51] what was obscure and he was going to
[1:35:52] clean it all back and bring it back to
[1:35:55] the original the original status that it
[1:35:57] was originally given in and this word
[1:36:00] was intended to be a mirror but through
[1:36:02] denominationalism man's ideas all kinds
[1:36:04] of clutter got attached to it it got
[1:36:07] laid up in an attic it got dust all over
[1:36:09] it had smears and fingerprints and
[1:36:11] everything else and you would look at it
[1:36:12] and you could never see clearly what you
[1:36:13] were looking at but at the opening of
[1:36:15] the seals in this message he came and he
[1:36:17] and He restored the mirror back to what
[1:36:19] it was supposed to
[1:36:21] be he says for now we see through a
[1:36:23] Darkly but then when when the perfect
[1:36:26] interpretation of the word has been come
[1:36:28] back to us been
[1:36:30] revealed but then face to face now I
[1:36:33] know in part but then shall I know even
[1:36:35] as also I am
[1:36:38] known God always knew about
[1:36:43] me God always knew about me the question
[1:36:47] wasn't in God's mind the question was in
[1:36:50] my
[1:36:52] mind God God always knew what he would
[1:36:54] do with me God always knew who I was
[1:36:57] amen God always knew that I would become
[1:36:59] part of that Temple he always knew he
[1:37:02] would use my veil if I'm a Child of God
[1:37:05] he always knew he would use my veil to
[1:37:06] manifest himself I didn't know
[1:37:09] it amen but he came and He restored the
[1:37:14] word so that I wasn't looking at a dirty
[1:37:17] mirror
[1:37:18] anymore so that I was looking at the
[1:37:20] word correctly and when I looked at the
[1:37:21] correctly I found out it was
[1:37:25] me it was me he wants to use I can say
[1:37:28] he used Paul he used Paul look at what
[1:37:32] he did in the first church age look what
[1:37:33] he did in the Corinthians look what he
[1:37:34] did in Peter praise God I saw that look
[1:37:37] what he did in brother brandham that was
[1:37:38] beautiful too but he wanted me to catch
[1:37:40] a higher Revelation that what he did in
[1:37:42] Paul he wants to do in me what he did in
[1:37:44] brother brandom he wants to do in me he
[1:37:46] used the veil to Temple himself to live
[1:37:49] his life behind the veil he wants to do
[1:37:51] the same thing in you and I and when the
[1:37:54] message came to clear that mirror we
[1:37:55] could get a reflection it wasn't just
[1:37:57] Paul he wanted to use it wasn't only
[1:37:59] Paul that would reveal the sun he wants
[1:38:01] to use me to reveal this sign he's got a
[1:38:04] body and he's got members of that body
[1:38:06] and he wants me to be one of those
[1:38:10] members and then when we're turn to the
[1:38:13] Lord the veil is taken off of our
[1:38:17] heart and we could see yes Christ
[1:38:24] man I have just one more thought that
[1:38:26] I've been meditating on that I want to
[1:38:28] share as we wind down and
[1:38:31] close brother vom in questions and
[1:38:34] answers on the seals in 1963 it's a
[1:38:36] Sunday morning right between the Sixth
[1:38:38] Seal and the seventh seal he does
[1:38:40] questions and answers and he gets this
[1:38:43] question said brother
[1:38:45] brandham if this question is not fit
[1:38:48] does not fit don't answer brother said
[1:38:50] that's nice I appreciate that he said
[1:38:53] what children what children go in the
[1:38:55] Rapture if any small ones thank you so
[1:39:00] the question is what happens at the
[1:39:02] Rapture time with little children or
[1:39:04] babies obviously they've not been
[1:39:06] converted yet would you agree not not
[1:39:10] prayed a sinner's prayer not repented of
[1:39:14] anything and he
[1:39:17] says he said look when God puts a name
[1:39:21] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:39:24] foundation of the world there's not
[1:39:26] nothing in the world can rub it
[1:39:28] out because it's wrote with the ink of
[1:39:31] the blood of Christ be it this big that
[1:39:35] big that big or whatever it might be it
[1:39:38] it goes just the
[1:39:41] same remember when uh several weeks ago
[1:39:44] brother Stan price was here and he made
[1:39:46] the statement he says he used he
[1:39:48] referred to the quote he says in the
[1:39:50] quote where brother B says you was never
[1:39:53] saved on any certain day you were always
[1:39:57] saved how can I say I was always saved
[1:40:00] because you were in the Lamb's Book of
[1:40:03] Life if you were saved you were in the
[1:40:05] Lamb's Book of Life so when were when
[1:40:08] were you saved I mean I know it comes
[1:40:09] down to technicalities we have an
[1:40:12] experience here and that experience is
[1:40:14] for our understanding and our growth and
[1:40:16] for a manifestation of the word so
[1:40:17] there's a manifestation of that but the
[1:40:19] reality of
[1:40:21] it if I could say it this way the
[1:40:23] reality is not the drama that's being
[1:40:25] played the reality is what played out in
[1:40:27] God's mind the reality is in the Lamb's
[1:40:30] Book of Life the reality we're just
[1:40:32] we're just reflecting that reality he
[1:40:34] said this is the negative that is the
[1:40:36] positive amen so he says you was never
[1:40:39] saved on any certain day you were always
[1:40:41] saved and now they ask about babies what
[1:40:44] happens to young children in the Rapture
[1:40:46] will any of them go because they didn't
[1:40:47] say a prayer they didn't confess you as
[1:40:49] Lord they didn't get converted amen but
[1:40:52] at the rapture
[1:40:53] amen it doesn't matter everybody that's
[1:40:56] in the Lamb's Book of Life amen all
[1:40:58] that's part of the elect predestinated
[1:41:00] seed will go in the
[1:41:03] Rapture all those who were old enough to
[1:41:05] come to repentance would right but those
[1:41:08] who are not old enough Amen to even
[1:41:10] speak they're going to go anyways God
[1:41:14] but this is the statement that began I
[1:41:15] began to look at when he made this
[1:41:17] statement he
[1:41:19] says
[1:41:21] uh he said God puts a name on the Lamb's
[1:41:24] Book of Life before the foundation world
[1:41:26] there's not nothing in the world can rub
[1:41:28] it out because it's wrote with the ink
[1:41:30] of the blood of Christ
[1:41:35] amen I began to look at that and I know
[1:41:38] how brother brandham speaking like I
[1:41:40] know he's speaking
[1:41:42] symbolically but I began to look at that
[1:41:44] and said those names were sealed under
[1:41:48] the blood of the
[1:41:50] Lamb they were written in the ink of the
[1:41:54] blood of the Lamb is that what the
[1:41:56] prophet tells
[1:41:58] us but that blood wasn't shed until ad.
[1:42:04] 33 so how did he get that blood to write
[1:42:08] names in a
[1:42:13] book now we realize we we've been taught
[1:42:16] this we realize that the Book of
[1:42:18] Revelation is a book of
[1:42:19] symbols that God is using symbols to
[1:42:22] teach us truth
[1:42:23] the truths are greater than the
[1:42:25] symbols I hope you don't think I'm
[1:42:27] sacriligious for saying that but the
[1:42:29] truth is beyond the symbol because the
[1:42:31] truth is the reality the symbol is a
[1:42:33] reflection of that reality for
[1:42:36] understanding so he's saying a book like
[1:42:38] like there may be a book there may not
[1:42:40] be a book I I don't know like you have
[1:42:42] to ask questions like what paper does he
[1:42:44] have what ink did he write did he write
[1:42:46] with a quill did he write with his
[1:42:48] finger like when brother bam saw the
[1:42:50] vision amen of when he was criticizing
[1:42:52] the woman in the vision of the blood of
[1:42:54] Jesus Christ around the earth and his
[1:42:56] sins hitting that amen he saw his wrap
[1:42:59] sheet he saw all his transgressions and
[1:43:01] he saw Jesus dip his finger in his side
[1:43:03] and write pardoned on on his sheet well
[1:43:06] God was showing him symbolically what
[1:43:08] had happened did God ever really write
[1:43:10] pardoned on a sheet a list of offenses
[1:43:12] that he had right I don't know maybe he
[1:43:15] did when did he write it if he ever
[1:43:17] wrote it he wrote it before the
[1:43:19] foundation of the world which means he
[1:43:21] already had a list of your offenses
[1:43:26] I don't know the answer to these
[1:43:27] questions all I know is the truth is
[1:43:28] beyond the
[1:43:30] symbols and the truth is he wrote your
[1:43:33] name in the indelible inerasable perfect
[1:43:36] ink of the blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:43:39] blood of the lamb but yet there was no
[1:43:42] physical blood yet to write that
[1:43:47] name that's why so there there's a
[1:43:50] there's a message that becomes so vital
[1:43:52] brother B said he could not preach the
[1:43:53] token till after the seals yeah because
[1:43:57] he begins to show us the reality there's
[1:43:59] a greater reality to everything and he
[1:44:02] says the blood represents the
[1:44:05] life he said that blood that Jesus shed
[1:44:09] ran down the cross and Spilled into the
[1:44:11] Judean soil and he said it turned back
[1:44:14] into the elements of the food and the
[1:44:16] things that he ate right now that's
[1:44:19] that's what brother brandom said amen
[1:44:21] and I don't mean to make that Sac
[1:44:22] religious that's the most precious blood
[1:44:24] that's ever touched the Earth and that
[1:44:27] blood was an exchange rate price it was
[1:44:29] an exchange of money his blood for my
[1:44:31] sins yeah and that was real blood and
[1:44:33] that was that was human blood that was
[1:44:35] created by God so it was the blood of
[1:44:37] God
[1:44:38] Amen but that blood was not the blood
[1:44:43] that he wrote my name in the Lamb's Book
[1:44:45] of Life
[1:44:47] with that blood represented the blood
[1:44:53] just stay with me for a minute
[1:44:55] amen the blood that I receive today is
[1:44:59] not that blood because he said that chem
[1:45:02] he said that blood was a chemistry and
[1:45:05] that chemistry went back into the soil
[1:45:08] he said but what I receive was the life
[1:45:10] of that blood so when I receive the life
[1:45:13] of that blood amen I receive the effect
[1:45:17] of the blood and the effect of the blood
[1:45:19] is my Redemption so that's why the life
[1:45:22] becomes the token the token is if you go
[1:45:25] to the bus brother B says and you don't
[1:45:27] go give the bus driver money because
[1:45:28] they don't want the bus driver robbed
[1:45:30] they don't want him to have a big bile
[1:45:31] of money so you go to a shed amen where
[1:45:33] they're locked behind iron bar bars you
[1:45:35] give them the money they drop it in
[1:45:37] their safe they give you a token the
[1:45:39] token represents the money but it's not
[1:45:40] the money
[1:45:43] righten so what we receive today is a
[1:45:46] token it's not the physical blood but it
[1:45:48] represents the physical blood the
[1:45:50] physical blood ran back into the Earth
[1:45:52] to redeem all of creation but the token
[1:45:54] I get was the life of that blood the
[1:45:56] life that created the blood the life
[1:45:58] that was living through the blood the
[1:45:59] life that continues on today that
[1:46:03] life is what we
[1:46:08] receive so what blood did he write my
[1:46:14] name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:46:19] with oh my goodness
[1:46:23] you know how sometimes brother BR says
[1:46:24] put your spiritual jackets
[1:46:28] on we got to look Beyond
[1:46:31] physical and see the spiritual reality
[1:46:34] behind
[1:46:35] it so keep that question in your mind
[1:46:38] what blood did he write my name and what
[1:46:41] name did he write does it say Chad
[1:46:45] Lamb it's a good question like I said I
[1:46:47] got piles of questions and I don't have
[1:46:50] all the answers but I realize some of my
[1:46:53] questions are carnal because of limited
[1:46:56] understanding I'm fixating on the symbol
[1:46:59] and I've missed the truth that's beyond
[1:47:01] the
[1:47:05] S and questions and answers on the seals
[1:47:08] again a little bit later he says now
[1:47:10] Jesus was slain about ad30 is that right
[1:47:12] it was about the middle of the year I
[1:47:14] guess ad30 now but the Bible said that
[1:47:16] he was slain before the world was ever
[1:47:18] created and your name when the Lamb's
[1:47:21] Book when the lamb was slain to redeem
[1:47:23] this book here's a great thing now I
[1:47:25] might call stimulation look when the
[1:47:27] lamb now remember the Bible said the
[1:47:29] Lamb's Book of Life was written before
[1:47:30] the foundation of the world and your
[1:47:32] name was put in it was in that book when
[1:47:34] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[1:47:36] of the world to redeem every name that
[1:47:38] was written in the book you got it now
[1:47:42] so when was the lamb slain before the
[1:47:44] foundation of the
[1:47:47] world but he was slain
[1:47:50] ad30 says
[1:47:53] because this is a reflection of
[1:47:57] that this on Earth is a manifestation of
[1:48:00] what's already taken place in the mind
[1:48:03] of God and so then I ask you which one
[1:48:06] is more
[1:48:08] real the one in heaven the Eternal God's
[1:48:12] thoughts this is a reflection of that
[1:48:14] and this is a manifestation of that but
[1:48:16] the more real is the
[1:48:21] original so he was slain before the
[1:48:24] foundation of the world to redeem every
[1:48:25] name that was written in that book see
[1:48:28] there ain't nothing out of order it's
[1:48:31] working just exactly like God's Big Time
[1:48:34] piece like a clock moving right around
[1:48:36] your name was put in there before the
[1:48:38] foundation of the world when the lamb
[1:48:39] was slain to redeem what was in the book
[1:48:43] and now he comes forward and takes the
[1:48:45] book to claim his
[1:48:46] Redemption so let's go to Revelation
[1:48:51] 138 there's a more I'd like to say on
[1:48:53] this but I just want to touch this
[1:48:56] thought in context of what we're talking
[1:49:00] about Revelation
[1:49:08] 13:8 it says and all that dwell upon the
[1:49:11] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[1:49:15] not written in the Book of Life of the
[1:49:20] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[1:49:24] world I love this
[1:49:26] wording CU many times we call it the
[1:49:28] Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life but
[1:49:32] I love the terminology here in the Book
[1:49:35] of Life of the
[1:49:38] lamb and and we realize Ephesians 1
[1:49:42] tells us that God has chosen Us in him
[1:49:46] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:49:49] so we were chose in him before the
[1:49:52] foundation of the world that we should
[1:49:54] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:49:57] love so God chose us in Christ Jesus
[1:50:01] before the foundation of the world and
[1:50:03] that's the same time he wrote our name
[1:50:06] in The Book of Life and he wrote it with
[1:50:09] the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:50:12] it's all been sealed behind Seven Seals
[1:50:15] so it's
[1:50:15] unchangeable in the end times is going
[1:50:17] to reveal at the opening seal is going
[1:50:19] to reveal the fact that it's been
[1:50:21] unchangeable all this
[1:50:23] time that's why it's been a sealed book
[1:50:26] that's open at the end can't be tampered
[1:50:28] with this has been God's decision from
[1:50:30] before the foundation of the world he's
[1:50:31] not making new decisions
[1:50:33] amen so so now we come to this book
[1:50:38] now and brother Brandon makes this
[1:50:40] statement in Christ is the mystery of
[1:50:42] God revealed he says now you see the
[1:50:44] seals when he was in his mediat tural
[1:50:46] work back there redeeming but someday he
[1:50:48] comes forth to get this book that he's
[1:50:51] redeemed and and all that's in his book
[1:50:54] would be
[1:51:01] him everything in the book is
[1:51:07] him but I thought my name was in that
[1:51:12] book and all that's in his book would be
[1:51:15] him for that's the believer the words in
[1:51:19] the book and the word is him
[1:51:25] amen it's the Book of Life of the
[1:51:30] Lamb or the Lamb's Book of
[1:51:34] Life it's the book of the Lamb's life
[1:51:38] amen so what kind of ink is my name
[1:51:42] written in in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:51:46] what kind of pen did he use how did he
[1:51:48] get the ink what kind of style did he
[1:51:51] write it in what language was it written
[1:51:53] and how big is it written how small is
[1:51:55] it written how big is the
[1:51:57] book the book is him amen that's right
[1:52:03] and everything in the book is him
[1:52:06] amen and the Believers in the book is
[1:52:10] the words in the book is him because he
[1:52:13] is the word amen and the believer is
[1:52:17] part of the word and they are the words
[1:52:19] that are in the book and brother Benham
[1:52:21] called This Book of redemption the Bible
[1:52:23] and he says you were in the Bible before
[1:52:24] the Bible was written so the Bible and
[1:52:27] the Lamb's Book of Life are the same
[1:52:29] thing the Bible and the Book of
[1:52:30] redemption are the same thing the Bible
[1:52:32] and your marriage certificate are the
[1:52:34] same thing the Bible and the record of
[1:52:36] the life of the Lamb are the same thing
[1:52:38] what ink were your name written in and
[1:52:40] what name was written in there it's his
[1:52:42] own life that he's sharing with
[1:52:46] you that's what's in the Lamb's Book of
[1:52:48] Life it's his life it's the record of
[1:52:51] him his life as he was going to bring it
[1:52:54] in manifestation upon the Earth through
[1:52:56] all the generations and collect it all
[1:52:58] up at the end day unite himself to his
[1:53:00] bride which is him male and female him
[1:53:03] to come back together to unite the book
[1:53:06] back together and return Christ to the
[1:53:10] Earth to
[1:53:12] rule what ink did you write your name in
[1:53:15] his blood what
[1:53:17] blood his
[1:53:20] life so what are are you yes part of his
[1:53:26] life if your name is written with the
[1:53:29] indelible ink of his blood that can
[1:53:32] never be rubbed out right amen that then
[1:53:35] your name is part of
[1:53:39] him you're part of his
[1:53:43] life not
[1:53:46] this but that seed Gene of God on the
[1:53:49] inside was an attribute of God that was
[1:53:52] is part of God's word that wants to be
[1:53:54] manifest what is Christ the anointed
[1:53:58] word God's word that he anointed to live
[1:54:02] in a certain day that's Christ that's
[1:54:04] why brother B said it was Christ in Noah
[1:54:06] it was Christ in Moses what was it you
[1:54:09] remember that was Christ and Moses
[1:54:12] before the New Birth yeah right amen
[1:54:16] remember he had to shed his blood to
[1:54:17] sanctify so that he could live in us
[1:54:19] before it was God above us then God With
[1:54:21] Us now it's God in us and that could
[1:54:22] only come after Calvary he could only
[1:54:24] live in man after Calvary so what was it
[1:54:27] Christ and Moses it was a seed or part
[1:54:29] of God's life that was in Moses it was
[1:54:31] the word that was in Moses that was
[1:54:34] living and when that word in Moses lived
[1:54:36] that was Christ
[1:54:39] amen what is it that's living in
[1:54:43] you what is it that what is what is the
[1:54:46] Holy Ghost come to Quicken you it's come
[1:54:48] to Quicken his own life that's already
[1:54:50] in you and how does he Quicken his life
[1:54:53] by bringing his life to Quicken his life
[1:54:56] because what's behind what's behind the
[1:54:58] veil amen the shakina glory of God Amen
[1:55:01] the very life of God comes and rest upon
[1:55:04] the word and brings the word into
[1:55:06] manifestation cuz what's in the inner
[1:55:09] chamber it's the word it's in the ark
[1:55:11] which is what his throne his place of
[1:55:14] rest is inside the believer in the holy
[1:55:17] of holies and there abides the word the
[1:55:20] Covenant the promise the Eternal promise
[1:55:23] of God from before the foundation of the
[1:55:25] world one of those words that was
[1:55:27] written in the Lamb's Book of Life is In
[1:55:29] The Ark in your heart in his resting
[1:55:31] place and he brings his shakina glory
[1:55:34] behind your Veil to make that portion of
[1:55:37] the word live amen and that's why your
[1:55:41] flesh that was born wrong will always be
[1:55:43] wrong that's condemned and must be made
[1:55:46] over that's why it's the veil yeah amen
[1:55:50] because behind the veil
[1:55:52] his word which you're a part of because
[1:55:57] the believer is the words in the
[1:56:00] book what words my
[1:56:03] name and it may not be Chad
[1:56:06] lam it might just be the portion of
[1:56:09] Christ's life that I'm supposed to
[1:56:11] represent on this Earth that's my name
[1:56:14] cuz that's my what's your name it's your
[1:56:17] identification amen what is my
[1:56:19] identification my identification is Mrs
[1:56:21] Jesus Jesus Christ I've took on his
[1:56:23] identification so he's in me and there's
[1:56:26] a part of him in me that has to live in
[1:56:28] this day maybe that's my name on the
[1:56:30] book my
[1:56:32] identification what I'm supposed to
[1:56:34] represent on this Earth and where is it
[1:56:37] behind the
[1:56:38] veil written with what kind of ink his
[1:56:42] own life it can't change it's
[1:56:47] him am that's why I receive the token
[1:56:53] listen if that name was written in the
[1:56:57] ink of his blood before the foundation
[1:56:58] of the world that's his
[1:57:01] life his life was come and made flesh so
[1:57:04] that that blood could spill to pay the
[1:57:06] price of redemption for creation it had
[1:57:08] to become a part of creation to redeem
[1:57:11] creation but that physical blood was a
[1:57:14] chemistry but that chemistry was
[1:57:16] reflecting a life the life is the
[1:57:20] reality the life is the I say the higher
[1:57:24] reality and that was part of that life
[1:57:26] that wrote my name in that
[1:57:28] book what is that that's being expressed
[1:57:32] Today part of that life that was on that
[1:57:36] book that's why a baby in the Rapture is
[1:57:41] going to go in the Rapture if it's part
[1:57:44] of the Life of
[1:57:48] Christ what's been drawing us what's
[1:57:50] been converting us what's been changing
[1:57:52] us it's his own life he's coming to seek
[1:57:55] his own when Jesus came and and and and
[1:58:00] his coming in his body the the prophet
[1:58:03] from Nazareth he says I came to seek and
[1:58:05] to save that which was lost I came not
[1:58:08] to mind the world but I came to mind
[1:58:10] that were in the world what has he been
[1:58:13] seeking he's been seeking those names in
[1:58:15] that book amen why because that's
[1:58:19] himself
[1:58:21] amen he was looking for
[1:58:25] himself to bring his life into
[1:58:30] manifestation praise God
[1:58:35] Amen when when Philip asked
[1:58:39] him said Lord show us the
[1:58:44] father Jesus said have I been so long
[1:58:46] with you that you don't know me Phillip
[1:58:50] when you've seen me you've seen the
[1:58:54] father he says cuz it's not me that is
[1:58:58] doing the works it's the father in me
[1:59:02] he's doing the works
[1:59:04] amen listen friends we're supposed to be
[1:59:07] manifesting Christ on the earth so that
[1:59:11] when people see us they see Christ not
[1:59:13] this not the
[1:59:15] veil but the life behind the veil
[1:59:19] because it's not us that lives the word
[1:59:21] it's him in us that lives the word it's
[1:59:23] not us that's overcoming it's him in us
[1:59:26] that's overcoming it's not us displaying
[1:59:28] our own life it's him displaying his
[1:59:30] life through us it wasn't Paul it was
[1:59:35] Christ revealed in Paul it's not you and
[1:59:38] I it's that name that was on the book
[1:59:40] being made manifest today through this
[1:59:42] veil of
[1:59:43] Flesh and I can't I can't make the veil
[1:59:47] any more spectacular than it's ever
[1:59:49] been but it's the life Behind the Veil
[1:59:52] am listen when God would ever choose a
[1:59:55] veil God would use temporary products to
[1:59:59] hide eternal life yeah amen is that
[2:00:02] right God would take wool and RAM skins
[2:00:06] and porpus skins and Badger skins
[2:00:08] whatever it was and he would take these
[2:00:11] and listen as it sat out in the elements
[2:00:15] it began to
[2:00:16] weather that Tabernacle that was God's
[2:00:19] Dwelling Place it got old yeah right
[2:00:22] it got in
[2:00:24] disrepair it got
[2:00:26] shabby you say it sounds horrible to say
[2:00:29] that but God let it get shabby yeah he
[2:00:32] let the UV light begin to destroy it he
[2:00:35] let the elements begin to tear it he let
[2:00:37] it begin to fade over time he let it get
[2:00:39] weaker and he let it until till David
[2:00:42] pitched a new
[2:00:43] tent did he yes until Solomon come along
[2:00:48] and says now we're going to have to
[2:00:49] build a temple
[2:00:52] and then I always ask when David built
[2:00:55] his Tabernacle what happened to the
[2:00:57] Tabernacle Moses built where is it
[2:01:01] wouldn't you love to have a piece of the
[2:01:02] fabric off of it as a prayer
[2:01:04] cloth I'd want a piece of that Veil or
[2:01:07] the inner lining over where the
[2:01:09] cherubims are if I could get a little
[2:01:11] piece of that I would carry in my pocket
[2:01:13] every day of my life but where is it
[2:01:16] now why cuz it was just a veil the
[2:01:19] importance wasn't The Veil The
[2:01:21] Importance was the life behind the veil
[2:01:23] it would weather it would get old it it
[2:01:26] get tears in it it had to be repaired
[2:01:28] and stitched back together and then when
[2:01:29] it was too old to use they had to get
[2:01:31] another one and then when that one no no
[2:01:33] longer was suitable amen then they got
[2:01:35] another one yeah but what what did God
[2:01:38] let happen to Solomon's Temple God
[2:01:40] allowed Invaders God allowed Babylonians
[2:01:43] to come in and ransack it destroy it
[2:01:45] tear all the pieces apart and burn it
[2:01:47] with fire yeah right how could God do
[2:01:52] that because the importance was not the
[2:01:54] Tabernacle the importance was the life
[2:01:57] inside the Tabernacle and when the life
[2:01:59] left that Tabernacle he had no more use
[2:02:02] for the Tabernacle it wasn't the
[2:02:04] Tabernacle it was the life in the
[2:02:07] Tabernacle that's why we put so much
[2:02:09] importance on this flesh and certainly
[2:02:11] God won't let us get sick God won't let
[2:02:13] me weather God won't let me sit out
[2:02:15] under a UV light and get weak he won't
[2:02:17] let my garment get tattered he won't let
[2:02:19] me get old he won't let me die
[2:02:24] go read the
[2:02:26] Bible because it's not about the
[2:02:29] Tabernacle it's about the life
[2:02:33] inside this guy gets
[2:02:37] old gets weak can be torn in a
[2:02:43] storm amen but it doesn't change what's
[2:02:46] behind the
[2:02:47] veil it can need
[2:02:50] repaired it could get it could get in
[2:02:52] disorder through a storm and and it may
[2:02:55] need to be straightened out again the
[2:02:56] curtains may need to be straight and
[2:02:57] pulled back down and every that's life
[2:03:01] friends that's just
[2:03:03] life but it's not about the
[2:03:06] Veil The Veil is hiding the shikina
[2:03:09] glory of
[2:03:10] God we may have to fix the veil over and
[2:03:14] over and over
[2:03:16] again it may need renewed all the time
[2:03:19] it may need maintenance and I'm not just
[2:03:21] talking about getting old that happens
[2:03:23] too but things happen in life that rack
[2:03:27] the
[2:03:28] outside but it doesn't change who's on
[2:03:31] the throne amen it doesn't change that
[2:03:33] the light and the word have come
[2:03:35] together to manifest what's behind the
[2:03:39] veil I say oh God let your life remain
[2:03:43] behind my
[2:03:44] veil it's not the best Veil it's not the
[2:03:48] best wool it's not the best Ram skin
[2:03:50] it's not the best B your skin but it's
[2:03:53] the one he
[2:03:54] chose you can look at yourself and say I
[2:03:57] don't know why he chose me I hear people
[2:03:58] say that all the time I don't know why
[2:04:00] he chose me well I don't know
[2:04:02] either I mean I'm sure not I sure don't
[2:04:05] know why he chose you
[2:04:07] either like I'm scratching my head
[2:04:11] too but he decided which one would be
[2:04:14] part of this
[2:04:16] Tabernacle he's the one who picked up
[2:04:18] the stone and said that fits in my
[2:04:20] Tabernacle I'll start shaping it it yeah
[2:04:22] amen we didn't get to decide I don't
[2:04:25] know why he picked me sometimes we feel
[2:04:27] like an odd-shaped Stone why did he pick
[2:04:29] me cuz sometimes only an odd-shaped
[2:04:31] Stone will
[2:04:33] fit we got to quit worrying about those
[2:04:36] things those are the temporal things and
[2:04:38] they will fade away and God has a
[2:04:40] purpose in it all ups and downs and back
[2:04:42] and forth and storms and weathers and
[2:04:43] tears and rips and and and all kinds of
[2:04:46] things it'll come and go friends amen
[2:04:49] but what matters the most is the life
[2:04:52] that was in that Lamb's Book of Life
[2:04:54] yeah that name is in you
[2:04:57] amen and his life is come to Quicken
[2:05:00] that life into
[2:05:02] manifestation cuz brother brandham said
[2:05:05] that name that was written on the book
[2:05:06] is part of the word and you were on the
[2:05:10] Bible before the Bible came into
[2:05:16] print I've read this Bible through I
[2:05:19] don't know how many times I've never
[2:05:21] read Chad
[2:05:23] Lamb I read lamb a lot that always makes
[2:05:26] me feel
[2:05:28] good unless they're killing the
[2:05:33] lamb but yet I'm in
[2:05:37] here my name is in this
[2:05:41] Bible because my identity who I am is in
[2:05:45] this Bible and what I'm supposed to do
[2:05:48] in the end time is in this Bible so I
[2:05:51] and part of this word amen right and I
[2:05:56] didn't pick it he did when he wrote my
[2:05:58] name on the Lamb's Book of
[2:06:01] Life I'm so glad that I'm
[2:06:05] there and I'm so glad that he's
[2:06:08] here we couldn't do anything to produce
[2:06:10] anything in our lives it takes him
[2:06:13] coming the word found the word the word
[2:06:17] predestinated found the word for the day
[2:06:20] and the two came together and brought
[2:06:23] the manifestation of Christ out of our
[2:06:26] hearts and I say thank God the veil has
[2:06:31] been taken away from us and we become
[2:06:35] the veil that hides him from The World
[2:06:38] God bless you Saints let's all Stand
[2:06:46] Together musicians if you'll come
[2:06:49] brother Blake if you'll come
[2:06:56] just so many things on my heart
[2:06:59] friends these things there's nothing
[2:07:01] that we said today that was
[2:07:03] new but why is it it's always more
[2:07:06] exciting am because it's the reality
[2:07:11] it's the reality of the
[2:07:13] reality so much of life is
[2:07:16] just life carnal things that will fade
[2:07:19] away but there's a depth of reality
[2:07:22] that's inside of us and it's the most
[2:07:24] exciting thing in the world it's from
[2:07:26] out of this world when you realize that
[2:07:29] that that se gen it's in you that's part
[2:07:31] of the life of God that's part of the
[2:07:33] word that's part of Christ amen and when
[2:07:35] it was quick in life it was always there
[2:07:37] what is in you now is the same thing
[2:07:39] that's in the Lamb's Book of Life it's
[2:07:41] not like that name written there is
[2:07:43] something different than what you are
[2:07:44] here the real you on the inside behind
[2:07:47] the veil that you dwell in is whatever
[2:07:49] was written in that book yeah amen
[2:07:53] that's why when the lamb took the book
[2:07:54] it Thrills us yeah amen what makes us so
[2:07:58] excited even when brother brandom says
[2:07:59] and the lamb has to take the book and
[2:08:01] open the seils and we're all like yes
[2:08:03] amen what does it mean it's not that
[2:08:05] he's walking around with the book well I
[2:08:07] mean that's not the exciting part the
[2:08:08] exciting part is I don't know how I
[2:08:10] don't know how it come into me to know
[2:08:12] this but I know when the lamb takes the
[2:08:15] book it has something to do with me I
[2:08:17] don't know it here but when I hear
[2:08:19] brother brandham say it in the breach I
[2:08:21] know it down here when when the people
[2:08:23] are shouting I'm shouting when I look at
[2:08:26] John when John sees the lamb step
[2:08:28] forward when no man was worthy to take
[2:08:30] the book and he hears that the lion of
[2:08:31] the tribe of Judah has overcome and
[2:08:33] prevailed to take the book and he looks
[2:08:35] and he sees a bloody lamb and the Bloody
[2:08:37] lamb takes the book and when the bloody
[2:08:39] lamb takes the book and everybody falls
[2:08:41] down on their face and then John says
[2:08:43] and everything in heaven and everything
[2:08:45] on Earth and everything under the Earth
[2:08:47] heard I John shouting praises and glory
[2:08:50] and Hallelujah why because John knew
[2:08:53] he's in the book brother bam said he
[2:08:56] must have looked over and saw his name
[2:08:58] in the book how did he see his name in
[2:09:00] the book it was still sealed amen I
[2:09:02] don't know how he saw it with carnal
[2:09:04] natural eyes but something in John knew
[2:09:07] he was part of that book and if no man
[2:09:10] took the book all was lost amen what was
[2:09:14] John re re rejoicing about because by
[2:09:17] Revelation he knew he was part of that
[2:09:18] book what is so exciting about this
[2:09:20] message is by revelation we know we're
[2:09:23] part of the
[2:09:24] book part of the book is in me and the
[2:09:27] life of Christ is here living out that
[2:09:31] book it's the book of the life of the
[2:09:35] Lamb his life on display on the earth
[2:09:39] that's what's recorded in the book and
[2:09:40] I'm part of that book and the book is
[2:09:43] alive in me amen that's why this message
[2:09:46] is so
[2:09:47] exciting not because we imagine
[2:09:52] a a lamb with horns and eyes on the
[2:09:55] horns standing on its back little hoofs
[2:09:58] with a right those are
[2:10:04] symbols what we
[2:10:07] realize is I'm what's being redeemed
[2:10:10] amen that's right that I'm part of that
[2:10:12] original life that was fallen for God's
[2:10:16] manifestation but at the end of time he
[2:10:18] took the veil off what he's been trying
[2:10:20] to do all along and when when I saw what
[2:10:21] he was doing all along I said Glory
[2:10:23] hallelujah amen I'm part of the book and
[2:10:26] the lamb has took the book and we live
[2:10:28] in the day that the lamb has taken the
[2:10:30] book
[2:10:32] amen God what does that mean that he's
[2:10:35] now holding a
[2:10:37] book know what means he's claiming what
[2:10:40] he redeemed yeah what he did what did he
[2:10:43] redeem the names in the book what's the
[2:10:46] name in the book you yeah amen what book
[2:10:51] is he holding in his
[2:10:55] hand he came to claim his
[2:10:59] bride he's now holding
[2:11:03] me and he's come to unite with me Amen
[2:11:07] to manifest what was in this
[2:11:09] book Thank God Amen let's bow our heads
[2:11:13] and pray Lord Jesus we thank you God God
[2:11:17] we can't thank you enough for your word
[2:11:19] Lord God it does something to us Lord it
[2:11:22] stirs up something that's beyond
[2:11:24] comprehension Lord God I'm stirred
[2:11:26] Inside by something far beyond my
[2:11:28] intellect cuz I don't even understand
[2:11:30] the things I'm talking about but God by
[2:11:32] Revelation I know I'm part of it Lord
[2:11:35] when I hear that eagle scream there's a
[2:11:37] scream echoing inside of me that says
[2:11:41] amen when I see that eagle fly I know
[2:11:44] that there's something in me can fly I
[2:11:45] don't know how Lord but God help me to

[2:12:16] attractions of
[2:12:18] Life help us to push aside those things
[2:12:21] that don't matter Lord so that we might
[2:12:24] Lord focus on the thing that's most
[2:12:27] needful that we might be a vessel that
