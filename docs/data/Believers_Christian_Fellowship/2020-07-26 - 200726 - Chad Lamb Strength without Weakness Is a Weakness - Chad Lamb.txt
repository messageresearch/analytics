you sister tanya godfrey it's good to have you in church today amen praise be to god for what he's done amen we're so happy to see you here and see your smiling eyes [Laughter] praise be to god god is certainly good to us friends amen before we read the scripture i got another announcement to make uh brother dean hatfield got a call from the lake placid christian conference center we're gonna have our camp in october and they've canceled the the camp and they've closed down the campground for the rest of the year which will be terminating our camp our october so it's disappointing but i guess not surprising and so we'll just uh take it as from the lord and look to the following year and see if we're here and what we want to do then so just be praying for us that we can make some decisions like some dates open in 2021 we could reserve or let it go for now and so the trustees are discussing uh i and the trustees are discussing what we ought to do but just give us uh just pray that god will give us wisdom amen but so you know i know many of you have taken some vacation time and set aside time and money and things for that so i want to let you know as soon as we were able to that they canceled that so praise the lord anyhow god has good things in store for his bride let's look at the second corinthians chapter 12 together second corinthians chapter 12 and verse 9. and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word for god it is our guiding light is the only thing we have to go by in this dark world no we know we can't trust our own thinking we can't trust our own reasoning we can't trust the news we can't trust governments we can't we can't trust any other voice lord but the voice of your word we thank you for this word and that lord you've come in yourself in this generation and spoke it to us so clearly so that we would know it lord and that we could live by it we pray god that you would take preeminence among us this morning lord that you would move everything out of the way that would hinder you would bind every wrong spirit that would try to hinder and that your holy ghost can move freely lord through this place that you can take your word and mold character in your children that we can become more like you word by word in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all have your seats i want to just continue moving forward with the thoughts the the way the lord's leading and the title today is an unusual title but it's strength without weakness is a weakness so you might want to write that down let that soak in strength without weakness is a weakness praise be to god let's run to first corinthians chapter one first corinthians chapter one verse 25 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and the things which are despised have god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence so it's amazing when we read this scripture we know these things to be true but but in our own human pride we have such a hard time being something that's despised to be to be something that's weak something that's not noble that's not strong that's base you know we in in human we're talking the human side of us we don't want to be known as weak we don't want to be known as base despised rejected nothing we all want to be somebody we want to be something but god chose not the somebodies or the some things to confound the wisdom of the wise but god has chosen the things that are not to bring the not the things that are and so then now all of a sudden it's like everything in our human understanding flips upside down and so now it's not that i want to be the man i want to be nobody it's not that i want to be respected or well thought of that's a dangerous place to be i would rather be the one who's rejected and downcast and nobody and not without wisdom without understanding without finances without resources without any way to help myself because if i can be in that place amen then then everything is on god and god can take nothing amen and do something with nothing that's what he chooses to do and so so many times in our lives you know we've always strived for this next level of whatever we're chasing after and that's just the human side no next level of finances next level in job next level and this and that and and we don't realize that sometimes amen those next levels of accomplishment put us in another level of danger and and we feel that it's security or or uh a greater more secure position but sometimes that greater more secure position in the flesh amen brings a weakness to us that will cause us to stumble into fall and so god is good to his children he's good to us that he keeps us he keeps us endowed with troubles he keeps us showered with tribulations he keeps us in this place where you know i don't know how it's been for you but for me all of my life every time i'd get a little bit of money something would happen something would break the car would engine would lock up the the appliances would go bad and something would happen and that little bit of money i had would disappear it would take wings like an eagle and fly away and then i would be so disheartened and so upset and so sad you know what what has happened but now i look back on my life and i realized that was god's grace and mercy to me that he would keep me in a place of dependency and and i don't know why it was it's always so hard in a trial that when i'd finally get a little bit of money tucked away and saved up and then something would happen and for me it would seem like it was often car trouble you know something would happen with the car and then you would drain out all of that and instead of rejoicing that i had the cash instead of rejoicing at god's provision ahead of time instead of being excited and seeing the hand of god and making sure i had what i needed to meet the challenge that was coming i would feel dejected and cast down and i would feel despondent because i just lost all my money because money to me was equaling security but our security is in christ and so god for me knew that i couldn't handle that at that time in my life i couldn't handle that kind of false security so he would never let me have the false security so that i would always rely on the true security that's why so often you see people who struggle all through life and god will shower blessings upon them later in their life amen and they'll have resources but it was because of the trials and the tribulations and they learned not to trust the resources that god could give them resources but if your heart is bent on trusting resources god if you're a child of god he'll not let you have too many because he loves us and then the devil will come and whisper in our ear at the love of god amen and we'll turn it into something other than the love of god will turn it into you know god must not like me why does this always happen to me why me and but it's the love of god friends it's god's mercy to us if we could turn to second samuel i want to take a look uh through a few scriptures at the life of david and the sons and we know that these things were written for our examples these things that happened or for us so that we might learn how to live and they're written for this day but i want to look at second samuel chapter 3 verse 2. ii samuel chapter 3 verse 2. and unto david were sons born in hebron and the firstborn was abnon of a high no no you know what this is not fun i know i'm so glad brother branham had to have his girlfriend read his scriptures when he started in the ministry amen makes me feel good when i have to read a heinous the jezreelites in his second chiliad of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of macau the daughter of taumayi king of gesher and the fourth adonijah the son of hageth and the fifth shafatiya the son of abbatol and the sixth by ingla david's wife these were born to david in hebron so he starts speaking of these first six sons and when you look at the first six sons that were born to him in hebron there's one that stands out i mean there's a few that stand out for different reasons but there's one here that stands out to me for the purpose that i want to use today and it's in verse three and it says in the third absalom the son of maraka the daughter of taumay king of gesher and so you find out that absalom comes from good stock absalom's mother is a daughter to the king of gesher and gesher was a strong kingdom on the north side of israel and at this time there was some relations between israel and and gesher but this is the king of gesher and the king of gesher's daughter is married to david who's king of israel so you have an alliance of two strong kingdoms and in the alliance of two strong kingdoms they produce absalom so in in the birth and the birth of these first six sons this is the first one that comes from royal stock like they all come from david we know that's real stock but on the mother side is the first one we have mentioned that comes from royal stock and so already absalom if you if you just look at the way he's born and who he comes from in his in his lineage absalom already is in an exalted position in his birth and we know the story of absalom that's not a good thing let's turn over to verse 14. verse 14 or chapter 14. i'm sorry second samuel chapter 14. ii samuel 14 and 25 but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom uh-oh uh-oh see when we're born in this fallen condition with the human nature that's what we want to have said about us right and our fallen nature when we're born and not i'm not talking about an evil wicked nature that wants to murder and i'm just talking natural your natural birth the way you're born when you're born you want somebody to say this about you that's what we want i i mean it's a good thing right but for absalom it's a bad thing verse 25 but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty from the soul of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him i love the way the bible is written i love i love the way god makes it so distinctly clear amen what the problem is the problem with absalom is his perfection the problem with lucifer was his perfection his wisdom his beauty amen his revelation his brightness and he was corrupted by his brightness by his understanding and knowledge of god he was corrupted he was full of wisdom perfect in beauty and he was corrupted by those very gifts amen gifts can cause a man's pride to come to the surface like nothing else can gifts can cause a man's pride to come to service and can lead to self-exaltation above the most high god and you say no i'm not seeing that above listen you say this is self-exaltation above the most high god but i want to remind you god is his word so the moment a moment a human being becomes exalted above the word he has exalted him above the most high god and now he has taken the same nature as lucifer because lucifer said i will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven i will be like the most high god and so the minute that that that a human being can exalt his own will his own desire above the word of god he is exalting himself above the most high god and you would never get the man to say that out of his lips he would never say that but that's exactly what's happening and so absalom was born in a danger zone i say absalom was born i mean the whole kingdom should have bowed down and prayed for him because he was set up for disaster from the soul of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him this is what every woman that's ever been born once perfect in beauty not a blemish from the soul of his foot through the crown of his head not one blemish and you know when when those girls start moving into those teenage years that natural desire to be pretty which is not wickedness in itself but a natural desire to be pretty all of a sudden if somebody would say that about you when you hit 14 15 16 you'd be like oh praise the lord not knowing that that could be the very thing that brings your destruction it'd be better to be born with a giant birthmark right in the center of your face than to have things too perfect and this is i mean this is not labor to see in preaching friends but it's the truth and now we understand our lives if we understand these things out of the scriptures and the way the way it works and the way it's always worked now we understand why god allows things to happen and why god keeps us and he keeps knocking us down and when we begin to prop something up god will knock our props out and sometimes it seems like the very god of heaven is against us i mean we know he's not we would never say he was but sometimes like everything i try fails and every time i try this it fails every time i go this direction it fails and i would say i would say you're only partially right amen the god of heaven is against your plan for self-security and self-exaltation but he's very much for you he may be against your pride but he's for you so so let's keep reading so from the soul of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him and when he pulled his head for it was at every year's end that he pulled it because the hair was heavy on him there he pulled it he weighed the hair of his head at a 200 shekels after the king's weight praise the lord he had a big mop of hair and it was beautiful and he was beautiful and he was perfect amen and when we read this now we can we can read this and you can say who wants to be lucifer nobody puts their hands up who wants to be absalom nobody puts their hands up but the but but what was the description of lucifer perfection what was the description of absalom perfection but who did god choose to carry forth his program amen he would choose the imperfect he would choose to cast away he would use the nobodies he would use the ones with a tainted path with a tainted reputation with a question mark around their life because that is the one that god can take amen because they've already been a base they've borne a base they're born rejected and he can exalt them amen and if anybody god wanted to use was already in an exalted position like moses and like paul god knew how to break them out of that and bring them to nothing amen so that he could begin to use them for his kingdom work and that is the grace of god amen let's look at chapter 15 verse 1 now and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him chariots and horses and 50 men to run before him and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what city art thou and he said i servant as of one of the tribes of israel and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed deputed of the king to hear thee absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i would do him justice and it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obscenes he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him and on the manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel absalom i'll say this way absalom was no dummy he was wise absalom was crafty he was subtle he was beautiful he he had everything going for him and in fact you know absalom also conspired to have his brother killed because his brother had raped his sister and absalom's full sister and he hated him and he had him killed and he was exiled and he left the kingdom but when he was exiled and left the kingdom he went to gesher to his grandfather's kingdom and was in gesher as a grandson of the king so i want to ask you what was that what was that exile like was it the back side of the desert where god molds character into men when he was exiled and put out from david he went to another strong kingdom and to the house of another strong king and he was there treated as royalty in the house of another strong king see there was nothing that would bring character to absalom even in his exile amen there was no punishment even in his exile i mean there was no abasing amen in his exile maybe maybe this is just me but maybe in his exile some of those lessons that he had learned about his perfection and his wisdom were reinforced not tore down maybe in gesher you know now all of a sudden he he he himself absalom is the one who can bridge these two mighty kingdoms he has a foot in each stronghold i should say putting him in a stronger position than all the other king's sons because he's got an ally to the north he's blood relation to the king so who knows what was going through his mind but you can see that the exile didn't change absalom in in his self-exaltation and his uh reflection of himself and his thoughts of himself so then through septility he begins to win the hearts of the people by just being overly kind to them and and showing love and affection and in wisdom he was stealing the hearts the scriptures as he was stealing the hearts of all of israel let's go to ii samuel 18. i'm just pulling little points we know there's a there's a long story here but i don't want to read through the whole story i just want to pull points out and then ii samuel 18 verse 18 i'd like to read now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the king's dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called into this day absalom's place praise god he's exposing his own nature he he he reared up a pillar unto himself and called it by his own name i said god that's dangerous dangerous that he thought himself worthy to have a monument erected after his name the fact that he thought that was a good idea is dangerous the fact that he thought that that was a good thing to do showed where his mind was and showed that he was absolutely in danger of destruction and we know he got his destruction his destruction came he tried to overthrow his father's kingdom and it's amazing how is as much as absalon had going for him as much as he had the love and affection of the people he had beauty he had perfection he had power and two kingdoms he had all of these things but it's amazing he was never satisfied with the portion that he had and where was absalom lacking where was absalom's need where where was he where was he in need for more i mean he had everything that he needed or wanted amen but it's never enough amen that self-exaltation is never satisfied enough and so absalom erected for himself a pillar he needed the notoriety he he needed the accomplishment he needed he felt himself worthy to have a monument erected after him and i say that's a disgrace first corinthians 10 12 says wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall it's better to be flat on your face knowing that you can't stand it's better to know that you're not able you're not capable you you can't do it than to think i'm standing you know it's better to say without god there's no way i could stand now i want to we've looked at absalom now i want to look at solomon let's look at second samuel chapter 12. we'll go back a couple chapters here to chapter 12. and we know how samuel came about samuel was the product of david and bathsheba and we know that bathsheba was another man's wife bathsheba was the wife of uriah the hittite so she was the wife of a gentile a hittite and a hittat's wife and now now david when he's when when there's when we come to the season where kings go out to battle david was so secure in his kingdom and not in danger that he didn't have to go himself to fight the battles he had other people that he could send himself and so now you begin to see the danger of security and in his security he walking at the house top and begins to see bathsheba and he's tempted by her amen and because he's not out defending the kingdom because he has no immediate threat you realize that if if david had an immediate threat if there was somebody besieging the the the walls of jerusalem he would have never fell with bathsheba if he would have had a mighty kingdom that was in resurrect insurrection against his rule amen and threatening to come and fight him on his own land david would have went to battle amen but but god had got david into such a place under such blessings amen that david could relax back and it was in the relaxing back that david fell and so when you find yourself with demon powers beating on your walls and hurling stones over your wall every day of your life you can say thank you lord jesus for that that is your mercy and grace to me then i'm not going to relax back but i'm going to stay in the fight and i'm going to stay on guard and i'm going to stay vigilant and watchful because i've i've hardly been free from a battle my whole christian life and you say why why is it you know i used to live under the realm of self-deception that when i get through this it'll be better now as soon as i get through this it'll smooth out and be better once this is over amen everything will start to get better and then you realize it's not getting better that issue gets better and something else goes sour amen something else happens there's another problem there's another trouble amen there's things that you caused you've done things that you've not caused or not done but still affect you and and you begin to realize after a while these are good things we thought we can get the wrong notion that to be the bride of jesus christ means that god will treat me like absalom you understand but god might treat you like david david had struggles and troubles all the way through we think to be a child of god means that god will pick us up and set us on a pedestal and and and no troubles will come and there'll be no complications in life and i'll never have to deal with an issue and if anything comes against me lightning bolts from heaven will come down and strike it because i'm a child of god and we get the complete wrong understanding of what god is trying to do in his grace and mercy in our lives to keep us in trouble to keep us in the fight to keep us dependent and needy and watchful every hour of the day and and so we get the wrong notions and then sometimes we think when when so much trouble happens that why is this happening to me i'm a child of god and i'd say it's happening to you because you're a child of god because when god opened the book in this hour when he opened the word amen he unlocked a power and authority that i don't we haven't even fully realized yet he has taken the the title deed book of redemption amen and he has and he is he's taken the book and he's passed it down to his seventh church age messenger seven church age messengers turned and given it to the church now we have taken and eaten this book and what is this book it's the title deed of all of redemption everything that adam lost has been restored back to mankind amen and even if we haven't fully realized the full benefit of that and fully express and manifest the full benefit of it the truth is it's in the bride and how can god put that kind of power inside human flesh amen and let the human flesh live in such a realm of perfection that that power will go rogue on him say god thank you for what you've done for me i've never went without and i've never had too much and that's a good thing you see sometimes you know i use the financial example but you'll see sometimes somebody's blessed with finances and their health is an absolute wreck and they would trade their finances for health and you have some people that would change their health for finances those are the people who are really messed up you see god always has something to keep his children in check you see somebody with blessings on one hand but their family is a wreck they have a child that is just hurting them so bad and causing such pain and grief houses paid for enough finances for everything health is good but i've got this heartbreaking situation in my life that keeps me on my face before going see none of the children of god are free from this and it's his love and mercy to us if we could just see it that way it would change our attitude it would change the way we perceive the world around us if we could just see what god's doing so david in a relaxed state when when he come to a certain security in his kingdom he was set up to fail and he fell of his own accord he fell of his own lust he took bathsheba unto himself and had uriah the hittite killed and so this is this is this this becomes a public disaster and nathan the prophet comes and and he and he explains the situation and and david repents but but from that union comes a child and that child is cursed by god and that child dies and then you know once uriah is dead god takes beth or david takes bathsheba to himself and he marries bathsheba and after the first child dies amen now the the second child or the first child of their marriage union after they're married comes solomon now if you just contrast solomon with absalom how did absalom come into this world he come in this world destined to be a powerful king solomon comes into this world through a tainted story that's not pleasant to read that's not pleasant to talk about that isn't you know isn't the greatest accomplishment in david's life and through this disaster through this horrible family situation through the through the trouble it caused the kingdom through the shame that it and reproach it brought against david through all of that comes solomon and we pick it up in second samuel 12 and 24 at the birth of solomon and it says and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went under her and lay with her and she bear a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him and he went by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his name jedediah because of the lord and jedediah means beloved of jehovah and you think to yourself how could god love this this was never said about absalom david loved absalom and david's heart cried for absalom after he died but we never have god say this about absalom but we have god himself say this about solomon that he loved him amen and had nathan the prophet named him jedediah means beloved of jehovah amen god loved him amen because god has chosen the base things the things that are not amen to bring them not the things that are amen for for whatever reason amen this is what god wanted to use when he was going to display amen the kingdom of christ and the reign of solomon the millennial reign the golden age he had amen to take that vessel and start him has nothing amen with a coming through a bad union amen that came a bad way amen and he had to bring solomon up through that so that he could have a vessel that he could use because that ministry was going to be the type of jesus christ in the millennium see god doesn't doesn't work everything through perfection amen because that's detrimental to us as human beings but god will bring down the lowly and if it's high he'll bring it low so that he can bring it back up to something he can use and then you realize the whole thing this whole thing is for god to have vessels he can use it's not about my money it's not about my health it's not about my family it's not about my church it's not about my happiness not about my pleasure not about what i accomplish in this life amen really when it comes down to it when you get down to the nuts and bolts it's all about god having a tabernacle and flesh that he can express his word through that he can move his program that he can display himself that he can tell his story that he can act out his drama and then you then you begin to look at your life differently god just wants a vessel that's all he wants he just wants a vessel a vessel that he can use a vessel where he'll get the glory let's turn to first kings first kings chapter 3. when god was going to fulfill the prophecy of isaiah and come through a virgin he did it in such a way that that he would choose a virgin from a base city in israel from nazareth not from jerusalem from nazareth and he would do it in such a way it would be stunts in private with gabriel privately visiting her that god god would would send uh to the uh officials to the priest to the the rabbis and to the religious leaders and political leaders god would not send them the confirmation that her story is true not in a way they could accept he sent it to the wise men but they didn't accept that and he sent it through shepherds but they didn't accept that either but god would choose this little virgin girl from nazareth and and he would tell her something privately and nobody else heard the conversation there were no witnesses to that conversation and he would bring it through a reputation and through gossip and through a lie that said that she had been unfaithful to her promise to her husband and that she was impregnated while she was betrothed to another and god wouldn't stop the lie and god amen would not prove it wrong to defend mary in her telling of the story because god wanted it this way because he comes through humility he comes through the low he comes to the base he comes through the knot the nothings and that's how god works first kings three and five solomon has now become king and now in in first kings chapter three verse five he says in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee and solomon said thou has shown unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in in an uprightness of heart with thee and thou has kept for him the great kindness that thou has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day i want you to look at the humility in solomon's words solomon didn't see in himself any merit for the throne how do you think absalom what would his conversation be like to god but solomon says this day you have showed great kindness and mercy to my father and keeping your promise to him that he would have a son on the throne it wasn't solomon's merits it wasn't solomon's effort it wasn't his birth it wasn't the power in his lineage amen amen solomon had nothing amen to boast about about this position that god had put him but he recognized it had nothing to do with him it had everything to do with a promise that god promised to david and god was using him to keep his word amen if god has called you as the bride of jesus christ he's doing it to keep his word amen he goes on to say verse 7 and now o lord my god thou has made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child and i know not how to go out or come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people oh this is what god wants friends this is exactly why he loves solomon this is exactly why solomon was born the way he was born this is why solomon was put into this position because of this attitude right here this is the attitude god wants amen solomon saw the people as greater than himself amen he wasn't exalted above the people because he was the greatest among the people that was absalom absalom i don't know what the conversation would have been like but god come to absalom amen absalom would have said hey god you made a good choice this is just me there's no bible for this i mean there's examples but you made a good choice you did a good job thank you i got it from here what would you like um a little more of what you've already done would be sufficient a little more money a little more prestige a little more honor but solomon's attitude is totally different he says i'm but a little child i'm but a little child and i don't know how to go out or to come in before so great a people i don't know how to act like a king i don't know how to be a king i i don't know how to judge rightly i don't know how to take care this is so great of people god i'm going to mess this up if you don't help me god you've called me to be a king and a priest but i feel like a little child you've said that i am now a king and a priest that's what your word says i believe it you have taken me from the miry clay you have taken the lowly you've taken the base you've taken the nothing and you have lifted me up far above what i deserve lord and you have called me your bride and you've called me your child but god i'm such a little town and i don't even know how to talk i don't know how to be a king and a priest god you've called me bride but i don't know how to be a bride can we say that can we be honest and say i don't even know i the world is so crazy and changing moment by moment that i have nothing figured out anymore i don't even know how to be a bride in this next situation i don't know how to be a bride when things change i don't know how to be a king and priest in this situation i don't i know what you said and i believe it and i know who i am because you've called me amen but i don't know i don't know how to do this lord i don't know what you want in this hour i don't know what you want to come out of my mouth i don't know how to think right how to talk right how to be right i need something from you i think if we could pray like that that's exactly what he wants and that's why he's chosen us who doesn't know anything that's why he's chosen amen that's why he's chosen the things that are not the things that are average or below average amen and now all of a sudden the the fact that we're nothing has become better has become reassuring has become comforting solomon had the right attitude verse 8 again and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great of people and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing and god said unto him because thou has asked this thing thou has not asked for thyself long life neither has thou asked riches for thyself nor has asked thy the life of thine enemies but has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that thou was so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee and i've also given thee that which thou has not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all the days of my life all the days of thy life see if you want if if you want the blessings of god to remain in your life then don't ask for the blessings of god ask for an understanding heart that i can conduct myself the way i should and the position you've put me in that you've raised me up you've pulled me up out of the earth you've dusted me off you've washed me in sanctification amen you've cleansed me by your blood you've filled me with your spirit you've called me a king and a priest you've called me a bride but god i need an understanding heart how to act in this position you've put me in you know it's dangerous it's dangerous when we begin to think that god did a good job when he picked me because i've got the tools that he needs that i can see why he picked me for this i can see that because i've got this and i've got that when we become when we begin to feel in our flesh and our human side worthy are capable of the calling i think that's the time to go back down to our knees and say god i'm just a child i'm just a human being i'm just in human flesh like all other human flesh this dirt is no better wiser capable than any other pile of dirt but yet god you've put something on the inside that you're calling to come forth in this life you're calling for your queen to rise on the scene and unite with you you're calling for for see this day is calling for a display of jesus christ in the formation of his bride that's what this hour is calling for it is calling amen for the rising of the bride to her position not because she's special not because she's able but because that's what the word says the word calls for jesus christ to be in the formation of his bride in this hour that we're living and in order to do that he has got to take lumps of clay that he has dropped attributes of himself in and he has got to call them back by the calling of his word and he has got to wash them with the water of his word and he has got to fill them with his own life to quicken that seed on the inside and he's got to lift that bride up into a position where he can display himself through that bride but that's what he's doing that's his work and that's his purpose and that's for his glory and on the human side we've got to recognize that this is an impossibility if he doesn't give me something if he doesn't do something for me there is absolutely no way the only thing i can do is mess this up the only thing that i can do is ruin what the good thing god wants to do if i'm left to myself god i need something i need something for you i'm but a child i'm but a human i'm just incapable as incapable can be god i need you to give me a heart of understanding i need you to give me wisdom from your word i need you to give me your spirit amen to pull out everything that you've put inside because me as a human being i don't know what to do next and most decisions that i've made have been wrong oh if we could just be honest we could just be honest see let's look at first samuel i want to look at david we're going to find out as solomon starts off here he has the nature of his father but you realize absalom didn't have the nature of david absalom had a different nature and absalom's mother i don't remember how to pronounce her name but her name means oppression amen so absalom was a product of the oppressive church but david was a product of the shamed humble wife of a gentile and they expressed two different natures but solomon was able to express the nature of his father david let's look at first samuel 24 and 4. this is after david has been anointed by samuel to be king over israel the anointing always been poured over him he has showed up and killed goliath he has been a mighty man in the army of saul and served the king but now saul's heart is turned against him and he's chasing him he's chasing him from cave to cave from wilderness spot to wilderness spot and now they find themselves in a cave together david and saul and saul lays down to sleep we pick it up in verse 4 it says in the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then david arose and cut off the skirt of saul saul's robe privately and it came to pass afterward that david's heart smote him because he had cut off saul's skirt you realize his friends were telling him to kill saul you should kill him you this is your chance god and listen god has delivered him into your hand david is in the cave hiding amen saul's chasing after them david's in there with some of his mighty men and and and saul comes in and lays down the sleep at his feet basically and his men says get him get him now this is your time amen obviously god has brought him to your feet see how see how diabolical human reasoning is because it sounds so good i mean of all the caves he could have went into he come into this one it's god it's got to be god and i say it is god it absolutely is god but not for the destruction of saul but for the perfection of david but the human reasoning amen will now take the human will and human desire and take the circumstances and evoke the human will into god's will and through reasoning make human desire god's will and david compromised he didn't kill saul but he just went over there to teach him a lesson to prove a point he took out his sword and he cut part of his skirt off to shame him to prove something to make a point took part of his skirt off and after he had done it his heart smote him how many of us in the same situation would be proud at the at the perfection of our character not killing him you see the reality here friends we'd have walked out of there yeah god delivered him into my hands and they were trying to get me to kill him but i knew that would be wrong so all i did was just prove a point and shame him a little bit bible's so beautiful friends it just takes and unravels us layer by layer until you're just exposed before god so so david verse 5 and it came to pass afterward that david's heart smote him because he had cut off saul's skirt and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lord's anointed to stretch forth my hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord this saul anointed to the lord was wicked it was doing wicked deeds for no reason he was trying to murder david he had thrown a javelin at him he got so angry at throwing a javelin at his own son jonathan for defending david he was chasing david and david was also god's anointed right and so you have one anointed of the lord chasing another anointed of the lord and and he's and he's running him down and he's breathing threats against him and and and david is and david is trying to stay out of trouble fleeing running away not fighting back amen and then saul winds up right at his feet and all of his friends are saying get him get him get him get him get him it's the lord it's the lord it's the lord and it looked like it could be the lord and david does this little thing that that seemingly wasn't anything didn't really harm him didn't really hurt him never really touched him just a small thing but as soon as he did it his heart smote him and he told his friends i i shouldn't have done that because that's the lord's anointing see once god had sent a prophet to pour the anointing on samuel or in saul saul was god's anointed and david listen i i hope we can catch this david wasn't respecting saul david was respecting god saul wasn't worthy in himself of respect saul didn't deserve if saul got what he deserved he should have got a knife to the throat but david david's oh david's heart smote him not because of his love for saul or his reverence for saul's character but his reverence for god if god anointed that vessel i'm not touching that vessel no matter how bad that vessel is god anointed that vessel now let's take it down to god's anointed people god has anointed his bride in this day and it doesn't matter amen what what somebody else is doing how you could say it's wrong and they shouldn't do that they shouldn't say those things amen but we've got to have enough respect for god not to touch god's anointed if that's a child of god children of god can do wrong children of god can do wicked and be evil die not be evil but do evil you understand children of god can do evil deeds children of god can do wrong amen anointed of god can persecute other anointed of god it can happen and they can still be children of god and god will let it happen to perfect us and say i will not touch god's anointed we read wednesday michael when he was disputing with the devil over moses's body he did not bring a railing accusation he said the lord rebuke you the lord deal with you i'm not i'm just doing what i'm told to do the lord will deal with you why can't we do that for each other this was the devil not even a brother it was a devil see david one thing about david that was david's david's mark of david's character is david loved the lord and wanted to please the lord let's look at second samuel chapter 12 again back to second samuel 12. this is after david's evil deed and having uriah kill committing adultery with bathsheba nathan the prophet comes to him and speaks to him second samuel 12 and 9. he says wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight thou has killed uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from nine house because thou has despised me let's go back up and read verse nine again a slow down wherefore has thou despised the commandment of the lord what was the commandment of the lord thou shalt not commit adultery one of the ten commandments first you despise the commandment of the lord but then god says he has despised me see david in his own willful desire and his own lust took another man's wife and killed that man but it wasn't that he despised the man god didn't see david despising that man he saw david despising him so if we want god's view on our sin this is it right here on our willfulness and on our sin now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou has despised me and has taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife verse 13 and david said unto nathan i have sinned against uriah bathsheba the people my family i have sinned against the lord see this brings gravity to the situation when we do wrong we fail to keep the word of the lord we haven't just hurt whoever was hurt but we have despised when when when david failed to keep the commandment god said you despised my commandments when then he says when you despise my commandment you despised me and david had enough sense to say i sinned against the lord what i did in not keeping his commandment i sinned against the lord i i am sorry that it was against the lord that i had sinned see david was a man after god's own heart and david honored and respected and loved the lord he didn't just love his position david was a king but he was a king who was able to repent he was a king who was able to say he was wrong he was a king he was able to stand in the gap he was a king who was able to weep do you realize david was the great leader and king of mighty men i can imagine if i could dramatize david is anointed to be king anointed by samuel the prophet you'll be a king and under the revelation that anointing he goes and with great faith he kills goliath he fights many a battles until the people would sing saul has killed us thousands but david has killed his ten thousand a mighty warrior mighty leader mighty king mighty anointed of god amen to be amen to to bring the kingdom into a place where god wants it to come mighty things were happening amen can you imagine he's he's running from he's running from uh a saul and saul's chasing him and and he's running like a scared rabbit from place to place to place not because he can't destroy saul not because he's not a mighty word not because he can't i mean i believe david could have went toe-to-toe with saul and destroyed saul it wasn't fear of saul that had him running from cave to cave it was fear it was fear of god that had him running from cave to cave to cave he didn't want the confrontation with saul he didn't want the fight he did not want it to come to a battle on the battlefield because he did not want to touch the lord's anointed so he would run away so that there was never a battle i wonder how many times we show up how many times do we show up to a place hoping somebody will just say the right thing we show up ready for the fight we show up looking for the fight we show up to prove a point to make a point there but david because he loved the lord and he respected what the lord had done was running from cave to cave to cave not because he was afraid of saul not because he didn't know who he was because he wasn't going to have that confrontation with saul saul was god's responsibility god had anointed him god had placed him as king god was in charge david it wasn't david's job david had respect to god and respect to his word and he was a man after god's own heart and i tell you friends that's the way i want to live i'm ashamed of myself for showing up wanting the fight i've done it i've showed up hoping the conversation would go this way because i had all my bullets loaded click all my quotes click i had them in a speed file i could pull them up on my phone i had the places marked in my bible click click you see banaya the gentile warrior who had went into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion the other one who who had killed 300 standing in a field of lentils filled 300 philistines and wouldn't give up the lentil field these are mighty men mighty warriors they come into the cave one day following a mighty leader an anointed of the lord amen following the one who's going to be king amen the mighty man where's david oh he's back in the back playing the harp crying again he's been crying for three days you walk over and you see david the killer of goliath the mighty mighty warrior the anointed of the lord and he doesn't know what god wants him to do and he's strumming on a harp crying writing poems singing to the lord lord rescue me in my affliction lord lift me out of the miry pit lord what would you think if you had just went to a snowy pit a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion and your great leaders over there strumming a harp crying for day after day after day that's what god liked god liked having a man who was weak who was needy who was humble who would weep before the lord and say lord i i need you to rescue me i can't rescue myself i need you to deliver me lord everybody's against me they're all coming after me lord i'm looking to you to deliver me god to cry and to say i have no answer i don't know what to do next i don't know i don't know where we're going from here can you imagine the 400 warriors that have gathered to david saying david what are we doing next i don't know what we're doing next lord hasn't told me yet brothers let's sing a song [Laughter] my strength is made perfect in weakness the way up is down i mean god has a different desire than ours let's go to philemon chapter one when i was a little boy i wanted to be david giants falling people singing songs to you i never thought about david hiding in a cave weeping before the lord crying day after day because he didn't know why his life was in the mess he didn't know why these things were happening he didn't know why saul hated him so bad and he didn't know why he was so afflicted i didn't see that part i didn't see the part where god loved him so much that he got away with nothing every move he made brought a heavy rod of correction upon david that wasn't the part i was looking at when i was a little boy i just was looking at the shepherd boy who shocked them all right showed up to the show and took over but i didn't realize what it took to have that success to have that victory that wasn't david who killed goliath that was god who killed goliath he just used david that wasn't david who killed his ten thousand that was god who killed the ten thousand but he was using david because he had a vessel that he could use and you know why they could sing the accolades of david above the accolades of saul because saul was working for saul but david was working for god and when god got a man in his hand under his control he could do more with that man amen than saul could do with his whole army saul was fighting for his notoriety saul was fighting to hear the ladies sing the song david wasn't fighting for the song david was fighting for the word saul was fighting to hold on to what god had given him amen david had nothing to hold on to he was fighting for god and that's why god could do more with david than he can do with saul i said god make us humble make us more like david philemon i said philemon right chapter 1 verse 1. paul a prisoner of jesus christ paul was not a prisoner of rome paul was in a roman prison under roman care but he wasn't a prisoner of rome paul was a prisoner of jesus christ brother brahm says in the message christ the mystery of god revealed another one the night if you don't get it on tape i preached here one night on a prisoner of jesus christ paul a prisoner when god gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing but what the spirit says do paul with all of his great intellects he was taught by gamaliel to be a great priest or rabbi someday and he had high ambitions he was intellectual great man great authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it seed to become part of the word to express jesus christ so god took paul who had it all figured out and then paul lost it all and went to the backside of the desert to relearn unlearn everything that he had learned so that he could call it dung so god could give him the correct revelation and paul now come out of that experience a prisoner of jesus christ brother abraham says in the message the comforter now we have a sacred trust you know what a trust is and we have an inheritance a heritage that we inherit as believing children it's a sacred trust and that that sacred trust and our sacred heritage is the word of god that's been given to us the full word of god the word itself is the vitamin the word itself god's word that's where reason that's the reason i'm so dogmatic as i would call it on standing on this word no matter what anything else says if it's not with the word then i don't believe it if you don't believe it it's all right but to me it takes the word because heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail therefore it takes the word i live by the word jesus said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and this is it and that is given to us as a heritage it's our inheritance the word oh god let us think of it in deepness of it it's our privilege it's this sacred trust that god has put to his church god gave his word to his church and that sacred heritage is ours it's a gift from god not to just compromise on this and cut this out and throw this out and add this in to suit our own taste but to preach the full word the whole gospel we are duty bound as christians to take it and believe it when we know if our hearts condemn us not then we know we have favor with god the reason i i wanted to read that i want to bring it to this point david honored the word of god saul honored his own will saul saul was able when when the commandment of god didn't fit his personal desire saul was always willing to take his own idea over what samuel the prophet had said and saul was sure anointed of god and god called him to be king and god placed him in a position of power and authority and was it was building in him a great kingdom amen but he got so exalted in himself that he thought that what samuel said was a suggestion or at least he treated it as such because when samuel said i'll come to you this day and wait till i get there and sacrifice to the lord and when samuel delayed his coming amen saul took it upon himself to begin offering sacrifices and he did this another time when he when he told saul you know samuel said the lord has sent thee to go after the sinners the amalekites kill everything they have save nothing amen and samuel shows up and he says you know saul comes out and says i did what you said to do. he said what is this bleeding of sheep that i hear he said oh well you know the people said and we were going to save the best to make an offering to the lord now that sounds religious but throw religion out the door it looked good it sounded good but it wasn't what god said it wasn't what the prophet had said and so it got to the point he was so lifted up amen he was so exalted in himself because of what god had done for him somehow maybe he thought that he had done these things maybe he thought he had lifted himself he had won the battles he had fought the fight that he was a great man i don't know what it was but somehow he was able to take a direct commandment from the lord through a prophet and he was able to twist that to his own desire in his own interpretation and modify what the prophet said i said oh it's a dangerous position to be in when we think because god has anointed us and called us and gifted us and placed us that we've come to a position where we think we can modify what the prophet said because if you despise the commandment if you despise the word you despise him because he is the word what has been opened to us this day the word and to despise that is to despise him it doesn't matter how gifted we are it doesn't matter how much god has done from through us in the past we can never get to a place where we can start modifying the word of the lord to our own understanding let's go to ephesians chapter 5. ephesians chapter 5 verse 25. those husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that should be holy and without blemish god has chosen his own church is that true god has chosen his own church chosen of the lord but that church that he's chosen needs washing that makes sense he chose it so to be chosen of the lord is a wonderful thing but to be chosen of the lord is not the end of god's desire for us because even though you're chosen of god elected and predestinated chosen of god what he has chosen he now has to wash and he is going to wash her by the washing of the water of the word brother bam says an invisible union your first wedding was annulled it was you never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be god come down himself and took your place in the form of the son of god jesus christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how you're going to be washed you're still as spotted as eve was so you can't do what saul did we got to do what david did and even when david failed to keep the commandment amen when nathan come to him and says you know and begins to speak on behalf of the lord and says why have you despised the commandment why have you despised me david immediately says i have sinned against the lord why because i did something contrary to his word and if we won't stand in the water of the word how are we going to be washed if we won't stand under the water of the word that's pouring out in this hour how are we going to be cleaned amen amen brother baby says you're still as spotted as eve is but we've got to come to the washing of the water of the word that's been revealed in this hour amen we've got to stay with that word full obedience full surrender full acknowledgement of the word of god and that word begins to wash us it's not just the choosing alone but it's the choosing and the washing. so he chooses us he gives his word to us he reveals to us our position as his bride he brings us into the fold and then he brings us into the message but then now this word that's been poured out in this day is what god is using to wash all the spots of denomination wash all wash everything away and we've got to stay still under the word and let the word have a full effect and if brother branham said don't do it don't do it if he said kick it out kick it out if he said do this do it do we understand we've got we've got we want to be the bride but we don't want to be washed by the water of the word the word was sent to wash his bride it wasn't said to wash a denomination or wash this the word was sent to wash his bride and his brides got to stay under the washing of the water of the word and let it wash everything out but the man said in the token he said the new testament means the new covenant blood life now life token in us where the old blood stood for a simple sign of the chemistry the old blood of a lamb that was applied it was a simple a sign of the chemistry that a lamb had died the holy ghost is the life that was in the person of jesus christ that's displayed in you and i tonight outside of that there is no mercy only when i see the blood i'll pass over you now brother iran in the token message he's saying something very very crucial for us he's saying in the old testament when they took the paschal lamb and the passover and then they dipped that blood and they applied it the way god told them to apply it like they couldn't apply it their own way they had to apply it you know with the with the the plant that he said take and the way he said take it and strike it the places he said strike it amen it was a complete obedience and a reverence to god in the applying of the blood it wasn't just take the blood and if you get it on there you're fine that's not what he said he's very specific in the way you apply the blood strike the lentil strike the doorpost take the hyssop take this do this slay it at this time take the blood in this way and take this hiss up and apply it here and when the death angel came he says i will pass over you when he came and he saw the right token applied the right way he would pass on and brother branham said in this day he said the token is no longer the chemistry of the blood but it was the life that was in the blood the literal life of jesus christ and that literal life of jesus christ must now come into you but that's not enough it's got to be applied on the outside of the house the way he said to apply the life and when i see that life you know you can say all you want i've got it down in my heart but that's not what brother bannon preached in the token message he didn't preach what you had down in your heart he preached what you had on display on your house and how it was applied matters it all matters everything matters amen it is and he says when i see that i'll pass over you amen not not say well i'm eating on the lamb inside it wasn't the eating on the lamb inside alone that would do it they had to eat on the lamb that was the word on the inside of their house but there had to be an application of the life blood on the outside the way he said so that that death angel would know there is a lamb on the inside of that house how did he know because he could see on the outside what was being fed upon on the inside and that is the exact same way in our lives amen god wants this life the life the token the life the life of jesus christ on the outside of the house on display applied the way he said to apply the life he didn't call for us to be saul and says well you know in this situation and under this application and i don't think god would mind because of this this and that and when you sometimes you go to talk to somebody you know the prophet said this and they'll be like yes but that was then and under those circumstances and now that saul that's the wrong nature well you know the prophet of god said this the scripture says yes but i you know god knows my heart that's a true statement but that doesn't make what you're doing right just by telling the truth doesn't make you right god knows your heart but he told us to apply the token on the outside and the token was to be on display not hid in your heart on display he says again in the token when god places his holy spirit in you which is god and when god places himself within you you're as eternal as god is because you're a part of him because you become a son or daughter of god and you are displaying his word see we're not supposed to be displaying our will oh this hurts this hurts because this is my failure we're not supposed to display our will but we're disposed to display his word he goes hallelujah i feel religious that's true god identifies it himself you've got eternal life and that's god in you and this word is god and that word lives and produces itself just exactly what god has ordained for this age you have it amen the holy ghost the holy spirit being displayed the life of jesus christ on display amen that's why when when when when somebody come to david and says this is this is this and this is that david didn't make an excuse like saul did amen when when samuel the prophet come to saul and told him you know what's the lowing of sheep why haven't you kept the commandment of the lord he said i did keep the commandment only i did this for this reason only i kept back the choices to sacrifice to the lord and thanksgiving for and delivering but god didn't want the choices god didn't want you to do that that's your own willfulness on display but it was religious it was a religious reason oh i want this to come home to us so much all of our religious reasons don't mean nothing what does god want what is he looking for he's looking for somebody that loves him so much that they will surrender their will their wants their desires their thoughts and just take his simple word and just believe it and act on it if he said do this we'd do it if he said don't do this we don't do it amen not to reason it out and i did it yes i did it i did exactly what he said only i didn't do this for this reason but it's okay who says it's okay i want to be like david i want to be like solomon lord i'm just a child i'm not a smart assault i can't figure out that you would want me to keep some best back and and and give you an offering when the prophet didn't tell me to you see where saul put himself you see how well he thought of himself that he could do something above and beyond the commandment of the lord because somehow maybe he knew what was best i don't want to get to the place where where i'm going to go above and beyond amen what the prophet told us because i know best i just want to be like david i want to have a heart that wants to honor god and the only way i know to honor god is to honor his word that's the best way i know just to honor his word just do he says isn't obedience better than sacrifice well samuel tells the saul wouldn't obedience have been more pleasing to god than your fat of rams then all your religious services that you're giving to god wouldn't it be better just to obey him just to be simple and to be childlike to pull yourself down and when somebody you know no doubt somebody may have said to saul hey don't you think it'd be a good idea let's save these and save these and but if he could just take solomon's attitude if he could have said i don't know i mean you might be right you may not be right i don't know all i know is this is what the lord said and i'm going to stay with this until the lord says something else simple why is it we have such a hard time being simple he said in the token he said when you recognize the token the life that it took for the blood to speak you say blood speak wait a minute brother branham the blood speaks the bible says it does and the blood speaks remember the covenant blood is not recognized without the token now the did you catch that statement oh that can go by so fast the covenant blood what is the covenant blood the blood of jesus christ that was shed for our redemption the covenant blood is not recognized without the token what's the token the word on display in our lives the life of jesus christ living through us is the token and the blood of the covenant the blood of the cross of calvary is not recognized without the token which is the baptism of the holy ghost which is the spring into life of the eternal seed gene of god which is the life of jesus christ springing forth out of you and living itself in obedience to the word that is the token amen in the blood of the covenant is not recognized without the token so we can't be compromising on the word and living any way we want and think amen that we've got amen the blood of the covenant atoning for us because it's not recognized without the token the blood speaks remember the covenant blood is not recognized without the token now the word assures us of the promise the token is the sign that the purchase has been made for us and god has accepted it now when you want eternal life you receive a token showing that the price has been paid it isn't the blood but it's the token of the blood it's the life itself it isn't the blood it's the token of the blood which is the life that was in the blood which is the literal life of jesus christ now and you and i does that mean brother chad i'll never mess up that doesn't mean that at all because i believe brother branham had the token life and how many mistakes did he tell us about from the pulpit it's not that it's a life that trumps your life and whenever your life rises it's the life that brings it back into subjection it's the life that lives the line up to the word and time there's not alignment to the word amen it's the very thing that brings us into repentance into obedience and the line back to the word it's the life of jesus christ that's constantly pulling us in line with the word so that our life becomes more word life and more word life and more word life because it's the life of jesus christ he says again in the token the blood is not the token now the life is the token he says again in the token paul tells us talking about speaking of blood paul tells us that the blood speaks you believe the blood speaks in genesis 4 1 or 4 10 god told cain he said where is your brother he said his blood his voice the blood of the voice of his blood calls out against you now we also find in hebrews the 12th chapter 24th verse in the new testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word hallelujah that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and quickens it amen amen amen you know what the blood has a voice today and that voice is speaking and where is that voice speaking i hope is speaking in my life i hope that the life that i'm living in in in obedience to the word of god and subjection to the will of god i hope that that life is a voice speaking of the blood that there is a life on display bible says in the token again we're not come together to talk about the message really we are come together to get in the message and the message is christ he is the word that's right we are to get into it get beneath it yes sir that's what we're supposed to do he was not responsible for any person out from under the blood not one no matter who he was he was not responsible all had to take not only himself but his whole family they're only safe when the token was displayed we cannot feel safe until this token is displayed that's right you must come under this token god's holy spirit and it displays to you jesus christ because it comes and lives in you that's it how can that happen if we're refusing his word because he is the word he's the life of the word how if we keep refusing his word see the token on display will take this word and make it live in our lives and we find areas in our life where we've compromised or let down or disobey amen when that comes to our attention we can do like david and says i've sinned against the lord you know what nathan says next and your sin is put away from you he doesn't say go give me 50 jumping jacks and 40 push-ups and pay alms to all the poor come back and give me your progress report we'll decide whether we're taking you back or not when david was faced with his rejection of the word when it came to him and he realized he had despised the lord he said i have sinned against the lord very next statement and the lord has put your sin away i say god forgive me forgive me i didn't know i was despising you i thought i was just wanting to have my own way but in wanting to have my own way i was loving myself more than i was loving god amen the word is not negotiable the word is not flexible but god is so humble he comes in humility that god doesn't force anything in humility he'll he will subject himself to your willfulness in his humility he lets you make the choice and your willfulness he he lets you exalt yourself above him and he allows it to happen and in his mercy he'll bring it to our attention out of the word and in his mercy he'll put in us a heart that'll say i sinned against the lord i'm sorry god and in his mercy and grace will say and i've put your sin away keep walking my son what is this it's the life on display everyone goes on to say in christ the mystery of god revealed he said he has to have the preeminence and he is the word we talk over and over about he'll have the preeminence he wants the preeminence he wants the preeminence but what is the preeminence it's when the word has preeminence in our lives that's him having the preeminence he says and further on the same message so all things was made by him and since he was made all things made for all of us and all things were made for by him then since that is true we should make our identification should be with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has identified himself with us we should be identified with him how by living for him not just confession so many people take a confession they say i say it's got to the place now are you a christian i'm methodist well that's a long ways from being making yourself known as a christian well look what the methodist does i'm baptist well look what the baptist does i'm catholic look what the catholics does see but the only way that you can actually be a christian is for christ to identify himself in you then he says how we got some stinger there i hope everybody on tape gets that too c c i'll read it again the the only way that you can actually be a christian is for christ to identify himself in you is that what he's doing when we're calling people names speaking evil about dignitaries gossiping and having strife and contention and arguments and speaking evil of his anointing is that the life of jesus christ on display see it's time that we say god forgive me i sinned against you when i spoke evil of that brother i sinned against you when i spoke evil of that government official because who put him there like i said before this is not saying i disagree or i think that's wrong or that man did wrong when we begin to call names mock make fun i think it's time to say lord i sinned against you help me lord not to do it again i've resisted your will in my life help me not to do it again the only way that you can actually be a christian is for christ to identify himself in you you say i'm pentecost pentecostal that don't mean a thing it's christ identified in you that's when he has recognized you say i spoke with tongues devils does too i shouted the mohammedans buddhists and everything shouts the indians scream at the snake dance see sure they all do cults cleanse and everything else scream holler they holler or shout at a baseball game but when christ is identified in you identifying himself then you are christ-like which the word christian means to be christ like what's brother brandon preaching christ the mystery of god revealed christ in you the hope of glory amen the whole unfolding of the seventh seal now in the bride now in you and what does it come down to it comes down to christ being in you and you being like christ super simple there is your identification all right now and since he is our identification then we should be identified with him by living for him let's go to first corinthians 13 and i want to read this as the last scripture i want to read first corinthians 13. verse 1 though i speak with the tongue of men and of angels and have not charity i become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing charity is love agape love god is love god is the word christ is the word christ is love christ is the holy ghost the holy ghost is the word the word is love the word is god god is love you got it that means if we don't have first corinthians 13 we don't even have what we think we have we can have miracles and signs and wonders and not have god because god is love he said we don't have these verses in our lives we can have miracles we can shout and dance but if we don't have this we don't have god because god is love see the whole mystery of the seventh seal to me comes down to this can we be like god on this earth yeah i can be like god i cannot no no can you be like god on this earth like when he came on this earth born in a manger born to parent a mother out of nazareth born in obscurity raised in bethlehem okay can you can you be mocked and scourged and can you be made fun of and can you be ridiculed and laughed at and can you walk around in weakness and humility for 30 years remember jesus ministry was only three and a half years the demonstration of power the manifestation of the of the spoken word the third pool was only three and a half years he had 30 years of what subjection humility learning he learned obedience by the things he suffered he grew and increased he meant his stature with god and with man 30 years of molding character 30 30 years of god's training 30 years of obscurity 30 years as a carpenter's son i want to be like god can we be like god can we walk in humility and obscurity and be nothing because jesus had to be nothing in this earth for 30 years and then god would pick him up and do a work with him after 30 years that would marvel and astound the people but even in their marvel in the astounding astonishment of his ministry he would be rejected he would be called names he would be laughed at and he never called names back he never mocked back he was struck and never struck back can we be like god can we be like christ and the answer is yes because that's what he's called for in this day this is the hour of this manifestation of the bride we can do this but it's going to have to take a death to self it's going to have to say lord i have sinned against you when i said that i sinned against you when i said that about that but i sinned against you when i spoke evil to this preacher i sinned against you god let me die to myself and live like you let's keep reading verse 2 again though i have a gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long in these next few verses he's getting ready to tell you another description of the divine nature he gives it in peter but here's another description of the divine nature charity suffers long and is kind this is love god is love can you draw can you connect the dots charity suffers long and is kind charity envieth not charity wanteth not itself it's not absalom is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoice is not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth that is my calling in life and whenever i fail this it's always by willfulness it's always by self and i want to die to myself and say lord there's many times i sinned against you i thought i was just saying something mean about somebody i thought i was just making a little compromise i thought it was just me and i thought it was just me and the person i was talking with but i realized lord i was sinning against you and i was offending you and i was despising you and anytime i let down on your word i was despising you and anytime i i would touch your anointed i was despising you and i want to say god forgive me for that but let me live this life but abraham says in christ the mystery of god revealed oh if god can get him prisoners like that now that's when he can express the preeminence you see he's he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but christ solomon lord i'm just a child how many today would like to say lord i'm just a human being i'm a human being with a c gene on the inside i don't want to say just a human being and the fact that i'm not predestined like i don't mean it that way but in my human self lord i'm completely childlike i i i don't know what to do next lord the world's changing what's going to happen next is going to require a response from your bride i don't know what the right response is lord you've got to show me in your word i don't know what to do without your word i'm not wise enough i'm not smart enough every time i think i'm smart i found out that i did something wrong i don't know what to do lord would you show me your word you've got a prisoner he's got to get a prisoner so he knows nothing but christ you get what i mean what is christ the word first to express himself completely this is the threefold purpose first to express himself completely god in christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them what does god want the preeminence for so that he can express himself the token the life on display to the world that's why he's trying to get the preeminence and what is the preeminence the preeminence is when the proper headship comes and the headship is the word and when we completely obey the word then we've got the right headship and that gut that's what gives him preeminence there's no way god can have preeminence unless we line up with the word there's no way he can have premise unless we fully obey the word in the token he says your life is gone and you're dead and your life is dead you're hidden god through christ and sealed in there by the holy spirit the mind that was in christ is in you and christ and the bible and the word is the same the love of christ i have to love the word i love the word i love the bible you understand there's no wiggle room for us to change it by our likes christ and the bible and the word is the same in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god now listen he says next then you you raise your hand he's talking about me now then you and the word and god and christ are the same what is that that is his desire for this hour that we're living in the token on display first corinthians 13 on display amen the the divine nature of god on display the statue of a perfect man on display what does he want he wants me to surrender my will and die to myself and he wants me to come up like solomon amen come up out of trash and out of a mess and out of brokenness and out of failure amen i've come out of failure friends i didn't come out of successes brother branham came out of what did he come out of i mean his natural birth what did he come out of a 16 year old mother part cherokee indian an alcoholic father 18 year old alcoholic father who's irish living amen in the deep woods in kentucky in poverty and in a base totally a base why did god bring a prophet that way the same reason he brought solomon the way he brought solomon and why is it we're nothing special why do we come the way we come and why do we keep getting broken in the way we're getting broken and why do we keep getting humbled in the way we get humbled because that's what god that's the recipe that's the ingredients that's what's necessary for god to come up and lift up vessels that he can glorify himself in he doesn't want us to erect monuments to ourselves he doesn't want us amen to manipulate his word based off our own religious ideas he he just wants humility and obedience and a full surrender so he can have the preeminence by his word amen when he has the premise by his word then he can display himself in this world today guess what he's predestinated to do it in me now what gives me hope and what gives me courage is the fact that before the foundation of the world he chose me to come into this vessel of clay so he could take that life on the inside and bring this vessel subject and display himself to this world and he's raised up a bride that will not fail not because of her merit but in her humility she recognizes his purpose is bigger than my plan she said all she has to do is surrender all he's looking for is a childness like solomon had all he's looking for is a surrender and a humility and a need brother branham would preach before thousands tens of thousands of people and he would operate a gift so beautifully that thousands upon thousands of times you would see the miraculous before human eyes but in all of that he would stand there he would call for a line people would be standing there and he would just start stalling and talking and in front of tens of thousands of people who were claiming to him to be a great religious figure to be a great man and he would just start talking and then he would just start saying you know friends and god has commissioned me and start telling stories and he says now you know i'm waiting for something this is what god wants this is what he wants you know i'm waiting for something i'm waiting for him and he starts him hauling around and telling stories and stalling because he can do nothing he can do nothing in himself brother branham wasn't there for the show he wasn't there for the accolades he wasn't there to build himself a monument he was there to be a tool in god's hand and god would choose the humblest of the humblest see now you know i'm waiting for something i'm waiting for him then look what he does next now if i've said anything wrong now if i've said anything wrong god forgive me and if i and if i said anything i've hurt you if i've done anything wrong my goodness friends can't we see what god is like god has given us on tape and in a couple videos god has given us a mature son of god on display with the token on display so that we can see what it's like he didn't work up a crowd he didn't start beating up the music he didn't start trying to force things to happen he didn't try to make himself the the great gifted one he was the one with a great gift but he couldn't do anything without god and he wasn't ashamed to tell thousands of people who were treating him like jesus christ he wasn't ashamed to tell thousands of them now you know i'm waiting for something i i can't do anything without him and on top of that when the when he doesn't feel the presence of the lord and doesn't feel that that anointing kicking the gear he starts humbling himself and repenting before the people for anything he might have said or done that would be wrong and after he begins to humble himself he says he's here he's here why did god make that video for me because i needed to see that that's that is the life of jesus christ you may have fantastic gifts you may you may have you may you know have the gift of tongues and interpretation or have the gift of visions and dreams and interpretation of dreams and vision you may have supernatural ability and ability with healing in your hands you may have all kinds of dynamic powerful gifts but if you don't have that humility that i saw on brother branham i'm not interested i we're not to be chasers of gifts we're to be a lover of the giver and if god does anything through us through a gift through a ministry gift through songs or through the ability to write songs through the supernatural things that happen through supernatural sensitivities if god if any of those gifts are operating in our life it has nothing to do with us it's something that he's wanting to do but the best way to get that gift to operate is to humble ourselves and realize that we are nothing and we can do nothing without him and in humility let god take a child in solomon lord i'm but a child i don't know how to go out come in before these people and god would take that child and give him a kingdom like it's never been before and give him wisdom that nobody before and nobody after has had sense until jesus christ come on the earth why because he could be a child jesus when they're disputing who's the greatest among the kingdom who will be number one who'll be number two who'll be on the right hand and the left hand jesus grabs a little child and he brings a little child into their midst and says unless you humble yourself and become like this you'll not even see the kingdom the way up is down you could take solomon and build a kingdom that'll be a type of jesus christ millennial reign why because he could start like a child and he could come from humble origins absalom god could have never used absalom i want god to use me not for me realize how many times we've wanted god to use us for us how many times have we wanted god to do the supernatural so that we can get credit so that our church will be right so that we'll be vindicated god help us i want to serve god for god not for me and i want god to use me for him not for me and i want god to be glorified not me if he's going to have a bride in this end time and he is if he's going to have a bride that he's going to do supernatural things through it's going to be that kind of bride i say god the way up is down lord i can do nothing without you i'm just a child and i don't want to be above that i i'm just a child but i'm not asking you make me not a child i'm just asking use me like a child use me as i am lord i'm not asking you to get make me wise i'm not asking you to make me rich i'm not asking for anything i'm just telling you what i am i'm just a child and i don't know how to do that would you please help me if we could stay there friends we'll see mighty things we'll see mighty things because god wants to show himself mighty this is the hour for his life to be on display this is the this is the time when he's going to show himself in bride form but the way up is down it's not what we think it's what he wants to do through us let's all stand musicians and like if you can come i just want to make a statement to you that the prophet made over and over and over again if i could just say it this way a greater than solomon is here do you believe that a greater than solomon is here he was there when brother branham announced it he's here this morning a greater than solomon is here solomon in his kingdom was the greatest solomon in his wealth was the greatest solomon in his wisdom was grace and there's a greater than solomon here but what he's looking for he's looking for that nature where paul could say i count it all but dung where moses could leave all the all the riches of egypt and forsake it for the reproach of christ for those that can be born humble and below and be nothing and recognize through nothing and stand before their brothers and sisters and say i don't have answers i can't tell you i don't know who can sit in the corner of a cave after having a reputation of being a giant slayer and pluck a stringed instrument and weep to the lord and say lord save me i cannot save myself deliver me o lord because i have no way to deliver myself that's what god loves that's the kind of warrior he's looking for that's the kind of bride he wants to have this is what we want this is what we want i just want to be whatever he wants me to be let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for your word god we recognize lord through your word the nature that you have used all through your bible lord the men that you've chosen lord they've been men that were rejected outcasts trodden down marginalized but god that's what you wanted they were men who had to be abased who had to unlearn things that they had learned wrong they had the forsake fineries and riches [Music] lord so that you could use them men who had to die to their own wills and their own selfishness god you're so good to us that you come in our day in our generation when we can have audio recordings in video and you brought another one of those men up lord out of humility out of poverty but with no connections nor with no resources you grabbed a man and our brother brother branham lord and you raised him up before us to show what it's like to be a son of god to have the token on display to have christ live his life through a human vessel and god you showed it to us so that we wouldn't be mistaken lord so that we can identify the counterfeit the counterfeit comes in eric can see in pride it may be gifted it may have gifts lord that far outshine any gift we may have but lord it's a counterfeit if it doesn't have that life god i pray that you would make me match that life lord that there would be no counterfeit on display here but there would be a genuine dollar bill lord that you would mold me in your great meant lord you would make me what you want me to be lord we as your children we want to say we're just children lord we're just but children we don't know lord we don't know which way the world will turn we don't know what direction things will go and we don't know what we'll do about it when we get there but god i know one thing you put a desire in my heart for you you put a love in there that didn't come from my human birth you put a seed in there and you've brought it to life for your purpose and i want to surrender to that god show us in your word keep revealing your word to us so that we might take your word above our thinking that we might take your word above our will that we might take your word and surrender to that word so you can have preeminence because that word is our headship and gone by our simple humble submission to that word we pray god that you would lift this vessel up for your glory and use it to magnify your name and to show your great purpose in this age god forgive us for offending you forgive us for despising you in our actions and in our words make us true oh god make us right lord burn out the dross and cleanse our heart let your love abound in us god i love you i thank you god for your word i thank you that you love us enough to expose us that we might forsake our sins and forsake ourselves and follow after you oh you're precious to us we love you lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen you know the word of god says the bride has made herself ready how did she make herself ready she took this word and she dressed herself in it what is it addressing the word it's the life of christ on display it's the presentation to the world of the word alive not the word in here the word living out here amen let's sing the song change my heart [Music] make it ever true [Music] change my heart oh god may i be like you change my heart oh change my heart oh god [Music] make it ever true [Music] may i be like you [Music] i am [Music] [Applause] this is what i pray change my heart oh god make it ever true change my heart oh god may i be like you are the [Music] i am [Applause] hold me and make me this is what i pray make it ever true change my heart oh god [Music] may i be like i just want to say i love you i love you all thankful that we get to serve the lord together thank for what he's doing in our lives i say as we leave don't be ashamed if it looks like the bride begins to get weaker that's perfect [Music] the crowning of brother branham's ministry is when ten thousand of his friends left him and the big meetings had died down the accolades and the articles and the paper and and all of the fanfare and hype had diminished and they the full gospel businessman was trying to pull away from him they wouldn't even had him anymore if it hadn't been for brother carl williams his friends were pulling away and thinking that he had went off and now he was washed up and his ministry was over and he begins to talk all about this and it was god bringing the crowning of the ministry in the revelation of the seventh seal paul looked like he was washed up he was sick and the lord wouldn't heal him he was in prison and the lord wouldn't deliver him gave demas the right to leave him because of the weakness that paul had but in his weakness we have a bible [Music] and what some thought was the diminishing of his ministry was the bible that we carry with us it looked like david was washed up when he left jerusalem a defeated king [Music] say don't don't try to look good anymore don't worry about what other people think and what other people say don't worry about trying to present a certain image or being vindicated or justified don't worry about trying to say you know we have this many healings proving that we're right or we have this we've had this america we've had that don't worry about any of that don't try to prove anything just watch watch what god will do watch him bring things humble lower smaller broken just watch him do it and don't be surprised if if it looks like things are diminishing in the bride she's getting weaker [Music] she's getting pushed around by the government [Music] she's being backed into a corner and marginalized and losing privileges and losing this and god's letting it all happen don't get nervous don't get one drop nervous just relax do you know why david ran away from jerusalem it wasn't because he was scared of absalom in his army he left because he knew absalom was coming and that absalom would smite the inhabitants of jerusalem with the edge of the sword and so in order to spare the people david humbled himself and left his throne and left his kingdom david wouldn't stand and fight because david knew if this is god's will and god gave it to me god will keep it for me i can walk away for the sake of everybody else i can leave [Music] and then when he left god took care of it all and then when he brought him back he brought him back in peace and he brought him back in security and brought him back to the throne that god gave him if god has given us our positions bride who's going to take it away and if god has given us his power and his authority who's going to take it away and if god has given us his promised word who's going to take it away nobody amen but if somebody wants it let them have it if they take your coat give them the coke as well because if it's yours it'll come back we don't have to fight we don't have to defend ourselves we don't have to get aggressive we can get weaker and it'll be perfect we can be diminishing and it'll be great let god do it let's quit trying to do stuff on our own let god do it we've tried so hard to be mighty and we're still weak true so hard to be validated and people still think we're crazy so hard to prove that we're normal they still think we're not so quit trying to prove anything don't vindicate validate anything let god do what god wants to do just stay in humble submission to his word that's what god likes don't be surprised at what comes next just stay submissive to the lord let him fight let him defend let him exalt let
