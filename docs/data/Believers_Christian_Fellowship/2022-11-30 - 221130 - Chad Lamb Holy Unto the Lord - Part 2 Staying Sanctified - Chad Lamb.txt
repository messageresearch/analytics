First Peter chapter 1 verse 13. wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is Holy so be holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for I am Holy amen God bless you as you see them amen I'm going to continue with this thought and that take it to the next part and and this is where we ended Sunday but I want to continue on with where we ended brother Frank if you could go ahead and bring up the white board I'll use that and I think we saved the the drawing that I had on there the words that I held on there from last week and we'll begin with that so the scripture says be holy for I am Holy amen God is Holy and he wants us to be holy amen and and when we talked about holy unto the Lord last time we talked about some of the wrong ideas carried over from denominationalism about Holiness right we had the the wrong concept and I don't know about all of you but I speak for myself many times I had the wrong idea of what it meant to be holy or to walk in Holiness amen I had more of a legalistic idea growing up that to be holy was to be perfect with no flaw completely sinless and in a perfect state but that's not really what it means to be holy amen that's not exactly what it means really what it means is to be set apart Amen to be to be set apart or to be sacred and so we saw this is uh the two words I put up here and I got these from the the Old Testament from the words that are used holy are Sanctified or sanctifieth uh holy you can be can mean to be sacred or set apart and so we we talked about that last week how God himself is Holy in himself within himself he is Holy amen but God called the children of Israel to be a holy nation amen and they weren't holy within themselves they were holy because he set them apart he selected them out of all Nations to be set apart for him that made them holy right then out of the the 12 tribes he selected One Tribe the Levites to be the priest and made them holy which means set apart for the office of the priesthood amen right and then our and for the Levites to take care of the Tabernacle to do all of those works but then out of the Levites he chose Aaron and his children and to be in the order of the priests and to the high priest amen so they were holy unto the Lord it didn't mean that they were perfect without flaw and it didn't mean they were holy within themselves but they were made Holy by God's choice by God setting them apart and consecrating them for a purpose that made them holy so when we look at to be holy it's to be sacred or to be set apart and then to sanctify is to separate to sanctify as the act of separating or to be separate sometimes when they say sanctify or sanctify means it's separated or to consecrate so if something's consecrated it's Sanctified it's Sanctified for that purpose and you know we talked about we we have Sanctified this Sanctuary for the worship of God that's all we do in here it's Sanctified it's set aside it's consecrated it's set apart for that purpose and so it's Sanctified for that purpose it's not Sanctified it's not holy it's not consecrated because of the fabric of the carpet or the chairs right we went through all of that we understand that it's not holy in itself it's not sacred in itself or Sanctified in itself it's Sanctified because of the purpose all right so that's where we were and so we're going to move on from there so I want to look at a couple words that we're going to find in the New Testament and so I want to write these down again and refer to these so in the New Testament this word in First Peter 1 with this passage we read First Peter 1 13 and we find it in verse 15 and 16 when it says holy he which called you is Holy so be you holy in all manner conversation this word holy is the English word holy well I'm gonna I'm gonna move that out of here and try again so this English word holy it means that which is holy okay it doesn't tell you how it became holy it's just that it is Holy this word is used 161 times in the New Testament for Holy the majority of that is Holy Ghost or holy spirit so we talk about holy ghost or holy spirit it's holy within itself it's holy it's it's it is Holy but it's used 61 time it's it's 61 times it's translated Saints so the children of God the Saints in the New Testament they're holy but they're not holy within themselves they've been made holy amen they're holy because God chose them God elected them God selected them God cleansed them God set them apart for his purpose that made them holy amen so holy in the New Testament is that which is holy but it doesn't tell you how it became holy it's either holy in itself it's translated four times as the Holy One referring to Jesus Christ he's holy the Holy Ghost is Holy the holy God is Holy amen the Saints are holy amen but we've been made Holy by his selection and for his purpose amen that's important so then there's another word and sometimes these words are used interchangeably the that they're not always holy or Holiness is attached to the same Greek word they're used somewhat interchangeably so but I'm just going to write it down in the main usage just for clarity of understanding so I want to write down the word sanctify the word sanctify means to separate and dedicate to God to separate and to dedicate to God now it's it's got another usage in the New Testament I'm not going to write down because this thing's not working really well and that's got a long delay but but when you look at this word it means to separate and dedicate to God and either render or acknowledge it to be Hollow or sacred so either you either you're rendering it or making it to be Hollow or sacred or acknowledging that it is hollow or sacred that's what this word sanctify can mean and we'll get into that in a minute you'll understand what what it is the third one that we're going to look at is sanctification and that means to consecrate or purify all right so these three words are used in the New Testament they're used somewhat interchangeably so we're going to get into this and look at it let's look at First Peter chapter 2 and verse 9. it says but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light so here it says you are a holy nation and he is referring to the Gentiles that have now come to Christ they are a holy nation so before he says be holy for I am Holy God is Holy amen but you're to be holy by him choosing you and calling you out and separating you and sanctifying you he is making you holy he made the Gentiles who are not a people a people and he made them Holy by his purpose amen by setting them apart for his purpose this is what God has done amen and so that they are holy because God made them holy I mean because of his purpose now let's turn to Second Thessalonians and keep your Bibles handy I want to go to several scriptures and read several scriptures like we did on Sunday 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13. but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you brother and beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth this word sanctification when it says here through sanctification of the spirit this sanctification is that last one that we wrote down consecration or purifier purification amen so God has chosen you Amen to Salvation through sanctification or purification of the spirit and belief of the truth this is where brother bam talks about amen this second work of Grace and I'll read it again out of birth pains he said so it is in the spiritual realm it's water justification by faith believing on God receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized second is sanctification of the spirit that God cleanses the spirit from all elements of the world and the desire of the world and then the Holy Spirit comes in and gives New Birth and fills up the Sanctified vessel for instance like this now that I told you what you don't uh uh what you don't believe lay aside then take the pie notice a glass is laying out in the chicken yarn you don't just pick that up and put it on your table and fill it up with water or milk no you pick it up it's justification cleansing it is sanctification because the Greek word sanctifies a compound words means cleansed and set aside for service not in service for service then when you fill it it is put in service so this is all God making something holy first he accuses it by his own election and draws it to himself and when you come to that understanding that's your justification recognizing that God is calling you amen and then God Amen will sanctify he'll bring you through a process of purification amen where he says where he cleanses the spirit from all elements of the world he's doing a work in your spirit Realm amen and then thirdly so that's to cleanse and set aside for service remember holy in the Holy in the Old Testament was to set apart this is the process God is bringing us through because he wants us to be a holy people amen the Saints and the New Testament are holy God is called holy and the Saints are called by the same word so whatever he is they are he's bringing them to a process amen of purification amen our consecration so that he can pour himself his Spirit into them bring them to a new birth burn out all of Amen all over the world Amen and bring the seed of God to life so his life lives in them and now they are holy set aside amen sacred amen they are a hallowed vessel because God is working through them they're put into service amen so this word sanctification is consecration or to purify and this is what God is doing to make his children holy amen and let's let's look at First Peter again let's go back to First Peter chapter one we're going to see the same exact word used again in First Peter chapter one verse 2. he says in First Peter 1 and 2 elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied amen so God is going to do this purification work in you because he's chosen you to be holy like he chose Israel to be holy like he chose Levites to be holy like he chose Aaron to be holy he chose you to be holy amen only now in order for you to be holy he's got to do a work in your spirit realm amen and that's a work of Consecration and purification this is how brother Brown says it in future home he says then secondly he's talking about the second work of Grace then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness see brother man when he's talking about this second work of Grace he's talking about gone doing a cleaning work in your spirit realm amen so that he can bring something deeper into the soul he's got to do a work in the spirit realm take away the desires for sin amen do a work and set your mind in order for holiness to think right he said I'll read that again secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right amen this sanctification begins the process of getting us to think right we used to think like the world thought amen what was normal to the world was normal to us amen the deeds and the actions and everything everybody else did was normal but then God Amen will call us to himself and plucks us out of the Heap of humanity and we recognize his calling us and we when we we yield to that call and then he begins to do a work in the spirit realm setting our mind and Holiness so that we can even begin to think right we begin to recognize this is wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong that's the work that he's doing he's sanctification is a compound Greek words which means cleansed and set aside for service then the next comes the baptism of fire in the Holy Ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's him I say Amen so now he's going deeper amen justification is saying you're mine your whole being is mine I'm calling you to myself but then he starts working setting our mind in order amen cleansing our spirit realm so that he can burn out the world burn out the sin nature from our soul amen and put the Holy Ghost Inside then we can be a saint holy set apart for his purpose and used in that purpose all right let's go back to Ephesians now it's amazing that we we go through things and we've we've learned these things the the prophet of God taught it we know some of these basic things and understand this for years amen but every time I find that I go through a subject again it just becomes more alive and more relevant in my understanding becomes a little bit deeper and and so the same thing with this in Ephesians 5 25 I want to use this scripture and compare it to another it says Ephesians 5 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for him that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot a wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so this is a work that God is doing right he wants a holy bride he's holy his wife must be holy so what is he going to do to make sure she's holy he's going to wash her cleanse her with the water of the word so he is so verse verse 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word so this word sanctifies this middle word over here to separate and dedicate to God so he's washing her he's separating her by the word the word is bringing separation remember we talked about Sunday that is as soon as we choose one thing we it means we don't choose another the moment we come to the word and we recognize the word is truth there's a whole lot of things that's become untrue things that we thought were true habits that we had Lifestyles that we thought were okay when the minute that God reveals the word to us amen and we recognize that that is true when recognizing that is true it automatically brings a separation because if we will come to that word we must leave something else we must leave a former understanding we must leave a formal lifestyle a former habit but to come to the word so the word is bringing separation so it's cleansing us from the old ideas it's washing us it's washing old Concepts old ideas old habits away and so it's cutting the world away from us but he's that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so so Christ gave himself so that he could sanctify and cleanse the Brine and and wash her away this is the work that he is doing he's doing it by his word so this word sanctify means to separate the the uses that they give in the Scofield is to are the uh not the Scofield but Strong's Concordance to separate from profane things and dedicate to God to consecrate also to render or acknowledge something to be venerable or hallowed or sacred it's either to make it sacred or to acknowledge that it's sacred it can be used either way and in this case what he's doing is he's making her Sacred by separating her from the World by cutting her off and out cutting all things and washing all things away and setting her apart so that he can use her so she can be holy and Without Blame but I want to look at another use of the word so that we can get a full understanding same word let's go back to First Peter again only this time we'll go to First Peter chapter 3. First Peter chapter 3. and verse 13. who is he that will harm you if you be followers of that which is good but and if you suffer for righteousness sake happy or ye be not afraid of their Terror and either be troubled but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts sanctify the Lord God in your hearts does this mean that your to clean or purify the Lord no how can you purify the Lord this so remember the word means to render or acknowledge something to be venerable or hallowed or sacred this is acknowledging that he's holy acknowledging so the word can be so you see here this this word sanctify can be used both ways it's either to render it hollowed or Sanctified or sacred or to acknowledge that it is and in this usage it's but sanctify the Lord God in your heart God doesn't need you to purify him what God needs you to do is acknowledge that he's holy amen acknowledge that he's sacred and acknowledge Him in your heart amen so I want us to understand that because the one of the reasons that I want to look at this is because when we see that brother Benham took this word sanctification and he begins to show us the second work of Grace to where God will justify us by grace and he'll sanctifies setting our mind in order for Holiness and fill us then with his spirit and put us into service amen that's not the end of sanctification or being Sanctified or consecrated or set apart amen this goes on for life amen that's what I want us to understand that it's not as simple to say well I was I was saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost you're still being Sanctified amen you're still being consecrated to God there's a part that he does but there's a part that we do ourselves and so I want to look at that in the scripture so that we don't stay in only this part of the plan of God but we understand the whole plan of God when it comes to being Sanctified and being holy brother man goes on to say in broken sisters to me he is the Waters of the word of Separation that separates you from everything that's contrary to his word that's the fountain I believe in to be yes sir that's the waters that separated me from man-made cisterns to the Fountain of Living Water amen that water should still be separating us not just once amen now I'm filled with the Holy Ghost amen that water should still be separating us separating us from attitudes separating us from lust separating us from selfishness separating us from old Concepts this word should still be sanctifying us it should still bringing it should be bringing us into a greater consecration as we move on Amen we can't say the work of sanctification was already done that was God working in your mind so that he could get to your heart now that he's got to your heart amen he wants to live from there and serve his purpose but to do that you're going to have to stay in agreement with his purpose he set us aside and called us holy we must stay set aside God has never taken away free choice from us it's not that we went through this process we're born again and all of a sudden God ripped from us free choice Takes Over Us completely and now it doesn't matter what we want to do God's just doing whatever with us this is not how it works God put himself on partnership with man he remains on partnership with man God is faithful to his part but he's asking you to surrender and submit and stay Sanctified and stay consecrated and we'll see that clearly through the scripture now let's go to Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews chapter 12 verse 5. and ye have forgotten exhortation with speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and Scourge us every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness God is helping us with our sanctification through chastisements right verse 11. now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward that yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down in the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed that's what this chastisement will do it'll heal that part in you that's going astray follow peace with all men in Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man so it says verse 14 follow peace with all men and holiness all right follow peace and Holiness this word Holiness is this word sanctification Consecration and purify but this isn't the work that he did for you amen when he brought you to the bathroom the Holy Ghost he's telling you to follow after purification you follow after consecration now this is your part follow peace with all men and Holiness sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness spring up and trouble you and there might many be defiled so God the same word that's used for God sanctifying you by the spirit is telling you to you follow after this sanctification you strive for you follow after you follow consecration and the message here ye him he says this is the washing of the water Separation by the word the word that what washes us and cleanses us and sanctify them Father through the truth he said Thy word is truth is that rhyme and we're washed of the Waters of separation from our sins by the word of God the word separates us and sets us in place so now we we saw now when the word is revealed we have a choice to make and in choosing the word we automatically separate from something we separate from our sin we separate from our conduct we separate from our thinking but this word god also uses in chastisement has anybody ever been chastised and in the preaching of the word the word brings chastisement Amen in that chastisement is gone as a father amen wanting us to be a partaker of his Holiness he is bringing sanctification this is not just before the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is after the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are his child he is the father and he is making sure that by his word we either choose amen we always choose but we either see the word and come to it or he'll bring chastisement to break us away from the thing that's not the word to bring us in line with his word and no chastisement for the present is joyous but Grievous but it brings the Peaceable fruits of righteousness because he is a father wants us to go the right way so he'll use the word even in chastisement so let's go to Second Corinthians now chapter six second Corinthians chapter six this is another good old-fashioned Bible study second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 14. be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with below or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of of the Living God and God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people therefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and I will be a father unto you and you shall be his sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty so God calls for separation to come out from among them what part do we have being unequally yoked with unbelief come out from among them amen and be ye separate that's why there was a call that came in Revelations 18 that says come out from among her my people amen and and brother Branham amen was the angel that God used to make that call and that's the call the bride is still calling come out amen don't be in those systems that are anti-word Antichrist but come out why come out be separate he's calling to holiness wants us to be a separated people separated from unbelief separated from sin separate why because we're holy what's it mean to be holy to be separated we're holy for his purpose in The Invisible union he says your first wedding was annulled it was you never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be God come down himself and took your place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the Water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you why he wants you to be purified to be holy to be separated but listen to the next statement but if you won't stand in the water of the word how are you going to be washed you're still as spotted as Eve was so now we know that the second work of Grace is sanctification God dealing cleaning your spirit setting your mind in order for Holiness so he could fill you with himself so they could put you into service amen but he's now saying it's not just something that he's going to do he's done it he's given the word he's continually giving the word but if we won't stay in the washing of the word how are we going to be unspotted we have to stay surrendered to the word we have to stay in the washing of the word because he never takes free moral agency away we can never just say we can never just lay down and say if God wants me to be holy he'll make me holy he'll make you holy but you've got to stay under the word he'll he'll purify he'll consecrate he'll he'll he'll clean your life but you must stay under the cleaning agent and the cleaning agent is this word that's been given in this generation it has a purifying Force to purify and wash away the stains of the prostitute spirits that come through the nominationalism the stain of the world that brings out false ideas amen it has a purifying Force to wash away to set us apart for Holiness but we must stay under the word amen it's not a one-time thing it's a continual washing why do we keep coming back to church why do we keep reading books why do we keep reading our Bible why do we stay in prayer why do we keep playing the tapes so that we can stay under the washing of the water of the word to stay consecrated to stay Sanctified to stay separated praise God and I'm just going to read the scripture to John 17. you don't have to turn there amen John 17 17 I read it last time Jesus in Paris has sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth so this word sanctify amen is this uh oh I don't know which word it is yeah it's the same word the second one to separate and dedicate to God to render or to acknowledge something hallowed or sacred and he's saying sanctify them through the truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth so now Jesus is talking about sanctifying sanctifying the disciples being Sanctified by the word being purified then he's talking about sanctifying himself well these are two different usages of the same word one is to render or to make something hallowed or sacred and one is to separate amen and consecrate to God so he's saying sanctify them make them sacred through the washing of the word but he's saying and I sanctify he's saying I'm consecrating myself and dedicating myself to this purpose so that they can be rendered holy does that make sense the same word but two different usages and the same passage of scripture one is he I'm separating myself amen consecrating myself and dedicating myself for the purpose that you purpose me for so that the word can render them and make them purified and hollowed so that they can serve the purpose that you purpose them for so one in one sense of the word we are purified or we are rendered we are made amen hallowed are Sacred by the word and another sense of the word we are consecrating and dedicating ourselves for God's purpose one is him cleaning us and one is us staying consecrated and both of that is to sanctify it takes two parts God must do his part and we must do our part in the message adoption part three says oh Jesus was training 12 men that through these 12 men these 12 men was to take the gospel to the world he said for their sakes I sanctify myself make yourself for your neighbor's sake for somebody else's sake don't use your Liberty for a cloak said Paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to let your communication if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do amen so here this is this is not brother Benham saying amen God's work of sanctification will purify you for the baptism Holy Ghost no you already you're already in purpose you're already in use now sanctify yourself for somebody else's purpose now this is something we do that's what I want to talk about for the rest of the time we have this evening is what we do now remember we want we never want to lose track of how we started that the idea of Holiness the old denominational the old Methodist the old Nazarene uh the old Pilgrim Holiness idea of Holiness and the Holiness Pentecost which is what I came out of as a boy that idea won't work that idea that through deeds and conducts and obedience that I can become holy in my own effort of obeying and being kind and being kind and obeying the word and all of that no no that'll never you can never be holy till first he's designated you to be holy that's the first step he must be elected to that position you must be chosen by God you cannot Choose Yourself and say through conduct I'll be holy it'll never work is that right yeah but if we're ever if we're ever deemed holy it's because he deemed us holy amen and he made us holy and he chose us to be holy and he provided the word that will purify us and sanctifies so that we could be set apart to be a holy vessel unto him it's all got to be him first but that doesn't mean we're not supposed to obey the word but The Obedience of the word cannot make us holy all right so when I go into the second part I don't want any of us to slip into Old thinking this has nothing to do with us climbing into a position or making ourselves anything this has everything to do with us recognizing what God has called us to be and separating from everything else to stay consecrated to that purpose that I now know who I am I now know why I'm in this generation I now know what he called me for I now know his purpose in my life and now I choose to stay separated from everything that would take me away from that purpose so that I sanctify myself to stay consecrated to this purpose does that make sense it's not a self holiness but it's a it's a surrender to the will of God in our lives and the message the Queen of Sheba brother man says God make every man and woman in here tonight a Christian like unto that that can display such a love in their hearts that they'll be such a Christian live such an unspotted life from the world until their neighbors will know that they are real Christians and want to be like them Jesus said I sanctify myself for their sakes and brother Benham said do that for your neighbor and here he comes right back and he starts saying let them live such unspotted life from the world how can I live an unspotted life from the world stay in the word until their neighbors will know that they are real Christians and want to be like them consecrate ourselves for their sakes let's go back to First Peter chapter two we read the first part of this but I want to read what follows in First Peter chapter 2. First Peter chapter 2 verse 9. but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which has not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy dearly beloved I beseech you as a strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul have your conversation honest among the Gentiles that where whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation what is Peter saying Peter's saying live a Sanctified life live a Sanctified life be separate abstain from fleshly Lost he's he's saying you do that you do it you live Sanctified you live to the word you live separated you do it so that they will see your life and glorify God amen let's go back to First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 5. this is like a sword drill in the New Testament how fast can we turn there first Corinthians chapter five verse 9. now I want to set this in because we saw what Paul said in second Corinthians that don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers be separated come out from among them and be separate and I will receive you but I want to look at what Paul says here because this is a good sound instruction First Corinthians 5 and 9. said I rode into you in an epistle not to company with fornicators yet not all together with the fornicators of this world are with the Covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must you needs go out of the world but now I have written unto you not to keep Company If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or Covetous or adulterer or a or a drunkard or an extortioner which such a one know not to eat the reason I wanted to put this in there is sometimes we get the idea of come out from among them and be you separate amen as as that we're not even to associate with anybody in the world but they're the ones that are supposed to see your Godly life they're the ones that are supposed to be affected by your sanctification so you know he says I he says I told you not to keep company with a fornicator he said but not yet all together with the fornicators of this world for then you must need to go out of the world there's no way to survive if we're going to stay separated from everybody living in sin we have to work together you have to work sometimes on projects together you have to sometimes have dinner together you sometimes have to travel together with co-workers with family members with people who are unbelievers and they may be in this position Amen to be separate is not necessarily saying that I'm never going to I'm never going to eat lunch with somebody who's a fornicator no he says if somebody be called a brother and be in that condition amen there's leaven in the lump there don't associate if he's called a brother but a worldly person that's how they live so if we if we take this separation too far who's going to see your Godly life amen if we go to communal living and we all go up somewhere let's go buy land in Montana amen let's get a big Ranch and we'll all work it together it'll be just us and we won't let sin in the door that's not what he wants us Sanctified for he wants us to be consecrated to our purpose so that we've been Sanctified for their sakes for the fornicator in the cubicle next to you amen for the idolater amen amen that goes to the Catholic church that you eat lunch with that's who he wants you to be Sanctified for that's why it's so important amen when we're at work amen that we keep ourselves in sanctification because it's so easy to join the crowd I mean I know what it's like I worked it's so easy Amen to just enter in with the conversation and everything's going fine you're having a fine conversation we're talking about family then all of a sudden it turns and it turns to something lustful or something ungodly or something dirty amen and then you're stuck there you know what to do I've been in this conversation the conversation goes wrong amen we've got to understand that we must stay Sanctified for their sakes I can't join in the dirty conversation and laugh at the dirty jokes and they'll see amen the light shining out of me if I just enter in the crowd neither can I stay completely separate and have nothing to do with unbelievers you see God Amen said you're in the world but not of the world Amen he's put us in our workplaces for a reason he's put us in our families for a reason he's put us in the places we are for a reason and we are to stay consecrated Sanctified for the purpose that he's put us here and what is that purpose so that his life can live through us so we must stay where God has placed us amen we must let the light shine but we must keep ourselves consecrated to our purpose when we can't just join in every conversation we can't just we we even though we must be there we must be associated with the people God's put us in association with and we might but we must stay Sanctified for their sakes so sometimes it's a it's a tightrope to walk but I believe God will give Grace he's put us there for a reason when the conversation goes wrong and you find a polite way to excuse yourself not condemning not saying you all with your filthy Mouse I'm out here but you find a polite way to excuse yourself it won't take long till they notice he doesn't go for that you don't have to be rude you don't have to be belligerent you don't have to be condemning you just have to stay consecrated to your purpose God didn't put me on this Earth to laugh at dirty jokes he put me here to shine forth his life and that's what I must stay Sanctified to that's what I must stay consecrated to so you realize when we when you don't know who you are and you don't know what your purpose is then we just Meander through life but this this Revelation that God opened to us in this day tells us exactly who we are and exactly what our purpose is and then and then we know what am I consecrating myself to to that purpose amen that's what God wants that's why he's called me to be holy in this day to be used for his purpose in the message of the Hidden life with Christ he says God didn't put you here to work in a factory just alone that means he didn't your whole purpose is not just to work in a factory he puts you here as a testimony a written epistle read of all men to live an honorable and decent life in a hid consecrated life with God so that men would know that Jesus Christ still lives and Reigns that's why you're here and that's why you work in that factory if you want them to know why you're where you're at this is why you're where you're at amen so that those around you will know that Christ lives and Reigns it goes on to say uh well let's read James and then we'll get to this next clue James chapter 2. as I was looking into this study and I was going through the scripture so many scriptures came alive fresh again James chapter 2. verse 17. James chapter 2 verse 17. it says even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yea a man may say thou has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works this is so interesting because when you read James brother Benham addressed this issue because it looks like James is contradicting Paul in the in the Romans in the Book of Romans because because Romans is saying that it's not by works but it's by faith amen Abraham received the promise not of works but by faith amen and here he's saying without works your faith is dead it looks like it's contrary to one another but brother banham comes and he makes it so simple to understand he said your faith is what God sees your works is what mankind sees that's why James says here he says a man may say Verse 18 thou has faith and I have worked show me thy faith without thy works like how can I see your faith show me your faith with no works you can't show it it's impossible to see James is saying show me Mike show me your faith go ahead show it to me take it out and show it I mean you've got it you can't show faith without works and he says I will show thee my faith by my works that's why brother Venom said take me to a man's office take me to his home let me see the books he reads let me see the posters that he has on the wall I'll tell you what's in him amen and so the The Works declare the faith and he's he's James is dispelling this myth that all I have to do is believe amen it doesn't matter what I do amen you can't do in order to be accepted by God that's not the that's the point Abraham righteousness was imputed unto him not because of the works that he did but because of the faith that he had but it doesn't mean that works aren't important The Works are the light that we shine to the world that declare our faith amen so James is bringing it to the highlight and making it important what you do declares what you believe that's why it doesn't work to be a Sunday believer in a Monday mixer we're separated on Sunday but we're mixing on Monday that doesn't work that's James is telling you that's not working that's what James is saying that's not working but we must be separated on Sunday and separated on Monday and separated on Tuesday and separated when we're tired on Thursday and separated when we we're having a bad day and everything's going wrong on Friday amen we're to stay separated from the things of the world and consecrate it to the word of God amen let's look at James chapter one verse 27 foreign and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world this is part of pure religion and undefiled let's go back to First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 9. this is the Apostle Paul speaking First Corinthians 9 and verse 24. know you not the day which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain now I want to stop there because we always go on but what does Paul saying he's saying you should give your all that's what he's saying many people run in a race they all run but only one person gets the prize you should run this race of life so that you get the prize if only one person's getting the prize it's got to be me Paul is saying give all don't halfway don't hold back Paul is telling us to give all verse 25 and every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore shall run not as uncertain so fight I not as one that beat at the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway the Apostle Paul he's he's not saying well I'm born again filled with the Holy Ghost been Sanctified by God no he's constantly bringing this body subject to the word he's watching after his life he's watching after his conduct he's not letting this body get away from him I mean what instruction for us sanctification is not just something that happened Amen to us in our journey to the new birth but sanctification is something that's still happening to us as we sanctify our consecrate or dedicate ourselves to the purpose God has God had a purpose for Paul and Paul was not going to let his body lead him astray but to keep under your body means to beat black and blue he was keeping himself subject to the word he had choices to make he had work to do he had a part to play in this and if it was true for Paul and we're not free from that amen let's go to first Thessalonians chapter 4. first Thessalonians chapter 4. verse 1. furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as ye have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God so you would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication this word sanctification is the third one on a list here it's Consecration and purification for this is the will of God even your Consecration and purification that's continuing on that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor same word consecration purification not in the lust of concupiscence even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified for God hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness this word Holiness is the same one that was used sanctification twice in this he's called us into Consecration and purification he's called us to Walk This Way he's called us to live this way not once but for life praise God now let's go to Colossians chapter 3. I have several other scriptures but this is the last one that I'm going to read tonight Colossians chapter 3 verse 1. if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above not on things on the Earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God says in the message um that a hidden life with Christ from 1956. he says this he says Christianity is a sacrifice life a hidden life with God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost that's what the real Christian Life consists of not of how well you can do this or how well you can sing that's all right how well you can preach that's fine but that isn't it it's a hidden life consecrated the veil curtains dropped around you and you're dead and you're buried and you're hidden God through Christ and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost I I preached everything I preached because I want to get to this so just for the next few minutes I want to talk about this you see the the problem with the old understanding of Holiness of somehow doing everything right to achieve something it's totally wrong amen we only achieve what God's called us to God but we're holy because God chose us to be holy but he's told us to stay in sanctification for his purpose but but there's a motivation I should say it this way there's a motivation that comes from consecration there's a motivation that's behind our sanctification and the motivation comes from the hidden life in Christ like I can I can preach oh I hope I can express this right just pull for a minute please I can preach in a way a condemning way and if I preach hard enough and I preach and I hit enough points I can hit enough points to where I can make everybody in here feel condemned if I just talk about life talk about things that you've seen this week and things you've heard and something you should have turned away from you didn't turn away fast enough and I thought you had about another person I mean how many of us could raise our hands now that we're toast amen we could just start laying it out and laying it out and say you have to stop those things you have to change that God doesn't want that but you already know that is that right so the motivation cannot be stop doing that God doesn't want you to do that that can't be just a motivation alone I mean there has to be a deeper motivation that comes from a deep reality of the word and it comes from a relationship that takes place behind the veil not on the surface level not something that takes place amen because you know I want to be a good boy and I want to make it to Heaven there needs to be a deeper Revelation or else we'll never make it amen because we we've got to come a little higher in our Revelation or else we're going to find ourselves constantly falling constantly falling constantly falling and like never able to achieve that which we're going after but we're going after the wrong thing the wrong way amen what God wants from us is to draw us to himself he's looking for us to enter in behind the veil amen and become one with him and when we come into that Unity with him a bridegroom and a bride amen then all of a sudden there is no desire in you that wants to displease the bridegroom it's the hidden life that calls for consecration I read all the scriptures to you to show that this is part of life this is what we're called to this is absolutely what God wants from us he wants us to stay separate he wants us to be consecrated he wants us to stay in sanctification he wants us separated from the world and consecrated to his purpose but if I just tell you that and you try to do that if that's the only motivation you're going to be a frustrated person but what you must do first is enter in behind the veil and recognize who's calling who's drawing amen that you've come into one with Christ and then after that he's revealed Who You Are he himself has called you bride not a preacher behind the pulpit but he himself has called you bride he has unveiled himself to you not an intellectual teaching not an ability to show quotes and show scriptures but Christ himself has revealed himself to you and when you've entered into that relationship behind the veil now all of a sudden it's not because Paul said it that I do it Paul was showing what God wants out of my life but it's not Paul saying it that makes me want to do it it's the hidden life with Christ that's motivating me to give my all they understand this is why amen when when we try to hammer somebody into confirmation we can get people to conform in a certain way in a certain group setting amen but it's never ever coming from the depth of their soul amen so it'll never last the only thing that will last is what's coming from the depth of your soul and that's coming from the hidden life with Christ it's coming because we've entered in behind the veil we've become one amen and where did we enter in behind the veil when he came in amen when we were when our soul was regenerate purged and that seed come to life now he is dwelling within and we are communing with God and all of a sudden I realize who I am not because somebody told me but he told me I know who he is and I know who I am and all of a sudden all I want to do is give myself to him you see it's the only thing that will work he he has Sanctified Us by his Spirit he has filled us he's burnt out the worldly Nature by the Holy Ghost he's come to take residence in US amen so that we will stay consecrated to him amen not because we have to but because we want to I I grew up and oh I grew up in all kinds of preaching friends news meetings and all kinds of gatherings I hit the altar every time the evangelists started naming bad things in your life because it was there what other choice did I have but it was this Revelation that was contained in the seals that that unsealed who I am there was the Revelation under the seals that unsealed who I am I knew God was holy but I didn't realize that I was supposed to be holy I I knew he was holy but I didn't realize he wanted me to be holy because he wanted to be he wanted me to be the Tabernacle that was going to be Tabernacle deity in this day and when I come to realize what God wanted to do in this generation that he wanted the deity to be tabernacled and flashed and that he wanted my flesh to be part of that Tabernacle all of a sudden everything in my life changed it wasn't anymore I have to be a good boy to make it to Heaven I realize I've already made it I made it before the foundation of the world when he placed my name on The Book of Life amen before it was there I was in his thoughts I was always with God and always a part of God I'm not in jeopardy of being lost I'm not conducting myself in a way to be saved I recognize I'm saved I'm conducting myself in a way to keep myself in his purpose [Music] because I recognize his purpose in my life I won't join in in the things of the world not because I'm going to be punished not because lightning bolts are going to hit me or because the rest of the church will reject me I I know what he wants me to do and now that's what I'm consecrating myself for I know who I am I know my purpose in life I know the light that's supposed to shine from this vessel now I sanctify myself for their sakes amen because they're not going to find him in a system they're not going to find him in Hollywood they're not going to find him in Pleasures the world where will they find him he'll find him in the word that's coming forth from this bride she's the final voice and the final age how can I now live an unconsecrated life where somebody won't hear the voice of God you understand going behind the veil changes everything entering the little room amen having him unveil himself to you it changes everything amen now now why do you consecrate yourself because I know who I am because it's so important amen because of who I rub shoulders with because who I'm in contact with because of who I am and because of who's in me now I must keep the lamp the glass that's over the line I must keep it clean so the light can shine out I don't have to keep it clean so that I can receive the light does that make sense the light is in me Jesus said I'm the light of the world Amen but then he looked at disciple says you're the light of the world where's the light he's the light the word may manifest in your day is light where's the word made manifest in me the light is in me I'm not trying to receive the light I've received the light now for me I'm supposed to be a vessel that's shining the light so what am I to do I'm to keep that glass clean which is this body so that the light can shine out if I let it get smutted up with the world and ruin my testimony into stand and compromise who's going to receive this light amen they look at a vessel that's tainted and dirty and smudge and now the light is all obscure and dark and there's no clear resonating of the Life of Christ amen what I've done is I've robbed this world from a clear sign but now the Revelation from behind the veil has put in me a desire for sanctification [Music] now I have to do this and I have to do that I can say what brother Brandon said I can go on the bank of the river and fish every day of my life and be just as saved and go to heaven and be in the new heavens and the new Earth that's not his purpose for me that's not what he wants for me and so now I sanctify myself to this purpose you see friends the Revelation changes everything amen every teaching every principle everything changes with the revelation brother Branham said in Revelation chapter 4. part three from 1961 he says all right here was voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives that's what he's telling us that's the voice of God thundering out is our life sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God amen I'm going to read that again because I like it so much amen there there's all kinds of demonstrations that take place on Sunday amen but that's not what scares the devil amen it's how you live on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday that's what shakes the devil we can we can raise hands and sing and demonstrate in Hallelujah and shake hands and hug next amen that doesn't bother the devil he knows that can be a church walk but what what really terrifies him is somebody that'll stay consecrated to their purpose and say Sanctified to the purpose that God has in their life and fulfill that purpose amen was the devil constantly trying to do trying to keep you from your purpose what is he trying to he's trying to do this and he's trying to do that he's trying all kinds of things in my life really he's got one main objective and that one main objective is to keep you from your purpose praise God I'm going to read this again the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't worry how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God you say that's what God does God does it and you do it say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil I don't know about you but I want to shake the devil and I don't need to scream at him to shake him but what I need to do is surrender surrender with everything that's in me to this revealed word I give all of my life and surrender to this word and Obey it with all with all that's in my heart to yield my members not unto righteousness but unto righteousness to surrender myself to God to surrender myself to his word to his Spirit that's flowing amen not to take my own ideas about things and not to have my own wants and desires about things around me but to completely surrender to this word amen then when I Surrender and then I live that life it is not me you realize he said brother Madam said it's not you it's a life that he lives through you amen but he lives it through you as you surrender as you yield as you lay down your life and let him live his life we can hinder that by living our own life and making our own choices but or we can consecrate ourselves we can sanctify ourselves dedicating ourselves to his purpose and let him Shine the Light through us when brother man says it's the Thunder of God thundering out and sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled Life that's not a man trying to be nice that's the life of Christ living through a human being it's not just you deciding I want to be nice to everybody no it's got to be Christ Living Through you but we must be surrendered to that for Christ to live through us it's not a code of conduct not a moral order it's not a social Gathering or a group it's a consecrated life to God Alone a life lived for him the word separation I wrote down here separation from anything contrary to him say God help us to live that life we'll never do it on our own we can't purify ourselves we can't cleanse ourselves from unrights it's got to be him doing it but he's asked us to consecrate ourselves to that purpose Paul taught us to keep under Paul got us by keeping under his body and bringing his subject he told us to to live a clean life to separate from the world not to be partakers of these things that's something we can do that's considered our reasonable service but all of my efforts will produce no life he must produce the life all of my efforts is just to stay lined up to his purpose and to to choose to surrender to his will and to his word amen let's all stand musicians if you'll please come amen what can we do can we cleanse ourselves no can we purify ourselves no but what can we do in consecrating ourselves we can choose to be set apart separated from the things of the world you know we choose what we see we choose what we hear we choose where we associate we make those choices we can choose to deny ourselves and surrender to the word we can say Lord that's nothing but the truth amen you know brother Brown was asked by a man one time in questions and answers I I haven't read it recently so I may not have it exactly right but said brother random I'm bothered with this temper how do I get rid of this temper you've heard it so many times brother bam says just stop it what do I do stop it you just stop doing it and you think uh there's so many things that that we want God to just do for us but God's saying do it I mean bring your body subject just choose the word amen he'll Supply the rest but just surrender he'll Supply the rest we must stay surrendered what else can we do Reserve ourselves only for his purpose we can get caught up in all kinds of hobbies friendships careers we can get caught up in all kinds of things that will begin to take us away from his purpose we must recognize that even sometimes what seems like a blessing may not be a blessing we can have a career that takes us away from fellowship we can have a career that would want to move us away from a church we can have associations and we can have hobbies we can have things that move us away from God's purpose in our life and we must be aware of those things and not just give ourselves holy to that if there's anything that takes me away from God's purpose God please help me to lay it down stay consecrated for this purpose for this is why I'm on this Earth that includes where you work and where you live and what family you're in but your purpose is to shine forth his life coming through your flesh and I want to stay Sanctified to that amen let's bow our heads in prayer dear Lord Jesus I thank you God for your word Lord I Thank you for this message that you've sent to us God I pray that you would take the true intention of what I preached Lord what you laid on my heart place it deep in the heart of your children Lord that we would go beyond all humanistic ideas and go beyond all these ideas of attaining to something becoming something Lord that we would just recognize Lord what you're calling for in our lives and may you by your grace give us the ability to surrender Lord help us God to stay surrendered God while the word was being preached tonight God if your children recognized places in their lives where they need to be consecrated I pray you'd give them the strength to make those choices they need to make to surrender to what you're calling for God if there's anywhere in our lives Lord that we're we're we're being distracted from your purpose forgive us Lord and give us the strength to move back in line with your purpose open our eyes to see what it is you want in this day help us God let your spirit move on us Lord and give us the strength to stay consecrated to this purpose God we want to choose your way we want to choose your will oh we want to sanctify ourselves for our neighbors for our co-workers for our family members help us God God I thank you Lord if there's not if there's one here who's not entered in behind the veil that you've not made yourself uh real to them that they haven't seen yet who they are God I pray that you would unveil yourself to them and a very unique and special way Lord that they would know that they've come in contact with the Living God I pray you do a work in each life Lord that we would each Lord go Beyond the Veil to our Lord is not anymore do's and don'ts it's not anymore or the law it's not anymore an obligation but it's become a life Lord It's become the desire of our heart it's become the pleasure of our life to serve you and to please you God help us to move away from religious Notions help us to move away from social constraints help us to move away from group thinking Lord God help us to recognize our individual calling our individual relationship and our individual responsibility help us Lord each one consecrate ourselves to you Lord take me use me God for your purpose and remove from me anything that would be contrary God I love you with all of my heart Lord thank you for the work you've done in my life and I realize Lord I need more I pray you keep pouring your water Upon Us Lord that you might keep washing us away and sanctifying us from these things we might stay true to you and to you alone I Love You Lord and I ask your blessings over all your people in Jesus Christ's name we pray oh may God move us may God move us away from religion may God move us away from group thinking may God take each one of us behind the veil and may He unveil himself to us personally so that now amen now my life is lived for him not for not not for whatever everybody around me thinks but there's one you remember when brother Branham he told the story of the of the of the man who was playing I believe it was a violin piece and he played in a great Orchestra Hong there was hundreds maybe thousands of people there and he played and he played a masterful way he did it perfect and and when he was done there was a standing ovation and everybody was cheering and applauding but he didn't look to the people he looked to the balcony because in the balcony was the master who had taught him and he wasn't satisfied till the master was satisfied listen you may have tons of people who think you're wonderful and people who Pat you on the back and sing your Praises but there's really only one that we want to please amen and that's the master that's the one who we met behind the veil that's one that we're in a hidden life relationship with he's my bridegroom amen he may be yours too but that's not what I'm worried about I'm worried about him being my bridegroom amen and I'm his bride you may be too but what I what matters to me is that he's my bridegroom what changes my life is not your relationship with him but what changes my life is my relationship with him we can keep things in general terms we're all the bride he's the bridegroom we're the bride that doesn't change your life what changes your life is when he's your bridegroom and when you're his bride and when you've met him behind the veil then all of a sudden to me it's inconsequential of whether this is accepted or not accepted by the people I felt with it's inconsequential now to me as long as it's accepted by him that's what I'm after as long as I can surrender to his will and be pleasing to him that becomes the most important thing in our lives and that's what we're consecrating ourselves to that's what we're
