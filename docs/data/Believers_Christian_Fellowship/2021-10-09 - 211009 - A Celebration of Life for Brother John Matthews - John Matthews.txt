come in one morning and sat down and you have to understand that my middle name's john math is matthew so i'm john matthew and my my dad's name's john so everybody called me john matthew growing up and and so brother josh said brother john matthew's house burned down this morning and we were sitting in service and my wife and i both kind of started and looked at one another we didn't know there was a brother john matthews and so we quickly learned who brother john matthews was and but we appreciate brother john and you know one thing i always enjoyed about brother john was being with him when he was witnessing which was pretty much any time you're with brother john so he was always sharing the word and it was just part of him and that gift that was in his life he could just talk to anyone and uh just so much appreciated our brother and all that god did through his life and know that he's rejoicing with sister wilma again and know she's happy and and just appreciate all that god

to break the word open for us to give us an assurance that one day we're going to see our brother john again amen standing on the other side amen we're looking for that great day amen and we can be joined together once again amen let's just sing this song as where the chad gets ready to come no one like jesus amen there's no one like jesus amen not the jesus of 2000 years ago but the one that's living in my heart that's changed my life from the wretch that i was changed our brother amen from just a a person walking living in a life to one that was totally transformed and changed amen oh there's no one there's no one like jesus [Music] oh there's no one no one like jesus would die for me just to set my spirit free oh there's no one there's no one like let's sing that again [Music] [Music] [Music] me amen god bless you this morning it's good to see you all it certainly sounds like a celebration of life so far we appreciate god for that while we're standing let's just take our bibles and turn to a scripture and then we'll let everybody be seated if you have your bibles i'll read it here out of second timothy chapter 4 verse 6. for i am now ready to be offered in the time of my departures at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing amen our brother loved his appearing i praise god for that and i thank god that he finished his course and that he kept the faith and now it's our turn to finish our course and to keep the faith what an example that the brother set before us and i want to talk about that and preach the word a little bit and then just remember his life but let's pray before we're seated lord jesus we thank you for the privilege of gathering together of remembering lord the light that you shine through a life here on earth through our brother john and all that you did lord through him and each one of us in some way or another were able to be affected by his life to spend some time on this earth in this dimension together and for that we're grateful lord and we want to say thank you for the privilege lord for we consider it a privilege and lord you've chose to take our brother home and for that we're thankful lord we rejoice in his reward and we ask lord that you would help us today as we look at your word in honor of our brother god that you would bless the breaking of bread lord that you would break it by your own hand that you would feed us the sheep that remain to keep strength lord in our bodies that we might serve you to continue on carrying that light that our brother carried we ask for your blessing and all things we say and do in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated it's good to see you all not everybody had the opportunity or actually very few had the opportunity to be at the funeral because of the uh restrictions and the circumstances so this is an opportunity for those that worshipped with brother john and fellowship with him to be able to gather together to remember his life and brother josh said we want we want some preaching because that's what brother john loved he loved the preaching of the word and i remember you know i think of him often still and he sat right back here in the back and he would he would he'd be nodding away the brother he would nod raise his hands every once in a while but when it really was good he would pump that fist oh that's what i looked for you know when he would do like that i was like praise god amen we said something we're saying and so i i missed that i missed out about the brother and brother john absolutely loved the word of god amen it wasn't his pastime it was his life amen it wasn't to him about church attendance he came to church because that's what believers do but the word was his whole life amen once he once once god had got a hold of him and directed him and he found christ for our day he never let loose amen well i just appreciated that about the brother and you know there were some things i shared with the funeral i'd like to share again today for all those who remember him but but he would challenge me in the word and he would challenge me in all kinds of things but you know i knew that that brother john put the word above everything else and if you were close to him you knew he put the word above everything else even above family and above relationships he put the word first and that's what i loved about him i knew that if i ever left the word he'd walk out the doors of this church and not come back and i loved that about him and i knew that he put the word first and and i liked it and so i enjoyed our fellowship he loved the fellowship brother john loved to sit and talk about the word amen he loved to talk about the things god were doing the things he was seeing modern events current events and prophecy being fulfilled he loved all of those things and i would i would meet him after church he'd be waiting for me out one of these doors and he would catch me and he'd be standing there he goes did you did you watch the news yesterday i said no i didn't watch the news yesterday did you hear what the pope said no i didn't hear so he would fill me in and then he'd go to the message and he'd go to prophecy and i say praise the lord brother he goes what do you think i said i don't know i just heard it i mean give me give me a minute to process amen but but that's what he was always looking for was the word to be fulfilled he was watching all the time for the things that were promised in this end time to manifest themselves and he was a tremendous brother and like was said before he was a tremendous witnesser he he could talk to anybody and to everybody and i've shared this story with a few people but i'd like to share it again i i was talking to brother john one day and he was just telling me he had these little hitchhiker cards this thing that the lord had inspired him to write and he made a track out of it he had little cards he would pass that all the time and he was telling me that he was at the gas station and he was pumping gas and somebody pulled in to the gas pump you know on the other side of the one he was at and he struck up a conversation i think it was a man or a lady i don't remember now and he started talking to them started talking about the lord he gave him a hitchhiker card he witnessed to them uh convinced them to give their heart back to the lord i think it was he got their name and their phone number so he could call and follow up with them and they finally finished 20 or 30 minutes later and he drove away i thought man the brother is good so like the next week i think it was sometime i'm pumping gas and somebody pulls up and the pump across from me and they get out there pumping gas and i remember the story and i and i looked over at them i looked over the person they looked at me and i kind of nodded and they kind of nod and they turned to pump gas and i was thinking about what brother john did and i thought never mind it doesn't work for me i just kept pumping gas never said a word and got in my truck and left if you've got the gift you have the gift if you don't have the gift you can't manufacture the gift he had it brother and he was a witnessing machine and god used him mightily for that amen just to encourage people along their walk to take him another step higher amen to encourage them in the ways of the lord he would pray with people he would pray for people he wouldn't even invite people to church he would just share sometimes just a scripture and encourage somebody to do better whatever he could do he did however far he could take he took and then and he wasn't worried about the rest he left that to god but i i appreciate that so he was definitely a challenge to me god didn't give us the same gift and i tried to emulate and i failed but i just pray god will help me when he wants to use me amen i'd like to take a look at matthew 13 and i'll just read it here there's a couple scriptures i want to look at matthew 13 and 44 it says again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field again the kingdom of heaven is likened to a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it this to me is a reflection of our brother's life for when he found christ in his day he found the message of the hour that was it for him everything else was given up and you know brother john may not have had to physically go sell property or go get money out of the bank and buy a piece of ground or sell everything for a physical pearl that's not what the lord is talking about but when he found the treasure when he found the thing that he valued the most what he had been looking for all his life when he found it that was it amen nothing else mattered he had to have it if it meant selling out to everything else he sold out everything else because he had to have this i remember you know talking to him and talking to our brother gene petrie you know brother gene needed some bulldozer work done and he got a name of a of an individual who would do some work for him on his farm and that name was john matthews i believe it was in the 70s if i'm not wrong sometime along then and and john come out to do some bulldozer work on brother gene petrie's farm and and he was moving some trees and cutting some lanes and and brother gene has a way of just asking questions if you've ever been asked a question by brother gene he has a way of asking a question and he'll ask a question that'll totally pop your mind and open to a thing you've never thought of before about the word and about the lord and he began to ask questions and and they started this dialogue and in the dialogue he would begin john would begin to share things out of scripture and pretty soon john couldn't take it anymore he had to know how do you get all this where does it come from how do you know this and he just shared with him that god had sent a prophet in the end time and there was a message and that message was christ and when he found that that had been the thing he was looking for all his life he may not have been able to put it into words he may not have been able to verbalize what his desire was of his heart all his life what the tug was what the draw was he may not have been able to explain i'm looking for christ in my day i'm looking for the manifestation of the word today but there was something in him that was longing searching and and he he wasn't satisfied with one church he i think he tried them all is that right i think he tried several so he he couldn't find what it was he was looking for so he tried one for a while and he would try another and he would try another but during these conversations with brother gene all of a sudden something began to stir and he was pointed towards christ amen and when when he saw what it was that was the treasure hidden in the field for our brother john that was the pearl of great price that he was looking for and he was willing to give everything up and now when we look back and reflect on the life of our brother john we're not sitting here talking about accommodations that he received for merits of honor and a public service we're not talking about accomplishments he made in a in a civil job or the amount of money he earned when we all talk about brother john there's one thing that stands out the thing he loved most was this word everything he else he did was on the side this was the main thing he worked he had to work he had to support himself he had to have a job you know he did things he had interest in life he had family and he loved them dearly he had things that he were interested in things that he enjoyed but we all know what was the main attraction for brother john and the main attraction was the word and i said let that be an example to us if there was ever anybody we saw sell everything and with joy not sell everything and be like oh i just can't go there no i can't do this i have to no way when he come into the truth when he recognized amen that the word had been restored to the church amen there was nothing else he wanted in comparison for this everything else in the exchange rate of value everything else was less value than this so in the exchange rate of value you know when there's an exchange rate of something it's what you're willing to pay for it so you're willing to part with money to have an item so if you go to a garage sale and you say this item is worth this much to me i'm willing to pay this to have that item it's an exchange rate of value and somebody else might not give what you would give for it or you may not give what somebody else would give for it but there's an exchange rate of value but when brother john come in contact with christ for our day the exchange rate of value was so superior he would give everything to have this he would give work he would give relationships he would give friendships he would give up everything for christ i said let that be our example amen i i i hope that i don't come to the end of my life and everybody tried to conjure up some earthly accomplishments to talk about at my funeral well he he worked at a certain certain job for so many years and he left behind such such amount of money and he got you know i would hate it if they were standing at my funeral saying he had perfect attendance you know he outsold everybody else he was the top salesman three years in a row well that's fine thank god for that that's a blessing but that's not what i want at my funeral i want to be known for selling out for the word amen i want to be known for giving everything the exchange rate of christ in my life that everybody knows what the value of the word was for me that everybody knows that he was willing to exchange friendships he was willing to exchange relationships he was really to exchange jobs he was willing to exchange everything for the value of christ that was the pearl of great price luke 17 jesus is going to say something that could be astonishing luke 17 verse 20 says and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you before he said when the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field that when a man finds it he hides and goes and sells all he had to buy the field to have the treasure when he finds the the the kingdom of heaven is like a pearl hidden in a field so he's talking about this same kingdom and this kingdom is it's like a treasure hit in the field it's like a pearl but he comes here to luke he says the kingdom of heaven is within you so this thing oh praise god what brother john matthews realized is the thing that he'd been looking for all his life was in him he was looking for god and not realizing he was carrying an attribute of god around this earth that way down in the soul there was something laying there waiting to be struck with light and be struck with water amen to come to a birth to come into manifestation and he didn't realize the thing he was looking for amen the field it was hidden was him amen the pearl of great price was down in his soul and he didn't know it it was buried over by the dirt of the earth it was buried over by amen by corruption and by a corruptable spirit but a spirit of the earth a carnal spirit it was buried it was there but the real treasure he found amen was that there was something that god had planted in him before the foundation of the world and only god knew how to wake it up amen only god knew how to make it active and he would have to take this part of the word that's predestinated for this hour and he would have to match it with a word that was ordained for this hour and when the word for this hour matched a seed for this hour and the two came together there was a new birth and it sprung to life and we all saw that there was a change that there was a new birth you could tell this is a manifested son of god he paid the the price of exchange he gave it all for the word matthew 18 verse 3 says verily i say unto you except you be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as a little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven in order order for this the entrance into this kingdom we must be converted and become like a little child we must become like a child of the kingdom one that will just believe his father's word one that will just take for face value what father says like a child that will believe amen not have to reason a child doesn't have to reason a child believes a child doesn't have to know all the science behind something they just know a father says it it's true and we must be converted and become as a little child and you know brother john was able he had been through so many different realms of theology so many different flavors of christianity amen but when he when he came to this one that would awaken amen the kingdom within him the one that would that would that would bring him into his rightful position the one that would reveal to him the treasure that he's been looking for all of his life he had to become like a child so simple that he could believe it in a simple way so simple that he could believe a simple message and believe the scriptures just as they're written amen he would have to be converted and he'd have to be able to forget all of his theology and forget all of his training and of all of his former understanding but he'd have to be converted and come back to being a child of the kingdom one that would just believe what the father says in the smyrnan church age the prophet of god says the son of god can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son in fact a lot of true christians are like the story of the baby eagle that was hatched out under a hand you know that eagle is a type of the true believer well a farmer took an egg from an eagle's nest and he placed it under a hen in due time all the eggs under the hen hatched out the baby chicks got along fine with the mother hen but the little eagle could not figure out the clucking and scratching for food in the manure pile he managed to make a living but he was pretty confused about it all but one day from way up in the air the mother eagle that had laid the egg spied that little egg on the ground she swooped down with tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up to meet her he had never heard an eagle cry but when he heard that first scream something in him stirred he longed to launch out toward it but he was afraid to try again that mother screamed for him to arise in the wind and follow her he screamed back that he was afraid once more she cried out screamed that he tried beating his wings he hurled himself into the air and answered the cry of his mother he soared off into the blue skies you see he always was an eagle he acted like a chicken for a little while but he could not be satisfied but when he heard the call of the great eagle he came to his own place and once a true son of god hears the cry of the spirit by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in heavenly places in christ jesus how many believe brother john heard an eagle scream and he heard that eagle scream and he had never heard it just that way before he had heard bible verses read had heard sermons but they never heard that certain sound amen that certain sound through the word that certain sound through the scripture remember when he heard that certain sound amen there was a reason the analogy that the prophet's using is an eagle in the chicken yard amen they're all birds but this bird is different than the other birds he's a misfit to the birds and all he knows to do because of what he was hatched under was the emulate to act like what he sees amen but they're coming day that he hears something he's never heard before but when he hears it although the other chickens run away in terror there's one little chicken down there that didn't know he really wasn't a chicken but he heard something that sounded good to him it didn't sound good to anybody else but it sounded good to him and when it sounded it somehow in an odd way though he had never heard it before it sounded familiar isn't that amazing there was something there's a screen that screamed out but there was an echo inside of him somehow he knew that whatever that was i am amen that scream is inside of me that flying thing is in me it's all here i didn't know it before but it's like i always knew it but i know i didn't know it but i know it. amen because when a child of god hears the word amen that come from god where did the child of god come from come from god where did the word come from it come from god they are the same thing a child of god is the word amen when the word comes to the word when they unite they recognize one another [Music] so a child of god come from god the word of god come from god so when the word of god comes to a child of god now i'm not talking about a word of god that's been polluted and diced up and pulled apart and theologically trained and all the meanings gone out of it but when the real word of god amen and all of its power and the originality with which he brought it amen with the original thought and tint with the word when that comes to the ears of a child of god amen is the eagle screaming and something inside of him says what is that i have never heard the gospel that way before i have never shared the scriptures that way before amen then a child of god says that is who i am i still may be far away from where that is but that's who i am and the eagle scream kept drawing and drawing until the ego had enough courage to start flapping the wings and start lifting off the earth and and we know the first landing place was the post and the chicken yard but that wasn't high enough yet kept flapping and before too long the eagle was flying in the same realm that the eagle scream came from because that's where it was ordained to be in the book of jeremiah god is speaking to jeremiah the prophet in chapter one he says then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou cometh forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations so before before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee that's amazing god had four knowledge and he's sharing with jeremiah jeremiah has a commission and the commission on earth is difficult for jeremiah to perform so for god in order to get jeremiah in position and get jeremiah to do what jeremiah needs to do god is going to have to break a seal of understanding to jeremiah and open up his understanding to a higher level and say listen jeremiah before you were formed in the belly i knew you and before you come us forth from the womb i sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations what did jeremiah have to do with that he had nothing to do with that that was god's will that was god's purpose for his life so in order for jeremiah to go and be the voice of the lord in that day to cry against all the evils in jerusalem to be the one who's bringing the word for his day god had to open up a level of understanding that would give jeremiah the courage to take his god-given position and god has done the same thing for us in this day he has peeled back a seal of understanding so that we can see that before i was formed in the belly he knew me before i came forth he sanctified and ordained me amen to do what i'm doing today he ordained our brother john our brother john didn't wake up one day and said i'm going to be the best witness or the message has ever seen it was already in him god foresaw it before the foundation of the world but god opened a seal of understanding so that brother john could step into the role that god had ordained him to be in he brought him the message to take him back so he could understand i come from the mind of god god thought of me and he foresaw me and he knew me here and it gave him the courage to move forward and be what he was ordained to be it was god's calling it was god's wish it was god's desire what we saw in the life of our brother john is what god foresaw it wasn't john's desire to be the way he was he was the way he was by design that's why brother john could strike up a conversation with somebody in the opposite gas pump have them weeping and praying at the bumper of their vehicle and i look over there and nothing i can't get my feet to move i can't get my mouth open amen he was what he was by the will of god by the purpose that god had purposed for him and we are the same i'd like to look at a story out of luke chapter seven if i can luke chapter seven we know the story really well but i'd like to like to look at it together in this context luke 7 and 36 and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and then wiped them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed him with the ointment now when the pharisees which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner and jesus answered and said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he said master say on so there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one which owed five thousand pence and the other fifty when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thine house thou gaves me no water for thy feet but she had washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gave me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou does not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven i don't remember her asking him to forgive her sins but jesus knew what she had need of and when she recognized christ in her day and she gave everything to him jesus turned to the woman who hadn't asked yet and said thy sins are all forgiven she recognized what the pharisee missed she caught the mystery the secret of who this was sitting at this table when simon gave him no welcome what was jesus he was the word made flesh he was the anointed word of god for that day and he was in their presence and they missed it and the pharisee who should have known didn't know and the pharisee who is now judging and becoming critical and and jesus now is teaching a valuable lesson this woman because there was something in her could recognize the value of this man the importance of this man simon didn't recognize it and simon showed him a great disservice and a dishonor by not welcoming him with a kiss by not anointing him and not washing his feet he did not bid him welcome he invited him but didn't bid him welcome jesus come according to the invitation but simon didn't honor he didn't value this one who had come but this woman though she was a sinner she put great value on the one that was sitting at simon's table and she bust her way in and took a amen she took a an alabaster box full of ointment another scripture says very precious amen of much worth and she breaks it amen and what she was doing is she was giving all that she had amen to this one that was sitting at the table that was unrecognized by the masses but there was a little sinner woman who had caught the value of this person because this is the word of god made manifest this is god in our day and she took the most valuable things she had and she ran in there in front of everybody who would scorn her and ridicule they all knew she was a sinner and she ran in there because the value of the person who was present was worth the ridicule and scorn and judgment and critical attitudes and critical statements it was worth her breaking the alabaster box and listen friends she didn't open the alabaster box and get a little out and sprinkle it on his feet there was no going back there was no reserve she didn't even tip it over to give a little pour out of the corner she broke the alabaster box this was a point of no return she could not recollect this valuable ointment but she saw the exchange rate as more than worth it amen this one sitting here is well worth more worthy than this box of ointment is and she took the most valuable things she had she took everything and she threw it down and broke it at his feet anointed his feet kissed his feet wept and washed his feet with her tears and wiped him with her hair and when she did this to the word made manifest in her day the word in her day said your sins are forgiven the next verse says and they that sat at me with him begin to say within themselves who is this that forgive us sins and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace she didn't say anything we have no record she said anything she couldn't have expressed her faith in words she expressed her faith in action she gave everything for this one sitting at the table i said god help us help us how many times in our lives have we tried to dip a little bit out of our box our alabaster box that we recognize this is a valuable person we recognize this as christ at our midst but i want to dip just i you know i don't want to go all the way i'll dip out of my louder bastard because that's good it's the same ointment it's precious ointment or how many times we do a little more maybe pour out of the corner just a little just tip it up and we'll give him a little more maybe than the next person gave but this woman gave everything she broke her alabaster box when she left there she was going to have none of that ointment she was going to have nothing all that she had saved for all that she was hoping would be her redemption and get her out of this life of sin that she was in she had all saved it up amen and all the money that she had and everything she saved that was going to be her own redemption out of her life of sin she gave it amen and sold out to buy the ointment in the alabaster box and then she took that which was her whole hope for redemption everything that she could do herself to free her from a life of sin she took that and she broke it at his feet there was no other option there was no plan b there was no going back it was all or nothing she broke it all and gave it all to him and what did she walk away from she walked away with more than anybody else could have ever given her she left the scene so much better off than simon the pharisee better often the high priest amen in jerusalem at the temple better off amen than the wealthiest among them in the temple amen she left there better often them all because all her sins were forgiven praise god paul said one time philippians he said though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath aware of he might trust in the flesh i more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law of pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those i counted loss for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i might win christ and being found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith oh paul found what that woman found paul found what our brother john found or maybe john found what paul found who came first but what he found in the exchange of value when he would value it paul the apostle who had everything going for him he had a reputation among the elders and the chief priests he had the best schooling that there was in the school of gamalio he had a reputation where they would trust him and they would give him letters that he could go into damascus to bring christians and and bound into prison and return him to jerusalem he was he had everything that he wanted going for him but when he met the pillar of fire on the road to damascus he actually found the thing that he really wanted he was zealous over the religion of his fathers because he didn't know anything else amen but he was zealous because he wanted god he was zealous because he wanted to be he wanted to be found of god in the faith he wanted to please god he wanted to find god and he was doing everything that he knew how to do but when he met the pillar of fire he finally found the thing that he was actually looking for and the thing the only thing that would actually survive supply amen would actually be sufficient for meeting the need that was within him for what he was actually looking for was in that pillar of fire and when he met the pillar of fire what was it it was jesus christ but not jesus christ amen the body that the nail pierced hands he had returned back to the pillar of fire he was now in the form of spirit and he was speaking to him and who was it it was none other than jesus christ and jesus said why do you persecute me now you know and the apostle paul didn't see a physical outline of a person he saw a light and that light said why do you persecute me and we have no record that that the apostle paul ever did anything to the physical body of jesus christ before the crucifixion [Music] but we know that when he persecuted the church because by the baptism of the holy ghost at pentecost the church had become the body of jesus christ and when he persecuted the church paul didn't recognize who was in these people he didn't recognize amen i'm zealous to stop the people but what they have is what i need what they have is what i want so god in his grace and mercy he stops him by a pillar of fire and he tells him why are you persecuting me he was persecuting the church which is him his tabernacle his dwelling place see we know by the scriptures that christ has been moving through the entire bible age by age dispensation by dispensation the scriptures tell us that pharaoh he refused to be called the the son of pharaoh's daughter amen forsaking the riches of egypt for the reproach of christ so that means christ was there in moses's day he could bear the reproach of christ we know also hebrews tells us amen that they did all drink from that spiritual rock and that rock was christ so in the wilderness there was christ so that means through this whole bible as the word is coming into manifestation what was in god's mind as it becomes materialized and in manifestation it's christ it's christ there it's christ here it's christ here it's christ here and everybody is receiving salvation based off how they deal with christ when when they drank from that spiritual rock that rock was christ amen what was it doing it was providing salvation for them they were going to die amen from dehydration but god christ was smitten and christ opened up and christ gave the water of life and they drank and they survived so in every age and every dispensation there was christ because christ is the anointed word the word may manifest for your day that's what paul met he met jesus christ not the one not in the same form the same one but not the same form now he was persecuting christ how was he persecuting christ when he was persecuting his body because now christ was in this manifestation of the church amen that's why the bible tells us in hebrews 13 8 if you look at brother john's hat in the picture there he wore that hat everywhere he had that hat made as a witnessing tool that has started a lot of discussions and that is hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's the same jesus christ it may not be in the same form but it's the same jesus christ and he would use it as a witnessing tool to show that the christ is there is the christ the tear the christ that's always been is the christ that's here is the christ that will be forever jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and brother john was trying to introduce people to that living jesus christ where was he he was in john where was that hebrews 13 8 where was it it was in the man wearing the hat the man wearing the hat was declaring that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever well where is he look under the hat amen if you look under the hat you'll find the dwelling place of that same hebrews 13 8 jesus christ for now he's dwelling in a body of believers amen he's dwelling in his bride upon the earth amen people didn't know what they came in contact with it wasn't john the man that you could touch and shake his hand it was what was in john it was the life of christ that was in him that came to unite with that word that laid in there and sprung it to life and now was living out through brother john that was a portion of the spirit of god the portion of christ was walking around in our brother and people would come in contact with him and they didn't really know who they were coming in contact with because had they known they wouldn't have broken any alabaster boxes at john's feet but they would have broke it for the life that was in him for christ that was anointing this man to speak to them he would point them to christ and they would turn to christ and if they would recognize who this was and what manifestation we were under and where christ was and what this word was that john was giving them they would turn to christ and they would break their alabaster box and give him everything they had he had some that would and some that wouldn't here's one that would amen oh thank god for the life of a believer first corinthians 12 7 says but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for the one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will for as the body is one now he's starting to type this spiritual body of christ with your physical body for as the body is one and half many members all the members of that one body being many are one so also is christ he didn't say christ is like that he said that's what christ is he is a many-membered body all these members together amen are containing and holding the life of christ amen his life is on the earth in the vessels that he has chosen to walk in and each of these members have gifts and they differ severally as they will we've already shared with you brother john's gift and how i can't match his gift i can't even come close to matching his gift but his gift couldn't match my gift and i couldn't take his place and he couldn't take my place and i can't take your place and you can't take my place but oh praise god if brother john was here amen he would support my place and i support his place if he was here today he would back there and once or twice already he would have done that and that'd been the same as saying sickem boy and i would have went a little bit harder amen because we all have a part to play and we always want to encourage each other in our part to play and value one another and the part that we play colossians 1 26 says even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations those are the mystery that was paul was now beginning to preach that was hid in the old testament but he was going to begin speaking this mystery but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory that's the mystery that's why i could say what was under that hat the fulfillment of that hat what was under that hat a living portion of scripture that scripture living out under the hat oh how many how many simon's missed it how many sinners caught it praise god brother branham says in the message things that are to be now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of god because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life that was god there to be a son of god you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of the life that was in god as a son of god now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age what are you expressed for after this word is coming to you you're expressed to light up this age you're to be the light in this age jesus when he was here on earth he says i am the light of the world then he looks at his disciples says you are the light of the world so who's the light of the world he is well where is he when you find out where he is then you'll find out where the light is now you're expressed after his word is coming you to light up this age you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or daughter of god therefore you get what i mean see you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people in this neighborhood where you associate where wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and god before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father god just as you have with your earthly father you are citizens of the king not citizens but you are children sons and daughters of the living god if it be that eternal life dwells in you our duty is to express god to this nation this community where we live to be the light to shine the light the way our brother john shine the light we may not all shine it the same way but it's our duty to shine you know there was a bright and shining light that was coming through our brother and we enjoyed it and god's decided to take that light back home amen but there's going to be no lacking in the body there's going to be light shining in this body and god's not going to have a lack of a witness on this earth somebody else is going to have to fill that role the question is who will it be amen because there's no lack in the body every joint supplyeth if god chose to take brother john home it's because he ran his course he kept the faith he finished the work that god purposed for him to do but that job is not now going to go unfulfilled that job is going to fall on somebody else so who is it amen it's a good question only time will tell it won't be the person that says oh me me me i'll do what john did you can't unless you were born for it but the one that was born the one that was ordained amen is the one that can be anointed and the one that can be anointed it can be inspired can go forth and do as our brother den because the spirit divided severally as he will i'd like to share with you a story just as we close on a story that brother john told me and i may get some of the details messed up because you know i mess up details sometimes but the point of the story is profound to me and i wish that i had heard it again but you know how it is when somebody's sharing something with you never realized this could be the last time they ever tell me that that's the way it was with brother john but he had told me this story twice and it happened the fulfillment of it happened just about a year one to two years ago but it started many years before that and he and his wife sister wilma were in a store they were shopping and i've tried before the name the store but there's no point naming it because i can't remember but they were shopping in a store and you know as odd as it seems he would run into somebody and start a conversation and so he in his shopping cart and wilma and this other man they began a conversation and brother john said it started something like this hello how are you oh i'm fine how are you the world is sure crazy isn't it yes it is it must be the end times and brother john said end times what do you know about the end times and then he went on and on he started sharing about end time prophecy and end time revelation and they talked for some time and brother john said i asked the man his name and he says my name is nicodemus so he had a name that john was not going to forget he said my name is nicodemus and he says i'm here with my wife she's in another part of the store and they talked and he asked for john's name and no he didn't ask for john i'm sorry he didn't know john's name john asked him his name nicodemus and asked him where he worked and he said i work at a machine shop in a certain place outside of town here and john roughly knew where what area he was talking about and and he said that his name was nicodemus he said he never asked me my name and i never told him where i lived i didn't tell you anything about me i just had that much information from him we were talking about the end times he said that was it we ended the conversation he left he said as far as john remembered they just took their time going over did whatever they were doing went to checkout checked out and left and that was all he remembered of the story later he would come to find out that that man was so excited about what he was hearing and so impressed that he went to go find his wife because he wanted his wife to meet john and wilma so he went and got his wife and they come back looking for him and they could not find him he said i walked all down the aisles i walked by the checkout and i said i could not find you you were gone john didn't know this he didn't know the man looked all over for him couldn't find him and and and then the man's mind nicodemus is mine it was odd so john and wilma they go on and do what they're going to do and they and they they go on about life and that was that was it and it was many years later i don't remember the number of years but many years later after sister wilma had already passed away about one to two years ago john has a dream in the morning just before he wakes up and in the dream he walks into a machine shop he sees the machine shop he walks in the door and he asked to see nicodemus and nicodemus comes to him and nicodemus looks at him and says who are you and he says i'm john the revelator that was the part john didn't like telling before he told me that he goes now listen brother chad i'm just going to tell you what i saw in the dream i'm not making anything of it so he's a little bit bashful about that part i'm john the revelator and said then he woke up he woke up and he says i didn't know what to do so all i knew to do was try to find the machine shop so he gets out of bed he gets dressed and he drives over he said i roughly knew what area was talking about and and what on this road outside of this town he says i drove straight to the machine shop like i knew exactly where it was and i pulled him and i got out and i and i walked in and said when i walked in uh there was a young man at the at the table or the desk there he said i didn't realize it but it was nicodemus's son and nicodemus and his brother owned the machine shop he didn't know any of that at that time he says can i speak with a nicodemus does he work here and he says yes so the young man went to get him and when nicodemus walked through that door brother john says brother chad it was like he saw a ghost he just stared at me and he said who are you and brother john said i'm john the [Laughter] revelator he said i didn't know what else to do but just exactly what i saw and so he said i'm here to talk to you and share with you about the message and he said that man said listen i've got to tell you something he said last night or the night before last i can't remember which one it was i had a bible study at my church and in my bible study at the church i come to the scripture that talked about entertaining angels unawares and i told that group that isaiah and the bible say i told him all about that meeting you and what you were telling me about end time revelations and prophecies and how i went to get my wife and come and get you and you had vanished and i told them i believed you were an angel of the lord and that i entertained an angel unaware he wasn't really far from the truth because an angel is a messenger and that's why he was so stunned when the next morning or the morning after john comes walking in his door and says i'm john the revelator so they sat down there for hours they bought them lunch they had lunch together he said his wife he told him he went got his wife told his wife his wife come in she was stunned she was surprised and he got to sit and explain to them the message and share it with them had a good time and then they left and that was a year or two ago we don't know what's come of that but i just share that to show what kind of life our brother john lived and what gift was in him amen god knew just who to sin to that machine shot god knew whatever five or eight years it was before just who to have walked through the grocery store because he would actually talk to that man like if i was walking to him god would have to say talk to him but he knew john would just do it he he orchestrated his life amen he ordered it and john fulfilled the order of the lord i believe with all my heart he did what god had him on this earth to do there's a saying when i was a boy there was a preacher he was quite an elderly preacher by the time i was coming up but he's one of my grandpa's contemporaries his name is cash ambergee and he was a revival preacher and brother branham mentions him before on tape a couple times they preached together in new york meetings but when i was a boy they would every time cash would come by and visit the church they would always ask him to testify which that was the pentecostal way hey brother testify and he would stand up in his seat i remember it and i remember i was scared of him because he had a little leather wrap around his thumb because he only had a stub of a thumb because he was in a snake handling church in pentecost and he got bit by big jim and he lost the tip of his thumb so i remember as a boy being scared to death of cash amber because i know that he had poison in his thumb when i was a little bitty kid but this is who cash was and he quit believing in snake handling after that but anyways so he had this little leather wrap on his hand and he was quite elderly at this time and so i remember him well as a boy i was there one time and they say cash you want to testify and he stood up and he threw his hand in the air he says there's but one life and it soon will pass and only what's done for christ will last as he got older that would be the only thing he would say when they asked him to testify there's one but one life and it soon will pass and only what's done for christ will last what do we remember most about brother john that which was done for christ that part which will last what about us time continues we're allowed to go another decade two decades four decades five decades however long this continues on what will be said will there be a celebration of life for us and what will be celebrated in our life will it be celebrated that we sold all about the field that had the treasure will it be celebrated about us that we found the pearl of great price and we saw all of everything we had reputation and everything to have this will it be said of us that the thing that he did most and mattered most not his sideline gig not what he did on the side go to church yeah he was this this and this andy went to this church i don't want that to be said about me i want it to be said he was a christian man who lived for god and he had this job that's the order it should come in he was a first it should be he served god with all of his might he was wonderful to his family as a husband and a father and he went to this church i would love it to be in that order that's the order it should be in friends i believe that's the order it was in for our brother john and i thank god that i can preach this celebration of life amen with a clear conscience and say that matches our brother's life it's a wonderful thing prophet of god said friend death does not change a man it just changes your dwelling place so what do you think brother john did when he got to the sixth dimension he started fellowshipping of course we know exactly what he did because death does not change your death only changes your dwelling place and he probably i don't know i don't know what it's like there exactly i don't know what you feel like or what you understand or don't understand but i can imagine when he crossed to the sixth dimension and he was reunited with wilma he probably said tell me everything you've learned since you've been in here what have we been missing amen what's the other pieces what do you know what's happening next because death doesn't change you it only changes your dwelling place this is the only opportunity we have to give all to christ in this dimension in our bodies like this and i say let john's life be an inspiration to each of us let's break the alabaster box stop dipping portions out but let's just go ahead and break it and give it all let's quit trying to work a deal to hold the pearl and the other valuable things let's quit trying to get a lease on the land that has the treasure hidden inside but let's just sell everything and buy it let's just get everything else up for this pearl let's just break down the bastard box let's just give everything and if we can be inspired today by the life of our brother just to give them all then i'll say our brother will be happy that his celebration of life convinced us to go ahead and give them all and make a total surrender and god bless you friends we love you we're all here because we love the lord and we love brother john and may his memory amen be a pleasant one and a happy one for us all brother john if you can come we'll sing another song as we're dismissed ask the musicians to come with him let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the great privilege of being able to gather in this place today to be able to look at your word and say how wonderful it is lord and how much we love you we watched how much our brother loved you and how much he gave us all for this word and it inspires us lord to want to be the same i want to give you all lord let me walk forward from this day on not holding any portion back but let me give you everything and let the primary thing in my life and the life of everyone who's here be to give you all and to worship you alone may everything else in our life be counted as though it were done in comparison to christ lord i pray that you would bless the family they've already had time to mourn at the loss of our brother they'll continue to do so but may their memories be happy ones may there be some a thought of thanksgiving in their heart as they remember lord what there was to celebrate about in our brother's life and how assured they can be of his resting place of his life continuing on in the sixth dimension god i pray that you would just continue to bless them and comfort them all of us who have lost a friend lord lost a member of a congregation and part of the body of christ at large god you make sure that we have no lacking for somebody else will step in lord and do the job you've ordained them to do the lord we thank you for the life of our brother we thank you for living in him and shining through him so that we could see you in him we can know you better because of his life bless us now lord as we move forward may we move forward with courage lord to be the lights that shine in this dark age to be the witnesses that you have ordained and given strength to by the holy ghost to be your witnesses into all the earth may we each play our part god i pray that you would bless the dinner that we'll be having shortly that you would bless it make it strength for our bodies lord of nourishment for us may we enjoy the time of fellowship as nobody could enjoy fellowship as much as our brother john and lord if you allow one to look over the banister as your prophet said may he look over and see us fellowshipping keeping the continuation of fellowship going the traditional strong amongst us and may he smile knowing that we're continuing in what he loved as we fellowship one with another this afternoon as you bless all that's been said and all that's done for your glory and honor we say in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you brother john will lead us in a song and then we'll dismiss and after we dismiss you're welcome to go immediately to the fellowship hall there's a dinner prepared for everyone you're all welcome to stay if you
