fellowship dinner afterwards and we'd love for you to stay and join in and have fellowship with us and then we'll be coming back at 5 p.m for communion service you're welcome to attend that as well also it's a it's a special day it's a special day we have a special friend brother Abraham Myra from Uganda I mean he's always been a special blessing to me personally and to us as an assembly and so we're going to ask him to take the service again this morning and just preach what the lord has laid on his heart amen and then he always says he wish he was a preacher and whenever he says that I just put my head down and shake it I said oh my God Amen I think God knows who to call and where to place the gift and how to use it amen and I thank God that we can be the beneficiaries of that also at the end of the service this morning sister Amanda Davis would like to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so it'll be a great privilege to see her baptized so my wife and I had the privilege of sitting down with her this past week and hearing her testimony and how the Lord has drawn her amen and it's exciting it's exciting to see that God knows where to find his sheep and he knows how to draw them amen so it's a special privilege to be here it's a special day and we're glad that you're here with us amen let's just let's just prepare our hearts to receive the word and invite brother Abraham to come [Music] come on [Music] [Music] [Music] ah yeah [Music] yo once again I want to Salute Your Friends in the name of all Jesus Christ this morning and I'll request that your seat for a few seconds um I trust everybody's doing fine why not the house of the Lord amen the best place to be before we go there yes you know he promised us he gave us the privilege to be how for four houses you know your body is a house your home is the house the church is the house and there is another house that is going to prepare for you so we are thankful that at least all of us have got a house and all those four houses are available for you so you should thank the Lord amen of course he's not going to take you to his house the other one and until you take you take him to your house yeah suddenly it has been um a special time for me the other day I was the whole day with my grandkids playing with them you know there's only one thing that I couldn't do they wanted me to play football with them and I I think I'm getting a little bit older now so my legs may not be so good for football but I had a wonderful time and my grandkids have come very fast and they are all very health and strong so it was nice also and Young you see I really would say I prompt brother Moses my son-in-law to come here because I felt like when I come to Lima I should be hitting two birds with one stone I didn't want him to be away in Chicago and then it would compel me to go there you know so I'm very glad that whenever I passed by here I'm I'm having tooth you know two sources of inspiration and joy and gladness to families the spiritual family and also my my an extension of my family so I can see my friend brother Chester God bless you it's good to have you to see you here and many friends I was you know humble when I had people have traveled from Fairfield Alaska and Canada and may God bless you so much sometimes I get I get to wonder why maybe brother Chad was the one telling me that they are the ones to know the reason not to me so maybe they know that but um this one important thing for us is to become every day what God wants us to be because there is one signature statement time is no longer to be amen so the angel has already sworn and if that's what he said that's what it is so we really request for your prayers the challenge is everywhere you know like I said yesterday when you try to talk about the present tense God then the stone is always there you know the devil would want to Stone you because you are trying to connect yourself to the present tense of God you know you you would have no problem with the devil when you're queuing on the office that is already welcomed but when you are on the office that is working moving from the invisible God to the visible incarnate one then there is a problem you are always looked at as a danger to the devil yes but we are not going to retract we are not going to seed ground we are going to press on because the battle is the Lord is like our friend who was seeking singing Here stand still you know and um you are just like a body you know a shell but out of the shell will come forth a projectile the shell will fall down and sit still but a projectile from the shell is what will knock the devil down so we stand still because it's no longer our time it is him now and then a projectile will come from us so we thank God for the privilege so pray for us we shall always be praying for you remember you have a special place in our hearts and of course brother Chad will always say he benefits but I think I benefit more when I come and talk with him interact so many things that I I get to learn and yeah so maybe he learned something I think but I will always say I do that I always learn more I I really appreciate you friends so um it's just going time is running fast today is our last day again here and I'm happy it's my last day because I don't have much to say I'm finished I almost preached myself complete yesterday so I'm just now to Echo and say Amen thank you Lord and yeah so I really appreciate your friends so much so maybe we can just have a stand up and have a lot of prayer as we invite the Lord to come down loving Heavenly Father thank you Jesus for the privilege that we have been given by thy Divine Providence in a sovereign grace of God that in your great economy you saw us you knew us and you blessed us in your body we are now he is Lord a purchase of your blood as trophies in your hands and Lord I'm praying that you'll come down this day again Lord I know you have already come down but we pray the Lord even that anointing upon us will be realized and that God will have a way a special way you can deal with your children as I step out of the way thou knowest exactly what your children are needing what can be spoken for through the sleeps of clay that can edify exhort strengthen correct position you know it Lord with your own knowledge come and take over and bless the reading of your word and bless your servant anoint me strengthen me inspire me Lord Let It Be by your grace and For Your Glory in Jesus name we pray amen just thinking of some scripture I think something to do with the like a continuation of what we are preaching yesterday and I want us to go to the Book of Revelation chapter 1 and I'll pick from verse let me begin from verse 12. and I turned to see the voice that spoke with me and being turned I saw gold seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man closed with a garment downed the feet to the foot and got about the pups with the Golden Garden and his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire the one also got the book of Ephesians chapter five verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body may God bless his word and bless you may be seated yesterday we ended on a position where the Prophet was saying it behooves us to create a vulcence and then invite him that he may dwell in US because that's the final standard no man has gone this way before but this one man was gone and that is the Lord Jesus Christ amen he knows the way and he knows what he's going to do to make us you know to bring us to what he promised us and looking at the scripture here and it's interesting that um I know you've had many preachers preach this teach you this well I'm not a good teacher here but I just wanted to pick a thought just to add on what we're sharing yesterday and um you remember where we read John is hearing the voice speaking he was on this in the spirit on the Lord's day and he hide behind him a great voice as of a trumpet speaking and then in verse 12 he says he turned to see The Voice interesting because you don't turn to see The Voice you turn to see the person speaking but here he says he turned to see their voice just like in Eden the Bible says the voice of God was walking in a garden in the cool of the day The Voice walking so the voice was a person and here is also the voice is a person and John is standing to see The Voice and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and of course you know what is astounding for and in the midst of the seventh grade candlesticks one like unto the son of man is closed with the government down to the feet or to the foot and got about the pups with the Golden Garden and I wanted to pick something around there because when you come in I think in the look in the Book of Luke Chapter 11 it is interesting that the Bible emphasizing that is Passion that was speaking to the seven Church ages giving the message to John to project it to the seven Church ages is emphasizing something about him and he's saying that he was gut about the pups with the golden guttle and here in Luke chapter 11 verse 27 he says and it came to pass as he spoke of these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bear thee and the pups which thou has sacked so the pups are the breasts blessed be the name of the Lord and in chapter 23 I think the same Book of Luke chapter 23 if we shall um look at somewhere here I think it's verse 29 chapter 23 verse 29 Jesus himself is speaking and he says for behold the days are coming in the which shall they say blessed are the barren and the wounds that never bear and the perps which never gave suck so we see when John turns to look at Jesus of course Jesus is standing in the midst of so many golden candlesticks and he sees Jesus there is one particular feature about him he has got breasts that would sound strange isn't it that we have a man here stunning but with breasts perhaps and that's why my title this morning is the bright body the Christ speaking to his bride is Christ in a bright body speaking the message to the seven child changes that is going to produce the bride he is here standing as a man but with breasts and he's covering himself like a woman the holy government going down to the feet but he's The Voice so like we said yesterday he is the head and this is the body the body is the church in other words it was already a complete body speaking forth what it's going to be but according to God as far as God is concerned before he even speaks the word it's already done [Music] because God is not surprised that whatever is going to achieve he has already achieved it before he begins as far as you are concerned you are already in heaven you are already in glory you are already a Victor before you even fight the battle as a Believer as a child of God glory be to God that's why you see here he is already in the full bright body and he's giving a message to the seven Church ages he and John is looking who is this one Speaking and a person is speaking yes he has the head of a man but he has a part of a woman now how are you going to ever deny the word when they spoke it when you are there you are the body that was holding the head that spoke of the world and it becomes impossible because we're part of the speaking machine you're a part of that that that instrumental it's not spocket and how are you going to fail to appear there when you were there when you were speaking the word that's why brother Brahman comes us that angel that that God has the loopholes and ties them up and brings the full complete word from the 70 Church ages and reprise it and gives it as a full package to us so we have the full seven course menu and that's why you sit there and say hey man you receive it and the devil cannot stop you I don't care what you go through because you were there you were part of the body that spoke of the world [Music] you were that female body praise God that's why I say I wish I was a preacher I could start preaching now brother and now brother comes here and he says that there is a where he says he has something um he says hearing a message um I think it should be the Civil Church ages where he says what we need today is another old-fashioned God sent God Holy Ghost Revival amen I don't mean I am trying to get you get excited together excited I know you are not excited but brother that's the truth he says just trying to get the point to you it is truth it is what we need all right now that's the Bible that's what the spirit says the candlesticks all right now the 13 is verse one like the son of man what one like him one like him who was this one like him to be like Jesus who is that one like him he says one like him who was this he's bright yes his bride one like him watch how it was close with the government down to the foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood all right got about the pups not a man a woman a woman now this brother but I'm saying this person here this body here that was standing there in the middle of the golden seven golden candlesticks he's not a man he's a woman but the voices of a man the voice is the voice of Jesus Christ he's the one giving the word to John to project the message for the church ages to produce the bride but now in the body here that John is looking at he's a woman he says not a man a woman with a golden Garden the gospel that held the power and the glory of God over the blood of Christ Oh what a beautiful picture we got here under consideration look here down to the foot God about it pops with the golden gato and he comes down and he says don't try to hide from him you will not hide from him you were in him you were the body just like I was preaching somewhere you are part of the mouth that speak the word you only you are only spewed out when you become lukewarm because you are welcome and neither cold nor hot I'm gonna spew you out of my mouth but if you are not lukewarm if you are already hot Christian you remain in the mouth of God you remain there so the very mouth that spoke of the word you were there you're a part of the friend oh how do I say it you are part of that to say mouse that's pocket yes so how are you gone to to doubt it how are you going to turn against it when when God spoke the word and you were part of the mouth that spoke the word and that's what the devil doesn't want you to realize and the Bible says God speaks with the mouth and confirms vindicates with the hand fulfills it with the hand and yet in the hand you are also written there your names are encrypted there and the Bible says no man can take you out of his hand not even you can take you out of his hands as long as you're predestinated you are there glory be to God so he says don't try to hide from him he knows who you are Where You Are and what you've done yes sir he sees everything and then he says there he stands in another message one like unto the son of man one like he's not the son of man like Percy fully he's like he's not he is he is not the goddess he's of a woman the head is of the man the voice is the man the looks the woman the working woman the head the man who is this one looks like the son of man but it's not who is this one looks like him final office where we were talking yesterday the final office Christ in the bright body so he had that before the message he was ever breached and that's why you cannot get lost you cannot fail because you were already there Glory oh God and and no devil is strong enough to take you away from the benefits from the full potentials from what God designated for you and gave you as a package that this is yours you are part of me I am part of you we together fulfilled with this we together you and I glory to go there he stands one like I'm the son of man in the midst of exposure exposition of the Civil judge ages that is Vision he says like one like under the son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the Ring so he is glorified in the midst of churches it is the Lord is day so if it is the Lord is there it's the Lord to appear but who is this Lord who is this Lord this Lord is not a selfish Lord he said Lord that is sharing his glory with his body and his appearing and he's not ashamed to be the head of a breasted body after all he's also a breasted goat he's the El shaddar glory to God so we see ourselves there before the 70 Church ages begin to roll before appear John all these all these people you have talked about talk about you know you know you know you know only seven judgments saying yes and seven Church eight years and all that they preached and all the years and before that the message to the church ages is being spoken by the head that's mounted on the body and that body is the church is the bright that's going to be gathered from the several Church ages and you were there in that body brother sister you were there and that's why you are here and that's why sometimes you wonder why it's like I'm fighting but you are not fighting it's like I'm giving up but you're not giving up and the devil is like yes come on you're about to make it according to what I want but then all of a sudden bang and you are a different person and it ever doesn't get to understand it because we're there in that body and when somebody begins to bring something that's contrary from the Revelation that was given to accompany what was the message to you it's something in you doesn't click something tells you that's wrong glory be to God so it's the Christ body the I mean the bride body the Christ speaking to the bride it's the bride part of Christ speaking a message to the bride it's the church headed by Christ speaking the message to the church so how are you going to deny it just like but in the beginning let us make man in our image who was the letters who are they us let us make man in our image let me go back here so I I'm looking at the Inseparable omnipotent and unfailing Union of Christ and the church that's my subject it is impossible brother you will not fit anywhere else you will never be comfortable leaving Jesus living the world turning against the word it is impossible for you you can't survive you are the you are made to be there in that body amen that's who you are comfortable wherever he takes you you go amen glory be to God so you you see when you go back to Genesis chapter one this is a common scripture but it we can read it over a million times no problem Genesis chapter 1 verse 26. and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness this is what blows up the minds of denominational people the theologians say who are this who are they us let's make mine in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion now he says let us make man singular and let them plural God is saying God not God's God said let us plural now God's singular speaks plural God said that is singular let us plural make man singular in our plural image after our likeness plural and let them plural have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the Falls of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth saw God not gods singular saw God created man singular in his own image singular in the image of God created he him singular male and female created he them plural so who has the letters you will only know the letters who are those when you look at the man he has created in His image hahaha he has created a man singular but this man is boss male and female so that means if man that is created in His image his boss male and female then he is also a male and female and that's why the name Elohim comes in a plural although it's referring to an individual so now who created a man hmm because these little people is referring to as letters they are different people he's going to create so who created you who created a man any God is image and whom did he tell whom did he inform before he created a man in his or amen he informed the very attributes of man in him he discussed with the man he told the man that I'm going to make man I'm going to make you I'm going to create you in my image Hallelujah I am limited friends finished kaput I don't have more let us make man you know I mean God speaking here to his female counterpart about creating man that will reflect their image so that's the reason Adam was both male and female in his original creation created in the image of God so now Jesus comes as the beginning of the creation the second the restoration of the creation that was meant to be the holy seed the seed of the woman and then this Jesus also he is bringing a message that is going to produce a bride but now before he produces this bride he is already with his bride and they are speaking the message to the bride about the bride by the bride together with him [Music] they are sharing the same body they are together the bride is already there complete with his head and the breasts are there yay blessed [Music] okay okay okay sorry minutes it wouldn't imply it would imply that you see in other words the portion of money in other words attributes forms in attribute form sons of God sons of God was over with God when his book of the creation of man this would imply that God and man spoke man and or created the man into existence so Gordon and man spoke and created a man into existence isn't it you just have to forget that's why the prophet was saying yesterday get away very far from yourself from your opinion from your thinking from just forget about your foolish ideas you will not get this just become a fool and say yes because it's written Glory oh God so if God said if God is saved I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases and you were with him when he said that in other words he told you you are going to be on the earth you are going to be in time this particular time and I want to assure you that you were there and you accepted it you we were in the discussion God is not a dictator even agreed with you when you are going to be here maybe where that's why I'm not ashamed of being in Africa being in a jungle in a village I'm comfortable because that's where I agreed I'll be there and I will deal with them demons I'll stand there and shine forth his glory I'm not ashamed of being what I am wherever I am I am supposed to be wherever he posted Me by his only spiritual I mean Supernatural intelligence he knew you are going to be here get it yes you are going to first ABCD get it yes you are going to pass through this trouble this temptation this Affliction this that you lose this you miss this you know you'll be fought by this get it yes okay now that is tough to swallow for us the word so you you are very wrong brother you are very wrong sister when you begin to complain about whatever you are going through in other words that's why he says some of them neither complain as we are not supposed to complain we are not supposed to Mama you are just going through what you went through what you agree that you'll manage and you promised him that you'll go through whatever you are going through the Bible says when it's beyond your capability he makes a way out [Music] hey that's a little bit tough but this is the word brother now look at what a prophet is saying here dear God the Great and Mighty God who formed all of things by the power of His spirit and has brought Jesus Christ his only begotten son who freely died for we Sinners they just for the the unjust reconcile us back into His Marvelous Fellowship that we have again with God we have again did you get it who freely died for we Sinners they just for the and just to reconcile us back to reconcile that means there was a divorce there was a separation to reconcile us back into this marvelous Fellowship that we have again with God as we are taught in the Blessed world that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world you see so we had the fellowship with him before the foundation of the world and then we lost it when the city came in and now we are being restored back so how did you have fellowship with him when where before the foundation of the world and what is going to stop you now when God reconciles you back how can you fail to have fellowship with him how can you fail to praise him how can you pray fail to thank him to worship Him how can you fight to serve him how can you freely give yourself over to him what is what does hinder you what can hinder you what devil What Spirit what impediment because you had it before the foundation of before there was internet before there was even an America before there was an Africa yes yes before there was a car there was an invention before you even knew there would be Clovis all these things that we are talking about employment job this a lot promotion oh man you were there before you had that fellowship before in other words it comes as a priority once it is it is restored to you you take it I said this I had before I had this before I talked with my God before I worshiped him before I lived with him before I praised him before I worshiped him before I enjoyed this presence before so I am restored back nothing can now cut me shot [Applause] okay the fellowship brother we had with him before the evolution of the world or Canal When The Morning Star Sun together for joy and the Silence of God shouted for Joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was also slain yay belambo was also slain before the foundation of the world so Jesus didn't die 2 000 years ago I'm coming to something Jesus didn't die 2000 years ago the Lamb of God was slain before the foundation of the world that's what he Revelation 13 verse 8 says and that's when your names were written in the language Book of Life because the lamp was slain before the foundation of the world and let's go here somewhere in the book of Hebrews just for a reference here when you come in the book of Hebrews chapter 4. talking about the works The Works that I do shall you do also because I got the father I'm leaving the office for you you are now the office bearers you are now the Christ you are the Messiah and in Hebrew chapter 4 verse 3 he's talking about the Sabbath the rest he says for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest now he comes down here he says although The Works were finished from the foundation of the Wild the wax were finished from the foundation of the world so don't tell me Pastor I have very bad record I have poor Works my life doesn't really you know I'm this I am that I am a failure a failure by default it's the devil that is a failure by default right The Works your works The Works that you were supposed to do yes you have already done them praise God Amen before the foundation over there wow in other words maybe I use the word rehearsal you're rehearsed in there like our friends were singing here very good song but I believe they must have had some practice they are doing like this okay they didn't just study here it was done somewhere before now this was the presentation but where was the training somewhere in the closet the presentation is the public but now the training very hassle their preparation is somewhere and then we come here we see something very nice The Works finished before the foundation of the world so now talk about your failures talk about your Temptations talk about the language of too much this is too much this is too much this is too much forget that language throw it out of your vocabulary there's nothing too much no not as fast goddess language is concerned in relationship with you no glory be to God so he says when a Morning Star sung together and the sons of God shouted for job now let's go back quickly to the Book of Job we pick this up you remember the trials the hardships the losses that a job went through and this in the permission of God is permitting job to go through that end there maybe let me use the word Baka biting they are back abiding job with the Devil and job is not informed job is not informed that you are going to be tried so try upon trial sickness loss of this loss of that children die animals die all the riches disappear and our sickness strikes the body and he's just left his wife even tells him it's more better for you to die you are worse of death they did not leave it oh the trial was exposed the weakness in the wife of the church yeah Costco but look very intellectual Brothers came with a nice quotes aligned with them against his job zofa intellectual Brothers they looked at the situation from the times point of view yes they misunderstood God and when you misunderstand God you misunderstand God's children so they begin to say you are essay a sacred sinner this cannot happen God cannot really that and just cannot be that and just to permit this to happen to you impossible brother you they speak they speak chapters chapter after chapter chapter but job lost all the strength could not maybe stunned could not maybe even walk but God anointed the mouth the man could speak they speak he speaks they speak he speaks they speak the answers to they speak one the answers too one man against three until time become they became quiet and then he comes the minister of William Branham okay that introduces God himself speaks and then God comes down himself and addresses begins to address job now let's see in the in Job chapter 38 then the Lord verse 1. answer the job out of the Halloween and said who is this that Darkness cancel by words without knowledge now if you are careful he is not really the addressing job because he's reminding job that we had the council we had good counsel with you we talked about this we agreed about this but there is a spirit that they have come to darken the council and he says get up now loins like a man and I will demand of Thee and answer them where where was thou when I lay the foundation of the Earth declare if you have understanding who has laid officials thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon whereupon are the foundations of the I mean foundations they are fasting oh who laid the Cornerstone thereof when this the morning Stars sung together and all the sons of God shouted for joy so you mean to tell me that the job was not in that number he was there amen but he had forgotten what he did and he had he permitted the devil to come and darken that Guru Council the council in heaven that he talked with God and agreed to pass through this the Devil comes and darkens you up and who tries to stain you to disorient you to take you from the right Focus from the right fixation and begins to make you act as if you are not a believer but as far as God is concerned you are not lost it doesn't matter how how many words you are going to speak God also in his foreign when you get into the fellowship brother that original Fellowship your complaints your arguments your reasonings when he comes when you are restored back to that body where you were when the world was spoken and you were part of the speaking body that spoke of the word and you come in Fellowship again all these complaints disappear now if you come God speaks and speaks and speaks and when you come here in chapter 47 job is answering and how is he going to answer listen Mr God I'm going to present my needs to you and my complaint and you have to tell me why you permitted me to suffer as I have been crying you have answered my needs you have come now please sit down also and stand as God Mr God in your glory in your wisdom and answer me back no he says then job answer to the Lord and he said I know that thou comes to do everything and at no thought can be withheld hot withhold him from thee and now he comes and says who is he that hide this cancer without knowledge so he is asking who is this one that came and hid constant from me the counsel that I knew was hidden from me without knowledge what's the knowledge to know God he had the only God but now the devil has come and stolen it and hidden it and then he says therefore why why therefore because somebody came the devil came the devil came and stood and stolen Hadid my knowledge he did my in the council that I had known it was hidden from me and that's why he says therefore have I uttered that which I understood not things do wonderful for me which I knew not in other words the words of complaint murmuring saying this is too much I wish I admitted that God that was wonderful that was too strange language for job it was not supposed to be part of his vocabulary not questioning God why why God why why God why me why my family why me always who else why am I the one all the criticism all the abuses all the targets are if it's the sickness if it is this if it is this if it is hatred people everywhere ahead to me I have no favor so which flavor do you want which which is above the favor that God gave you his favor is more than any other flavor amen and the Bible says woe unto you you follow men speak well about you because they only spoke good about fellows prophets so if you want to be spoken well off then become a false prophet which you can't now it is impossible you will not and as long as you are preaching the truth they will hate you they will speak about you they remember all sorts of insults they'll look for something to criticize and there is a lot about us to criticize that's what the prophet said if you come even to church like this looking for something to criticize you'll find a lot of it Jesus so job is answering he says somebody the devil came and hid the council and I remained without knowledge therefore I have spoken of uttered the things that are too complicated things that I could not even understand things that are too wonderful for me I am even beginning to Marvel how I spoke on this world I'm wondering am I even the one who spoke of this how did it come that I spoke of this how did it come that I behaved like this how did it come that I even quarreled you with my life and I told her I think I made the wrong woman how did I say that she's your wife this business of casting around you reach entertainment you see the foolishness out of say what happened am I the one who spoke those words how did I speak am I the one who questioned the authority of my relationship with God whether I'm an elect or not whether God loves me or not whether I'm the foolish virgin or the truth the Wise One whether I'm going in Rapture or not how did those questions even come why did I step on the other negative side how did it happen I spoke of volumes and job must have gone back somebody must have been available you know writing and he must have looked at what he spoke how he challenged how he defended his Integrity defended his Holiness I am a good man I am like this I was telling some brothers it is very common these days when you say God bless God bless you how are you I'm good I said that's a lie we love that but he said lie of the end of time who told you that you are good Jesus said no man is good he even denied it himself why do you call me good but he said it's a very good thing I am good very very common how are you brother I'm good like like like I was talking with some friends somewhere and you know these days even to say I'm sorry people don't want to say I'm sorry they say my bad hey to look modern to sound like I'm not a project I'm it is military to to tell a phenomena I'm sorry so I'm glad my bad whatever if it is b-i-r-d-o-b-a-i b a b i don't mean I don't understand what you're meaning by my bird blessed be the name of the Lord you even forget your language repentance is a language of a believer it's very easy to come out of the problem by saying Dear Honey forgive me I'm sorry instead of a dream and it's chewing and throwning and closing your eyes and banging the plates down and checking around and you become do you know when you are annoyed you become more heavy you boom boom boom boom you move around because demons are full of you and you are full of demons and then you are you are banging the ground like like is there an elephant passing around that's not your language your language is not right you it's not even to defend yourself the Bible says why would you not rather I accept to be to to be to be defrosted why don't even accept they're wrong it's either a bonus if you repent for something that you know you have not even done that's Christian that's the language of Heaven I'm sorry forgive me instead of valuing hey he's the one who say this no I speak as a Christian Pastor he's the one who said it is she I would have said this if she didn't say this she said this that's why I also said it is that's an Christian that was not there the attributes there when you were in God where did you get this it is a must because this Stone which was cut out from the original Rock was thrown here and now it's been dormant there and the Moss has gathered on it and it thinks I'm a Mr Green when he's such a white one oh let me hold everything and rush to Isaiah chapter 51. so that you get a picture of what I'm talking about Isaiah chapter 51 verse 1 he says second to me ye that follow righteousness ye that seek the Lord look at the Rock once you were healed and to the whole of the pit once you are digged so they you are here as a rock a small Stone a small rock cast from the major Rock and that rock is Christ that is God himself the word and anyone here but because you are thrown in time a lot of noise gathered around you and now when you look back the hall where they cut you you didn't even you don't even freak because you have a lot of additions on you graph things that were not there when they were cutting you but because you have stayed here climate and moisture and so forth has taken his toll on you there's some additions on you that were not there so compare yourself with that whole can you fit no then that means it's time to scrape you now time to be scrapped and to be washed and then they will fit you back because you're forgotten you think this is where you belong you think the most is your god your government your government is not Moss you are not an American to speak like an American American language American attitude and blah blah blah you're a Christian you are you're an attribute of God and we are fellowshipping here because we are the fellowship it's the fellowship of attribute it's not the Fellowship of the right hand The Fellowship of the right hand is hypocritical God bless you brother God bless you but it down in his heart he doesn't even love you God bless you God bless you God bless you That's The Fellowship of the right hand Paul says they gave him the right hand of Fellowship because they were not believing his Gospel of circumcision and his circumcision they were holding on circumcision so they just gave him the right hand of Fellowship brother when we meet each other's Brothers but I don't agree with you but they were refusing to agree with the Revelation that was God they had given them Messenger to the egg they were sticking to all the Orthodox rules of circumcision and trying to look good among the Jews so they preach a produ produced gospel and that's why Paul rebuked the Peter Peter was trying to still hold on until those all the traditions and garages of the Israelites to appease and Paula first to him he said well anyway private you ate with the Gentiles now when we are in public we are hiding ah Paulo became a problem but it became a problem because Paul was saying all that was gained to me all that the reputation I had all the good words they were speaking about me everything about the game I I just counted it as done the most I cut it off I told Jesus to scrape it off that I mean we remove him so where were you and the job is saying how is he concluding now he says in verse 5 of chapter 42. he says I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear but now my eye sees you that's the Christ we're talking about yesterday Christ that can be felt embraced and sin and he says wherefore I abide myself and repent in the dust and his ashes so job repents no more reason he's connected back to the original praise God now the prophet continues here he says tonight we have only got a fortress of that Glory that great Glory Divine which shall be revealed at his coming second coming all sickness and sorrow shall be done away with then we will have a body like his own glorious body we shall see him as he is now come here he says and then Christ died to save those who by God by far knowledge elected to meet before the foundation of the world he's seen you in glory before the foundation of the world you were with him in the glory and he saw you in glory again now if God did that predestinated us before the fullness of the world he knew every one of us by name before the foundation of the world and elected us to eternal life and send Jesus Christ to redeem us that 6 000 years ago he saw us that he might appear to his prayer that he might have that we might appear to his Praises in glory how can you ever be lost now if you are saved you are saved if God Saves you tonight knowing he's going to lose you 10 years from today he's defeating his only purpose the infinite Almighty internal Everlasting wisdom God doesn't know that that I mean he doesn't know enough then to know whether you hold out hold out or whatever you want that means if God was to save you anointing it's like a try and error kind of business then that means that he didn't know enough glory to God and when you also begin to doubt your salvation that means you are trying to think to insinuate that God doesn't know enough he didn't know you enough he didn't know enough about the trials that you are going to face about the sicknesses that are going to come your way about the Temptations He didn't I I if he knew me wouldn't have called me I think he didn't look at what is coming that's what we are trying to listen but that's not a reality you're just using your mind that's spiritual amnesia but God will Overlook all that and still get you he knows how to do it Glory Be oh God now let me come to something here I want to you know to finish here when you come here in this court blessed be the name of the Lord he's talking about let us go back to the ministry of brother Branham and see what's back to him from denominational you see to the experiencing of God let around the station let alone the visitation of the angel many times you remember he said I call you but you do not I call you but you would not he kept resisting the call of God but now listen he had that Baptist culture around him the most and here he comes and speaks about it in a message here we have no continuing system he says and the only fellows standing there you know and all the ministers that they had been preaching on what Jesus done and so forth but he never taken he took his text from over in a job somewhere there where he said where were you when I lay the foundations of the world When The Morning Star sung together and and sons of God shouted for joy well we are the ministers was bringing the activities of the church on the Earth walks on Earth what you do on Earth brings it whereas the other ministers were preaching about the works the activities of the church on Earth he went up into the heavens about 10 million years before the world was ever formed and he came down the horizontal rainbow with him and about that time listen he got down he there he let out a great big hoop and he jumped up and he clicked his heels together and remember this was a very old man with stupid shoulders and the prophet pitted him he said why these people could not even sympathize with this old man sending him to the palpit to preach with a bent back and moving around and and then he started but now when he went to connect back I wanted you to look at that when this old man connected to where he was not where we are they asked what I have done I am a dotted man I am a sinner I've made a lot of mistakes I'm a failure I am this I am that people don't like me I think I'm I have a problem I I don't succeed I am go back so when this man went to connect back he came back and he came he let out a very big whoop he said whoopee you got no room for me here to preach [Applause] ah he he jumped up and clipped his heels together and said glory to God you ain't got no room enough here up here for me to preach what clicked in that holy man he connected to that life he connected to that reality he connected what we were before time and what is going to make us strong resilient Victorious faithful Victorious moving forward not looking at this not looking at your history not looking at what people what surrounds you not looking at your weaknesses but going way back connecting to internity and listen what a problem the prophet says he says Glory oh God you ain't got enough room up here for me to preach and then the prophet says I looked at that and I said well if that will make an old man like that act like that [Applause] what would it do to me if I got some of it what do you want to do if I got some of it I said I want some of that that's what I want if it can make an old man like that act like that what would it do for me listen he brings it from another angle this holy preacher come out to preach he said was going to preach the message that night and they all the fellow came out and I thought poor old brother he was all just crippled up like this he come out and he took his text from over I believe in Job chapter seven or something somewhere there and when where where where were you when I lay the foundations of the world said he when this morning star sang together and sons of God shouted for Joy now listen and instead of preaching what he would have been done what would what he would have done here on Earth yeah he took him up back ayonda about 10 000 years before the world was ever formed and brought him down across through the skies and come down the horizontal rainbow back Yonder into internet and when that old fellow get got anointed where did he get the anointing not from here not from the preachers here not from what others comparing notes with what others are preaching am I right am I wrong I actually compare with brother so and so preacher so and so no but going back to connect connect to what you will what you did the works that you did before the foundation of the world the summons that you preach brother child the Amendments that you were shouting there the hallelujahs the glory to God they praise the Lords you connect the back of there when the sons of God shouted together for sorrow where the sons of God came together to be mourned their condition when the sons of God went to to meet one another and then talk about what should we do Christianity has become a problem they shouted for joy [Music] you break the devil's nerves you throw him into confusion you make him completely run out of what to do when you are always positive shouting praises to the Lord regardless of whether you are sick poor in conditions that if flavor out of season in season whether things are good or bad you have connected it back and you throw the devil's Kingdom into confusion the devil doesn't know what to do with you and the prophet says thank God there is a church today there is a people today that will live such a life that will make the devil find what to do with them the devil gets confused he doesn't know what to do with you because he doesn't know where you're drawing your inspiration from you are not drawing it from the surrounding it's not because you have a comfortable back account not because you have a good job not because you have a good house and because you are surrounded with friends not because everybody is but because you are connected behind there [Applause] you know where you come from you know where your inspiration is coming from Glory oh God that's what's back brother Branham to look for the real Revival since I wanted that yes that can make an early wrinkled up man and say jump up and so be you have no room for me you have to preach what energized him what strengthened him he saw himself in the body he saw how he was rejoicing he was in the land where all the edge is nothing we are stopping shoulders are nothing we are acting stomachache headache nothing was there where poverty was not there nakedness was not there friends and see all these kind of things that make us happy we're not there it was just being in him oh yeah oh I wish I was a better one oh his Ace that old oh that old fellow got so anointed him he jumped in the air and he kicked his heels together and he hollered who pee and walked off the platform and looked around he had more room than I've got up here but he said you have got not you've not you ain't got enough room up here for me you people I feel like exploding where we're exploded from I feel like I should lose something what should I do where do you think you devil you are [Music] I am judged I'm plugged in to the power source Glory oh God I am no longer this one who doesn't know who his papa remember is some kind of hybrid new but it's a pedigree horse hey full of powerful of matter full of Revelation and it prancing around with authority blooded oh God you prance around you show your Source where you come from your origin until the devil gets scared and starts barking away then I can't stand this situation I cannot stand this man I can understand this human because you have connected back to the other body [Applause] when you spoke or that one ho ho that's why the Bible is not a problem to a True Believer it's a problem to any believers the message the Bible it's not a problem to a True Believer it will come no matter how hard it is just train yourself start exercising that's what the prophet says acts upon the word start acting upon the word this day is when you when we begin to get old now I'm 50 to normal 53 years and then I begin to say You're such when you start seeing something weakness you start some exercise when they were you know do something to to keep yourself fit you know glory to God so when you see somewhere in your life there's a problem just come back connect back and start with some exercise say this this is not what I'm supposed to be I'm supposed to be on fire I'm supposed to pray for that I'm supposed to serve Allah I'm supposed to be a child of God I cannot be intimidated by my neighborhood by the office I worked my comrades my pals my friends blah blah I want you to come to the point where you are going to ask for more room more room of display Lord I'm full of power I'm full of matter where do I now go not scared and cornered in a corner and scared to death embarrassed of what you believe hiding your face as it were they are looking where are they oh look for my room now when you connect there you look for room you look for more Devils too you will say where are they you are not going to run away from demons that's why I've never that's why even when I pray for the sick by for the Demonic possessed and those people who are cruel and terrible I don't even ask someone's company because I don't even need a person I don't know whether he was there or not and I don't know whether he has plugged him there or not I know when I plug her there I can deal with anything it's not me it's not me It's the final blood of Christ here like we were saying yesterday I just created a vacancy and he invited him come well here continue with your plans continue with your works The Works that were finished before the foundation of the world I am you see when you go on the stage when you have practiced enough you have rehearsed you are not scared with my little experience with the guitar if I mean to pick it now and sit somewhere I can close my eyes and sing a song I don't have to keep looking at my fingers I have that experience so if you are experiencing him all that even what Jesus did you were in Jesus you already have enough experience and enough power and then have authority blessed be the name of the Lord glory to God this is what the prophet is saying so God also orders all of us look back why do should we look back you know what did Jesus said Jesus also reminded the disciples so have you even forgotten you're complaining about great the five pieces of bread how many people afraid by it five thousand how many basketballs do you pick so much what about this one are you so forgetful um blessed be the name of the Lord we are not supposed to be forgetful look at somewhere first Samuel chapter 7 17. David goes back to The Testament when he's first with Goliath and he's challenged let's read it let's see as I finish here first Samuel chapter 17. they see from us that verse 33. and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art that I use and he a man of war from his youth that is contradictory he is what he is because he was a Warrior from the youth and for me you don't want me to fight from my youth you are discouraging me because I'm a youth and for him is what he is because he started fighting from his youth so I should also start my career when I'm here ever started for he says and everything say that so thy servant kept his father's ship testimony now and took a lamb out of the floor and I went out after him and smore him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I call him by his beard smart him and flew him you think it was that younger David he's using the word I but it was the anointing in the David he was already anointed king he has made us Kings and Priests so you have the confidence that if I'm already sanctioned kept preserved protected what will the devil do to me so he says I killed it then verse 35. thy servant I mean it's other six the seven salute boss The Lion and the Bear and this uncircumcised the Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he has defied the armies of the Living God why is David going back you know when the ship have you ever seen a ram when it's going to fight it goes back say come on let me know let me come from somewhere and let me gain momentum and he comes with a lot of force it doesn't hit you from there when you provoke it let me go back to the holy testimonial archives [Applause] the god that did this for me the god that delivered me from this is here that is the nature of sheep but the stubborn gods are the ones that begin from the very place those are good you are playing with me you don't know me I can hit you hey the gods always look at where they are standing and they just lift up their health is in Prestige and pride so you are joking you don't know me but if God ever made a mistake to fight with the ram he's going to die because he will be there in a safe place like this and then the realm will go back let me connect back to the power plug [Applause] and then it comes and hits it that'll be the end so that's our nature as the Sheep of God Amen amen we go backwards Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we're only beginning with tomorrow we begin with what he was yesterday what he was he is and what he is he will be blessed be the name of the Lord so that's why today there must be a Christ here after the message has been completed to the seven Church ages now that full bride again appears the same bright body that spoke with the head of Christ or oh it's the same one that's why you see the head of Christ appearing in the cloud the reason the devil doesn't he wants that one hey doesn't want that club because he was coming to unite and to seven angels the world receives a cloud and the bride sees the head seven angels forming the head what is the head the intelligence here the mouth uniting with the body and brother was caught up in a blast and he was lifted up to meet those angels then otherwise he was caught up to put on the headship that head in order to speak the Mysteries speak to who why was he caught up because he was just introducing that head to the real owner the full one the bride Jesus the bride of Christ is here that's why he says behold the bridegroom I no longer caller you Church you are now bride Mrs Jesus because the head plus the body will identified same Authority that spoke on the message is the same Authority that is receiving the message and on behalf of the body so who eats who eats says go and take the book you go and take the book you are the body you are the hand take the book but who is eating the book amen the head is eating the book and who is the head the head is Christ the body is picking the food the book and the head is eating the book on behalf of the body so it's Christ himself receiving his own word in his bride is Christ himself believing his word and that's why it's impossible for this bride to fail just go back to what you weigh and connect back you are going to look for more room say give me room now I want to give me some devils to tackle give me some problems here now where are they where are they that's where we are coming that's where I am I don't want to die I want to say like David I shall not die but I shall live and declare the works of the Lord I shall not die but declare the works of Messiah The Works of Jesus Christ in the body in the bright body is here advice I don't want to run away from this wall as a coward has a failure and I don't know how to take contentment from others that what I've what I've seen done I want to serve him until he when he pleases to take me home or if it is the rapture wonderful so I will just hear briefly to encourage you friends that don't you ever let the devil deceive you that you are a failure don't you ever believe the devil's lie that this message is too hard you are the one who spoke it together with him so how can you doubt what you spoke you are that pretty steady person there you are not blessed anybody [Laughter] Christ in the bright body speaking to his bride and the remaining in his bride and performing it in his bride and manifesting it and leaving it showing his glory in his bride so how can Christ fail he may be sure this time there is no failure room there's no room for failure he made Yeshua I'm sure for that there's not going to be a failure unless you were not there but if you were there you are going to make it may God bless you let's stand up [Applause] let's pray maybe you want to be remembered in a prayer for whatever reason you know the reason but there's a lot that you can ask him for as we go to pray just humble yourself believe in your heart and lift up your hand let's pray Heavenly Father what a Time what a glorious message what are special people a specified message classified for classified people and we are here Lord what shall we say how can we even mama how can we even complain how can we even say I can't manage when we were with you speaking forth this message we were that breasted body that held your head that carried your head and you said in your word and if I'll be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me we just want to lift you up we want to be the body so that you're the head and let God whatever you spoke you've come and eaten it yourself the book that you commanded John to go and take and eat who is eating it yourself that's why there is sweetness in the mouth because the mouth cannot experience bitterness since it's the one that's pocket it's only the digestion in the body in the church that appears bitter but Lord once it has entered the digestive system how we will it ever come out you the mouth will never allow us to vomit it the tables are full of vomit for those who are not part of the body but this table here yes cannot be having any vomit because everything that is eaten is eaten by you and it's kept by you is guaranteed that it cannot come out help us Lord that we come to this hour boldly to prophesy again full of that anointing connected back to what we were in eternity and knowing that the devil doesn't want us to recognize that bad you don't even seek the devil's permission when you want to reveal yourself to us you didn't even seek the devil's permission when you saved us when you called us and you are not going to seek the devil's permission to manifest yourself in US to prove your word to redo the works that were finished before the foundation of the world and you are doing them using the hands of the body and the body is your bride Lord I'm praying that you'll help us and the Lord you are anointed to come and then girlfriend swallow and stop you everybody here Lord at every disease every every pain every ailment every negative spirit will be defeated in the name of Jesus and the Lord called your power will come you are Glory you will be shared you said it because Jesus Jesus yourself you said one time glorify me with the glory that I had with you before the world began and it is thundered and our Lord God the father was saying have both glorified it and I'll glorify again this is the time for the second glorification may you glorify yourself because you are Christ in the bright body glorify yourself in this body with the same Glory that she had with you before the world was met that's why her names were written there before the foundation of the world that's why you died for her before the foundation of the world that's why her Works were finished before the foundation of the world and the devil can never stand and I choose her successfully over any works because her works are finished and sealed away help us Lord We Just Surrender that we are perfect will and I pray that God will follow this word in the hearts of your children Quicken us to what you want us to be and bring us back to manifest Lord what we where commissioned and what we accepted to do before the foundation of the world granted the father in Jesus name we pray amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] Lord Lift Me Up [Music] at last [Music] [Music] my heart has no no he's hard to stay we're down to rise [Music] my prayer my aim is higher ground Lord lift me up and let me stand my faith on hand s better Lord prep my feet on higher oh praise God how how good does it do to us to realize amen that it was finished before the foundation of the world that is not based on my effort it's based on his will and his plan and he's providing the power to overcome because he willed it before oh my goodness no matter what we find ourselves in it was finished before the foundation of the world no matter what trial what Temptation what difficult circumstance The Works were finished before the foundation of the world oh God help us to get to the place where we stop going into panic I've wanted this for years I want to stop going into panic when trouble comes but I want to start moving into anticipation saying oh God I can't wait to see what you've already ordained for this overcoming amen because I know that you've already ordained an overcoming amen because it was before praise God amen it's amazing that we believe not because we've been intellectually taught we believe because we heard it before we come from the mind of God we were there when he made the decree when he showed the Plan of Salvation we rejoiced with joy and shouted with joy and gladness amen I'm so glad that the amen doesn't come from the brain the amen comes from the soul amen we have natural ears and maybe for the first time our natural ears we hear something amen but there's something inside that says I've heard that before amen amen means so be it that's the truth that's right how do you know it's right it's the first time you heard it it's the first time I've heard it here but it's not the first time I've heard it here so down here is an amen so be it that's right praise God Amen I'm so thankful that we've got a message that will connect us back to where we came from to give us the power to overcome by his grace amen are you thankful I am so thankful may God amen may God find in me a willing vessel that will surrender all thinking all will all desire and empty out and invite him to come and fill up to do what he's always intended to do through this vessel may he find that in me may find it in you may we surrender fresh to him I mean we're going to close with a word of prayer and then of worship we're going to invite sister Amanda if you want to make your way back amend and prepare for the baptism let's just bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for the word that you have spoken to us God for me know that you used a vessel to preach it but Lord it was you in the vessel God we receive the word from you it connected us back to what we've heard before and God within us there's a
