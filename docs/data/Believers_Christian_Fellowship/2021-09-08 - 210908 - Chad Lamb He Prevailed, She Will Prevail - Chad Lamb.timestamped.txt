[7:36] lord as we surrender to you now
[7:38] under the under the breaking of the
[7:40] bread of the coming forth of your word i
[7:42] pray that we would surrender to the word
[7:43] lord that you could take preeminence

[7:49] first place and may you live through us

[8:24] go rejoicing lord at the at the bread of
[8:26] life that you've given to us
[8:29] we ask that you'd bless us now as we
[8:31] take this bible and open it and begin to
[8:33] read it lord may it be more than an
[8:35] exercise of literacy
[8:37] but be it may it be by supernatural
[8:39] revelation and by a gift lord that
[8:41] you've placed in a body to preach the
[8:44] word and lord may it take effect and
[8:45] fulfill the purpose that you've designed
[8:48] for this hour for this day that we live
[8:50] in
[8:51] have your way amongst us we pray in
[8:53] jesus christ's name
[8:55] amen
[8:57] god bless you all let's take our bibles
[9:01] while we are
[9:03] still standing and turn to revelation
[9:05] chapter 5.
[9:09] amen revelation chapter 5
[9:11] and we'll read two verses of scripture
[9:14] verse 4
[9:16] and verse 5.
[9:17] continuing on the same vein of thought
[9:19] because i can't get any other vein amen
[9:22] it's just god just has us meditating in
[9:25] this same area and so we thank god for
[9:28] that we're just going to keep going as
[9:29] long as the lord leads
[9:31] and
[9:32] and so for a title i just titled this he
[9:35] prevailed
[9:36] she will prevail
[9:38] he prevailed she will prevail let's look
[9:40] at this scripture in
[9:43] chapter 5 verse 4
[9:45] and i wept much because no man was found
[9:47] worthy to open and to read the book
[9:50] neither to look thereon
[9:52] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[9:54] not behold the lion of the tribe of
[9:56] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[10:00] to open the book and to loose the seven
[10:02] seals thereof amen you can have your
[10:05] seats
[10:07] so we see that
[10:10] the
[10:10] the line of the tribe of the judah
[10:13] the root of david hath prevailed
[10:16] and he hath prevailed to open the book
[10:19] and brother branham makes a statement in
[10:20] the breach
[10:22] he says and john started crying because
[10:24] no one was worthy and no one could even
[10:27] look at the book oh it took a human
[10:29] being john webb because no one could do
[10:32] it and everything was lost and there
[10:34] came a voice from one of the elders
[10:36] standing in the midst of the four beasts
[10:37] and all the great host of heaven said
[10:39] don't weep john
[10:41] oh my the grace of god don't be
[10:43] broken-hearted john don't weep for the
[10:45] lion of the tribe of judah the root and
[10:47] offspring of david he has prevailed
[10:50] prevail means to wrestle with and
[10:52] overcome oh my
[10:55] so i want to talk about that as well
[10:56] brother branham says
[10:58] he prevailed and brother gives us the
[11:00] definition of prevail means to wrestle
[11:02] with and overcome and he says in the
[11:05] garden of gethsemane when his blood
[11:07] dropped down out of his face he was
[11:09] overcoming amen
[11:11] the lion the root and the root of david
[11:14] has prevailed hath has overcome
[11:18] and so now we want to look at this
[11:20] prevail he prevailed it means he
[11:24] wrestled with
[11:25] and he overcome
[11:27] and when brother bam gives us that
[11:29] definition he goes right to the garden
[11:30] of gethsemane and then he says in the
[11:33] garden of gethsemane when his blood
[11:35] dropped down his face he was overcoming
[11:37] and showing that he was overcoming in
[11:40] gethsemane and he had to wrestle with
[11:43] and overcome and the question is what
[11:46] was he wrestling with in gethsemane
[11:50] i mean he was he was overcoming amen he
[11:53] had to prevail he had to prevail amen so
[11:56] that he could take this book and he had
[11:58] to prevail amen for the process of
[12:01] redemption amen to come into fruition he
[12:03] had to prevail but in order to prevail
[12:06] before he went to calvary first he had
[12:08] to go to gethsemane and when he go to
[12:10] gethsemane he had a wrestling match in
[12:13] gethsemane
[12:15] and the wrestling match in gethsemane
[12:17] was with his own will amen
[12:20] we can pick that up in the scriptures
[12:21] let's go to matthew 26 so we can see
[12:23] this together
[12:30] matthew chapter 26
[12:33] and we'll look at verse
[12:35] 36
[12:36] matthew 26 and we'll start at verse 36
[12:43] then cometh jesus with them into a place
[12:45] called gethsemane and saith unto
[12:47] disciples set ye here while i go and
[12:49] pray yonder
[12:51] and he took with him peter and the two
[12:52] sons of zebedee and began to be
[12:54] sorrowful and very heavy then say at the
[12:57] end of them my soul is exceeding
[12:59] sorrowful even unto death tarry ye hear
[13:03] and watch with me
[13:05] so he begins to express
[13:07] to these three that he has to come along
[13:10] with him he begins to express to them
[13:13] his great sorrow and he says in my soul
[13:16] he's using the extreme language my soul
[13:18] is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death
[13:22] amen so now he's feeling the full brunt
[13:25] amen he's feeling the full uh weight
[13:28] he's in gethsemane amen and jesus when
[13:31] he went to fulfill the word when jesus
[13:33] was you know jesus was born the lamb of
[13:35] god amen he was the word
[13:38] made flesh he was the fullness of the
[13:39] word and made flesh and he was the body
[13:42] that god built to dwell in he was all of
[13:45] this amen when it came time for the word
[13:48] the very purpose of his birth to come to
[13:50] fruition and it came time for the very
[13:53] manifestation of the thing that he was
[13:55] born as the lamb of god to be the
[13:57] sacrifice to take away the sins of the
[13:59] world when he comes to it he's got to
[14:02] pass through gethsemane in order to keep
[14:04] the word and in passing through
[14:05] gethsemane he feels the full brunt of it
[14:09] amen he was the word made flesh amen he
[14:12] was the body that god chose to dwell in
[14:15] he was the son of god but he wasn't
[14:17] skipping through gethsemane to go amen
[14:20] i've got a promise in my life and i'm
[14:21] going to fulfill this promise in my life
[14:23] and praise the lord isn't this wonderful
[14:25] i'm the chosen vessel
[14:28] i'm the chosen one and the and the word
[14:30] is going to be made manifest in me and
[14:33] and i'm going to uh there's going to be
[14:35] redemption because of me but when he
[14:37] gets down to it amen he's he's
[14:39] exceedingly sorrowful unto death
[14:45] it's good friends
[14:47] because he laid a pattern for us
[14:52] he laid a pattern down for us
[14:54] and he and he now begins to say
[14:57] he's exceedingly sorrowful even unto
[14:59] death terry you hear and watch with me
[15:02] this full this full effect of the word
[15:04] coming to the hour of the manifestation
[15:06] of the word this full effect that it's
[15:08] having on him as a human being amen does
[15:11] not diminish the fulfillment of the
[15:13] prophecy does not diminish the words
[15:15] that have been spoken of him and the
[15:17] prophecies all down through the old
[15:18] testament none of that's diminished but
[15:20] he still has to pass through it he still
[15:23] feels it he still has to go through the
[15:25] process of surrendering to the father
[15:29] verse 39 and he went a little farther
[15:31] and fell on his face and prayed saying
[15:33] oh my father if it be possible let this
[15:36] cup pass from me
[15:38] nevertheless not as i will
[15:40] but as thou will
[15:41] so here this is expressing his wrestling
[15:44] match and we've talked about this this
[15:46] isn't the first time we've talked about
[15:47] this but he's expressing it he's asking
[15:50] father if it's possible let this cup
[15:53] pass from me
[15:55] jesus would like to bypass
[15:59] suffering
[16:02] he would like to bypass the thing that
[16:04] he's moving into and he's asking the
[16:07] lord if there's any other way he's
[16:09] asking the lord lord if it's possible
[16:12] he's sorrowful unto death exceedingly
[16:15] sorrowful unto death amen he's praying
[16:18] earnestly to his father and he's asking
[16:21] his father is there any other way is it
[16:24] possible for this cup to pass from me
[16:28] if it's possible let this cup pass from
[16:31] me
[16:32] nevertheless
[16:33] not as i will but as thou wilt
[16:38] this is the wrestling match
[16:42] this is what he's wrestling with
[16:44] not my will
[16:46] your will
[16:48] brother branham said in gethsemane
[16:50] he was prevailing amen wrestling with
[16:54] and overcoming
[16:55] wrestling with his own free moral agency
[17:00] is that true
[17:01] we're going to read several quotes for
[17:02] brother ben tells us that wrestling with
[17:04] his own free choice wrestling with his
[17:07] own will and he had to go through the
[17:09] process of laying down his life laying
[17:12] down his will the father follow the word
[17:16] for his season the word for his age he
[17:18] had to lay down his life amen to follow
[17:21] the father's will he had to surrender
[17:23] his own will to follow the father's will
[17:26] and that whole process listen this this
[17:29] wasn't just
[17:31] he wasn't just acting this out amen he
[17:33] was experiencing it
[17:36] he was living it he was fleshing it out
[17:39] it wasn't just a trivial thing like i
[17:41] said before this wasn't light this
[17:43] wasn't just a passing fleeting thing and
[17:46] i'm just going to act this little part
[17:48] out he was living it friends he was
[17:50] going through it he was suffering
[17:52] through it enduring through it and he
[17:53] was surrendering under it
[17:56] and i pray that god will help me express
[17:58] this the way
[18:00] the lord's been revealing it to me so
[18:01] that we understand it had to be this way
[18:05] amen it could be no other way this is
[18:07] the way it had to be
[18:09] verse 40 says and he cometh unto the
[18:11] disciples and findeth them asleep and
[18:13] say unto peter what could you not watch
[18:16] with me one hour
[18:18] look at the disappointment of the lord
[18:23] he is so
[18:26] he is so afflicted he is so weighted
[18:29] down he is so sorrowful he is in such a
[18:33] wrestling match he's looking for
[18:35] somebody just to watch with him and pray
[18:37] with him and help me
[18:40] have you ever been there
[18:43] i just if it comes to peter
[18:46] now listen the lord is suffering
[18:48] tremendously
[18:50] and he comes to peter one of his closest
[18:53] confidence and one of his closest
[18:54] disciples and he finds him asleep and
[18:57] you can see you can hear the
[18:58] disappointment in his voice when he
[19:00] asked peter could you not watch with me
[19:03] one hour
[19:05] i'm dying and you don't understand
[19:11] because
[19:12] like i said this is laying an example
[19:14] for us all
[19:16] because there's times that we have to
[19:18] come to surrender to the word and
[19:20] there's nobody else that can walk that
[19:22] path with you when it come time for
[19:25] jacob to wrestle with the angel amen he
[19:28] had to go alone when he got all by
[19:30] himself that's when the angel appeared
[19:32] to him so he had something to wrestle
[19:33] with and latch a hold of he was
[19:35] prevailing amen because he wrestled with
[19:38] and he overcame
[19:41] but he had to do it alone his wives
[19:43] couldn't go with him his servants
[19:44] couldn't go with him nobody could go
[19:46] with him and here jesus he even wants to
[19:49] bring three of his disciples amen to
[19:51] watch with him and to pray with him and
[19:54] to support him in his hour amen and
[19:56] they're falling asleep they can't even
[19:58] stay awake and the lord is disappointed
[20:01] he's asking the question could you not
[20:03] even watch with me one hour
[20:08] this is something he's going to have to
[20:10] do alone
[20:13] then he says in verse 41 watch and pray
[20:17] that you enter not into
[20:19] the spirit indeed is willing but the
[20:21] flesh is weak
[20:23] and he went away again the second time
[20:25] and prayed saying o my father if this
[20:28] cup may not pass away from me except i
[20:30] drink it thy will be done
[20:33] he already said that once
[20:35] now he's going through it again
[20:40] and he came and he found them asleep
[20:42] again for their eyes were heavy
[20:45] now listen i i hope that the bible
[20:48] becomes real to us i hope that under
[20:50] this message the prophet of god made
[20:52] this bible real amen it's not a fairy
[20:54] tale it's not a story you have to
[20:56] imagine jesus he's going off by himself
[20:59] he's so heavy he's so sorrowful that
[21:01] they could tell after the last supper
[21:03] they could tell his countenance was down
[21:06] that he was under a heavy load amen he
[21:08] goes to the garden and he says you all
[21:10] wait here and he brings three of his
[21:12] closest companions three of his best
[21:15] friends on earth three of the
[21:16] individuals that was closer to him than
[21:18] anybody else and he goes away separate
[21:21] with them and says watch with me my soul
[21:24] is exceedingly sorrowful unto death
[21:26] watch with me
[21:29] and he goes and he prays to god amen and
[21:31] he pours out his heart to god and said
[21:33] god can this cup pass from me
[21:36] but not my will yours and he comes back
[21:38] to them why does he come back to them
[21:40] why doesn't he keep praying to god amen
[21:43] this is just my personal opinion but
[21:45] under that heavy burden he's looking for
[21:47] comfort
[21:50] he comes to them he says couldn't you
[21:52] wait with me one hour pray pray that you
[21:54] don't enter into temptation
[21:56] then he goes and he repeats a part of
[22:00] what he just said to god god if this cup
[22:02] if this cup cannot pass from me amen if
[22:05] it be your will then let it be your will
[22:07] not mine and that he goes back to his
[22:09] friends again
[22:12] just look at this friends look at this
[22:14] and live through it with the lord
[22:18] he comes back again and he finds them
[22:20] asleep he is all alone in the world amen
[22:24] and he's the weight of what has to
[22:26] happen the weight of the fulfillment of
[22:27] the word is right upon him and he's
[22:30] wrestling here in gethsemane
[22:33] and nobody can wrestle with him
[22:38] comes the second time
[22:41] finds them asleep
[22:44] goes back
[22:46] verse 44
[22:48] and he left them and went away again and
[22:50] prayed the third time saying the same
[22:53] words
[22:54] then cometh he to his disciples so the
[22:56] third time he said the same thing he
[22:58] said the second time
[23:01] but why is he keep repeating the same
[23:03] thing
[23:05] think about it think about it
[23:08] why is he going back again because he is
[23:12] under such a burden he would love if god
[23:16] would say you don't have to do that
[23:19] he would love if the father would change
[23:22] the word for him
[23:25] if you've never been there i promise you
[23:27] at some point in your life you're going
[23:29] to get there
[23:30] where you would love for god to alter
[23:32] the word for you that you're going to
[23:34] have to make a stand or make a decision
[23:36] on the word that is going to grieve you
[23:38] or cost you there's going to be some
[23:40] price to pay to stay with the word and
[23:42] if you've not come there yet you're
[23:44] probably going to come there before you
[23:45] get out of here and nobody can go there
[23:47] with you but you're going to have to
[23:49] surrender and i'm telling you when you
[23:51] get to that time i would imagine that
[23:53] you're going to keep checking with god
[23:54] god are you sure this is the only way
[23:57] are you sure there's no other way and
[24:00] you you may try to talk to friends and
[24:01] get them to pray with you you may call a
[24:03] bunch of people and say will you pray
[24:05] with me but they can never bear this
[24:07] burden with you there's a burden of the
[24:09] fulfillment of the word in your life
[24:11] that you're the only one that can bear
[24:13] that burden
[24:17] you're going to come face to face with
[24:19] the word
[24:21] and you're listen you're going to ask
[24:24] the lord is there any other way
[24:28] you know we talk about being the bride
[24:31] and fulfilling the word and there's a
[24:33] blessing that goes with it amen but it's
[24:35] it can almost sometimes be like a pep
[24:38] rally like a a cheerleader type thing
[24:42] we're going to keep the word we're not
[24:43] going to fail in the word but when jesus
[24:45] kept the word and when he didn't fail by
[24:47] the word it wasn't a pep rally it was a
[24:49] groaning under under the spirit it was a
[24:51] wrestling with his own will it was a
[24:54] being exceedingly sorrowful unto death
[24:56] when he come to time to fulfill what he
[24:58] was born for when he come to the moment
[25:00] where all the prophecies in his life
[25:02] were going to come to be fulfilled he
[25:03] was the chosen vessel he was the one
[25:05] redemption was resting on his shoulders
[25:07] he didn't skip to it friends he had to
[25:10] die
[25:11] he had to die to his will he had to die
[25:13] to himself he had to die to his loves he
[25:16] had to die to his preferences
[25:22] and we wonder sometimes why it's so hard
[25:25] it was hard for the lord
[25:30] and he comes again
[25:31] father
[25:33] if this cup can't pass by me unless i
[25:35] drink of it thy will not mine listen you
[25:38] would think you would think that the
[25:41] only begotten son of god could just say
[25:42] lord if this is what you want that's
[25:44] good enough for me i'm fine let's go
[25:45] okay
[25:47] i'm ready for calvary
[25:51] that's sometimes how we act
[25:55] like we can do this we got this there's
[25:57] a prophecy in my life
[26:00] watch out devil here i come
[26:04] but when jesus come to the fulfillment
[26:06] of the word
[26:07] it was going to cost him everything
[26:12] he knew what price he was going to pay
[26:14] and as he was wrestling with his own
[26:16] will he was he was prevailing in
[26:19] gethsemane
[26:24] i don't mean to preach heavy
[26:27] i i want to i want to have a pep rally
[26:29] every service and let's walk out of here
[26:31] we're going to get him go fight go lions
[26:35] eagles charge
[26:39] but this is the example we have
[26:42] this is the reality of the word when
[26:44] brother branham come to terms with who
[26:46] he was it didn't cause him skipping
[26:48] through the garden it was a heaviness
[26:50] there was a burden that come with
[26:51] carrying the word there was a burden
[26:53] that came with bringing the seals when
[26:55] he said this will cost 10 000 of my
[26:57] friends to leave me he suffered
[26:59] rejection he suffered terribly and even
[27:02] when he tried to exert his own will to
[27:04] get away from the pressure and away from
[27:06] the rejection he was going to go up into
[27:08] alaska and deceive his wife and and and
[27:11] god began to rebuke him and all he was
[27:14] trying to do was get away from the
[27:15] pressure and get away from the grief
[27:21] he said i'm all cut up on the inside
[27:24] from fighting a lot of hard battles
[27:28] what was he a chosen vessel
[27:30] predestinated to be elijah
[27:34] but what kind of prevailing did that
[27:37] prophet have to go through
[27:39] what kind of wrestling did he have to
[27:41] wrestle with
[27:43] to bring forth the word and manifest the
[27:45] word in his life
[27:47] what kind of stand did he have to take
[27:49] what kind of rejection did he have to
[27:51] face what what about all his friends
[27:54] could you watch with me pray with me
[27:58] he's the only one
[28:00] that can make this kind of surrender
[28:07] he says
[28:08] verse 44 again
[28:09] and he left them and went away again and
[28:11] prayed the third time saying the same
[28:13] words then cometh he to his disciples
[28:16] and saith unto them sleep on now
[28:18] and take your rest
[28:20] behold the hours at hand
[28:22] the son of man is betrayed into the
[28:23] hands of sinners
[28:25] i think 45 is when we see him overcome
[28:32] look at verse 45
[28:35] sleep on now
[28:38] take your rest
[28:41] i've settled into my own heart
[28:45] he's not asking them to pray he's not
[28:47] rebuking them for not staying up with
[28:49] him he's not going back and forth to god
[28:51] anymore he's not asking a fourth time a
[28:53] fifth time
[28:54] i believe personally this is brother
[28:56] chad that verse 45 shows where he
[29:00] prevailed
[29:04] sleep on
[29:05] it's okay
[29:07] i'm not asking you to pray anymore i've
[29:08] already settled it in my hearts
[29:11] i chose this path and i'm walking it of
[29:13] my own choosing
[29:18] now he wasn't looking to anybody else to
[29:20] help him
[29:22] he wasn't looking to change god's mind
[29:24] he wasn't checking in with him again to
[29:26] see if maybe he had changed since the
[29:27] last time
[29:29] he wasn't in this turmoil he wasn't
[29:33] in this point of decision now listen
[29:35] when you come to the decisions like
[29:37] these kind of decisions amen it'll
[29:39] absolutely wreck your life tear your
[29:41] stomach up your heart will be bleeding
[29:43] within your stomach will be churning
[29:45] your nerves will be tense
[29:49] you're coming to make this decision but
[29:51] once you submit to the will of god and
[29:53] surrender there's a peace that always
[29:55] comes
[29:57] knowing you'll face rejection knowing
[29:59] that that people will misunderstand your
[30:01] choice knowing that they won't
[30:03] understand they won't comprehend knowing
[30:05] all of that there's something that comes
[30:07] over amen the desperate wrestling is
[30:09] over now it's time to just go do what
[30:12] i've surrendered myself to do
[30:16] like i said if you have an experience
[30:17] that you will
[30:19] i don't think anybody gets to bypass
[30:21] this
[30:25] brother brahms said and the message show
[30:27] us the father and it will satisfy us in
[30:29] 1959.
[30:30] he said you believe god's in his son
[30:33] god's in his universe god's in his word
[30:36] god is in his son now is god in his
[30:38] people
[30:39] the death of christ was to sanctify a
[30:42] church that he might work through and
[30:43] continue his work there had to be an
[30:45] atonement made in his body the man jesus
[30:48] was made a sacrifice willingly
[30:51] like we take take it through this last
[30:53] week in a type of isaac willingly
[30:55] submitted himself to death
[30:56] he didn't have to die
[30:59] he said no man takes my life i lay it
[31:01] down
[31:02] let's look at that in john chapter 10
[31:04] together
[31:05] let's turn to john chapter 10 quickly
[31:15] john chapter 10 verse 17.
[31:21] therefore doth does my father love me
[31:25] because i lay down my life
[31:27] that i might take it again
[31:30] he's saying
[31:31] this has even caused for my father to
[31:33] love me
[31:36] like
[31:37] you can say he'll love me at all costs
[31:41] but jesus was saying therefore does my
[31:43] father love me
[31:46] because i laid down my life
[31:48] that i might take it again
[31:51] no man takes it from me but i lay it
[31:53] down of myself
[31:56] i have power to lay it down i have power
[31:58] to take it again this commandment have i
[32:01] received of my father
[32:05] jesus knew this before gethsemane
[32:09] jesus also knew that if you destroy this
[32:12] temple in three days i'll raise it up he
[32:14] knew that before it gets so many
[32:16] he also knew that the chief elders and
[32:19] chief priests would take him and evenly
[32:21] mistreat him and kill him before
[32:24] gethsemane
[32:25] he knew the prophecies he knew the word
[32:27] he was the word
[32:29] he knew it all but when it came down to
[32:31] it he had to die and wrestle in
[32:34] gethsemane to take that will of his and
[32:36] submit it to the will of the father
[32:39] but he said therefore that the father
[32:41] loving me
[32:42] because i laid down my life
[32:45] for the sheep
[32:46] brother bam said in conference 1961
[32:49] let's get to one another
[32:51] it's called the gethsemane conference
[32:53] there was a terrible conference he
[32:55] didn't have to die a young man he didn't
[32:58] have to do it but when he seen lost
[33:00] humanity his condition said not my will
[33:02] but thine be done brother benham is
[33:04] clear on this that jesus didn't have to
[33:07] die meaning that he was not sin born he
[33:10] was not born like you and i he didn't
[33:12] have to die and he was not forced to die
[33:18] you say but the word says according to
[33:20] the word he had to die but he was never
[33:23] forced to surrender his life he had to
[33:25] do that of his own choosing
[33:30] 1962 forsaking all what else did jesus
[33:33] do he gave and forsook his own life he
[33:35] gave his life to save yours and mine
[33:38] because that's he gave his life he
[33:40] didn't have to lay it down he done it
[33:42] willingly he didn't have to do it but
[33:45] he'd done it willingly because he he
[33:46] could so he could save you
[33:49] in the fifth seal 1963 he says there
[33:52] couldn't have been a mortal being suffer
[33:54] like that until his own grief separated
[33:56] his water from his blood and his veins
[33:58] before he went to calvary drops of blood
[33:59] was coming from his body with such grief
[34:02] and broken heart
[34:03] and what he had to do but could have
[34:05] refused it
[34:08] this is in the fifth seal
[34:10] but could have refused it
[34:12] to but willingly did it for you and i
[34:17] see jesus could have run away
[34:20] he knew judas was betraying him
[34:23] he said so at the last supper he told
[34:26] judas to go do what he must do do it
[34:28] quickly he said the son of man will be
[34:30] betrayed by by one of his fellows he
[34:32] knew it was coming amen he could have
[34:34] run away and hid amen but he was
[34:36] wrestling now in gethsemane he was
[34:38] staying put he was asking god he was
[34:41] laying right there and saying oh god oh
[34:43] god oh god going to his friends coming
[34:45] back to god until finally he said rest
[34:47] it's okay the son of man is betrayed
[34:52] but i want to make this clear where
[34:54] brother ben said he didn't have to die
[34:58] he could have refused it
[35:01] meaning jesus christ was put on free
[35:03] moral agency
[35:07] because
[35:09] the first adam was put on free moral
[35:11] agency
[35:13] and the first adam
[35:15] in the garden was not willing to do what
[35:18] jesus was willing to do in the garden of
[35:20] gethsemane
[35:23] and he exerted his own will and took
[35:26] back his wife and we know it all plays
[35:28] in amen to god's great drama amen but
[35:31] free moral agency caused the first fall
[35:33] in the garden of eden caused everything
[35:35] to be lost so now god is going to use
[35:38] the exact same mechanism in the last
[35:40] adam to start bringing back redemption
[35:43] and it had to be by free moral agency it
[35:46] could not be by force but it had to be
[35:49] by free moral agency
[35:51] so jesus was not forced to calvary
[35:56] this is this is this gets really
[35:58] important so i want you to pay close
[36:00] attention he was not forced to calvary
[36:02] but he did so willingly he was not
[36:05] forced he he gave of his own life he
[36:07] chose he surrendered to god because that
[36:10] was the only way that he could bring
[36:12] back redemption to reverse what was done
[36:15] in the garden of eden is now he was
[36:17] going to have to exercise his own free
[36:19] moral agency god was not forcing him god
[36:22] was not making him amen but he laid down
[36:25] his life for the sheep
[36:32] that's an important principle so hold on
[36:34] to that we'll get more to more of that
[36:36] in a minute but let's go to first john
[36:41] first john
[36:43] chapter 3.
[36:54] first john 3 and 16
[36:57] hereby perceive we the love of god
[36:59] because he laid down his life for us
[37:02] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[37:04] the brethren
[37:06] so he's saying what he did we should do
[37:09] brother benham the message leadership
[37:12] he said each one of us has to make a
[37:14] choice and it's confronting to us that
[37:16] we're all confronted with this one thing
[37:19] what are we going to do about eternal
[37:21] life we're going to live here after or
[37:23] not then we have to come to jesus to get
[37:25] that the opportunity of choosing that's
[37:27] one thing god gave us he don't force
[37:30] something on us
[37:32] he just lets us make our own choice so
[37:34] you have to you have to not be forced
[37:38] but just make your own choice
[37:41] this is such an important principle
[37:44] that we have to get down to terms of the
[37:46] with this
[37:48] because jesus when he come down to it he
[37:51] had to make his own choice you and i
[37:53] when we come down to it to make his own
[37:55] choice and i believe that i'm just as
[37:57] predestinated as he was
[38:00] and i believe there's prophecy speaking
[38:02] of me overcoming an end time just like
[38:04] there was prophecies of him overcoming
[38:06] in the end time
[38:08] and i believe i'm part of the word the
[38:09] same as he's part of the word
[38:13] but that doesn't mean that that that
[38:16] it's going to be different for me than
[38:17] it was for him he had to lay down his
[38:19] own life and make his own choice and now
[38:21] we're being asked to surrender our own
[38:23] will and lay down our own life to take
[38:26] the father's will and god's not going to
[38:28] force us into it and there's so many
[38:30] times that we are thinking and asking
[38:32] and expecting god to do everything
[38:36] we are acting as if well you know i'm
[38:38] predestinating not to fall i can't fall
[38:40] when i'm telling your friends that you
[38:42] can fall daily amen there's a prophecy
[38:45] that the elect of god will not fall
[38:47] ultimately
[38:51] you understand that
[38:53] we'll not fall ultimately the pre these
[38:55] predestinated not to but you take that
[38:58] attitude and i'm sure that you're going
[39:00] to experience a fall
[39:03] in a correction
[39:04] because god he's he's not going to force
[39:07] you so we we would love it if god would
[39:10] rearrange all the obstacles we never
[39:11] have to make a hard choice and never
[39:13] have a separation over the word amen
[39:15] never have to have be rejected because
[39:16] of our choice of the word we would
[39:18] absolutely love that we would say god
[39:20] let me bypass this make it to where i
[39:22] don't have to say anything make it to
[39:23] where i don't have to make a choice oh
[39:25] god can you rearrange it all
[39:28] and he's not touching anything amen
[39:31] because he's asking you to make your
[39:32] choice on the word amen
[39:37] and we keep going back to him will you
[39:39] rearrange it will you change is there
[39:41] any other way and he doesn't do anything
[39:45] and we say oh god you know if you'll
[39:48] just come down and anoint me to do it
[39:52] well i want to tell you something the
[39:54] anointing left jesus when it was time to
[39:56] do it
[40:01] when god let jesus make his choice and
[40:05] march to calvary he removed the
[40:07] anointing amen so he would have to go of
[40:10] his own choosing
[40:14] and when we go to make touches oh god
[40:16] just do it just just speak and he's
[40:19] saying you speak you've got the word
[40:22] what's your choice
[40:29] i've just
[40:32] i would like to say this
[40:35] i don't think
[40:37] being the bride will be as easy as most
[40:41] people thought it would be
[40:46] i don't think the bride that'll have
[40:49] victory over death of the end time
[40:53] that'll see the
[40:54] fullness of redemption come in the
[40:56] change of her atoms
[40:58] i do not believe it will be as easy as
[41:01] we expected
[41:04] and i do not believe it will be as easy
[41:06] as we've acted like
[41:10] i do not believe it will happen without
[41:12] our gethsemanes
[41:24] in 1965 who is this melchizedek
[41:28] brother says notice after the battle was
[41:30] over melchizedek served his victorious
[41:32] child communion
[41:33] think of that part of himself
[41:36] now we want to see here in time in the
[41:38] view of communion after the battle he
[41:40] gave of himself because the communion is
[41:42] part of christ
[41:43] and after the struggle is over
[41:45] after you've done got yourself whipped
[41:48] out
[41:49] what are you struggling with
[41:51] you're struggling with your nature
[41:53] you're struggling with your will you're
[41:55] struggling with your own thinking you're
[41:57] struggling with what jesus struggled
[41:59] with in gethsemane you're struggling but
[42:01] after you've struggled and you've
[42:03] battled it out and you've got yourself
[42:05] all whipped out
[42:08] they become part of his being you get it
[42:11] jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't
[42:13] turn him loose until he blessed him
[42:15] that's right battled for life
[42:18] and after the battle is over then god
[42:21] gives you of himself
[42:24] that is the true communion the little
[42:26] bread and wafer just represents it you
[42:28] shouldn't take it unless you've wrestled
[42:29] it out and become part of god
[42:33] brotherhood was telling us that
[42:35] melchizedek when melchizedek come on the
[42:37] scene to serve bread and wine he did it
[42:39] after abraham had battled it out after
[42:42] the battle was over and brother man
[42:43] types that right back he said after
[42:45] you've wrestled it out after you've
[42:47] battled it out and got yourself all
[42:48] whipped out and become part of his being
[42:51] then he gives you of himself
[42:54] and we
[42:55] we want god to do everything and god has
[42:57] already done everything
[43:02] well we want god he but he's already
[43:04] done everything he's already provided a
[43:06] lamb that blood has already been spilled
[43:08] he's already given his word he's already
[43:11] promised to be with you and to the end
[43:12] of the world he has already given
[43:14] everything now it's our turn to give of
[43:17] ourselves
[43:22] let's go to first corinthians
[43:25] chapter 9.
[43:41] first corinthians chapter 9
[43:44] verse 24
[43:48] know you not that they which run in a
[43:50] race run all
[43:52] but one receiveth the prize
[43:55] so run that you may obtain
[43:57] and every man that striveth for the
[43:59] mastery is temperate has self-control
[44:02] temperate in all things now they do it
[44:03] to obtain a corruptable crown but we
[44:07] unincorruptable
[44:09] now is paul in this race talking about
[44:12] what god's supposed to be doing
[44:14] or he's talking about his part
[44:18] he's got self-control he's temperate in
[44:20] all things he's running to obtain a
[44:22] prize he's taking control of himself
[44:25] they do it for a corruptable but we for
[44:27] an incorruptable
[44:28] then he says in verse 26 i therefore so
[44:31] run not as uncertain shall fight i not
[44:33] as one that beateth the air but i keep
[44:35] under my body and bring it into
[44:37] subjection
[44:38] lest that by any means when i have
[44:40] preached to others i myself should be a
[44:42] cast away
[44:45] paul was not asking god to bring his
[44:48] flesh into subjection to the word
[44:52] paul was saying i do that
[44:55] is that what paul said
[44:57] i'm not adding words to am i or am i
[44:59] just reading what he said and when he
[45:01] says i keep under my body if you look
[45:03] that up in the concordance it says to
[45:05] beat black and blue
[45:07] to afflict too weary
[45:10] that's what the concordance just look up
[45:12] strong corners it's what it says keep
[45:13] under my body
[45:15] and and bring it listen and bring it
[45:18] into subjection that subjection means
[45:21] bring it into slavery
[45:24] i take this body that's corruptible
[45:26] that's trying to sleep me the wrong way
[45:28] and i weary it i wear it out i beat it
[45:31] black and blue and bring it into slavery
[45:33] amen so that it obey the word of god
[45:37] paul was not
[45:39] paul was not asking the lord to do that
[45:41] he was telling us what he did
[45:44] and telling us what we should do
[45:48] in perfect strength by perfect weakness
[45:50] brother man says i've often said the
[45:52] greatest enemy i got is william branham
[45:55] he's the one that gets in god's way he's
[45:58] the one that gets lazy he's the one that
[46:00] gets to a place sometimes where he
[46:02] thinks he can do something about it and
[46:03] when he does that shoves god right out
[46:05] of the picture but when i can get rid of
[46:08] that guy
[46:09] when i get to a place that he's out of
[46:11] the way then god can come over and do
[46:13] things that william branham knows
[46:14] nothing about
[46:16] what was william branham wrestling with
[46:18] his own flesh his own self amen bringing
[46:21] it into subjection subduing it bringing
[46:23] in the bondage and the slavery and
[46:25] wearing it beating it black and blue
[46:27] blue and when he can get it out of the
[46:28] way and surrender to god god can do
[46:30] things that that man can never do
[46:34] that's when god can use you that's when
[46:36] he can use
[46:37] any of you you can you can he can use
[46:40] anybody when we get out of the way
[46:46] now brother-in-law says it makes an
[46:47] interesting quote here in satan's eden
[46:50] and i want to spend a few minutes on
[46:51] this
[46:53] he says
[46:55] after the millennium's over then they'll
[46:56] be established eden again god's great
[46:59] kingdom will be taken back because jesus
[47:02] fought it out with satan in the garden
[47:04] of gethsemane and won back eden
[47:09] listen what the prophet said
[47:11] when he battled it out with satan in the
[47:13] garden of gethsemane amen how did he
[47:16] battle that with satan amen there was no
[47:18] man there with a fork stick and and and
[47:21] and uh horns on his head amen what he
[47:24] was doing is there was a temptation
[47:26] coming to him amen to exert his own will
[47:28] to run away from this plan of god and he
[47:31] was surrendering himself to god and when
[47:33] he was battling it out he was battling
[47:35] it out with
[47:36] satan when he battled it out and
[47:39] surrendered himself in gethsemane when
[47:41] he wrestled and overcame in gethsemane
[47:44] brother branham says he won back eden
[47:49] so he won back eden when he surrendered
[47:53] his will to the will of god amen he gave
[47:56] a full surrender willingly not by force
[48:00] not what god did what he did
[48:04] and when he surrendered willingly and
[48:06] gave up his will he won back eden how
[48:09] was eden lost eden lost when the
[48:12] temptation of the devil caused man to
[48:14] exert his own will over the will of god
[48:17] how was eden won eden was one when a man
[48:19] would subdue his own will and come
[48:22] subject to the will of god so the way it
[48:24] was lost is the way it was won
[48:28] you see the way god keeps everything in
[48:30] equity and see the way god works amen if
[48:33] free moral agency was a powerful agent
[48:36] to throw the whole world into chaos and
[48:38] cause man to lose its inheritance then
[48:40] it has to be a powerful enough agent to
[48:43] win it all back
[48:46] does that make sense if it was powerful
[48:49] enough to cause to fall then it must be
[48:51] powerful enough to bring redemption
[48:56] and god had never yet had a man on the
[48:58] earth that would fully surrender his
[49:00] whole will to god amen everyone that was
[49:03] tried at some point failed david found
[49:05] moses failed every one of them failed at
[49:07] some point but he finally comes to a man
[49:10] amen who completely rings out and
[49:12] surrenders everything and in gethsemane
[49:14] he wins back eden
[49:17] he wins back to right
[49:19] and then at calvary he pays the price to
[49:21] purchase it
[49:23] he won it back before he paid for it
[49:27] amen
[49:29] he won it back in eden what was
[49:31] happening the last adam was now battling
[49:34] it out in his hour of temptation he was
[49:36] facing the tame same temptation that
[49:38] every son of god has faced from the time
[49:40] of adam on amen will you fully surrender
[49:43] to the will of god or will you take your
[49:45] own will even in one matter
[49:50] and there was a son of god on the earth
[49:52] this time that was not sin born amen
[49:55] that was not going to go the same way he
[49:56] was predestinated not to and because he
[49:59] was predestinated not to there was an
[50:01] ability there but he had to exercise his
[50:04] own will his own free moral agency
[50:09] and when he did that he won back what
[50:12] the first adam lost
[50:16] then he laid down his life and went to
[50:17] calvary to pay the price for what he had
[50:21] already won
[50:29] see
[50:33] the thought that i've been dwelling on
[50:35] the meditation that's been in my heart
[50:38] is the power of free choice
[50:44] brother bram talks about this as free
[50:45] moral agency or free choice he speaks
[50:47] about it through the entire message
[50:51] and he shows that man was put on free
[50:53] moral agency
[50:55] and
[50:56] and it really it really goes back
[50:58] further than that because lucifer and
[51:00] the angels had a choice
[51:04] and lucifer the angels made their
[51:06] choice so free choice free moral agency
[51:10] free choice caused the fallen heaven the
[51:13] disruption of heaven
[51:16] then free choice caused the disruption
[51:18] of earth amen of
[51:20] eden
[51:22] so my question is
[51:24] if free choice caused the fall what will
[51:27] he use for redemption
[51:30] what power is there in free choice
[51:34] and brother branham said god set it up
[51:36] this way this is god's setup he said it
[51:39] this way for a reason
[51:41] and brother behind said in god's only
[51:42] provided place of worship he said he had
[51:45] in his heart before the foundation of
[51:46] the world a son
[51:48] because he's a father but it was still
[51:51] in the genes of his word and he created
[51:53] a man and he had to put him on free
[51:55] moral agency but that man fell
[51:57] but the great sculptor god who made man
[51:59] from the dust of the earth he didn't
[52:00] settle for that he started making man
[52:03] again and he made noah he died drunk he
[52:05] made moses that failed to keep his word
[52:08] he made profits that run in the time of
[52:10] trouble and he kept building and molding
[52:12] until after a while he wanted a
[52:14] masterpiece to reflect him his nature
[52:17] what was in his heart what a son should
[52:19] be
[52:21] so god had a in his heart what a son
[52:24] should be amen and the first son adam
[52:28] failed to manifest what was in god's
[52:29] heart for a son to be but this one that
[52:32] he made when he rebuilt the masterpiece
[52:34] and he rebuilt it all the way back till
[52:36] he comes to jesus christ himself and he
[52:38] was reflecting in him what god had in
[52:41] his heart what he wanted a son to be
[52:43] totally submissive completely uh
[52:46] completely given over to the will of the
[52:48] father completely surrendering his own
[52:50] life to fulfill the will of the father
[52:52] that was the idea of what god wanted in
[52:54] the son
[52:57] and he was going to use that son to
[52:59] redeem
[53:00] what had been lost
[53:03] and satan's eaten again
[53:06] brother bram says
[53:08] satan has succeeded in perverting and
[53:10] taking over this world and making his
[53:12] kingdom
[53:13] that man was put on
[53:15] by free moral agency to choose for
[53:17] themselves what kind of life they
[53:19] desired
[53:20] and that shows what's in your heart
[53:25] your choice you know what your actions
[53:27] speak so loud it drowns out your voice
[53:33] brother branham said that that
[53:36] free moral agency god set it up on free
[53:38] moral agency that man could choose for
[53:41] themselves
[53:44] and that shows what's in your heart
[53:48] so god has
[53:49] this mechanism of free choice
[53:53] and free choice has a huge power
[53:56] associated with it
[54:00] you know all the time we're talking
[54:01] about power power power and the truth
[54:04] power for this power for that power i'm
[54:06] telling you the greatest power that has
[54:08] been given to you is the power to choose
[54:11] the word
[54:14] i can't think of a greater power amen
[54:16] jesus had all kinds of powers but in
[54:19] order to come to redemption he didn't
[54:21] use any of his powers to come through
[54:23] redemption what he did is he used the
[54:26] power of free choice to give up his will
[54:29] and choose the father's will and when he
[54:31] exercised that power of free choice that
[54:34] power of free choice paid the price of
[54:36] redemption for you and i
[54:40] to ultimately reverse the curse that was
[54:42] put upon us when the first adam made his
[54:44] free choice
[54:47] so we
[54:48] you know if you want to talk about power
[54:52] let's get down to real power
[54:57] you know so we we we go so often crazy
[55:01] directions and and talk about things
[55:04] that are just foolish
[55:07] just to make ourselves feel good we've
[55:09] got power we're this and we're that
[55:11] we're that when god gave him the holy
[55:13] ghost he gave him power by the holy
[55:14] ghost to be his witnesses
[55:19] and there's a power
[55:20] that he's given with free choice and
[55:22] that free choice has a power to
[55:25] determine your eternal destination
[55:32] now he did this
[55:35] and he set it up because your choice
[55:38] shows what's in your heart
[55:41] and now this free moral agency
[55:44] it'll begin
[55:46] it'll begin
[55:48] to restore man back to god
[55:52] because my free choice to express
[55:54] there's a son of god
[55:56] there's the son of god
[55:58] there's the son of god because the
[56:00] choice they makes begins to reflect
[56:02] what's on the inside of them when they
[56:04] choose the word and surrender themselves
[56:06] and choose the word and surrender
[56:07] themselves it begins to reflect what's
[56:09] actually on the inside they're not in
[56:12] this life just to gain we're not here
[56:14] just to fulfill our own purpose we're
[56:16] not here just to have a pleasurable life
[56:18] and have it easy and everything easy but
[56:20] when you begin to express what's on the
[56:22] inside by coming to obstacles and taking
[56:24] the word amen by coming to rejection and
[56:27] taking the word as you keep taking the
[56:29] word you're reflecting what's on the
[56:30] inside
[56:32] demonstrating
[56:34] your children of god
[56:39] let's go to genesis chapter 3.
[56:55] genesis chapter 3 verse 4
[56:57] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[56:59] shall not surely die for god to know
[57:01] that in the day you eat thereof then
[57:03] your eyes shall be opened and you shall
[57:05] be as gods knowing good and evil
[57:08] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[57:10] good for food and then it was pleasant
[57:12] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[57:14] make one wise she took of the fruit
[57:16] thereof and did eat and gave also into
[57:18] her husband with her
[57:20] and he did eat
[57:21] and the eyes of them both were open and
[57:23] they knew that they were naked and they
[57:24] sewed fig leaves together
[57:26] and made themselves aprons
[57:30] all the way back in the garden
[57:32] the serpent now
[57:34] begins to tempt the woman and the woman
[57:37] under the temptation she begins to look
[57:38] at the tree and she notices the tree
[57:41] that it was good for food
[57:44] that it was a pleasant to the eyes
[57:47] and the tree to be desired to make one
[57:48] wise
[57:50] those
[57:51] every one of those things are
[57:54] self-fulfilling
[57:57] self-rewarding
[58:00] so
[58:01] all the way back in the garden when the
[58:04] woman was tempted
[58:06] she was tempted with her own desire
[58:09] versus the will of god
[58:11] versus the word of god
[58:13] and god's word is his will so it goes
[58:15] all the way back to the beginning and
[58:17] when she's enticed she's drawn away of
[58:20] her own lust and enticed amen she begins
[58:22] to look at this tree and it's desirable
[58:25] it's good for food that's for her his
[58:27] desire will make her wise that's for her
[58:29] amen
[58:30] it's all for her and so now she
[58:34] she is willingly deceived because she's
[58:37] wanting what she's seeing
[58:41] and she's not willing to lay down her
[58:43] own want her own desire to stick with
[58:46] the word of god she now begins to see
[58:48] this as good this is right we should do
[58:50] this but it's in according to her own
[58:52] will her own desire
[58:55] so all the way back it was a desire of a
[58:58] person over the word of god
[59:02] and her choice reflected what she really
[59:05] wanted what she really wanted brother
[59:07] bam said she wanted to know about this
[59:09] thing she really wanted to know what it
[59:10] was
[59:12] and so when she was enticed she really
[59:15] wanted to know but instead of just
[59:16] giving up all knowledge and all
[59:18] understanding and staying with the word
[59:20] amen she was entitled amen and led away
[59:22] of her own lusts
[59:25] and i'd just like to say this if god now
[59:29] has restored back the last adam and the
[59:31] last adam now made a choice
[59:35] will there have to be a woman that makes
[59:37] her choice
[59:41] in the beginning in the fall first the
[59:44] woman made her choice then the man made
[59:46] his choice
[59:48] the woman made her choice for adultery
[59:50] then the man made his choice to take her
[59:52] back
[59:54] is that true
[59:56] she made her choice he made his choice
[59:58] now we come down through the last adam's
[1:00:00] been restored and now the man made his
[1:00:03] choice first this time
[1:00:07] now he made his choice first what have
[1:00:10] we been waiting on why when he made his
[1:00:12] choice amen why wasn't it all over
[1:00:15] because we've got to restore back amen
[1:00:17] and there's a law of free choice here
[1:00:19] the man has made his choice and i
[1:00:22] believe the woman has to make her choice
[1:00:26] and we've come to the hour for the the
[1:00:28] woman to make her choice to surrender
[1:00:31] her life to lay it all down and choose
[1:00:33] the word and the word only amen to
[1:00:37] surrender everything else to the
[1:00:38] headship of the word which is her
[1:00:40] husband amen and not take any other word
[1:00:43] not take any other idea no matter how
[1:00:45] difficult it is no matter how how much
[1:00:48] we want it or don't want it amen it's
[1:00:50] time to throw all of that away there's
[1:00:52] time amen in the redemption cycle for
[1:00:55] there to be a woman if there was a last
[1:00:57] adam will there be a last woman a last
[1:01:00] eve amen in the cycle of redemption
[1:01:03] will there be a woman on earth that will
[1:01:05] take the word
[1:01:07] that will go through her gethsemane that
[1:01:09] will prevail that will wrestle it out
[1:01:13] and overcome
[1:01:18] brother branham says in desperations
[1:01:20] 1963 he said our dear lord jesus himself
[1:01:24] and the world's great battleground
[1:01:27] gethsemane
[1:01:29] what if brother called guy sent me the
[1:01:30] world's great battleground
[1:01:35] gethsemane he cried out in despair
[1:01:38] should he take the sins of the world or
[1:01:40] should he just remain on earth with his
[1:01:42] beloved disciples
[1:01:44] what he wanted to do
[1:01:47] hear what the prophet said
[1:01:48] jesus wanted to stay on earth with his
[1:01:50] beloved disciples
[1:01:53] that was his will that was his desire
[1:01:55] that's what he wanted to do he did not
[1:01:57] want to separate from them
[1:02:00] he did not want
[1:02:01] his love for them was was holding them
[1:02:04] him to them and them to him
[1:02:07] and that's what he was so grieved about
[1:02:10] he didn't want to separate
[1:02:13] should he take the sins of the world
[1:02:15] what what is this this is the greatest
[1:02:17] battleground gethsemane he cried out in
[1:02:20] despair should he take the sins of the
[1:02:21] world or should he just remain on earth
[1:02:22] with his beloved disciples what he
[1:02:24] wanted to do
[1:02:26] but watch his humility as he humbled
[1:02:28] himself not my will but thine be done
[1:02:30] humbled himself to the word the promised
[1:02:32] word of god of the god of heaven
[1:02:35] notice then he went a little further
[1:02:38] and if we went a little if he went a
[1:02:41] little farther how much more are we to
[1:02:43] go a little farther
[1:02:46] and notice the scripture says here in
[1:02:47] luke that he prayed earnestly brother
[1:02:49] sister if jesus had to pray earnestly
[1:02:52] how much more have we got to pray
[1:02:54] earnestly
[1:02:55] we've been talking about this for some
[1:02:57] time amen that that you know even elijah
[1:03:01] when he prayed earnestly it rained not
[1:03:03] amen there was a fervency and prayer a
[1:03:05] desire and prayer and earnestness and
[1:03:07] prayer and even jesus in order to
[1:03:10] overcome had to pray earnesty he went a
[1:03:13] little further and he prayed more
[1:03:15] earnestly and if jesus had to pray
[1:03:17] earnestly are we going to get it done in
[1:03:19] 30 seconds over coffee before we go to
[1:03:22] work
[1:03:25] but i'm bright i'm chosen i'm
[1:03:27] predestinated
[1:03:29] so was jesus
[1:03:32] he was chosen he was predestinated he
[1:03:35] was the one the prophecies were all
[1:03:37] about he was the fulfillment of the
[1:03:38] prophecies and he agonized amen he
[1:03:41] wrestled it out he prayed fervently if
[1:03:44] he had to pray fervently what do we have
[1:03:46] to do
[1:03:53] he prayed earnestly how much more have
[1:03:55] we got to pray earnestly
[1:03:57] if christ the god of heaven made flesh
[1:03:59] had to pray earnestly how much more are
[1:04:01] we sinners saved by grace to pray
[1:04:03] earnestly if the decision throw the son
[1:04:06] of god into despair what will it do to
[1:04:08] you and i desperately we must cry
[1:04:13] this is why i don't believe that it's
[1:04:15] going to be as easy as we thought it was
[1:04:19] this is why i don't believe it's going
[1:04:21] to be a skipping through the meadows as
[1:04:23] we go
[1:04:25] to the fullness of redemption but i
[1:04:27] think if if there's got to come a test
[1:04:30] amen the bride must be tested on the
[1:04:33] word amen and she must stay with every
[1:04:35] word
[1:04:37] how will that test come oh listen
[1:04:40] friends i would love it if that test
[1:04:42] would come in a tribunal where i stand
[1:04:44] before a panel full of denominational
[1:04:46] ministers and they say if you if you
[1:04:48] don't pass this test we'll take you over
[1:04:50] here and cut your head off i say praise
[1:04:52] god i'll take that but i don't think
[1:04:54] that's the way it's going to come
[1:04:57] i think it's going to come down so
[1:04:59] personal amen i believe it's going to
[1:05:00] come down so personal to you amen it's
[1:05:04] going to be so agonizing to you my
[1:05:06] goodness most of us relish the
[1:05:08] opportunity to tell the whole world what
[1:05:10] we believe and go quickly over have her
[1:05:12] head cut off and go into the sixth
[1:05:14] dimension
[1:05:16] praise god amen go down in a flurry
[1:05:19] friends if you're going to go out go out
[1:05:21] good.
[1:05:27] but i don't think what's going to be
[1:05:29] like this time
[1:05:33] it might be so close it breaks your
[1:05:36] heart
[1:05:39] might be so tight
[1:05:41] you have to make such decisions
[1:05:45] that you you don't want to be here
[1:05:49] you don't want to be making these
[1:05:50] choices
[1:05:52] you don't want to be wrestling this out
[1:05:57] because the
[1:05:58] the bride's got to have the same
[1:05:59] character he has
[1:06:04] the bride's got to be made out of the
[1:06:05] same material he was made out of
[1:06:08] he was the word she has to be the word
[1:06:13] but she's predestinated not to fail
[1:06:17] he was predestinated not to fail
[1:06:22] do you understand
[1:06:26] he was predestinated but he was not
[1:06:28] forced
[1:06:33] he didn't have the full anointing of the
[1:06:35] spirit on him carrying him all the way
[1:06:37] through it left him in gethsemane
[1:06:42] he made his choice
[1:06:44] when he wrestled it out
[1:06:46] are we going to have to make our choice
[1:06:48] as we wrestle it out i believe it's
[1:06:50] happening all the time
[1:06:52] it's happening in relationships it's
[1:06:54] happening in circumstances circumstances
[1:06:56] at work circumstances with family
[1:06:58] circumstances with the world all kinds
[1:07:00] of circumstances are bringing us face to
[1:07:03] face with the word and are we going to
[1:07:04] take the word are we going to take our
[1:07:05] own will are we going to repeat what eve
[1:07:08] did we can't have a repeat of what he
[1:07:10] did this is the last days this is the
[1:07:11] end time we can't have a repeat of the
[1:07:13] church ages
[1:07:16] we can't have any more somebody taking
[1:07:18] their own will or taking the words of a
[1:07:20] man over the word of god we can't have
[1:07:21] that anymore we can't have somebody
[1:07:23] shirking the responsibility and putting
[1:07:25] it off on the ministry we can't have
[1:07:27] that anymore
[1:07:29] we can't anymore have somebody claiming
[1:07:31] ignorance this isn't the age of
[1:07:32] ignorance the seals have been open the
[1:07:34] word has been restored
[1:07:36] we can't have any more somebody just
[1:07:37] sitting on their heels waiting for god
[1:07:39] to do it god's already done it all amen
[1:07:41] he's opened the seals he's given back
[1:07:43] the title deed he's brought the book
[1:07:45] down
[1:07:47] this isn't the time to wait wait for god
[1:07:49] to do something he's done it
[1:07:52] wait for some ministry to do it that's
[1:07:53] not what we're waiting on
[1:07:58] but we're each individually one by one
[1:08:01] being brought face to face with the word
[1:08:03] and we're being tested on what we'll do
[1:08:06] with the word
[1:08:10] and that task i don't believe is going
[1:08:12] to be
[1:08:13] you know
[1:08:14] you stand up before a panel at work and
[1:08:17] says
[1:08:17] if you don't believe in homosexual
[1:08:19] marriage you're fired i say i don't
[1:08:21] believe in homosexual marriage fire me
[1:08:23] please
[1:08:25] i'd love to suffer for his name's sake
[1:08:29] maybe i have a feeling it's going to be
[1:08:30] tighter than that
[1:08:32] i feel like it's going to be more of a
[1:08:33] wrestling match than that
[1:08:36] more of a surrender more of a death to
[1:08:39] self
[1:08:40] more of a showing that she's of the same
[1:08:43] character he's of
[1:08:46] and remember friends
[1:08:48] no matter how tight it gets and how much
[1:08:51] agony that you're under and how how much
[1:08:55] uh how much heartbreak you're under
[1:08:57] just remember if you could just reflect
[1:09:00] back and say i've already done this once
[1:09:04] because when he was in gethsemane i was
[1:09:06] there
[1:09:08] i was with him the bride had not been
[1:09:10] separated from the bridegroom yet they
[1:09:12] were together that's how god knows she
[1:09:14] won't fail she didn't fail there shall
[1:09:17] not fail here
[1:09:20] just as willing as he was when he was
[1:09:22] carrying the attributes of god with him
[1:09:24] to calvary when he was wrestling in
[1:09:26] gethsemane you were there you have no
[1:09:29] knowledge of it amen but you were there
[1:09:31] as part of the word he was the fullness
[1:09:33] of the word wrestling and out when he
[1:09:35] was wrestling it out you were there when
[1:09:37] he was overcoming you were there when he
[1:09:39] went to calvary you were there
[1:09:44] already the word has overcome that means
[1:09:47] for sure in this day the word will
[1:09:50] overcome
[1:09:52] but it'll overcome the same way
[1:09:56] when the vessel that the word is working
[1:09:59] through surrenders itself completely
[1:10:05] the power of free choice has everything
[1:10:07] to do with the threefold purpose of god
[1:10:11] god had one plan and one purpose one
[1:10:13] thing that he wanted to achieve and the
[1:10:15] entire bible had been telling it and all
[1:10:17] the characters have been displaying it
[1:10:19] and that threefold purpose that one plan
[1:10:21] is manifesting a threefold purpose first
[1:10:23] to get pre-eminence in a man what is
[1:10:25] that that's a man fully surrendered to
[1:10:28] the will of god that's preeminence
[1:10:31] he did that in christ jesus second to
[1:10:33] have preeminence and a bride and a
[1:10:34] church and a people he's doing that now
[1:10:37] what is that that's free choice free
[1:10:40] choice has everything to do with the
[1:10:41] threefold purpose of god so god had a
[1:10:43] purpose before the foundation of the
[1:10:45] world and that purpose before the
[1:10:47] foundation of the world is hinged on
[1:10:49] your free choice
[1:10:56] what
[1:10:59] what
[1:11:01] god had a plan before the foundation of
[1:11:03] the world
[1:11:07] and he's depending
[1:11:09] on me
[1:11:10] to make my choice
[1:11:12] for his great plan
[1:11:17] yes
[1:11:19] every attribute of god has to overcome
[1:11:23] by the word
[1:11:25] every part of god has to overcome by the
[1:11:28] word
[1:11:31] we we look at three more like we got
[1:11:33] three more ladies i can choose this and
[1:11:35] i can choose that there's a great power
[1:11:37] that comes with that and a great
[1:11:38] responsibility that comes with that
[1:11:41] that caused the fall in heaven that
[1:11:43] caused the fallen eden
[1:11:45] that caused christ to go to calvary
[1:11:49] to buy back redemption
[1:11:52] the fall
[1:11:53] and redemption
[1:11:55] are moved into place by free choice
[1:11:59] think about that
[1:12:01] the fall
[1:12:02] was brought about by free choice
[1:12:04] redemption is moved into place
[1:12:07] by free choice
[1:12:10] i say god
[1:12:11] help us to choose
[1:12:14] god you know we sing that song i
[1:12:16] surrender all i think we can wake up and
[1:12:18] sing it every morning
[1:12:20] then an hour later we should sing it
[1:12:21] again
[1:12:22] and 30 minutes after that we should sing
[1:12:24] it again because what is he looking for
[1:12:26] in this day to bring the finishing of
[1:12:28] his plan he's looking for preeminence in
[1:12:30] a bride he has to have first place total
[1:12:33] control the headship and the body are
[1:12:35] united and the headship is moving
[1:12:37] through the body because the body is
[1:12:39] completely surrendered to that headship
[1:12:41] to the word
[1:12:43] god
[1:12:44] has to have his way
[1:12:51] i'm going to read this quote i just i
[1:12:52] just made this statement but i want to
[1:12:54] back it up with this quote in the
[1:12:55] message it is the rising of the sun
[1:12:58] he said the spirit left him in the
[1:12:59] garden of gethsemane he had to die a man
[1:13:01] remember friends he didn't have to do
[1:13:03] that
[1:13:04] that was god god anointed that flesh
[1:13:06] which was human flesh
[1:13:08] if he had went up there as god he'd have
[1:13:10] never died that kind of death can't kill
[1:13:12] god but he didn't have to do it
[1:13:15] and remember he went there with you and
[1:13:18] him
[1:13:20] god had never separated the bride from
[1:13:21] the groom yet so when god looked down
[1:13:23] upon the body of christ he saw both male
[1:13:26] and female it was all redeemed in that
[1:13:28] one body they are one same same word the
[1:13:32] same word spoke of the groom speaks of
[1:13:34] the bride
[1:13:38] brother brahm comes to the message the
[1:13:39] unveiling of god
[1:13:42] and in paragraph three or three says
[1:13:44] he died to reveal himself to us
[1:13:48] now let us let us die to self to reveal
[1:13:51] him to others
[1:13:53] let us die to the traditions and things
[1:13:55] to reveal him to the other die to the
[1:13:57] denominations to reveal him
[1:14:01] to others
[1:14:03] he died to reveal himself to us let us
[1:14:05] die to reveal him to others let us
[1:14:07] surrender let us prevail let us wrestle
[1:14:11] with
[1:14:12] and overcome
[1:14:15] oh if i could just get a hold of that
[1:14:16] devil if i could just i'd wring his neck
[1:14:20] i hate statements like that
[1:14:22] you know i hate him because they're
[1:14:23] absolutely foolish
[1:14:27] this creature was full of wisdom the sum
[1:14:29] of beauty was summed up in him he was so
[1:14:31] deceptive he could deceive the angels in
[1:14:33] heaven and you're talking like you could
[1:14:35] go just take him and ring his neck
[1:14:38] and even michael when he was disputing
[1:14:40] with with lucifer over the body over the
[1:14:42] with the devil over the body of moses he
[1:14:44] brought not a railing accusation against
[1:14:46] him but he said the lord deal with thee
[1:14:49] i think it's foolish and childish to
[1:14:51] talk like that
[1:14:54] i think when we talk about you know if i
[1:14:56] could just punch him in the nose if i
[1:14:58] could just ring his neck i grew i grew
[1:15:00] up i grew up in a pentecostal church and
[1:15:03] we talked about the devil like that all
[1:15:05] the time
[1:15:07] while he was deceiving the whole works
[1:15:12] while they were stuck in
[1:15:13] denominationalism and trinitarian
[1:15:14] baptisms and and marriage and re uh
[1:15:17] divorce and remarriage issues running
[1:15:19] rampant through the whole church and
[1:15:20] they were punching the devil and
[1:15:22] wringing his neck and calling him stupid
[1:15:28] i say if you want to ring somebody's
[1:15:30] neck ring your own neck
[1:15:33] if you want to beat somebody down beat
[1:15:35] the same one paul was beating because
[1:15:37] paul was keeping under his body
[1:15:40] he was bringing it into slavery unless
[1:15:42] when he preached to others he himself
[1:15:43] should be a castaway
[1:15:46] paul was not acting silly and foolish
[1:15:48] amen brother bam told us that the
[1:15:50] devil's a worthy adversary because god
[1:15:52] needed a worthy adversary
[1:15:56] let's not talk like little kids amen
[1:15:59] but let's get down to business and say
[1:16:01] really if i want to defeat the devil
[1:16:03] i've got to be defeat the devil in me
[1:16:06] if i'm really going to give him a black
[1:16:08] eye then i've got to lay this flesh down
[1:16:10] so the word can move through this flesh
[1:16:12] that'll give him a black eye if i really
[1:16:14] want to stomp on him what i got to do is
[1:16:16] subdue this outer man and bring it in
[1:16:18] subjection to the word and let the
[1:16:20] spirit of god flow through me to
[1:16:21] manifest the word for the hour and then
[1:16:23] he'll get a black eye then it'll get
[1:16:25] stomped on the head then he'll be
[1:16:27] defeated
[1:16:31] jesus won the victory in gethsemane and
[1:16:33] that wasn't a jumping up and down and
[1:16:35] stomping and calling the devil names
[1:16:39] it was a wrestling with his own will
[1:16:41] looking to his friends for support
[1:16:43] asking god again if this could pass by
[1:16:45] what was he doing he was wrestling it
[1:16:47] all out and he was overcoming and when
[1:16:49] he finally subdued his own flesh when he
[1:16:52] finally subdued his own will he goes
[1:16:54] back to his friends and said take your
[1:16:56] rest asleep
[1:16:57] all is well
[1:16:58] the son of man has already betrayed into
[1:17:01] the hands of sinners
[1:17:03] but it's okay
[1:17:06] oh if the devil ever got a black eye it
[1:17:09] was right there
[1:17:10] if the evil devil ever got stomped on
[1:17:12] the head it was right there amen if he
[1:17:15] ever lost a battle it was right there in
[1:17:17] gethsemane when jesus christ won back
[1:17:20] eden
[1:17:22] and i i'm so tired of hearing rhetoric
[1:17:25] what we need is a life amen we don't
[1:17:27] need words and tap rallies and speech
[1:17:30] what we need is the manifestation of the
[1:17:32] life of jesus christ one who would only
[1:17:34] do the father's will we need a people on
[1:17:36] this earth that will only do the
[1:17:38] father's will
[1:17:41] amen brother bran
[1:17:43] he gives that quote
[1:17:45] and he says what we need now is
[1:17:47] thousands of lived lives that's the
[1:17:49] thunder that shakes the devil
[1:17:51] what is it live lives amen we don't need
[1:17:54] to thunder with our mouths we need to
[1:17:56] thunder with our lives we need to
[1:17:58] surrender we need to take this word and
[1:18:00] put this word on and make everything be
[1:18:03] the word
[1:18:08] we need to
[1:18:10] prevail
[1:18:12] he prevailed
[1:18:14] now it's our turn to prevail
[1:18:17] i want to overcome
[1:18:20] if you want to overcome
[1:18:22] then you need to wrestle
[1:18:25] in your own gethsemane
[1:18:28] with your own will
[1:18:31] if you want to overcome
[1:18:33] you need to
[1:18:34] go and labor in prayer fervently
[1:18:38] and lay down your life to the will and
[1:18:40] word of god
[1:18:47] brother brahm says in christ the mystery
[1:18:48] of god revealed he said predestinated
[1:18:51] there's the mystery
[1:18:53] he before christ or anything else was
[1:18:55] ever on earth you see his great mystery
[1:18:57] that he chose the bride knowing eve
[1:18:59] would fall from disbelieving the word
[1:19:01] knowing that she would fall but he would
[1:19:03] choose a bride that would not fall that
[1:19:05] would hold to the word regardless of
[1:19:07] what all the rest of the world had to
[1:19:08] say about it they would hold to that
[1:19:11] word they are predestinated to stand
[1:19:13] there the adoption of children by jesus
[1:19:16] christ predestinated the church to that
[1:19:18] great glorious
[1:19:20] stand praise god
[1:19:24] we're predestinated if it wasn't for
[1:19:26] predestination it would be impossible
[1:19:31] you cannot choose god unless god has
[1:19:32] first chose you
[1:19:35] you cannot make that stand unless you're
[1:19:37] predestinated to make that stand but
[1:19:39] just because you're predestinated to
[1:19:40] make that sand does not mean it's not
[1:19:42] going to happen without wrestling with
[1:19:44] fervent prayer with sacrifice and a
[1:19:46] laying down of your life
[1:19:48] because that's what happened to jesus
[1:19:50] christ
[1:19:54] he goes on and christ is the mystery of
[1:19:56] god revealed to say denomination won't
[1:19:58] never touch that it's a revelation she
[1:20:00] knows it so did he even know it but she
[1:20:02] fell but this one knows it and won't
[1:20:04] fall she's ordained hallelujah she's
[1:20:07] ordained to not fall she won't fall
[1:20:10] she's predestinated to it
[1:20:13] oh
[1:20:14] praise god
[1:20:17] the next time we get in our wrestling
[1:20:19] match
[1:20:20] where we've got to make a choice to
[1:20:22] choose the word
[1:20:23] remember you're predestinated not to
[1:20:26] fall
[1:20:28] doesn't mean you won't wrestle it
[1:20:30] doesn't mean you won't pray doesn't mean
[1:20:32] you won't ask god is there any other way
[1:20:34] god but you're predestinated not to fall
[1:20:38] when you get down to wrestle it out when
[1:20:40] you're subjecting this man to the word
[1:20:42] of god and pulling him down you remember
[1:20:45] i'm predestinated not to fall
[1:20:48] it's not me there's a he's got his will
[1:20:52] backing up this i can do it i can do it
[1:20:54] by his grace but i've got to make the
[1:20:56] choice i've got to make the decision he
[1:20:59] can't do that part for me i've got to
[1:21:01] choose he can't lay down my life i have
[1:21:03] to lay down my life
[1:21:08] jesus life wasn't taken from him he laid
[1:21:10] it down
[1:21:12] jesus will wasn't taken from him he laid
[1:21:14] it down he you're predestinated like
[1:21:17] he's predestinated you're part of the
[1:21:18] word like he's part of the word but your
[1:21:20] will won't be taken away it'll be laid
[1:21:22] down
[1:21:23] and your life won't be taken away it'll
[1:21:25] be surrendered
[1:21:29] i say let's get in the business of
[1:21:30] surrendering
[1:21:33] let's go back to revelation chapter 12.
[1:21:36] i want to finish with this
[1:21:38] scripture
[1:21:40] musicians you can start making your way
[1:21:41] up brother ben you can come up as well
[1:21:44] revelations chapter 12.
[1:21:54] revelations 12 and 11. we've read this
[1:21:57] many many times
[1:22:00] and they overcame him
[1:22:02] this word overcame
[1:22:05] is the exact same word as prevail in
[1:22:08] revelation chapter 5
[1:22:10] when the line of the tribe of judah has
[1:22:12] prevailed to take the book and loose the
[1:22:14] seals it's the exact same greek word to
[1:22:17] prevail he prevailed
[1:22:19] we overcome
[1:22:21] and they overcome him by the blood of
[1:22:24] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:22:25] testimony
[1:22:27] and they loved not their lives
[1:22:29] unto death
[1:22:32] they were willing
[1:22:33] to lay down their lives and surrender
[1:22:36] for him
[1:22:38] he prevailed
[1:22:40] so she can prevail
[1:22:43] he's already prevailed
[1:22:46] now we can prevail
[1:22:48] what did his prevailing look like a full
[1:22:51] surrender to the will and word of god
[1:22:53] what will our prevailing look like a
[1:22:55] full surrender to the will and the word
[1:22:58] of god
[1:23:00] remember eden was lost
[1:23:02] when somebody exerted their will over
[1:23:04] the word
[1:23:05] eden was lost
[1:23:07] heaven
[1:23:08] sin broke out in heaven when somebody
[1:23:10] exerted their will over the will of god
[1:23:14] eden fell when somebody exerted their
[1:23:16] will over the word of god
[1:23:19] but eden was won back when somebody laid
[1:23:21] down their will for the word of god
[1:23:25] redemption
[1:23:27] the fall came through adam
[1:23:30] the redemption comes through the last
[1:23:32] adam
[1:23:34] he's overcome
[1:23:36] now he's asking us to overcome
[1:23:39] not by strength or by might but by a
[1:23:42] spirit he'll do all of that what he's
[1:23:44] asking us to do is lay down our lives
[1:23:48] surrender
[1:23:50] give up
[1:23:51] so that he can do all that he's called
[1:23:52] that he's promised to do
[1:23:54] in this last time
[1:23:58] we've come to the time
[1:24:00] of god's great plan
[1:24:03] and in that time of god's great plan
[1:24:06] we've come to the end of the second fold
[1:24:08] of the threefold purpose
[1:24:10] and before we can move to the third fold
[1:24:13] which is the restored eden
[1:24:15] we have to have a restored bride
[1:24:17] he's already restored adam the last adam
[1:24:20] the sun has already been restored the
[1:24:23] next fold that we're getting ready to go
[1:24:24] to is the restored eden upon the earth
[1:24:27] but in between those he's got to restore
[1:24:29] back a bride and how will he do it when
[1:24:31] he has preeminence in a body of
[1:24:34] believers
[1:24:35] here we've come to the end of that
[1:24:37] and where is he going to have
[1:24:39] preeminence at where is it going to
[1:24:40] happen where is the victory going to
[1:24:42] come when the woman is restored and
[1:24:44] makes her stand upon the word i say god
[1:24:47] by your grace let it happen right here
[1:24:49] lord
[1:24:51] give me the strength to lay down my life
[1:24:53] and surrender lord i don't want my way
[1:24:55] when it really comes down to it i don't
[1:24:56] want my way
[1:24:58] i keep falling in the same traps i keep
[1:25:00] stumbling over the same things but when
[1:25:02] i really when i get down to the depths
[1:25:04] of my heart and cry out to god i don't
[1:25:06] want my will i don't want my way i don't
[1:25:09] want my choices i just want his
[1:25:13] let's stay there friends
[1:25:16] and see god
[1:25:17] bring a great victory
[1:25:21] it's not trivial
[1:25:24] mother branham told us that great things
[1:25:27] are silent
[1:25:29] big things powerful things
[1:25:33] said the earth turns
[1:25:35] and it never creaks
[1:25:37] you don't ever hear it
[1:25:39] you can never tell
[1:25:42] millions billions of gallons of water
[1:25:45] are lifted off the earth into the sky
[1:25:47] every day and it never makes a noise
[1:25:51] these are huge powerful forces at work
[1:25:55] and it doesn't make any noise
[1:25:59] there was something powerful a huge
[1:26:02] force a huge power that was that was
[1:26:05] moving into manifestation in gethsemane
[1:26:08] but nobody saw it even the ones closest
[1:26:11] to him were asleep
[1:26:14] something powerful was taking place in
[1:26:16] the cycle of redemption something that
[1:26:18] was going to change
[1:26:20] everything was taking place in
[1:26:22] gethsemane and nobody was even awake to
[1:26:25] watch
[1:26:28] it was one man
[1:26:30] wrestling it out with his own will and
[1:26:32] surrendering himself to god and that one
[1:26:34] man not in the eyes of anybody else with
[1:26:37] no noise that anybody could hear with
[1:26:39] nothing that you could see with an
[1:26:41] outward demonstration that would show
[1:26:43] the power what he was doing was making a
[1:26:45] decision he was making a choice he was
[1:26:47] exercising the power of free moral
[1:26:49] agency and he was the right one at the
[1:26:52] right time making the right choice and
[1:26:54] when he did
[1:26:56] he won back eden
[1:26:59] who saw it who knew it how much noise
[1:27:02] was there
[1:27:05] now we've come to the end time to the
[1:27:07] restoration of the bride tree when
[1:27:08] there's going to be a bride reflect the
[1:27:10] very same character that man in
[1:27:11] gethsemane and she's going to take her
[1:27:13] stand on the word she's going to be
[1:27:15] tested by the word and she's not going
[1:27:16] to fail she's predestinated not to fall
[1:27:19] and what's it going to look like how
[1:27:21] loud is it going to be how many people
[1:27:23] will be even spiritually awake enough to
[1:27:25] see it happen
[1:27:27] it might be taking place in your prayer
[1:27:30] closet when you're by yourself at work
[1:27:32] when you're driving down the road amen
[1:27:34] it may not be the great big thing that
[1:27:36] everybody says oh look at this powerful
[1:27:38] move it's the power of free choice and
[1:27:41] the right person at the right time
[1:27:43] making the right choice and it's moving
[1:27:45] the plan of redemption forward
[1:27:49] we talk about power that's power
[1:27:55] so god help me to surrender to your word
[1:28:00] me
[1:28:01] exercise my free choice
[1:28:04] and choose you
[1:28:06] over everything else in this world
[1:28:10] choose you
[1:28:12] don't get caught up in hoopla
[1:28:15] get down to business
[1:28:18] don't worry about what's going on all
[1:28:20] over the place and the news and
[1:28:22] all over
[1:28:24] you know there's hurricanes and fires
[1:28:27] and tornadoes and political unrest and
[1:28:30] it's not going to get any better
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:33] i mean
[1:28:34] once you read this article they're going
[1:28:36] to come out with the next article and
[1:28:38] it's going to be all the same stuff with
[1:28:39] a few different names in a few different
[1:28:41] locations
[1:28:42] and it's going to keep cycling like that
[1:28:44] it's not going to get any better so
[1:28:46] let's not be distracted by any of that
[1:28:48] and it's time to get down in fervency
[1:28:50] and prayer and say lord i want a greater
[1:28:52] surrender in my life i want to i want to
[1:28:54] die to myself more because that's what
[1:28:56] it's going to take
[1:28:59] that's what's going to move this plan of
[1:29:01] redemption for
[1:29:03] man let's all stand
[1:29:05] god bless you
[1:29:11] i was in gethsemane
[1:29:14] i just don't remember it
[1:29:17] i was on calvary
[1:29:19] not in this form
[1:29:22] but the real me
[1:29:24] the sea gene of god
[1:29:26] was there
[1:29:28] i was there
[1:29:30] this this attribute of god's overcome
[1:29:32] before it'll overcome again
[1:29:36] but god has put that attribute in a
[1:29:38] vessel
[1:29:40] and that vessel he's given life to
[1:29:43] a certain consciousness and all that
[1:29:45] stuff and
[1:29:47] he's allowed us an opportunity
[1:29:50] to surrender it all
[1:29:52] to let this life on the inside live
[1:29:56] god has set up the mechanism of free
[1:29:58] choice
[1:29:59] maybe we don't fully understand why he
[1:30:01] did it that way why it was in heaven
[1:30:03] that way and in eden that way and all
[1:30:05] down through time maybe we can't figure
[1:30:06] out all the reasons why it was that way
[1:30:08] but it was that way
[1:30:11] it's become the power that has moved
[1:30:13] god's plan along the the mind of the
[1:30:16] thought that he had in his mind before
[1:30:17] the foundation of the world it's been
[1:30:18] moving forward because of this power of
[1:30:20] free choice
[1:30:23] and so now we're coming to the end of
[1:30:25] that
[1:30:27] and the power of free choice is still
[1:30:29] moving the plan of redemption among
[1:30:32] but it's happening in your prayer closet
[1:30:35] and in my prayer closet
[1:30:38] it's happening when nobody else is
[1:30:40] hearing you pray and nobody else is
[1:30:41] understanding the agony you're under
[1:30:43] nobody else knows the the
[1:30:46] the terrible uh grief that you're
[1:30:48] experiencing nobody else knows how hard
[1:30:50] it is for you to make these choices amen
[1:30:52] but it's still the choice that's winning
[1:30:54] the victory it's surrendering to him
[1:30:58] i say let's not grow weary
[1:31:01] and giving our lives up for him
[1:31:03] let us not get tired of surrendering
[1:31:06] let us not get lazy
[1:31:08] but let's continually say lord
[1:31:11] i lay my life down
[1:31:13] for you
[1:31:14] when you're confronted with more of the
[1:31:16] word say lord i surrender to that more
[1:31:18] of the word
[1:31:19] when you're confronted with the decision
[1:31:20] in the word say lord i'm gonna take the
[1:31:22] word and give up my life and give up my
[1:31:24] own choice and give up my own will and
[1:31:26] wish
[1:31:27] to have your word
[1:31:30] and you'll be unlocking
[1:31:32] a powerful force
[1:31:35] that'll keep redemption marking forward
[1:31:39] trust in it
[1:31:40] keep surrendering to it
[1:31:42] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:31:45] lord jesus
[1:31:48] oh father god
[1:31:50] what can we say lord
[1:31:53] what can we say lord but we're your
[1:31:55] people lord

[1:32:10] and your victory

[1:32:17] lord i want more than anything
[1:32:20] to surrender
[1:32:22] i want more than anything
[1:32:24] the privilege of laying my life down
[1:32:27] of surrendering my will sometimes lord

[1:32:57] side all of our will surrendered and
[1:32:59] laid down would you just come and do
[1:33:01] with these vessels what we could never
[1:33:03] do on our own
[1:33:06] can we choose your way so that your life
[1:33:08] can manifest through us
[1:33:11] move your plan of redemption along lord
