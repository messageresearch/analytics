[14:03] morning and
[14:07] um appreciate everyone coming out and
[14:11] uh just uh it's okay maybe we'll just
[14:15] get right into the word this
[14:17] morning I uh it's got some on my heart I
[14:22] I uh it's been a blessing for me
[14:25] to uh look at and uh read
[14:29] visit I
[14:32] um it been years and years ago I I had
[14:37] um
[14:39] uh I I love I love the uh I love the
[14:43] book
[14:45] itself but uh I also like to um I like
[14:49] to have
[14:50] um a uh a computer program because it's
[14:54] easy just to click on a word and uh and
[14:58] I I um I'm so glad I clicked on that
[15:02] word and uh and when I clicked on the
[15:05] word it the Roman Candle started going
[15:08] off and it it started going off probably
[15:12] I don't know 12 14 years ago when I saw
[15:15] it and it's still going off
[15:17] so uh and so I hope uh the Roman Candle
[15:20] goes off for you this
[15:22] morning and uh uh so we're going to look
[15:25] at
[15:27] um um
[15:29] we're going to look at
[15:32] uh the book of Isaiah
[15:35] [Music]
[15:37] 41 in verse
[15:41] 8
[15:51] and but thou Israel art my
[15:55] servant Jacob whom I have chosen
[15:59] I I love I love how God flipped it
[16:02] because when before
[16:04] Jacob uh became Israel he has already
[16:08] chosen if you see that there Jacob whom
[16:11] I have chosen the Seed of Abraham my
[16:15] friend now be mindful he just he just
[16:18] referred to Jacob as a
[16:21] friend thou whom I have taken from the
[16:24] ends of the Earth and called thee from
[16:27] the chief men thereof and said unto thee
[16:30] Thou Art my servant I have chosen thee
[16:34] and not cast thee away fear thou not for
[16:39] I'm with thee I want you to notice how
[16:42] encouraging God is speaking of Jacob and
[16:47] and the multiple times that he tells him
[16:49] don't be
[16:50] afraid uh he says fear not from I'm with
[16:53] thee be not
[16:55] dismayed
[16:56] um and that dismayed speaks of anxiety
[17:00] and if we ever lived in The Age of
[17:02] Anxiety it's now amen uh and so I
[17:06] believe it's very fitting to read the
[17:07] scripture this morning says for I am thy
[17:10] God I will strengthen thee yay I will
[17:12] help thee yay I will uphold thee with
[17:15] the right hand the power the authority
[17:18] of my
[17:19] righteousness behold all they that were
[17:22] in sensed against thee shall be ashamed
[17:25] and confounded they shall be as nothing
[17:29] and they that strive with thee Shall
[17:31] Perish Thou shalt seek them and shalt
[17:35] not find them even them that contendeth
[17:39] with thee they that war against thee
[17:42] shall be as nothing and as a thing of
[17:43] not for I the Lord thy God will hold thy
[17:47] right hand saying unto thee fear not I
[17:51] will help
[17:52] thee now I want you to look at p uh at
[17:56] verse 14
[17:59] fear not thou
[18:04] worm now God had just called Jacob a
[18:08] friend in verse
[18:10] 8 and and now God's calling him a
[18:16] worm but I trust hopefully it won't take
[18:20] uh but a few minutes in this service
[18:22] that you be want to be called a worm
[18:25] too it says fear not thou worm Jacob
[18:30] and ye men now that men doesn't
[18:32] necessarily speak speak of masculine
[18:35] male and female but that actually speaks
[18:37] of few so if I could read it ye
[18:40] few a faithful few ye few of
[18:45] Israel I will help Thee sayith the Lord
[18:48] and thy Redeemer the Holy One of
[18:52] Israel and I'd like to speak to you uh
[18:55] this
[18:56] morning by the help of the Lord on the
[19:00] Crimson worm let's bow our heads
[19:04] Heavenly Father truly we love you
[19:07] today and grateful to be called by your
[19:11] name and Lord we just want to ask that
[19:15] your forgiveness be upon our lives
[19:20] today Lord each one that's here this
[19:24] morning might it be a repented heart
[19:28] mind and included Lord that we could
[19:30] stand before you uh pure and white
[19:34] clean arrayed in fine linen and Lord
[19:39] we're just wanting to gather around your
[19:41] Eternal Word and ask that you'd have
[19:44] full sway in this service Lord for our
[19:48] pastor Brother
[19:50] Kyle Brothers there's as their way
[19:54] Minister and we're asking that your
[19:55] blessings would flow Lord to them
[20:00] strengthen and encourage them and each
[20:03] one that they would receive something
[20:05] from thee and Lord we welcome you here
[20:09] in this service Lord asking that you
[20:12] would have the preeminence uh I want
[20:16] Lord uh it to be a service where only
[20:20] your word is brought forth and that my
[20:22] thoughts would be set aside and that
[20:24] your Eternal Word would shine forth
[20:27] today that we could see you a little bit
[20:30] clear and walk a little bit straighter
[20:33] and talk with more clarity in our in our
[20:36] testimony God we love you we praise you
[20:39] and we commit all we are into your hands
[20:42] and we ask these things to be so in the
[20:44] mighty unfailing name of our Lord and
[20:47] Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[20:52] be seated if
[20:54] like the Crimson worm and uh uh it it
[21:00] I'm going to have to maybe build a
[21:01] little bit but uh you you bear with me
[21:05] um and so thinking of a little itty
[21:08] bitty Worm but I I want to go back to uh
[21:12] before there ever was a world and as God
[21:16] uh spoke uh not only this world into
[21:19] existence but the universe and how
[21:22] inexhaustable and unattainable and how
[21:24] Mighty and unfathomable this universe
[21:27] that we live in is
[21:29] right it goes from eternity to Eternity
[21:31] and as great big as this universe is and
[21:35] unfathomable for our minds to comprehend
[21:38] that it goes from Glory into Glory but I
[21:42] I I want you as we all know as Believers
[21:45] that even though this universe is so
[21:48] unmeasurable and and unv comprehendable
[21:52] with our own uh Minds yet God is so
[21:56] mindful even to uh seemingly the
[21:59] insignificance of a worm and uh this
[22:04] little Crimson worm that we're going to
[22:06] speak of this morning is is quite a
[22:10] beautiful uh little worm and uh uh it's
[22:15] more of uh maybe a a grub um uh the the
[22:19] the males uh have wings but the the
[22:23] mothers do not and this worm as you I
[22:27] want you to you'll see the
[22:29] characteristics and it's going to paint
[22:32] a beautiful picture of
[22:34] redemption um this particular worm uh
[22:38] we're going to speak of the mother this
[22:40] morning but when she um uh is going to
[22:45] uh give birth she finds a particular oak
[22:50] tree and it's a Evergreen Oak tree that
[22:56] she she doesn't just take pick any
[22:58] particular tree but there's a deep
[23:00] calling out to the Deep amen and and
[23:04] this little itty bitty worm finds in the
[23:07] Mediterranean and in northern Europe and
[23:10] it it finds this uh Evergreen Oak Tree
[23:15] and when this little mother begins to uh
[23:20] uh be with child she attaches herself to
[23:24] a a a root or excuse me to a a branch or
[23:28] or a a the trunk of a tree and she fixes
[23:32] herself in such a way as it's no she
[23:36] goes uh to the point of no return that
[23:40] uh once she's there she's there and
[23:43] she's going to finish it through because
[23:46] when she attaches herself to this tree
[23:49] she will never leave it again and and
[23:54] and these uh particular uh uh uh worms
[23:59] are actually used uh uh way back when in
[24:03] the um there there's a uh a cup full of
[24:07] them these these are very very small
[24:10] little worms they are actually so
[24:13] beautiful how God designed them they are
[24:16] between five and 7 mm in
[24:20] length yes uh that's Grace and
[24:24] Perfection uh
[24:26] and come on brother Frank go brother
[24:29] Franco got a little preview there in the
[24:31] back so
[24:32] I so uh when you see these they are
[24:36] little itty bitty things uh there's a a
[24:39] a picture of one um and and in in uh the
[24:43] the fingers uh of of someone and uh it
[24:47] is actually used uh in the making of
[24:50] dyes uh way back in the in the ancient
[24:53] days it was actually used uh this
[24:56] particular worm was used into making the
[24:59] Tabernacle uh when when uh Moses uh got
[25:03] the blueprint from God and as you see
[25:06] there was four layers to that uh four
[25:09] outside layers to that Tabernacle his
[25:11] Badger skin Ram skin died red and so
[25:15] that Ram skin dyed red was made with
[25:19] those little itty bitty
[25:20] worms uh and and not only that but when
[25:23] it was on the inside of the Tabernacle
[25:26] that was also anything that was a
[25:28] Scarlet of crimson was used as such was
[25:31] used of this little worm even to the
[25:34] priest's garments uh when they used this
[25:37] when they dyed uh the priest garments it
[25:40] was made with this Scarlet worm uh so
[25:43] beautiful even so much uh with the red
[25:46] heer in the sacrifice when it would have
[25:49] the cedar wood the hiss up and the
[25:51] Scarlet that Scarlet was actually that
[25:54] Crimson worm uh whenever it was uh
[25:57] whenever they would have the scapegoat
[25:59] and and they would uh you won't find
[26:01] this in scripture but according to
[26:03] Jewish tradition they would take a
[26:05] Scarlet thread and they would wrap U the
[26:08] uh one that was going to be uh sent out
[26:11] of the camp they would wrap it around
[26:13] the the the horns and and then the other
[26:15] one that was going to be offered for a
[26:17] sacrifice they would wrap a Scarlet
[26:19] thread around its neck and obviously
[26:23] speaking of
[26:24] redemption uh and even so beautiful that
[26:28] uh
[26:29] uh uh when when um Rahab would let down
[26:34] despised it was by a Scarlet
[26:38] thread and so that Scarlet thread was
[26:41] speaking of redemption and and so as we
[26:44] begin to look at this uh I I I it's just
[26:48] going to paint a beautiful picture if I
[26:50] can uh by the help of the Lord bring it
[26:53] in a way that you'll be able to see it
[26:54] because uh as our Prophet taught us in
[26:57] the Bible plainly SP tells us that
[27:00] there's a Scarlet thread that rolls
[27:02] through the Scriptures it starts in
[27:04] Genesis and it goes all the way to the
[27:06] Book of Revelations and I'm so grateful
[27:09] to be tied to that Scarlet thread this
[27:12] morning amen and so the first time that
[27:15] the Scarlet thread is spoken of is in
[27:18] Genesis 38: 28 uh when it speaks of
[27:22] Tamar and Judah and Tamar uh uh is found
[27:27] in the lineage of of Christ as we all
[27:29] know as Bible readers uh but uh her her
[27:32] husband had uh passed away before she
[27:35] was able to conceive uh and uh then she
[27:39] had married the next son and he had
[27:41] passed away and then Judah had begin to
[27:43] uh uh promis her another son but then he
[27:46] he he he uh faded away from that and and
[27:49] so she took it upon herself uh to bring
[27:52] forth that that firstborn child and I
[27:56] believe it was a deep calling out to a
[27:58] deep because through Tamar comes the
[28:00] lineage of Jesus Christ naturally
[28:03] speaking and so uh a beautiful thing
[28:07] that um uh and as you see in the
[28:09] scripture there Tamar had brought forth
[28:12] twins but uh Zarah was actually the one
[28:16] that had the Scarlet thread as the as
[28:19] the picture shows you but
[28:22] phz was was considered the first born
[28:26] but but Zara was the one that stuck out
[28:28] his hand first and so uh if and if you
[28:30] want to look at that in the Book of
[28:32] Matthew it tells us Matthew chap 1 uh in
[28:36] verse three and Judas beet FES and Zarah
[28:39] of Tamar and FES beet ezam and ezam be
[28:43] got amram and on on on down to David
[28:45] everybody with me so
[28:48] far but the beautiful thing is even
[28:51] though FZ was that natural seed line
[28:55] Zara was a reflection of Christ The
[28:57] Royal seed amen yes so so when we when
[29:02] we look at this now now this ain't just
[29:05] my thought thankfully this morning uh
[29:08] we're not dependent upon my uh idea of
[29:11] it but we've had a prophet of God in our
[29:13] day give us uh the Divine interpretation
[29:17] of it with Divine
[29:19] Vindication and and so brother branam
[29:22] has asked this question in
[29:25] 1957 and he explains it in questions and
[29:27] an
[29:28] the Hebrews uh three the first baby that
[29:32] was to be born the old Jewish custom the
[29:35] firstborn had the birthright the first
[29:38] child to break forth and remember was
[29:41] her first child none of the rest of the
[29:44] boys had any uh children by her they're
[29:46] so beautiful by the way brother John pre
[29:49] singing the Crimson stream believe was
[29:52] very fitting this
[29:53] morning uh she so watch she said uh none
[29:56] of the rest of boys had had had any
[29:59] children by her she never had a child to
[30:02] this time and when her first child broke
[30:04] forth it was just a hand and the Midwife
[30:07] put a a Scarlet streak around because a
[30:11] Scarlet streak spake of redemption that
[30:14] the first son of the Virgin Mary would
[30:18] have the Scarlet streak of
[30:20] redemption PowerPoint courtesy of
[30:23] brother
[30:24] Franco and when he drew his hand back
[30:28] the other one came first and when he did
[30:31] said why did you do this the other one
[30:34] has the birthright so that was Genesis
[30:37] 38 means you see that the first child
[30:39] still remained until the coming of the
[30:42] Lord Jesus that the first was under the
[30:44] Redemptive law so so when we think about
[30:48] this uh
[30:50] um looking at at
[30:56] um Genesis
[30:58] phz was the one that had the natural
[31:01] birth right but but zarra was the one
[31:05] that broke forth the hand from The
[31:06] Matrix and the and the the the Midwife
[31:09] wrapped that Scarlet thread around her
[31:12] which spoke of Christ see because we in
[31:15] our natural selves there look I don't
[31:18] know about you but I cannot brag on my
[31:21] natural uh family
[31:26] tree amen but but that's why phz didn't
[31:30] have the Scarlet thread Zarah
[31:35] did Hallelujah see because uh this
[31:39] morning we are not
[31:42] looking we are not looking to a natural
[31:45] seed
[31:48] line cuz the Bible tells us that we're
[31:51] that we've been purchased by the blood
[31:53] of
[31:54] God we we are not saved this morning by
[31:57] Jewish blood nor no you know people want
[32:01] to argue what you know what what color
[32:03] was Jesus and I look Jesus was God Amen
[32:07] right that that that
[32:11] hemoglobin sperm of of the mighty one
[32:15] Jehovah himself we are saved by the
[32:18] blood of God right and so when we look
[32:21] at FES FZ may have been the first
[32:25] natural of firstborn naturally speaking
[32:29] but but Christ was actually in Zarah
[32:32] showing a prefigure that he was before
[32:35] David in David and after David he is
[32:38] both root and offspring of
[32:41] David and so we are not coming into this
[32:44] world by happenstance or chance but
[32:47] every one of our footsteps is divinely
[32:51] orchestrated by the
[32:54] almighty amen hallelujah amen yes yes so
[32:59] so so grateful this morning to be able
[33:03] to stand here and and remember brother
[33:06] bam talked about a Scarlet he said
[33:08] Scarlet speaks of
[33:13] royalty
[33:16] so when we look at Isaiah
[33:20] 41 and he says he calls him a
[33:25] friend but then he says
[33:28] Jacob the worm
[33:31] Jacob he's
[33:33] referring to
[33:35] Jacob as this Crimson
[33:43] worm
[33:47] now as you follow this worm through the
[33:51] scriptures God Is So Perfect in his word
[33:55] amen so much so that in job
[33:59] 25 it speaks of not only one Worm but
[34:04] two yes how then can man be justified
[34:08] with God or or how can he be clean that
[34:12] is born of a woman behold even to the
[34:15] moon and it shineth not y the stars are
[34:18] not pureing his sight how much man that
[34:22] is a
[34:23] worm and the son of man which is a worm
[34:28] amen and so in this scripture here
[34:32] there's actually
[34:34] twins praise
[34:38] God because the son of man
[34:42] worm is cus elisius the Crimson
[34:46] Worm but the
[34:48] manorm is actually a maggot
[34:54] yes and it and it actually speaks of of
[34:58] being exalted or lifted
[35:00] up so so in the
[35:04] scriptures you actually see
[35:09] twins so much
[35:11] so that there was a can and there was an
[35:14] Abel there was an Esau and there was a
[35:17] Jacob there was a Jesus and a
[35:20] Judas and there was wheat and
[35:23] tears and there was two
[35:25] worms but one was covered by the blood
[35:28] and the other one was not praise God
[35:32] amen
[35:34] amen and as we know this quote so
[35:38] perfectly H it heard it many times but
[35:40] don't let it become common to you the
[35:43] Book of Revelation shows that the
[35:44] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[35:46] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[35:49] formal and Powerless it exposes Satan
[35:52] Reveals His Works attempting destruction
[35:54] of God's people and the discrediting of
[35:56] God's word right down to the time that
[35:58] he is cast into the Lake of Fire he
[36:00] fights that he cannot stand it he knows
[36:03] that if the people get the true
[36:04] revelation of the true church and what
[36:07] she is what she stands for and that she
[36:09] can do the Greater Works she will be an
[36:12] invincible Army if they get a true
[36:15] revelation of the two Spirits working
[36:19] within the framework of the Christian
[36:21] church and by God's spirit discern and
[36:23] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[36:25] will be powerless amen before
[36:29] her and so I I I I'm just I'm so
[36:33] grateful this morning that God would
[36:36] have you know we all know that God's
[36:39] word's
[36:40] perfect but I love to see it um Express
[36:44] itself in perfection even down to when
[36:49] he speaks of
[36:50] worms that there would be
[36:53] two and that it would be so close that
[36:55] it would deceive the very elected
[36:58] if it were
[36:59] possible but remember one was under the
[37:03] anointing of a
[37:05] man and the other one was under the
[37:07] anointing of the son of man amen
[37:11] amen God and and and so because we are
[37:16] under that the under the opes of the son
[37:19] of man Ministry that is the reflection
[37:22] of the Crimson worm everybody with me
[37:25] this morning y'all don't think I'm crazy
[37:27] do you
[37:28] I am a little bit
[37:32] but but so so we have to be Anointed
[37:37] with that son of man Ministry and by
[37:40] being Anointed with that son of man
[37:42] Ministry shows that we are reflecting
[37:44] this little Crimson worm amen
[37:49] amen and again you think of how vast the
[37:52] universe
[37:53] is but God is mindful of every little
[37:57] little
[37:58] detail and when God created and this is
[38:02] what I I I hope you catch when God
[38:05] created this little itty bitty worm
[38:08] there would be billions upon billions of
[38:11] people look at this worm and not see
[38:15] what you see this
[38:19] morning amen but it just goes to show
[38:23] the Perfection of God that he is mindful
[38:26] down to the least
[38:28] ity
[38:31] detail you think of all the billions of
[38:33] these worms that's that's lived and
[38:36] given birth and every time that one gave
[38:40] birth it was expressing the book of
[38:43] redemption amen every time that it was
[38:46] being crushed to bring forth that
[38:48] Scarlet dye it was reflecting the
[38:53] almighty God Is So Perfect yes Amen in
[38:58] every aspect of his being and so when
[39:02] you when you would
[39:04] see in the
[39:06] scriptures watch E
[39:10] even even to
[39:14] um Psalms 22
[39:17] And1 when David would be anointed and he
[39:20] would cry out my God my God why hast
[39:23] Thou forsaken
[39:25] me thou art the th so far from helping
[39:28] me and from the words of my roaring
[39:32] David would be under the anointing and
[39:34] he would be prophesying what our what
[39:37] our great
[39:38] uh our great Redeemer would Express that
[39:42] day on calvary's
[39:46] tree but I want you to notice what he
[39:48] says in verse
[39:51] 6 he says but I am a
[39:54] worm and no man
[39:59] a reproach of men and despised of the
[40:03] people so David was actually expressing
[40:07] what Christ was going to be portraying
[40:10] that day on
[40:12] Calvary
[40:13] because Christ almighty would be saying
[40:17] as as he's walking down those cobbled
[40:20] streets carrying a Rugged Cross he would
[40:24] be
[40:25] expressing this little Crimson
[40:29] worm so when he says I am a worm he's
[40:33] saying I am this little itty bitty
[40:37] caucus
[40:39] elisis I am not a man I I am
[40:43] portraying this Scarlet thread of
[40:52] redemption so
[40:54] when the Lord Jesus
[40:58] would be stripped in Matthew
[41:02] 27 and those Roman soldiers would wrap a
[41:06] Scarlet robe around
[41:08] him if you have a bible program and you
[41:11] tap on the word scarlet it'll take you
[41:15] to that Scarlet
[41:19] worm so when he says I am a worm and no
[41:23] man and those and those Roman soldiers
[41:26] are wrapped in in a Scarlet thread they
[41:29] are portraying Psalms
[41:33] 22 because they are they are wrapping
[41:36] him in this Scarlet robe and because see
[41:41] it is is so beautiful everybody see
[41:44] this he says and so so what they are
[41:48] doing when they're mocking him because
[41:51] remember when we would not have a birth
[41:54] this morning if it wasn't for Christ
[41:57] saying I am a worm and no man because he
[42:01] was laying down his life for us his
[42:05] sheep right and and so and
[42:09] so it this is so
[42:12] beautiful
[42:13] that when you look at this study out
[42:17] this this this particular worm it says
[42:21] the dye was made from the dried body of
[42:24] the female worm cus elisius worm maggot
[42:28] grub grub the worm cus elisius when the
[42:31] female of the Scarlet worm species was
[42:33] ready to give F birth to her young she
[42:36] would attach her body to the trunk of a
[42:38] tree fixing herself so firmly and perly
[42:42] that she would never leave again the
[42:45] eggs deposited beneath her body were
[42:47] thus protected until the larvey were
[42:49] hatched and able to enter into their own
[42:51] life cycle as the mother died the
[42:54] Crimson fluid stained her body and the
[42:57] surrounding
[42:59] wood so when this little itty bitty worm
[43:03] is giving birth to her young she is
[43:07] portraying that day on calvary's
[43:12] tree prise
[43:16] God because he told us to eat his flesh
[43:20] and drink his
[43:22] blood he also
[43:24] says that the that them baby as they are
[43:28] as they are coming to the mature time to
[43:30] be birthed they begin to feed upon their
[43:37] mother he is the
[43:40] bread of
[43:42] life and what are we feeding on this
[43:44] morning the unfailing body word of the
[43:47] son of man not a man not a not a maggot
[43:51] that's death right when maggots are
[43:54] there that's when something dies and
[43:55] it's the decompose right but but this
[43:58] right here is to have life and life more
[44:02] abundantly right and and so this this
[44:05] worm it it it is so precious that as and
[44:11] it's not a very good picture but you can
[44:14] see that as these mothers had given
[44:16] birth the the the tree is stained by the
[44:21] the life of that
[44:23] mother
[44:25] yes this same as that Rugged
[44:31] Cross was stained some 2,000 years
[44:36] ago so that we could have
[44:39] life and life more
[44:47] abundantly so when he would say in
[44:49] Psalms
[44:50] 22 my God my God why hast Thou forsaken
[44:53] me and then verse 22: 6
[44:58] but I am a
[45:00] worm what was he doing he was
[45:04] expressing what he had created however
[45:07] many thousands however many hundreds of
[45:09] years ago when when he had that worm in
[45:13] his mind and he created it it was a
[45:16] prefigure of what he would do that day
[45:17] on calvary's
[45:20] Street amen so that we could be stained
[45:29] amen look I want to show I want you to
[45:31] see how perfect God's word is so much so
[45:35] that the name cus
[45:37] elisius cus means grain or seed elisius
[45:42] means it is
[45:49] finished
[45:52] so so so when God even named that little
[45:56] one
[45:58] hidden in that name was
[46:04] Redemption hidden in that name oh
[46:08] my where is our hiding place it's in the
[46:12] name it's in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:16] right and and
[46:20] so I'm trying to be good and just and
[46:23] just uh deliver cuz I got so much and
[46:28] and when I studied this
[46:31] out um couple weeks
[46:34] ago um I came across this
[46:38] um this um article and it was published
[46:43] this year July
[46:44] 19th uh of this year and when uh they
[46:48] were actually Excavating in um in um the
[46:52] Judean desert in the it's called the
[46:54] cave of skulls they actually found two
[46:58] little itty bitty pieces of material
[47:01] that they had
[47:03] carbonated back um because and they had
[47:07] they had found out that this this
[47:09] material was actually dyed with that uh
[47:13] Crimson
[47:15] worm and that little itty bitty piece of
[47:18] material that you see in there is 3800
[47:21] years old they say
[47:27] but it's still
[47:34] red
[47:37] and see uh when you when you look at how
[47:42] permanent this
[47:44] is um it
[47:49] is it it's something that lets us know
[47:54] that um when God does something it's
[48:00] permanent it's not anything that Fades
[48:03] away sometimes we we we wonder and
[48:06] question but God is Not guessing right
[48:09] now he knows the end from the
[48:12] beginning
[48:14] and when the Lord Jesus spilled his
[48:18] blood that blood may have been spilled
[48:20] some 2,000 years ago but it's
[48:25] permanent it's unchanged changing it's
[48:28] unfailing it's unmovable amen and the
[48:33] Bible tells her greater love hath no man
[48:36] than this that a man laid down his life
[48:40] for his friends and that mother when she
[48:45] gives
[48:46] birth she is so designed and engineered
[48:50] that she gives her life
[48:54] willingly amen you don't have to tell
[48:57] her nothing amen she willingly gives her
[49:00] life for babies the same as you sisters
[49:03] in a world of perversion you stand as
[49:07] beacons of
[49:10] light you you didn't you didn't you
[49:12] didn't you didn't become a a career
[49:14] woman and but but you gave your life for
[49:18] your
[49:19] babies that's what a real mother is and
[49:22] that's what not only these little itty
[49:25] bitty worms was portrayed praying but
[49:27] remember he's he's El
[49:29] Shai the breasted
[49:31] one and you know it it is so
[49:35] beautiful as this as this mother dies
[49:38] and gives birth to her
[49:40] babies that three days later after she
[49:50] dies three days after she
[49:55] dies right
[49:57] amen Easter morning praise
[50:01] God it it's the Plan of
[50:03] Redemption and so it would have to be 3
[50:06] days
[50:07] later that what was left of her would be
[50:11] transformed why as
[50:17] wool see because the Bible tells us in
[50:21] Isaiah
[50:23] 1:18 come
[50:25] now let let us reason together saith and
[50:30] I want you to know this is not brother
[50:31] Gabe that's Sayang this this
[50:34] morning but it's the almighty amen and
[50:37] when he tells you to come it actually
[50:40] means to walk together a manner of life
[50:44] God is telling you I want to walk with
[50:47] you and when it says now he's pleading
[50:51] with
[50:54] you so he's I want you to understand in
[50:57] just a few of these verses come means to
[51:01] walk with you now means he's pleading
[51:04] with you and when it says let us reason
[51:08] together that actually means to
[51:19] argue so the
[51:22] god of the
[51:24] universe actually wants to walk with
[51:28] you and be polite in saying
[51:32] please but he actually wants to argue
[51:34] with
[51:36] you saith the Lord though your sins be
[51:41] as
[51:43] Scarlet now no doubt some of us got some
[51:45] things that we done 5 10 20 30 50 years
[51:52] ago just like 3,800 years old
[51:57] that's right but God tells you I want to
[52:01] argue with you about this yes
[52:04] amen
[52:07] amen now it's he don't want to argue
[52:09] with you about how sinful you
[52:12] are and the mistake you made he don't
[52:15] want to rebuke you and chide you and you
[52:18] know really rub it in and because you
[52:20] done this I'm going to make you pay for
[52:22] it
[52:24] and but actually
[52:28] he's saying I'm going to argue with
[52:30] you
[52:32] look I want you to look at this word
[52:35] reason it means to reprove judge rebuke
[52:40] God wants to rebuke you he wants to
[52:43] correct
[52:45] you he wants to reason to reason to get
[52:48] to Chase and to CH convince convict to
[52:52] argue when God is saying I am going I
[52:56] come
[52:57] let us reason
[53:02] together though your sins look you fill
[53:06] in the blank amen
[53:10] amen whatever and and no doubt all of us
[53:14] have a kink in the
[53:16] armor and all of us have that time that
[53:19] remember brother bam says Satan's got a
[53:22] punch and so all of us have that time
[53:25] that we had our guard down
[53:27] and we got knocked out by
[53:29] Satan sometimes multiple times right and
[53:33] it's that thing that keeps coming up
[53:35] every something to happen or something
[53:37] to trigger it whatever it may be and it
[53:39] comes back up and it's just as fresh as
[53:42] the day had
[53:43] happened this is when you need to go to
[53:45] this scripture right here
[53:48] amen because God is telling
[53:52] you I want to argue with you
[53:58] that means I ain't
[54:02] leaving that means God's not going to
[54:04] take no for an
[54:06] answer that though your
[54:09] sins be as
[54:11] Scarlet they shall be white as snow am
[54:16] and though they be red like Crimson they
[54:19] shall be made white like w
[54:32] see brother brandham told us many times
[54:35] he talked about red through red equals
[54:38] white right and and we all have got to
[54:42] remember back in the day we'd had them
[54:43] little things the little filters we'd
[54:45] look through and remember we remember
[54:51] these remember and we get to had the
[54:54] picture or whatever and you had you
[54:55] couldn't see it until you put a filter
[54:58] over
[54:59] it and when you put the filter over it
[55:02] then you could actually see what was
[55:08] hidden and the Bible tells
[55:11] us that the heavens declare the glory of
[55:15] God and the firmament showeth his
[55:19] handiwork and when in this last
[55:23] day man has designed things in such a a
[55:26] way called the Hubble telescope that it
[55:30] can go billions and millions of
[55:34] miles and look and see images can you
[55:39] imagine that's actually a picture from
[55:41] the h Hubble
[55:43] Telescope I don't know about you but I
[55:45] think God's eyes are
[55:51] blue and
[55:57] I don't know about you but that looks
[55:58] like the hand of
[56:01] God so when this so when this telescope
[56:04] would look out into the he
[56:08] Heavens you would see an eye a
[56:14] hand but you would also see
[56:22] this only in our day
[56:29] because that Hubble Telescope has
[56:31] prophetic
[56:36] vision and so when we could look at now
[56:39] now science looks at that and they just
[56:41] see uh they call it a
[56:43] ribbon but when we as Believers look at
[56:46] that we see the Scarlet thread of
[56:51] redemption and when I when I looked at
[56:53] this it's so beautiful that
[56:57] uh this is actually the remnants from a
[56:59] star that had
[57:02] died a
[57:03] supernova
[57:06] happened a son
[57:09] died and when a son died the remnants of
[57:13] it was a Scarlet streak of
[57:17] redemption
[57:25] amen and you know what last night I was
[57:27] reading this studying on it and I came
[57:28] across it and the way and it said that
[57:31] that you could only you could only see
[57:33] that by a filter and I thought oh man so
[57:37] you can't see with the natural eye and I
[57:39] was all tore up about it and I took it
[57:41] out of my PowerPoint and I thought oh
[57:43] man I was just so disappointed cuz it
[57:45] looks so good and Oh I thought man then
[57:49] this morning I got up about 1:30 this
[57:51] morning and was studying and praying and
[57:53] and then I looked at it again and it
[57:55] says you can only see it with
[57:58] a
[58:00] filter
[58:03] [Laughter]
[58:06] hallu so so that image you can't see
[58:10] with the naked
[58:12] eye just like people look at you and go
[58:15] what do they believe
[58:17] amen and you go but you just have to
[58:20] have the filter praise
[58:24] God and when you have the the
[58:27] filter then you can see the Scarlet
[58:30] streak of
[58:31] redemption because what's invisible to
[58:34] some is made visible to some
[58:38] too and when we have the filter of
[58:42] thinking man's
[58:45] filter right what is invisible to some
[58:49] Is Not Invisible to
[58:51] all see blessed are your eyes
[58:56] for they
[58:57] see and blessed are your ears for they
[59:02] hear so it could only be in this day
[59:06] this supern NOA happened in
[59:10] ad16 it happened over a thousand years a
[59:14] thousand years ago that Supernova
[59:16] happened and they said when it happened
[59:19] it was recorded uh by the the
[59:22] astrologers back then that's why they
[59:24] know it it was actually May 1st
[59:26] a
[59:28] 1006 cuz it was the brightest star in
[59:31] the sky at that
[59:37] time but even though
[59:41] that even though that star had
[59:45] faded the Scarlet streak Still
[59:51] Remains The Scarlet streak of redemption
[59:54] Still Remains
[59:59] amen but we got to have a filter to be
[1:00:04] able to
[1:00:14] see you know when
[1:00:17] Rebecca came to her Isaac the Bible
[1:00:22] tells us that Isaac was actually at a
[1:00:26] whale called leor a
[1:00:31] leor but if you look at that word that
[1:00:34] actually means The Well of the living
[1:00:37] one seeing
[1:00:42] me and in verse 63 and Isaac went out to
[1:00:46] meditate in the field at the evening
[1:00:47] tide and he lifted up his eyes and saw
[1:00:51] and
[1:00:52] behold the camels were coming
[1:00:57] and remember as as pastor had preached
[1:01:01] on the a couple Services ago that what
[1:01:07] Rebecca had
[1:01:09] watered represented the power the Holy
[1:01:12] Ghost the word that brought her to her
[1:01:15] Isaac right but I want you to
[1:01:19] notice Isaac was watering at The Well of
[1:01:22] the living one seeing me yes right
[1:01:28] but when Isaac looked out to see
[1:01:32] something he didn't see
[1:01:37] Rebecca saw the
[1:01:43] camel he wasn't looking at
[1:01:47] me when he took me
[1:01:51] in wasn't looking at my heart
[1:01:56] amen that was Black by
[1:01:59] sin he was looking at the
[1:02:03] blood flowing rich and
[1:02:07] freeall that precious
[1:02:11] blood that pardon
[1:02:16] me see when Rebecca was on her way to
[1:02:19] her Isaac Isaac never saw
[1:02:22] her all he saw was the camels amen
[1:02:27] yes we look at ourselves all the time
[1:02:31] and we look at a natural mirror and
[1:02:34] that's why we live such a defeated
[1:02:38] life I didn't say you I said
[1:02:45] we but when he you know what that word
[1:02:48] lifted means that lifted means to Bear
[1:02:50] up endure take away
[1:02:53] forgive to be swept away
[1:02:56] so when he lifted up his eyes it
[1:03:00] would he had eyes of
[1:03:08] forgiveness and what did he see he saw
[1:03:11] the power that was packing his bride to
[1:03:18] him so how are we going to get to our
[1:03:22] Isaac the only way is by the camel amen
[1:03:26] we will never make heaven in our own
[1:03:28] power in our own
[1:03:31] ability amen it it'll never happen and
[1:03:34] and you know the thing of it is is is is
[1:03:36] we get so bogged down and we see our
[1:03:40] mistakes and we see our failures but you
[1:03:47] you you know I I
[1:03:49] uh I
[1:03:52] uh I I bought a hundred of these
[1:03:56] I was going to use them for a youth
[1:03:58] meeting but this morning things changed
[1:04:00] so I got a hundred of them in my in my
[1:04:03] bag if anybody needs a
[1:04:05] reminder sorry about the other 200 of
[1:04:08] you I have to share cut it in
[1:04:14] half because we need these
[1:04:19] reminders be you
[1:04:21] know you know brother brandom tells us
[1:04:24] this he says ohen them little fellows
[1:04:27] it's that innocence I've often thought
[1:04:30] how innocent a child is and yet if we
[1:04:31] could only be as innocent as one of
[1:04:33] these little
[1:04:34] children but come to find
[1:04:38] out yes praise God
[1:04:42] amen amen we're more
[1:04:45] innocent when the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:47] has cleansed us amen from all of our
[1:04:50] sins
[1:04:53] amen but you have to believe that
[1:04:57] that quote does no good standing in a
[1:05:00] PowerPoint it does no good s being
[1:05:03] projected amen it you
[1:05:07] you when Satan tries to tear you
[1:05:12] down you have to have confidence not in
[1:05:18] yourself you know sometimes we we
[1:05:20] struggle so much in seeing ourselves in
[1:05:24] Eagles
[1:05:27] but how about
[1:05:30] this can you just see yourself as a worm
[1:05:35] yeah some of us would struggle with
[1:05:38] self-confidence right are we all like
[1:05:40] I'm an e Eagle belt buckle how about a
[1:05:43] worm belt
[1:05:52] buckle you know maybe I get a worm Bel
[1:05:56] Buckle Crimson worm Bel
[1:05:59] Buckle y'all really pray for me then
[1:06:01] will
[1:06:07] you but we
[1:06:09] struggle with our
[1:06:14] confidence but God is so mindful that
[1:06:17] look if you can't see yourself as an
[1:06:19] eagle how about a
[1:06:21] worm he's got something for you this
[1:06:23] morning you're insecure
[1:06:26] you know you know we we have so many
[1:06:28] shortcomings in our lives I I I I was I
[1:06:31] was coming across something uh actually
[1:06:34] it was at work uh our our supervisor
[1:06:37] that he gives a trivia every at the
[1:06:39] morning at our daily safety meeting and
[1:06:42] uh he said that there's uh uh two things
[1:06:45] that every one of us as human beings uh
[1:06:48] two fears that every one of us are born
[1:06:50] with
[1:06:52] yes there's no way around it
[1:06:56] you're you're born from birth every one
[1:06:58] of us no matter how good mama is no
[1:07:01] matter how good daddy is every one of us
[1:07:04] in this world we're born with two fears
[1:07:07] and that's falling and loud
[1:07:10] noises all your other fears and phobias
[1:07:12] are learned by uh happen stance and
[1:07:15] things that happen and scars and
[1:07:17] problems and all those different things
[1:07:19] but but innately we are born with a fear
[1:07:22] of falling and I and I Daron to say that
[1:07:25] that fear of falling continues to build
[1:07:27] and grow and morphs into all kind of
[1:07:30] different ways where we're afraid to
[1:07:33] fall and because we're afraid to fall we
[1:07:36] sit on the sidelines and we don't do
[1:07:38] what God told us to do
[1:07:41] amen because we let complexes and
[1:07:44] shortcomings and this happened and that
[1:07:47] happened and I did this and I did that
[1:07:53] and and you know what we go over and
[1:07:56] over and over and over and over again
[1:08:00] our Pastors in this town or in this
[1:08:02] state Oregon right now and this right
[1:08:05] here those are called the Oregon Oregon
[1:08:07] uh Trail ruts and that they were they
[1:08:10] were actually made by the Pioneers from
[1:08:12] 1843 to
[1:08:14] 1869 so so those Wagon Wheels went
[1:08:17] across mile after mile year after year
[1:08:21] and because they traveled that same road
[1:08:24] those ruts were
[1:08:27] made and now it's a
[1:08:32] monument but I wonder how many ruts do
[1:08:36] we have on the inside of
[1:08:43] us right and we travel over and
[1:08:50] over and
[1:08:52] over and over why do you do it
[1:08:56] why do I do it but I would have I wish
[1:09:01] I and you
[1:09:04] do we do discredit to the blood of
[1:09:15] God how are you supposed to move forward
[1:09:19] in life when you keep going over these
[1:09:22] same Pathways of life
[1:09:27] and it becomes so ingrained in our
[1:09:32] subconscious I'm no
[1:09:35] good I'm a failure I make so I make so
[1:09:39] many mistakes I do you know that is that
[1:09:43] is
[1:09:44] such brother Benham tells us
[1:09:47] this he says your right mental attitude
[1:09:50] towards God's Divine promise will bring
[1:09:52] any promise to pass now maybe you don't
[1:09:55] believe believe
[1:09:58] that you say well my faith is
[1:10:03] weak I wouldn't confess it
[1:10:07] amen don't let the devil know that
[1:10:11] always say I've got good

[1:10:29] or anymore prise God Amen

[1:14:11] know it's just as easy as simple as
[1:14:13] letting go if you're struggling with
[1:14:14] something this morning do you know that
[1:14:18] brother brandham taught us brother B
[1:14:20] taught us that uh uh you know uh I love
[1:14:23] I'm a city boy but I I I do know how I
[1:14:26] do have a few hunting tips for you this
[1:14:29] morning brother Ben where's your iPad at
[1:14:31] your notebook you you going to need this
[1:14:33] one
[1:14:34] brother this straight from the
[1:14:39] prophet brother Banner brother brandham
[1:14:42] uh brother brandham taught us that uh if
[1:14:45] if you're trying to catch a catch a
[1:14:47] raccoon he said uh he said he take a
[1:14:50] tree take a take a log that fell down
[1:14:53] where a raccoon had been running that
[1:14:55] tree that log and he said you you bore a
[1:14:58] hole in it and then you take nails and
[1:15:01] you drive them in this way and that way
[1:15:03] right and then he said he'd take a a
[1:15:05] tobacco tin and he would put a the shiny
[1:15:08] aluminum piece of the tobacco tin down
[1:15:10] in there and he said when it' be the
[1:15:13] Moonlight brother Ben you heard this one
[1:15:16] before huh y'all man I knew
[1:15:20] it I was hoping I was hoping I was
[1:15:23] hoping I get him man
[1:15:27] brother sh you heard this one before
[1:15:29] brother a man them North West virgan
[1:15:37] boys anyways stole my thunder
[1:15:40] brother but they they uh brother BR say
[1:15:44] you you you you take that log and then
[1:15:46] he said in the Moonlight that raccoon
[1:15:49] been running that and when that raccoon
[1:15:50] sees something shiny it's going to stop
[1:15:53] and it's going to put its hand in there
[1:15:55] there and grab that 10 and guess what
[1:16:00] happens when he grabs that 10 his hand
[1:16:03] is bigger than those Nails that's been
[1:16:06] driven in and now he can't get it
[1:16:14] out now all that raccoon would have to
[1:16:17] do is let
[1:16:20] go and if he could let go he could just
[1:16:22] pull his hand out but that that raccoon
[1:16:25] is not smart enough to do
[1:16:29] that but I dare s to say that you are
[1:16:32] this
[1:16:35] morning because sometimes Satan traps us
[1:16:38] with shiny
[1:16:40] things sometimes things get a hold of us
[1:16:43] or we get a hold of it and we panic and
[1:16:46] we think oh but listen it is just that
[1:16:51] easy don't let Satan put one over on you
[1:16:55] all you got to do is let go of it
[1:16:59] amen you said brother don't don't no no
[1:17:03] no don't give Satan more credit than
[1:17:06] what he is do that's right we are
[1:17:09] speaking of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:11] this morning
[1:17:13] amen and Jesus he said he cast out
[1:17:16] Devils with the Finger of God
[1:17:19] yes so that's not even the hand of God
[1:17:22] just the
[1:17:23] finger that's how my he ain't worried
[1:17:26] about a devil and we ought not to be
[1:17:28] either all we have to do is let
[1:17:32] go you know it's so beautiful you know
[1:17:35] brother bam said that that uh whenever
[1:17:37] you whenever you repent you know he said
[1:17:41] he said all you have to do is um when
[1:17:46] you are forgiven in your heart I got it
[1:17:48] somewhere when he says when you when
[1:17:49] you're forgiven in your heart and you
[1:17:51] say Lord forgive me brother Brenham says
[1:17:54] your already forgiven the moment you're
[1:17:57] sorry brother Bron says the moment
[1:17:59] you're sorry in your heart you're
[1:18:02] already
[1:18:03] forgiven look I may have done something
[1:18:06] wrong and brother Manuel's over uh in in
[1:18:08] Congo and I can't get a hold of him he
[1:18:11] ain't got no sale reception and I'm
[1:18:13] texting away and and here I am
[1:18:16] panicking thinking he's got to get the
[1:18:18] text be you understand what I'm saying
[1:18:21] but there may not be any Sal service but
[1:18:23] you don't have to worry about whether
[1:18:25] they're Sal service or not because the
[1:18:28] prophet said the moment you're
[1:18:30] sorry in your heart you're already
[1:18:33] forgiven before God that's how God works
[1:18:38] that that the moment we can be not even
[1:18:41] vocalize it we realize we did something
[1:18:43] wrong and we're like oh our our heart is
[1:18:45] smoked within us the moment that happens
[1:18:48] and we say oh God why did
[1:18:53] I don't forget the moment that happens
[1:18:56] you young boys you young sisters the
[1:18:58] moment that happens you're already
[1:19:00] forgiven before God now brother Braham
[1:19:03] says you got to go make that right to be
[1:19:05] thoroughly
[1:19:07] repented but it's not like God's hanging
[1:19:09] over your head this carrot of
[1:19:11] forgiveness if you make it to this
[1:19:14] P but that's how is that how y'all
[1:19:16] perceive it sometimes am I the only
[1:19:18] one oh we got three people oh man praise
[1:19:21] the Lord y'all wow y'all are victorious
[1:19:24] okay
[1:19:26] well me and the other three people we
[1:19:28] struggle with that
[1:19:30] sometimes and the other 2 97 of you you
[1:19:35] pray for
[1:19:37] us you got plenty of time
[1:19:45] but but but that's why we have this
[1:19:48] message because it gives us
[1:19:51] courage when when when we can when we
[1:19:53] can look into God's Eternal
[1:19:56] Word we have to have confidence in what
[1:19:59] the word says about
[1:20:06] us but you but you know what no matter
[1:20:09] what no matter how much God forgives you
[1:20:15] look you have to accept
[1:20:23] it the the Bible tells us in Deuteronomy
[1:20:28] 176 that at the at the mouth of two
[1:20:31] witnesses or three witness shall he that
[1:20:34] is worthy of death be put to death but
[1:20:37] at the mouth of one witness yes he shall
[1:20:40] not be put to
[1:20:46] death so when you have done something
[1:20:49] that's worthy of
[1:20:53] death and Satan comes to cuz you know
[1:20:55] he's an accuser of the
[1:21:00] Brethren and Satan brings the
[1:21:04] accusation it does no good with only his
[1:21:08] witness but you know whose witness he
[1:21:11] needs he needs
[1:21:17] yours he needs another
[1:21:20] witness because the prophet told us God
[1:21:24] voted for
[1:21:25] you yes and Satan voted against
[1:21:29] you and now it depends upon where you
[1:21:32] put your
[1:21:38] vote if you say I'm unworthy and I'm all
[1:21:41] this and I'm listen stop
[1:21:44] stop
[1:21:46] stop you need to take inventory yes and
[1:21:51] you need to be honest with yourself and
[1:21:52] go wait a minute do I really believe God
[1:21:54] word or
[1:21:56] not because because just knowing about
[1:21:58] the Seven Seals and you know the seventh
[1:22:01] seal and what the fifth seal is and
[1:22:04] listen that's not going to help you if
[1:22:06] you got all these insecurities about
[1:22:07] what who you
[1:22:09] are you say brother Gabe but I've had I
[1:22:12] had a hard okay yeah you had a hard life
[1:22:15] I had too
[1:22:17] okay but what does that matter when it
[1:22:20] comes to God's word are you a believer
[1:22:23] of God's word or
[1:22:25] not and if you are a believer of God's
[1:22:28] word then you can go free am no matter
[1:22:31] what no matter what I don't care how bad
[1:22:34] it is I don't care look you want to you
[1:22:37] want to talk about somebody that had it
[1:22:38] bad you want to talk about somebody that
[1:22:40] had it bad it was
[1:22:43] Jaa God anybody know about
[1:22:45] Jaa Jaa ja that was in judges he was
[1:22:50] born the son of a
[1:22:52] harlot illegitimate
[1:23:02] he was under the Old Testament
[1:23:05] law
[1:23:10] excommunicated but then when they needed
[1:23:12] him they called him and he came back in
[1:23:15] and he won the victory he even messed up
[1:23:17] and said uh had said the Lord uh uh if
[1:23:20] you give me the victory whatever comes
[1:23:22] out of my house when I return I'll offer
[1:23:24] it for sacrifice and his daughter came
[1:23:28] out you want talk about messing up and
[1:23:31] and she was she was she was willing to
[1:23:34] be offered she said let me bewell my
[1:23:36] virginity for two months and for two
[1:23:38] months no doubt he waited no doubt
[1:23:41] wanting that Ram in the
[1:23:44] thicket but it never
[1:23:48] came but he was faithful to The Vow that
[1:23:51] he made to
[1:23:53] God and
[1:23:55] the amazing thing is is when it comes to
[1:23:58] the Hebrews of The Heroes of Faith in
[1:24:01] Hebrews 11 Paul would pin an
[1:24:04] illegitimate and remember they without
[1:24:08] us amen shall not be made perfect amen
[1:24:12] amen they it didn't say they except
[1:24:17] Jaa you know you know
[1:24:20] uh when I first when I first when I
[1:24:22] first got saved and I came to this
[1:24:24] message
[1:24:24] brother there's one quote where brother
[1:24:26] Bram talks about there's question asked
[1:24:27] about brother brandom does uh uh uh will
[1:24:31] a will IL illegitimate baby uh go in a
[1:24:34] Rapture and uh this brother the way he
[1:24:36] had presented it to me presented to me
[1:24:38] that if they was illegitimate there's no
[1:24:39] way they can be saved or they can be
[1:24:41] saved but there's no way they can be
[1:24:43] bride and uh and when that was presented
[1:24:46] to me I was a
[1:24:48] Youngster
[1:24:50] uh it it it terrified me
[1:24:55] and uh I I I'll be honest with you I
[1:25:00] uh cuz I don't I don't have to go very
[1:25:03] far to to to find that in my family
[1:25:06] tree and you know whenever he whenever
[1:25:08] he shared that quote with me I thought
[1:25:13] man maybe that's the reason why I got
[1:25:15] all the problems that I
[1:25:17] got maybe I'm illegitimate maybe that's
[1:25:20] the
[1:25:21] problem you know what I was so tormented
[1:25:24] by by that quote and the way that that
[1:25:27] Minister presented it to
[1:25:31] me that I called Mom and I was trying to
[1:25:35] ask her in a roundabout way and without
[1:25:39] you
[1:25:40] know then I called grandma grandma and
[1:25:44] she verified yes your mom and dad was
[1:25:47] married when you were born when yeah
[1:25:52] okay but you know what
[1:25:55] after I found that out guess what still
[1:25:58] had the same
[1:26:01] problems nothing magically faded away
[1:26:04] because I could prove cuz I could
[1:26:07] justify Myself by that
[1:26:09] quote
[1:26:12] right and and may maybe and you know uh
[1:26:17] maybe uh maybe you that quote still
[1:26:20] sticks to you but if you studied out I
[1:26:23] got about 66 or 6 62 pages of quotes and
[1:26:28] scriptures to go with it uh Moab and
[1:26:31] Ammon and amonites they they Moab and
[1:26:33] Amon they weren't even able to go into
[1:26:35] the Temple of the congregation
[1:26:38] forever illegitimate had to wait 14
[1:26:41] Generations Moab and who is
[1:26:44] Ruth amen Ruth is a moabit yeah but but
[1:26:49] anyways not trying to go not trying to
[1:26:51] go that way but my point is jafa had
[1:26:53] some hard things against
[1:26:56] him but even though everything was
[1:26:58] counted against
[1:27:00] him when it's all said and done he's in
[1:27:04] Hebrews 11 with the Heroes of Faith
[1:27:07] amen
[1:27:11] amen and the Bible says they they they
[1:27:15] they without us shall not be that's
[1:27:17] including Jaa jaa's there and how if Jaa
[1:27:21] could have that kind of Faith under the
[1:27:22] blood of bus and goats what ought we to
[1:27:25] have if you do have some type of
[1:27:27] illegitimacy in your
[1:27:30] background because we are not saved by
[1:27:32] Blood and Bulls and ghats we're saved by
[1:27:34] the blood of God the almighty one that's
[1:27:37] right amen
[1:27:40] yes so by the way Jaa even his name Jaa
[1:27:44] means whom God sets
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:27:51] free amen
[1:27:54] I I just to to me friends all I'm trying
[1:27:57] to say is this no matter what you're
[1:27:59] struggling with today there is no excuse
[1:28:03] that you can't come Victorious today
[1:28:05] there's no reason for any one of us to
[1:28:09] leave this Sanctuary beat down tore down
[1:28:12] distracted whatever it may be there is
[1:28:15] no
[1:28:16] reason
[1:28:19] because even if you do only see yourself
[1:28:24] as something as little and insignificant
[1:28:27] as a worm God's mindful enough to have a
[1:28:30] type in Shadow just for you
[1:28:32] amen just to help you with your
[1:28:35] insecurities just to help you with your
[1:28:38] shortcomings and how little you feeling
[1:28:41] I can't see myself as a lamb I can't see
[1:28:43] myself as a lion I can't see myself as
[1:28:46] an eagle
[1:28:48] okay that's
[1:28:50] fine let's start with a worm
[1:28:54] and when you get the worm down you're
[1:28:57] going to get a little bit of Courage
[1:28:58] about you you're going to have a little
[1:29:00] bit you're going to go oh I'm a bloody
[1:29:04] worm I'm a crimson worm I can do
[1:29:10] that I can give my life I can do that
[1:29:14] too and then as you walk in this thing
[1:29:17] called life you'll
[1:29:20] mature and then you'll start seeing
[1:29:22] yourself as a lamb
[1:29:24] yes and guess what we'll all be waiting
[1:29:27] here for
[1:29:28] you till you change and transform and
[1:29:33] you get your
[1:29:37] wings and then you realize I am an
[1:29:40] eagle because listen we ain't going to
[1:29:42] leave until you get it right right and
[1:29:45] that's fine because the Saints of old
[1:29:47] had waited so many years for me I'm
[1:29:50] willing to wait for you and if I'm the
[1:29:53] one that's holding you back I hope
[1:29:54] you're willing to wait for me
[1:29:56] too because we have all got to get to
[1:29:58] the place where we stop living this beat
[1:30:01] down defeated life look the Bible tells
[1:30:04] us and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:30:07] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:30:09] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[1:30:10] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[1:30:13] washed us from our own sins in his blood
[1:30:17] that washed means to be
[1:30:21] loosed and that's what the blood of the
[1:30:23] AL might he does it looses us amen it
[1:30:27] sets us free amen and we can be free
[1:30:30] indeed this morning do y'all believe
[1:30:32] that oh
[1:30:34] my but but the thing of it is we have to
[1:30:38] get past all you know and I'm I'm I know
[1:30:44] I'm at an hour 15 so I'm I'm I'm wind it
[1:30:47] up watch this you know you think
[1:30:51] about you think about speaking the word
[1:30:58] and I'm going don't look up stop reading
[1:31:01] stop
[1:31:04] reading but when we think about speaking
[1:31:06] the word I that's okay I I just to me I
[1:31:08] found this the other day came across it
[1:31:10] listening to the message and it was so
[1:31:12] beautiful to me that when brother
[1:31:14] brenham's talking about Moses speaking
[1:31:16] the word why you cry don't cry speak the
[1:31:18] word and go forward amen and and I want
[1:31:21] you to think about what type
[1:31:25] of a condition do you need to be in to
[1:31:27] speaking the word brother we got to be
[1:31:29] in Rapture condition to speak the word
[1:31:31] and go forward right that's a in our
[1:31:34] mind in our message mentality that's
[1:31:36] what we think we got to we got to be in
[1:31:39] condition brother speak the word we're
[1:31:43] heals well let's listen to the message
[1:31:45] and see what brother bam says about
[1:31:47] it because brother brandham tells us he
[1:31:50] said then the
[1:31:52] Lord said why you crying to me can
[1:31:56] commission I commission you to do it
[1:31:58] speak to the children that they may are
[1:32:00] go in the line of duty amen there you
[1:32:02] are don't cry out to me you're
[1:32:04] commissioned to take these people over
[1:32:06] there just speak to them that they go
[1:32:08] forward and stay straight in the path of
[1:32:10] Duty amen what a courage that ought to
[1:32:13] be for the sick
[1:32:16] person
[1:32:18] amen
[1:32:21] what what
[1:32:26] well hold on you in the back s you can't
[1:32:28] be speaking no there's a 90-day waiting
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:40] period you got to wait three to five
[1:32:42] business days before you're holy enough
[1:32:45] after you repent that's
[1:32:47] weep that's how we think right we do
[1:32:50] something wrong and then we got that
[1:32:51] three to five waiting and it's business
[1:32:54] day so weekends don't count
[1:33:00] so if you can't say Amen say
[1:33:04] ouch I
[1:33:06] me don't tell me I'm the only one that
[1:33:09] got the three to five business
[1:33:12] days and you're like oh it's a holiday
[1:33:15] ah I can't speak the word
[1:33:17] sorry ah man boy there was a situation I
[1:33:22] could have nah it's not been long long
[1:33:23] enough
[1:33:26] yet no that's what we do up
[1:33:30] here and that is totally wrong that's
[1:33:34] right cuz we are message Believers right
[1:33:37] and and it's not your message that we
[1:33:39] you need to be
[1:33:41] believing it it's it's the message of
[1:33:44] Malachi 4 and so he tells us what a
[1:33:48] courage that ought to be for the
[1:33:52] backslider
[1:33:55] amen remember in prayer lines remember
[1:33:58] brother B said you need to repent now he
[1:34:01] said once you repent he said if if you
[1:34:03] stand up here and confess sin I'm going
[1:34:04] to call it out the Lord will call it out
[1:34:07] right but the moment they would
[1:34:13] confess there was no three to five
[1:34:15] business days
[1:34:19] there he says turn yourself around
[1:34:25] and start back stay in the line of duty
[1:34:28] it's God's business to open up the Red
[1:34:31] Seas it's God's business you just speak
[1:34:35] and move
[1:34:37] forward that's all you have to do am is
[1:34:43] just speak the word and go
[1:34:47] forward I am forgiven amen
[1:34:54] you can say
[1:34:57] it I am
[1:34:59] justified I never done it in the first
[1:35:02] place amen that's all on
[1:35:05] Satan he is My Sacrifice amen and you
[1:35:09] you may look at your path of life and
[1:35:13] and here's another one I came across it
[1:35:15] just blessed me so much brother brandom
[1:35:17] he's talking about he saved me when
[1:35:18] there were millions of others in sin he
[1:35:20] saved me for some reason they were
[1:35:22] educated there were smart men there were
[1:35:24] theologians there were Bishops and
[1:35:26] doctors and so forth in the field when
[1:35:28] he saved me but he saved me for some
[1:35:30] purpose and I see the word is the
[1:35:32] absolute and I'm tied to it determined
[1:35:33] to know nothing else but Jesus Christ
[1:35:35] and him crucified he had a reason for it
[1:35:37] and I'm determined to hold to that
[1:35:39] reason no matter what anybody else says
[1:35:42] I don't just fellowship with him
[1:35:43] discredit them but I know what I'm tied
[1:35:45] to he wanted
[1:35:47] me like
[1:35:49] this he had me like this I was made like
[1:35:53] that for a purpose I had to be made up
[1:35:56] of all these qualities and so forth all
[1:36:00] these no
[1:36:06] accounts so he could dig it out of me
[1:36:09] amen amen amen
[1:36:11] what see we look at our life and go why
[1:36:14] did this happen to me and why that and
[1:36:17] why why
[1:36:20] why it had to be that way amen you had
[1:36:24] to have all of those qualities within
[1:36:27] you so that God could dig it out of you
[1:36:30] and then put something in you which is
[1:36:32] his word
[1:36:34] amen praise God Amen so so the point of
[1:36:38] it is is I hope as it changes your focus
[1:36:42] to stop looking at your light your life
[1:36:44] as a
[1:36:45] negative and look at it and see that God
[1:36:48] is making it a positive
[1:36:55] all these no accounts and so forth so he
[1:36:58] could dig it out of
[1:37:07] me but we have to get
[1:37:10] past our
[1:37:14] thoughts and we can stand
[1:37:20] together and as we stand and close on
[1:37:23] this scripture
[1:37:24] musicians have
[1:37:27] become very familiar portion of
[1:37:30] scripture in Jeremiah
[1:37:34] 29:11 God says for I know the thoughts
[1:37:37] that I think towards you sath the Lord
[1:37:40] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:37:44] give you an expected
[1:37:48] end and that expected end is actually
[1:37:51] speaking of a
[1:37:55] and it's that same Hebrew
[1:37:58] word that refers to the line of the
[1:38:01] Scarlet
[1:38:03] thread that when Rahab threw that
[1:38:06] expected end out the
[1:38:09] window it brought freedom and
[1:38:13] liberty it brought them
[1:38:16] Deliverance it brought them safety
[1:38:20] amen and this morning friends look we we
[1:38:23] are
[1:38:24] not just in this life hoping that uh you
[1:38:31] know Donald J Trump becomes the
[1:38:34] president so we can make it another four
[1:38:39] years we play something softly
[1:38:43] brother but we ought to
[1:38:46] realize that there's a Scarlet thread of
[1:38:49] redemption yes amen amen it was before
[1:38:53] your your life in your life and it's
[1:38:55] going to be after your life if God
[1:38:59] carries God knows the the thoughts that
[1:39:04] he thought of
[1:39:05] [Music]
[1:39:07] you you was tied with his thoughts of
[1:39:11] peace with his thoughts of
[1:39:15] redemption you say brother Gabe I I know
[1:39:18] I know but I
[1:39:20] struggle well so do I
[1:39:25] but I'm so thankful
[1:39:28] that one day when I was staring at a
[1:39:30] computer I clicked on a little
[1:39:33] [Music]
[1:39:36] worm and that little worm transformed my
[1:39:42] life you don't know the
[1:39:48] torment that I went through
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:39:57] but I
[1:39:58] knew that this message was the only
[1:40:01] thing that was
[1:40:04] life and when brothers would present
[1:40:07] quotes to me and I didn't man I didn't
[1:40:09] know nothing I mean I was fresh off the
[1:40:13] streets I was a you think I'm a you
[1:40:16] think I got some ghetto in me now you
[1:40:18] should have seen me about 20 years ago
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:29] but when I would read that quote and it
[1:40:30] was the way the man would present it to
[1:40:33] me and I thought man there's no hope for
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:45] me sometimes we go you know the amazing
[1:40:48] thing is is God will allow those things
[1:40:50] to happen for years but it's just a Tri
[1:40:53] of your faith because then he'll show
[1:40:55] you something it'll lock everything and
[1:40:58] then you you'll look back and you go
[1:41:00] wait a minute how did I hold
[1:41:03] on and then you
[1:41:07] realize Ro it was it wasn't it wasn't
[1:41:10] you that was holding on it was God that
[1:41:12] was holding on to you brother all them
[1:41:16] years all those wasted hours and minutes
[1:41:24] why is it it's because this message is
[1:41:27] the only thing that's
[1:41:28] life and I couldn't understand it but I
[1:41:32] knew it was
[1:41:34] right and I look at my life and I see by
[1:41:38] God's grace I I see that Crimson
[1:41:44] thread and I see those thoughts that he
[1:41:46] thought to of
[1:41:48] me
[1:41:50] me they were thoughts of peace and not
[1:41:54] of
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:55] evil and everything that we go through
[1:41:58] in life if you would really look at it
[1:42:00] it's molding you and shaping you for a
[1:42:04] purpose and I'll be honest with you when
[1:42:07] you catch that Revelation brother Mike
[1:42:10] it makes your life have such a a a
[1:42:13] solidity about it that you realize wait
[1:42:16] a minute I am in the hand of the
[1:42:20] Redeemer I do have that Scarlet thread
[1:42:23] wrapped around
[1:42:27] me and it and it gives you that quiet
[1:42:30] confidence that that though you may have
[1:42:32] a life of of Rahab the Harlot there was
[1:42:36] a line of a Scarlet thread that was let
[1:42:39] out and you was able to climb out of
[1:42:42] that old life
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:46] amen ain't you thankful this
[1:42:49] morning when we didn't understand and we
[1:42:51] had confusion God God was faithful
[1:42:54] through it
[1:42:55] all when we when we went through life
[1:42:58] and all kind of problems and we had all
[1:43:00] kind of misunderstandings how many times
[1:43:02] did we misquote the prophet misinterpret
[1:43:06] the prophet and God was faithful through
[1:43:09] it
[1:43:12] all
[1:43:16] why because he was before you in you and
[1:43:20] after you
[1:43:23] because we are seed of
[1:43:25] David because we are
[1:43:28] not that worm of Decay and rot and
[1:43:34] death but we all come from that little
[1:43:36] Crimson
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:40] worm that's why when he would call us a
[1:43:43] worm we would say yay
[1:43:46] Lord Oh Lord just let me be a worm You
[1:43:51] Know the Way Up Is Down
[1:43:54] am and if you can throw out your chest
[1:43:57] and see yourself as an eagle you needed
[1:43:59] this message this
[1:44:02] morning cuz when you look in the mirror
[1:44:04] you need to stop seeing the eagle you
[1:44:06] need to see yourself as a
[1:44:07] worm you got way too much pride about
[1:44:10] you and you brother sister that look at
[1:44:13] yourself and see yourself less as a worm
[1:44:15] you need to buckle up and get a little
[1:44:17] bit of Courage about you and shake off
[1:44:19] them complexes and go no yeah I'm a worm
[1:44:23] I'm GNA start there and then build
[1:44:28] up but don't live a defeated
[1:44:31] life we are called to live a Victorious
[1:44:35] life no matter how little and
[1:44:37] insignificant we may be there is no
[1:44:40] reason for us to live a defeated
[1:44:43] life if the Hubble if man can make a
[1:44:46] telescope that can look out millions of
[1:44:49] miles of of light years and and see all
[1:44:53] all these beautiful things and And when
[1:44:55] they see them and they put in they don't
[1:44:57] see the eye of God but we
[1:45:00] do they don't see a hand of God but we
[1:45:03] do they see a Red Ribbon in the Sky but
[1:45:07] we see a crimson
[1:45:10] streak why because we have prophetic
[1:45:14] Vision because we've had a prophet we
[1:45:17] are we are living in the in the days
[1:45:19] when these eyes have shined forth in the
[1:45:21] light of his word and if we can be
[1:45:24] simple enough and humble enough God will
[1:45:26] make this word live in ways that we

[1:45:47] that he thought of us was thoughts of
[1:45:51] Peace not of
[1:45:54] evil what we've been through in this

[1:46:20] uh had a horse and it fell in a
[1:46:24] hole the farmer had no way of getting
[1:46:27] that horse
[1:46:29] out and so the hor so the
[1:46:32] farmer looks at that horse and he grabs
[1:46:36] a
[1:46:38] shovel and just starts throwing dirt on
[1:46:41] it just going to bury the
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:50] horse I think about Brother D right now

[1:46:54] forck remember that the P forck anybody
[1:46:57] know what the pa forck is that's a bag
[1:47:00] you put over your shoulder and it's got
[1:47:02] a hole in it that whatever you got in
[1:47:04] there you throw it in that pffa sock
[1:47:06] brother Dan it tell me you throw that
[1:47:08] pffa sock remember that pffa sock he
[1:47:11] said he said when you going through
[1:47:12] something in life you got a pffa sock
[1:47:15] and you throw you throw whatever's in
[1:47:17] that bag and you throw that pffa sock
[1:47:19] over your shoulder cuz it falls out it
[1:47:22] falls out behind you and that's what
