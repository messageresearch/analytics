ourselves privileged Lord to be able to gather like this Lord with our Brethren Lord to worship you to sing your Praises lord it's a it's a special privilege of ours that you've given us in this hour to Worship in spirit and in truth God as we've come to listen listen to this tape to listen to what your Prophet has brought us Lord that I pray God that you would just anoint us with ears to hear that we'd receive all that you have for this in this hour may it be a blessed time that we get to share together Lord as we gather around your word we pray that you bless us from the beginning to the end all the comments and everything that's said may it be pleasing to you we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you we're going to let you have your seats for just a minute thank you musicians amen we going to go into our tape service um brother Frank if you can bring it up oh thank you also I want to make note that tomorrow brother Ron Garvin and brother John Brooks leave for their trip to the Philippines and Japan so we want to remember to pray for them and at the end of the service I'd like them to come up and we can all pray together for them as we send them off into the mission field amen so I'm excited to see what God will do for them they got quite an itinerary they're going to be gone I believe 18 days and so really be praying for them and for their families as well as they're absent um as you know I I like every year to take a book and go through a book together I always look forward to it I hope you do as well I enjoy it anyways amen uh this book this year is is your life worthy of the Gospel if you didn't get a copy the copies are out by the welcome desk you can run out and grab one quickly if you need one but we're going to it's going to take us three services to get through this uh this message three Wednesday nights in a row so bring your book each time don't forget just slip it in your Bible and bring it with you as we go uh most all of you are familiar but I I go through it every time for those who are new and also for the young ones who start to get interested in having the message for themselves and reading it for themselves as they grow older but on this uh back wall uh in the forer as you go out the doors just to the right there's this book rack we have here in the the on The Book Rack the top uh six titles never change and if you remember those are six titles that I asked everybody in the congregation to read in order and the order they're placed there from left to right because it's so fundamental to understanding what God did in our day and the transition of brother brenham's Ministry so if you haven't read them through in that order in a while if it's been 5 six seven years you might want to take note and go back through it and and those of you young who are coming up and you've just started to read the message for yourself I would encourage you to go there as well or anybody who hasn't then the this row on the bottom those we change out from time to time periodically but I've just got six new titles so every year uh brother uh John pittsburger helps me order six new titles and we put them on the bottom rack so that there's six fresh new books there now the way we'd like to do this is we want everybody who wants to to take a book and read it through but I just ask you don't go through and pull all six books just take one or two and read the entire book and then go back and get another one and that way every book you have in your personal library is a book you read yourself and it's exciting now that everybody has an opportunity to build their own book Library so we got six new titles for this year uh but I checked and if I if my number is right in the library we now have 59 titles we keep on hand so if you've been following along over the last however many years has been about six years we've been doing this and you've gotten books each year and you've read them all then your personal book library now is up to 60 books that you've read yourself so you can see little by little the young people the teenagers can start to to build this on their own and I certainly don't think you should only have ever done 60 books but it's just nice to have the for me there's something about having the books that I really enjoy and a lot of people enjoy the digital format and that's fine as well but I like having books on hand and it's still nice uh just as a note while we're on the subject if you ever want to pass out material if you want to give a church age book to somebody you want to give a message book to somebody they're all in the library all you got to do is take one and give it away you don't need permission you don't need to pay for it nothing there is for sale all of it's paid for out of the general fund and the offerings the offerings people give by all the books so you're welcome to take literature material you want to pass out and pass it out if you want something for yourself just take it it's there it doesn't do any good sitting on that shelf it only does good when it's read and absorbed by somebody so it's there for us to use these are the six new titles for this year is your life worthy the gospel which is the book we're going to go over together the statue of a perfect man Blasphemous names God is identified by his characteristics marriage and divorce and souls that are in prison now so those are the six books if you go into the library you'll see The Book Rack here right in the front as you enter in the books are all there but then we outgrew that space uh so sister Elsie has taken this uh shelf now behind the door so if you don't see the book you want turn around and look behind you it might be there it's much Fuller than it that was when I took that picture so those are the titles and those are where you go to get them so now the book that we're going over is is your life worthy of the Gospel uh before we get to the questions and if you're not familiar with with uh our tradition and the way they do it we're going to break the book down into small sections uh and those sections are approximately 4 5 minutes or so and before we listen to each section I'm going to ask a few questions and you can jot them down on paper you can have those questions and while we listen brother Venom's going to answer those questions uh in that section we listen to and that gives us all tuned in and listening for those answers and it's fun to see what he what he has to say and so what I always like to do and I say this every time but I'm never going to quit going through it cuz I like it I always start by picking up the book or opening the digital form out whatever it is and I look at the title is your life worthy of the gospel because I know that's what brother brandham is going to be preaching about and I like to hold that in my mind the whole time because remember sometimes brother Benham goes into Parables he tells stories he he goes on what looks like rabbit Trails amen he goes and what he's doing is he's everything he's preaching and everything he's talking about relates to is your life worthy of the Gospel so don't miss the stories either they're not just stories there's a reason that he telling it there's a reason that he wants us uh uh to include that in the message then I always look at the title in the book it's up in the upper leftand quarter 1963 June 30th in the evening it's an evening message 06 it's 63-0 630e that means 1963 June 30th in the evening the morning message was Third Exodus this morning that he preached this this he comes and he preaches in the evening I always do that because I like to know where in the sequence of events in the message brother Brandon preached this was this before the seals or after the seals what major events in his life were before or after this where was he in his ministry because to me that's relevant it's important to know where it is where he is in his ministry when he preaches this message the other thing I do is I open up the book to the front cover and I flip the page once to the inside title page and it and once again down on the bottom left there's some small writing it tells you the date the title but it said this message by Brother William Mariam brandham was delivered on Sunday evening June 30th 1963 at brandham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville Indiana USA I always want to know too where brother Brandon preached it because many times what he says is in relation to the people he's talking to he's trying to get the crowd he's talking to to understand what he's saying amen so sometimes when he's out in Evangelistic field he'll address things a different way than he does at home so I always like to know where he's at and then it tells us the tape number and it says this is 2 hours and 36 minutes so you get a lot of information there so we are going to to start this we're not going to start on page one because brother bam starts off with some greetings he has a baby dedication and some things like that so we're going to skip ahead so that we can fit it into three services not four but there's something I'd like to read on page one if you'll just open it up to page one with me and let's look at paragraph four brother brenham's in his opening prayer and he's imploring the Lord he said heal the sickness in the midst of us take away all sin and unbelief G give us of thy a portion of thy blessing again tonight Lord as we meditate upon the word and the time that we're living we have assembled together father for no other purpose but to try to learn how to live better and to live closer to you I love that what is the purpose of their assembling together this is the purpose this should be our purpose tonight why did we assemble together tonight we have assembled together father for no other purpose but to try to learn how to live better and to live closer to you for we see the day approaching and we must assemble ourselves together off and take instruction from you grant it father in Jesus name amen I just thought that was special and I wanted to read that and include that all right I'm going to go over the the questions for tonight we're actually going to begin on page8 so if you want to turn to page eight and then I'll go to our questions we're going to begin on page8 at the beginning of paragraph 29 and we will go all the way to page 21 at the bottom of paragraph 107 that's the portion we'll have tonight and I believe it's just a little over 40 minutes so we'll do that this evening now if you want to get a note in the paper I'm going to give you a couple questions we're just going to do three tonight because of the preliminaries I'm not going to uh have many more than that but question number one is why is this nation doomed and if you always notice sometimes the way I ask a question it's worded funny or it seems like an odd question it's because of the way brother brandham says something or addresses it and once you hit it you'll know exactly why the question is worded the way it is why is this nation doomed question number two what separates you from God and like we said before if you just answer that question you can give me a myriad of question answers and they'll all be right but what we're looking for is what brother bam says in this portion that we're listening to that he says separates you from God and then the third question is what kind of a life is not worthy what kind of a life is not worthy so those are your questions I'm also going to encourage you just because we're listening to a tape doesn't mean this isn't word the word and doesn't mean it's not worthy of a hearty amen when it strikes your heart so don't be afraid to respond to the word like you would any time when it strikes you amen and that amen's inside let it come out of your mouth amen cuz the atmosphere that we create is what makes us such a special time we can all go home and listen to a tape and we can all break it into segments we can do that but there's something about the atmosphere we create together it really does something for us and I find it extremely encouraging to hear somebody's Amen to the word that's blessing me as well amen so we create an atmosphere together and so don't be afraid to respond to the word I also like to read uh the scripture brother B's going to go to an opening scripture but if you all would just turn in your Bibles with me I'd like for us to read it out of our own Bibles and see where he's going to we'll read it again in the book but let's turn to Luke chap 14 Luke chapter 14 we're going to read verse 16 it uh yeah Luke 14:16 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at supper time saying to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused and another said I have married a wife and there therefore I cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord those things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly unto the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the Halt and the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou Hast commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of these men which are bidden shall taste of my supper so I another thing that always strikes me and something that always pay attention to is when just as much as I look at the title to brother Brandon's message I always pay particularly close attention to his opening scripture because his opening scripture and his title go together and sometimes you can't see how they go together but they go together and that's what will become more alive to us as we get into this message amen so if we can let's go to page 8 page 8 paragraph 29 we can go ahead and begin if you want to turn that on brother Franco now tonight I wanted to make another tape uh that was called is your life worthy of the Gospel probably wouldn't take very long on just some scriptures and notes I got here but first we want to read God's word before we do that we just bow our hearts to him just a moment Lord Jesus any man physically or woman or child can move back the P pages of this Bible but there's no one that can reveal it but you I pray Lord of taking this text as is placed upon my heart to send out across the Nations for the people that they might know what type of life is required of them to live for so many has asked me is a Christian Life a life of church service is it helping uh the poor or the needy or is it a constant member is it a loyal loyalty to the church in such questions father may it the correct answer come tonight through these words as we make an Endeavor to to bring them to the people in the name of Jesus Christ we ask that amen now turning your Bibles to the book of St Luke and we'll start at the 14th chapter and the 16th verse to read some scripture for a basis for a background for this that we're going to TI a lot about 30 to 40 minutes on now the 16th verse of the 14th chapter of St Luke then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bed many and sent his servants at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for for all things are now ready and they all with one Accord begin to make excuses the first said unto him I bought a piece of ground and I must need go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five y yolk of ox and I go to prove them I pray they have me excused another said I've married a wife therefore I cannot come so the servant came and showed his Lord all these things then the master of the house being angry said to to his servant notice it's not servant servant go out quickly into the streets and the lanes and the cities and bring in hither the poor and the main and the Halt and the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compare tell them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper now did you notice there was three pools or three turns of it when they went out first and called to them that were uh or bidden to come and they didn't do it so they went out of healing t campaign went out to get to Blind and Hal and still they were room so he went out and compell the good bad and indifferent they should come in now you read another parable of this something on in Matthew 22 1 to10 if you'd like to read it later on but I I drew this subject from there uh is your life worthy of the Gospel now now Jesus here is saying man has always tried to make excuses not to receive God's word of his invitation though it be firmly proven to him that it's that it's his supper and his invitation but man is constantly making excuses and if you read St Matthew uh 22 you'll find that the excuses were made there also and and they tried it went back into all ages went back into the age and said a man a bid them and had a Vineyard and we find that Parable and how he sent his servants to collect from this Vineyard first servant come what did they do they run him off the next servant come they also Stone him and there run servant after servant off the cruel man the king sent finally his son and when his son came we find out that they said this is an air we'll kill him then we'll have all things then Jesus said to them the king sent forth and slew those murderers and burnt their cities now we see when God gives a man an invitation and to do something or to receive the invitation that he's given him and he returns it down then there's nothing left after Mercy is spurn but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy then there's only one thing left and that is judgment and we find that man has done that in all ages it's happened most every age in the Bible when God sent Noah his servant and made an way of an escape for all the people who wanted to to be saved but the people only laughed and scorned at Noah but God made the way but they had an excuse it wasn't according to their to their modern thinking it didn't it wasn't the way they wanted it so they made excuses in the days of Noah they made excuses in the days of Moses they made excuses in the Days of Elijah they made excuses in the days of Christ and they make excuses today now him speaking directly to Israel the ones that was called To The Feast that I would also apply today to the man the church who has been bidden to come to the feast and won't do it this spiritual Feast of the Lord and they won't do it they don't want to do it they've got other things to do they find excuses now if Israel 2,000 years ago would accepted the invitation that they were given they wouldn't be as they are today 2,000 years ago Israel turned down the invitation to come to the wedding supper and they turned it down and went into judgment but as Jesus said they stoned and killed the prophets that was sent to them um by making excuses now the excuses they made in each day we find in the days of Jesus that he didn't he didn't affiliate with any of them they said when did this man get this learning what school is he from is not this the carpenter son is his mother called Mary is his brothers Jo and James so forth and isn't his sisters with us then where did this man get this authority to do this in other words he didn't affiliate with him so they said he's beab he's a Samaritan he's got a devil and he's mad he's a he's a he's a man that's got a evil spirit on the line of religion and has drove him crazy and that's what he's out there like a wild man don't pay any attention to him and we know what happened to Israel and they screamed out they were so sure that that man was wrong until on when they condemned him he said he said let his blood be upon us and upon our children and it's been there ever since Jesus was trying to tell them that they excuse is what kill the prophets and what kill the righteous that come they accepted their Creeds that man had given them instead of taking the word of God and by doing so had made the word of God of no effect now you've either got to say in this that this is God's Will and God's desire are either something else that you can crop up that's better than what this is and you have to take one or the other you can't serve God in man and you've got to say this is the truth or that's part of the truth or it isn't all the truth or it isn't put together right or it isn't interpreted right and the Bible said that the word of God is no private interpretation no one else is supposed to put an interpretation to it it's written just the way God wants it interpreted just what it says that that's what it's supposed to be just take it the way it's said way it's wrow down here now they accept their Creeds they make God's promises of no effect to them they bypass that just skip away from it now if Russia had accepted the Pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when the Holy Ghost fell in Russia they wouldn't have been Communists today now 75 years ago they had a great Revival in Russia God among them and they had great Revival way into Siberia and what did they do they rejected it and today the country is gone and the churches can't have church uh only under permission and they are doomed into judgment as gone off on this wild tantrum of Communism sold out to the devil 50 years ago the Holy Ghost in England just after that come George Jeff and FF Bosworth and Charles price Smith Wigglesworth those great warriors of the faith 50 years ago and offered England the Holy Ghost Revival but what did they do they laughed at him put him in jail called him crazy thought they lost your minds the churches refused the people to come hear them and they heal the sick and cast out devils and done great works and because that England as a nation rejected the gospel her her sins is know throughout all the world there's hardly a a more of an apostate a nation in all the world even including Rome and France that England she's a mother of apostasy right where uh finny and many of the great man preached in the hay market and Charles G finny and Wesley and on down and she turned it down and down even last week or two in the papers you find out where their great man has so weakened to the to the of women until spies come in and their head man found some more of them the magazines is packed their sin of Scandal right in their government has sold their disgraceful Name Across the world why she rejected the truth she had her excuse and she's finished England is all washed up with God a long time ago ago if America 15 years ago when the Great healing Revival continued on from Pentecost broke out in the nation and there was a revivals on the capital Washington DC the presidents vice presidents great people Governors great things taking place Governors and and man were he that Congressman Upshaw had been a for for 66 years and they could not turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before but they turned it down and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she's doomed there's no hope for it at all she's crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's lected in what she has here to control the nation and she's rotten to the core her politics is rotten the morals of this nation is lower than anything I can think of and a religious system is rottener than the morals she becomes and doing this she has now joined herself all these churches and the the nation into the Federation of churches and taking the mark of the beast what a thing why Christ give them the opportunity come to my Feast the Feast of Pentecost which means 50 when the Holy Spirit poured out on Russia they was called To A Feast of Pentecost spiritual feast and they turned it down England a Holy Ghost is poured out upon them and they turned it down America the Holy Ghost H was poured out upon them and they turned it down he bid three times three times he sent out and they did not listen to The Feast then he sent again and he said go and compel those people to come the tables got to be set the table's ready to still room and I believe that maybe maybe within the next year few months or something or a year or whatever it is God's going to send another shaking across the country for the somebody still out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere somewhere in the world the nation itself is gone I was looking in this week's Life Magazine down at the where down at the Little Rock or the other day or a rather Hot Springs and there I seen I believe it was a governor of the state of New York with some kind of a strip tees over in huah dancing with her now and here below that was another renowned man oh what a disgrace look at our nation today look at the condition of our of our nation look where she's went to how low she sunk look at our religious system today how can it be that the churches can ever get into the condition that they are now is because they have rejected and refused the message of God the invitation to come to the feast could you call a life like that worthy of the Gospel could you call a life that could set and permit their their people to do the things to smoke cigarettes the other day down here a certain church a little league team was playing down here at the park and my brother-in-law's little boy is a pitcher uh for one of the teams and so he was out there pitching and there was a church league playing and there was the pastor with these little fellas out there on the ground playing and the pastor smoked cigarette after cigarette of a real neighborly church right here by and could you imagine a man and even people sitting in the audience noticed it but it's getting so that they don't even pay attention to it a certain great church a Baptist Church that I know of lets a church out from Sunday school 15 extra minutes so that the pastor and all of them can stand outside and smoke before they come back in to serve the duty of the law John Smith the founder of that church prayed so hard that God sent the Revival till his eyes swoll shut at night and his wife had to lead him to the table and feed him with a spoon if that man would turn over in his grave if he know that church had got in that condition what is it they were bidden to come and turned it down right that's the only thing and you remember Jesus said in here that those that were bidden and turned it down would not taste his supper when God sends the Holy Ghost and knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometime he's going to turn it for his last time and then you won't be a privileged character you can sit in the church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel you might do so much to say I know it's right but never put a finger on on it to help it yourself see you just listen to it cuz you say I believe it's right that's just sympathizing with it I can say I believe that's a $10,000 that don't mean I got it see I could say it's good cold water but refuse to drink it you know what I mean and this is eternal life and to refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and then you won't be have the privilege to come and receive it to you people who come here I'm not responsible for those who are are other ministers are speaking to but if it's right you owe your life to it what more could you ever find that would be more of a benefit to you than to know that you can have eternal life amen amen what if I was giving away capsules here that scientifically proven scientifically proven that this capsule would make you live a thousand years well I I'd have to get a militia out here and and swarm away from the place you wouldn't have to make an alter call for it you just have to beat them away from it to live a thousand years and yet scientifically proven that the Eternal God all his power of His resurrections which promis you eternal life and Satan will put his Legions out there and keep you away from it that's right yet you can look and sensible enough look in the face of it and see it's right but then turn it down see something some kind of an excuse it's too hard I'm too tired I will tomorrow just some kind of an excuse that's all they do by rejecting the day of visitation it separates you from God now we noticed in in the Old Testament they had what they call the Jubilee year that was when all the people that was slaves could go free when the Jubilee sounded and then if the man did not go out if there was some excuse that he could give that he didn't want to return to his land then he had to be marked in the ear with an a by the post in the temple and then no matter how many jubilees come along that man was sold out he could never no more come back as a citizen in Israel no more what did he do he rejected his invitation he didn't have to pay nothing the debt of his slavery was over his family was free he could go right back to his homeland and get his own possession but if he refused to do it then he wasn't lotted no more with Israel and his possession was given to another now the same thing in the natural applies to the spiritual that if we as inheritance of eternal life and we hear the gospel and know that is true and we reject it and refuse to do it are to listen to it we take on the mark of the beast now somebody said now there's going to be a a mark of the beast is going to come someday let me tell you it's already come as soon as the Holy Ghost Begin to Fall the mark of the beast begin to take place see you only have two things one of them is accept it takes the Seal of God to reject it takes the mark of the beast to reject the Seal of God is to take the mark of the beast everybody understand to reject the Seal of God is to take the mark of the beast for the Bible said all that was not sealed by the Seal of God took the mark of the beast when the trumpet sounded and all wanted to go freak could go them it didn't was marked now you see the mark of the beast if we talk about it in the future is when it's going to be made manifest when you realize that what you've already done see and so is the holy spirit it's to be manifested when we see the Lord Jesus coming in glory and feel that transforming power and see the Dead Rising out of the grave and know that a second longer we'll be changed and have a body like his Lord it'll be made manifest then to see those who rejected it will be left down out didn't Jesus said The Virgins went out to meet Christ some of them fell asleep the first watch second third fourth fifth sixth to the seventh watch but in the seventh watch then came forth the sound behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him and the ones that were sleeping awakened all the age back to Pentecost woke up see from the seventh age of seven Church age all the way back through woke up and these that were in this church age of living they were changed and they went in at the very time they went in the sleeping virgin come and said we want to buy some of your or but they said we just got enough for our s go to them and sell it and while they were trying to receive this AA the bridegroom came there has never been a time in the history of the world that theist episcopalians Baptists methodists Presbyterians the papers are full the religious papers are praising God that those sleeping virgins are now trying to receive Pentecost trying to receive the Holy Ghost and don't the people realize that it will not happen according to the word of God while they were trying to come back the bridegroom and took away the bride and they were cast into outer Darkness for judgment Lord because they rejected their invitation all people are bidden to come God in every age has sent out his light and it's been rejected and now today is no different from any other day to reject the day of the visitation when God is making a visit to the church and to the people re receive it then don't put it off the next year the next Revival that's the hour today is the day of salvation and remember God has never sent a message in any day but what he Vindicated it with the supernatural Jesus said himself if I do not the works of my father then believe me not but if I do the works you believe the works if you can't believe me when you see it clearly cut and and made manifest now the time has come that she rejects it then she's bored in the ear with an awe then she'll never hear it now she takes herself to the confederation of churches to go right in to take the mark of the beast one of the great Ambitions somebody give me the paper and just now this new Pulpit said is to unite the churches together yes they'll do it just as certain as I'm standing you're and a Protestant fall part see because the church it the Bible said Paul the prophet of the Lord said that day will not come except there come a falling away first and then the man before the man of sin will be revealed he that Seth in the temple of God opposing himself all that's above God he as God forgiving sins on the earth and so forth how that this thing happened but it couldn't happen until the falling away until the church began to get away from the spiritual Feast draw itself back and organize itself and then the Revelation didn't stay with the church remember Israel walked Day and Night by the pillar of fire when that Pillar of Fire moved they moov with it and remember it was a fire at night and a cloud of day so it might come day or night anytime but wherever it was there was a propitiation made that they would not fail to see it it was a light at night and a cloud in the daytime and they followed it yes sir that's same thing Martin Luther saw it what did he do he come out of Catholicism but what did they do they build a little fence around said we're lutherans this is it then Wesley saw it moving away from there he went what they do build a little fence around and said this is it what did I do moved right on again Pentecost saw it what they do moved out of the wesling in Nazareth and so forth what do they do they build a fence call we're Oneness and we're Trinity and we're the United and all this what did he do God moved right on out of it am see we cannot do that we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen if we don't we take an organizational life and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy a man that's a Christian on Sunday and goes to church sits back there and thinks he owns the church because he does this that or the other and on Monday will steal and lie and women that'll go out on the public beaches and and out upon the streets with immoral clothes on I thought of our the first lady wouldn't even put on makeup to go before the pope and come back and set a Waterhead haircut uh uh spring for the women in the nation and all these uh dresses that when she's become mother every woman in the country wants to wear one of them uh mother type dresses now that's right it's examples and they know that those people would do that they take on a spirit of the world and that don't belong in the Church of the Living God praise the Lord women ought to look to Jesus Christ you ought to look to Sarah in name of the Old Testament yes now they got so that I was preaching the other night somewhere about a women to obey their husband ohy that went out the marriage a long time ago but uh they ain't going to do that no sir they live in America and they let you know so they not going to obey but as long as you don't do it don't never try to call yourself a Christian cuz you're not I don't care how much you dance and speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of God and a woman that wears shorts and does these things that she does on the street don't call yourself a Christian you want to have the world and still hold your testimony you cannot do that in the presence of God when you know better than to do it notice bored in the air marked away then you'll never hear remember that's a sign of closing the ears you won't hear it no more you won't listen You'll never be able to get to it again oh she don't believe that oh my don't tell her she believes it no she tell you right she don't know it how could a a lady it's the asking how could a lady as I spoke Sunday last Sunday night a week ago tonight on of red flashing light how that the the the Run of women has become prettier than it ever was now that's nothing nothing against a woman now that's just but how she controls that see that she's got that way to put her in a Temptation like Eve was put before the tree every man every son that comes to God's got to go through that hour of testing this is the age of women this nation is or she has to go through that testing if she can be a pretty woman and act like a sister the Lord's blessings upon her but when she can get her self to to know this and display herself absolutely shows that she's got a a bad Spirit on her she don't mean to be that way I don't think many of them don't but they don't realize that could you tell me that a decent thinking woman could put herself on these little uh clothes that they wear out here on the street I've got two young girls sitting here I don't know what that outcome of them kids will be I just pray for them kids today I don't you can't tell I don't know they're not immune from that they've got to stand on their own two feet before Jesus Christ and give an answer they can't go in on what on on what I believe and what their mother believes I don't know what they do but I actually believe at this hour if them girls went out on the street with them kind of clothes on and a man inell them and I'm kind of clo I don't believe if I had the opportunity I could even condemn the man right I condemn the girls they had no business doing that listen if man thinks that and they teach that man's no more than an animal he come from the animal race and look then and you put him out there like you take the dog to the little female at certain times through the fences and everything else because the little female is in that condition Hogs cows every other animal and if we are animal life which we are the physical part and then when a woman displays herself like that she proves that she's the same thing the little dog is the same thing exactly for she wouldn't be doing that she knows nature teaches her that man's going to look at and the Bible said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed ad doy with her already in his heart that puts a testing time and the devil pretties them women and strips them down and set them out there to give you a test man turn your heads be sons of God women you dress like Daughters of God don't answer for adultery y today if that woman don't matter how innocent she might have never done nothing wrong never even had it in her mind to do wrong but when that sinner who looked upon that graceful Farm of that woman knowing he's a male and female sex and and one glands and one in male in the other and that's s is going to have to answer for it at the day of the Judgment who did it who's guilty not him you amen there you are immoral look at this nation it used to be when they had the knee high dresses that the women War we had to send to Paris to get them today Paris sends here to get them it's got so filthy the parish can't keep up with it that's right the whole why rejecting the gospel why parents didn't have it it's 100% Catholicism the Protestants can't even get in there look at V grah I think these only 600 Christians in all Paris out of the millions 600 Christians Protestants that's not Holy Ghost fill that's just absolutely Protestants 600 amount of millions times millions they didn't get the opportunity to reject it but these people has the gospel and when they get away from the message and the gospel that they've seen demonstrated make fun of it because some old prostitute Doctrine has weaved them around and some Pastor standing in the pull pit thinking more of a dollar and a meal ticket than he does with the soul of people that he's preaching to my God that's what's done it now she leads the world you remember not long ago in this Tabernacle I preached on a subject about years ago I'll show you the goddess of America and had the little flapper here sitting there with that's what it is now they're even get it they're getting what they've asked for and they're going to get it that's all oh they won't believe it no are they let you know they are American citizens and they got a right to to function any way they want to I just wish let me tell you I'll tell you now no sure politics will never work no sure democracy will never work amen democracy's rotten to the Bone amen if it could be run amongst a bunch of Christians it would be fine but when you put it out there in the world it becomes all sales and no anchor am it's exactly right look at here today anything can take place and they'll be just anything pull a few politics and you'll get by with murder when I preached down there that night to try to save them two kids' life they're as guilty as guilty could be even that attorney got up behind me there and he said it's right he said I don't believe in taking the people's life he said if you'll notice on your criminal records who is it it gets killed electric chairs and things it's not the rich he can afford to get him a lawyer and some pull some dirty tricks and some wheel share and some over here and bribe the thing he said it's poor kids like that it ain't got enough money to buy a decent meal that's a kind of guess it there's a kind of electrocute somebody's like they call a bunch of ignorant people and they just hold up their name of capital punishment I said the first murder was ever committed in the world one brother killed another God did not take his life for it he put a mark on him that nobody should take his life right that's a supreme judge now I see they took the sentence off of them now they go to get another trial of course they'll get life now which should be 11 years and maybe stand for parole they're guilty certainly they're guilty they ought to be set to finish poent for Lifetime but not their life take no man has a right to take another man's life no sir I don't believe in it no indeed oh they say well they don't believe that they're out of the will of the Lord because that's all they know about and all they want to hear about they turned to ear against the truth and there neither did Egypt want to know that that bunch of Holy Rollers down there was the will of Lord how they want to know that some crazy man come in there from the Wilderness with Whiskers hanging down like this and said they how come in the name of the Lord turn them children loose Pharaoh would say who me to him out see me if you don't do it the Lord's God's going to Smite this nation the old the old crank turn him out somewhere let him go the sons kind of baked his mind see but it brought judgment Hallelujah because a man was a prophet and had thus sayth the Lord am Hallelujah exactly right they didn't want to believe it Rome didn't want to believe it either but it happened just the same Israel didn't want to believe that that was a messiah how could they bunch a bunch of galileans in aren all all these galileans where did they come from what kind of a crowd does he go with the very poorest that can be got together that's the crowd he Associates with that's who comes to hearing is the poor people that people that don't know nothing they're not elected they're not they're not the intellectual type that we are they're poor Bunch you heard it say about the Revival in this day what kind of crowd hears them what kind of goes to these meetings what kind of people are they I heard a fellow say not long ago well he was kind of a he was hope stepfather and I was telling him about the baptism the Holy Spirit he said now who would believe a thing like that let some kind of a bunch like you got up there he said you let so and so a businessman you're the town a wicked is all go let him say that he received the Holy Ghost then I believe it I said don't worry he'll never say it the man died instantly without God see be careful what you're doing be careful what you're saying you want a life worthy of the Gospel that's right Israel didn't believe it that bunch of people that mad man by the name of Jesus of Nazareth born they thought it ill legitimate birth and the people believed it because they said that wasn't his why his father's Joseph and Mary was to have this baby before he even born why it's illegitimate and what is he just a mad man one of them funny sort of a GU don't go to hear him what did they do they were sending their souls to hell they T Jesus said let them alone if a blind leads a blind don't they both fall in the ditch right they didn't know it they wouldn't believe it they could not they could not see how that a simple people with a simple message to be rejected could cause a great nation to fall to ruins now listen they could not understand that a simple ordinary common bunch of people you know the Bible said that the Common People heard Jesus gladly amen aren't you glad you're labeled common people they heard him gladly amen God is good amen brother Franco yeah you pull up those questions before I get to the first question I just want to um pull out a couple things that he said if we can turn to paragraph 30 which is found on page eight where we began and and um page 8 paragraph 30 says Lord Jesus any man physically or woman or child can move back to pages of this Bible there's no one that can reveal it but you I pray Lord of taking this text as it's placed upon my heart to send out across the Nations for the people that they might know what type of life is required of them to live for so many has asked me is the Christian Life a life of church service is it helping the poor the needy or is it a constant member is it loyal is it loyal loyalty to the church and such questions father May the correct answer come tonight through these words so brother bam is is addressing in his prayer here there's a question about what is a Christian Life is it faithfulness to a church is it doing good deeds and to the poor and needy and really what he's going to get down to to the very core of it that we're going to find as your life worthy of the Gospel Living Christian Life is believing God when God's presented to you there are there are manifestations of that there are things that come with obedience but when when you get down to the core of it it's not faithfulness to a church it's not doing good to the needy or the poor it's receiving the word of God in your day that's really what he's going to that's the heart of what he's trying to tell us is your life worthy of the gospel and I think we'll see that as we move on let's go to paragraph 39 on page 10 uh page 10 paragraph 39 him speaking directly to Israel the ones that was called To The Feast that I would also apply today to men the church who was bidden to come to the feast that won't do it the spiritual Feast of the Lord and they won't do it they don't want to do it they've got other things to do they find excuses so what have we been to we've been to the spiritual Feast of the Lord he's calling us to come and feast on his word let's go now to page 12 paragraph 53 he says look at our religious system today how can it be that the churches can ever get into the condition that they are now so that's the question how is it that the churches can get into the condition they are now he says is because they rejected and refused the message of God the invitation to come to the feast so what is the message of God it's the invitation to come to the feast so how did the churches get into the condition they are now is because they refused the message of God the invitation to the feast they rejected it and he says could you call a life like that worthy of the Gospel what what kind of Life the one who refuses the invitation to the feast is not worthy of the Gospel he's not then he goes on and he talks about going to the Ball Game and seeing the pastor smoking and and the Baptist Church that lets out listen the problem wasn't the smoking that was the indication that the life had left the church and why were they in that condition they refused to accept the invitation of the Lord the message of God and because they refused it somewhere the long lay they find it in a condition brother bram's not saying because you smoke you're not worthy of the Gospel he says no you smoke because you rejected the gospel and rejecting The Gospel made you Unworthy of the Gospel this is just the outcropping of it this is just the effect that it has so but if we go through we're going to go through this entire message but I want you to keep that in your mind brother B is not saying your sinful acts make you Unworthy of the Gospel he's saying rejecting the message of your hour makes you Unworthy of the gospel and then you have no place to go but into this downward spiral Spiral of immorality so it's not doing good versus not doing good that's not what he's talking about it's accepting the word or rejecting the word that's really what he's talking about and then he'll go into some of the effects of that now our first question was why is this nation doomed if you'll go back with me to paragraph 36 on page n we'll start back here and we'll get to the the answer we'll work our way up to it bottom of page N9 paragraph 36 now we see when God gives a man an invitation and to do something or to receive the invitation that he's given him and he he returns it down then there's nothing left after Mercy is spurned but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy then there's only one thing left and that's judgment and we find that the man has done that in all ages it's happened most every age in the Bible so when God gives a man an invitation to turn it down there's nothing left but judgment let's go to paragraph 48 at the bottom of page 11 says America 15 years ago when the great he healing Revival continued on from Pentecost broke out in the nation and there was revivals on the capital Washington DC the presidents vice presidents great people Governors great things taking place governor and men were healed like Congressman Upshaw had been crippled for 66 years and they they could not turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before them but they turned it down and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she is doomed there's no hope for it at all she crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's elected in what she has here to control the nation he's speaking of John F Kennedy being the first Catholic President and she is rotten to the core her politics is rotten the morals of this nation is lower than anything I can think of her religious system is rottener than the morals she becomes in doing this she has now joined herself all these churches of the nation into the Federation of churches and has taken the mark of the beast what a thing why Christ give them the opportunity come to my Feast the Feast of Pentecost which means 50 and so why is this nation doomed they turn down the invitation to the feast that's why this nation is doomed we can say because they've allowed home homosexuality because they've done this no no no that's not why they the nation's in this condition because it rejected the invitation to the feast amen then all of this comes later right so let's go now to paragraph 107 on page 21 brother goes on he talks about Egypt and he talks about Rome and the times that they were destroyed and he says in paragraph 1 7 he says they could not see how that a simple people with a simple message to be rejected could cause a great nation to fall into ruins so why did the nation fall because they rejected the simple message that was among simple people the next question we had was what separates you from god let's go to page 57 on the bottom of page 13 page 57 on the bottom of page 13 to you people who come here I'm not responsible for those or other ministers are speaking to but if it's right you owe your life to it what more could you ever find that would be more of a benefit to you to know that you've got eternal life whatever I was giving away capsules here that scientifically proven scientifically proven that this capsule would make you live a thousand years well I'd have to get a militia out here to swarm them away from the place you wouldn't have to make an altar call for it you just have to beat them away from it to live a thousand years and yet scientifically proven that the Eternal God all his power of His resurrections which promis you eternal life and Satan will put his Legions out there and keep you away from it see yet you can look and sensible enough to look in the face of it and see it's right but then turn it down something kind of an excuse it's too hot I'm too tired I will I will tomorrow just some kind of excuse that's all they do by rejecting the day of visitation is separate you from God listen I I the reason I want to highlight that it's not smoking and drinking and running around and gambling and what separates you from God is rejecting your day of visitation is when God presents himself to you and you turn around and don't want it and reject it that separates you from God everything else comes later amen amen this is going to be this is really important uh let's keep reading now we notice in the Old Testament they had what they called The Jubilee year I thought this was amazing after what brother Gabe preached and here we come along and catch the Jubilee year I was really excited that was when all the people that was slaves would go free when the Jubilee sounded and then if a man did not go out if there was some excuse that he could give that he didn't want to return to his land then he had to be marked in the ear with an owl owl no all sorry and by the post in the temple and then no matter how many jubilees came along that man was sold out he could never no more come back as a citizen in Israel no more what did he do he rejected his invitation he didn't have to pay nothing the debt of his slavery was over his family was free he could go right back to his homeland and get his possession but if he refused to do it then he wasn't LED no more with Israel and his possession was given to another why because he refused the itation to go free that's what this whole thing is about 61 now the same thing in the natural applies to the spiritual that if we as inheritance of eternal life and we hear the gospel and know that it's true and we reject it and refuse to do it or to listen to it we take on the mark of the beast let's go to the next page and go to paragraph 66 but they said we just got enough for ourselves go to them that sell it and while they were trying to receive this oil the bridegroom came there was never been a time in the history of the world that the episcopalians Baptists methodists Presbyterians the papers are full the religious papers are praising God that these sleeping virgins are now trying to receive Pentecost trying to receive the Holy Ghost and don't the people realize that it will not happen according to the word of God while they were trying to come back the bridegroom came and took away the bride and they were cast out in the outer Darkness for judgment because they rejected their invitation so why were they cast out in the outer Darkness for all their sinful Deeds no because they rejected their day of invitation so simple 67 all peoples are bidden to come God in every age has sent out his light and it's been rejected and now today is no different than any other day to reject the day of visitation when God is making a visit to the church and to the people receive it then don't put it off till next year the next Revival that's the hour today is the day of salvation and remember God has never sent a message in any day but what he Vindicated it with the Supernatural Jesus said himself if I do not the works of my father then believe me not but if I do the works you believe the works if you can't believe me and when you see it clearly cut and made manifest now the time has come now the time has come that she rejects it then she's bored in the ear with the all and she'll never hear it she'll never hear it now she takes herself to the confederation of churches and right to the mark of the beast let's go to page 17 paragraph 82 notice bored in the ear marked away then you'll never hear remember that's a sign of closing the ear so being marked in the ear is a sign that your ear now is closed to the gospel because you refuse it you won't hear it no more you won't listen You'll never be able again to do it my oh my so what separates you from God refusing your in your day of invitation that separates you from God next question what kind of life is not worthy let's go to page 16 here at the bottom of 16 paragraph 76 we cannot do that we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the spirit of led by the Lord Jesus Christ if we don't we take an organ organizational life and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy so what life is not worthy the one that doesn't follow Christ daily what did he say before that every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ that's a life that's worthy to not be led by the Lord every day every hour of the day every step of the way is a life that's not worthy amen that's all for the for the questions now I want to I want to go if we can take our Bibles really quick and go to Matthew 22 because this is the other scripture that he referenced was Matthew 22 and he said you can read that too later so I want to read it right now we started off by reading Luke 14 now we're going to read uh Matthew 22 Matthew 22 and let's go to verse one and Jesus answered and spake unto them again to them again by Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for a son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come into the marriage but they made light of it and went their way one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and treated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard the thereof he was wroth and sent forth of his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their City then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which are bidden were not worthy why were they not worthy because they refused the call to come but now look what he says go ye therefore in the highways and as many and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so so these servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests I'm so glad he's not looking just for good but he's calling the bad too and that means I can come to the spiritual Feast of the Lord why because I if I've been bidden to the feast and something in me accepts the invitation then I've been accepted amen and I've now been found worthy of the Gospel not because I was good CU there been both bad and good praise God many rejected it and many who rejected it were good people they weren't bad but they were not worthy to come to the feast because they made excuses not to come but then the call went out to the bad and to the good and I say praise God here's one bad fellow that heard that call and there was something in me that wanted to come to the feast I'm so thankful for that God bless you as we stand musicians if you can come but to John if you can make your way up amen I am so thankful that brother Bram didn't preach the life that's worthy of the Gospel is the one who never makes a mistake and gets everything right and lives all the word perfectly because this message would be super discouraging to me if that's the way he preached it but what he was preaching is a life worthy of the Gospel are you coming To The Feast the supernatural have you been bidden have you heard the call did something in you say I want to come were we willing to drop our merchandise and our farms and our yoke of oen and everything else and come to the call what was that that was God calling you to his Feast I'm so glad he had put something in me to respond to that call I'm not worthy because I'm good I'm not worthy because I've Done Right the only thing that made me Worthy is because God had a seat inside of me that when I heard the invitation I wanted to come and so then I was the one that he was calling to to come into His Feast I'm so thankful for this message and it just gets better and better friends we got two more two more sessions to listen and it just gets better you know you it used to be we thought we had to be perfect we had to live just right and listen there's not a one of us that doesn't want to please the Lord am I don't think there's a one of us that doesn't want to be obedient to our Lord and we want to please him and we want to do things that please him and it breaks our heart when we do things that displease him that's a life of a true child of God that's what we want but it's not those things that make us worthy and it's not the mistakes that make us Unworthy of the Gospel the only thing that would make us Unworthy of the Gospel is if we rejected the invitation to the feast and didn't and made some excuse that we didn't want it but oh friends there's some something in us that wants it we want to come we want to sit at that table we want to Feast on the fatlings and the good things and all the things that he's prepared in this wedding Feast we want to eat it all I want to be there for the whole thing amen praise be to God that's a life worthy of the gospel and you can be good or bad and come to this Feast amen praise the Lord amen let's sing a song brother I feel like singing I wish there was a song written I'm bad but I'm coming to the feast anyhow that would be a good title of a song amen amen I'd love to sing that one right now amen make ready with the [Music] Sanctified the world is not your home he's calling you to be separated for you are his and his alone make yourself ready with the Sanctified life completely set apart this world is not your home he's home calling you to be separated for you are his and his alone we're going to ask brother Ron brother Ron if you'd come down brother John if you'd come we'd like to pray with these brothers brother Gabe if you'd come down and pray with them uh if a couple of the deacons would like to come down brother Dave if you'd like to come and Jeremy if you'd like to come we want to lay hands on these brothers anybody any of the other deacons who are want to come down brother Jim you're welcome to come if you want to make the long journey if not you can stay there and pray but come right down here to the front brother amen let's sing this song again as we get ready just sing that chorus through one more time make yourself ready with the Sanctified life completely set apart this world is not my home he's calling you to be separated for you are his and his alone Amen in the book of Acts when the Holy Ghost separated out two to go on a journey and when they laid hands on them and prayed for them and sent them off and and we believe that they're following the leadership of the Lord to go as they feel led and we want to we want to ask God's blessing upon every step of the journey there's
