[14:57] amen
[14:58] may god bless you while we're standing
[15:00] let's take our bibles if you will and
[15:02] turn with me to genesis chapter one
[15:06] i want to
[15:07] know we have a visitor here my sister
[15:09] karen kiffer's cousin mary dillard's

[15:36] but uh just be praying for that we're
[15:38] looking forward to seeing brother burley
[15:40] again
[15:41] amen genesis chapter 1
[15:44] verse 1.
[15:48] in the beginning
[15:49] god created the heaven and the earth and
[15:52] the earth was without form and void and
[15:55] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[15:57] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[15:59] face
[16:00] of the waters
[16:02] and god said let there be light
[16:04] and there was light amen god bless you
[16:07] as you're seated
[16:09] i mean if you'll keep your bibles handy
[16:10] this morning we've got quite a few
[16:11] scriptures we'd like to look at together
[16:14] i'd like to take the subject this
[16:15] morning life from death
[16:18] and um
[16:19] there's a quote here i'd like to begin
[16:21] reading and then i'll explain the title
[16:23] it says
[16:25] in the message countdown if everything
[16:27] serves god's purpose it's got a
[16:29] resurrection
[16:30] but it can only rise if it serves god's
[16:32] purpose
[16:33] if a flower lives and it's not
[16:35] germatized it will not rise again if you
[16:37] plant corn and is not germatized it will
[16:39] not rise again
[16:40] anything that doesn't serve god's
[16:42] purpose has no resurrection but you
[16:44] can't keep anything in the ground that
[16:46] serves god's purpose
[16:48] it comes forth again to testify of a
[16:50] resurrection we know that all these
[16:53] things are right they are testimonies to
[16:55] us to encourage us
[16:57] so anything that serves god's purpose
[17:00] has got a resurrection coming
[17:02] when we speak of resurrection so many
[17:04] times we we're talking about
[17:06] you know the end time and the
[17:08] resurrection of the sleeping saints but
[17:10] anything that dies and comes back as a
[17:12] resurrection and we find through the
[17:14] bible there's been many many
[17:16] resurrections
[17:17] all the way down through and we'll begin
[17:19] to talk about that a little bit here but
[17:22] nothing's going to ever come back to
[17:24] life unless it serves god's purpose
[17:28] and so many things die and they don't
[17:30] serve god's purpose and they vanish away
[17:32] but there's so many things that
[17:34] seemingly die and like they're finished
[17:36] and if we look here in genesis chapter 1
[17:39] verse 1 it says in the beginning god
[17:41] created the heaven and the earth and we
[17:43] know by the message that there was
[17:44] something took place on earth before we
[17:47] get to genesis 1 2 we find the earth in
[17:50] a form of judgment it's been judged and
[17:53] something went wrong in order for it to
[17:55] be a judgment something that was going
[17:58] contrary to god's purpose something
[18:00] going contrary to god's will or else
[18:02] there would be no judgment god doesn't
[18:04] just judge
[18:05] that makes sense god judges because
[18:07] something was going contrary to his will
[18:10] to his purpose and now when whatever the
[18:13] original creation or even if it was the
[18:15] original we don't know how many times
[18:17] amen the earth may have been destroyed
[18:19] before i have no idea but we know here
[18:21] that we find the earth in a state of
[18:23] judgment because there was some previous
[18:25] civilization or something like that
[18:26] brother branham says in in the fourth
[18:29] seal
[18:30] so whatever it was
[18:32] it ceased to serve god's purpose
[18:35] and now we find the earth void and and
[18:39] darkness over the face of the deep and
[18:41] it's in a form of judgment but god is
[18:43] not done with the earth the earth will
[18:45] still serve god's purpose amen so there
[18:47] must be a resurrection of god's creation
[18:50] he's not going to leave it in this form
[18:53] but it came into this form because he
[18:55] was no longer serving his purpose but
[18:57] because the earth was there to serve
[18:59] god's purpose he's bringing it back
[19:00] again amen and that's what we see in
[19:03] genesis chapter one is him bringing it
[19:05] back again what do we see we see a
[19:07] resurrection of the creation of god
[19:10] is that right
[19:12] and so nothing will have a resurrection
[19:14] unless it serves god's purpose brother
[19:16] benham says when he begins to speak and
[19:18] he said let there be light and then he
[19:19] separated the water and brought out the
[19:21] dry land and he says let the tree bring
[19:23] forth he said those seeds were already
[19:26] in the earth right they were already
[19:28] there and they were there to serve god's
[19:30] purpose and so they resurrected from
[19:33] their dead grave because he has another
[19:35] purpose he's building an eden he's
[19:37] bringing something else out of his mind
[19:39] and so those seeds laying there still
[19:41] had a purpose to serve so they cannot be
[19:44] utterly destroyed
[19:47] praise be to god
[19:49] let's turn to romans chapter 6
[19:52] together
[19:58] like i said there's quite a few
[19:59] scriptures i'd like to read so
[20:01] just be ready to flip
[20:04] romans chapter 6
[20:07] and i'd like to read verse
[20:09] 4.
[20:11] romans 6 and verse 4
[20:13] therefore we are buried with him by
[20:15] baptism into death that like as christ
[20:18] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[20:20] of the father even so we also should
[20:22] walk in newness of life
[20:25] for if we have been planted together in
[20:27] the likeness of his death we shall be
[20:29] also in the likeness of his resurrection
[20:31] knowing this that our old man is
[20:33] crucified with him that the body of sin
[20:36] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[20:37] should not serve sin
[20:39] he that is dead is free from sin now if
[20:42] we be dead with christ we believe that
[20:44] we shall also live with him
[20:47] knowing that christ being raised from
[20:48] the dead dieth no more death hath no
[20:51] more dominion over him for in that he
[20:53] died he died unto sin once but in that
[20:55] he liveth he liveth unto god
[20:58] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[21:01] dead indeed to sin
[21:03] but alive unto god through jesus christ
[21:06] our lord
[21:07] the bible describes us in our state
[21:10] without knowing christ with no knowledge
[21:12] of christ
[21:14] the bible describes us as dead in
[21:16] trespasses and sin
[21:18] we were dead amen we we were like the
[21:20] earth we were shrouded in darkness we
[21:23] our minds were darkened and alienated
[21:25] from god darkened to the things of god
[21:27] we were in a form of judgment and
[21:29] hybridization we were dead in trespasses
[21:32] and sin we were dead to the things of
[21:34] god amen it's like the story of the
[21:36] prodigal son when the prodigal son he
[21:38] leaves the father's house and and he
[21:40] goes off into a strange country and and
[21:43] and he he seemingly forgets who he is or
[21:46] where he came from and he squanders all
[21:48] of his living on riotous living and with
[21:51] harlots and he finds himself in the pig
[21:53] pen amen uh serving now a farmer and
[21:56] serving the pigs until he would have
[21:58] gladly eaten the husks he would have
[22:00] gladly eaten pig food and what a state
[22:03] he had fallen from but it says there
[22:05] that he came to himself
[22:08] he came to himself that wasn't himself
[22:11] that life in the foreign country wasn't
[22:13] himself that wasn't the real hymn that
[22:16] wasn't the reality that's not who he was
[22:18] on the inside that's not who he was uh
[22:20] let's say genetically he's in a foreign
[22:23] land where he doesn't belong amen he's
[22:25] working as a servant which wasn't his
[22:27] job amen he's he's feeding the pigs
[22:29] which wasn't his lot in life amen and
[22:32] now he would so hungry he would eat pigs
[22:34] food which wasn't for him amen it wasn't
[22:36] who he was but at some point he came to
[22:39] himself to come back to what he is amen
[22:44] and when he returns back amen the father
[22:46] receives him gladly amen and and the the
[22:50] older son his older brother amen is
[22:52] angry because the father's showing so
[22:54] much favor and the father says my son
[22:57] who was dead
[23:00] rejoice with me my son who was dead hey
[23:03] listen this is a resurrection from the
[23:05] dead this is a restoration back amen we
[23:08] know the man wasn't dead he was living
[23:10] but to the father he was dead the
[23:12] relationship was broken amen they were
[23:14] dead to one another but when he come to
[23:16] himself there was a resurrection of who
[23:19] he was a resurrection of his purpose a
[23:22] resurrection of his position and he
[23:24] comes back to his position in humility
[23:27] in honor and respect and the father
[23:29] receives him back from the dead amen
[23:34] amen this is our life
[23:38] we come to this earth shrouded in
[23:39] darkness in a state of judgment
[23:42] because of hybridization because of the
[23:44] garden
[23:46] our minds alienated darkened to the
[23:48] things of god shrouded in darkness
[23:52] but god amen is going to bring a word
[23:55] that's going to cause us to come to
[23:57] ourselves and there's going to be a
[23:59] resurrection from the dead amen
[24:03] and and that is uh this is so much has
[24:06] to do with our lives and the cycle of
[24:08] our lives let's turn together to john
[24:11] chapter 11.
[24:23] in john chapter 11 i'm going to begin at
[24:26] verse 1.
[24:30] now a certain man was sick named lazarus
[24:33] of bethany the town of mary and her
[24:35] sister martha
[24:37] it was that mary which anointed the lord
[24:39] with an ointment and wiped his feet with
[24:40] her hair whose brother lazarus was sick
[24:43] therefore his sister sent unto him
[24:46] saying lord behold he whom thou lovest
[24:49] is sick
[24:50] then jesus heard that he said heard when
[24:53] jesus heard that he said
[24:55] this sickness is not unto death
[24:59] before the glory of god
[25:01] that the son of god might be glorified
[25:03] thereby
[25:05] i want to look at this for a minute
[25:07] jesus surely knew that he was going to
[25:10] die
[25:11] he knew
[25:13] the plan because he delayed him going
[25:16] until after lazarus had died but he
[25:18] makes the statement this sickness is not
[25:21] unto death
[25:23] because he has a different idea of death
[25:26] than his disciples do we're going to
[25:27] find that out as we read
[25:29] he's saying this is the purpose of this
[25:31] is not for death
[25:33] it's not it's not as if jesus jesus
[25:35] words could be confused here he says
[25:37] this sickness is not unto death it could
[25:39] almost look like he's making a false
[25:41] prophecy or prosperity prediction
[25:43] because we know that lazarus in the
[25:45] flesh will eventually die in this story
[25:48] amen but jesus is saying it's not for
[25:51] death the purpose of this is not for
[25:53] death there's another purpose in what's
[25:55] happening here
[25:57] this sickness is not unto death but for
[26:00] the glory of god amen do you think
[26:03] lazarus knew why he was so sick his
[26:05] sisters knew why he died and all the
[26:08] trouble that they were facing and the
[26:10] tears that they were shedding and the
[26:11] turmoil that the family in the community
[26:13] was in they had no idea that this
[26:16] sickness was not unto death but for the
[26:17] glory of god
[26:21] that the son of god might be glorified
[26:23] thereby
[26:24] how is it that the son of god is going
[26:26] to be glorified in this story because
[26:28] he's coming to bring a resurrection
[26:30] because resurrection brings glory to the
[26:33] son of god
[26:37] verse five now jesus loved martha and
[26:39] her sister and lazarus
[26:41] when he had heard therefore i love i
[26:43] love
[26:44] verse five
[26:46] god is so good to get our minds in the
[26:49] right frame of mind so that we
[26:52] understand what's happening
[26:54] he says this sickness not to death but
[26:56] for the glory of god
[26:58] that the son of god might be glorified
[27:00] thereby
[27:01] and so that you would know his thoughts
[27:04] towards lazarus and mary and martha he
[27:07] tells you jesus loved martha and her
[27:09] sister and lazarus because he's going to
[27:11] do something that seems unloving so
[27:14] right up front he says he loves them
[27:17] so when he delays the delay in coming is
[27:20] no lack of love
[27:22] so the bible sets it in the right order
[27:25] he already declares this sickness is not
[27:27] unto death but there's a purpose in this
[27:30] and that he loves martha and her sister
[27:32] and lazarus so that you'll never
[27:34] misunderstand the purpose of his delay
[27:38] listen this is us friends
[27:41] the things that you're going through
[27:43] is not for death
[27:45] but for life
[27:47] the things we're going through are not
[27:48] for destruction but for the glory of god
[27:51] the things that are happening and the
[27:52] delay sometimes the lord delays to
[27:55] answer our prayer sometimes the lord
[27:57] delays to bring deliverance but the
[27:59] delay is never a lack of love because
[28:01] he's already stated that he loves us
[28:03] amen that we're accepted in the beloved
[28:05] we're part of the beloved it's not a
[28:07] question of love it's a question of
[28:09] purpose amen it's not a question of love
[28:12] but an issue of purpose
[28:15] this sickness had a purpose from the
[28:18] very beginning the first symptoms that
[28:20] lazarus felt there was already a purpose
[28:23] working in his life amen all the prayers
[28:26] that were seemingly unanswered was
[28:28] because of the purpose of god to display
[28:31] his resurrection power so that the son
[28:33] would be glorified
[28:37] amen
[28:39] so when god seemingly doesn't answer
[28:41] don't lose hope he loves you this is for
[28:44] a purpose
[28:46] this problem is for a purpose this issue
[28:50] is for a purpose amen it's not now
[28:53] listen we've got to grow into a place
[28:55] where we're secure enough in christ till
[28:57] we understand that yes i am accepted in
[29:00] the beloved i have gone into a union
[29:02] with my lord amen now the issue is not
[29:05] love the issue is not favor the issue is
[29:08] not his will
[29:09] whether he loves us or not now the issue
[29:12] completely becomes his purpose in
[29:14] everything that happens in our life so
[29:16] that we stop asking the wrong questions
[29:19] and start asking the right questions
[29:22] the wrong question is why is this
[29:23] happening to me what does not god love
[29:25] me and what have i done wrong and all of
[29:27] these other things those are the wrong
[29:29] questions
[29:31] but the right question is lord let me
[29:33] see your purpose and let me act
[29:35] according to your purpose
[29:40] maturity brings us listen maturity in
[29:43] the bride
[29:44] is is
[29:46] is not the childish notion that when the
[29:49] bride matures nothing else will ever
[29:51] bother her again she'll just speak the
[29:52] word and say this and have this kind of
[29:56] power and manifestation
[29:58] no maturity in the bride might look like
[30:00] maturity and the prophet of god
[30:04] who had all kinds of troubles and
[30:06] tribulations and
[30:08] issues in his life but began to see that
[30:10] god was working a purpose in all of it
[30:13] and begin to trust god in his purpose
[30:21] now verse 5 again now jesus loved martha
[30:23] and her sister in lazarus when he had
[30:25] heard therefore that he was sick he
[30:28] abode two days still in the same place
[30:31] where he was
[30:34] the reason verse 5 is where it's at is
[30:36] because of what he does in verse 6.
[30:40] he heard that he was sick and did
[30:42] nothing
[30:44] heard that he was sick
[30:46] and didn't go immediately
[30:48] delayed two days
[30:53] verse seven then after the then after
[30:55] that saith he to his disciples let us go
[30:57] into judea again
[31:00] his disciples said unto him master the
[31:02] jews of late sought to stone thee and
[31:04] ghost thou thither again jesus answered
[31:08] are there not 12 hours in the day
[31:10] if any man walk in the day he stumbleth
[31:12] not because he seeth the light of the
[31:14] this world but if a man walk in the
[31:16] night he stumbleth because there is no
[31:18] light in him
[31:20] and these things saith he and after that
[31:22] he said unto them
[31:24] our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go
[31:27] that i may awake him out of his sleep
[31:30] then said his disciples lord if he
[31:32] sleepeth he shall do well
[31:34] howbeit jesus spake of his death but
[31:36] they thought that he had spoken of
[31:38] taking of rest and sleep then said jesus
[31:41] unto them plainly lazarus is dead
[31:44] brother branham said he had to come down
[31:46] to their language
[31:48] so they would understand they were not
[31:49] understanding heavenly things they were
[31:51] not understanding spiritual things amen
[31:54] they were stuck in the carnal world with
[31:56] only the dimensions they could see they
[31:58] could not lift high enough to see oh
[32:00] what jesus christ could see and so now
[32:03] he had to speak plainly to them lazarus
[32:05] is dead even though he said he's asleep
[32:09] even though he said the sickness is not
[32:11] unto death
[32:13] because what what jesus means with what
[32:15] he says is not always what they thought
[32:17] he meant with what he said
[32:21] amen he knows what he means and he means
[32:23] what he says and he says it right
[32:26] but sometimes our carnal mind cannot
[32:28] comprehend what he means by what he says
[32:31] but he always says what he means and
[32:33] what he means is always right and he
[32:35] always does it according to the way he
[32:36] said
[32:38] but maybe not according to the way we
[32:39] understood what he said
[32:43] so he sleepeth what do you mean sleepeth
[32:45] if he's sleeping he's doing fine
[32:47] they thought he meant taking rest and
[32:49] they said it's like
[32:50] they have no idea what is happening here
[32:52] and they have no idea what realm that
[32:54] christ is operating at and how far away
[32:57] they are from the realm he's operating
[32:59] at
[33:01] and so he tells him plainly
[33:04] that he's dead
[33:08] verse 15
[33:09] and i am glad for your sakes that i was
[33:12] not there
[33:13] to the intent you may believe
[33:16] nevertheless let us go unto him
[33:20] i'm glad i wasn't there to deliver him
[33:22] from his sickness
[33:25] because
[33:26] he needs to fall asleep
[33:30] so that you can see a resurrection amen
[33:33] because the resurrection will glorify
[33:35] the son of god it will fulfill the
[33:37] purpose of god and it will give you
[33:39] faith to believe
[33:40] you need to see a resurrection
[33:44] not a healing
[33:47] praise god
[33:50] said there
[33:51] there to the intent that you might
[33:52] believe never to let us let us go unto
[33:54] him
[33:55] then sent thomas which is called didymus
[33:57] unto his fellow disciples let us also go
[34:00] that we may die with him
[34:03] i love this statement
[34:05] the bible is so multifaceted and
[34:07] multi-layered no doubt thomas is looking
[34:10] at the situation because they said lord
[34:12] the jews of late have sought to kill you
[34:13] why are you going back into judea he
[34:15] said let us arise go to judea they said
[34:17] the jews of later sought to kill you
[34:19] amen and thomas may have been referring
[34:22] to that and saying you know let us go
[34:24] with him and die with him but there's a
[34:27] spiritual meaning behind it too because
[34:29] thomas has it exactly right amen if you
[34:32] ever want to serve god's purpose you
[34:34] better go with him and die with him amen
[34:36] you better be crucified with christ and
[34:38] die to yourself amen and have a a death
[34:41] experience so that you can have a
[34:42] resurrection experience
[34:45] thomas had it right let us go with him
[34:48] and die with him and i say tonight let
[34:50] us go with him and die with him amen let
[34:52] us die so there can be a resurrection
[34:55] because we need a resurrection
[34:57] experience to prove to manifest the
[34:59] glory of the son of god
[35:03] amen
[35:04] the lord god is glorified
[35:07] in resurrection
[35:10] he has proven
[35:11] in resurrection he's vindicated in
[35:13] resurrection
[35:16] he is all about resurrection
[35:20] let's go to mark chapter 12
[35:24] and look at something jesus says here
[35:27] and in mark chapter 12 jesus is going to
[35:29] set the record straight
[35:33] in
[35:44] in
[35:46] mark chapter 12
[35:48] around about verse 18 we're not going to
[35:50] read from there but the sadducees begin
[35:52] to ask him a question about the
[35:53] resurrection and because they don't
[35:55] understand it they don't believe in it
[35:57] and they start to talk about the woman
[35:59] who was given to a man and they didn't
[36:01] raise up seed but according to the law
[36:03] of moses she should be given to the next
[36:04] younger brother to raise up seed into
[36:06] the dead and so there were seven
[36:08] brothers so they went all the way down
[36:09] the line and and she had them all they
[36:11] all had her and brought no seed and
[36:13] finally the woman died and they said in
[36:15] the resurrection
[36:17] whose wife will she be and jesus begins
[36:19] to say you have no idea what you're
[36:21] talking about
[36:24] you're like you're like an ant trying to
[36:26] explain a human
[36:29] you have no clue what you're even saying
[36:31] but he comes here in verse 26 in order
[36:33] to set the record straight he says verse
[36:36] 26
[36:37] and as touching the dead that they rise
[36:40] have you not read in the book of moses
[36:43] how in the bush god spake on him saying
[36:45] i am the god of abraham and the god of
[36:47] isaac and the god of jacob
[36:50] he is not the god of the dead but the
[36:52] god of the living ye therefore do
[36:55] greatly err
[36:57] listen
[36:58] he is not the god of the dead
[37:03] he's the god of the living
[37:05] when he come to moses in the burning
[37:07] bush
[37:08] abraham in the flesh was dead
[37:12] isaac in the flesh was dead jacob in the
[37:14] flesh was dead they were all known by
[37:17] moses to be dead
[37:19] yes
[37:20] but he says i am currently present tense
[37:24] the god of abraham that means abraham
[37:26] had to be living somewhere he did not
[37:28] say i was the god that abraham served i
[37:31] was the god of isaac i was he said i am
[37:34] right now today the god of abraham who
[37:37] is in existence somewhere
[37:41] because the seed of god does not die
[37:45] that's why you could say lazarus
[37:47] although lazarus was dead he admitted he
[37:49] was dead and in the carnal understanding
[37:51] he's dead and the heavenly understanding
[37:53] he sleepeth because lazarus can't die
[37:58] amen
[37:59] so he says you don't understand amen
[38:02] he's
[38:03] he's not the god of the dead but he's
[38:05] god of the living you therefore do
[38:07] greatly air
[38:09] it only looked like he was dead
[38:13] it only seemed like he was dead
[38:16] but to god he was alive
[38:20] that's why when we experience death with
[38:22] loved ones and death with family members
[38:24] it's so different for a believer than it
[38:26] is for the rest of the world
[38:28] it's not even the same experience
[38:30] there's grief sure and tears and a
[38:32] feeling of loss and all of that but
[38:34] there's such a revelation in this hour
[38:36] and such an understanding amen that if
[38:38] that was a part of god and come from god
[38:41] it's went back to god it can no more die
[38:43] amen it cannot be dead it has to be
[38:46] alive that that brother that sister has
[38:49] to remain alive somewhere because he's
[38:51] not the god of the dead he's the god of
[38:53] the living
[38:56] amen
[38:59] let's turn to mark chapter 5.
[39:14] mark chapter 5
[39:16] and we'll read verse 35.
[39:21] and why yet spake there came from the
[39:23] ruler of the synagogue's house certain
[39:25] which said thy daughter is dead why
[39:28] troublest thou the master any further
[39:30] and as soon as jesus heard the word that
[39:32] was spoken he saith unto the ruler of
[39:33] the synagogue be not afraid only believe
[39:36] and he suffered no man to follow him
[39:38] save peter and james and john the
[39:40] brother of james and he cometh to the
[39:42] house of the ruler of the synagogue and
[39:44] seeth the tumult and them that wept and
[39:47] wailed greatly and when he was come in
[39:49] he saith unto them why make you this ado
[39:51] and weep the damsel is not dead but
[39:54] sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn
[39:58] but when he had put them all out he
[40:00] taketh the father and the mother of the
[40:02] dams on them that were with them and
[40:04] entereth in where the damsel was lying
[40:07] and he took the damsel by the hand and
[40:09] said unto her
[40:10] talitha kumi which is being interpreted
[40:13] damso i say unto thee arise
[40:15] and straightway the damsel arose and
[40:18] walked for she was of the age of 12
[40:19] years and they were astonished with
[40:21] great astonishment and he charged them
[40:23] straightly with that no man should know
[40:25] it and commanded them something should
[40:27] be given her to eat
[40:29] here comes jesus and they they
[40:32] they have a sick girl jairus has a sick
[40:35] girl and begs him to come and pray for
[40:38] her lay hands on her but along the way
[40:40] they found out she's dead but jesus is
[40:43] not one drop troubled at this statement
[40:47] because when he gets there he says what
[40:49] is what is all this fussing what is all
[40:51] this to do
[40:53] the dams will sleepeth
[40:55] and they laughed him to scorn amen but
[40:57] he he had already tried to teach him the
[41:00] principle amen that children of god
[41:03] don't die
[41:06] they don't die
[41:07] it looked like she was dead but she
[41:10] wasn't dead amen she was alive somewhere
[41:14] and when she when he reached and called
[41:16] her name and reached her hand and lifted
[41:18] her up and called her name he told her
[41:20] to arise and at the voice of the lord
[41:22] she arose and began moving began walking
[41:25] again it only looked like she was dead
[41:28] but she wasn't dead amen in the terms of
[41:31] medical science she was dead maybe the
[41:33] doctor already checked the pulse maybe
[41:35] they already determined that she was
[41:36] dead amen but but god is not looking at
[41:39] what medical science is looking at he
[41:41] knows the reality of the reality of the
[41:44] reality that that girl was not dead she
[41:46] was just sleeping and that christ could
[41:48] call her back anytime
[41:51] listen
[41:52] if
[41:53] brother baby said if you ever have you
[41:55] ever have eternal life you always had
[41:58] eternal life
[42:02] he said that seed gene of god that was
[42:04] within you is a part of god amen and it
[42:06] was there from your birth it was in you
[42:09] when you were born amen and it was it
[42:11] was there laying dormant it was as if it
[42:14] was dead you were dead in sins and
[42:16] trespasses just as dead as the prodigal
[42:18] son was dead not dead but seemingly dead
[42:22] separated from god living the wrong kind
[42:25] of life amen in that sea gene in you if
[42:27] it's got etern if you have eternal life
[42:30] you always had eternal life
[42:33] amen
[42:35] so so it looked like that it was dead
[42:39] but god knew that it was only sleeping
[42:43] it looked like the real you the the seed
[42:46] that was meant to be you it looked like
[42:48] it was dead but it was only sleeping
[42:50] amen it looked like the earth was
[42:52] completely dead but god knew the seeds
[42:55] were laying down there ready to come
[42:56] forth all he had to do was order the
[42:59] condition and the condition would bring
[43:01] the the regeneration and the birth amen
[43:03] and they would come to life they were
[43:05] laying their dormant those seeds under
[43:07] the earth in genesis 1 2 were sleeping
[43:13] amen and there's so many people that are
[43:16] still sleeping and they look like
[43:18] they're dead so many loved ones that
[43:20] have strayed away family members amen
[43:22] not believing children that we're
[43:24] holding out for it looks like they're
[43:26] dead they're not dead amen if they're
[43:28] children of god they're only sleeping
[43:30] that seed's laying dormant amen waiting
[43:33] for the voice of the lord to come to
[43:35] them to call them to rise up and as soon
[43:37] as the lord comes to them personally and
[43:40] bids them to rise they will rise amen
[43:42] they will awaken
[43:47] because his power is manifest in
[43:49] resurrection
[43:51] his power is manifest in resurrection
[43:55] amen let's go to colossians chapter 2.
[44:12] colossians chapter 2.
[44:23] and verse 9
[44:27] colossians 2 9 for in him dwelleth all
[44:29] the fullness
[44:30] of the godhead bodily and ye are
[44:33] complete in him which is the head of all
[44:35] principalities
[44:36] and power
[44:38] in him in whom also you are circumcised
[44:41] with the circumcision made without hands
[44:43] and putting off the body of the sins of
[44:46] the flesh by the circumcision of christ
[44:48] buried with him in baptism wherein also
[44:51] you are risen with him through the faith
[44:53] of the operation of god who hath raised
[44:55] him from the dead
[44:57] and you being dead in your sins in the
[44:59] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[45:01] quickened together with him having
[45:03] forgiven you all trespasses
[45:07] you were dead in sins
[45:09] it was as you were as if you were dead
[45:12] but he has quickened you with him
[45:15] you you were buried with him in baptism
[45:17] so that you could raise resurrect again
[45:19] with him in newness of life you have
[45:22] died so that you could be resurrected
[45:24] because
[45:25] this
[45:27] oh my goodness
[45:29] this sickness is not unto death
[45:33] but for the glory of god
[45:35] this condition you're born into is not
[45:37] for death but it's for the glory of god
[45:39] amen the seemingly death that the bad
[45:41] things that happen in life even the
[45:43] wanderings away and straying away and
[45:45] living in the world that sickness is not
[45:48] unto death but it's for the glory of god
[45:50] so that the son of god can be manifest
[45:53] can be glorified in your life
[45:56] in the message christ is the mystery of
[45:58] god revealed he says oh if i could get
[46:00] the world to see that
[46:02] why there you are there is the body of
[46:04] christ living standing redeemed redeemed
[46:06] oh my justified in his sight why are we
[46:09] justified we are his victory the church
[46:13] is his victory we came forth in the last
[46:15] days with this glorious gospel showing
[46:17] his victory he died for this purpose and
[46:21] we are proof of his victory amen when we
[46:24] see him coming down and living among the
[46:26] church that's his victory shows that he
[46:28] couldn't keep him in the grave neither
[46:30] can they keep us that's right and we're
[46:32] already potentially arise because we've
[46:35] raised from the dead unbelief in his
[46:37] word from denominational creeds to an
[46:40] eternal word of the eternal god which is
[46:43] him his self working through us
[46:46] manifesting himself that he is the same
[46:48] yesterday today and forever
[46:51] what is the what is his victory and the
[46:53] reason of his death resurrection amen
[46:55] what resurrection the restoration of the
[46:57] bride tree is a resurrection amen
[47:00] it looked like in the dark ages it was
[47:02] dead
[47:03] it looked like it was completely dead it
[47:06] had fallen the the those insects had
[47:08] eaten it down to where it was just a
[47:10] stump it looked on the surface dead it
[47:13] looked like the church had died it
[47:14] looked like what started at pentecost
[47:16] was completely dead amen but brother
[47:18] bannon said there was still life down in
[47:21] the roots amen there was still something
[47:23] there amen and god was going to bring a
[47:25] resurrection and so he started in the
[47:28] reformation to resurrect to res restore
[47:30] the bride tree
[47:33] and we're living here in the final stage
[47:35] of the resurrection when the
[47:37] resurrection power will be made manifest
[47:39] in the bride
[47:42] what are we here for
[47:44] resurrection
[47:46] even in even under the
[47:49] the the catholic church the death that
[47:51] had set in amen to the to the church
[47:54] through the first four church ages
[47:56] coming all the way to the dark ages amen
[47:58] it looked like it was dead on the
[48:00] surface it was dead there was no sign of
[48:02] life amen but that sickness was not unto
[48:05] death but for the glory of god because
[48:07] he said i will restore saith the lord
[48:10] amen there was a prophecy already laying
[48:12] down that i will restore so death is not
[48:15] the finish line amen death amen is just
[48:18] a purpose that god has to bring his
[48:20] glory into full view
[48:25] amen
[48:28] further down in christ is the mystery of
[48:29] god revealed he says notice the
[48:31] vindicated word in his body is his very
[48:34] victory in the reason of his death
[48:37] see the death not in the spirit when he
[48:39] died he only died in the flesh his
[48:41] spirit went to hell and preached to the
[48:42] souls in prison that right his flesh
[48:45] only died when he raised it up again and
[48:47] quickened it quicken means made alive
[48:49] his flesh which was his body
[48:52] and that's the word it's been laying
[48:54] dead for years
[48:56] but gradually begin to come in the
[48:58] reformation and now she is standing upon
[49:01] her feet
[49:03] brother branham begins to show that the
[49:05] the word the word was was as if it was
[49:08] dead amen it was as if there was no life
[49:12] it was as if it was dead and he says
[49:14] this is what he said and that's the word
[49:16] it's been laying dead for years
[49:19] but gradually coming back in the
[49:21] reformation and now she's standing on
[49:23] her feet and then the next thing he says
[49:25] is oh i wish i had time to go into
[49:28] ezekiel and hit those dry bones because
[49:30] when you get to ezekiel and the dry
[49:31] bones amen there's a restoration of the
[49:33] army of god it's laying out there dead
[49:37] dead bones it's just dry bone it's a
[49:40] valley of dust and a valley of bones
[49:43] amen but under the prophecy amen the
[49:46] word goes forth and when the word goes
[49:47] forth it starts to move bone to bone
[49:50] amen and then it covers in sin you then
[49:52] it covers it in skin and then it's
[49:54] standing there after three stages it
[49:56] comes back bone to bone sinew and flesh
[49:59] and now it's standing there an army
[50:01] ready for full life amen but there's got
[50:04] to be a call for the wind to come
[50:05] there's got to be the latter rain
[50:07] there's got to be a sweeping of the holy
[50:09] ghost at the opening of the word to come
[50:11] in to give life into this army it looked
[50:14] like it was dead but god knew it wasn't
[50:16] dead all it needed was the word to be
[50:18] spoken over it and that army started
[50:20] coming back together under what the
[50:22] power of the word put it back to life
[50:25] amen but there had to be a final stage a
[50:28] fourth stage amen there had to be a
[50:30] latter reign there had to be an open
[50:32] book amen
[50:34] there had to be a sounding of the seven
[50:36] thunders to do what sweep the life the
[50:39] breath amen the wind to come back into
[50:42] that church and now she's resurrected
[50:44] she's alive she's standing on her feet
[50:46] and she's marching to zion
[50:50] amen
[50:51] even that was not unto death
[50:54] but for the glory of god
[50:56] it served a purpose
[51:00] praise god
[51:02] i'm laying this down
[51:04] because we want to bring this home to
[51:06] our lives
[51:08] death is never what it seems
[51:12] and i'm gonna i'm not even talking about
[51:15] natural death
[51:17] and this body of flesh breathing oxygen
[51:19] in and out
[51:21] i'm talking about there's all kinds of
[51:22] death
[51:23] there's death to dreams there's death to
[51:25] ideas there's death to doctrines
[51:27] there's death to churches
[51:30] death to movements death but death is
[51:32] never what it seems
[51:35] because if it serves god's purpose it'll
[51:37] resurrect again
[51:40] let's look at galatians
[51:42] chapter 2.
[51:50] galatians chapter 2
[51:54] and verse 20
[51:57] galatians 2 and 20
[51:59] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[52:01] i live yet not i but christ liveth in me
[52:04] and the life which i now live in the
[52:06] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[52:08] god who loved me and gave himself for me
[52:12] i'm crucified with christ
[52:14] but i live
[52:16] but now it's not me it's christ that
[52:19] liveth in me
[52:20] now
[52:21] i i've gone through death
[52:24] to a resurrection
[52:26] i've been crucified to be brought up in
[52:28] his life amen not amen for the glory of
[52:32] god so that his purpose could be made
[52:35] manifest
[52:36] in me that's why we've gone through this
[52:38] cycle let's
[52:40] go back a page to galatians chapter 1
[52:42] verse 11.
[52:46] galatians chapter 1 verse 11
[52:49] but i certify you brethren
[52:52] that the gospel which was preached to me
[52:54] is not after man
[52:55] for i neither received it of man neither
[52:57] was i taught it but by the revelation of
[52:59] jesus christ for you have heard of my
[53:02] conversion in time past in the jewish
[53:03] religion how that beyond measure i
[53:05] persecuted the church of god and wasted
[53:07] him and profited in the jews religion
[53:09] above many mine equals in my own nation
[53:12] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[53:14] traditions of my fathers but when it
[53:16] pleased god who separated from me from
[53:18] my mother's womb and called me by his
[53:20] grace to reveal his son and me that i
[53:23] might preach him among the heathen
[53:25] immediately i conferred not with flesh
[53:27] and blood neither went i up to jerusalem
[53:29] to them which are apostles before me but
[53:31] i went into arabia and returned again
[53:34] unto damascus
[53:36] we know that the apostle paul was
[53:38] zealous
[53:40] he was zealous for he thought he was
[53:42] zealous for the lord
[53:44] but he realized later he said he was
[53:46] zealous for the tradition of the fathers
[53:49] and he he was confused between the
[53:51] traditions of the fathers and the will
[53:53] of god
[53:55] and he was zealous for the traditions of
[53:57] the fathers
[53:58] amen but didn't realize he thought he
[54:00] was zealous for the lord but really he
[54:02] was just zealous for the traditions of
[54:03] the fathers
[54:05] but god stopped him on his way to
[54:07] damascus to persecute the christians and
[54:10] and there he got a revelation of who
[54:12] christ was and where he was abiding
[54:15] because he found out that christ was in
[54:17] the people that paul was persecuting
[54:21] and
[54:21] and all of a sudden paul
[54:24] he doesn't go confer with man
[54:27] and realize this is a major statement
[54:29] for paul
[54:30] he never conferred with flesh and blood
[54:32] because all that paul had before he got
[54:35] from gamaliel
[54:36] he had went to the best school and
[54:38] conferred with man to get the best
[54:40] teaching so now when paul makes this
[54:42] statement it's a huge statement for the
[54:44] apostle paul it's not like paul was just
[54:47] an ignorant fisherman and all of a
[54:49] sudden the lord came to me said i didn't
[54:50] confer with man well we didn't expect
[54:52] you to i mean
[54:55] but paul had been conferring with man
[54:57] all along he got his doctrine right he
[54:59] had been taught in the best school by
[55:01] the best doctor of divinity amen but now
[55:04] in this encounter he's got to die to
[55:07] that he's got the apostle paul has to go
[55:10] through a death he's got to die to
[55:12] everything he was and everything he
[55:14] thought and everything he wanted and all
[55:16] ambitions that he had he's got to let it
[55:18] die he's got to let it rot and now he
[55:21] can't confer with any man because he
[55:23] made that mistake before now he's got to
[55:25] get it straight from the lord
[55:28] let's look at this over in philippians
[55:32] philippians chapter 3
[55:40] philippians chapter 3
[55:43] verse
[55:46] 4. he says
[55:49] though i might also have confidence in
[55:51] the flesh
[55:52] if any of me if any other man thinketh
[55:55] that he have aware of he might trust in
[55:57] the flesh i'm more
[55:59] circumcised the eighth day of the stock
[56:01] of israel of the tribe of benjamin a
[56:04] hebrew of the hebrews as touching the
[56:06] law of pharisee
[56:08] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[56:11] touching the righteous righteousness
[56:13] which is in the law blameless but what
[56:16] things were gained to me those i counted
[56:18] lost for christ yea doubtless and i
[56:20] count all things but lost for the
[56:23] excellency of the knowledge of christ
[56:25] jesus my lord for whom i have suffered
[56:27] the loss of all things and do count them
[56:30] but done that i may win christ
[56:33] and be found in him
[56:34] not having mine own righteousness which
[56:36] is of the law but that which is through
[56:38] the faith of christ the righteousness
[56:41] which is of god by faith
[56:43] that i may know him in the power of his
[56:45] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[56:47] sufferings being made conformable unto
[56:50] his death
[56:51] if by any means i might attain unto the
[56:53] resurrection of the dead not as though i
[56:56] had already attained either were already
[56:58] perfect but i follow after if that i may
[57:00] apprehend that for which also i am
[57:03] apprehended of christ jesus
[57:05] brethren i count not myself to have
[57:07] apprehended but this one thing i do
[57:09] forgetting those things which are behind
[57:10] and reaching forth unto those things
[57:12] which are before i press toward the mark
[57:14] for the prize of the high calling of god
[57:17] in christ jesus let us therefore as many
[57:19] as be perfect be thus minded
[57:22] he's saying if you're already perfect if
[57:24] you're already mature have this same
[57:26] mind
[57:28] that don't believe i've already arrived
[57:30] but i'm striving for i'm pressing
[57:32] towards to great a hold of what's
[57:33] already got a hold of me
[57:38] thus minded if any if anything you be
[57:40] otherwise minded god shall reveal even
[57:43] this unto you
[57:44] nevertheless where to we have already
[57:46] attained
[57:48] where do we have already attained let us
[57:50] walk by the same rule let us mine the
[57:53] same thing
[57:54] the apostle paul was saying
[57:57] i
[57:58] i had all the credentials
[58:00] i was circumcised on the eighth day of
[58:02] the stock of benjamin a pharisee of the
[58:04] pharisees i i i was zealous unto good
[58:08] works i had it all
[58:10] but i had to die to all of that
[58:14] to grab ahold of christ
[58:17] and i had to reckon he says reckon
[58:19] yourselves now for dead to sin wrecking
[58:22] yourselves down dead to all of those
[58:23] things to the world to unbelief to man's
[58:26] ideas wrecking yourself dead to all of
[58:28] that that i might attain to christ that
[58:31] i might attain to the resurrection that
[58:34] i might amen be a partaker of his
[58:36] resurrection that i might know him and
[58:39] the power of his resurrection
[58:41] paul had to have a resurrection
[58:44] his idea had to die amen and paul was
[58:48] was zealous because there was a certain
[58:50] nature inside paul
[58:53] there was a certain attribute of god
[58:55] inside paul there was a certain nature
[58:57] laying there amen but but the carnal
[59:00] part of paul would take that and run to
[59:02] the school and run to the traditions of
[59:04] the fathers amen but when it came time
[59:07] for god to awaken him he had to die to
[59:10] all of that and he had to let it all go
[59:12] away and let it all die amen because god
[59:15] was going to take and revive resurrect
[59:18] bring back paul amen and the apostle he
[59:21] was saul but now he's going to come back
[59:23] as paul amen and paul is going to be
[59:26] zealous and to good works
[59:28] paul is going to be circumcised
[59:33] not on the eighth day
[59:34] but circumcised without hands by the
[59:37] circumcision of christ
[59:40] paul is going to find out it's not so
[59:42] much i'm a benjamin but i'm of god i'm a
[59:45] child of god i'm a stock of god amen i'm
[59:48] circumcised by the holy ghost
[59:50] he's going to have to drop all of that
[59:52] to get the real amen he's going to have
[59:54] to die to everything that was carnal to
[59:56] get a hold of the spiritual
[1:00:00] and so he begins the
[1:00:02] the lay it all down and say i count it
[1:00:04] as dung
[1:00:07] that i may win christ
[1:00:09] and then i might know him in the power
[1:00:11] of his resurrection
[1:00:15] i say death is a good thing
[1:00:20] because it's not the end of the story
[1:00:23] for the believer it's the beginning
[1:00:26] because this death
[1:00:29] this that paul was going through
[1:00:32] was not for his extermination
[1:00:34] but for his perfection
[1:00:37] this dying out to his thinking dying out
[1:00:40] to his education dying out to the
[1:00:42] traditions of the fathers dying out to
[1:00:45] his birth heritage dying out to all that
[1:00:47] he had been working for all of his life
[1:00:49] amen it wasn't for death but it was for
[1:00:52] the glory of god
[1:00:54] he had to die out to it all so that he
[1:00:56] could be resurrected amen so instead of
[1:00:58] serving his own purpose he could serve
[1:01:00] god's purpose
[1:01:03] the apostle paul amen he thought that he
[1:01:06] was zealous for the word but he was
[1:01:09] zealous for the traditions of the
[1:01:11] fathers so paul was saul was operating
[1:01:14] in his own purpose
[1:01:17] he had his own desire his own purpose
[1:01:18] something he wanted to accomplish he was
[1:01:21] in with the high priest and the elders
[1:01:23] and and and he was climbing the ladder
[1:01:25] if you could say it that way he had been
[1:01:27] to the best school he was recognized by
[1:01:29] the chief priests the elders and the
[1:01:30] high priests they knew him even when he
[1:01:32] come to his trial and he begins to speak
[1:01:34] amen there at the temple he says your
[1:01:37] your elders and the priest they know me
[1:01:40] i was in i was in good company with them
[1:01:43] i was climbing as it were the the ladder
[1:01:46] i was i was becoming something amen and
[1:01:49] he had to lose every bit of it to become
[1:01:52] something
[1:01:53] because the path he was on was the path
[1:01:55] to nowhere amen it was death but in
[1:01:57] order to have life he had to die so
[1:02:00] there could be a resurrection of the
[1:02:01] purpose of god that was in paul's life
[1:02:03] not paul's purpose
[1:02:06] amen
[1:02:09] in the message the world is falling
[1:02:10] apart
[1:02:12] it says we are dead our lives are hidden
[1:02:14] in god through christ and not only that
[1:02:16] but we are raised with him
[1:02:19] raised up what in a system a
[1:02:21] denomination organization
[1:02:23] we are resurrected in the kingdom of god
[1:02:25] the kingdom of god is within you why
[1:02:28] all these man-made systems must fall
[1:02:32] not once more i'll shake the world but
[1:02:34] i'll shake heavens and those things that
[1:02:36] cannot be shook is what will remain and
[1:02:38] we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom
[1:02:41] that cannot be shook or moved that's the
[1:02:44] kingdom of god not a system
[1:02:46] not a political wheel not a denomination
[1:02:49] but a kingdom amen and its subjects is
[1:02:52] dead to the systems of the world
[1:02:55] its subjects are dead to these
[1:02:57] organizations it's dead to these
[1:02:59] political systems and it's alive and
[1:03:01] resurrected by the power of the king
[1:03:04] let's look at galatians chapter 6.
[1:03:08] just jump back real quick to galatians
[1:03:10] chapter 6
[1:03:11] verse 14.
[1:03:18] galatians 6 14 but god forbid that i
[1:03:20] should glory saving the cross of our
[1:03:22] lord jesus christ by whom the world is
[1:03:25] crucified to me and i unto the world
[1:03:30] there was a separation amen he's
[1:03:32] recognized himself in calvary as dead to
[1:03:35] the world and the world dead to him he
[1:03:37] died to his old life to have his new
[1:03:39] life and brother bam says the subjects
[1:03:41] are dead to organizations
[1:03:45] dead to political systems
[1:03:47] dead to the systems of the world
[1:03:50] and you know we have to make sure that
[1:03:52] we remain dead
[1:03:54] dead to organizational systems but we've
[1:03:56] got to make sure that no organizational
[1:03:58] thinking comes into this new life that
[1:04:00] it's got to die
[1:04:02] it's got to die it's got a rod amen
[1:04:04] nothing from the from the previous
[1:04:06] organizations can be carried in to this
[1:04:09] new life it's got to
[1:04:10] die paul was so thoroughly dead and and
[1:04:15] so thoroughly resurrected that the
[1:04:17] apostle paul amen he would stand and
[1:04:20] contest with the judaizers the jews who
[1:04:23] were trying to mingle the law and grace
[1:04:25] together amen and before he was all law
[1:04:29] all circumcision all feast days all i
[1:04:32] mean everything la la la la la but he
[1:04:34] had so died to that amen and been born
[1:04:38] again that now he was serving god's
[1:04:40] purpose and he was preaching the message
[1:04:42] of grace and now when the jews come
[1:04:44] along who hadn't died to the system the
[1:04:47] apostle paul was standing there saying
[1:04:49] not the circumcision made with hands
[1:04:51] that's not the one that counts it's not
[1:04:53] mount sinai that can be touched with
[1:04:55] with hands it's not this it's not that
[1:04:57] but he's brought him into a spiritual
[1:04:59] reality a spiritual kingdom a position
[1:05:02] in christ
[1:05:04] paul didn't bring anything
[1:05:06] over paul didn't adapt any of that old
[1:05:10] into the new he let it all die and he
[1:05:13] took it all for what it was now he found
[1:05:16] it all in christ and christ was the
[1:05:18] fulfillment of it all
[1:05:20] praise be to god and neither can we
[1:05:23] bring any other baptist thinking or our
[1:05:26] wesleyan thinking or pentecostal
[1:05:28] thinking it's all gonna die amen because
[1:05:31] the prophet of god come along and he
[1:05:32] illuminated this word and brought the
[1:05:34] word back to life it was laying as if it
[1:05:37] was dead but it was brought back to life
[1:05:39] it was resurrected what paul had taught
[1:05:42] had died through the church ages but it
[1:05:43] was resurrected in our day and now we
[1:05:46] can see it for the intent that he had
[1:05:48] when he spoke it amen
[1:05:50] not what man has done with it but the
[1:05:52] intent that it was spoken with the
[1:05:54] intent that the word was laid down with
[1:05:56] the intention that the gospel was
[1:05:58] written out and now we have that and in
[1:06:01] order to fully grasp amen what the
[1:06:03] message is teaching us we have to
[1:06:05] absolutely die and separate from any
[1:06:08] previous thinking at all
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:14] the apostle paul was able to
[1:06:17] encountered all this dumb
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:22] i i've said before
[1:06:23] i'm thankful that i was raised in church
[1:06:27] i'm thankful that i i learned
[1:06:30] where the bible was where the books of
[1:06:31] the bible were i'm thankful i learned
[1:06:33] how to read it i'm thankful that i
[1:06:35] learned all the bible stories because
[1:06:36] when i come to the message i knew the
[1:06:38] story of moses i i already knew the
[1:06:40] story of noah i could already see what
[1:06:42] the prophet of god was teaching
[1:06:44] so there's a portion of that i'm
[1:06:46] thankful for
[1:06:47] but there's a portion of that that's
[1:06:49] been a handicap to me
[1:06:51] there's a portion of that upbringing as
[1:06:53] a child and and the memorizing bible
[1:06:56] verses with the wrong understanding of
[1:06:57] the bible verse
[1:07:00] with the with the teaching of the of the
[1:07:02] what was supposed to be types and
[1:07:04] shadows and being taught in a certain
[1:07:06] way that it begins to diminish the true
[1:07:07] type and shadow that the prophet would
[1:07:09] bring
[1:07:10] with understanding what paul wrote and
[1:07:13] the commandments that he gave to the
[1:07:14] church to be a certain way but the
[1:07:16] prophet comes in and teaches it some way
[1:07:18] completely different as some of that has
[1:07:20] been detrimental to me
[1:07:23] and we've had to die out to those things
[1:07:25] over time and say it's not the way i
[1:07:28] thought it was when i was a kid i don't
[1:07:30] read the bible the same way i did when i
[1:07:32] was a child growing up in the
[1:07:33] pentecostal church i don't read the
[1:07:35] bible the same way i did five years ago
[1:07:38] because the message amen is brought
[1:07:41] resurrected the life of the word brought
[1:07:43] back the true meaning the revelation of
[1:07:45] the word and everything that i thought
[1:07:47] before and i had been taught before in
[1:07:50] my school of gamaliel in the pentecostal
[1:07:52] church it's all got to go it's all got
[1:07:54] to be considered dung amen it doesn't
[1:07:56] mean anything now the only thing that's
[1:07:58] reality is this revelation through this
[1:08:00] messenger in the end time
[1:08:03] it is the correct understanding of the
[1:08:05] word it is the correct interpretation of
[1:08:07] the word
[1:08:10] amen
[1:08:13] in the in message be not afraid is his
[1:08:15] eye the prophet says look what he chose
[1:08:18] fisherman illiterate ignorant that he
[1:08:20] might manifest himself
[1:08:22] you might say to me about paul paul said
[1:08:24] he had to forget everything he ever know
[1:08:26] to know christ
[1:08:27] died daily that he might know christ
[1:08:31] i said before i would love
[1:08:33] i would love
[1:08:35] to have a button
[1:08:37] in my brain
[1:08:38] that would be complete delete
[1:08:44] and i wish that i had a usb drive or an
[1:08:46] sd card that i could slip in somewhere
[1:08:49] and it would be 1200 sermons in the full
[1:08:51] bible text and maybe a bible dictionary
[1:08:56] and maybe i don't even need the bible
[1:08:57] dictionary
[1:09:00] because you realize so often that you
[1:09:03] look at the message and you're reading
[1:09:04] your bible and all of a sudden the
[1:09:06] revelation's hit and it strikes and
[1:09:07] something opens up and you say i never
[1:09:09] saw it that way before and the reason
[1:09:11] you didn't see it that way before is
[1:09:13] because of previous understanding
[1:09:16] and god had to break that away so you
[1:09:18] could see the word as it actually is
[1:09:22] and so i would love i would love to have
[1:09:25] the delete button i hope that's what we
[1:09:27] get when we leave this body and go into
[1:09:29] the next that there is a a partial
[1:09:31] delete like everything that was not
[1:09:34] god's original intent in the word goes
[1:09:35] away and everything i picked up that was
[1:09:37] true stays
[1:09:39] and then gets magnified
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:44] i want so bad to forget
[1:09:47] the things that i learned wrong
[1:09:50] and count them as done
[1:09:52] not discounting the fact that i thank
[1:09:54] god that he held me in morality
[1:09:56] because of my upbringing i thank god
[1:09:58] that that that i knew the bible said i
[1:10:00] thank god for all of that i'm not
[1:10:02] discounting any of that but oh i picked
[1:10:04] up so many things that were wrong i
[1:10:05] picked up so many wrong ideas and you
[1:10:07] could be in the same spot having grown
[1:10:09] up in the message it doesn't mean you're
[1:10:11] free from that because we we had all
[1:10:13] kinds of ideas that mingled in and
[1:10:15] brought in and just because you're
[1:10:16] raising the message didn't mean you got
[1:10:18] the correct understanding first time
[1:10:19] around
[1:10:21] there's still a lot of dying to do even
[1:10:23] being raised in the message and
[1:10:24] sometimes the dying is harder because
[1:10:26] you thought it was right the first time
[1:10:28] around
[1:10:31] like for those of us who've come from
[1:10:32] outside the end it's like yeah that was
[1:10:34] nothing this is it lord let me die to it
[1:10:37] all but if you have to transition from
[1:10:39] the wrong understanding of the message
[1:10:41] to the right understanding the message
[1:10:42] having grown up in the message you
[1:10:44] really got some dying to do and you
[1:10:46] really need the lord to come with the
[1:10:48] sword that can divide amen to down to
[1:10:51] the bone and the moral of the bones so
[1:10:53] that you can really get down to what is
[1:10:55] truth and cut away everything that was
[1:10:57] man's idea
[1:11:00] and say god help us with that help keep
[1:11:03] cutting us and shaving us and cutting
[1:11:05] off everything that's not right and keep
[1:11:07] us in the true in the right
[1:11:10] amen let's let's turn to exodus chapter
[1:11:12] 2 together and i want to look a little
[1:11:14] bit at the life of moses
[1:11:19] i'm not just wanting to look at one
[1:11:21] aspect of death and resurrection of life
[1:11:24] from death
[1:11:25] but i want to look at a couple different
[1:11:28] aspects or
[1:11:30] applications
[1:11:32] exodus chapter 2
[1:11:37] and verse 11.
[1:11:43] exodus 2 and 11. and it came to pass in
[1:11:46] those days when moses was grown
[1:11:48] that he went out unto his brethren and
[1:11:50] looked on their burdens
[1:11:52] and he spied an egyptian smiting in
[1:11:54] hebrew one of his brethren
[1:11:57] and he looked this way in that way and
[1:11:59] when he saw that there was no man he
[1:12:01] slew the egyptian and hid him in the
[1:12:03] sand
[1:12:04] and when he went out the second day
[1:12:06] behold two of the men of the hebrews
[1:12:08] strove together and he said to him that
[1:12:10] that did the wrong wherefores minus thou
[1:12:13] thy fellow and he said who made thee a
[1:12:16] prince and a judge over us and tendest
[1:12:18] thou to kill me as thou kill us the
[1:12:20] egyptian and moses feared and said
[1:12:22] surely this thing is known
[1:12:24] now when pharaoh heard this thing he
[1:12:26] sought to slay moses but moses fled from
[1:12:28] the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the
[1:12:30] land of midian and he sat down by a well
[1:12:35] brother branham says in the message
[1:12:36] proving his word
[1:12:38] also he proved it by moses and when
[1:12:40] moses when the difficulty was so against
[1:12:42] him moses had it in his mind that
[1:12:44] perhaps to be a deliverer that his
[1:12:46] mother had probably told him he was born
[1:12:48] a proper child she was his tutor that
[1:12:51] raised him up in pharaoh's palace no
[1:12:53] doubt had told him son we we have prayed
[1:12:57] that we'd be delivered and we believe
[1:12:59] that you are that child that god would
[1:13:00] use to deliver
[1:13:02] and and see he come up and was to be the
[1:13:06] son of pharaoh's daughter and we find
[1:13:08] out that he was to be heir to the throne
[1:13:10] why no doubt it was in her in their mind
[1:13:12] then that he would become the next
[1:13:14] pharaoh
[1:13:15] and that's how he would deliver the
[1:13:17] people by being the next pharaoh
[1:13:19] but if that would have been so then he
[1:13:21] would have done it through a material
[1:13:23] through an act of politics but god
[1:13:26] doesn't always work like that
[1:13:30] moses brother brown teaches us moses
[1:13:33] had an understanding that he was born a
[1:13:35] proper child and born to be a deliverer
[1:13:38] and he got that from his mother who was
[1:13:39] his nurse
[1:13:42] when when he was put as a baby into the
[1:13:45] little ark and floated down the nile his
[1:13:47] sister miriam followed along to see
[1:13:48] where the ark would go and the ark
[1:13:50] floated down and it went past pharaoh's
[1:13:52] daughter and and she sent a maiden into
[1:13:55] uh to pick it up and she said this is
[1:13:57] one of the hebrews children and miriam
[1:13:59] popped out right then and said would you
[1:14:01] like me to fetch a nurse
[1:14:03] for to nurse the baby and and she said
[1:14:06] yes and so he brought moses mother into
[1:14:08] the palace and paid her wages to to
[1:14:11] nurse
[1:14:12] little moses and so brother man picks up
[1:14:15] the rest of the story and tells us moses
[1:14:17] mother amen began to teach moses that he
[1:14:20] was born a proper child that there had
[1:14:22] been prayer for deliverance probably
[1:14:24] even that there was the prophecy to
[1:14:26] abraham
[1:14:27] i don't know exactly what he heard but
[1:14:29] what the prophet tells us she she began
[1:14:31] to tell him and and he began to believe
[1:14:34] that he was the deliverer
[1:14:36] he began to believe that he was the one
[1:14:39] the proper child and his
[1:14:41] and his faith wasn't wrong
[1:14:45] was he wrong
[1:14:46] no he was right
[1:14:48] he was wrong
[1:14:49] but then the idea began to circulate
[1:14:52] that you know when he becomes the next
[1:14:54] pharaoh and he could deliver he'll be in
[1:14:57] power he'll have armies and and he's
[1:14:59] learning military uh uh strategy and and
[1:15:01] he's and he's being trained brother bam
[1:15:03] teaches us all this he's being trained
[1:15:05] in the in the wisdom of egypt and he
[1:15:07] knows the language he knows the customs
[1:15:09] he knows that he knows uh uh all these
[1:15:12] things he's he's uh versed in science
[1:15:14] he's versed in politics he's versed in
[1:15:17] military uh conquest so he's the perfect
[1:15:20] man he's got everything he needs
[1:15:23] you know
[1:15:25] just like it looked like paul was the
[1:15:27] perfect man
[1:15:30] it looked like paul had everything he
[1:15:31] needed
[1:15:33] but everything paul had he had to lose
[1:15:35] to get what he really needed
[1:15:38] he had to die to it to gain what he
[1:15:40] really needed and now moses it looks
[1:15:42] like moses
[1:15:44] he's got
[1:15:45] all the tools and all the equipment
[1:15:47] necessary to be the deliverer that he's
[1:15:50] prophesied to be that he had a sign over
[1:15:53] him showing he would be amen and his
[1:15:55] family believed he would be but god
[1:15:57] doesn't work it that way it's not going
[1:15:59] to happen by material it's not going to
[1:16:01] happen by the mind of man
[1:16:02] moses is going to have to die to those
[1:16:05] things to be used by god
[1:16:07] the message a prisoner brother ben says
[1:16:09] god is looking for prisoners
[1:16:12] he's always done it
[1:16:14] you might search it through the
[1:16:15] scripture a man has to be a prisoner to
[1:16:17] christ against anything therefore you
[1:16:20] cannot be connected with anything but
[1:16:22] christ even your father your mother your
[1:16:24] brother your sister your husband your
[1:16:26] wife anybody you're only connected with
[1:16:28] christ and him only then god can use you
[1:16:31] until then you can't going out sometimes
[1:16:35] speaks rough speaks rough to people i'm
[1:16:37] trying to get you to cut loose you've
[1:16:39] got to have a starting place like
[1:16:41] someone sometime
[1:16:43] like sometimes calls out the woman
[1:16:45] bobbing her hair and wearing these
[1:16:46] clothes and hold and maintain their
[1:16:48] christian profession say that's a little
[1:16:50] thing well you've got to start somewhere
[1:16:53] so begin right there in your abcs and
[1:16:55] cut loose the worldly looks anyway and
[1:16:57] become a prisoner of christ and you just
[1:17:00] keep on cut loose everything until
[1:17:01] finally the last line is cut loose then
[1:17:04] you're you're a prisoner then you become
[1:17:06] in his grip and he's got you in his grip
[1:17:10] now moses know that he was born the
[1:17:12] deliverer he knew that and did you
[1:17:14] notice with the ambition that moses had
[1:17:16] knowing his mother had told him over
[1:17:18] there that as she was his nurse made
[1:17:21] no doubt when moses the little baby was
[1:17:23] born that his mother said you know moses
[1:17:25] your dad amram and i prayed constantly
[1:17:27] we knowed and seen in the word it was
[1:17:29] time for the coming of a deliverer and
[1:17:31] we prayed lord god we want to see that
[1:17:33] deliverer one night the lord told us in
[1:17:36] a vision that you would be born and you
[1:17:38] would be the deliverer we wasn't afraid
[1:17:40] of the king's commandment we didn't care
[1:17:42] what the king said then we know that you
[1:17:44] were born a deliverer now moses we know
[1:17:46] that we we couldn't bring you up right
[1:17:49] now remember they had been down there
[1:17:51] 400 years in egypt said when we wanted
[1:17:54] to get you the right thing the right
[1:17:56] education the right training so i took
[1:17:58] you and put you in a little ark and set
[1:18:00] you out in the nile and how strange that
[1:18:02] the currents taken that little ark down
[1:18:04] through the
[1:18:05] through the reeds and rushes and brought
[1:18:06] it right down miles away and turned it
[1:18:09] right into pharaoh's palace
[1:18:11] where pharaoh's daughter was where her
[1:18:13] bathing pool was and now that i know
[1:18:15] that she'd need a woman to raise you and
[1:18:18] in them days of course they didn't have
[1:18:19] those bottles to raise the babies on so
[1:18:21] she'd have to have a wet nurse
[1:18:23] and miriam i sent her down and she stood
[1:18:25] there and she said i know where i can
[1:18:27] find a wet nurse and come and got me and
[1:18:29] moses the doors all shut honey you're 16
[1:18:32] years old now and you're going to be
[1:18:34] pharaoh's son and someday you're going
[1:18:35] to be the deliverer that's going to take
[1:18:37] the people out of here
[1:18:40] moses ambition begin to grow i'll study
[1:18:42] mother i'll study everything i can you
[1:18:45] know what i'll do i'll study how to be a
[1:18:46] military man
[1:18:48] i'll know how this those people out
[1:18:50] there i'll take care of those people out
[1:18:52] there i'll be a great general bishop so
[1:18:54] i'll know how it's done and i'll take it
[1:18:56] out i'll get me a phd or ll i'll do it
[1:19:00] we know what happened to moses
[1:19:03] he got some level of confidence and
[1:19:06] understanding believed himself to be a
[1:19:08] deliverer and and when he began to see
[1:19:11] an egyptian
[1:19:13] smiting a a hebrew slave he went he
[1:19:15] killed that egyptian and he hit him in
[1:19:17] the sand and all of his intellect and
[1:19:20] all of his wisdom had brought him to
[1:19:21] this point but then he begins to get
[1:19:23] scared and he and he runs away and he
[1:19:25] runs dominion because pharaoh now wants
[1:19:27] to take his life his whole plan came
[1:19:30] crumbling down in one instant when
[1:19:33] pharaoh was angry with him and wanted to
[1:19:35] destroy him now all of his politics all
[1:19:38] of his uh education all of his
[1:19:41] connections in egypt were not going to
[1:19:44] do any good anymore
[1:19:46] god had stripped away in one instance
[1:19:48] everything that he was depending on
[1:19:50] everything that he was looking to
[1:19:52] everything that was going to make him
[1:19:53] able to do what he believed he was going
[1:19:55] to do was stripping away and he goes
[1:19:58] down in the midian and and it's as if
[1:20:01] the prophecy dies
[1:20:03] it's as if moses now to the egyptians is
[1:20:06] dead it's as if egypt is dead to him
[1:20:08] he's living a whole different kind of
[1:20:10] life he's living a whole different kind
[1:20:12] of lifestyle he's in a different land
[1:20:14] with different people married now
[1:20:16] raising a child tending his father's
[1:20:18] sheep i mean there's no more ambition to
[1:20:20] deliver the people there's no more hope
[1:20:22] it's dead
[1:20:26] because there's going to be a
[1:20:28] resurrection
[1:20:29] and the resurrection will glorify god
[1:20:33] not moses
[1:20:35] the resurrection there's only one person
[1:20:37] in the resurrection going to get the
[1:20:39] glory and it's not going to be moses
[1:20:41] it's not going to be the children of
[1:20:42] israel but it's going to be almighty god
[1:20:44] who's the only one who can bring this
[1:20:46] deliverance
[1:20:50] let's look at exodus chapter 3.
[1:20:56] in texas chapter 3 god comes and visits
[1:20:59] moses said i've heard the cry of my
[1:21:01] people i've come down to deliver him now
[1:21:02] i go i send you
[1:21:04] and we pick this up in verse 10 he says
[1:21:06] now come now therefore and i will send
[1:21:08] thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[1:21:10] forth my people the children of israel
[1:21:12] out of egypt and moses said unto god who
[1:21:16] am i
[1:21:17] that i should go unto pharaoh
[1:21:19] and that i should bring forth the
[1:21:20] children of israel out of egypt
[1:21:23] look at this statement
[1:21:26] we know he believed he was the deliverer
[1:21:29] he believed he was the one now he
[1:21:32] that whole dream has died
[1:21:35] that whole thing in moses is dead and
[1:21:38] moses is out here and god finally comes
[1:21:40] down now it's time for moses to move
[1:21:42] into that ministry moses is going to go
[1:21:45] into his purpose that god has for him
[1:21:47] and when god comes to him and says i'm
[1:21:49] sending you he says
[1:21:51] moses said god who am i that i should go
[1:21:54] into pharaoh and that i should bring
[1:21:55] forth the children of israel out of
[1:21:57] egypt
[1:21:59] i think it's safe to say that moses's
[1:22:01] ambition was dead
[1:22:03] moses's dreams were dead moses thoughts
[1:22:06] were dead moses plans were dead any hope
[1:22:09] that moses had of being the deliverer
[1:22:11] was dead until when god finally says all
[1:22:14] right boy now it's time he says who am i
[1:22:16] that i can go to fair i can't do this
[1:22:18] and we know because we talked last week
[1:22:20] about the dialogue that he sets up
[1:22:22] arguing with god and god has to deal
[1:22:25] with moses to get him to go because
[1:22:27] there is no plan b
[1:22:29] moses is the only one but god needed
[1:22:32] moses to die to himself to his ideas to
[1:22:36] him ambitions so that god could
[1:22:38] resurrect the purpose in his life
[1:22:40] because the only way that moses is going
[1:22:42] to come back into egypt is through a
[1:22:44] resurrection power resurrecting the
[1:22:46] purpose that god has in him
[1:22:48] why did it die because moses was going
[1:22:51] to do it according to his own purpose
[1:22:54] it died
[1:22:55] why do we find genesis
[1:22:57] 1 2
[1:22:59] in destruction because somehow whatever
[1:23:02] happened was no longer serving the
[1:23:04] purpose of god so it died so that it
[1:23:07] could be resurrected to serve the
[1:23:09] purpose of god
[1:23:11] moses now is dead to the
[1:23:15] the hebrews dead to the children of
[1:23:17] israel dead to egypt and egypt is dead
[1:23:20] to him
[1:23:22] he's dead as a deliverer he's dead with
[1:23:24] his idea of a deliverer it's dead
[1:23:27] because god is going to come with
[1:23:28] resurrection power and bring him right
[1:23:30] back to the purpose he had from him when
[1:23:32] he was born
[1:23:35] he couldn't do it on his own
[1:23:37] god didn't want him to do it on his own
[1:23:41] you know
[1:23:43] i don't know about you but when i came
[1:23:45] to the message
[1:23:46] i was going to save the world
[1:23:51] when i got the truth
[1:23:53] everyone was going to hear the truth
[1:23:56] and i understood it and i knew what the
[1:23:59] prophet was saying and i saw water
[1:24:01] baptism in jesus name and i saw serpent
[1:24:04] seed and i saw amen how a woman should
[1:24:06] dress and how a man should dress and
[1:24:08] conduct himself and i saw what was wrong
[1:24:10] with the denominational church and i i
[1:24:13] was going to take this to the world and
[1:24:15] i was going to save my whole family and
[1:24:16] i was going to save everybody and and i
[1:24:19] tell you those efforts amounted to
[1:24:20] nothing amen until i realized i can't
[1:24:23] save anybody i don't even completely
[1:24:25] understand the message right i i don't
[1:24:27] have it all figured out i'm no good at
[1:24:30] this and i failed every attempt that i
[1:24:32] had and then i would go to witness to
[1:24:34] somebody and end up getting so angry
[1:24:36] with them i would be in an argument with
[1:24:37] them and not displaying the life of
[1:24:39] christ
[1:24:42] until i slew an egyptian and hit him in
[1:24:44] the sand
[1:24:50] then you realized
[1:24:52] i'm nothing
[1:24:54] i have no power i have no strength i
[1:24:56] have no ability you know you start off
[1:24:58] i'm the bride of jesus christ amen you
[1:25:00] are the bride of jesus christ but if
[1:25:02] you're acting as the bride serving your
[1:25:04] own purpose in this life he'll let that
[1:25:06] vision die in you until you wonder
[1:25:08] whether you're bright or not
[1:25:11] he'll let you get sidelined he'll let
[1:25:13] you get weighed late he'll let you fall
[1:25:14] on your face god will let you die to
[1:25:17] your dream of being bride until you
[1:25:19] realize that you're nothing without him
[1:25:22] you're not bribed by your merit you're
[1:25:24] not bribed by your good looks you're not
[1:25:26] bribed by your wisdom or intellect
[1:25:27] you're not bright because of your good
[1:25:29] understanding your bride by his election
[1:25:31] and his election only and it was a
[1:25:33] purpose he purposed in you before the
[1:25:34] foundation of the world and the minute
[1:25:36] you stop serving his purpose and start
[1:25:39] serving your own purpose he'll let your
[1:25:41] dream of bride die
[1:25:43] until you find yourself in sin you find
[1:25:45] yourself in compromise you find yourself
[1:25:47] in confusion and you wonder who am i am
[1:25:50] i even until god will come to you and
[1:25:52] say you're my bride and you say who am i
[1:25:54] that i should be your bride who am i
[1:26:00] and this
[1:26:02] this this death is for a purpose amen
[1:26:05] we've got to die sometimes to our wrong
[1:26:07] thinking to our wrong ideas sometimes
[1:26:09] our children are raised down and we tell
[1:26:11] them you're a bride and you're this and
[1:26:13] you're that amen don't be too scared
[1:26:15] when god lets them fall flat amen don't
[1:26:18] be too nervous because god needs to
[1:26:20] break some of that wrong understanding
[1:26:22] till they can die to their concept of
[1:26:24] what it means
[1:26:26] to be bride die sometimes to their own
[1:26:29] ideas being raised in perfection being
[1:26:31] raised in the word amen some of them may
[1:26:33] have the wrong idea
[1:26:36] not all of them some of them have the
[1:26:37] right idea but if some of them have the
[1:26:40] wrong idea god is going to get his
[1:26:43] resurrection power on display
[1:26:47] and he'll let our vision sometimes of
[1:26:50] who we are die he'll let our
[1:26:52] understanding sometimes of who we are
[1:26:55] die
[1:26:57] just like he let paul
[1:26:59] die
[1:27:00] to his old life just like he let moses
[1:27:03] die
[1:27:05] so that he can bring a resurrection
[1:27:08] then all of a sudden in the resurrection
[1:27:11] when god begins to say you're my bride
[1:27:15] i want you to be a witness in the world
[1:27:16] you say who am i to be a witness you
[1:27:19] know i can't do anything right you know
[1:27:20] i'm a failure to start with you know i
[1:27:22] can't speak right you know i can't keep
[1:27:24] the doctrine dry you know i still don't
[1:27:26] feel like i completely understand
[1:27:28] everything
[1:27:32] praise be to god
[1:27:34] when you get to that place you're just
[1:27:36] about right
[1:27:39] that's why sometimes i
[1:27:41] i this is just a personal note just me
[1:27:43] personally
[1:27:45] i don't like the term my ministry
[1:27:48] i know brother branham used it and it's
[1:27:50] fine if somebody says it and the way
[1:27:51] brother baby i don't have a problem with
[1:27:53] that somebody say my ministry is this my
[1:27:55] ministry that in my ministry as long as
[1:27:57] the right attitude is behind it but i
[1:27:59] can't bring myself to say it because i
[1:28:01] don't want my ministry i don't want my
[1:28:03] own ministry i have no ministry i have
[1:28:05] nothing
[1:28:07] i i
[1:28:08] you know i i'm so far gone from
[1:28:12] believing that i'm a good pastor
[1:28:15] made so many mistakes and still confused
[1:28:17] on how to do things and don't understand
[1:28:19] how to do things right because there's
[1:28:20] no training there's no book i don't know
[1:28:23] amen there's i have no ministry i don't
[1:28:25] want a ministry if there's any ministry
[1:28:27] that comes through this flesh it's got
[1:28:29] to be the ministry of christ amen
[1:28:32] and sometimes god will let us even die
[1:28:34] to our idea of our ministry
[1:28:39] i've seen it so many times somebody'll
[1:28:41] get called into the ministry and it's
[1:28:42] like a flash goes off and also they
[1:28:44] minister several places it goes really
[1:28:46] well the people are super blessed then
[1:28:48] all of a sudden you don't hear anything
[1:28:49] from them for a while
[1:28:51] it's as if they go on a shelf
[1:28:53] and it's as if
[1:28:55] whatever happened
[1:28:57] and god will let that just simmer
[1:29:00] until you begin to doubt
[1:29:02] well maybe i said something wrong maybe
[1:29:04] god's not really going to use me maybe
[1:29:05] i'm not going to have the ministry i
[1:29:06] thought i thought i was going to be a
[1:29:08] traveling minister i thought i was going
[1:29:09] to be a pastor i thought i was in a
[1:29:11] venus now i have no idea what i am
[1:29:16] if you've ever ministered you know what
[1:29:17] i'm talking about
[1:29:19] i don't you know early on somebody would
[1:29:21] say are you an evangelist or you i have
[1:29:23] no idea what i am i don't know
[1:29:26] somebody said i even had somebody tell
[1:29:27] me well if god's called you he's got to
[1:29:29] tell you where you fit where your
[1:29:30] position is and i had to honestly
[1:29:32] goodness i have no idea i don't know if
[1:29:34] i'm an evangelist i don't know if i'm a
[1:29:35] missionary i don't know if i'm pastor i
[1:29:36] don't know what i am
[1:29:39] all i know is i can't do anything
[1:29:40] without him
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:44] do you have a ministry no i don't have a
[1:29:46] ministry
[1:29:48] because if i had a ministry i couldn't
[1:29:50] do you any good
[1:29:54] but he's got a ministry
[1:29:56] to work through the fivefold ministers
[1:29:59] it's his ministry
[1:30:03] we used to look to big ministers
[1:30:06] their ministry
[1:30:08] that ministry his ministry that man's
[1:30:10] ministry helped me that man's ministry
[1:30:12] taught me that man's ministry
[1:30:16] and it's not always wrong to use that
[1:30:17] terminology that's not wrong brother ben
[1:30:19] views the terminology but if you use it
[1:30:21] with the right attitude
[1:30:24] but with the wrong understanding that
[1:30:26] man's ministry happened me this ministry
[1:30:28] helped me that man
[1:30:30] the only one that will ever help you is
[1:30:32] the ministry of jesus christ through the
[1:30:34] five full ministry but if it's not the
[1:30:37] ministry of jesus christ you're going to
[1:30:39] fall flat somewhere
[1:30:41] somewhere along the line there's going
[1:30:42] to be a train wreck and everything's
[1:30:44] going to come to a halt and you're going
[1:30:45] to be what happened it's going to be
[1:30:47] like what happened to that person what
[1:30:49] happened to me what happened to my
[1:30:50] family what happened to our church
[1:30:53] because god will let it die
[1:30:56] so that he can resurrect it to his
[1:30:58] purpose
[1:30:59] he'll let us as individuals die so that
[1:31:02] he can resurrect us to his purpose he'll
[1:31:04] let churches die so he can resurrect
[1:31:06] that church to his purpose
[1:31:09] anybody who's been here for any length
[1:31:11] of time you know what it's like to see a
[1:31:13] church die
[1:31:14] die by falling off the word die by
[1:31:17] losing the spirit die amen die to pride
[1:31:21] die you know we had brother lonnie we
[1:31:23] had we had we had this we we've got this
[1:31:26] and we've got that and we've been around
[1:31:27] long enough to watch god let it die to
[1:31:30] where you were ashamed of where you went
[1:31:31] to church
[1:31:33] instead of being proud of the church you
[1:31:35] did you were ashamed to say i go to
[1:31:40] so that all that nonsense can die out of
[1:31:43] us and when all that nonsense gets
[1:31:45] washed up that i'm under this ministry
[1:31:47] and i'm attached to this and this great
[1:31:49] man and this great church until god can
[1:31:52] let all of that die in us until we can
[1:31:54] finally say who am i who are we we're
[1:31:57] absolutely nothing if god doesn't come
[1:31:59] work his purpose in us all we're going
[1:32:01] to do is ruin his purpose and he's going
[1:32:03] to let us go to another cycle of death
[1:32:07] and i don't want another cycle of death
[1:32:09] i want to stay in life amen i want to
[1:32:11] stay in life and the only way to stay in
[1:32:12] life is to reckon yourself dead but
[1:32:15] alive in christ dead to the world dead
[1:32:17] to the systems dead to carnal thinking
[1:32:20] and alive in christ
[1:32:23] so moses could come and say i'm no
[1:32:26] deliverer
[1:32:29] what did you do moses
[1:32:31] one egyptian
[1:32:34] and then i ran away scared
[1:32:39] but but what about
[1:32:41] the plagues what about the rod what
[1:32:44] about the sign of leprosy in your hand
[1:32:46] what about the mighty works that god did
[1:32:48] to you what about the parting of the red
[1:32:50] sea what about and he says i didn't do
[1:32:52] any of that
[1:32:54] that wasn't me
[1:32:56] my ministry produced one dead egyptian
[1:32:59] and i ran away scared
[1:33:02] and delayed
[1:33:03] the exodus
[1:33:07] but his ministry
[1:33:10] brought the plagues
[1:33:11] redeemed his children out of egypt
[1:33:14] parted the red sea turned a bitter water
[1:33:16] sweet
[1:33:17] his ministry did that
[1:33:20] so i love so much and brother brandon
[1:33:22] brother branham said i wasn't the one
[1:33:23] who did those things i was just standing
[1:33:26] near when he did them
[1:33:31] and so so many times that term my
[1:33:34] ministry or your ministry
[1:33:36] or his ministry
[1:33:40] let's just lose all of that thinking
[1:33:41] right now
[1:33:43] and let it all die
[1:33:45] and say if anything good comes it's the
[1:33:47] ministry of
[1:33:48] christ that word depending he's the
[1:33:51] deliverer
[1:33:52] he's the minister
[1:33:54] he's the divider of the word
[1:33:57] it's all him
[1:33:59] there's nothing we can do and then we
[1:34:01] get to a place as a church through
[1:34:03] humility which says we're not a great
[1:34:05] church
[1:34:06] we're nothing look at where we came from
[1:34:08] look at what we participated in look at
[1:34:10] how we died
[1:34:13] we're not a great church
[1:34:15] we're not a great people
[1:34:17] we're not wonderful
[1:34:20] all i am is a vessel he wants to use for
[1:34:22] his purpose
[1:34:24] and when there was humility
[1:34:26] god brought a resurrection
[1:34:29] with humility and brokenness with the
[1:34:32] right understanding of who we really are
[1:34:34] amen with failure in ourselves and trust
[1:34:38] in god and a reliance on his word he
[1:34:40] brings a resurrection and now the
[1:34:43] resurrection of even this local assembly
[1:34:45] is to serve his purpose
[1:34:48] but i'll guarantee you this if we ever
[1:34:50] stop serving his purpose and start
[1:34:52] serving our own he'll let it die again
[1:34:56] because it must serve his purpose and if
[1:34:58] in our families we start serving our own
[1:35:00] purpose he'll let the family crumble
[1:35:04] if our marriages are only serving our
[1:35:05] purpose he'll let marital trouble come
[1:35:07] amen if there's if our family is our
[1:35:09] purpose then god will let trouble in our
[1:35:11] family come our families are put
[1:35:13] together to serve his purposes our
[1:35:15] marriages are put together to shine his
[1:35:17] life our churches are put together to
[1:35:19] serve his purpose amen certain brothers
[1:35:21] are given to certain places in the
[1:35:23] faithful ministry to serve his purpose
[1:35:25] amen but it's all his purpose and it let
[1:35:28] everything else die so that he can
[1:35:30] resurrect his people to his purpose
[1:35:33] [Applause]
[1:35:35] so he can resurrect your family to his
[1:35:37] purpose he can resurrect your marriage
[1:35:39] to his purpose he can resurrect your
[1:35:41] church to his purpose he can resurrect
[1:35:43] your amen your gift in your life to his
[1:35:46] purpose
[1:35:48] i mean god will there'll be there'll be
[1:35:50] gifts even a gift of writing songs a
[1:35:52] gift of singing amen it'll sometimes
[1:35:55] take off like a rocket there'll be a
[1:35:57] song that blesses everybody amen you'll
[1:35:59] find it sung in churches all over and
[1:36:01] then if somebody begins to think well my
[1:36:03] gift
[1:36:08] my gift
[1:36:10] then all of a sudden
[1:36:12] bang
[1:36:14] it may not even believe you lost a gift
[1:36:15] it may be somewhere else in your life
[1:36:18] until you can get to moses
[1:36:20] and say who am i lord to write a song
[1:36:25] who am i lord to stand in front of the
[1:36:27] people and sing
[1:36:29] who am i lord to play an instrument on
[1:36:31] the platform who am i
[1:36:33] who am i lord to stand in the point who
[1:36:36] am i to travel to the floor who am i
[1:36:40] who am i lord i
[1:36:42] they won't receive me i'm a failure
[1:36:46] well throw the rod down
[1:36:48] look at your hand but i can't talk right
[1:36:51] and i can't get it right and i i'll make
[1:36:53] another mistake
[1:36:57] praise god
[1:36:59] let him
[1:37:01] just die just go ahead and die and let
[1:37:03] him bring a resurrection
[1:37:06] because everything that serves his
[1:37:08] purpose
[1:37:09] has a resurrection
[1:37:12] if you find yourself used of god at one
[1:37:14] time and now sitting on the shelf
[1:37:16] just be humble
[1:37:18] just be broken
[1:37:20] just recognize that you're nothing
[1:37:23] and let him resurrect you
[1:37:26] let him resurrect his purpose in you
[1:37:32] praise be to god
[1:37:34] the apostle paul says
[1:37:36] for i am the least of the apostles
[1:37:40] praise god that was a man god could use
[1:37:44] the least of the apostles wrote almost
[1:37:47] the entire new testament
[1:37:50] the least of the apostles was the first
[1:37:52] church age messenger
[1:37:53] the least of the apostles was the only
[1:37:55] one that understood grace correctly
[1:37:59] the least of the apostles
[1:38:01] but his attitude towards himself is what
[1:38:04] made him usable by god
[1:38:07] for i am the least of the apostles that
[1:38:09] i am not meat to be called an apostle
[1:38:11] because i persecuted the church of god
[1:38:14] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:38:16] and his grace which was bestowed upon me
[1:38:18] was not in vain but i labored more
[1:38:21] abundantly than they all yet not i
[1:38:24] oh it sounded like he was going to go
[1:38:26] the wrong direction let's read this
[1:38:28] again
[1:38:29] i'm lisa the apostles not even worthy to
[1:38:31] be called an apostle because i
[1:38:32] persecuted the church what was it his
[1:38:35] failure kept him in humility
[1:38:38] his death amen after the resurrection he
[1:38:40] still remembered what he
[1:38:43] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:38:46] so how is any of us what we are
[1:38:49] how is it your bride how is it you have
[1:38:51] a gift in your life how is it you have a
[1:38:52] position in the church by the grace of
[1:38:54] god i am what i am
[1:38:58] and this grace which was bestowed upon
[1:39:00] me was not in vain
[1:39:01] but i labored more abundantly than they
[1:39:04] all so he used the word i
[1:39:06] i labored more abundantly in the all and
[1:39:09] then he says yet not i
[1:39:12] but the grace of god which was with me
[1:39:15] it wasn't i
[1:39:16] it was the grace of god that was with me
[1:39:19] i'm not the one that opens the blinded
[1:39:21] eyes i'm not the one amen that was that
[1:39:24] came down at the river i'm not the one
[1:39:26] that does all those all these miracles i
[1:39:27] was only standing by when he did it
[1:39:29] wasn't i it was the grace of god that
[1:39:31] was with me
[1:39:33] it was it's not i it's the spirit of god
[1:39:36] working through this this vessel of clay
[1:39:38] the vessel of clay without the spirit of
[1:39:40] god is nothing
[1:39:44] in the message it is the rising of the
[1:39:46] sun
[1:39:47] as christ was the first one to raise
[1:39:49] from all the prophets and so forth
[1:39:51] although typed in many places he was the
[1:39:53] first fruits of those that slept
[1:39:55] and the bride coming of christ coming
[1:39:57] out of the church they'll have to be a
[1:39:58] sheaf waved again in the last days oh my
[1:40:01] waving of the sheaf what was the sheath
[1:40:03] the first one that come to mature the
[1:40:05] first one that proved it was a wheat it
[1:40:07] proved it was a sheaf hallelujah i'm
[1:40:09] sure you see what i'm talking about it
[1:40:11] was waved over the people and the first
[1:40:13] time there will come forth for the bride
[1:40:14] age for a resurrection out of dark
[1:40:17] denominationalism
[1:40:20] what is this that we're in the
[1:40:22] resurrection
[1:40:24] resurrected out of dark
[1:40:25] denominationalism it died it went into
[1:40:28] the dark ages and died the seed went
[1:40:30] into the ground and rotted the tree was
[1:40:33] cut down to the stump with no life amen
[1:40:35] it was as if it was dead but it can't
[1:40:37] die because there's a purpose laying
[1:40:39] there
[1:40:41] no more than you can die because there's
[1:40:42] a purpose laying in you it couldn't die
[1:40:44] because there's a purpose laying in
[1:40:46] there so out of death he brings life out
[1:40:49] of the cycle of death because there's a
[1:40:52] purpose laying in that church he begins
[1:40:54] to restore i will restore saith the lord
[1:40:57] because i have a purpose amen in all of
[1:41:00] this and my purpose i will be glorified
[1:41:03] in the resurrection of the church amen
[1:41:06] now we can say i'm bride we've been
[1:41:08] restored to what the church was supposed
[1:41:10] to be at pentecost when it came forth it
[1:41:12] was supposed to move on in the word but
[1:41:13] they left we've been brought back to
[1:41:15] that so that we can move on to where
[1:41:16] they were supposed to go amen praise god
[1:41:19] i love that truth but that truth has
[1:41:22] nothing to do with me it's his purpose
[1:41:24] in my life this resurrection that's
[1:41:26] taking place in me and you is not for me
[1:41:29] and you this resurrection is to glorify
[1:41:31] god and it's to bring glory to the son
[1:41:33] of god
[1:41:36] the church
[1:41:38] amen restored back to power the church
[1:41:41] restored back to truth the church
[1:41:43] restored back to a life the church
[1:41:46] restored back to bearing fruit it has
[1:41:48] nothing to do with you being glorified
[1:41:51] it has nothing to do with proving you
[1:41:53] lazarus life had nothing to do with
[1:41:55] proving lazarus lazarus didn't raise
[1:41:57] himself from the dead
[1:41:59] jairus daughter it wasn't about jairus's
[1:42:02] daughter there was one central theme in
[1:42:04] every resurrection and every
[1:42:06] resurrection pointed to one person it
[1:42:08] pointed to the person of jesus christ
[1:42:10] and this resurrection in this day has to
[1:42:12] point to one person and one person only
[1:42:15] it has to point to the living breathing
[1:42:18] jesus christ that's among us today it's
[1:42:21] him it's not us it's him it's not church
[1:42:24] buildings it's not assemblies it's not
[1:42:26] ministers it's him
[1:42:30] that's why there's a resurrection in
[1:42:32] this day
[1:42:33] that's why it died
[1:42:35] so that he could resurrect it so that it
[1:42:37] could glorify god and manifest the son
[1:42:40] of god
[1:42:41] the reason you have power to believe in
[1:42:43] healing the reason you have power to
[1:42:45] overcome the reason your family lines up
[1:42:47] the reason your life comes in order the
[1:42:49] reason you can live morality the reason
[1:42:51] you can turn your head the reason you
[1:42:53] can hear the word the reason you're not
[1:42:55] deceived by false doctrine is for his
[1:42:57] glory and his manifestation not for
[1:42:59] yours
[1:43:01] because without him and without his
[1:43:03] purpose in your life you would be just
[1:43:05] as lost as every other human being is
[1:43:06] lost stuck in some system or worse
[1:43:12] but this resurrection in me
[1:43:14] is him
[1:43:16] and for him
[1:43:19] lazarus was a testimony
[1:43:22] of the power of god in christ
[1:43:26] every day that lazarus lived upon the
[1:43:29] earth
[1:43:30] could you imagine coming somebody coming
[1:43:32] and asking lazarus dumb questions
[1:43:35] lazarus when you were laying there dead
[1:43:39] were you praying
[1:43:41] was he responding to your prayer
[1:43:43] did you pull him toward
[1:43:46] lazarus was dead in the flesh
[1:43:49] there was nothing more he could do
[1:43:51] to save himself
[1:43:53] there was nothing he could do to help
[1:43:55] himself there was nothing he could do to
[1:43:57] change his situation
[1:44:00] can you imagine if they built a shrine
[1:44:01] to lazarus and started the church of
[1:44:03] lazarus and lazarus became the pastor
[1:44:06] because he was resurrected
[1:44:08] we all have in faith we all have got
[1:44:10] faith we go to the right church because
[1:44:11] we go to the church where lazarus was
[1:44:12] right it had nothing to do with lazarus
[1:44:16] but you see we get the same kind of
[1:44:19] thinking
[1:44:21] we see somebody very much gifted by god
[1:44:24] we see somebody with a powerful ministry
[1:44:27] or a powerful gift in their life and
[1:44:28] everybody wants to go to that church
[1:44:30] because that's where
[1:44:32] the resurrection proved christ not that
[1:44:34] vessel lazarus had nothing to do with it
[1:44:37] it wasn't lazarus you attached yourself
[1:44:39] to it was christ who rose lazarus that
[1:44:41] you attached yourself to
[1:44:44] it's not i mean i'm sure everybody
[1:44:45] appreciated lazarus i mean i would have
[1:44:47] appreciated lazarus but lazarus he had
[1:44:49] nothing to do with it
[1:44:52] his resurrected life was not by his own
[1:44:54] power his resurrected life was by the
[1:44:56] power of jesus christ amen in our
[1:44:58] resurrected life if there's anything
[1:45:00] good anywhere around any of us if
[1:45:02] there's a gift if there's an ability if
[1:45:04] there's an understanding if there's a
[1:45:06] life lived it's not us it's proof of a
[1:45:09] resurrection amen it's proof of one who
[1:45:11] has the power of resurrection in our
[1:45:13] lives
[1:45:17] we have to keep the right attitude in
[1:45:18] the right approach
[1:45:21] without the right attitude in the right
[1:45:23] approach
[1:45:24] god will let something die
[1:45:26] when it stops serving his purpose
[1:45:31] but if it has his purpose it'll live
[1:45:33] again
[1:45:35] if it's his seed his child it will live
[1:45:38] again
[1:45:39] but in order to magnify him it's got to
[1:45:42] die
[1:45:43] so that he can bring the resurrection
[1:45:46] so that this resurrection will glorify
[1:45:49] him
[1:45:51] if we get a little too big
[1:45:53] for our britches
[1:45:56] god has thousands of ways to let us die
[1:46:00] if we get a little too puffed up and a
[1:46:01] little too proud about where we are
[1:46:04] who we are associating with or what we
[1:46:06] know or
[1:46:07] the life that we live we get a little
[1:46:09] bit too proud about that god has ways to
[1:46:11] let us die
[1:46:13] he has many ways to let us come to a
[1:46:15] place where we realize who am i
[1:46:19] who am i to call myself bride
[1:46:22] who am i to be proud
[1:46:24] who am i to speak to somebody who am i
[1:46:27] to deliver who am i
[1:46:32] you know god never says moses you're a
[1:46:34] great one i'm i'm sending you he says
[1:46:37] i've come down to deliver them
[1:46:41] i'm not asking you to do anything
[1:46:44] i'm asking you to surrender to my
[1:46:46] purpose in your life and i'll do it
[1:46:49] god's not asking us friends to use our
[1:46:52] power and use our abilities he's asking
[1:46:54] us to completely surrender to his
[1:46:55] purpose that's locked in our lives
[1:46:58] and then he'll come and do the work
[1:47:00] there's anything good that's ever going
[1:47:02] to happen in this end time there's only
[1:47:03] going to be a tremendous manifestation
[1:47:06] it's going to be him
[1:47:09] proving his resurrection
[1:47:11] for his glory
[1:47:16] and the message the way back he says
[1:47:18] it takes death
[1:47:20] to produce life you've got to die to
[1:47:23] your own thinking you've got to die to
[1:47:24] your own theology you've got to die to
[1:47:26] your own self to your own human ways
[1:47:28] you've got to be regenerated a new
[1:47:30] creature a new creation before you can
[1:47:32] be them you can't be two at the same
[1:47:34] time you got to die to one in order to
[1:47:37] be born in the other
[1:47:39] saul had to die to his idea
[1:47:43] of what was right and wrong and his idea
[1:47:45] of how he could serve god
[1:47:47] and then he could be converted to paul
[1:47:49] and then he can be used for god's
[1:47:50] purpose
[1:47:52] moses had to die to his idea of a
[1:47:54] deliverer and what a deliverer was and
[1:47:56] how you deliver
[1:47:58] until he got to where he could do
[1:48:00] nothing say nothing be nothing and then
[1:48:02] god could take him and be the deliverer
[1:48:05] through him
[1:48:08] you got to die to yourself
[1:48:11] if if i'm ever going to manifest the
[1:48:14] bride of jesus christ if i'm ever going
[1:48:15] to be the bride
[1:48:17] it's going to be his bride life in me
[1:48:19] living out
[1:48:21] not my own idea of what a bride is
[1:48:24] not my own idea
[1:48:26] but it's going to be his life living
[1:48:28] through me
[1:48:30] let's look at one more scripture
[1:48:31] together before we close let's turn to
[1:48:33] luke 24.
[1:48:55] luke 24 17.
[1:49:00] this is after the resurrection
[1:49:04] in the road to emmaus the two are
[1:49:06] walking along sad and grieved verse 17
[1:49:09] he says and he said unto them what
[1:49:11] manner of communications are these that
[1:49:13] you have one to another as you walk and
[1:49:15] are sad
[1:49:17] and one of them whose name was cleopas
[1:49:19] answered and said unto him art thou only
[1:49:20] a stranger in jerusalem and has not
[1:49:22] known the things which are come to pass
[1:49:24] there in these days
[1:49:25] and he said unto them what things and
[1:49:28] they said unto him concerning jesus of
[1:49:29] nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[1:49:32] indeed in word before god and all the
[1:49:34] people and how the chief priests and our
[1:49:36] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[1:49:38] death and have crucified him
[1:49:41] but we trusted that it had been he which
[1:49:43] should have redeemed israel beside all
[1:49:45] this today is the third day since these
[1:49:48] things were done
[1:49:50] yea and certain women also of our
[1:49:51] company made us astonished which were
[1:49:54] early
[1:49:55] at the sepulcher and when they found
[1:49:57] nada's body they came saying that they
[1:49:59] had also seen a vision of angels
[1:50:02] which said that that he was alive
[1:50:05] and certain of them which were with us
[1:50:07] went to the sepulcher and found it even
[1:50:08] so as the women had said but they saw
[1:50:11] him not then he said unto them o fools
[1:50:13] and slow of heart to believe all that
[1:50:15] the prophets had spoken ought not christ
[1:50:17] to have suffered these things and to
[1:50:19] enter into his glory
[1:50:22] you can see they're walking along
[1:50:24] distraught
[1:50:26] all
[1:50:27] and they said verse 21
[1:50:29] but we trusted that it had been he which
[1:50:32] should have redeemed israel
[1:50:35] but we trusted it had been he that
[1:50:38] should redeem israel
[1:50:40] and they had the right idea
[1:50:43] but they had it in the wrong application
[1:50:47] and they thought they understood the
[1:50:49] word
[1:50:51] they thought they understood the
[1:50:52] prophecies they thought they could see
[1:50:54] what was coming to pass they thought
[1:50:56] they were in the right thing at the
[1:50:58] right time believing the right way
[1:51:01] but when something happened unexpected
[1:51:05] when things turned in a way that they
[1:51:07] didn't predict and all of a sudden jesus
[1:51:10] christ was crucified they saw him suffer
[1:51:12] they knew he was arrested tried beaten
[1:51:15] suffered laid in a tomb as dead amen all
[1:51:18] the sudden all their ideas they begin to
[1:51:21] have questions and now instead of saying
[1:51:24] he redeemed israel they said we trusted
[1:51:26] it had been him that redeemed israel but
[1:51:28] now we're not trusting that anymore
[1:51:32] and jesus says all
[1:51:34] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:51:38] you thought you knew something but you
[1:51:40] didn't know it all
[1:51:42] you thought you had it figured out but
[1:51:44] when god does something unexpected amen
[1:51:47] all of a sudden what you thought you had
[1:51:48] figured out now creates a new a doubt
[1:51:51] now you don't know we had trusted and
[1:51:53] now we don't know and they went to the
[1:51:55] sepulchre they couldn't find the body
[1:51:56] and right before them was the
[1:51:58] resurrection and they couldn't even see
[1:52:00] it because of what they thought
[1:52:05] and now jesus begins to humble them and
[1:52:07] says fools and slow of heart
[1:52:10] they're dying listen the disciples went
[1:52:14] through a death experience at calvary
[1:52:16] they died to every notion they had of
[1:52:19] what the coming kingdom was
[1:52:22] they were asking silly questions like
[1:52:25] who will sit on your eye and who will
[1:52:26] sit on your left who will be greatest
[1:52:28] among us amen
[1:52:30] they they they they
[1:52:32] you know peter declaring lord though
[1:52:34] offers say you i'll never forsake you
[1:52:36] i'm willing to die for you all of these
[1:52:38] crazy notions amen they had their own
[1:52:40] ideas and their own purposes the fact
[1:52:43] that they would ask if they could sit on
[1:52:44] the throne on his right or left hand
[1:52:46] proved that they were in this with their
[1:52:48] own purpose
[1:52:51] peter getting caught up in the argument
[1:52:53] of who's the greatest among them proves
[1:52:55] that the disciples were looking at their
[1:52:57] own purpose
[1:53:00] and as long as you have your own purpose
[1:53:03] god will let that die
[1:53:06] and friends i tell you we never had to
[1:53:09] go anything through anything like they
[1:53:10] went through
[1:53:13] i mean they were standing there watching
[1:53:15] the bread multiplied
[1:53:18] they watched the man receive his
[1:53:20] eyesight they watched the lame walk they
[1:53:23] they were with him they heard his
[1:53:25] parables they heard the stories they
[1:53:27] heard the explanation behind closed
[1:53:29] doors of the parables
[1:53:31] they knew that this was the son of god
[1:53:34] peter received a revelation from god
[1:53:36] they they were in the right thing at the
[1:53:38] right time they were chosen he said i've
[1:53:40] chosen you you haven't chosen me they
[1:53:42] were chosen in the right thing at the
[1:53:44] right time but they had their own
[1:53:47] purpose mixed in
[1:53:50] and because they had their own purpose
[1:53:51] mixed in
[1:53:52] it didn't happen according to their
[1:53:54] thinking
[1:53:55] god let all their ideas die
[1:53:59] until they scattered and ran away and
[1:54:02] hid
[1:54:04] and these two on the road to mass didn't
[1:54:06] even know what they believed anymore
[1:54:09] they got to the place where they weren't
[1:54:11] even sure about what had happened and
[1:54:13] weren't even sure they said we had
[1:54:15] trusted we trusted that it had been him
[1:54:20] but we don't even really know what we
[1:54:21] believe anymore
[1:54:25] praise be to god they were still chosen
[1:54:29] they were still the right ones
[1:54:31] in the right season
[1:54:33] but he had to resurrect his purpose in
[1:54:35] his life for his glory not for theirs
[1:54:40] let's look at john
[1:54:41] 21
[1:54:48] john 21
[1:54:52] verse 1
[1:54:58] after these things jesus showed himself
[1:55:01] again to the disciples at the sea of
[1:55:03] tiberias and on this wise showed he
[1:55:05] himself says after these things
[1:55:08] what things if you look just above in
[1:55:09] the previous chapter jesus comes and
[1:55:12] steps into the room and reveals himself
[1:55:13] as resurrected tells thomas to take his
[1:55:16] finger and touch it in his hand and
[1:55:18] thrust his hand into his side and then
[1:55:20] it says just before this verse 30 and
[1:55:21] many other signs truly did jesus in the
[1:55:23] presence of his disciples which are not
[1:55:25] written in this book but these are
[1:55:27] written that you might believe
[1:55:30] so
[1:55:31] after these things after jesus declares
[1:55:33] himself resurrected
[1:55:35] after jesus amen proves that he was the
[1:55:38] one
[1:55:39] after these things
[1:55:42] it says verse 2
[1:55:44] they were together simon peter and
[1:55:46] thomas called didymus and nathanael of
[1:55:48] cana and galilean the son of zebedee and
[1:55:51] two others of his disciples
[1:55:53] simon peter said unto them i go fishing
[1:55:57] after these things after they saw jesus
[1:56:01] christ resurrected after thomas had the
[1:56:04] opportunity to touch him after he threw
[1:56:06] many signs and infallible proofs
[1:56:07] declared himself to them
[1:56:10] peter has so lost his vision of being
[1:56:13] the greatest disciple
[1:56:15] peter has so lost his vision of being
[1:56:17] the warrior for the kingdom
[1:56:20] he says i go fishing
[1:56:23] what else can i do
[1:56:25] and he goes back
[1:56:27] to his humble lifestyle that he had
[1:56:30] before
[1:56:31] a fisherman
[1:56:33] when god called him from fishing to be a
[1:56:36] fisher of men
[1:56:38] and he had lived a glorious
[1:56:40] three to three and a half years of
[1:56:42] ministry with jesus christ when he saw
[1:56:44] the miraculously he practice he
[1:56:47] participated in the miraculous he
[1:56:49] declared he had declarations of
[1:56:51] revelations from the father he had all
[1:56:53] these things and after it all comes
[1:56:55] crumbling down and he dies to his own
[1:56:58] dream of being a great man in the
[1:57:00] kingdom of god to being a great person
[1:57:03] he says i go fishing
[1:57:05] he didn't know what else to do but go
[1:57:07] back
[1:57:08] in humility go back to fishing
[1:57:12] and it says
[1:57:15] peter sayeth unto them i go fishing they
[1:57:17] say unto him we go
[1:57:19] we also go with thee
[1:57:21] they went forth and entered into a ship
[1:57:23] immediately and that and that night they
[1:57:25] caught nothing
[1:57:27] but when the morning was now come jesus
[1:57:28] stood on the shore
[1:57:30] but the disciples knew not that it was
[1:57:32] jesus
[1:57:33] then jesus saith unto them children have
[1:57:36] you any meat they answered him no
[1:57:39] and he said in them cast a net on the
[1:57:41] right side of the ship and you shall
[1:57:43] find they cast therefore and now they
[1:57:46] were not able to draw for the multitude
[1:57:48] of fishes therefore that disciple whom
[1:57:50] jesus loved saith to peter it is the
[1:57:52] lord now when simon peter heard that it
[1:57:54] was the lord he gird his fisher coat
[1:57:56] unto him for he was naked and then cast
[1:57:58] himself into the sea
[1:58:00] he went swimming to jesus because he
[1:58:02] wanted to be where jesus was but but
[1:58:05] think about this friends peter had gone
[1:58:08] through the cycle of life and death he
[1:58:10] had gone through the transition of a
[1:58:12] dream a hope a position with christ
[1:58:15] power and manifestation and glory he
[1:58:18] shared when and he shared in jesus
[1:58:20] ministry
[1:58:22] and then at the crucifixion it all come
[1:58:24] tumbling down and in his failure and in
[1:58:27] the denying of christ he had doubts
[1:58:29] about himself he doubted his position
[1:58:31] now he's not striving for anything even
[1:58:34] though he's seen the resurrected jesus
[1:58:36] christ he goes back to fishing because
[1:58:38] god's going to take him right back to
[1:58:40] where he started so that he can start
[1:58:42] again
[1:58:44] christ came to him as a fisherman in the
[1:58:47] sea and now christ comes back to him as
[1:58:50] a fisherman in the sea because christ is
[1:58:52] going to resurrect him amen this and
[1:58:55] this resurrection is not going to be
[1:58:58] about peter in this resurrection it's
[1:59:00] going to be about christ
[1:59:03] amen
[1:59:05] he let him go through the whole cycle
[1:59:08] so that peter will wash out his own
[1:59:10] purpose
[1:59:11] until at the end of peter's life amen
[1:59:14] peter in the book of second peter he
[1:59:16] said the lord's revealed to me that my
[1:59:17] departure is at hand
[1:59:20] he's not fighting it he's not running
[1:59:22] away afraid he's not he's not scared
[1:59:24] anymore because now it's not about what
[1:59:27] peter wants it's not about his position
[1:59:29] it's not about his power now it's about
[1:59:32] god's purpose in peter
[1:59:36] i tell you sometimes god lets us run
[1:59:39] through a cycle of life and death
[1:59:42] so that he can come in resurrection
[1:59:44] power
[1:59:46] and bring us back to life
[1:59:49] peter
[1:59:50] came back to being what he was always
[1:59:53] meant to be
[1:59:55] but this time around peter's attitude
[1:59:57] was completely different
[2:00:00] peter's demeanor his approach
[2:00:02] his attitude towards other believers
[2:00:06] peter wanted to be the greatest among
[2:00:07] them peter was willing to cut off
[2:00:09] anybody's head that was against christ
[2:00:12] then when you find peter later
[2:00:15] peter now is humble and he's submissive
[2:00:18] and he's good to the brethren
[2:00:22] something changed
[2:00:24] through death and resurrection and now
[2:00:27] peter's life
[2:00:28] is not glorifying peter
[2:00:30] but peter's life is glorifying the
[2:00:33] purpose that god had in him
[2:00:35] from before the foundation of the world
[2:00:39] i say now's a good time to die
[2:00:43] surrender
[2:00:44] give up
[2:00:45] forget about ourselves
[2:00:47] get as low as we can possibly get
[2:00:51] get rid of odd notions about power and
[2:00:53] glory and position
[2:00:56] throw them all away
[2:00:58] give up any idea about being
[2:01:01] a
[2:01:02] a good believer with a great
[2:01:04] understanding in a good church and
[2:01:06] attached to a good ministry throw all
[2:01:08] that away
[2:01:11] and come and say lord who am i
[2:01:14] i'm least of the disciples like paul i'm
[2:01:18] least of the i am least
[2:01:20] of the apostles and not even worthy to
[2:01:22] be called an apostle because i
[2:01:23] persecuted the church
[2:01:26] listen let's get real
[2:01:27] we're at least of the bride and not even
[2:01:29] worthy to be called bride because of the
[2:01:31] doubts that have been expressed in our
[2:01:32] life because of the failures that we've
[2:01:34] had because the times we've gone against
[2:01:37] the word
[2:01:38] willingly
[2:01:40] after our new birth
[2:01:44] i'm bright i'm least to the bride
[2:01:48] can we get to the place where we can say
[2:01:49] i'm least of the bride
[2:01:51] and not worthy to be called his bride
[2:01:55] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[2:01:58] and now god help me not to live to my
[2:02:01] purpose in this life but help me god to
[2:02:04] die to any ambition
[2:02:06] any selfishness any of my own purpose
[2:02:09] and let me live your purpose in this
[2:02:11] life
[2:02:13] let me die to all my old ideas about
[2:02:15] what i was and my old ideas about how
[2:02:18] great i was let me die to all of that
[2:02:20] and will you resurrect your purpose in
[2:02:22] me so that you can get resurrection
[2:02:24] glory
[2:02:26] in my life
[2:02:28] amen
[2:02:30] if you serve god's purpose
[2:02:33] you will have a resurrection
[2:02:36] if you serve your own purpose
[2:02:38] god will crumple it like he did the
[2:02:40] earth in genesis 1
[2:02:42] but he won't leave it that way
[2:02:45] because there's a purpose laying there
[2:02:47] you'll bring it back in a resurrection
[2:02:50] if god's purpose lays in your life and
[2:02:52] you serve your own purpose
[2:02:54] there's a judgment coming there's a
[2:02:55] crumpling coming there's a collapse
[2:02:57] heading your way
[2:02:58] but don't lose heart his purpose hasn't
[2:03:01] went anywhere
[2:03:02] the resurrection will come
[2:03:05] and bring you back to his purpose
[2:03:08] and then we'll go back like moses went
[2:03:10] back to egypt we'll go into we're going
[2:03:12] to the churches of asia minor like paul
[2:03:14] went to the churches of asia minor we'll
[2:03:16] live a life like brother branham lived
[2:03:18] knowing that it wasn't him that it was
[2:03:20] the one who was standing near him
[2:03:22] when these things happened
[2:03:24] and if any good thing happens it'll
[2:03:26] happen because he
[2:03:28] did it himself
[2:03:30] and let's all stand musicians if you'll
[2:03:33] come please
[2:03:36] well the member says in the identified
[2:03:37] christ of all ages
[2:03:39] he said just like it takes death to
[2:03:41] yourself to develop the picture of the
[2:03:44] image of christ the life of christ in
[2:03:46] you
[2:03:47] you have to dump your own out so that
[2:03:50] christ can come in
[2:03:51] you have to die
[2:03:53] to yourself
[2:03:56] amen if you find yourself here
[2:03:59] having the wrong idea about things and
[2:04:01] that was exposed to you now is a good
[2:04:03] time to repent and say lord i'm nothing
[2:04:06] forgive me lord for pride forgive me
[2:04:08] lord for all these foolish notions
[2:04:10] forgive me
[2:04:12] if you're here and your life has been
[2:04:14] crushed and you've been flattened
[2:04:16] and you've fallen in sin you've failed
[2:04:18] somehow and you're where you're where
[2:04:20] moses was who am i
[2:04:22] who am i to be the bride who am i to
[2:04:24] share these glory's truth who am i
[2:04:26] if you're sitting here in that position
[2:04:29] praise god realize that the resurrection
[2:04:31] is coming to you
[2:04:33] this morning
[2:04:34] to bring you back into his purpose for
[2:04:36] your life
[2:04:37] because anything that serves his purpose
[2:04:40] has a resurrection
[2:04:42] and let's bow our heads and pray lord
[2:04:44] jesus
[2:04:45] i thank you god for your power
[2:04:48] for your resurrection power lord
[2:04:51] i thank you for your love and for the
[2:04:53] work that you do in our lives lord and
[2:04:55] we just want to yield and surrender to
[2:04:57] you
[2:04:58] i pray god that you would forgive us
[2:05:00] lord for childish ideas
[2:05:03] forgive us lord for letting our own
[2:05:04] purpose dictate and guide things lord
[2:05:07] i'm sorry for that
[2:05:08] i'm sorry lord for selfishness and
[2:05:10] self-centeredness lord wash it all out
[2:05:13] of every one of us lord
[2:05:15] help us to come in humility surrendered
[2:05:18] like paul was surrendered like moses was
[2:05:22] surrendered like brother branham was
[2:05:23] till we can come to the place
[2:05:26] we can say it's not me
[2:05:28] but it's you it's christ living in me
[2:05:31] father i pray that you would wash self
[2:05:33] out of us
[2:05:35] may we surrender in a greater way
[2:05:38] and god if there's any of your children
[2:05:40] here that have been
[2:05:42] crushed lord
[2:05:43] that have had wrong notions and wrong
[2:05:46] desires going in the wrong way and
[2:05:48] you've allowed them to slip and to fall
[2:05:50] in the fall flat
[2:05:53] but lord if there's a purpose still
[2:05:54] laying in their lives
[2:05:56] i pray you'd go to them right now
[2:05:59] and that you would resurrect that
[2:06:00] purpose i pray that your spirit would
[2:06:03] begin to brood over that seed that's
[2:06:05] laying in and that you would bring them
[2:06:07] right back to that purpose like you did
[2:06:09] for peter
[2:06:10] you'd call them to be feeders of sheep
[2:06:13] to be fishers of men to be light in the
[2:06:16] darkness
[2:06:18] god we love you
[2:06:19] we know lord that it's your purpose in
[2:06:22] us
[2:06:23] that gives us a reason to be here in
[2:06:25] this end time
[2:06:27] it's your purpose in us that keeps your
[2:06:29] hand upon us
[2:06:31] it's your purpose in us that gives us
[2:06:32] revelation on the word it's your purpose
[2:06:34] in us that gives us ears to hear
[2:06:37] faith to believe
[2:06:39] god let that purpose be manifest in this
[2:06:42] day
[2:06:43] help us not to hold it back put it under
[2:06:45] a bushel hide it behind our purpose but
[2:06:48] help us lord to allow your purpose to
[2:06:50] dictate our lives
[2:06:52] we love you lord i commit these people
[2:06:54] into your hands commit myself in this
[2:06:57] congregation
[2:06:58] let us live for your purpose alone
[2:07:01] let us live a resurrected life by your
[2:07:04] power for your glory for your
[2:07:06] manifestation
[2:07:08] and may you get glory in it all we pray

[2:07:21] desire

[2:07:46] give it all to
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:08:02] me
[2:08:04] [Music]
[2:08:08] could he
[2:08:09] desire
[2:08:11] to have
[2:08:13] fellowship with me
[2:08:17] there must be something more within
[2:08:22] that only
[2:08:25] can see
[2:08:28] i pray dear lord please take my life
[2:08:33] i give it
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:40] and
[2:08:41] granted every day
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:52] if we look and watch through the bible
[2:08:54] god's run this cycle so many times
[2:08:58] he called israel out of egypt to bring
[2:09:00] him to the promised land
[2:09:02] and they were supposed to establish
[2:09:04] his worship and they were supposed to be
[2:09:06] a light and to all nations
[2:09:08] they were supposed to follow his will
[2:09:10] and follow his word and by their
[2:09:12] obedience they were supposed to be the
[2:09:14] illumination of the world
[2:09:17] but they began to serve their own
[2:09:18] purposes
[2:09:20] they began to chase after their own
[2:09:21] desires their own homes their own
[2:09:23] vineyards their own kingdoms
[2:09:26] and when they failed to keep god's word
[2:09:28] and started following after their own
[2:09:30] desire he turned them over to babylon
[2:09:34] they were dead it was a dead nation it
[2:09:36] was finished there was nothing left
[2:09:39] but his purpose wasn't done there was a
[2:09:42] prophecy that i'll bring you back into
[2:09:44] this land i'll bring you back into this
[2:09:47] land because there was still a purpose
[2:09:49] for the nation of israel and though they
[2:09:51] were dead and they had no hope and no
[2:09:53] way of rescuing themselves no hope of
[2:09:55] coming out of babylon the hope was not
[2:09:57] in their power to bring him out of
[2:09:59] babylon the hope lay in his purpose for
[2:10:01] them to bring them back to establish his
[2:10:04] kingdom again
[2:10:06] so in due time without their effort
[2:10:10] without their wisdom without their skill
[2:10:13] brought them out
[2:10:15] to build again his temple
[2:10:17] so that they could be the light to all
[2:10:19] nations that were around
[2:10:21] and when they failed again
[2:10:23] he scattered them
[2:10:25] scattered them to the four winds and
[2:10:27] that's where they are now they're
[2:10:28] gathering back now but the gathering
[2:10:30] back now is for a purpose
[2:10:32] it's for the gathering of the 144
[2:10:34] thousand
[2:10:36] he did this in the church i mean when
[2:10:38] the first church age came out they were
[2:10:40] his they were there to illuminate the
[2:10:42] world they were to be lights in a dark
[2:10:44] world to be the light of god shining in
[2:10:46] this earth amen but they begin to follow
[2:10:49] their own purposes and set up
[2:10:50] denominations and build own church
[2:10:52] kingdoms and church systems
[2:10:55] so he let them get scattered through
[2:10:57] denominations and destroyed through the
[2:10:59] dark ages
[2:11:02] but he still had a purpose in that
[2:11:03] little church
[2:11:05] and he started bringing it back
[2:11:08] and that's why we're here today
[2:11:10] not because what did you do in the dark
[2:11:12] ages to start the reformation
[2:11:14] nothing
[2:11:16] what did you do to start the revival on
[2:11:18] azusa street in 1906 nothing what did
[2:11:20] you do to bring the message
[2:11:22] through the through the 60s nothing
[2:11:26] because he's brought it back to serve
[2:11:28] his purpose
[2:11:29] and we are here to be the illumination
[2:11:32] of the world to be the temple to be the
[2:11:34] dwelling place of god that from this
[2:11:37] nation his nation his kingdom his people
[2:11:40] the light would shine to all nations
[2:11:43] and if we ever miss that purpose in our
[2:11:45] individual lives in our lives as a
[2:11:47] church or in a ministry god will allow
[2:11:50] that to go back through the cycle of
[2:11:52] death
[2:11:53] so he can bring it back to his purpose
[2:11:55] again
[2:11:56] i'm tired of the cycle of death
[2:11:59] i'm tired
[2:12:01] of taking my own purpose and getting it
[2:12:03] crushed
[2:12:04] i just want to take his purpose lord
[2:12:06] let me shine that light
[2:12:08] let me live that word let me forsake all
[2:12:12] my own thoughts and wishes and dreams
[2:12:14] and plans and my thoughts of what's
[2:12:16] right what's wrong let me give it all up
[2:12:18] and just take this word
[2:12:20] and let it shine through this stone
[2:12:23] that's all he's ever wanted
[2:12:25] that's all he's ever wanted a people to
[2:12:28] obey him to be his light to be his
[2:12:30] dwelling place a place where he can
[2:12:32] dwell with his people to shine the light
[2:12:34] to the world
[2:12:35] and that's what he's called you and i to
[2:12:37] be in this day
[2:12:38] that's why there's a resurrection of the
[2:12:40] bride tree and that's why you're here in
[2:12:42] the final stage of the resurrection
[2:12:45] for his purpose
[2:12:47] and i say god i'm determined
[2:12:50] i'm determined with all that's in me
[2:12:52] to surrender to that purpose
[2:12:55] but all that's in me and my flesh and in
[2:12:57] my mind is not enough i need you god to
[2:13:00] come and work your purpose in my life
[2:13:03] i'll surrender everything i can
[2:13:04] surrender but i can't do it all i've got
[2:13:07] to have that life of jesus christ come
[2:13:10] into this temple to take over to shine
[2:13:12] the light
[2:13:14] so i'm surrendering myself afresh this
[2:13:16] morning saying god it's got to be your
[2:13:18] power it's got to be your spirit i can't
[2:13:21] do it if it's left to me we're going to
[2:13:23] fall in the same cycle i'm going to do
[2:13:25] what peter did i'm going to do what
[2:13:26] moses did god i can't be left up to me i
[2:13:29] surrender will you come and live your
[2:13:31] life
[2:13:32] through this tabernacle
[2:13:35] amen god bless you think on those things
[2:13:38] as you're dismissed
[2:13:40] may god just
[2:13:41] put it in our hearts so deep
[2:13:44] that this resurrection
[2:13:46] is for his glory
[2:13:48] and for his purpose and we could sing
[2:13:50] that chorus one more time brother
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:58] could he
[2:13:59] desire
[2:14:01] to have fellowship
[2:14:04] with me
[2:14:07] there must be something more within
[2:14:12] that only he
