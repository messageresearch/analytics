[12:29] amen God bless you if you'd like to turn
[12:31] in your Bibles to first Samuel
[12:33] chapter 16 verse 6.
[12:37] everybody happy to be at church tonight
[12:39] amen
[12:41] thoughts and prayers are with a lot of
[12:43] people that sick I don't think I've seen
[12:45] so many people get sick at one time but
[12:47] that's okay God's still the same
[12:49] yesterday today and forever
[12:51] his word is just as stronger every day
[12:54] you just have to believe it but we're
[12:56] lifting up our brothers and sisters and
[12:58] people picking me up a little bit I'm
[13:01] not feeling the greatest myself I've had
[13:02] a headache all day so just a little
[13:05] attack that's all it is so it's all is
[13:07] well all is well so
[13:10] are you there first Samuel chapter 16
[13:14] verse 6. and it came to pass when they
[13:17] were come that he looked on Iliad and
[13:21] said surely the Lord's anointed is
[13:23] before him but the Lord said unto Samuel
[13:26] look not on his countenance or on the
[13:28] height of his stature because I have
[13:31] refused him for the Lord seeth not as
[13:34] man seeth for man looketh on the outward
[13:37] appearance but the Lord looks upon the
[13:40] heart
[13:41] amen I want to read one more verse in
[13:44] first John chapter 3 verse 1.
[13:51] first John chapter 3 verse 1.
[13:58] says behold what manner of love the
[14:01] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[14:04] should be called the sons of God
[14:07] therefore the world knoweth us not
[14:10] because it knew him not
[14:14] amen may God add His blessings his word
[14:17] you may be seated this evening
[14:21] well God bless you
[14:24] I have a little thought on my heart and
[14:26] I pray that it's uh it's just a little
[14:28] inspiration I even was wrestling with it
[14:31] throughout the day saying Lord It's just
[14:32] seemingly a little too small tonight but
[14:34] I think God knows how to just give us
[14:36] that which we have need of and you never
[14:38] quite know where somebody's at you never
[14:40] quite know where what struggle they're
[14:42] going through you know we have a
[14:44] maturing bride so that means that we're
[14:47] in all levels of maturing in our process
[14:49] of growth and so we we bear with one
[14:52] another right but maybe just maybe we
[14:55] may need some of the mature ones may
[14:57] need to hear this at times as well so I
[14:59] was just uh just meditating on it
[15:01] throughout the day and it encouraged me
[15:03] though it's something I know yet it
[15:05] still encourages me to know uh when God
[15:08] speaks to me this way and so I'd like to
[15:11] bring a little thought to your mind I've
[15:14] titled It In My Father's Eyes
[15:17] In My Father's Eyes and this thought is
[15:21] coming as a result of a conversation
[15:23] that I had with a friend of mine about a
[15:26] month and a half ago
[15:27] I had a and met him in a coffee shop and
[15:30] he's a nice man good friend known him
[15:32] for a long long time began to ask me
[15:35] some questions and wanted to know if I
[15:37] could give his opinion give me his
[15:39] opinion on some of the business that he
[15:41] was running he knew I had owned some
[15:43] businesses and and I said sure and so
[15:46] after a while of talking you know I kind
[15:48] of could tell something was a little bit
[15:49] bothering him and he kept looking out
[15:51] the window and after a while I says you
[15:54] know I called his name and I said hey
[15:56] why are you still doing this
[15:58] and he said you know I've been thinking
[16:00] that for the last week he's about 67
[16:02] years old he said I've been asking
[16:04] myself that for the last week why am I
[16:06] still doing this and he said you know
[16:09] what he said when I was a kid my dad
[16:11] made fun of me he said he always thought
[16:13] I had crazy ideas and I could have never
[16:15] accomplished any of these crazy ideas
[16:17] that I have he said you used to make fun
[16:19] of me all the time in front of my
[16:20] brothers
[16:21] he said he looked out the window he
[16:23] looked out the window and he said he
[16:25] said I guess I'm still just trying to
[16:26] please my dad
[16:28] and I thought my and his dad's dead his
[16:33] dad has been dead for years and here he
[16:35] is still striving through life trying to
[16:37] achieve something trying to find Merit
[16:40] or success or find approval from his
[16:43] natural death and it's still driving him
[16:46] today
[16:47] and then he looked at me says why do you
[16:49] do everything you do I said you framed
[16:51] the question right
[16:52] because the reality of it is we do most
[16:55] the things we do as we see ourselves in
[16:58] the eyes of God
[16:59] Alice better ouster when he spoke here
[17:01] that last time the news here he said as
[17:02] a man thinketh in his heart so is he and
[17:05] we began to realize that Jacob saw
[17:07] himself what he thought he was he
[17:10] manifested but when he got a new name
[17:12] change he could say this isn't the god
[17:14] of my father's this is my God
[17:16] and everything changed for him when he
[17:18] recognized his position in his father's
[17:21] eyes in the eyes of God it changed and
[17:24] so I would like to just continue in this
[17:26] thought because it's been kind of a
[17:28] moving thing for me because I realized
[17:30] that you know who we are it cannot be
[17:33] identified
[17:34] um by our brethren
[17:36] who we are cannot be identified by the
[17:38] church who we are must only come from
[17:40] God our Father
[17:42] you are not something because the pastor
[17:44] tells you something you're not something
[17:46] because your mother and your father tell
[17:48] you or something you're not something
[17:49] because the brothers and sisters that we
[17:51] fellowship with on a weekly basis tell
[17:53] you or something you are only what you
[17:55] know you are when your father declares
[17:58] to you who you are and I'd like to take
[18:00] that through the Bible because I find
[18:02] the same thing took place in Jesus's
[18:04] life took place in brother branham's
[18:05] life
[18:06] and it continues to be something that we
[18:08] have to come to our own conclusion in
[18:10] and I remember the first time that I had
[18:12] had my uh Ellie air Cali when she was
[18:15] first born I I had we had her at the
[18:17] hospital and they cleaned her up you
[18:18] know cleaned all the blood off of her
[18:19] and everything and I began to they'd let
[18:22] me come over and look at her and I'm
[18:23] looking at her and I'm looking at this
[18:24] little baby this little life and she was
[18:27] perfect she was all clean and she's cute
[18:29] and then I got down her close and I
[18:31] looked at her in the eyes and instantly
[18:33] you know that fatherly like something
[18:35] that I never understood what it was it's
[18:37] like oh wow this thing right here came
[18:40] from me and this thing that I'm looking
[18:42] at for the first time I would die for in
[18:44] a heartbeat I would do whatever it takes
[18:46] to protect and provide for this little
[18:48] thing though I just met you and it's
[18:51] just something that struck me and then
[18:53] it was after I began to look at her and
[18:55] hold my own daughter that it really put
[18:57] me into a desperation to find where did
[18:59] I come from and if you all remember it
[19:01] was about three months later I showed up
[19:03] in this church
[19:04] and uh because it created a desperation
[19:06] I knew that I had a little daughter that
[19:11] would be looking one of these days for
[19:12] the truth she'd have to know where she
[19:14] came from not in this natural life but
[19:16] in a spiritual journey and so and I
[19:19] didn't know where I came from so I
[19:21] needed I got desperate for God and when
[19:24] I got desperate for God he led me to
[19:25] this church and though I went through a
[19:27] few struggles and we all went through a
[19:29] little bumps in the road and a lot of
[19:32] things changed over the years I was
[19:34] still hearing the voice of my father
[19:35] declare who I was it was identifying me
[19:38] and it changed the way I talked it
[19:40] changed the way I walked it changed the
[19:41] way I viewed things it changed
[19:43] everything in my life and I think it
[19:45] changed everything in yours because we
[19:47] come into this world with a natural
[19:50] um perception of who we are and usually
[19:52] that for for a boy I would imagine is
[19:54] for a girl it comes a lot from your
[19:56] father your natural father how he views
[19:58] you how what he thinks of you it
[20:00] determines a lot of how you act in life
[20:03] and if I look back in my own natural
[20:05] birth with my own natural father I have
[20:07] a wonderful father I have a wonderful
[20:08] mother but they could not uh there was a
[20:11] lot of bad in me still too in my natural
[20:13] first birth there was nothing much to be
[20:16] proud of but I'll tell you one thing
[20:18] that I can find tremendous uh a
[20:20] tremendous amount of words of
[20:21] congratulations or thanks for and that's
[20:23] in my second birth when I recognized I
[20:25] had a father that was in heaven and I
[20:28] can brag on him all day long and it
[20:30] changed my walk it changed my
[20:32] perspective it changed everything in my
[20:34] life when I began to view my life
[20:36] through his eyes and not my own and not
[20:38] the people around me
[20:40] and far too often I find you know the
[20:42] world is in complete chaos they don't
[20:43] know if they're male they're female they
[20:45] don't know what they are from day to day
[20:47] they change they're in complete chaos
[20:49] and I was looking at some stats of a
[20:50] father and homes that have no father and
[20:53] it shocks you you should look at it the
[20:55] statistics of a home with the children
[20:57] that have no father an absentee father I
[20:59] believe it's like 65 percent of teen
[21:02] suicides come from a home without a
[21:04] father
[21:05] 93 of girls born in a home without a
[21:09] father will have a teenage pregnancy
[21:11] 92 percent of them will divorce in life
[21:14] uh 163 percent increase in having a baby
[21:20] before marriage I mean when you look at
[21:22] the lack of a father giving a home its
[21:24] identity and its children's identity all
[21:26] you see is chaos
[21:28] because that's the reality of it a
[21:30] father that can identify for his
[21:31] children who they are in their home who
[21:33] we are in God who we who this family and
[21:35] what this family is on Earth for and
[21:37] show at its direct purpose it goes into
[21:39] complete chaos and that's what we're
[21:41] seeing in the world around us but that's
[21:43] not so for us
[21:45] amen with this message came down and it
[21:47] was my father declaring I'm here to
[21:49] redeem my children I'm making my net
[21:51] self known to you and as I have
[21:53] identified myself and unveil myself I
[21:56] will unveil you at the exact same time
[21:58] you recognize that in the Bible that
[22:00] every time that God was identified as
[22:03] this is the word made flesh the word
[22:06] made flesh then identified them this is
[22:09] a daughter of Abraham she recognized me
[22:11] or those that could not recognize the
[22:13] word may flesh then he says when they
[22:15] say you do these things by Beyonce he
[22:17] said you are of your father the devil
[22:18] and his works you do do you recognize
[22:20] when the unveiling of God was unveiled
[22:22] before them those that could recognize
[22:24] this is the word made flesh he
[22:26] identified them as part of the same word
[22:27] and those that rejected this as the word
[22:30] made flesh he identified them as from
[22:32] their father the devil you see so you
[22:35] cannot peel back the unveil God unless
[22:38] you're going to unveil his children we
[22:40] are a part of this there is no
[22:42] separating us from this great mystery
[22:44] the seventh Angel's message was this
[22:46] that the mystery of God would be made
[22:49] known and this is the mystery of God
[22:52] being made known I look at at it every
[22:55] day we're being molded in shaped and
[22:57] expressing the very portion of the word
[22:59] that we've come here to fulfill
[23:01] so I'd like to just read some things if
[23:03] that's okay because I'm
[23:05] and I'll also say this that's one thing
[23:07] with the youth I never want to do and I
[23:08] always try not to do because I've seen a
[23:10] fallacy in this I find that there's an
[23:12] insecurity amongst many people that they
[23:15] always have to be a part of a group you
[23:16] ever notice this in the natural world
[23:18] you find there's groups everywhere they
[23:20] have to find okay I'm into this so I
[23:22] identify with this or I'm into this and
[23:24] identify with this but then that's one
[23:26] thing for the world but when the church
[23:27] has to get groups and we have to
[23:30] assemble ourselves and unite ourselves
[23:31] with a group so that we can feel secure
[23:33] there's something wrong I should not
[23:35] need to have a group around me to feel
[23:37] secure in my walk with the Lord I should
[23:39] not have to have the approval of my
[23:40] brother to know who I am in God I should
[23:43] be able to see through his eyes and know
[23:44] who I am in God and that's with my own
[23:47] daughter and my in even in the youth I
[23:49] don't tell them who they are I tell them
[23:51] what God says the elect of God are but
[23:53] God himself has to identify them I
[23:55] cannot do that the pastor brother Chad I
[23:58] don't care who stands here he can't tell
[24:00] you who you are he can tell you what the
[24:01] word says but you yourself have to hear
[24:04] from God himself that's who I I am until
[24:07] then you're just you're just a parrot
[24:09] you're just repeating what's been told
[24:10] you but it's not a rock of Revelation
[24:12] you can stand on and it will be tested
[24:14] and it will be tried but when God tells
[24:17] you who you are what can come against
[24:19] that that's what we want to hear I want
[24:22] to hear my father's voice say Kyle you
[24:25] are bone of my bone the Flesh of My
[24:27] Flesh life of my life power of my power
[24:29] that's what we want to hear I want to
[24:31] see what my father says about me
[24:34] and so I'd like to read this in and
[24:36] remember this keep this in mind in the
[24:38] beginning was the word and the Word was
[24:40] with God and the Word was God
[24:44] so my father is the word
[24:46] so if I'm going to be identified my
[24:49] father is going to identify me by the
[24:51] word that's why brother Brandon
[24:53] preachers identified with those Bible
[24:54] characters can you find yourself in the
[24:57] book can you find yourself identified
[24:59] with your father the word
[25:01] if you can't you better get desperate
[25:04] before God which side of this
[25:05] identification are you on
[25:08] so he says in Smyrna Church age he says
[25:10] now then here are we coming to a
[25:12] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[25:16] manifested in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt
[25:19] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[25:21] that Eternal one was the father manifest
[25:24] In the Flesh and thereby gained the
[25:26] title of son even so we Eternal in his
[25:30] thoughts in our turn become the many
[25:35] membered spoken word seed manifested in
[25:39] flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[25:42] manifest In the Flesh of the sons of God
[25:47] that's a big statement right there is to
[25:50] be the fact is I it's my turn he had his
[25:54] turn now it's my turn now I am the word
[25:57] made flesh in this day now you're the
[25:59] word made flesh in this day that's what
[26:01] the word said you are now it's your
[26:03] portion to be fulfilled and I'm
[26:05] identified with that so therefore I walk
[26:07] differently it's my turn you ever say
[26:10] that you're like good job Paul good job
[26:13] Peter good job it's my turn
[26:16] I think there's an attitude in the bride
[26:18] it's like it's my turn you did good you
[26:21] did good Brothers my turn watch out here
[26:23] we go not in in arrogancy but it's a
[26:26] fact that God manifests himself in human
[26:29] beings
[26:31] now he said hold this carefully in mind
[26:33] now take the next step redeem means to
[26:36] buy back it restores to the original
[26:39] owner God by his death and a shed blood
[26:42] brought back his own he brought back the
[26:46] spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my
[26:49] word and they follow me you always were
[26:52] a sheep you never were a pig or a dog
[26:55] turned into a sheep that's impossible
[26:57] for any kind of Life produces the same
[26:59] kind of Life same kind and there is no
[27:02] change in its species as we were in the
[27:04] thoughts of God and then expressed in
[27:07] flesh there had to come a day when we
[27:10] would hear his voice his word and
[27:13] hearing his voice become aware of our
[27:16] father calling us and recognizing that
[27:19] we are the sons of God we heard his
[27:22] voice and we cried out as did The
[27:24] Prodigal Son oh oh Save Me O my father
[27:28] I'm returning to thee oh man I just I'll
[27:32] tell you what that gets me a little bit
[27:33] excited I'm sorry but reality of it was
[27:35] every one of us was groping in darkness
[27:37] until we heard the voice of God in our
[27:39] age and we didn't maybe we didn't
[27:41] realize it at first but this is my
[27:43] father identifying me as a Son of God
[27:46] you as a daughter of God not by
[27:50] association with the right people but by
[27:52] the voice of God that declares Who You
[27:54] Are
[27:55] it changed you walked differently now I
[27:58] want to bring in the little story and
[28:00] you all know this story quite well it's
[28:02] amnesia's story it's the soldier
[28:05] now he says the French soldier I was
[28:07] told and and I again remember there may
[28:09] be some that don't know this there's new
[28:11] in all stages so bear with us okay you
[28:14] bear with me we love one another a
[28:16] French shoulder I was told a little
[28:18] story before we close I didn't know it
[28:20] was this late I got about 10 pages here
[28:22] on these notes notice there was this
[28:24] French soldier they got a bunch of
[28:25] shoulders soldiers in the Army and they
[28:27] all had Amnesia it was from shock on the
[28:29] battle they had a program and they had
[28:32] called up and left left these people who
[28:35] were missing loved ones to call and see
[28:37] if they could identify any of these boys
[28:39] and no hope for them maybe one or two
[28:41] they caught it and then they just took
[28:44] the rest of them they'd put them out in
[28:45] a sanitarium and there they'd stay for
[28:48] the rest of their lives they were going
[28:49] up the hillside uh train was pulling and
[28:52] they stopped at the station let a few
[28:54] boys get out and stretch their legs and
[28:55] the guards got out on the hill and they
[28:57] began to watch him because you know with
[28:59] that Amnesia you have to watch him so
[29:01] they watched this one Young fella and he
[29:04] got out and began to look around at the
[29:06] water tank he looked all over the hill
[29:07] he rubbed his face and he studied it he
[29:09] looked all again and then he seen a
[29:11] water tank he looked all over the
[29:12] station he started walking and then
[29:15] instead of the Guard stopping him he
[29:16] just followed him he went up the hill
[29:18] and down a path and turned to the right
[29:20] and then over another Hill and he'd come
[29:21] to a little cabin he looked and coming
[29:23] out the porch was an old man with a cane
[29:26] in his hand he'd come out and he throwed
[29:28] his arms around him and he said my son I
[29:30] know you would return they told me you
[29:33] were dead but I knowed you would return
[29:34] and the boy came to himself his Amnesia
[29:39] came and left him because he could
[29:41] identify it again who he was he knowed
[29:45] who his father was
[29:47] o soldier of the Cross that's been
[29:49] shocked by so much training so many
[29:52] shocks of denomination and Creeds and
[29:54] the themes of this world why don't you
[29:56] just step off for a few minutes and get
[29:57] to looking in the Bible why don't you
[29:59] wander around a little bit you might
[30:01] find yourself identified here in the
[30:03] word as a Believer one of these days you
[30:07] might not know him you may come to know
[30:09] yourself like the prodigal son and find
[30:11] yourself for your identification is in
[30:14] the word of God
[30:16] amen that's where I was identified I
[30:20] wasn't identified for group Association
[30:22] I was identified when I could find
[30:23] myself in the story of Jacob
[30:26] how many found yourself in the story of
[30:28] Jacob I found myself in the story of
[30:30] Jacob I found myself trying to be a
[30:32] manly or man and make myself more hairy
[30:34] and trying to please everybody around me
[30:36] and be plea be something that I wasn't
[30:38] right you did too you know you found
[30:41] yourself identified there I found myself
[30:44] in the story of David I found myself in
[30:46] these stories I found myself in Abraham
[30:48] I'm not worthy that you should come to
[30:49] me Lord but I had to separate from all
[30:51] my Kindred you found yourself too I
[30:54] found myself there but see I found
[30:56] myself when I began to see myself in the
[30:59] word and my father was identifying me
[31:01] all the way through but you see there's
[31:03] such a Temptation along the way to
[31:05] identify with a group
[31:07] another band name even talks about this
[31:08] he warns about it and we'll get to that
[31:11] now I want you to turn your Bibles to
[31:13] Samuel a little story just take a little
[31:16] bit of a moment to look at this
[31:18] I found it quite entertaining
[31:21] first Samuel 16 we read the portion of
[31:24] it there in the beginning
[31:29] everybody okay with me just taking some
[31:31] time looking at some Bible verses
[31:36] it says in first Samuel 16 6 we read the
[31:38] first portion of it already it said it
[31:40] came to pass they were cut when they
[31:42] were come that he looked upon Iliad and
[31:44] said surely the Lord's anointed is
[31:46] before him but the Lord said unto Samuel
[31:49] look not upon his countenance or on the
[31:51] height of his stature because I have
[31:53] refused him for the Lord seeth not as
[31:56] man seeth from Man looketh on the
[31:58] outward appearance but the Lord looks on
[32:00] the heart then Jesse called Abba dad and
[32:06] made him come to pass before Samuel and
[32:08] he said neither hath the Lord chosen
[32:10] this then Jesse made shama to pass by
[32:14] and he said neither hath the Lord chosen
[32:16] this again Jesse made Seven of his sons
[32:20] to pass before Samuel and Samuel said to
[32:24] unto Jesse the Lord hath not chosen
[32:27] these now think of it the next verse
[32:30] Samuel has to ask Jesse the father
[32:32] Samuel said and Jesse are here all thy
[32:36] children
[32:37] David wasn't even recognized as the son
[32:40] of David or of Jesse the father of David
[32:44] wouldn't even bring him forth and
[32:46] acknowledge Him but remember this is the
[32:48] eighth son
[32:49] the first seven sons were refused it was
[32:52] the eighth son that had the anointing it
[32:55] was the chosen son this was the chosen
[32:59] King the eighth one and through seven
[33:01] Church ages they were all refused
[33:04] because we've come to the bride age this
[33:06] is God's choosing this is the one whom
[33:09] the Lord hath anointed and this is the
[33:11] one whose real father stepped up and
[33:14] identified him God himself because his
[33:17] natural father could not identify David
[33:20] and he said their remaineth yet a
[33:22] youngest behold he keepeth the sheep and
[33:24] Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch
[33:27] for him for we will not sit down till he
[33:30] come hither I like that they can't rest
[33:32] God will not rest there is no rest
[33:35] because his finding his rest in me is
[33:38] where is the place of his dwelling in
[33:40] the place of his rest in The Bride of
[33:41] Jesus Christ
[33:43] the prophet can't rest until the bride
[33:45] comes on the scene
[33:46] and he sent and brought him in and he
[33:49] was ready and with all of a beautiful
[33:51] countenance and goodly to look upon and
[33:54] the Lord said arise anoint him for this
[33:57] is he so he heard the word of his
[34:01] spiritual father and his spiritual
[34:03] father identified him when his natural
[34:06] father couldn't even recognize him
[34:08] couldn't even bring him before the
[34:09] prophet thought well this little fella
[34:11] he's and nothing nobody anyhow I'm so
[34:13] glad to be a part of a group of people
[34:15] that know there are nothing nobody's
[34:16] anyhow it was just a predestinated
[34:18] elected hand of God that brought you
[34:20] forth and anointed you as the eighth
[34:22] bride of Jesus Christ in the Eighth Day
[34:25] in the bride age here you stand
[34:29] so it really doesn't matter what natural
[34:31] perception I have in the eyes of people
[34:34] it matters what God says about me and
[34:36] let's continue to find this because
[34:38] you'll find out when God identified
[34:40] David David begins to identify with God
[34:44] now if you look at Samuel 17 23 we'll
[34:47] slide down to 23.
[34:51] first Samuel 17 23.
[34:53] and the men of Israel said have ye seen
[34:56] this man that has come up surely to defy
[34:59] Israel is he come up and it shall be
[35:02] that the man who killeth him the king
[35:03] will enrich him with great riches and
[35:05] will give him his daughter and make his
[35:07] father Father's House free in Israel and
[35:09] David spake to the men that stood by him
[35:12] saying what shall be done to the man
[35:13] that killeth the Philistine and take
[35:15] away the reproach of Israel for who is
[35:17] this uncircumcised Philistine that he
[35:19] should defy the armies of the Living God
[35:21] and the people answered him with this
[35:24] saying so that it would it will be done
[35:26] to the man that killeth him now look who
[35:28] can't still recognize David
[35:31] and Elliot his eldest brother heard when
[35:35] he spoke unto the men and iliab's anger
[35:38] was kindled against David and he said
[35:40] why cometh thou down hither and with
[35:43] whom hast thou left those few sheep in
[35:46] the wilderness I Know Thy pride and thy
[35:48] naughtiness of thine heart for thou art
[35:50] come down down that thou might to see
[35:53] the battle
[35:55] he's making fun of him here's the eldest
[35:58] brother refusing and jealous of his own
[36:01] youngest brother whom the Lord hath
[36:02] anointed remember he refused eliab and
[36:04] Elliot looked pretty good he was so good
[36:06] looking that the prophet Samuel almost
[36:09] thought this surely has to be the one
[36:11] but God refused him because God wasn't
[36:13] looking out the outside he was looking
[36:15] at Faith on the inside God recognized
[36:18] the heart of Faith he knew where he
[36:20] would find his chosen vessel and he
[36:22] wasn't look on an outward appearance it
[36:25] didn't matter
[36:26] and so then David Dave look at David's
[36:29] response and David said what have I done
[36:31] now what I do Elliot what am I doing the
[36:35] the elect of God is always persecuted
[36:37] because they've the other brothers have
[36:39] been passed up jealousy it's always been
[36:42] jealousy they're jealous of the
[36:44] anointing of the Lord upon Little David
[36:46] a little nobody but the anointing of the
[36:48] Lord was upon him and his brothers
[36:50] refused him couldn't recognize it and
[36:52] made fun of him all the way
[36:54] but it didn't phase David
[36:56] David wasn't like oh yeah okay yep
[36:59] Elliot yep I'm naughty I'm nothing I
[37:01] know it I I'll go home no he said
[37:03] where's that unfilled uncircumcised
[37:05] Philistine get out of my way the
[37:07] anointing the Lord's upon me and I'm
[37:08] gonna cut off his head
[37:09] this is the attitude of the elect of God
[37:12] when the anointing the Lord's upon him
[37:14] he's bold with the word when it comes to
[37:16] the word of God he's as bold as a lion
[37:18] don't cross him in that red you can call
[37:20] him a ready fella nothing no good yeah
[37:22] he'll agree yeah outwardly I'm nothing
[37:24] but on the inside I take a hold of that
[37:26] word of God with everything in me I
[37:28] believe it
[37:29] see God's looking on the inside now
[37:31] let's slide down and you'll see the
[37:33] attitude of David
[37:34] and you'll find out he's so much not
[37:36] like his brothers
[37:38] and David said in verse 45
[37:40] and then said David to his Philistines
[37:42] thou cometh to me with a sword and with
[37:45] a spear and with a shield but I come to
[37:47] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[37:49] and the god of the armies of Israel whom
[37:52] thou Hast defied and this day will the
[37:55] Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I
[37:57] will smite thee and I will take thy head
[37:58] from thee and I will give it give the
[38:01] carcasses of the host to the Philistines
[38:03] this day unto the fowls of the air and
[38:05] to the wild beasts of the earth and to
[38:07] all the Earth may know that there is a
[38:09] God in Israel and all this assembly
[38:12] shall know that the Lord saveth not with
[38:14] a sword or with the spear for the battle
[38:16] is the Lord's and he will give you into
[38:19] our hands do you think that when David
[38:23] was identified by Samuel and anointed
[38:25] that he believed him
[38:27] he sure did because this wasn't talking
[38:30] that none of the other sons of Jesse
[38:32] could talk like this man and I had I had
[38:35] talked to the kids this last couple
[38:36] weeks because I realized the RSA that
[38:39] the the attitude of your tongue changes
[38:41] when you mature as a son did you notice
[38:44] that when David you look at all the
[38:47] Bible characters as they began to mature
[38:50] in the Lord and God begins to deal with
[38:52] him and they begin to be anointed and
[38:54] fulfilled the word they talk differently
[38:55] they act differently they don't talk
[38:58] like a child anymore they talk like a
[39:00] full-grown adult they when I was a child
[39:02] I thought as a child I I I spoke as a
[39:05] child but when I became a man I put
[39:07] aside these childish thoughts and I
[39:09] started talking like a man I started
[39:11] talking like God would talk I started
[39:13] talking like the word would say a thing
[39:14] you notice that so there's a maturing to
[39:17] the tongue when there's a maturing of
[39:19] the vessel the best way to know the
[39:22] maturity of the individual is watch what
[39:24] they talk about
[39:26] for out of the abundance of the heart
[39:27] the mouth speaks
[39:30] so watch what you say the power of life
[39:33] and death is there so if you're maturing
[39:35] as the Son of God you'll start to be
[39:37] able to notice it there'll be a little
[39:38] signal watch what you talk about see
[39:40] what you say about one another see if we
[39:42] can recognize God in the body of his
[39:44] Believers we're all make mistakes news
[39:47] flash you're not a perfect people
[39:50] quotation marks brother banham we are
[39:54] not a perfect people we make big
[39:57] mistakes
[39:58] but when we do we recognize them we
[40:01] confess them and we keep get up and we
[40:03] keep going by The Vamps
[40:05] okay we make mistakes but we get up we
[40:08] keep going we encourage one another
[40:09] let's go Brother come on let's go let's
[40:12] talk like a brother let's talk like the
[40:13] son of God and so
[40:16] uh let's just keep going here now
[40:18] dropping down some more into first
[40:20] Samuel 17 54.
[40:22] now we recognize David's not talking
[40:24] like the son of Jesse David's talking
[40:26] like a Son of God now David in verse 54
[40:30] David took the head of the Philistine
[40:32] and brought it to Jerusalem but he put
[40:35] his armor in his tent and when Saul saw
[40:38] David go forth against the Philistine he
[40:41] said over to Abner the captain of the
[40:43] host Abner whose son is this youth and
[40:47] Abner said as thy Soul liveth King I
[40:50] don't know you just imagine it's always
[40:53] like where'd this fella come from I mean
[40:55] who who's his daddy I have no idea
[40:58] because we've never seen anything like
[41:00] this guys this is a strange individual
[41:02] it's just come it's comical I mean he
[41:04] really you think about it I I thought it
[41:06] was entertaining myself I could just see
[41:08] them it's like where'd this fella come
[41:10] from you know we got to identify as
[41:12] father and when they go to identify his
[41:14] father he says uh they said the king
[41:16] said hey go inquire of whose son is this
[41:19] young man stripping this young man and
[41:21] David returned the slaughter of Israel
[41:22] Philistine Abner took him brought him to
[41:25] Saul
[41:25] with the head of the Philistine in his
[41:27] hand and Saul said unto him who's on Art
[41:30] Thou this thou young man David answered
[41:33] I'm a son of the servant Jesse of
[41:35] Bethany height
[41:36] so there was a great mystery that was
[41:38] being unfolded because this guy wasn't
[41:40] acting wasn't talking wasn't doing
[41:42] anything like the other seven sons of
[41:44] Jesse this son this eighth son this
[41:48] anointed one taught totally different
[41:51] and he backed up his words with action I
[41:54] mean this is a unique situation so see
[41:58] how Revelation and the word of God
[42:00] spoken over your life changes you yeah
[42:03] it changes the way you talk change is
[42:06] where you go changes your attitude
[42:08] changes how you view obstacles in life
[42:10] you don't say oh whoa it's me you say
[42:12] okay where's the where's the where's
[42:14] that Philistine well let me get my sword
[42:15] real quick hold on you see it ought to
[42:18] change the way we act in life
[42:21] still okay
[42:22] you're too quiet it's too quiet it's
[42:24] okay
[42:25] so now I want you to look at something
[42:28] now in the uh life of Jesus
[42:31] there was a problem we recognized in the
[42:34] life of Jesus and it was in the ability
[42:36] of the his mother Mary unable to
[42:39] properly identify him because your
[42:41] identity won't come from the church
[42:42] identity comes from the word you
[42:45] remember a few weeks ago brother Chad
[42:46] and he nailed it and so I apologize
[42:48] almost everything that I wanted to say
[42:50] has been preached in the last six seven
[42:52] term sermons it gets to the point you're
[42:54] like what am I going to say anymore and
[42:56] so brother Chad had said we are not
[42:58] bcfans remember the statement and I sat
[43:01] there I'm like man now I can't even
[43:02] preach on that dude you already said
[43:04] that too but the reality of it is there
[43:06] is an insecurity in people by Nature
[43:09] you're two-thirds the devil to begin
[43:11] with let me just identify something for
[43:13] you you're two-thirds the devil you have
[43:15] insecurities in you you have scars you
[43:18] have little complexes you were born with
[43:20] and I'll tell you what you're going to
[43:21] try to do your old carnal flesh and
[43:23] nature is going to try to find security
[43:25] in somebody
[43:27] some group some church some Doctrine
[43:30] some Creed some some philosophy
[43:32] something
[43:34] it's your human nature to do that but
[43:36] the soul of a sea Gene of God says I can
[43:39] only be comforted and wrapped in his
[43:41] word that's the only thing that I can
[43:43] find security in is what my father said
[43:45] about me that's my place of security my
[43:48] security isn't being identified as a
[43:50] bcfid
[43:52] my security comes from I've identified
[43:54] myself in the word of God amen he spoke
[43:57] to me and I find myself in the pages of
[43:59] the book
[44:00] and so we look at this in Luke chapters
[44:03] 2
[44:04] that Mary
[44:07] it says in Luke 2 46. and it came to
[44:11] pass that after three days they found
[44:13] him in the temple sitting in the midst
[44:14] of the doctors both hearing them and
[44:17] asking them questions and all that heard
[44:19] him were astonished at his understanding
[44:22] and his answers and when they saw him
[44:25] they were amazed and his mother said
[44:27] unto him son why hast thou
[44:31] why hast thou thus dealt with us Behold
[44:35] thy father and I have sought thee sorrow
[44:38] and he said unto them how is it that
[44:40] thou has sought me whis thee not that I
[44:42] must be about my father's business
[44:44] see the word correcting the air
[44:47] she misidentified him
[44:49] she he was not the son of Joseph he was
[44:52] the son of God and he was doing what he
[44:54] was supposed to be doing he was about
[44:55] his father's business now brother
[44:58] Branham brings this up in Shalom and
[44:59] it's very interesting he says now as a
[45:01] 12 year old boy he said I'm about my
[45:04] father's business he rebuked her that's
[45:07] that isn't my father see the church
[45:10] today is carried about with counsels and
[45:13] all kinds of the things of the world
[45:15] she's been blacked out and God is
[45:17] rebuking her never did Jesus ever call
[45:20] her mother one day she came to visit him
[45:23] at the meetings in the house something
[45:25] like this someone said outside the door
[45:27] there's your mother and your brothers he
[45:30] said who is my mother and who are my
[45:32] brothers who are they
[45:34] looked around at his disciples and said
[45:36] they that do the will of God are my
[45:39] father and my mother and my brother see
[45:42] that's who it is and at the cross when
[45:44] he was dying he looked over at John that
[45:46] young disciple he said behold thy mother
[45:48] woman Behold thy son behold son Behold
[45:52] thy mother
[45:53] see never claimed himself it wasn't her
[45:57] son it was God's son she was just the
[46:00] womb listen this is a house this morning
[46:03] this is not a church the church is in
[46:07] you it's Christ and the spirit of The
[46:10] Mortals that are sitting here we've met
[46:12] together today in Heavenly places it's
[46:15] Christ not in this house this building
[46:17] this church
[46:18] the house is all right it is serving its
[46:21] purpose but it's only used for this
[46:23] meeting place Mary was was the only was
[46:26] only a womb that he had used to come to
[46:29] the Earth
[46:30] to be identified himself amongst the
[46:33] people not the mother of God no more
[46:35] than a house is the Church of God it's
[46:38] just used for that
[46:40] see Mary misidentified him the church
[46:43] will always misidentify you you can't
[46:45] get your identity from the church but
[46:47] your father passed to give you an
[46:48] identity now we continue to look at this
[46:51] now he couldn't even walk being
[46:53] identified by his own family the Bible
[46:55] says in John 3 or 7 3 his Brethren
[46:58] therefore sending him departments and go
[47:01] up into Judea that thy disciples Also
[47:03] may see the works that thou doest for
[47:05] there is no man that doeth anything in
[47:07] secret and he himself seek it to be
[47:09] known openly if thou do these things
[47:12] show thyself to the world for neither
[47:14] did his Brethren believe in him
[47:17] so Jesus wasn't walking through the
[47:19] world with his mom correctly identifying
[47:21] him his brothers couldn't correctly
[47:23] identified with him who he was growing
[47:25] up with and spending every day with they
[47:26] couldn't recognize who he was so he
[47:28] couldn't walk with their identification
[47:30] even the Devil Couldn't identify him he
[47:33] said if thou be the Son of God turn
[47:36] these stones into bricks or into bread
[47:38] right if thou being if thou be a son and
[47:41] he kept identifying himself with the one
[47:43] who identified him the word it is
[47:46] written see the word identifies the word
[47:49] and vice versa the word identifies the
[47:52] word and the word identifies the word
[47:54] it's a very unique thought
[47:56] so then he begins to only identify with
[47:59] the thing that identified him the word
[48:02] see it didn't matter
[48:04] it didn't matter who recognized who he
[48:06] was it only recognized that he himself
[48:09] knew who he was
[48:10] you know that brother bam said he knew
[48:12] who he was
[48:14] Jesus in Matthew 26 or Matthew 3 16 it
[48:17] says when Jesus was baptized straight
[48:19] way up out of water Lo the heavens were
[48:21] open unto him and he saw the spirit of
[48:23] God descending like the dove
[48:24] enlightening upon him and lo a voice
[48:26] from Heaven saying this is my beloved
[48:29] Son in whom I'm well pleased
[48:32] so his father the word identified him
[48:36] so Jesus knowing who he was
[48:39] because I'm bringing this to you you
[48:40] know that right that's the obvious
[48:42] course of action
[48:44] 1965 the Easter seal so Jesus so full of
[48:48] the quickening power said if you can
[48:49] destroy this Temple that took you 40
[48:51] years you thought to build I'll raise it
[48:54] up in three days
[48:55] why how could Jesus say that want to ask
[48:59] you why could Jesus say a thing like
[49:01] that he knew who he was I wish I could
[49:05] make that stick he knew who he was he
[49:08] knew that every word that God had wrote
[49:11] in there of him he had fulfilled it and
[49:15] he knew that he was the one that David
[49:17] spoke of
[49:19] do you know you're the ones the Bible
[49:21] speaks of do you know your position in
[49:25] Christ if you're in Christ you're a new
[49:27] creature do you know this word is just
[49:30] like everyday living for you why sure
[49:33] it's yours you're an eagle that's your
[49:36] food
[49:37] we shouldn't be shocked by that
[49:39] we should say absolutely that's exactly
[49:42] right this word is just everyday living
[49:43] for me the manifestation of God in my
[49:46] life it's just everyday Living For Me
[49:47] God's speaking to me through a brother
[49:49] when we have coffee in the coming and
[49:51] same thing when we have church that
[49:52] night through the pastor that's just
[49:53] everyday living for me you see he's the
[49:55] same yesterday today and forever and
[49:57] he's with me wherever I go because
[49:58] wherever I go he's with me I'm dwell
[50:01] he's the I'm the dwelling place of
[50:03] almighty God it should be just common
[50:05] everyday living for us to see that he's
[50:07] the same yesterday today and forever in
[50:09] our lives
[50:10] why do we stumble at that sometimes why
[50:13] are we critical of that we should be the
[50:15] happiest people in this world we should
[50:17] have most confidence and most security
[50:19] of anybody that has ever walked this
[50:22] Earth You know through seven Church ages
[50:23] they couldn't have this kind of security
[50:26] but this the last age this bride has a
[50:29] security that no other age had had
[50:31] nobody exactly knew who they were a
[50:34] mighty Angel comes down breaks the Seven
[50:36] Seals opens the book shows you exactly
[50:39] who he where he's been and what he's
[50:41] been doing identifies this group as the
[50:43] false Church identifies this group as
[50:45] the Bride of Jesus Christ identifies
[50:47] this identifies this identifies this
[50:49] identifies this you see when he's
[50:51] unveiled he's identifying everybody else
[50:53] when you identify the word he identifies
[50:55] you that's just the way it goes you
[50:58] recognize him he'll recognize you
[51:00] and so that's what's happening in this
[51:01] day
[51:02] and it's bringing a proper identity
[51:06] so Christ is the mystery of God
[51:08] still okay
[51:09] I'll go faster I'm sorry I'll go faster
[51:12] so in the Easter seal
[51:15] oh sorry in Christ The Mystery of God
[51:17] now notice God's making himself no not
[51:21] we're all we're not supposed to make
[51:22] converts through Christianity through
[51:24] governments no it's by Revelation that
[51:25] Christ is in you and God was in Christ
[51:28] as God was in Christ Christ is in you
[51:30] and what God did in Christ Christ now
[51:33] does in you what signs did God in Christ
[51:36] do Christ does he does now in you oh
[51:39] isn't that so beautiful I like that
[51:41] Jesus said at that day and that is this
[51:44] day the revelation will be named known
[51:46] you will know that I am in the father
[51:49] and the father is in me and I am in you
[51:53] and you are in me when the Revelation is
[51:56] made manifest that's flesh
[51:58] at that day you shall know that I am in
[52:01] the Father the father and I are one and
[52:03] I am in the father and the father is in
[52:05] me then when the Revelation comes forth
[52:08] It's I and you and you in me there you
[52:12] are see the manifold the threefold
[52:13] manifestation it will bring it back
[52:16] everything's great when we just talk
[52:18] about certain things but when I began to
[52:20] say you know your God to this world
[52:22] when you recognize that the dwelling
[52:25] place of God is you and all you can see
[52:27] is all your mistakes here's the problem
[52:28] we can recognize God in that brother and
[52:31] in that sister and I can see God in that
[52:33] one and I can see God in that one but
[52:36] it's really hard to see the god that
[52:37] looks at me in the mirror that's a
[52:39] really one it's hard to recognize him
[52:42] face to face you look at that one and
[52:44] all you see is your mistakes all you see
[52:46] is what you've been identified through a
[52:48] natural birth with all your failures and
[52:50] your insecurities and all your mistakes
[52:52] that's what you see and that's what's
[52:54] really hard to recognize but you will
[52:56] have to recognize it a certain day when
[52:58] the mystery of the revelation of God is
[53:00] totally unveiled the mystery of God's
[53:02] unveiled you'll find out that I am in
[53:04] the father and the father is in me
[53:06] and then it's not so hard to believe
[53:08] that we talk the way we do we act the
[53:10] way we do and we look at the obstacles
[53:13] in life the way we do but it's hard to
[53:15] recognize it in ourselves
[53:17] so Christ The Mystery of God he says now
[53:20] see
[53:21] it goes right over them and they won't
[53:23] recognize it until it's gone but it will
[53:26] pick up a predestinated seed God's
[53:28] predestinated from before the foundation
[53:29] Rule and the same thing come through in
[53:31] the days of Noah the same thing came
[53:33] through in the days of Moses same in the
[53:35] Days of Elijah and in the prophets and
[53:37] in the days of Jesus now on down through
[53:40] to this very hour the pregnated person
[53:42] with the seed of God the word in there
[53:44] it's manifesting itself so surrendered
[53:47] to the will of God or to the will of God
[53:49] that the word and the word alone will
[53:51] manifest in the person The Prisoner the
[53:54] individual they'll not say my church no
[53:56] the church has nothing to do with it see
[53:59] it's individual the one person and all
[54:01] hell is against that teaching all hell
[54:04] is against that truth but that is the
[54:07] truth see Jesus never said now Peter you
[54:09] and John and all the rest of you people
[54:11] see you all got the Revelation see now
[54:13] the whole church is safe no it was to
[54:16] him personally I say unto thee not them
[54:19] thee Thou Art p leader and Upon This
[54:22] Rock I'll build my church and the word
[54:24] Peter means a little Stone a confessed
[54:27] one or a separated one see so praise God
[54:30] I love coming to church with you I sure
[54:33] do and I appreciate your lives and I
[54:35] appreciate everything you've done but
[54:36] your view of me does not dictate whether
[54:38] or not I'm going to serve God
[54:41] because Jesus wasn't recognized by his
[54:43] Brethren his mother couldn't identify
[54:45] him properly the Devil Couldn't exactly
[54:47] figure him out either but he knew who he
[54:50] was because God had identified him as a
[54:52] Son of God and he found himself in the
[54:54] pages of the book and he acted like it
[54:56] talk like it and live like it he knew
[54:59] who he was and what portion of the word
[55:01] he was on this Earth to fulfill it was
[55:04] his turn now it's mine you see it's not
[55:08] about just going to church it's not
[55:09] about just hey that was a good sermon no
[55:11] I gotta unveil me this word this message
[55:15] has to peel back the mystery of my life
[55:17] so I can find myself in the mystery when
[55:20] the mighty angel came down with an open
[55:21] book and it was signified as a cloud
[55:23] over there in Arizona and remember what
[55:26] happened brother Brandon was caught up
[55:27] into the mystery when he saw the head of
[55:30] God now when seeing the head of Christ
[55:32] brother banham saw one kind of
[55:34] interesting to him one that little that
[55:36] one there to the right of him boy that
[55:38] one seemed a little something to me who
[55:39] was it the seventh angel so he was a
[55:42] part of the mystery and so now the part
[55:44] of Christ the bride she's got to be
[55:46] unveiled I'm part of the mystery you're
[55:48] part of the mystery see but it does not
[55:51] matter the obstacles around us are what
[55:53] people will think of us don't be
[55:55] distracted by that that has nothing to
[55:57] do with it what God said about you that
[55:59] has everything to do with it yeah that
[56:01] has everything to do with it
[56:02] and so as we continue on
[56:05] spiritual amnesia
[56:07] you see what happened they just couldn't
[56:09] identify themselves with the word no
[56:11] more see she doesn't know whether she is
[56:13] a church or a lodge or she doesn't know
[56:15] whether she's a lodge or she's just a
[56:17] church she doesn't want to be called a
[56:19] lodge and she certainly can't be called
[56:20] the church because to be called a church
[56:22] she'd have to identify herself with
[56:24] Christ and that give that gives her a
[56:26] spiritual Amnesia she doesn't want to be
[56:28] called a lodge so it ain't the
[56:29] Pentecostal Church the Methodist Church
[56:31] or the Baptist Church it's the
[56:32] Pentecostal Lodge Methodist Lodge and
[56:34] the Baptist Lodge see because she can't
[56:37] be identified with the word and when the
[56:40] word is made manifest flesh they still
[56:43] don't believe it it's a disease it's a
[56:46] spiritual Amnesia people can't identify
[56:49] themselves they don't know where they
[56:52] belong that's right it's just exactly
[56:55] like high breeding something I've often
[56:57] said one of the dumbest things I ever
[56:59] seen was a mule he's a hybrid his
[57:01] mother's a mayor and his daddy's a
[57:03] donkey and he don't even know where he
[57:05] belongs and the first thing you know you
[57:07] breed him back and you and you get a
[57:09] donkey and then or you get a meal and
[57:11] the mule can't breed itself back so he
[57:13] don't he just you can't teach him
[57:15] nothing he's hard-headed you'll never to
[57:18] be able to tell him anything you can sit
[57:20] there he can sit there with his big old
[57:22] long ears and wait till the longest day
[57:24] of his life just before he dies and kick
[57:26] you that's a that's a rotten donkey
[57:29] that's all he's always waiting for
[57:32] something to bust it in on you
[57:34] now that's a hybridized
[57:37] Christian
[57:38] always hard-headed can't teach him
[57:41] nothing won't humble himself to the word
[57:43] stubbornism you can't accept the word of
[57:46] God or what word of God tells him about
[57:48] him just looking to bust it out on
[57:50] somebody else let me get my hands on
[57:52] somebody I'll bust him a real good one
[57:55] when I get a chance sounds like a hybrid
[57:57] Christian that don't sound like a son
[57:59] and daughter of God does it see a son
[58:02] and daughter like then brother bam goes
[58:03] in talking do I have it I don't know if
[58:05] I have it starts talking about that
[58:06] thoroughbred horse he said oh he's
[58:08] gentle oh my you can teach him you can
[58:10] train him my he knows who his mama is he
[58:13] knows who his papa is he knows who his
[58:15] Grand papa is he can trace his line all
[58:17] the way back he's a thoroughbred horse
[58:19] he said just like a thoroughbred
[58:21] Christian he can trace his lineage all
[58:23] the way back through the Bible back to
[58:25] God he's his gentle calm you can teach
[58:28] him training he knows who he is
[58:31] that's the identification I want I know
[58:34] who I can I know who I am I'm trainable
[58:37] I'm moldable unbreakable if I need to be
[58:39] so the seed is not air with the shut
[58:41] it's okay
[58:42] all right I know it's Wednesday night
[58:44] I'll wrap it up
[58:45] but when you come to say now this is the
[58:47] kicker
[58:48] uh now when you come to say I and my
[58:51] father are one and these other things
[58:54] then the shock pulls away from it but
[58:57] the real genuine bride church will bring
[58:59] forth the entire word of God in its
[59:02] fullness and in its strength for he's
[59:05] the same yesterday today and forever
[59:07] notice the womb of Mary was the seed in
[59:10] the womb of Mary was the sea but when
[59:12] the seed was delivered it said I have
[59:14] come to do the will of him that sent me
[59:16] I and my father are one if I do not his
[59:19] Works believe me not there was the sea
[59:22] which one of you condemn me for unbelief
[59:24] and what what part of the Bible has been
[59:26] promised that I do that I haven't done
[59:28] God has verified it through me he said
[59:30] who can tell me but see the seed in Mary
[59:34] the shuck it was close to being that but
[59:37] it wasn't it was still in the womb
[59:40] notice at the Pentecostal age through
[59:42] the Lutheran age and through the
[59:44] Wesleyan age it's been the same thing
[59:45] all the way through to this Pentecostal
[59:48] age now know notice but the opening of
[59:50] The Seven Seals in Revelations 10 and
[59:52] the full word being born into a
[59:54] manifestation again and it was
[59:57] Vindicated by the spirit of God in its
[59:59] full strength here upon the Earth
[1:00:01] manifested here in the same way it's
[1:00:03] doing the same things here on Earth you
[1:00:06] see it it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:00:08] yesterday today and forever do you see
[1:00:11] it
[1:00:12] that's my question have you seen it
[1:00:15] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:00:17] and forever fully manifested manifested
[1:00:21] is to be made flesh God veiled in human
[1:00:25] flesh again Discerning the thoughts and
[1:00:27] the intents of your own heart
[1:00:30] I had a conversation with a brother a
[1:00:32] while ago about a month ago when brother
[1:00:33] Jean Kadima and I told him in my heart
[1:00:35] it's burning I says it's like I just
[1:00:37] Abba Father Abba Father I want to preach
[1:00:40] on it and then we got to talk and we
[1:00:41] talked for an hour almost an entire hour
[1:00:43] and just sharing what what was stirring
[1:00:46] in my heart brother John Kadima comes up
[1:00:48] that night and this opening scripture is
[1:00:50] Galatians 4 and Abba Father and he
[1:00:52] preaches everything we talk about that
[1:00:55] morning
[1:00:56] who is this in our midst
[1:00:58] is what is going on do you notice it's
[1:01:00] not a public show do you notice how calm
[1:01:03] and quiet these things are do you notice
[1:01:05] there's not a lot of screaming and
[1:01:06] shouting in the public running in to see
[1:01:08] something but it's still Jesus Christ
[1:01:10] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:01:12] Discerning and identifying what you're
[1:01:14] talking about in your home what you have
[1:01:16] a cup of coffee with a brother over here
[1:01:18] on this side who is this in our midst
[1:01:20] but see it's just as calm and settled as
[1:01:23] can be
[1:01:24] will the bride have a great ministry yes
[1:01:26] but it'll be so humble it'll be so
[1:01:28] humble people won't even realize it it
[1:01:31] won't be screaming and shouting in the
[1:01:33] public coming from all places to see a
[1:01:35] skeptical or spectacle no you know after
[1:01:39] the resurrection when Jesus came back on
[1:01:41] the scene he went to people privately
[1:01:44] if what a resurrection that was what a
[1:01:46] resurrection this is where God himself
[1:01:48] is individually coming to you meeting
[1:01:51] you when you're discouraged out like
[1:01:53] Peter fishing by the seashore he comes
[1:01:55] to you in your place of discouragement
[1:01:57] and begins to talk to you and you read
[1:01:58] this in the Bible and then the brother
[1:02:00] says this to you when you call him and
[1:02:01] then the minister preaches on the same
[1:02:02] thing that you have need of that day
[1:02:04] who is this is this the Mighty God
[1:02:07] unveil it is the Mighty God unveil he's
[1:02:10] here he's doing the same things that he
[1:02:12] did then doesn't that declare him to be
[1:02:14] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:18] he is he's here but see how quiet and
[1:02:21] personal and private it is now
[1:02:23] it's in silence not a lot of screaming
[1:02:26] shouting and Gathering everybody in no
[1:02:28] he's meeting you quietly in the secret
[1:02:31] of your own prayer life of your own
[1:02:33] devotion and walk with him he comes to
[1:02:35] you here he comes to you here it comes
[1:02:37] to you here so shocking now but see so
[1:02:41] humble
[1:02:43] so simple
[1:02:46] um where am I hmm
[1:02:49] okay we'll just jump here because I
[1:02:51] don't know this one looks like a good
[1:02:52] spot now to be a true Christian you have
[1:02:56] to be the same
[1:02:57] you don't want to forget about it I'm
[1:02:59] identified with him I'm identified with
[1:03:01] him notice as he is in me I'm in him
[1:03:04] notice every Christian that's a real
[1:03:07] genuine Christian and uh was with him
[1:03:10] then when the morning Stars sang
[1:03:12] together and the sons of God were
[1:03:14] shouting for Joy there before the
[1:03:16] foundations of the world we were
[1:03:17] identified in the immortal Realms with
[1:03:19] God 10 million years before the world
[1:03:22] was ever formed I was back there with
[1:03:24] him if I've got eternal life I was there
[1:03:27] with him I was identified with him I was
[1:03:31] there when the morning stars were
[1:03:32] singing together and the sons of God
[1:03:33] were shouting for Joy I was with him
[1:03:35] when he called Abraham at the age of 70
[1:03:37] and his wife being 65 and told him they
[1:03:40] were going to have a baby I was with him
[1:03:42] when he took a stand on thus saith the
[1:03:44] Lord I'm going to have this baby have
[1:03:46] you said the same thing I'm old I'm not
[1:03:49] worthy of it but I'm bringing forth this
[1:03:51] word this word's coming forth in me have
[1:03:53] you identified yourself in the same way
[1:03:55] Abraham had did Abraham did Elohim
[1:03:58] turned his back and to discerned the
[1:03:59] thoughts that were in Sarah's heart did
[1:04:01] he discern the thoughts in your heart
[1:04:03] sure he is I'm identified with him this
[1:04:06] is the same thing it's it's our turn
[1:04:08] I stood with him every other Christian
[1:04:10] stood with him I was there when he had
[1:04:12] his Temptations I was with him when he
[1:04:15] was on top of the mountain up there to
[1:04:18] offer Isaac and the ram appeared I was
[1:04:21] with Joseph when he was rejected of his
[1:04:22] Brethren because see he was spiritual
[1:04:24] and all the rest of them was carnal I
[1:04:27] was with him when he knowed the reproach
[1:04:29] he had to stand by his own Brothers what
[1:04:33] he was I am and what I am he was for We
[1:04:36] Are All One in Christ Jesus I was with
[1:04:39] Joseph in his cave in his grave I was
[1:04:42] with him when he was at the right hand
[1:04:44] of pharaoh you have to be identified
[1:04:46] with him I was with Jacob that night
[1:04:49] that he wrestled all night with the
[1:04:51] angel you see I wrestled myself I know
[1:04:54] that what he went through through with
[1:04:57] so I've wrestled it with Jacob the same
[1:04:59] as he did for I am his brother uh
[1:05:04] you have to be it's in the Bible for us
[1:05:07] to do so
[1:05:08] so you see I'm identified you're
[1:05:10] identified I'm wrestling it out with
[1:05:12] Jacob anybody wrestling I've been
[1:05:14] wrestling it out there's some things in
[1:05:16] me I don't like and I need to hear from
[1:05:18] God and God himself has to clearly
[1:05:20] identify me and I may I want to walk
[1:05:22] different from this place on I I want to
[1:05:25] come and I want him to touch me I could
[1:05:27] never walk the same you see there's a
[1:05:29] reason why we're finding ourselves
[1:05:31] identified in these scriptures there's a
[1:05:33] reason why brother Allison when he
[1:05:34] preach and our hearts were burning
[1:05:36] within us as he started picking up the
[1:05:37] stories of the Bible and taking that
[1:05:39] which was in the past and bringing into
[1:05:41] the president because this is the coming
[1:05:42] of the Lord I will visit you according
[1:05:45] to the time of life he told Abraham and
[1:05:47] what happened Sarah brought forth a
[1:05:49] child so who was it God where in the
[1:05:52] woman in the womb of the woman here she
[1:05:54] came so where is God today in his second
[1:05:57] coming in the womb of the woman not the
[1:05:59] womb but that which is in the woman
[1:06:01] this flesh and this shuck it's giving
[1:06:03] way to give birth to the life that's on
[1:06:06] the inside you see what I'm saying
[1:06:08] so we're identified the mystery of God
[1:06:11] is being made known
[1:06:13] now transforming he can Trent he can
[1:06:16] transform us through his word and that
[1:06:19] we can rest upon because we are a part
[1:06:22] of it and now there's many things in my
[1:06:24] natural birth in my natural birth that I
[1:06:27] cannot brag on and I'll tell you I ain't
[1:06:29] got nothing to braggle my mother was a
[1:06:31] sinner to begin with and my father was a
[1:06:33] sinner we're a bunch of Cutthroats and
[1:06:35] gunfighters and most of them died with
[1:06:37] their boots on a bunch of drunks and
[1:06:38] bootleggers and everything else out of
[1:06:40] Kentucky my mother was a half Indian and
[1:06:42] I ain't got nothing to brag on I can't
[1:06:45] brag on any of my family tree
[1:06:47] amen I can identify
[1:06:50] but glory to God there is one thing that
[1:06:53] I can brag on and that's my second birth
[1:06:55] which came from Jesus Christ I can brag
[1:06:58] on that parent he is my father he is my
[1:07:02] savior he is my redeemer I can brag on
[1:07:05] everything that he was for he done it
[1:07:07] for me because now I have become his son
[1:07:10] I am no more a son of Charles Branham
[1:07:13] I'm a son of Jesus Christ that's right I
[1:07:16] can brag on my birth now I can't brag on
[1:07:18] my first there's nothing I'm ashamed of
[1:07:20] that one but I can brag on my second and
[1:07:23] I I and I will brag on my second you see
[1:07:26] I've been washed by the washing of his
[1:07:28] word amen I can brag on my second my
[1:07:31] natural life before the Lord pretty
[1:07:33] rough pretty messed up nothing to brag
[1:07:36] on nothing to look at a mess I'm so glad
[1:07:38] he came to me I heard his voice and I
[1:07:42] came walking I came on a journey with
[1:07:44] him and I'm still on a journey with him
[1:07:45] until one day these atoms change and I'm
[1:07:47] out of here I'm out of here I'm going to
[1:07:49] keep on walking this journey remember
[1:07:51] Enoch had three stages of his journey
[1:07:53] you ever think of that he picked up at
[1:07:55] the birth of Methuselah I just wonder
[1:07:56] it's just me I'm weird he picks up his
[1:07:59] son Methuselah the Bible says at the
[1:08:01] birth of Methuselah he begins to walk
[1:08:02] with God I wonder if he picked up his
[1:08:04] son and looked into his eyes and said
[1:08:06] now you know you came from me but I
[1:08:09] wonder where I came from
[1:08:10] I just wonder because it was at the
[1:08:12] birth of his son Methuselah began to
[1:08:14] walk with God see there was something
[1:08:17] that happened when he could hold his own
[1:08:18] son in his hands and he was thinking now
[1:08:21] I'm a father to you but who's my father
[1:08:23] Where'd I come from and where am I going
[1:08:26] who am I then he began to walk with God
[1:08:30] and in that Journey he walked for some
[1:08:32] time and then he took one more Step In
[1:08:34] the Journey
[1:08:35] that third step and that third step took
[1:08:37] him from one dimension to another
[1:08:39] that's the one I'm looking forward to
[1:08:41] musicians we come
[1:08:45] amen
[1:08:47] get you home early there's a lot of sick
[1:08:49] people at home maybe you got to get home
[1:08:50] and take care of somebody
[1:08:52] but why don't you turn in your Bibles to
[1:08:55] First John 3 1.
[1:09:04] we read the first portion of this at the
[1:09:06] opening we'll read both portions of it
[1:09:09] here at the end
[1:09:11] first John
[1:09:12] 3 1.
[1:09:15] it says beloved what manner of love the
[1:09:18] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[1:09:20] should be called the sons of God
[1:09:22] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:09:25] because it knew him not
[1:09:28] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[1:09:31] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:09:33] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:09:37] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:09:40] as he is
[1:09:42] amen
[1:09:43] don't be shocked if the world doesn't
[1:09:45] recognize who you are it's okay they
[1:09:48] didn't even recognize Jesus his own
[1:09:50] family his own mother I did this didn't
[1:09:53] identify him don't worry it didn't
[1:09:55] matter
[1:09:55] you're identified by the word the word
[1:09:58] is your identification that's your
[1:10:00] father that's the one you walk in
[1:10:02] confidence to I just want to please him
[1:10:05] the word that's the one I'm looking to
[1:10:07] please that's the one I'm looking
[1:10:09] remember the composer he didn't he
[1:10:11] didn't care if he heard booze or cheers
[1:10:13] when he was playing his composition on
[1:10:16] the piano he had his eyes on his master
[1:10:19] just wanted to see what did his master
[1:10:21] think did he find approval in the eyes
[1:10:23] of his master that's the one that we
[1:10:25] want to have we find approval in the
[1:10:27] eyes of God not what brothers not what
[1:10:30] churches think about us it's what God
[1:10:32] thinks about us will you stand
[1:10:34] for a moment I don't know who that was
[1:10:36] all for I really don't I I I I just I
[1:10:41] just go by inspiration and and if he
[1:10:43] doesn't lead me in a different direction
[1:10:45] I have no options I just don't I don't
[1:10:48] have the ability that others do I wish I
[1:10:51] could teach I wish I could break things
[1:10:52] down I don't I just get inspiration
[1:10:54] something starts to come and move me and
[1:10:56] I go to scripture in this scripture and
[1:10:58] this and then I just say well Lord you
[1:11:00] know I don't know I have never had
[1:11:02] confidence in me and I still don't have
[1:11:04] confidence in me in fact the older I get
[1:11:06] the less confidence I have in me so I
[1:11:09] was talking to a brother Oswald you know
[1:11:11] brother Oscar and uh Malawi yesterday
[1:11:13] and it was so interesting he told me he
[1:11:15] said he said he had a I got about
[1:11:18] blinded you know maybe six seven years
[1:11:19] ago I don't remember if you know that
[1:11:21] and he said you know brother it's been
[1:11:23] tough God hasn't brought my healing
[1:11:25] right away I I labor with this year
[1:11:28] after year after year he said but you
[1:11:30] know the Lord used me to bring more
[1:11:32] souls in the last six years with this
[1:11:34] eye injury than I ever did with both
[1:11:36] eyes working good he said I've LED
[1:11:39] multiple people to the Lord just on the
[1:11:41] trips to go to the doctor and he was
[1:11:44] just tell me just in the last week he
[1:11:45] led some very big panic I don't know
[1:11:48] what it was the nominational Theologian
[1:11:50] who asked him a question what is the
[1:11:52] godhead and he just sat there and broke
[1:11:54] it down for him and he said I want to be
[1:11:56] baptized the way you say it needs to be
[1:11:58] baptized and he says so God's using me
[1:12:01] in my weakness I said ain't it something
[1:12:02] I wonder how strong the Bride of Jesus
[1:12:04] Christ gets at the end I wonder if she
[1:12:06] realizes she gets weaker and weaker but
[1:12:08] God gets stronger and stronger he begins
[1:12:11] to perform things in her weakness that
[1:12:13] she can never do in her strength just
[1:12:15] like David it was when David was ready
[1:12:17] he took out the Goliath so maybe it's
[1:12:19] maybe don't worry about how strong we
[1:12:21] are I said Lord just make me weaker just
[1:12:22] get me weaker get me more broken so I
[1:12:25] can just do your will and I was just
[1:12:27] just so encouraged in that and so let's
[1:12:29] just bow our heads for a word of Prayer
[1:12:33] most gracious Heavenly Father
[1:12:35] again thank you Lord to be able to see
[1:12:38] ourselves in the pages of the book to
[1:12:40] see that this isn't a mystery just made
[1:12:42] known to us it's a mystery that's made
[1:12:44] known in US
[1:12:45] father it's it's just it's
[1:12:48] shocking
[1:12:50] Lord I just I want to walk in it more
[1:12:52] with a more clearness in my mind and in
[1:12:55] my life I want to understand that even
[1:12:57] more every day I want it to that
[1:12:59] Revelation to so grit me that I I can't
[1:13:01] talk the way I used to I can't walk I
[1:13:04] can't pursue anything because I I know
[1:13:06] now who my father is he had clearly
[1:13:09] identified me as a Son of God father
[1:13:11] that's my prayer for each and every one
[1:13:13] of us both young and old no matter where
[1:13:16] they are who they are may they recognize
[1:13:18] this isn't just a a group of ideas or
[1:13:22] doctrines spoken by a by a prophet or
[1:13:26] from a man from Kentucky oh this is the
[1:13:28] Mighty God came down identified before
[1:13:31] us Lord you led the wise men by a star
[1:13:34] that star led the wise men to the word
[1:13:37] made manifested word made flesh father
[1:13:40] we have seen his star we've seen your
[1:13:42] prophet and we've recognized and
[1:13:44] followed that star to a literal life of
[1:13:47] Jesus Christ father now we're just
[1:13:50] Desiring to see it expressed in Us
[1:13:52] manifested in everything that we do and
[1:13:54] say more and more each and every day
[1:13:57] father help us forgive us Lord for those
[1:14:00] things we do wrong we make big mistakes
[1:14:02] father Lord forgive us we don't mean to
[1:14:04] we don't want to do those things may we
[1:14:07] lord walk with a better understanding as
[1:14:09] we are maturing we're no longer children
[1:14:11] we're becoming adults a mature bride
[1:14:15] father may it take control of our
[1:14:17] thoughts it can take control of our
[1:14:19] words may we start talking like David
[1:14:21] who is this uncircumcised Philistine may
[1:14:24] we talk like Jesus it is written it is
[1:14:26] written it is written then the Devil
[1:14:28] comes to tempt us and bring distractions
[1:14:30] on our way we just say what the word
[1:14:32] said we don't say anything but the word
[1:14:34] because the word has identified us now

[1:19:35] just continues to unveil in our hearts
[1:19:37] may it honestly With all sincerity be
[1:19:40] something that's revealed through us
[1:19:42] something that the world will have to
[1:19:44] testify
[1:19:45] who are these people what is this
[1:19:48] they'll have to stand like Saul and say
[1:19:50] who is this boy who is his father where
[1:19:54] did he come from
[1:19:55] I want people to nudge the person beside
[1:19:58] him and say
[1:19:59] where'd this fellow come from I want him
[1:20:01] to see being so shocked of Our Lives
[1:20:03] such humility such simpleness such love
[1:20:08] one for another this is how all men will
[1:20:11] know that you're my disciples you will
[1:20:12] have a love one for another a love that
[1:20:15] passes all understanding I love that
[1:20:17] ought not be there but it's there and it
[1:20:19] manifests so shocking to the world
[1:20:22] they'll say who is this boy's father
