========================================
[Music] we want to see jesus to reach out and touch it [Music] to say that we love [Music] is [Music] we want to say open our eyes [Music] we want to see jesus [Music] dreams [Music] [Music] [Music] amen god bless you amen may we see him in the breaking of bread this evening because he revealed himself to his disciples on the road to emmaus by the way he broke the bread amen god bless you it's a pleasure to be here together we're excited to have brother samuel vawak i've been saying his last name wrong for a couple years now so i i learned how to say it better and it's probably still not right but hopefully it's better but we're happy to have him we know his as father brother yadzik he's been here before and i first met brother samuel in 2019 when i was there in their place and then their church and we had a good time there he did the interpreting for me and he's a very gifted interpreter we had a good time together during the service and i'm excited that he's able to stop by he was in the united states preaching in some other places and i asked him to let me know if he ever comes and he was faithful to do that and i said please include us in your trip and so he was able to make it work so we're very thankful that he's here today and so i pray that you'll just pull on the gift and just relax and receive the word from our lord today i got two announcements i want to make real quick before we turn the service over next wednesday we're going to start our tape service i always like to go through a tape together where we go through the book and listen to the tape together we ask the questions before and we answer them afterwards well i'd like to do that every winter but we're going to start that this coming wednesday the tape that we're going to do is god's power to transform from 1965 from september 11th so sunday we'll set all the books out on a rack out here by the welcome desk so you can get a fresh book or if you've got a book or if you want to use your tablet uh that's the that's the message that we'll be going through i think it'll take us three wednesdays to go through that so you can pick up your book i'll remind you again on sunday to pick that up so we'll start that on wednesday also several of the brothers and sisters have asked if there's any way that we can get funds to the brethren in ukraine so i've been working on that today and we've found a couple different ways that we're exploring to get some funds over to the believers there they're in desperate need many are trying to travel to western ukraine to get out of the country or just get away from the fighting others are stuck where they're at and can't get out shelves are empty their economy is plunging you know there's just a lot of trouble but there's some ways that brothers have been able to get funds in so we're sending some funds tomorrow to be able to help if you would like to send something if you just on the tithe envelope will mark on special needs just ukraine or ukrainian brethren we'll make sure that we do all we can to get that to them this is a tough time amen but we're one family and so we'd like to do whatever we can for them there amen so if you would like to do that just remember that on the tithe envelope god bless you amen let's turn our hearts to the lord and let's receive the word amen this evening brother ben if we could invite our brother with a song [Music] gently [Music] is [Music] amen praise the lord that's what we are longing for to be in the presence of the lord so i believe that we are in a good place at the right time with the right people i believe that god is here i believe that he is going to bless us tonight hopefully you didn't come for any man you know to see a person to see somebody but we all gathered here with one purpose to see god you know we want to see god but he isn't somewhere you know above the clouds we need to recognize where he is tonight and i believe if we recognize that then he is going to bless us because he always blesses those that recognize his presence amen that that make him feel welcome that's what we want to do tonight amen so i bring greetings from our church back home from poland from baja novitse uh from my pastor who's also my dad brother yatzek valach he was here i think in 2020 and he sends his greetings amen so i also appreciate barry chad for the opportunity that he gave me to be with you and and to share with the word of god i believe that he's going to speak to us tonight amen so while you're standing let's open ii samuel chapter 6 verses 14 through 23 maybe that's a more lengthy portion of scripture but we'll go through it and lay a foundation amen amen if we are all right with the fact that like paul says that it pleases the lord to use the foolishness of preaching to save man if we are comfortable with that fact i believe that we all will be blessed tonight amen so let's read second samuel chapter 6 verses 14 to 23 and david danced before the lord with all his might and david was girded with a linen ephod so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michael saul's daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart and they brought up the ark of the lord and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and david offered burned offerings and peace offerings before the lord and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel as well to the women as men to everyone a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine and all the people departed everyone to his house then david turned to bless his household and michael the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel today who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself and david said unto michael it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore i will play before the lord and i will yet be more be more vile than thus and will be based in mine own sight and of the made servants which thou has spoken of of them shall i be had in honor therefore michael the daughter of saul had no child under the day of her death and a short scripture found in luke chapter 7 verses 22 and 23 look chapter 7 verse 22 and 23 it's the portion of scripture when john the baptist while he's in prison he sends his disciples to ask if jesus was truly the messiah if he was christ if he was the one that was supposed to come and we see the answer of jesus to their question then jesus answered unto them go your way and tell john what things you have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached and i'd like to stress verse 23 and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me amen whosoever shall not be offended in me amen let's bow our heads for a word of prayer dear heavenly father we come into your presence father and like your prophet said that we are creators we are creators of atmosphere father and tonight we want to create the atmosphere of faith father because we realize that's the atmosphere that you like that's the atmosphere that pleases you and that's the atmosphere that you're comfortable in father so i believe if we create that kind of atmosphere you're going to perform wonders father you're going to come to this building father walk among the pews father reach all of the hearts all of the needs all of the people that are gathered here father we need you we are a needy people father we need to hear from you once again may you take every flesh out of the way father my own flesh and the people that came to listen father may we all be set out of the way and may the word of god has have its preeminence father that's what we ask that's what we need we bless the portion of scripture that we've read in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may take your seats praise the lord i'd like to share with you on a on a topic what do you see looking out your window what do you see looking out your window amen so we are thankful for the message amen and and we can talk about it you know uh over and over again but if we truly realize what the message is and who the message is we can be truly thankful to the lord amen so and before receiving the message we need to realize the day that we are living in because brad brown said that we need to recognize our day and its message amen so we realize the times that we are living in and we are recognized that we are called to be a people of this time to live in the end time age to perform the work for the for the end time age a man and there was always a message which was allotted for a certain group of people for a certain period of time and we see that throughout the ages that there was a portion of the message being released to the people but if we realize the time that we are living in that that's the end time we realize that's the time of the restoration of the entirety of that book of that fullness so we are not waiting just for a portion another portion another blessing another reformer another message we see that the message is the restoration of everything because the message was sent to restore all of the loose ends and tie them together amen we believe that and we know that all of the ages the church ages before us that was one thing but then we see brother bruno who preached the the sermon he we we know that he preached on the exposition of the seven church ages but then he went into the seals and before preaching the seals he preached this the sermon the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals and we see that's not a a bridge that's not something that you go easily from the church ages into the seals it's a breach it's a gap it's something it's it's it's a chasm that is between so it is not easy for the church to follow into the seals and we know that the seals are christ so we are truly privileged if we are we are able to see what the seals are and who the seals are praise the lord so we appreciate the message very much you know and we see sometimes problems with the people around the message there are no problems with the message itself we see that there are problems within the ranks of the message or the people that are associated with the message and the problem is that they do not understand what the message is amen they see it as an information they see it as something a good addition to their christian life they see that that's a message of william branham the man you know they they think it is something that came out of jeffersonville or came out of arizona or was preached in 1950 or 60 you know that something that started i don't know in 1909 or 1950 or 1963 whatever the date is if they think that way that becomes a powerless religion that's why we see people leaving and i believe there are many who live in the states there are people certainly who leave the message in poland because we are at the end time and everybody has to show their colors so we truly need to understand what the message is you know and messi the message is certainly not something that you can associate to a certain date or a certain century or to some man you know because the message is not framed in time it is not earthbound it is not not time limited it is eternal amen i was truly blessed when i looked at the word logos the word logos in the dictionary we know that means the word we know is the expression of one's thought the other meaning is speech but there is also another meaning of the word logos which is message i was truly blessed when i read that you know because we see that the message is not something new it's not a new idea it is not something that was invented in the 20th century it was not something that brother brown thought of or brought out it he was just the channel he was just the tool but the message itself is eternal is as eternal as logos is praise the lord so we are following something eternal something of of an eternal value which is not framed in time so we can be thankful for that amen in the oncoming storm brother brown says oh you might laugh at the messenger you might be able even to kill him but you cannot kill the message it will go on just the same because god's message is eternal his word will never fail amen so that gives us the confidence that we need in this hour because everything that can be shaken will be shaken and we see that it is being shaken right now so we need that confidence that the message is something eternal something that came straight out of the mind of god and that is sent for the specific time that we live in for the specific people that we are to lead us to a specific purpose to a specific goal which is the rapture which is just which is the changing of our bodies amen because we need to get out of here and the only way how we can get out of here in from the earthly to the heavenly from the mortal to the immortal getting out to eternity is receiving an eternal portion which is the eternal message of god sent for this hour amen so we are called upon to receive the message and we are also called upon for a specific purpose and we know the scripture found in isaiah 60 it says arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee amen for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and grows darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee amen that's a great promise it's not a promise only about our times that we see darkness and we see the light but this is becoming personal because it's not only that this sun shines you know a great light but it says die light has come amen and if we take it personally that becomes a powerful statement to us amen because that's your light that's my light amen praise the lord so we know that the darkness covers the nation the nations all around us but there shall be light in the evening time amen and however dark it will get and we've seen some dark moments in recent years but however dark it will get the promise still holds that there shall be light about the evening time and that is your light this is my light amen because we know that james says that he is the father of lights it doesn't say he is the father of light we knew that but right now we realize that he is the father of lights and we are those lights amen and that's why isaiah could say thy light has come so arise and shine amen though there is gross darkness in the earth all around us there's gross darkness amen because all around us we see laodicea which is blind naked and in darkness and doesn't know it but yet there is light in the land of goshen so we see the world that we live in we see the world of human rights we see the world of abundance of being self-sufficient of being independent we see people being rich and that's why they do not need god they do not need anything else but themselves amen so we see the state of the world around us brett brown told us that people are getting wiser but they are getting weaker amen and we can feel that we are still in those human bodies and when i compare myself to my grandparents you know even my parents i believe that the the flesh that i'm in it's weaker because of the food because of the circumstances everything else you know and we see it among the people that their bodies are weak people are getting wiser but they are weaker they are also weaker in their spirits we see a lot of mental illnesses around the world we see depression we see all kinds of issues when it comes to the human spirit and that's why it is said that we are weaker and weaker but yet wiser on the other side amen and the age that we live in is a peculiar age is is not to be compared with other ages and one of the things that we see in the world today is that the world gets offended real quickly amen i believe that especially in in in europe and in the united states we can see that how people are oversensitive they are sensitive on a number of issues number of topics you can offend them easily by your words because it is the time where the word has power we know that the word has power and also the word in the natural seems to have power over the people it can hurt people it can offend people just natural words whatever you speak your opinions your decisions your actions they have a certain influence on the people and they get offended and an offense is the condition of having your feelings hurt as a result of somebody's actions or words so usually people who get offended get offended at things that are none of their business they they are offended at things that do not affect them directly or indirectly that's how people get offended they get offended about comments of people they do not know they do not care about but they get offended anyhow that's the times that we are living in and i believe that the natural types the spiritual so if there is an issue in the natural world there is also an issue that we need to notice in the other realm because all that we see is a manifestation of the spiritual world either the good side of spiritual world or the bad side of the spiritual world because that's a battle amen so people are offended by some of these choices or opinions or decisions or or the way somebody lives their lives so it's a generation of people who are oversensitive you know and people can be can can be offended by virtually anything you know even even in the church you know people get offended if because some people like for their preacher to preach 45 minutes the other wants them to preach for two hours and you've got people offended at the end of the service so if you came tonight with an expectation i don't know what your expectation is but i'm sure if there is an expectation about the time limit somebody may you know may come out of the service and their expectation was not met amen so we live it in a time you know that people get offended over every issue we see the issue maybe somebody is vaccinated somebody is not you know people get offended people break fellowship with each other over these things you know somebody goes on holidays every year somebody doesn't because he thinks that makes him spiritual and then he's offended that the other person goes on holidays that's right or that's just in europe no i mean somebody buys a new car and somebody's offended by the one that that bought the new car somebody else drives a a beater you know a truck that doesn't you know it's old and rusty and so on and somebody else is also offended because that's that's not how christians are supposed to live they should be blessed they should prosper you know so we get people whatever you do there is somebody who is going to be offended amen so there are endless ways to get offended and and us as human beings we are uh we are good creators of of offenses of of things that we can be offended by amen but i believe i'm saying all of that to show us that i believe that's the sign of the times that we live in actually we'll look into matthew the 24th chapter a very well-known scripture that speaks of our times matthew the 24th chapter from verse 5. for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famine and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of sorrows amen so i believe that we can agree that we see all of these things happening we see we've heard rumors of wars now we see wars happening and you know in poland we see wars happening at our doorstep you know it's closer than we than we thought even a week ago but we are not surprised because we can read it in the scripture you know the same goes for pestilence we've seen the pandemic we've seen covet 19 for the last two years you know so we shouldn't be surprised these these things are coming because god told us they would amen verse 9 then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake verse 10 and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax called but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved amen so we see the things that are foretold about the end times we see the natural things happening and we are not surprised by that we see the things that are foretold about people's attitude how how how mankind or people around us would uh would act in the end times amen and it says that many shall be offended a sign of the end times we know that offense will come but the bible says woe unto the one that the offense comes by amen and the word offense is the greek word scandalon and i i truly like this word sometimes i i like to i'm not i don't know greek i don't know hebrew i don't know anything about it but then sometimes i check it and the meaning is really powerful it goes deeper than i thought and the word offense is scandalous in greek and it means offense or it means a trap and exactly the trigger of a trap like you have a mousetrap and there is a trigger for the trap hey man so that's the mechanism that closes the trap wherever whenever the mouse comes in so and also the trigger of the trap is very sensitive you don't need much force or power to activate it you just need a little bit of emotion amen and then it's going to kill you that's a mousetrap that's scandal that's offense amen you know but if it says that it's it's a trap i believe that we've been given a message and brother brown tells us that victory means knowing our enemy in all his tricks all his traps all his ways of waging war amen so we see in the bible let's go through the bible through different examples of how people got offended and you know if you think about people being offended the first thing you'll notice it was the pharisees in the old testament or the new testament you know the pharisees in the bible they were the most uh offensible people that there ever was whatever you did that didn't match their tradition or their interpretation of the law they would be offended and we see through uh the gospels that they were offended by jesus on every step amen because jesus being god in human flesh he was god in human flesh so they they were offended by what he did in that flesh amen praise the lord you know they saw jesus coming during the sabbath on different occasions actually it wasn't just something that he did once he made a mistake or something like that no he did it multiple times during the sabbath that he would either perform a certain work or heal somebody you know or or do something that would distract their order so they were offended that he would do something on the sabbath not knowing that he was the lord of the sabbath amen he was the rest he was the one that was leading people into rest not a day of the week but a person something real amen praise the lord but the pharisees they were offended they were offended by the disciples while they were going through a field they would gather wheat and probably that was also on sabbath but so there are multiple occasions how pharisees could be offended we see when jesus was coming down to jerusalem there were people crying they were people shouting hosanna hosanna and the pharisees came to jesus came to his disciples and said we are offended we are offended by what the people say how they shout and jesus said if they do not shout if they do not cry out the rocks will amen so so pharisees were offended again and again and again when jesus healed the blind person they were offended again well they were offended also by the fact or by the way he performed that miracle you know because he came as a rabbi as somebody who taught the gospel who taught uh the law or or who was a teacher some of them called him teacher but then he came to a blind person and he spat on the ground he made mud he put it on his eyes and he told him to walk amen they were offended so it didn't take much for them to be offended because they were very religious so if somebody is very religious they easily get offended amen that's how how you can sense or see or recognize a very religious person he gets offended all the time all the time amen but we do not want to deal with you know the pharisees or or the nominations or somebody else you know the outside world we know that's true for for all of them that they easily get offended but let's look a little bit closer we see in the times of jacob jacob's sons there were 12 of them 10 came from leah and two came from rachel and we know that rachel was the beloved wife of jacob it was the wife that he chose as the first wife but then he was tricked into marrying leah and he had to work his way for uh for rachel you know and so she she was the beloved wife and there was this other wife that was also there who gave jacob more children 10 10 children 10 sons but we see that there was always a rivalry between the sisters between rachel and leah they would always compete for the the status of the beloved wife which didn't help because rachel was always beloved from the very beginning to the very end jacob never changed his mind on that whatever leah tried to produce however many sons she would produce that would not change anything in god's program that's what we see we see churches they try to produce program after program they try to produce fruit after fruit after fruit but yet nothing will change their status there is one beloved wife and that's the bride of christ amen but we see that they competed for or actually maybe uh it was leah who tried to compete for for the number one position and we see that it had an effect on the children as well we see that there there was also a difference between the the the children of rachel which was joseph and benjamin and of the rest of the of the sons of jacob that came from leah and we see that it didn't make it any better when jacob gave joseph a coat of many colors actually that's not a good parental advice to pick one child and make him the most favorite one you know and so he would get he got this coat of many colors and so the brothers of joseph they they were really offended by it they were offended by the drop you know they they were not just offended by the robe because it was special it was it was colorful it was new it was something else you know but uh you know they were offended by something else because it symbolized something that he was chosen that joseph was the chosen child the chosen son and you know the the the sons of leah uh they knew that this code came from the father they knew it was the father's code given to joseph amen they realized that but yet it was offensive to them even though they knew that it was the father's gift amen so it was a trap it is a trap it was a chaff for them because they got offended and you know they started to plot to kill him you always have a choice either to get offended it's your choice to get offended or not that's our choice we can either choose to be offended by somebody else or we choose not to be offended that's our choice and we know that the enemy comes to steal to kill and to devour and the spirit of offense is just that kind of spirit it's the spirit of the enemy it's an assassin in white gloves you know he smiles he he acts real nice but if he's offended he's bitter on the inside he's going to kill you that's how satan wants to trap us he wants to lay traps on us he wants those little triggers of that traps to go off every time we walk every time we make a motion you know but that's a spirit and it wasn't about the new rope it was about the position that the father gave to joseph that's what triggered them that's what made them offended amen but it wasn't joseph the claim of joseph it wasn't the claim of joseph that he was somebody special it was the father who gave him that position hey man it wasn't something that he aspired for it wasn't the position that he hoped for or he he tricked somebody to to be on a position like that no no it was given to him by the father amen he couldn't change that the word claimed he was who he was amen he didn't have to claim it for himself he didn't have to claim i'm the beloved son i'm joseph i'm chosen of the father no the word told everybody that he was chosen amen praise the lord so we see that joseph received a dream from god that showed him as the main sheath and there would be sheaves all around him that would bow down to him and that was a dream and that was a dream that he had to pay a price for amen that was a costly dream he had to lay many years of his life being a slave in egypt and going through difficult difficulties from one difficulty to another and it was the price that he had to pay for his dream amen for what the word told him he was he had to pay for that amen it didn't come cheap amen i believe there is also a vision of the bride of the end time there is a vision given to us that you are part of that preview of that spotless lam's wife and i believe there is also a price that you need to pay it doesn't come cheap the the first coming of pr of christ didn't come cheap there was a price that had to be paid and that was the price of of of the life of the innocent lamb of god that had to be paid whatever god does is not cheap god is not cheap because he is rich he's rich in in everything in resources in everything so that's why when he came that wasn't a cheap visit amen he came down and it was expensive he had to pay the price that's why the second coming is is no different there is a prize that we need to pay as joseph did for the dream of the word the word was shown to him showed him his position and then he had to go through different things in life that brought him straight to the palace amen to his position praise the lord so people get offended brothers of joseph they got offended they didn't get offended by the word you know they all believed the word they believed abraham they believed isaac they believed jacob they believed all of these things so they believed the logos but when the logos started to pull pour itself out into an a vessel that's where the problem arose so it's not the logos that gets people offended it's the keynotes it's the pouring out of god emptying of god into human flesh that's where the problem arises and and we can see that that when the word comes in flesh that's where problems start when the word was with god there was no problem when when uh you know god was in the beginning with his own thoughts that was not a problem the problem was when he started to come in flesh amen when he started to manifest himself when the word came into fruition that was the problem amen and let's look at another example which is found in israel chapter 3 verses 10 to 13. israel chapter 3 verse 10 to 13. is that me okay israel chapter 3 verse 10 let's read and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with symbols to praise the lord after the ordinance of david king of israel and they sang together by by course in praising and giving thanks unto the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever toward israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of the house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off amen so we see israel in his time in his time we see that it was the time of the rebuilding of the temple the temple was being rebuilt and there were two groups of people that came out of babylon they came as one nation israelites under one commission from the king of of babylon uh they they were commissioned to come out and to rebuild the city and the temple so they came out of babylon out of bondage but some of them were not happy some of them left the the land of bondage with an expectation and we see that also happening in the time of exodus in time of moses that people came out it seemed like they came out as one nation under god whatever you know however it looked like at first it looked real nice but after a while it turned out that people came out with their own expectations and that's when trouble came because people wanted to see something that they didn't see they expected moses to go a certain way and he didn't they expected god to be somebody who he wasn't and that's what we see here in another exodus from babylon and we see the rebuilding of the temple and it was the people that were all in spirit it it wasn't peop definitely it wasn't people who were old in the flesh because age doesn't matter with god you can be very young or very old and be young in the spirit and that's what counts if you are old in the spirit you may be 20 years old you may be a teenager by but old in spirit that will be a problem so we see people who are old in spirit you know there are people who seen it all they've been there they've done that they they remembered the old temple and they were the people that got offended the fastest we see that we see that while the temple was being rebuilt it was the time of restoration stone after stone they were building from ashes to a glorious temple but yet people cried because they were offended because their expectations were not met they came out with an expectation of how the temple would look like and it did not fit their expectations their memories their traditions amen they're good old ways it didn't fit into that pattern that's why they cried they were not happy during the time of restoration seeing the word the word being restored they were not happy they cried amen they were offended they are offended by the new thing that god was doing because new is offensive amen new is offensive it is a challenge to the old ways it is the challenge to traditions to memories to history amen but god says behold i do a new thing amen and you shall not remember the old things shall not even remember the old things amen and again in the time of israel in the time of the rebuilding of the temple people were not offended by the logos people were offended by the kinos of how the word would come out manifest itself amen and the scripture that we've read from ii samuel about the restoration of the ark of the covenant back to his rightful place to jerusalem amen we've read in chapters in verse 16. and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michael saul's daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart amen so we see michael who was the first wife of david was the very first wife of david like leah was the first wife of jacob and michael was the wife that david didn't like didn't love maybe he liked her but he didn't love her which for a wife is not good enough definitely right but we see uh that she came from a house and actually it is mentioned here and i think every time michael is being mentioned in the scripture she is mentioned as saul's daughter amen and we'll see what that means and how it affected her you know because we see saul uh we know that he was an israelite he was born an israelite he was born in the right kind of nation he at first he was chosen as the first king of israel he uh everything went smoothly but then he made a few mistakes that led to him that led to the fact that the spirit departed from him he didn't have the spirit he was an israelite he was a part of the church he was part of the community he was part of that nation but the spirit left him and that was a problem because from that time saul wanted to kill david he wanted to kill the anointed one which was david he was anointed to be the king of israel after saul that was the man after god's own heart but yet soul wanted to kill him and he didn't want to kill him with his hands he wanted to kill him with the hands of the philistines so he would send him to battles here and there and every time david would come back victorious and bringing you know trophies and everything and so saul tried to find a way to kill him and every scheme that he figured out it failed so the bible says that then after a while he decided to use his own daughter as a trap he used michael he he told david that if he slew the philistines he would give michael to him for a wife but it was supposed to be a trap amen so he used michael as a trap as a scandalon as an offense and we'll see what that means after a while so that was a mousetrap and david was supposed to be killed by the hands of the philistines because of the trap that was set so michael finally became david's wife but she wasn't the beloved wife of david you know and she was the daughter of saul that's how the scripture describes her because she was the the daughter of a man who was offended many times by the fact that david was better than him that that david was chosen over him so was offended so was offended when he heard the song that was being sung in those days because they had one song it was you know it had one verse that saul killed his thousand and it was a good song you know they they they sang it over and over and over again but then david came along you know he started to be victorious he was anointed he was filled he was chosen and they then they added another verse the people did they didn't erase the first one they just added another one right which would make the song up to date because there was david you know so they then they sang that saul killed his thousand but david killed his tens of thousands amen so that was another verse that they edit and saul didn't like that he was offended by that new song amen and we see michael she was the daughter of soul so that means that she was still under his authority although she was david's wife so meaning that she was supposed to take david's authority or david's hatship she was still under saul's authority amen so we see the story here we see that the word was coming back to jerusalem we see david who was rejoicing after you know he tried to bring the the ark of the covenant the first time it didn't work out he learned his lesson and now he did it the right way according to the word of god according to how it was supposed to be handled he brought the ark and he was rejoicing he was dancing because he knew that the ark of the covenant the word would be coming back to jerusalem amen so he was rejoice rejoicing and michael was not with him there are a lot of people there but michael was not one of them she was just watching from her window the window of her palace she was there and she watched the entire procession you know she took no part in it she just watched and judged from her window criticized had her opinion got offended amen she watched the word being restored she watched her husband acting in a way which wasn't a king-like way it wasn't something that a king was supposed to do amen so she criticized him in her heart his dance his actions and also the song that he wrote for that occasion which is found in psalms 24 9 and 10 lift up your heads o e gates even lift them up the everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory selah hey man but she she didn't like the song because she was saul's daughter she remembered the old song you know that the song they used to sing in her father's house the good old song the hymns and everything and she didn't understand the new song she didn't understand the meaning of the words who is the king of glory why is it important that he was supposed to come she didn't understand the restoration of the of the word she liked the old songs about how moses brought the children of israel out of egypt how they crossed the red sea and all of the wonderful testimonies you know the mana that came down she liked those songs she didn't like the current songs that expressed the revelation of the hour she didn't because she wasn't part of the bryce revival that's that's why she didn't that's that's very simple if you are part of a revival then you've got nothing against songs that express your revival that expresses the state of your soul that express your inner being your thoughts and your revival praise the lord so she was offended she didn't expect to see her husband acting this way amen she was disappointed she was disappointed seeing the word in flesh she was disappointed seeing the word being restored restored to jerusalem coming back after all of these years of captivity being in the hands of the philistines then staying in in the house of a man who took care of it after all of these years the people were rejoicing they they knew that the presence of the lord would be coming back to jerusalem but she didn't understand it amen so we see who stood in the window seeing the word being restored but then she turned her back she walked inside she asked her musicians to play that old song saul killed his thousand she liked that old song she didn't want anything to do with that revival she she she believed she was the an israelite she was king's daughter and everything but she didn't like the word in flesh amen therefore michael this the daughter of saul had no child until the day of her death amen so people are not offended by logos they are offended by kinos amen and it repeats over and over and over again amen we see another woman who also had her window and was looking from that window and that woman was the wife of a great man of a friend of god abraham and the woman was sarah amen but the difference between michael and sarah is that sarah she was not the daughter of the father of in law of abraham but she was the wife of abraham amen that was the difference you know and she called her husband lord and but it came to a time in her life in their life where there was no evidence of a revival there was no evidence no proof that the word of god was supposed to come to fruition come to manifestation in their lives so she became also bitter she became offended offended by things around her you know and right around tells us the story you know how one day abraham sat in front of his tent and he saw three men far off three strangers and he saw them and he ran to them and he asked them in he asked them he invited them to have fellowship with them so sarah was also there and barbara tells us what sarah thought she thought how many more fanatics will my husband entertain today these were her thoughts so she was bitter a bitter old lady she she didn't have any proof of being chosen of being blessed of being favored she had no son she had no evidence that's why she was bitter that's why she got offended quickly because that spirit was upon her and we see that she was offended by the strangers definitely she was offended by abraham by his behavior that he would entertain strangers all the time and he was you know and he she thought of of the people that came that they were fanatics you know but and but she did everything that she she had to she held with the meal but then she came back and went into her tent and there was also a window in the tent and she looked she watched these three strangers she she watched the word in human flesh she was her husband and she had her thoughts about it and the bible says that elohim said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed within her saying after i am wax old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child which i'm old so we know that god could have killed her at this point but the you know she wasn't a daughter of some man she was the wife of a person who was treated as a friend of god hey man that's why she couldn't be killed because she was identified with abraham and abraham was a friend of god he wasn't just some servant or somebody you know that god knew of he was the friend of god he he was actually the person that when elohim was supposed to destroy sodom and abraham was the one who was interceding for the people of sodom god said shall i hide away from my friend abraham that which i'm supposed to do he couldn't hide anything from abraham amen because he was a friend of god and sarah was a part of abraham that's why she couldn't be killed amen because she called him lord she knew her hatship she wasn't saul's daughter she was abraham's wife amen so that's all about being identified be identified as the lamb's wife don't be identified as saul's daughter of or a daughter of some direction or a daughter of some dynamic denomination some church amen so what do you see looking out your window while you look through your window what do you see amen our windows we've got our eyes these are windows you know these are our thoughts you know we can watch something we can criticize we can think oh we like we can judge and everything what do you see from your window we've seen we've seen people who look through windows and judge the word we see michael who saw the restoration of the word coming to jerusalem coming back to the bride which is jerusalem and she had her opinion she had her judgment she had her critical spirit what do you think of jesus called the christ and the question was not what do you think of jehovah what do you think of the creator of the heavens and the earth but what do you think of jesus called the christ what do you think of the word becoming flesh what do you think of it what's your opinion are you offended hey man so people are offended not by logos but by kinos amen brabram says in the sermon lean not unto your own understanding 65 he says blessed is he who is not offended in me quoting the scripture he says so many have been offended so many people get offended so easily at the word of god it's contrary they want to lean to their own understanding they don't want to take the word of the lord and they have to go just the way that they have been taught and the way that they were taught their church leans upon it no matter if god promised he would he would rain have rain in the morning the church said that's nonsense they would believe the church instead of god because why because they are born of the church but a man that's born of god is of the seed of god and the the seed of god is the word of god and he only lives by that that's his life amen so there is a difference between somebody who leans on the understanding of the church and who is of the seed of god seed of god which is the word of god and he only lives by that amen so what we've read is blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me that's these are the words of jesus amen and jesus did not say blessed is he who shall not be offended by my disciples blessed is he who shall not be offended by my church by the members of my church that's not what jesus said amen but he said that the challenge is blessed is he who is not offended of me of the word amen praise the lord of the word not the logos but the word and flesh the manifestation of the word amen we see judas he was offended by the woman that came to jesus with the oil with the perfume he was offended by her action he was offended also by the reaction of jesus he didn't understand that amen and during the last supper we know that christ told them this night you all shall be offended because of me wow what a statement no why because they had they all had their expectations because they were not converted jesus said to peter when you are converted go strengthen my brothers he was not converted and so other disciples they were not converted they they weren't changed their thinking was not changed that's why they had expectations of jesus that he would never fulfill they had their own thoughts and jesus said that this night you shall all be offended nothing of what you expected of me will come to pass you will be disappointed in me in my ministry this night amen and we see what happened after jesus died we see the disciples on the road to emmaus we see how they were disappointed you know they they would say that they had great great expectations of the ministry of jesus that never came to pass we see peter who after jesus died he went fishing he came back to to where he came from you know he was also offended because his expectations were not met amen and we see in our times we see elohim comes to the chosen seat of abraham we see the temple being rebuilt we see the vision of joseph coming to pass amen praise the lord we see the word coming back to jerusalem we see all of these things amen and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another amen one of the of the signs of the end time amen matthew 24 but it's all because of the ministry of the third pool as all because of the word coming in flesh coming in manifestation that's why people get offended they would never be offended by just reading a quote or reading the scripture but when they see it being manifested in you and i that's when they when they get offended amen amen many therefore of his disciples when they heard that they said this is a hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does that offend you what and if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before amen so they were offended by what he said and jesus said that offends you there is more coming there is a greater unveiling there is a greater manifestation of the word coming and you're offended by that amen amen praise the lord people are not offended by the logos but when they see the word walking on two feet that's when they are offended amen praise the lord let's stand amen so the word in flesh always offends the people it is always offensive to others when they see somebody who has lifted their position it's an offense to them hey ma'am but the bride is returning to where she originally came from amen she's coming to her position she's coming to fruition to manifestation hey man to the time where she was before the foundation of the world amen and we we saw the pharisees they had a very spiritual expectation of jesus they thought it all spiritual you know that the the the heavens would open up and there would be some great light coming down but they didn't expect the word to come to manifestation in that way so they were actually not offended by by the the divine part of christ but they were offended by the physical the natural part of christ they were offended by his flesh that was the stumbling block they liked his teaching to a point they call him the good rabbi good teacher you're a good teacher but what about your disciples what about you coming you know and healing in the sabbath you know performing miracles you know like spitting on the ground and making mud what's that all about is that part of being messiah they couldn't understand that they were offended by that and the people would say you claim to be god you know jesus never claimed to be god it's always satan who claims to be god jesus he didn't have to claim to be god he was god amen in very nature he was god paul tells us amen praise the lord so what do you see when you look through your window what do you see when you see the word in action when you see the word being materialized what do you think of it what do you think about jehovah what do you think about the creator of the universe what do you think of the god in times of brother branham what do you think of god performing his work today and the people that he chose in the flesh that he chose to dwell in amen what do you see in the last scripture psalm 119 it says i rejoice at thy word as one that findeth great spoil i hate and abhor lying thy law do i love seven times a day do i praise thee because of thy righteous judgments great peace have they which left the law and nothing shall offend them nothing shall offend them there is a people that choose not to be offended by anything that god brings their way by anything that they see you know it many times we see the word being manifested and we need to check our own thinking our own uh you know thoughts about it our own interpretation and expectations do they match the word that's why we need to always come back to the word does it match with the word amen praise the lord praise the lord for that group of people who will not be offended amen let's pray dear heavenly father we are so thankful tonight father we felt your presence father i felt your presence i felt your atmosphere being created here father because we all are creators father and the atmosphere was created in here father i believe that you are welcome here father we thank you for all that you do we thank you for all that you've done tonight father i believe that you are going to bless us even further further as we go in this life father in this world and we see the word being manifested the word coming to fruition father may we always have the mind of christ inside of us father may we always check things with the word father and recognize the word coming to fruition in our flesh father we thank you that you've chosen us before the foundation of the world for such a time as this and there is a group of people that will not be offended by the word we will not be offended because of you because of how you manifest yourself in this time father i thank you for this time that you've given us i thank you for this church i thank you for brother chad who's the pastor father may you strengthen him father strengthen the believers strengthen all of us father because we know that we are at the end time father it's drawing nigh father may we be strong father in your word in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord last brother chad to come amen thank you for being patient may the lord bless you [Music] is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh praise god i was edified by the word how about you amen may we never be one that looks out the window to criticize that the word made flesh like uh michael did when she looked she didn't want what david was rejoicing about amen but how many of you when you see the bride's revival you want to get down there and dance with david amen when you see the bride coming of christ what god is doing today how he's coming in the flesh of his bride amen and he's revealed his word and he's given the full revelation to his bride how many of you want to get down and dance a little bit with david and shout and say thank you god for eyes to see and ears to hear thank you that your word has come back to jerusalem amen remember you know as he was speaking there about john the baptist sending his disciples john was in prison and his eagle eyes filmed over and it was the issue of expectation like he said before because even john giving the prophecy had an expectation of how it would be fulfilled and jesus christ didn't match john's expectation so in prison he asked are you the one or we seek another that's why jesus said blessed is he who is not offended in me and brother branham let us know blessed is he who's not offended in the way that i come amen and the way that i fulfill the word i just like to go on record saying i'm not offended in the way he has fulfilled his promised word at the end time i'm looking out the window and i'm saying that ain't nothing but the truth that's beautiful picture that i see it's god coming in the flesh of his bride to manifest amen his plan for the end time let it warm our hearts not create an offense and if you can rejoice like david rejoice if you look out your window and you said that's a beautiful sign then that's the grace of god in our lives we should rejoice we should sing we should dance we should be happy because that's the grace of god in our lives amen may god be with you as we go and remember our brother samuel keep praying for him he's traveling from here to phoenix to preach there and then he'll be traveling back home so remember him keep him in your prayers as he's traveling around let him get back home safely and join his family amen god bless you and let's just bow our heads and pray as we're dismissed lord jesus we thank you for your word and god i pray that our eagle eye would never get filmed over lord may we never lose sight lord of what you're doing and may we never be offended in the way that you do it lord for god you have come lord and done exactly what you promised you would do and you're fulfilling it now your word is being fleshed lord fleshed out all around us god help us to rejoice in that help us to rejoice in what you're doing today we're so thankful for what you did yesterday lord without that we would never be here we're thankful for all the ways in which you manifested yourself in the ages that were previous to this age and we're so appreciative of that and so thankful for that but oh god all of that was to bring us to this and this is what warms our heart now this is what thrills our soul this is what causes us to want to shout hallelujah because we see your word restored coming back into jerusalem oh we thank you for eyes to see and ears to hear lord as we go from here this evening we pray that you would bless us and help us to walk lord the way you called for us to walk in this life god we pray that you bless a special blessing upon our brother samuel as he's traveling throughout the united states and traveling home i prayed you'd use him to minister in other places lord and bless him in his route home and may have a sweet reunion with his family and with the church there go with him and bless him lord we thank you for your word may it grow in us may it grow into greater manifestation may it grow lord and become more clear and manifest more in our flesh and may may the word lord take preeminence in us as we yield to you we love you father we pray you go with us lord
