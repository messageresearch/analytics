bless you man it's good to be here together amen and the environment we live in it's good to be here together let's take our bibles and turn to the book of james as we begin in this verse this evening thank god for the privilege to be here and may he be glorified in all we do james chapter one we'll start in the book of james chapter one and i'm gonna begin reading from verse two my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect in entire wanting nothing praise the lord so count it all joy that's the challenge amen that's the challenge let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we ask lord jesus that you would be glorified today that you would be high and lifted up lord in everything we would say and do may you have preeminence lord and take control of these lips lord to speak your words lord i pray that you would mold our hearts lord into your character that you would change us lord into your likeness that you would lift us up word by word we love you and we asked it lord that you would take control of this service now in jesus name we pray amen you can have your seats so um i just want to give you a quick update i did i was able to talk to the health department in allen county and it didn't change anything so i was hopeful but it didn't really matter much i implored i asked questions i ran scenarios and basically nothing's changed we have to wear the mask even if we're seated even if we're six feet apart from one another we still have to wear the mask in the service sunday school kids under 10 don't have to wear the mask but teachers do and the only time that the teacher's supposed to remove their mask in sunday school is if they're having trouble communicating so i don't i don't know i'm not interpreting that in any way but but anyhow that's what i was told and then also there there's an exemption for the hearing impaired whenever you're speaking to someone who's hearing impaired you can remove your mask so please if anybody's talking to brother wesley always take your mask off because he read he reads lips hey amen brother you're going to get a lot of fellowship in church amen so praise the lord if we're stuck in this situation we might as well enjoy it amen why be unhappy amen god is good also many of you might have heard that mike dewine announced today that starting tomorrow at 6 00 pm it's a statewide mass mandate so no shopping in wapawk you know it doesn't change anything now we're all in the same boat together which means the likelihood of a quick turnaround for allen county is now gone because now allen county is with the whole state so as columbus rises and falls so do we which means god is really desiring to test his children i'm convinced he's taylor made this one for us but god be praised we're going to be obedient we're going to love him anyhow we're going to praise the lord anyway man let's let's look together at first peter if we could turn over there quickly first peter chapter 1 first peter chapter 1 and verse 6 wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found in praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ so the scripture is consistent that these temptations and trials are good for us they're working a wonderful thing in our life we wouldn't ask for them we don't necessarily uh um in our human self want them to come along but god has designed it for our good and it's working something beneficial to us that we need so we say praise the lord in good times praise the lord and bad times praise the lord and all times praise the lord and i titled this today just so we can keep our thought together the danger of having it too good self-explanatory title the danger of having it too good i want to read from this quote in the united time and sign from 1963 brother brahm says speaking of tension i was praying about it this morning what would you do if you didn't have tension just think of it tension is part of living that kind of encouraged me when i thought that if you had no tension you'd be like a ragdoll you wouldn't have no feelings there would be nothing you could work on like a husband and wife maybe if she wants to do something and they're trying to work together especially christians and the other one once and and when when you come together you find out what she's done she finds out see the tension really brings you closer together and somebody tells you that well said just think of that little wife that went under a lot of tension when you wasn't so good or the husband went under 10 under some tension when you wasn't so good then when it's all forgiven look how you feel about him my you you just see you just got to have tension that's all and just think if feelings what if you didn't have any feelings no pains or nothing what if there be no pain at all you'd have no feelings at all see and if you had no feeling then one of your senses would be gone see so see everything's just right anyhow so god just give us grace to stand up to it that's the thing if i just stand up with that grace and stand there and say we know that when this life is over the great one's on the other side where we're looking to go to and now we remember that all these things that's a tension that some people tries to introduce christianity that you're free from worry you're not no you're not he said you're free from tension oh no you add tension when you become a christian because you was kind of a slop go happy go lucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did but when you become a real christian every moment you're wondering am i pleasing my lord if i could hear from him it puts you on tension puts you on guard that's what makes you what you are so after all tension is a blessing so god creates situations that create more tension because it's a blessing tension is a blessing it's just the way you're looking at it it's just the way you're looking at it see if you just look the other side no matter how thin you slice anything you've still got two sides to it you see so you want to see both sides so tension i think oh my what's this tension if i could have been born without this tension well if i would have had if i wouldn't have had this tension i wouldn't have been what i am i wouldn't have been a christian perhaps it was this tension that drove me to jesus christ see it's been a blessed it's been a blessing thing in my life this is the prophet who suffered from nervous tension for much of his life and he really really suffered and he was saying here in 1963 that he's saying this tension is a blessing in my life it's the thing that drove me to jesus christ is the thing that creates desperation in life amen god god loves us so much that he doesn't i would say this way god doesn't spoil his children you know i've seen spoiled children and many of you have and and spoiled children always hate their parents they're always fussing and fighting with their parents they're never happy they're never satisfied they never have joy amen any joy that they have because a parent gives in to him is only temporary and it turns into frustration very quickly amen and spoiled children are never satisfied they're never happy and they're never at peace with mom and dad amen but children who have been brought up difficult and rough and and sparingly and not been spoiled they love mom and dad they're happy they're content i mean they can be happy with a stick i mean they can play games with a bottle cap and then they they can become joyful they become happy and so god will not spoil his children because god wants to maintain the right relationship with us if you look at what's happening in the government now there's been such a a spoiling of the american citizen by the u.s government trying to provide everything in fact you know when this thing first came down they want to give everybody extra money everybody get to check for nothing you did nothing but you get a check they want to give out another round of checks amen and the people that they're sending checks to are the people that's trying to topple over monuments and spray paint state houses and why because spoiled children hate their parents and are never happy can you imagine the original americans looking at what's going on now they would be dumbfounded amen the the americans nowadays have more than they ever had back then but the one thing they're lacking is character they have money they have jobs and cars houses stimulus checks but no character and in in power without character is satanic so god is going to make sure that his bride's going to have character because he's given his bride the word and the unfolding of the word brings power the revelation brings power and god is not going to give her the power of his word amen until she's got the character to handle it so god's going to make sure we go under tension we're not going to be spoiled children he's not going to give and give and give so we can turn around and shake our fist and his face and say we want more but god is going to make sure that we have enough trials enough troubles enough difficulties enough failures enough tension so that every portion we get we're grateful for every new morsel that comes every meal we say thank you amen how many children sit down at breakfast lunch and supper three meals a day that mom fixed and put on the table and how many still say thank you mom thank you for lunch thank you for suffering it becomes so routine we forget amen and we can do the same thing with god it becomes so routine so expected that we begin to forget amen how precious it is for god to give revelation how beautiful it is for god to give his word what a wonderful thing it is amen to be able to worship him in spirit and in truth so god makes sure that we learn the lesson the right way and at the end of the day we're thankful when we look back on a life that's had troubles it's not been smooth all the way there's been difficulties there's been losses there's been rejections there's been separations there's been highs and there's been lows and but you look back and you needed god and god brought you through this and he brought you through that and he brought and all it does is build a greater gratitude and love in your heart for god if it had been smooth all the way through and no trouble and and no pressures and no difficulties no disappointments no tears no anguish amen we wouldn't have the same level of gratitude and so when these things come like they're coming now and like we'll be coming in the future amen these things are good for us let's turn to the book of isaiah remember we're looking at the danger of having it too good isaiah 14. isaiah 14 and verse 12 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer's son of the morning howarth thou cut down to the ground which has weakened the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit let's turn from here over to ezekiel 28. ezekiel 28 and verse 12. ezekiel 28 and 12 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and send him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the son full of wisdom and perfect in beauty brother graham says this is a description of lucifer thou sealest up the psalm full of wisdom and perfect in beauty now i want you to look at the condition that lucifer is in full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was like covering the sardis topaz and the diamond the barrel the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabernacle and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou has walked up and down in the midst of stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast his profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the oak covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee that was defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth and the sight of all them that behold thee all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shall be a terror and never never shalt thou be anymore so lucifer we find out brother of them tells us he talks about it many places lucifer was one of the covering cherubs as we found out here in ezekiel and god had said him so he was full of wisdom and perfect in beauty but but although he was perfect and i would also say it this way lucifer was highly revelated lucifer knew the word of god he he was there in the act of creation he he saw what was going on he was a covering cherub he was as close to god as you could get and he was designed to be full of wisdom and perfect in beauty and god made him i mean he was called lucifer lucifer means light bearer he was a light bearer so he was a carrier of the word he was a light bearer that means the shine or the morning star he was the son of the morning or son of the dawn or the sun from the beginning so he was he was he was perfect the bible says he was perfect the bible said he was full of wisdom not that he was lacking any he was full of wisdom and perfect in beauty by being full of wisdom and perfect in beauty and being as close to god as you could get amen he had it all good everything was good but he had it so good that the perfection in him corrupted him by all of his merchandise there was iniquity found in him there was violence in him amen in in his heart verse 17 the heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness or thy splendor so he was i would say it this way he was too good his splendor and his brightness it corrupted him his wisdom amen it perverted him he had it so good he wasn't content with the full of wisdom and perfect and beauty that he had he wanted to ascend above the stars of heaven he wanted more he didn't have enough he wanted more he wanted to be exalted he wanted to be like the most high he was next to the most high mother verb said his right hand man equal to god co-equal to god in all ways except for creation so you couldn't get much better than this but but in all that perfect world full of wisdom perfect in beauty i mean the tabrets and the pipes and everything that he had amen all the perfection was able to turn to corruption within him and so it's not necessarily being close to perfect will solve the problem sometimes the closer you get to perfect it makes it worse having it easy having it perfect that not not necessarily going to solve the problem so lucifer amen was corrupted and and look at the destruction that will come from lucifer in verse 18. thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy trapping therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee lucifer is going to be destroyed within himself it looks to me like a self-destruction and this is what happens to people you you see all the time it's so good everything's so good everything's so perfect amen and they have a meltdown within themselves and they throw their whole life away they destroy themselves from within themselves and god is going to allow the same thing to happen to lucifer he's going to there's going to be a fire within the midst of him that will destroy him he has no character i'd say it like this if i could just put in my words he has everything but character he had power he had wisdom he had beauty he had authority but he had no character in the in the message the true vine and the false vine brother ram says now look at cain he came with sincerity but look in the background his daddy the devil he was influenced by his daddy the reason in heaven when he was up there he set up a kingdom more beautiful more elaborate pretty than what michael's was he tried to get a greater kingdom that's why he was kicked out pride beauty stuck up and when he come here there was a nature of him right in this boy and it hasn't died yet you believe that nature hasn't died yet it's in humanity always trying to do better have pride but but i want to think about when i look at this i think about what was michael's kingdom like if lucifer could do one better i wonder if even in the heavenly realms if michael i'm just wondering if michael's kingdom couldn't have still been humble even in the heavenly realms it was humble in such a way that lucifer was sure he could make one better and sirs we would see jesus brother says god doesn't live in glamour god lives in humility glamour comes from satan he lives in humility when he was here on earth he became the humblest among men the poorest among men who who was it wanted glamour satan he wanted his kingdom greater than michael's so he set it up in the north tried to outshine it son of the morning he says in christ is the mystery of god revealed notice lucifer in the last days is doing as he did it first what did lucifer do the first thing that lucifer done to separate the fellowship of god and man he wanted to build him a united kingdom a greater splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater kingdom than michael christ had you got it now now if you miss it just hold up your hand i'll say it again you see lucifer at the beginning his purpose and heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than christ had is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more splendor than the kingdom of christ that's amazing that means that the kingdom of christ this is i'm just going to put in my words just let me explain it the way i understand it i may be wrong but if that's possible it looked like the splendor of christ hadn't been maxed out on beauty and splendor that somehow god had made the the the kingdom of michael the kingdom of christ still in humility to where it wasn't maxed out to the top where lucifer was confident he could do one better because god is known in humility god is not known in glamour god is known in humility so it's amazing how everything started in heaven the war broke out in heaven and moved down to earth and continues on today and it's really the same thing that we're fighting with amen it was satan our lucifer was really battling within himself his perfection and his beauty and his wisdom was corrupting him from within and he could not because he had no character could not look at the beauty of humility humility didn't look right to him and he could do better than the humble kingdom of christ so he went about to do better amen and he wasn't satisfied with the portion that god gave him for he said i will build my kingdom on the side and my throne on silent i will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven i will be like the most high and the battle goes right back to the same one we've always had self-will versus the will of god he wasn't satisfied with his portion and his portion was beautiful we can we can fall into the same lot if we're not careful god has given us so much but let's not let the so much he's given us corrupt us but let god amen in his own way of dealing with his children bring enough tension and enough trials and enough pressure and enough heartache and enough disappointment amen to build in us the character amen to match the beauty of the word that he's given to us and the position he's put us in god has a desire to exalt his bride but he will not let his bride fall like lucifer fell so he will never exalt us amen above the character he's instilled in us to handle the position he puts us so the word has painted a picture of where the bride belongs and brother ben has told us our position in christ we know that position is done it's sealed before the foundation of the world we were in him we were in his mind we were positionally placed in the mind of god amen and that position is absolutely secure but god is allowing us now in a body of flesh to be subject to things upon this earth that does not match our spiritual position and if we try amen to if we try to circumvent the natural circumstances we're in by claiming our spiritual position amen we're going to exalt ourselves above measure beyond the place that god has allowed us to attain to yet you understand god is building us up by faith he's increasing us more and more and more we're already there we've already arrived it's a finished work we're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus but god is working on some character right now and we have to let him work on the character amen and not just claim my spiritual position and ignore all the things he's trying to do to build character and humility in my life amen so that as he lifts me the degree by degree by degree i can handle the position and the authority and the power of the word so i say praise be to god whatever comes praise be to god and you know my initial reaction many times is to begin to grumble and complain amen and it takes a little while sometimes to subdue the flash and remember this is a good thing if it is cross god's desk if he has signed off on if he's authorized this trial then this is a good thing for me and if god has not authorized this trial then then something is happening outside of his will for my life and now i'm not secure in my position in him you realize it's either he authorized it or he didn't if he didn't then where does that put us so if we're secure in our position in him then he's authorized to trial let's turn to jude i want to look at i just want to look at the approach and attitude and spirit of michael we see quite a bit in the scriptures about lucifer and there's not a lot of scriptures about michael but i want to look at this one in jude chapter 1 verse 8. jude chapter 1 verse 8. likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuked thee now the reason i read that is because we're looking at michael who has character we know michael has character amen and michael in his character when he begins when the devil begins to dispute with him over the body of moses he doesn't go off on him he doesn't give him what for amen he doesn't even bring a railing accusation amen and who better knows the character and life of lucifer who better knows the devil than michael they fought a war in heaven amen the war in heaven spelled out on earth and now they're here disputing over the body of moses but he would not even bring a slanderous accusation against him and he knew the character of the devil but he said the lord rebuked you i'm not dealing with you i'm not accusing you i'm not saying anything evil of you the lord rebuke you the lord deal with you but somehow we can feel justified in ourselves because we know the word and we know evil we know the devil and we speak we can speak things about the devil that michael wouldn't speak about the devil do you understand what i'm saying sometimes we get ideas that we call the devil names and we we say we're stomping on the devil and but we take an attitude it's an attitude friends that doesn't mean that the devil's not going to be placed satan will not be placed under her feet but who's placing him under her feet amen it says the god blessed be the god of all peace that will bruce satan shortly under your feet who's doing the bruising under your feet it's god who's doing it it's the power of god doing it it's not and it's not it's not uh it's not angry it's words it's not contentious railing accusations coming out of the bride that'll put satan under her feet amen it doesn't matter what's coming out of your mouth you can say all kinds of angry things and get all worked up and sweating stomp all over the pulpit but that's not changing anything it's the god of peace amen who's bruising satan under your feet [Music] so so if michael disputing over the body of moses i mean who was it that sent michael down to get the body of moses but god himself he was there on an errand for god he was there in obedience to the word he was there in his post of duty and the devil shows up and starts disputing with him over this body amen and he doesn't even bring a railing accusation he just says the lord rebuked him you know what makes us think if we take that same spirit that somehow if we start calling the devil names and say stuff like the devil's stupid come on how childish is that right how do you really think when lucifer was full of wisdom that the devil's stupid we only say that to make ourselves feel better to make ourselves feel powerful in our own human expression and our own human mind but the reality is the lord deal with you i'm not going to say anything because maybe god is letting you do this right now maybe the lord is letting you afflict me i'm not going to bring a railing accusation i'm not going to call you names i'm not going to spit fire at you i'm not gonna i'm not i'm just gonna say the lord deal with you i'm in the hands of my god and don't worry the lord will deal with him we don't have to worry about it so so you know it has a lot to do with attitude and it's easy to take the human nature and not the nature of christ but we have to subdue that human nature and that's a wrestling match that we all have every day of our lives is to subdue the flesh amen subdue that natural that natural spirit amen to let the holy spirit have free reign that the life of christ come out so we see the nature of michael here brother bram says in message conference with god now my catholic brother and also many of my proudest protestants i'm not hurting you but when you try to make jesus a little lesser god than god make him a lesser god you cut his feet off bring him down just a little bit under the head of god and make him a lesser god you're so wrong jesus was man he called himself the son of man that was a death blow to the devil the devil's high built himself a kingdom more beautiful than michael's cain his son wanted to make a pretty altar all out of fruits and things god doesn't dwell in that kind of beauty but god to strike the death blow to sin look how he come how did he choose to come there's a conference in heaven how are you going down how are you going to do it father said the angels there's a conference in heaven and they're asking how are you going to go down how are you going to do it father i'm going to become one of them my law of redemption is a near kinsman and i'll have to be a man myself that's the strike that knocks satan he couldn't come down with he could have come down with cherubims he could have come down the golden ladders there could have been anthem sung through the heavens and he could have walked to the earth and expelled everything but when he held the conference he decided to come as a babe in isaiah 9 6 we find that unto us a child is born a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called the counselor prince of peace the mighty god the everlasting father and of his dominion there shall be no end this will be a sign unto you a babe not a god a baby look where he was born it had to be decided in the conference where he'd be born to make sure he was man he was born in a stable he chose instead of the ivory palace guard to bring him instead of an angel escort instead of rolling cherubims with the fineries of heaven he stuck himself put himself in a stable over the manure of animals the dirt and filth of the world that's how god chose to come when he come in flesh and and what gives us the idea that everything has to be nice for us where do we get the idea that god is obligated to make everything nice for us to the point that we start to get offended at god when trials start to come when we have and when we have losses when we have rejection when we we have all these things that happen in our life for our good we begin to become offended at god and question the integrity of god what right do we have amen to have everything perfect i think god wants character if he himself came in humility how does he want his bride and arrogance and pride or in humility [Music] let's look at isaiah 42. let's look at these prophecies of the christ coming isaiah 42 we'll start with verse 1. isaiah 42 and 1 behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect and whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised reed shall he not break in the smoking flack shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth look at this nature that's coming forth he's sending his elect he's sending his servant to come down but he shall not cry nor lift his voice to be heard in the street a bruised reed shall they not break and the smoking flack shall not quench look how gentle and how timid and how mild natured christ came not what man wanted in a king not what man was looking for and a great deliverer but he comes so meek and so mild and so humble and so tender amen that that the world missed what was in their midst because of the humility because satan lucifer cannot see god in humility they can only see splendor praise be to god but the bride can see him in humility let's turn over to isaiah 53. isaiah 53. verse 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before he shears his dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge and shall shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors this is how christ came this is how christ was treated this is this was the plan of god for his only begotten son and if that's how the bridegroom come to earth and humility and how the bridegroom was treated and god's plan for the bridegroom i wonder what is god's plan for the bride what is god's plan for the bride and we should we be disappointed in diverse temptations and manifold temptations or should we begin to rejoice now amen because because if this is the way the bridegroom was on earth and this is the way he was treated and he was afflicted and and he was rejected and and he was unknown and he had no beauty that we should desire him what about his humble little bride amen because he's got to have a bride that matches his character he's got to have a bride that's a compliment to him amen and his bride you know we know the bride is beautiful the bride is is tremendous because it's god's chosen but her beauty may not be in what we consider beauty but it might be the beauty of humility that matches the humility of christ and brother brahm wasn't just joking when he said the way up is down it was a concept it was a reality it was a truth that that i myself want to be more comfortable with that the way up is down amen amen he that is a base in due time shall be exalted amen just just lower brother said if you want to see how i even go see how little you can become just be nothing amen be absolutely nothing and let god make what he wants out of us so in this life amen in this life the goal is not to be special the goal is to be nothing because god's going to do something special with nothing god's going to do something wonderful with nothing he's going to take nobody and do what only he can do let's go to second corinthians second corinthians chapter 12. i wonder sometimes if the word made flesh has always been crucified that's right the word made flesh has always been rejected it's always been cast away it's always come in humility it's always been low to the standard of the world it's always been ignorant to the wisdom of the world like in noah's day they had scientific proof that noah's message was wrong noah looked ignorant he looked foolish he looked childish in believing what he believed because they had scientific data they had instruments brother bannon said that could shoot the moon and see that there was no water up there and so the word made flesh and every day was rejected kicked around uh belittled it was it was treated badly every time so if we are the word made flesh what is our expectation in this day are we expecting a smooth ride and an acceptance from all a lifted up and put on a pedestal nothing bad ever happening i think if we have that expectation we have the wrong expectation christ learned obedience by the things he suffered christ is in you how are you learning obedience the same way let's look at second corinthians chapter 12 verse 5. of such a one i will glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities for though i would desire to glory i should not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure verse 7 is the love of god expressed verse 7 is the grace of god to the apostle paul because the apostle paul was given an abundance of revelation for lest i should be exalted about measure through the abundance of the revelation why did lucifer had abundance of revelation but what did paul get in god's love that lucifer didn't get paul got a thorn in a flesh an affliction that would abase him and keep him needy and dependent on god and keep him humbled that's one thing god did not give to lucifer so what would be greater to be in lucifer's position as an archangel perfect in beauty amen full of wisdom perfect in beauty with the taberns and the and the and the and the pipes and everything so perfect and so wonderful or would it be better to be paul afflicted and smitten amen with a thorn in the flesh humble and dependent and needy i would say god's love expressed would be expressed in paul amen to not let paul get exalted above measure because because with the abundance of revelation comes danger so i can say it that way the abundance of revelation brings with it danger oh praise be to god so god's love for us will send a thorn in the flesh an affliction a messenger of satan to buffet us to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities verse 7 is god's grace and love to paul verse 10 is paul's correct understanding and thankfulness expressed back to god therefore i take pleasure and infirmities and reproaches and necessities in persecutions and distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong it's the opposite of what we think friends god god i would say it this way the pressure is increasing for the bride do you feel it and that's a good thing because the place that he wants to take her and the revelation he wants to give to her and the understanding that she will operate by is a very dangerous level of revelation it can be a very deadly very dangerous level of revelation amen in the position and the power that comes with that revelation that he wants to give to the bride and unlock under her is very deadly and the only way that god can unlock more is when he brings the affliction and the reproach and the necessities necessary to mold the character so that the the character rises to a level that god can unlock more so we keep praying for more revelation who has prayed for more revelation in the last couple of years well welcome to the show right we prayed for more revelation but but god cannot i mean god has predestinated this bride not to fall he must ensure that she will not fall god had predestinated the apostle paul and to the work that the apostle paul was going to do there was no one else that could do that job so god had to get the apostle paul into a place where god could give him an abundance of revelation but that that abundance of revelation would not corrupt paul and the only way that he could give him such revelation on the word was to bring such affliction in need and reproach that paul would not get lifted up no matter how much revelation god poured on because paul could not exalt himself because he was so abased god's love to paul and his affliction was better was a better love than he had the lucifer in his perfection amen i say god i thank you for what you're doing i thank you lord it's it it's put a put me in it's put me in a straight it's put me in contention it's put me in distress and i thank you for it lord i needed it let's go to isaiah chapter 6. how many believes god's going to unlock more of his word for us [Laughter] you just said it you just did it if he's going to then he's going to have to unlock more troubles trials pressures because it's only in humility and of a contrite spirit and humility and brokenness that god can give such authority and power isaiah 6 1 in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims and one had six swings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried unto thee another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me for i am a man undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts so isaiah's revelation amen did not exalt isaiah isaiah's revelation abased isaiah because when isaiah saw the holiness of god and the holy worship of the seraphims he realized that he was nothing and that he was unclean a man of unclean lips and he was abased by the revelation and here's what brother brahm says in the message influence from 63 let's think he with two wings he had over his face in the presence of god humility or reverence and secondly he had two wings over his feet what was it in humility and third he flew with them but but put himself in action he put himself in action with two wings while two more wings covered his face in reverence two wings covered his feet humility two wings he was in action what was he doing he was showing the prophet by this he was showing the prophet how his prepared servants must be god god prepared service must be reverent humble and in action later he preaches influence again at the end of the year he says now in closing i might use these other two wings thirdly he could fly with these other two wings watch face covered by the holiness of god and in reverence his feet covered in humility and with two wings he could put himself in action to move god was showing his prophet how a prepared servant ought to be quit looking at uzziah here is your example i've set before you cover your face and reverence cover your feet in humility and go into action oh what an example he had looked at uzziah so long and seen it fail now god is telling him what to do show him a prepared servant he went into action so god through the vision was showing isaiah isaiah had watched uzziah but uzziah could not keep himself in humility isaiah was lifted up because he was king and when he was lifted up as king he thought he could transgress the word of god he thought that god had blessed him so much that he had risen to such a level his kingdom was such his blessing was such he was chosen of god placed of god amen he was defended by god and he was blessed by god so much that he thought he could transgress the word and he could go in and offer incense which only the priest could do and god is no respecter of person no matter how much uziah was chosen no matter how much he was placed no matter how much he was blessed as soon as he transgressed the word of god he was smitten with leprosy and isaiah had watched the blessings of uzziah the king the the anointed of god the place of god and he'll watch these blessings and he was he was really just following along with uzziah but he saw uzziah fail in humility and in reverence so god opens up a window in heaven and shows him amen in heaven he shows the lord high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and he sees the seraphims amen the holy seraph as brother benham said that had never sinned before god is so holy that the sinless creatures in heaven that worship him have to cover their face in huma and reverence and their feet and humility and he said he showed them in reverence and in humility and in action see the action doesn't work unless there's reverence in humility a prepared servant of god must be reverent humble and in action and sometimes we think all the works that we do amen are the things that matter but the action was the third part the reverence and humility was the first we've got to get reverence and humility first and then get into action that's god's plan but human beings just like lucifer has such a trouble cain had such trouble it's amazing that god when when god was going to bring his word he was going to bring a deliverance he was going to bring his children out of egypt amen he already had a chosen vessel named moses and moses was the chosen vessel of god and moses was raised with all the education with all the understanding with all the wealth and blessing of egypt as a son to pharaoh but god allowed that for a reason amen and with all that wisdom and with all that power amen he could do nothing for the kingdom of god he tried he put forth an effort he was rejected he ran away defeated into the wilderness and he and he left egypt defeated he left he left egypt rejected and dejected and for 40 years god worked to strip all that out of him i think god let it get put in him so god could strip it out of him so moses could realize that's not going to work 40 years of of the best education the the the best food the best military training the best of everything science and literature the best of everything produced nothing for god although he was the right man and the right season amen but he was using worldly wisdom and it didn't work so god let him go as rejected into the wilderness until moses got to the place where he he believed himself to be so incapable that when god come down in a burning bush through a supernatural encounter and spoke to him directly and said go he was so convinced he couldn't do it that he that he began to argue with god maybe you can say send somebody else oh god no not me send somebody else i can't do it i can't speak they won't listen to me he had he had so many excuses because god had finally got him to where he wanted him to be he was a base he knew he was worthless he knew he was incapable so what was the rejection in the wilderness journey about it was the getting to that place right there god wasn't not building up his self-esteem in the wilderness he wasn't building up his prestige and his wisdom and he wasn't building any of that he was breaking him down to humility amen to where he became a simple herder and god took him when he was low and incapable and unable and he marched him right back into the same place he was before and he left in his strength he left and he left capable and able to do something he came back completely incapable and unable to do anything and when he got to that place god put into into his servant's hands the spoken word of god the power to create where there was nothing before and then by moses through moses and in moses god did acts upon the earth amen that the earth had not seen and he delivered them with a mighty hand using moses using moses mouth using moses's body but not when moses was strong but when moses was weak and god would take that man and pour such an abundance of revelation into him that he would write the old testament he would write the law he would write the word that would set the stage for 4 000 years of judaism and then when it was time to write the new testament he did the exact same thing he took the apostle paul who was raised up a jew raised up a pharisee among pharisees of the tribe of benjamin raised up in the school of gamaliel he had everything going for him as a jew he had i mean he had prestige amongst the priests he had camaraderie amongst the priests he he was given letters from the high priest he had everything he needed to be everything that he wanted to be for the kingdom of god and god allowed it to go in just like moses the old testament and new testament pattern one another one's a shadow of the other and here comes the apostle paul he's moving down zealous to do something in his strength and then his power with his connections and his intellect do something for god and god strikes him down he meets the pillar of fire he's blinded and he's a based and now he goes blind led by the hand into the city into a house waiting for somebody that the very person he came to arrest the very ones he came to persecute and arrest and throw in the prison now he's got to be so humble the very one he on his high horse came to arrest and thrown in jail is the very one god's going to send to lay hands on him so he can receive his sight and speak to him commandments of the word of the lord and then he was going to go out into the desert in arabia and in the desert god was not building him up god was stripping him down and then when paul finally believed he knew nothing he gave up all his ability his prestige his connections god used him to write the new testament see god doesn't work the way man works god will take what's exalted and he'll bring it low so he can use it because he can't use it up here he can only use it down here he brought moses down here he brought the apostle paul down here and when it was broken and it was humbled and it was humiliated he was ready to use it when god in the old testament he he worked through moses that way but when it came time to announce when there was time for a forerunner to come to announce that christ was coming upon the earth amen he did it different this time he took somebody amen the john the baptist and sent him to the wilderness when he was a boy and did not let him get an education did not let him get indoctrinated did not let him learn culture or civilization or nothing he was raised in the wilderness because god needed a clean slate because he had such a job to do he had to come not knowing anything ignorant amen unlearned incapable amen no religious training no nothing and god could take that humble creature that was was clothed in camel's hair eating locust and honey and in humility he would become the forerunner and announcer of the coming of christ to earth so if that's the old testament pattern what do you think the new testament pattern is when it came time for for another forerunner amen god would take a a would take a man out of the hills of kentucky amen one of the most laughed at places in the united states one of the most backwards dejected and rejected places in the united states amen there's a lot of jokes told about that area he wouldn't let him get a formal education but his education was cut short no religious training whatsoever you see the pattern old testament new testament because what was he doing he was announcing his coming and god would take utter humility no seminary training no connections in the religious world no formal education no intellect no prestige no power no might no strength no nothing but ignorant and backward uncivilized amen when when finally the angel of the lord spoke to him and told him to take a gift of healing to the peoples of the world amen the prophet of god didn't even have a proper suit he pieced together a coat and a pair of pants and his coat had a rip aim and the pocket was ripped off he stitched it together himself and he was so ashamed of it he would hold his right hand over it to hide it amen and he would stick out his left hand and he would say pardon the left hand it's closer to my heart shaking his left hand it's closer to my heart and he didn't want people to see his humility and his shame and his raggedness and what was happening while he was walking in that ragged coat god was opening blinded eyes he was healing the sick lepers were being delivered amen he was doing miracle pulling miracle eight days straight amen i mean where there's thousands and thousands and thousands of healings amen and god uses something so humble so ignorant so broken so unconnected to do the most marvelous things that we have in recorded history i don't think we're ready yet i think god is making us ready i think god is going to continue to strip all self away self will self desire self respect self dependency self-esteem i think god's going to continue and i just say it for me i want to go willingly i want to make this process as easy as possible i want to humble myself i want to abase myself i don't want god to have to turn up the temperature amen to get me where i need to be because i believe i'm one of them i believe beyond a shadow of a doubt i'm one of them i believe god's going to do a work and i'm here for that work i believe it but god's got to get the character to match the work [Music] and i want to say right now lord i lay my life down i surrender all i do not want to have self-esteem self-will self-pride i don't want to have self-sufficiency i don't want anything of self i am nothing i know i'm nothing i'm incapable i'm unable i have nothing to offer i have nothing that you can use i don't have wisdom i don't have a strength i don't have money i don't i have nothing that you want nothing that i can do to help you along all i have is this vessel and i give it to you god is god is going to use these circumstances to get us where we need to be but let's just be willing willing to fall upon the stone and be broken again and fall upon the stone and be broken again and fall upon the stone and be broken again look at what god uses you have lucifer and michael look at the attitude of lucifer look at the attitude of michael you have cain and abel look at the attitude of cain and look at look at abel abel was replaced with seth seth line became herdsmen brother bram said simple simple herdsmens cain's lines became manufacturers amen makers of music and cities and manufacturing and metals in science and learning look at the difference between pharaoh and moses when moses came marching back into egypt look at the difference between jesus and caiaphas you see which side do you want to be on i say i'll take the lowly side i'll take the humble side the base side the side that has nothing can do nothing can offer nothing that's the side that i want to be on like seth and the herdsmen not cain and the brilliant ones who figured everything out so wise that they could build a tower unto heaven i would rather be like seth lyon the little herdsman who's just content hurting the flock and taking care of my family just content with the portion god gave me michael was content with the portion god gave him lucifer was not content with his portion no matter how great a magnificent a portion it was it was a greatest portion in heaven outside of michael's and he wasn't content with it i said god help me let's turn to philippians chapter 3. philippians chapter 3. and verse 4 i'll say it this way if we can't say it today with an honest heart i'm nothing i know nothing i can do nothing in my flesh i have nothing that i can offer him that'll do him any good that'll improve him any if we can't say that now i believe by the time this is over we will be able to say that philippians chapter 3 verse 4 though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he had whereof he might trust in the flesh i more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law of pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain into the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to apprehend it but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if any and if anything you be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless where do we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing even and even in the area you've already attained have the same mind that you're pressing on that you're growing more that you're pressing towards the mark of the high calling in christ that you've not already arrived i've arrived in the plan of god i've arrived in the perfection of god but god in this life has me still on the journey of perfection getting my character to where he wants it to be to do what he wants to do in this life and i say god let me be like paul let me count everything but lost that i might win you that i might just win you we'll look at two more scriptures as we close let's go to matthew 18. matthew 18 1 at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except you be converted and become as little children you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven now we've got god's idea on it this is what christ thought the disciples were in many places in the scriptures they're arguing amongst themselves who will be greatest and who will have this position who will sit on the right hand and who will sit on the left when he comes into his kingdom and they had no idea what sacrifice it was going to take for him to come into that kingdom they had no idea what they were even really talking about they had felt good because they were with them they were in the campaigns they saw the miracles they they had passed out the bread that was broken they they had they had been part of the two by two that were sent out and they had saw miracles and demons cast out and they were just enthused and excited about being part of this ministry amen and so they began the the question who's the greatest and how do we know and and you know why do you ask the question who's the greatest unless you think one of them might be eating like you're a contender do you understand when you know you're nothing you don't even care i mean everybody else is greater than me so why even ask the question true humility doesn't is not concerned with who's on top who's the greatest one who's the most revelated who has the best understanding i mean who who has the best life when you're the lowest you're not even in contention so it's not even a question in your mind you know you know that you're in the bottom half of the bottom half so who's the greatest well it's going to be one of them out there but see the the whole debate was because they thought that possibly they were a contender for top place and so jesus in his wisdom he mean he gives them a lesson they'll never forget he brings a little child along and he puts a little child in their midst he said unless you humble yourself and become like one of these little children you shall not even see the kingdom don't even worry about who's greatest if you can't humble yourself and be like this child you won't even see it whosoever can humble themselves themselves and be like a child they shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven where do you think brother branham gets the statement the way up is down right out of the scriptures the way up is down to become like a little child innocent submissive trusting believing just taking the word at face value just taking what he said and believing and standing on it and not reasoning and not figuring it out amen the little child doesn't figure out amen if daddy tells him something he believes that he's going to do it and he doesn't have to reason it out and he doesn't have to figure out how it's going to happen if daddy said it daddy means it's going to happen we need to be like little children without malice without contention without our own wisdom injected see there's two sides to us friends there's the god side in the human side and i think sometimes we try to make the human side equal to the god side and we say things uh sometimes we say things in a way to where i think that it's possible that we can corrupt ourselves with our own wisdom and our own revelation like we understand where we came from and where we're going we understand the plan of god from before the foundation of the world all the way through to the end we've been given illumination and we've got a certain brightness a certain splendor in revelation but paul was able to say i've not yet attained i've not yet apprehended that which but i'm apprehended by i don't think paul was talking about the spiritual side he's talking about the flesh side and see we can say things in such a way that we can be corrupted by our own splendor and our own brightness and not realize that there's areas in our lives that don't match the word and somehow because i know where i came from and i know where i'm going it's okay like there's areas of compromise and areas of ungodliness and there's areas that that don't match the scripture and but because we are so revelated have such an understanding amen and we believe we're children of god where we came from where we're going that somehow that these things can go unchecked in our lives and it's okay i say let's not be corrupted by our own brightness if anything let the brightness shine down inside and say lord let the brightness of your word expose all my bads don't let me use the brightness of your word to cover my bads but let the brightness of your word expose expose the pride expose the arrogancy amen expose the the lies that i tell myself to expose the hypocrisy sometimes we want the light to shine out but i want the light to shine in night the bright light of revelation to shine in because i don't believe revelation came to cover my error in a way that i don't have to deal with it and just ignore but i believe the revelation came to lift me up into a higher plane to live the very life that jesus christ lived i believe that's the purpose of revelation to bring us into a place where it's not us it's him it's not my dues it's not it's not my efforts it's him i surrendered all but i'm not going to keep pretending that i'm pretending that but let the light shine until i can come to reality with where i am lord i need you in this area of my life lord i need help in this lord i need you to root this out of me this is not pleasing to you god i need you i'm not going to use my splendor to allow corruption to grow and i keep hidden something that i need to be exposing lucifer was corrupted by his brightness by his wisdom by his perfection and say god let me not be corrupted amen but let me be ground down to nothing and rebuilt by your revelation let me humble myself as a child and be honest i've seen so many things that trouble me in myself outside myself so many times justifications for actions are given with a religious tone with a quote misused to justify my own willful desire we've seen it we've all seen it we've all experienced it we've probably all tried to do it if we just be honest with ourselves find a justificati you know i i really have a desire for this and i have a desire to do that and if i could just find a quote when we know in ourselves it's not what god wants but let the word lord expose me and root out all selfishness and all of self i want to base myself i want to become like that little child and be honest lord and be truthful praise god i think sometimes i think what i've seen sometimes is sometimes people become more dogmatic in the message to cover the own rottenness on the inside more dogmatic and make everybody else around them feel like an unbeliever point out flaws and point out this off the word and point out this sometimes i want to say brother quit pointing out everybody else's fault let's talk about yours for a while you've got such brightness that you can see flaws anywhere you've got a gift now let's use that gift on you for a few minutes and then all of a sudden the whole attitude changes i don't want that to be me if i ever do a fault-finding trip i want to do it right in my own heart and whatever i find i want to lay it before the lord and say god i need some help with this this doesn't match your word this isn't pleasing to you this is not what you want amen what kind of bride is he looking for one that's just like the bridegroom brother brenham said he talked about he went to that pentecostal meeting and the pastor was talking to him and all of a sudden the pastor introduced his wife and she said she had bob tear all painted up jewelry on and all this stuff and he said i i can't remember the exact words that he used but he said i thought you said your wife was a saint said she looks more like a hate and brother branham could judge that man by his wife because brother brown tells us in choosing a bride the kind of woman that a man will choose reflects what kind of character is on the inside so what kind of bride is christ choosing he's choosing a bride that reflects the character that's on the inside of him christ could come in utter humility he could come as a baby and a manger born over a manure pile god would he come in flesh that way he could come in such simplicity and such humility and jesus could be ill-spoken of and not speak evil back he could be smitten and not smite back amen he could subdue himself he could subdue his own nature and then he could humble himself and if he can do that his bride can do it too if he can live in humility if he could surrender his will amen to the plan of god then his bride can do it the same way if he can go through gethsemane then his bride can go through gethsemane as well if he could stand there and be crucified for to fulfill the word of god and the will of god his bride can stand and be crucified too i said god that's the life i want to live let's go to first corinthians i want to finish with this scripture first corinthians chapter 1. first corinthians 25 or chapter 1 and verse 25. musicians you can go ahead and make your way up and brother ben if you could come first corinthians 1 and 25 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brother and how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty many noble are called but god has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised have god chosen yea and things which are not to bring them not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth led him glory in the lord lord let's all stand the scripture says he's chosen the foolish things of the world who wants to be foolish now he's chosen the weak things of the world who wants to be weak now you see if god wants to take the weak the foolish the rejected the downcast the nobodies so that no flesh can glory in his presence so that he can do a work through nothing then my goal is to be nothing my goal is to be foolish in the eyes of the world to be weak in the eyes of the world to be nothing because if i can become that then that's the very thing that he's looking for to show himself mighty and to do his work through so if we believe romans 16 that the god of all peace shall brew satan shortly under your feet what kind of vessel is he looking for to brew satan under your feet he's looking for weakness humility foolishness he's not looking for somebody who's got it all figured out and knows the answer to everything he's looking for somebody who doesn't know what's coming next and how to handle it he's looking for somebody who who doesn't know what the chaos in the world is going to equal to and what we're going to do next and how we're going to make the next decision and what he's eating the right thing to do is next that's what he's looking for and so i i myself am tired of trying to have the pressure of having it all figured out i decided i'm going to become foolish next time you ask me brother chad what do you think's going to happen next i'm going to tell you i have absolutely no idea do you think this could go this way and this could go that way sure but it may not and i don't know i have no idea all i know is he's got to figure it out i just got to keep my hand in his belittle he's big be nothing he's everything be foolish he's all wisdom i don't have to figure it out i don't have to give an answer i don't have to pretend to know all i have to know is him and i have to have the character to match his character and if i do he'll plug me up and do great things through nothing like he did with moses like he did with paul like he did with brother brethren like he did with john the baptist like he did with amos like he did with all of them look who god was looking for say lord i i want to take all my message merit badges and throw them in the trash and all my 40 years and have it figured out and know the word and i just want to throw it all away and say god i know nothing but you and anything you've revealed to me is by your grace not by my effort what you've given me you've given me by your grace and lord if i can stay low you can keep lifting me higher i can stay low you can keep lifting me higher the way up is down humility is his character jesus christ came an utter complete humility his bride is able to humble herself and if she's not convinced of that yet he'll make sure he'll make sure that by the time we're out of here that the same character that jesus christ had will be displayed in his bride and i just want to lay my life down and let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for this day we thank you lord for every trial every obstacle for all the tension lord god in the last short while the last several months lord you've begun to unravel our wisdom our resolve our strength you begin to expose lord our selfishness and our pride god i'm thankful for that lord i pray you'd forgive us lord that we can humble ourselves before you and admit our own say we were too proud lord we were too self-sufficient too confident in our own selves [Music] but god we want to become like
