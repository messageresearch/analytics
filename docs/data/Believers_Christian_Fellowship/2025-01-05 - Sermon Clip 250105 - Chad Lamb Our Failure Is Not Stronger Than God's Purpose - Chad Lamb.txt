========================================

why didn't he stop the Fall In the Garden of Eden he could stop anything he stopped all kinds of people from making mistakes he has put the brakes on he's changed circumstances he stopped why didn't he stop the Fall In the Garden of Eden Hey listen I don't know about you but I'm suffering because of that decision the whole world is suffering every human that's ever been on this Earth is suffering because of what happened in the Garden of Eden we're under a curse we're burned under a curse we live all of our lives in a cursed body amen all because of something that happened why didn't he stop it the only reason I know according to what the prophet said is that fall worked together for his purpose so God allowed it amen why did Abraham fail his wife in such a way that he would go down to Gar and lie and sell out his wife and listen brother Abraham is the chosen vessel of God Amen he is the going to be the father of Faith the father of Nations from his loin are is going to come the seed line amen all of this stuff is going on in Abraham after meeting God after a body change after all of these things he goes down to guar and he fails his wife he fails God CU he shouldn't have been down there anyways should have stayed in the land that what the prophet tells us and and all of these things transpire and then God listen God comes on the scene God comes on the scene to aimc and says' don't you know you're about to take a a man's wife he said Lord you know the Integrity of my heart I didn't why didn't God stop Abraham from going to Gar if he could show up and talk to a heathen King couldn't he have talked to Abraham how many times did he talk to Abraham if he told Abraham don't go to Gar I don't believe Abraham would have went so why did it happen this way why didn't he stop him from making a mistake why didn't he stop him from hurting Sarah's feelings why didn't he stop from bringing trouble to the whole nation of gar the whole nation was under a curse because of this thing because God had already stopped the wounds of animal and servant and everybody the whole nation was troubled because of Abraham's decision Sarah was troubled because of Abraham decision the whole promise of God looked like it was in Jeopardy because of the decision of Abraham aiman's life was in Jeopardy because of the decision of Abraham why didn't God stop Abraham from making the decision but he come to a heathen King and he said listen this whole thing's bad don't do it right all I can say friends is it must have served God's purpose and you realize we stand here and I don't know all that God was accomplishing and all that was happening amen it may take us the entire eternity to understand it but one thing I know for sure is that's the only scripture brother Brenham has to show that they had a body change right cuz brother Brenham comes to that scripture and says see that King could have any Fair young virgin he wants but he wants Grandma Sarah coming down because God had just changed their bodies in that meeting in Genesis 18 and now they come down to Guerrera that is reading between the lines that's what God placed so that a prophet could pick it up 4,000 or some years later and say see there was a body change Abraham probably never knew why God allowed that mistake in his life but we're looking back saying I'm so glad he went to Gar I'm so thankful that he went down there and all that transpired so I can see what God has in store for me was it a mistake yes was it costly yes did people suffer yes
