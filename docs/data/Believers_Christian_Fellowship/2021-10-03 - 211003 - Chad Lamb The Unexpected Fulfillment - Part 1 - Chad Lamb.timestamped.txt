[5:25] and you've called us
[5:27] unto that place
[5:28] by your grace lord you've drawn us
[5:31] you placed something within us before
[5:33] the foundation of the world that would

[5:44] it's a grand privilege
[5:46] god as we turn our hearts lord to your

[5:59] in the way you break the bread
[6:01] god that we might all be fed from your

[6:14] preeminence in every heart and every
[6:16] life
[6:17] may you drive away every spirit that
[6:19] would try to hinder may it be barred in
[6:22] this place
[6:23] may your holy ghost have free reign to
[6:26] move
[6:26] as you wish
[6:28] bring us up higher lord and let us see
[6:30] more clearly than we ever have before in
[6:34] jesus christ's name we pray
[6:37] amen
[6:39] and god bless you it's good to be here
[6:41] this morning
[6:42] if you could take your bibles and just
[6:43] turn to the
[6:45] book of
[6:46] matthew i'd like to look at a portion of
[6:49] scripture
[6:50] i want to say we appreciate your prayers
[6:52] praying for us while we were gone
[6:55] we had a very blessed time out in oregon
[6:57] we had a good set of meetings over the
[7:00] weekend and we were able to baptize
[7:02] sister esther the sister from california
[7:04] and so it was wonderful we met her and
[7:06] spent some time with her this evening at
[7:08] the communion service i'll share more of
[7:09] the testimony there's several details i
[7:11] want to go into what god had done was
[7:13] just amazing to me
[7:15] only god can move the pieces on a chess
[7:18] board like he does
[7:19] and it's just amazing when you watch him
[7:21] do it so i would like to share that with
[7:23] you tonight and uh we had a wonderful
[7:25] time with brother rich and sister
[7:27] charity cobb and their family they
[7:29] treated us good we just appreciate them
[7:31] inviting the whole family and making it
[7:33] possible that we could all go together
[7:36] this is one of the very few times in 14
[7:38] years of ministry that my whole family
[7:39] has got to come i think this is maybe
[7:41] the third time and so it was a real
[7:43] blessing for all of us and we enjoyed
[7:45] that
[7:46] and i'm thankful for the brothers who
[7:48] ministered here i was able to listen to
[7:50] the services and i enjoyed them
[7:52] and
[7:53] also
[7:54] that special the sister sang on sunday
[7:57] was wonderful god bless you all
[7:59] we were getting ready we were three
[8:00] hours behind so i was preparing i sent a
[8:04] little desk in the bedroom preparing
[8:07] and angie turned the service on
[8:09] blake was finishing a song and it was
[8:11] coming to the special and so i quit
[8:13] studying and i watched the special and i
[8:15] enjoyed it and that made us really
[8:17] really homesick
[8:18] so that was a bad idea
[8:21] and so then it kept playing in the
[8:23] background while i was studying and then
[8:25] brother ben started preaching and he
[8:26] kept preaching i kept listening then i
[8:28] got on my seat and i'm standing there by
[8:30] the bed watching the phone's laying on
[8:31] the bed and i said take the phone away
[8:34] and she was reached what i said wait
[8:35] wait a minute
[8:37] he said a few more things i said okay
[8:39] take the phone away
[8:40] and i said well just hold on just a
[8:41] second so finally she got the phone out
[8:44] of the room so i could go back to
[8:45] focusing on our service but
[8:47] so any of you brothers that go away
[8:49] ministering it's a bad idea to watch the
[8:51] home service
[8:52] it makes you home sick and then you just
[8:54] want to see everybody but we just
[8:56] appreciate everybody doing their part
[8:58] and everybody pulling on the word and
[8:59] all your prayers it was a real blessing
[9:02] and so we're really really happy to be
[9:04] home again and happy to have this time
[9:06] together i want to remind you the
[9:08] communion service after
[9:10] this afternoon service or for this
[9:12] afternoon service and i'll try to
[9:14] remember to remind you of that again at
[9:16] the end of service
[9:17] amen
[9:19] let's uh read matthew chapter 1
[9:22] verse 20.
[9:28] matthew chapter 1 and verse 20.
[9:35] but while he thought on these things
[9:37] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[9:39] unto him in a dream saying joseph thou
[9:41] son of david fear not to take unto thee
[9:43] mary thy wife
[9:45] for that which is conceived in her is of
[9:47] the holy ghost and she shall bring forth
[9:50] a son and thou shalt call his name jesus
[9:53] for he shall save his people from their
[9:54] sins
[9:56] now all this was done that it might be
[9:58] fulfilled which was spoken of the lord
[10:00] by the prophet saying behold a virgin
[10:03] shall be with child and shall bring
[10:04] forth a son and they shall call his name
[10:07] emmanuel which being interpreted is god
[10:09] with us
[10:10] you can be seated
[10:14] i wanted to start with this scripture in
[10:16] the part that i really want to highlight
[10:19] is that all this was done that it might
[10:21] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[10:24] lord by the prophet
[10:26] and so there were certain things that
[10:28] had to be done
[10:29] and they had to be done a certain way to
[10:32] fulfill prophecy and so now joseph
[10:35] you know with the angel visits mary and
[10:37] we'll get into that in a minute and
[10:38] gives her a commission and she receives
[10:40] a conception according to the word
[10:42] joseph now is is pondering these things
[10:44] pondering about putting her away
[10:46] privately and the angel comes to him in
[10:48] a dream and tells him what is going on
[10:50] and and telling her not to put her away
[10:53] but but that thing which is in hers of
[10:55] the holy ghost and and explaining that
[10:57] all of this had to be done to fulfill
[10:59] the scriptures
[11:01] and so i'd like to take a subject the
[11:03] lord just leading me down a thought of
[11:05] the unexpected fulfillment
[11:08] and that's always been the the trick in
[11:11] the fulfillment of prophecy is god
[11:13] always fulfills prophecy in an
[11:15] unexpected way and so we have to be
[11:18] careful to watch for the unexpected
[11:20] fulfillment
[11:22] i want to look at isaiah chapter 40 as
[11:24] we go into this
[11:28] isaiah chapter 40
[11:32] and we'll start at verse 3.
[11:40] i'm going to read several scriptures
[11:42] here back to back and then we'll go in
[11:44] uh to the thought
[11:46] in isaiah 40 verse 3 the voice of him
[11:48] that christ in the wilderness prepare ye
[11:50] the way of the lord make straight in the
[11:52] desert a highway for our god
[11:54] every valley shall be exalted every
[11:57] mountain and hill shall be made low and
[11:59] the crooked shall be made straight and
[12:01] the rough places plain
[12:03] and the glory of the lord shall be
[12:04] revealed and all flesh shall see it
[12:07] together for the mouth of the lord hath
[12:09] spoken in now just imagine that you're
[12:12] reading the book of isaiah not in
[12:15] 2021 but imagine you're reading the book
[12:18] of isaiah
[12:20] in maybe ad-10 amen or maybe or maybe
[12:23] just before the birth of christ and
[12:25] you're reading the book of isaiah and by
[12:27] reading the book of isaiah he's giving a
[12:29] prophecy of the coming of the lord but
[12:32] look at a coming of a forerunner to the
[12:34] coming of the lord but look at the
[12:36] prophecy the voice of him that christ in
[12:38] the wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[12:40] lord make straight in the desert a
[12:42] highway for our god
[12:44] amen what would you think what would you
[12:47] be looking for by reading the scripture
[12:50] if you didn't know the fulfillment we're
[12:52] standing here and we know the
[12:53] fulfillment but if you didn't know the
[12:55] fulfillment when you read this portion
[12:57] of scripture what would you be imagining
[12:59] in your mind what would you be looking
[13:01] for you would be looking for a road
[13:03] being built in the desert
[13:06] every valley shall be exalted every
[13:09] mountain and hill shall be made low well
[13:10] that makes sense because it's got to be
[13:12] a straight road so you've got to take
[13:15] down the mountains and you've got to
[13:16] fill in the valleys and make a straight
[13:18] path
[13:20] so you would instantly be looking for a
[13:23] physical fulfillment of these words
[13:28] and every valley shall be exalted every
[13:30] mountain and hill shall be made low and
[13:32] the crooked shall be made straight in
[13:34] the rough places plain
[13:36] and the glory of the lord shall be
[13:38] revealed and all flesh shall see it
[13:40] together for the mouth of the lord hath
[13:42] spoken it
[13:44] when you read that scripture not knowing
[13:46] the fulfillment but just reading the
[13:47] scripture you would be looking for
[13:49] something happening on a grand scale you
[13:51] would be looking for something massive
[13:53] something all flesh will see
[13:58] it'll be so big it'll be so mighty all
[14:00] the mountains will be flattened the
[14:01] valleys will be fed the rough place is
[14:03] smooth it'll be made a highway in the
[14:05] desert for the lord amen so he can come
[14:08] marching in triumphantly and all flesh
[14:10] shall see the glory of the lord
[14:12] you would be looking for something
[14:14] massive
[14:17] let's turn to malachi chapter 3.
[14:30] malachi
[14:32] chapter 3
[14:35] verse 1
[14:37] behold i will send my messenger and he
[14:40] shall prepare the way before me and the
[14:42] lord whom you seek shall suddenly come
[14:44] to his temple even the messenger of the
[14:46] covenant whom you delight and behold he
[14:48] shall come saith the lord of hosts
[14:51] here's another one of those prophecies
[14:53] that you would be looking at for the
[14:54] fulfillment but what would you be
[14:56] looking for amen you'd be looking for
[14:58] this to be fulfilled but how would it be
[15:01] fulfilled
[15:02] let's turn over to mark chapter 1.
[15:11] mark chapter 1
[15:14] and verse 2.
[15:21] addis is as it is written in the
[15:22] prophets behold i send my messenger
[15:24] before thy face which i'll prepare the
[15:27] way before thee
[15:28] the voice of one crying in the
[15:30] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[15:31] lord and make its path straight so
[15:33] that's referencing both scriptures that
[15:35] we just spoke about in isaiah 40 also
[15:38] malachi 3 they're both referenced here
[15:41] in verse 2 and verse 3 and it says in
[15:44] the lord make his path straight
[15:46] verse 4 john did baptize in the
[15:48] wilderness and preach the baptism of
[15:50] repentance for the remission of sins
[15:55] and there went out unto him all the land
[15:57] of judea and they of jerusalem and were
[15:59] all baptized of him in the river of
[16:01] jordan confessing their sins and john
[16:03] was clothed with camel's hair with a
[16:05] girdle of skin about his loins and he
[16:07] did eat locust and wild honey and
[16:10] preached saying there come one mightier
[16:12] than i after me the latchette of whose
[16:14] shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and
[16:17] unloose i indeed have baptized you with
[16:19] water but he shall baptize you with the
[16:23] holy ghost
[16:25] let's turn to luke chapter 3 and read
[16:27] about john as well and here luke chapter
[16:30] 3 verse 2.
[16:41] ananias and cophious
[16:43] a caiaphas being the high priest the
[16:45] word of god coming to john the son of
[16:47] zacharias in the wilderness and he came
[16:49] into all the country about jordan
[16:51] preaching the baptism of repentance for
[16:53] the remission of sins as it is written
[16:55] in the book of the words of isaias the
[16:57] prophet saying the voice of one crying
[16:59] in the wilderness prepare ye the way of
[17:01] the lord make his path straight every
[17:04] valley shall be filled and every
[17:05] mountain and hill shall be brought low
[17:07] and the crooked shall be made straight
[17:09] and the rough way shall be made smooth
[17:11] and all flesh shall see the salvation of
[17:14] god then said he to the multitude that
[17:17] came forth to be baptized of him o
[17:19] generation of vipers who hath warned you
[17:22] to flee from the wrath to come bring
[17:24] forth therefore fruits worthy of
[17:26] repentance and begin not to say within
[17:28] yourselves we have abraham to our father
[17:31] for i say unto you that god is able of
[17:33] these stones to raise up children unto
[17:34] abraham and now also the axes laid into
[17:37] the root of the trees
[17:39] every tree therefore which bringeth not
[17:41] forth good fruit is shown down and cast
[17:44] into the fire
[17:45] so now when we see we've read the
[17:48] prophecy in isaiah 40 we've read the
[17:50] prophecy in malachi 3 but now we look
[17:52] into the new testament to the
[17:54] fulfillment when this forerunner came
[17:56] when this when this messenger came
[17:59] that god promised to send when we see
[18:02] him emerge on the scene he comes out of
[18:04] the wilderness wearing a a coat of
[18:07] camel's hair and and skins wrapped
[18:09] around his loins eating locust and wild
[18:11] honey and standing on the banks of the
[18:13] river and screaming for them to repent
[18:15] amen calling them vipers and snakes and
[18:18] the axes laid to the root of the tree
[18:20] this is the fulfillment of that prophecy
[18:25] and i want to read a few things brother
[18:26] benham said about them
[18:28] in god hiding himself in simplicity then
[18:30] revealing himself in the same this is a
[18:33] message that i've been studying and this
[18:35] is where most of this is coming from in
[18:37] fact i'm just repreaching christ
[18:39] or god hiding himself in simplicity so
[18:41] if you want to know what we're going to
[18:42] talk about just go listen to that
[18:45] because i've been watching this and
[18:46] god's drawing my attention to these
[18:48] things and pulling some things out for
[18:49] me to see
[18:51] and and god hiding himself in simplicity
[18:54] and then revealing himself in the same
[18:58] he says now
[19:00] how all this spoke when it had been for
[19:02] 700 years there was to be a forerunner
[19:04] come before the messiah but when he come
[19:06] on the scene in such simplicity they
[19:09] missed him
[19:11] they were all reading the prophecies
[19:12] they were looking forward to this coming
[19:15] of this forerunner that will pave the
[19:17] way for the coming of the lord amen and
[19:19] they wanted listen they all wanted him
[19:22] to come
[19:25] because they wanted to move forward in
[19:27] prophecy so they wanted the messenger of
[19:29] the covenant to come the forerunner to
[19:31] come because they wanted the lord to
[19:33] come on the scene they wanted him to
[19:35] come and build that highway in the
[19:37] desert they wanted him to come and bring
[19:39] the mountains low and bring the valleys
[19:41] up and the crooked place is straight and
[19:42] the rough place is smooth they wanted
[19:44] him to come do that so that all could
[19:46] see the glory of the lord they wanted it
[19:49] or at least they thought they wanted it
[19:52] so they had an imaginary way that they
[19:54] thought it would come to pass and they
[19:56] were looking i mean they were looking
[19:58] for the fulfillment to come according to
[20:01] their own intellectual understanding by
[20:03] being able to read words
[20:07] they read words and envisioned in their
[20:10] mind the fulfillment of those words amen
[20:13] but when god sent the fulfillment of
[20:15] those same words it didn't match the
[20:18] vision of their intellectual mind
[20:22] it was far away from what they thought
[20:26] in 1961 in the message serves we would
[20:28] see jesus said in john the baptist the
[20:31] elijah that was coming that he would be
[20:33] some great fellow because the mountains
[20:35] would skip like rams and the leaves
[20:36] would clap their hands and the high
[20:38] places made low and the low places high
[20:41] well they expected some great
[20:42] outstanding something to shake the
[20:44] nation
[20:45] but when he come what was he he was a
[20:47] man with a piece of sheepskin draped
[20:48] around and with beard all over his face
[20:51] lives off of locust and wild honey come
[20:53] forth preaching on the money banks of
[20:55] jordan and shaking the churches to
[20:57] repentance
[20:59] they didn't want to come to repentance
[21:01] they just wanted the lord to come and
[21:02] set up his kingdom
[21:06] they just wanted all the the blessings
[21:09] and the good things associated with the
[21:11] fulfillment of prophecy amen they didn't
[21:13] they didn't realize that this calling of
[21:15] repentance was the preparation for the
[21:17] coming of the lord
[21:19] and again in god hiding himself in
[21:21] simplicity he says what did happen an
[21:24] old whiskered guy like that with no
[21:26] education at all with a piece of
[21:28] sheepskin wrapped around him come
[21:30] stumbling out of the wilderness of judea
[21:32] saying repent for the kingdom of heaven
[21:34] is at hand and you bunch of snakes don't
[21:36] you think to say i belong to a certain
[21:38] organization god's able these stones to
[21:40] rise children to abraham
[21:43] see brother branham is now he's coming
[21:46] he's coming after getting caught up into
[21:48] the constellation of seven angels and
[21:50] told to go back for the revelation of
[21:52] the seven seals and so now he's come
[21:54] back and he's come to the first service
[21:57] in a series of services where he's going
[21:59] to be preaching on the seven seals and
[22:01] this first service he comes to is god
[22:03] hiding himself in simplicity then
[22:05] revealing himself in the same and
[22:07] brother ma'am it starts off by doing a
[22:09] dedication service because they just did
[22:11] a a remodel to the tabernacle and
[22:14] expanded it so he explains all of that
[22:16] he says now
[22:17] he goes i don't have time to get into
[22:19] those seals i'm just going to take this
[22:21] little message here but it'll tie right
[22:23] in
[22:25] it'll tie right in
[22:27] he said now watch it it'll tie right in
[22:30] and so brother branham says i'm not
[22:32] preaching yet on the seals i'm just
[22:34] preaching this i'm just preaching this
[22:36] because of the dedication i don't have
[22:38] time but it'll tie right in so you
[22:41] you've got to understand that the
[22:43] prophet his steps were ordered of the
[22:45] lord amen what he preached when he
[22:46] preached the order he preached it and
[22:48] how he preached it it all matters
[22:51] and here he comes at the very beginning
[22:53] of preaching the seals he starts with
[22:56] god hiding himself in simplicity then
[22:58] revealing himself in the same
[23:01] so we see
[23:03] i just i like this title i could just
[23:05] preach on this title because we
[23:06] understand that god hides himself in
[23:09] simplicity absolutely god hides himself
[23:11] in simplicity but he reveals himself in
[23:14] the same so it's not just hidden in
[23:17] simplicity it's revealed in simplicity
[23:20] so you can say god's hidden in
[23:22] simplicity but god doesn't want to stay
[23:25] hidden in the simplicity he wants to be
[23:27] revealed through the simplicity
[23:30] so the whole point is for god to bring
[23:32] the revelation of his word not to keep
[23:35] it hidden
[23:36] he hid it in simplicity so that he could
[23:39] reveal it through simplicity so that
[23:41] only the predestinated seed would catch
[23:43] it revealed through simplicity and
[23:45] everybody else would miss it
[23:48] but it's not just to be hidden in
[23:49] simplicity
[23:51] is to be revealed in the same
[23:55] now he's he's here preaching about
[23:58] john the baptist showing up
[24:00] he's he's hauling repent for the kingdom
[24:02] of heaven is at hand says you bunch of
[24:04] snakes don't you think to say i belong
[24:06] to a certain organization
[24:08] god's able to these stones to rise
[24:10] children and abraham
[24:12] they said my well that's not him there
[24:14] we know that's not him but it was him
[24:18] see he was making the path clean
[24:23] there's when the rough places was made
[24:25] plain
[24:27] there's when the high places was brought
[24:29] down
[24:31] don't you think you got abraham to your
[24:33] father don't begin to tell me that kind
[24:35] of stuff because god's able these stones
[24:36] to rise children to abraham the high
[24:38] places were brought down oh my that's it
[24:41] yes see the difference
[24:43] he said that's what would take place and
[24:45] when they come they thought oh my they
[24:47] was just ready to receive him if he
[24:49] would come to their own organization
[24:51] but because he came like that in such a
[24:53] simple way yet in interpreting the
[24:55] scriptures the high places was made low
[24:58] they didn't want to accept it but they
[25:00] was
[25:02] boy
[25:02] he shaved them off he shook the hide
[25:05] right off of them you bunch of vipers
[25:06] you snakes in the grass i tell you the
[25:09] axes laid to the root of the tree and
[25:10] every tree that won't bring forth fruit
[25:12] is cut down and cast into the lake of
[25:14] fire and i indeed will baptize you with
[25:16] water but there's coming one after me
[25:18] who's mightier than i he will baptize
[25:21] you with the holy ghost and fire and his
[25:23] fan is in his hand and he will
[25:24] thoroughly purge the floors of straw
[25:27] burn up the shaft and take the wheat to
[25:28] the garner
[25:30] that was when the rough places was made
[25:32] plain
[25:33] but the people didn't get it
[25:36] but it's just exactly with the word just
[25:38] exactly the way the word said it so
[25:41] simple that they missed it they missed
[25:44] seeing it
[25:45] don't you be blind see don't you be
[25:48] blind
[25:49] brother tells this story about the
[25:51] coming of elijah and the fulfillment of
[25:53] the prophecy and when he finishes that
[25:55] he's admonishing the people said don't
[25:57] you be blind
[25:59] now they were blind they missed it but
[26:00] don't you be blind what's he preaching
[26:02] god hiding himself in simplicity what's
[26:04] he going into the opening of the seals
[26:06] you don't don't you be blind amen
[26:09] this is the way god does it and so now
[26:12] when when when
[26:13] when uh uh
[26:15] john the baptist was standing there in
[26:17] the spirit of elijah preaching such a
[26:19] strong message ripping the hide off of
[26:21] the system they meant and bringing them
[26:23] down amen don't you think that that you
[26:26] have abraham to your father god's able
[26:27] to these stones to raise up abraham he
[26:29] was bringing the high places low and the
[26:31] low places high he was taking the
[26:33] crooked places and straighten them out
[26:34] because he says you vipers amen
[26:38] and and he was doing exactly what the
[26:41] prophecy said he would do and for us we
[26:44] have no problem saying amen to that
[26:46] because we can read it in the new
[26:47] testament bible we can read jesus say
[26:50] this was elias that was to come but if
[26:52] you had been there that day amen and you
[26:54] read these scriptures and you saw that
[26:56] manifestation there's only one way to
[26:58] take these scriptures and that
[26:59] manifestation and line them up together
[27:02] and the only way is to have direct
[27:04] revelation from your father because god
[27:06] does it in such a way that he does
[27:08] exactly what he said he will do but when
[27:11] he does exactly what he say he'll do it
[27:13] looks so different to an understanding
[27:15] you get through intellectual reading of
[27:17] the bible
[27:20] oprah on the same page
[27:23] so all christians have no problem saying
[27:27] that john the baptist fulfilled these
[27:28] scriptures but that's just because they
[27:31] can read where jesus said and the bible
[27:33] said that john fulfilled these
[27:35] scriptures if the bible hadn't said that
[27:37] and john came and went amen if the bible
[27:40] if you couldn't read in your new
[27:41] testament that john fulfilled those
[27:43] scriptures and jesus didn't say himself
[27:45] that he was alliance you would be
[27:47] sitting here and trying to add up the
[27:49] prophecy in isaiah 40 with the
[27:51] fulfillment john the baptist and he
[27:53] supposed amen to make a highway in the
[27:56] wilderness a highway in the desert for
[27:57] the lord he is supposed to take the
[27:59] mountains and bring them low and make
[28:01] the valleys and build them up and make
[28:03] the crooked places straight and the
[28:04] rough place is smooth amen so that all
[28:07] flesh will see the glory of the lord
[28:09] that's actually what's written
[28:13] and he didn't come with a shovel he'd
[28:16] have a bulldozer he didn't have a
[28:18] working crew he didn't move as far as we
[28:20] know any dirt
[28:24] but what he did is he stood out on the
[28:25] banks of jordan and he says you
[28:28] pharisees you sadducees you highfalutin
[28:30] come down off of your high horse amen
[28:32] and you simple you beggars and you
[28:34] prostitutes hey you're children of god
[28:36] too you come on up come to repentance
[28:38] and come to the same place
[28:41] you come down you come up amen come to
[28:44] the same what was he doing he was making
[28:47] a highway in the wilderness he was
[28:48] preparing the way of the lord by
[28:51] knocking what was he doing he was
[28:53] spiritually fulfilling what was
[28:55] physically spoken by isaiah the prophet
[29:02] and something in the people moved them
[29:04] to his ministry they recognized that god
[29:07] was there they considered him a prophet
[29:09] even if they didn't understand the
[29:10] prophecies that was being fulfilled
[29:12] we know that even his disciples didn't
[29:14] completely understand because we know
[29:16] john was one of his disciples
[29:19] and when when when when the second day
[29:21] after jesus was baptized amen when john
[29:24] the baptist pointed and to jesus said
[29:27] behold the lamb of god to take away the
[29:28] sins of the world john the disciple he
[29:31] left john the baptist and he started
[29:33] following jesus
[29:35] so we know he was one and we know there
[29:37] was two that did that and and i believe
[29:39] it was uh john and andrew
[29:42] and they turned from that ministry and
[29:44] started following the lamb of god
[29:49] but there was a day that the disciples
[29:52] sat down and asked jesus
[29:55] why do the scriptures say that elias
[29:57] must come first
[30:00] john and andrew were sitting there
[30:02] they had been part of that ministry that
[30:04] ministry that ministry pointed them to
[30:08] the lamb of god and they took the word
[30:10] of john the baptist as a forerunner
[30:12] pointing to the lamb of god and followed
[30:13] the lamb of god and still sat down and
[30:15] asked jesus i thought there was supposed
[30:17] to be more scriptures fulfilled
[30:20] and he said it he's already come
[30:24] and you didn't know it
[30:30] see it's going to take revelation
[30:33] from god
[30:35] a select
[30:36] seed upon the earth
[30:38] because he's going to hide it in
[30:40] simplicity
[30:42] they were looking for something huge
[30:46] on a huge scale
[30:49] and what they got
[30:51] was a wild man with a fuzzy face and a
[30:54] camel's hair coat and a leather and
[30:56] girdle eating locust and honey and
[30:58] screaming on the banks of the river and
[31:00] condemning them at every turn
[31:05] can you imagine the
[31:07] the pharisee who studied all his life
[31:09] and knew the words and knew the hebrew
[31:11] and and knew
[31:13] and knew and knew and knew and knew so
[31:15] much he couldn't learn
[31:18] and he knew so much he couldn't see
[31:21] he saw so much it was blind and he knew
[31:23] so much he couldn't learn
[31:26] can you imagine him listening to john
[31:28] calling him you viper
[31:32] i'm telling you god is able these stones
[31:35] to rise children abraham he's like what
[31:36] is he talking about stones the children
[31:38] of abraham i'm a children a child of
[31:40] abraham i can trace my physical leonard
[31:43] all the way i've got the documents i've
[31:45] got the i've got the certificates i've
[31:47] got evidence that i'm i'm a child of
[31:49] abraham and he's saying don't think to
[31:51] yourself you have abraham to your father
[31:52] god's able to these stones how is god
[31:54] going to take a rock and make a child of
[31:56] abraham
[31:58] see the intellectual mind gets so tied
[32:00] up amen with the language of the bible
[32:03] amen in the fulfillment of the
[32:04] scriptures what he was doing when he was
[32:07] knocking that high priest or those
[32:08] priests off of their high horse he was
[32:10] making the high places low
[32:14] and when he was calling sinners to
[32:15] repentance amen he was bringing the low
[32:17] places high
[32:20] he was preparing the way of the lord but
[32:22] it was not
[32:23] according
[32:24] to their understanding
[32:29] and i think we all know
[32:31] that that's repeated in our day
[32:36] the same thing has happened in the day
[32:38] in which we live
[32:40] god has hid it in simplicity but he's
[32:42] revealed it in the same
[32:45] he hid it in that man
[32:47] john
[32:48] who didn't
[32:50] mess with society didn't have any links
[32:52] to society didn't didn't have any
[32:55] support from the church systems he hid
[32:57] it in that man and that man was hiding
[32:59] the mystery
[33:01] he was he was god was hiding himself in
[33:04] the simplicity of that vessel the vessel
[33:07] was simple
[33:09] what was hidden was god
[33:12] it was the word of god coming in the
[33:14] manifestation but the vessel was humble
[33:17] and the vessel was simple and when they
[33:19] looked at the vessel and the mode in
[33:20] which he operated they couldn't expect
[33:23] they couldn't accept that this wonderful
[33:25] great thing was happening in this simple
[33:27] vessel
[33:29] because they were looking for the grand
[33:30] move of god
[33:32] and they were missing the grand move of
[33:34] god
[33:35] they were looking for what man calls big
[33:37] and man calls big god calls foolish
[33:42] let's turn to matthew chapter 11.
[34:00] matthew chapter 11.
[34:03] i want to begin reading in verse seven
[34:07] and as they departed jesus began to say
[34:09] unto the multitudes concerning john
[34:12] what went you out into the wilderness to
[34:14] see
[34:15] a reed shaken with the wind
[34:17] but what went you out for to see a man
[34:19] clothed in soft raiment behold they that
[34:21] wear soft clothing were in king's houses
[34:24] but what went you out for to see a
[34:26] prophet yea i say unto you and more than
[34:28] a prophet for this is he of whom it is
[34:30] written behold i send my messenger
[34:32] before thy face which shall prepare the
[34:34] way before you here jesus is confirming
[34:37] that that man that you went to see is
[34:39] the fulfillment of that prophecy
[34:44] verily i say unto you among them that
[34:46] are born of a woman are not risen a
[34:48] greater than john the baptist
[34:49] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[34:51] kingdom of heaven is greater than he
[34:53] and from the days of john the baptist
[34:55] until now the kingdom of heaven suffers
[34:57] violence and the violent take it by
[34:59] force
[35:00] for all the prophets in the law
[35:01] prophesied until john
[35:03] and if you will receive it this is elias
[35:06] which was for to come
[35:07] he that hath ears to hear
[35:10] let him
[35:10] hear
[35:12] he's telling you if you can receive it
[35:14] this was elias here jesus is standing
[35:17] here himself and jesus himself is
[35:20] telling you that this is the fulfillment
[35:22] of the prophecy in isaiah 40 and malachi
[35:25] 3 this is for the fulfillment of elias
[35:28] and you know jesus didn't have any
[35:31] better reputation than john the baptist
[35:33] had in that day
[35:35] now as christians we look back and say
[35:38] that was him jesus said it was him it's
[35:40] confirmed john said it was him luke said
[35:42] it was him matthew said it was him jesus
[35:44] said it was him amen but jesus was
[35:47] saying that's him but in the day that he
[35:49] was saying it his testimony wasn't any
[35:52] more accepted than john the baptist
[35:53] testimony was accepted
[35:55] that's why he said if you can receive it
[35:57] because he knew he was speaking to a
[35:59] minority of the people who could
[36:01] actually receive what he was saying that
[36:03] this was elias that was for to come and
[36:05] because this was elias and he come that
[36:08] makes me
[36:09] what he foreran amen he said you've got
[36:12] to recognize what's come so you can
[36:15] recognize what's here
[36:19] and so jesus was standing here
[36:20] confirming that there was the
[36:22] forerunner's ministry had come because
[36:25] if that hadn't come he was here to
[36:27] prepare the way of the lord amen the
[36:29] messenger of the covenant and here he
[36:31] was the messenger of the covenant amen
[36:33] the lord himself was standing here in
[36:35] flesh saying if you'll receive it that
[36:37] was elias that was for to come
[36:40] okay that was elias wonderful that was
[36:42] elias
[36:44] okay that was elias
[36:46] what's that saying about jesus
[36:51] see if you could receive it if you can
[36:53] receive that that was elijah if you can
[36:56] receive that
[36:58] then what manifestation are you looking
[36:59] at now
[37:05] if you could receive it that was elias
[37:08] i just i just imagine human beings are
[37:11] human beings or human beings and so
[37:13] sometimes maybe i imagine too much you
[37:15] know what must have been in the and the
[37:16] ears of those that heard that they're
[37:18] like wow that was a lie wow
[37:23] that was elias
[37:26] and they're standing in front of the
[37:27] messenger of the covenant that he was
[37:29] forerunning amen and i wonder how many
[37:32] were still missing that this was the
[37:34] thing that he forerun this was the way
[37:36] that was prepared for him to come he's
[37:38] the one who walked in on that path and
[37:40] now he's standing here the mighty one
[37:42] the great one is standing there saying
[37:45] if you'll receive it that was elias
[37:47] ah
[37:49] i wondered i always wondered i thought
[37:51] maybe but now he said that's elias
[37:58] and jesus is waiting
[38:07] oh man can you believe it that was what
[38:10] isaiah wrote about ah that's what
[38:12] malachi oh that's
[38:14] hey
[38:15] elias has come
[38:20] but the whole point
[38:21] was the manifestation that was standing
[38:23] in front of them
[38:26] and now they caught that elias had come
[38:29] wonderful
[38:31] but who's standing before you
[38:35] see
[38:37] people have always been able to accept
[38:39] the previous dispensation
[38:42] but accepting the current dispensation
[38:44] has always been problematic
[38:49] he says
[38:50] verse 15
[38:52] or verse 14 again if you will if you
[38:54] will receive it
[38:56] this is elias which was for to come
[38:59] he that hath ears to hear
[39:01] let him hear
[39:04] now we've said this before but every one
[39:06] of them had ears that could hear
[39:09] physical words
[39:11] but he's speaking about different ears
[39:15] because they all had ears on their head
[39:17] as far as we know there was nobody
[39:18] without an ear and as far as we know
[39:20] there was none among them that was deaf
[39:22] amen so he was talking about a different
[39:24] set of ears ears that can hear what he's
[39:27] saying
[39:29] not the not the vibrations that's coming
[39:32] off his vocal cords
[39:35] those can hit your natural ears and then
[39:37] you can get a natural understanding of
[39:39] natural words coming from vocal cords
[39:41] but he's looking for those who can hear
[39:43] what he's saying
[39:46] who can hear what he's pointing to
[39:49] and the message god hiding himself in
[39:51] simplicity again says then
[39:53] and watch what he he done
[39:55] he preached such a mighty christ coming
[39:58] he's got his fan in his hand he's
[40:00] fanning his way i mean he will
[40:02] thoroughly purge his floors he will he
[40:05] will take up the trash and sweep it out
[40:08] yonder and burn him that's right
[40:12] you take out the trash sweeping out
[40:13] yonder and burn it that's right he will
[40:14] gather up the grain and take it into the
[40:16] garner see he was inspired but when
[40:18] jesus come they was looking for and all
[40:21] them apostles you know they was looking
[40:23] for a great something to come my my boy
[40:25] he's coming that's all there is to it
[40:27] boy he will be mighty he will kick them
[40:30] romans off the face of the earth my he
[40:32] will make them greeks go this way and
[40:34] romans go that way when he come when he
[40:37] come a little humble fellow being pushed
[40:39] around from one side to the other what
[40:41] was it god hiding himself in simplicity
[40:48] even john the baptist in his ministry
[40:50] those that would accept him now as the
[40:52] forerunner the prophet that would come
[40:54] he's now preaching of jesus he says
[40:56] there's one that coming after me whose
[40:58] shoe lashes i'm not worthy done loose
[41:00] and his fan is in his hand and he'll
[41:02] thoroughly purge his threshing floor and
[41:04] they're like yeah yeah
[41:07] he's going to sweep the romans right out
[41:09] of here he's going to move the greeks
[41:11] he's going to be a mighty conqueror yes
[41:13] yes yes
[41:16] and because they were looking for a
[41:18] mighty warrior with a fan in the hand
[41:19] that would thoroughly purge his
[41:20] threshing floor they missed the little
[41:23] stoop shoulder
[41:26] man
[41:27] prophet who came walking along healing
[41:29] the sick and doing miracles and
[41:32] they missed that this was what john was
[41:35] speaking about because when john spoke
[41:37] about that they envisioned something in
[41:39] their mind by intellect and when he
[41:41] stood there before them amen they didn't
[41:45] correlate this is that
[41:53] when he come he's a little humble fella
[41:56] being pushed around from one side to the
[41:59] other
[42:00] they wanted a general they didn't want
[42:03] this little man
[42:04] who would hide himself and move through
[42:06] the crowd and and leave
[42:10] they didn't want this man who was being
[42:12] rejected and scorned and ridiculed and
[42:15] he would just go from place to place or
[42:17] leave jerusalem because they wanted to
[42:18] stone him and go back into galilee they
[42:21] didn't want that kind they were looking
[42:22] for the mighty one with his fan in his
[42:24] hand that would thoroughly purge his
[42:26] threshing floor
[42:28] they wanted their understanding of what
[42:30] that was
[42:33] he says it's got to come in their own
[42:35] way
[42:36] for their own denomination and except it
[42:38] does that it isn't him it's just
[42:40] psychology or it's the devil or it's not
[42:42] god because if it was god he'd have to
[42:44] come in their own way you see the way
[42:46] we've got it interpreted
[42:48] that's the way that jesus had to come to
[42:50] the pharisees it had to be that way see
[42:53] if god was going to send the messiah
[42:55] they had it all interpreted just how he
[42:57] must be and because he come different
[43:00] than it then he wasn't the messiah
[43:02] he was the illegitimate something he was
[43:04] the beelzebub but it was god hiding in
[43:07] simplicity so you see what the
[43:09] denominations do and then i'd like to
[43:11] say it this way you see what the
[43:13] denominational spirit does
[43:15] because if we say denominations you'll
[43:17] miss it because it comes so much closer
[43:19] to home than that
[43:21] we've been separated from the
[43:22] denominations now since the ministry of
[43:24] brother banham but don't forget there's
[43:26] a denominational spirit that's still
[43:28] moving
[43:29] that's still trying to infiltrate to
[43:31] penetrate to have influence because
[43:33] that's the spirit that he's always the
[43:35] antichrist has always used to derail the
[43:37] plan of god and to trick that trapped
[43:39] the people of god so he's not moving to
[43:41] new tactics he's still using that old
[43:43] denominational spirit
[43:45] and the denominational spirit had an
[43:48] intellectual interpretation of the
[43:49] fulfillment of the scriptures so that
[43:51] when jesus came now because he came
[43:55] different than their understanding they
[43:57] couldn't just leave him alone and let
[43:59] him preach because he came different now
[44:02] he couldn't be the messiah and if he's
[44:04] not the messiah then he must be
[44:05] beelzebub
[44:08] so that's why it's an antichrist spirit
[44:10] because an antichrist spirit is not a
[44:12] spirit that just says i don't understand
[44:14] that it doesn't make sense to me an
[44:16] antichrist spirit says that's not him
[44:19] that's not god that's not christ that's
[44:21] not the fulfillment of the word that's
[44:23] not the truth that's not right that's an
[44:25] antichrist spirit amen
[44:28] and so the antichrist spirit is not
[44:30] somebody who is just confused on the
[44:32] matter and somebody says i don't
[44:34] understand it doesn't make sense to me i
[44:36] don't know the denominational antichrist
[44:38] spirit couldn't just say i don't know
[44:40] he's doing a good work i don't
[44:41] understand maybe it's god maybe it's not
[44:43] i'm not sure yet let's just wait and see
[44:46] no the antichrist spirit said no look in
[44:49] the scriptures
[44:52] does it say anything about a prophet out
[44:55] of nazareth he's not it
[44:59] look at the scriptures where was the
[45:00] forerunner that made the highway in the
[45:02] wilderness that hasn't come yet so this
[45:04] isn't him
[45:05] [Music]
[45:08] when he comes he's going to thoroughly
[45:10] purge the threshing floor he's going to
[45:12] do this and do that and so they take
[45:14] they they take their own interpretation
[45:18] of the words that they have read in the
[45:20] book and they try to match the
[45:22] manifestation to their own
[45:24] interpretation and when the
[45:25] manifestation doesn't match the
[45:27] interpretation they reject the
[45:29] manifestation and call it bl's above
[45:32] they call it an evil spirit they call it
[45:35] heresy they call it a cult they call it
[45:38] all kinds of things and that
[45:40] denominational spirit is an antichrist
[45:42] spirit that will fight the very
[45:44] fulfillment of the word instead of just
[45:46] leaving it alone gamaliel showed a great
[45:48] example he said just leave it alone if
[45:50] it was not of god it will come to not
[45:52] amen but don't go out there and blast
[45:54] what you don't understand
[45:59] and so now
[46:01] now the the because it didn't come
[46:03] according to their denominational
[46:05] understanding
[46:08] now
[46:09] they see a manifestation but the
[46:11] manifestation doesn't master
[46:13] understanding
[46:14] so they attribute the manifestation to
[46:16] the devil
[46:19] instead of recognizing this is the lord
[46:22] this is the messenger of the covenant
[46:23] that was elias that was to come and this
[46:25] is him
[46:31] let's go to malachi chapter 4.
[46:53] malachi chapter 4 verse 5.
[46:57] behold i will send you elijah the
[46:59] prophet before the coming of the great
[47:00] and dreadful day of the lord
[47:02] and he shall turn the heart of the
[47:04] fathers to the children
[47:05] and the heart of the children to their
[47:07] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[47:10] with a curse
[47:12] here's another prophecy laying of a
[47:14] forerunning of elijah
[47:16] and we know that this is a split
[47:18] prophecy in verse 6 because we know that
[47:20] john the baptist
[47:22] four ran his first coming and john the
[47:24] baptist did the first part of this all
[47:26] the way to the comma he turned the heart
[47:29] of the fathers to the children because
[47:31] they were coming to a new and living way
[47:33] the fulfillment of the law and christ
[47:35] was going to become the propitiation for
[47:37] their sins and they were being brought
[47:38] into a new and living way to enter into
[47:40] the holy of holies
[47:42] and so now he fulfilled that the turning
[47:44] the hearts of the fathers to the
[47:46] children but there's another part of the
[47:48] prophecy
[47:49] and the heart of the children to their
[47:51] fathers so now the children that now are
[47:54] going to grow up this new testament
[47:56] children there's going to come a time
[47:58] that the heart of these same children
[48:00] are going to be turned back to the
[48:01] original fathers to the original
[48:03] pentecostal fathers
[48:05] and so when you read this prophecy he
[48:07] says now
[48:12] verse 5 behold i will send you a lie to
[48:14] the prophet before the coming of the
[48:15] great and dreadful day of the lord so
[48:17] christians know that this is a prophecy
[48:19] that must be fulfilled
[48:22] and he shall turn the heart of the
[48:23] fathers to the children in the heart of
[48:24] the children to their fathers lest i
[48:26] come and smite the earth with a curse
[48:28] we read this scripture and for us by
[48:31] revelation it is so easy to understand
[48:34] we can see the fulfillment of this but
[48:36] just imagine reading the scripture amen
[48:39] for for uh 2 000 years before the coming
[48:42] of the prophet in this end time to
[48:43] fulfill this amen you have to come up
[48:45] with all kinds of ideas of what it means
[48:48] to turn the hearts of the fathers and
[48:49] the fathers and the children and man
[48:51] there's there's whole ministries and
[48:53] christian them out there
[48:54] there's whole ministries that are called
[48:56] the elijah ministries that are trying to
[48:58] restore natural fathers and natural sons
[49:02] they're having camps and crusades and
[49:04] teaching fathers how to be good dads and
[49:06] bring the relationship between a natural
[49:08] father and natural son and they believe
[49:10] that they're fulfilling this prophecy
[49:13] see what the carnal mind does
[49:16] and when you see the prophecy fulfilled
[49:19] what is the fulfillment of the prophecy
[49:20] it comes in such a simple vessel amen it
[49:23] comes
[49:24] in a man amen born in poverty in
[49:26] kentucky amen a small man of stature
[49:29] without much education and a seventh
[49:31] grade education with no political
[49:34] backing with no with no uh uh
[49:36] institutional backing with no formal
[49:38] education god took such a simple vessel
[49:41] to fulfill this prophecy
[49:45] and we
[49:46] we you know we we who have have eyes to
[49:50] see and ears to hear we look at the
[49:52] fulfillment and say absolutely that's
[49:54] the fulfillment but listen we see it so
[49:56] plain because we have eyes to see and
[49:58] ears to hear
[49:59] it's been revealed to us of the father
[50:01] so for us it's not a stumbling block we
[50:03] can look at that and say that's
[50:04] absolutely the truth and we've seen the
[50:07] manifestation of that but the
[50:08] manifestation came so simple it came so
[50:11] humble that millions and billions have
[50:14] had a hard time accepting that this is
[50:16] the fulfillment of that scripture
[50:19] he come in such a simple vessel but
[50:22] realize that that scripture was hidden
[50:24] in simplicity amen
[50:27] of a man that that when he started in
[50:30] the ministry couldn't read his own
[50:31] scriptures he would have his girlfriend
[50:33] stand up in church and read the
[50:34] scriptures
[50:37] now listen if you're if you're one of
[50:39] the big highfalutin denomination
[50:41] scholars i mean that's a hard pill to
[50:44] swallow that god is going to forerun the
[50:46] second coming amen he's going to send
[50:48] elijah before the great and dreadful day
[50:50] of the lord to turn the hearts of the
[50:51] children back to the fathers and this
[50:53] man this man that he's going to use he
[50:56] can't read his own bible in front of
[50:57] people he'll hand it to his his
[50:59] girlfriend
[51:02] and ask his girlfriend to read the
[51:04] scriptures and then he'll preach oh
[51:06] that's a that's a hard one to accept
[51:08] friends
[51:10] unless
[51:11] unless you have eyes to see
[51:14] and ears to hear and you can say that's
[51:16] perfect that's the way he's always
[51:17] worked
[51:19] that's the way the bible's written
[51:21] that's the pattern god has always used
[51:23] but you can see how millions would miss
[51:25] the manifestation of the hour because
[51:27] they missed the way it came
[51:30] it's not that god wasn't faithful to
[51:31] send it it wasn't that god didn't do
[51:33] exactly what he said he would do he he
[51:35] sent it the way he said he would send it
[51:37] he said it when he said he would send it
[51:38] he did exactly what he said he would do
[51:41] but there was such an intellectual
[51:42] understanding of the scripture amen that
[51:44] when it came it couldn't be him so they
[51:47] would have to say he does those things
[51:49] by the devil
[51:52] it's mental telepathy it's familiar
[51:55] spirits it's all of these things why
[51:57] because the denominational spirit amen
[52:00] can't accept it because of intellectual
[52:02] understanding and when they can't accept
[52:04] it when the fulfillment doesn't match
[52:06] their interpretation then they reject
[52:08] the fulfillment
[52:13] praise god
[52:15] in the message of the
[52:16] trial we're not preaching anything new
[52:19] so don't wait for the new thing
[52:22] we've heard all of this before but it it
[52:24] just becomes more real to us all the
[52:26] time amen it becomes more tangible it
[52:29] becomes more vivid amen week by week
[52:31] month by month
[52:34] and the trial says he spoke
[52:36] down on the river he said as john the
[52:38] baptist was sent forth to proclaim the
[52:40] coming of christ
[52:42] oh
[52:48] oh praise god
[52:51] i'm going to read the rest of this
[52:52] sentence
[52:55] this is
[52:56] this is the that pillar of fire that
[52:58] came down in 1933 when brother branham
[53:00] was baptizing the 17th person and that
[53:03] pillar of fire spoke listen to how
[53:05] brother ben repeats it this time listen
[53:07] to what he says he says he spoke down on
[53:09] the river he said as john the baptist
[53:11] was sent forth to proclaim the coming of
[53:13] christ at the end of his ministry jesus
[53:16] came
[53:21] as john was sent so will your ministry
[53:24] forerun the second coming of christ
[53:26] what did he just say amen let's not
[53:29] gloss over these things what did he just
[53:30] say he said as he's making a type he's
[53:33] running a parallel picture as john the
[53:36] baptist was sent forth to proclaim the
[53:37] coming of christ at the end of his
[53:39] ministry jesus came
[53:43] and as john was sent so will your
[53:45] ministry before run the second coming of
[53:47] christ so if they're a parallel if
[53:49] they're running on parallel tracks amen
[53:52] then as john the baptist 4 ran the first
[53:55] coming of christ so will your ministry
[53:57] before run the second coming but how did
[53:59] it work the first time amen at the end
[54:01] of his ministry jesus came
[54:03] so what will you expect the second time
[54:05] at the end of his ministry jesus will
[54:07] come
[54:08] brother branham's drawing a parallel
[54:10] he's typing the two as amen but the
[54:13] coming of the lord is such a mystery to
[54:15] the minds of people because they've take
[54:17] catholic dogma and they've reheated
[54:19] through the lutherans through the
[54:20] methodist through the pentecostals until
[54:22] they've got a vision and an image of the
[54:24] coming of the lord that is not
[54:26] scriptural
[54:31] and because of that because of that
[54:34] intellectual understanding of reading
[54:36] the bible and coming up with their own
[54:38] interpretation now when he comes and
[54:40] fulfills the promise in our day the
[54:43] interpretation doesn't match the
[54:45] fulfillment so what do they do to the
[54:47] fulfillment amen they call it horrible
[54:49] names they say it's a false teaching and
[54:52] it's heresy and it's antichrist and it's
[54:54] a colton
[55:02] but as
[55:04] john the baptist
[55:06] four ran his first coming so your
[55:08] ministry before in a second
[55:11] ask john at the end of his ministry
[55:13] jesus came
[55:16] well what happens at the end of brother
[55:18] benham's ministry
[55:20] maybe the same thing
[55:23] maybe it's the same way
[55:25] maybe what that maybe what god was
[55:27] speaking on that pillar of fire was the
[55:28] truth
[55:30] maybe we missed it because we had our
[55:33] own doctrine our own denominational
[55:36] understanding we already had a picture
[55:38] in my mind and listen i don't fault
[55:40] anybody for having a picture in my mind
[55:42] i've had it all my life
[55:45] all my life i was taught a certain way i
[55:47] read the bible with a certain
[55:48] intellectual understanding i have my own
[55:50] pictures and you know what i'm finding
[55:52] out sometimes i still have my own
[55:54] pictures that god is correcting from the
[55:55] message and from the bible
[55:57] the god is still breaking down some of
[55:59] the wrong images that i have the wrong
[56:02] pictures i have in my mind because i'm
[56:04] taking it by intellectual reading amen
[56:06] and if we've learned anything this
[56:08] morning i hope we learn that you cannot
[56:12] see the fulfillment by an intellectual
[56:14] reading of the promise because there was
[56:16] no way that you could read the
[56:19] intellectual promise of a forerunner and
[56:21] look at john the baptist and say he
[56:24] fulfilled that
[56:26] how would you ever come up with that
[56:28] intellectually
[56:30] it doesn't match intellectually but by
[56:34] revelation spiritually it just goes like
[56:36] this
[56:39] so if we've learned anything this
[56:40] morning that's what i want us to learn
[56:42] is you can't just take bible school
[56:46] intellectual reading of a bible and then
[56:49] as the promise that will come and then
[56:51] come to the promise and say i understand
[56:54] it by the intellectual reading you only
[56:56] understand it by seeing the fulfillment
[56:58] and when you see the fulfillment that's
[57:00] the interpretation of the word and then
[57:02] god will quicken to your heart that's it
[57:05] that's the only way you'll see it
[57:06] friends amen you remember they never saw
[57:09] it till it was fulfilled
[57:14] who knew
[57:16] what it was going to look like
[57:18] who knew how he was going to fulfill it
[57:20] i mean who knew what what it was going
[57:23] to be until he does it amen and when he
[57:26] does it when he does it he interprets
[57:28] the word by bringing it to pass
[57:31] and when he interprets the word by
[57:33] bringing it to past
[57:34] then the father must quicken a
[57:36] revelation to you that this is that
[57:49] back to god hiding himself in simplicity
[57:53] he said you love him my isn't he
[57:55] wonderful
[57:56] i hope and trust that the message will
[57:58] produce what it was intended to do
[58:00] what's he talking about this message god
[58:02] hiding himself in simplicity and
[58:03] revealing himself this in the same
[58:06] he's now coming to the end of this
[58:07] message he said i hope and trust that
[58:10] the message will produce what it was
[58:12] intended to do that it'll get you to a
[58:14] place that you don't look for flowery
[58:16] things
[58:18] or some when you see god in greatness
[58:20] look how humble it is and then you'll
[58:22] see god don't look for him when elisha
[58:25] was back in the cave the smoke went
[58:26] across blood thunder lightning and all
[58:29] these kinds of sensations we've had
[58:31] blood in the face and in the hands and
[58:32] sensations and everything they never
[58:34] bothered that prophet he just laid there
[58:36] but he heard a still small voice what
[58:38] was it the word
[58:41] lock that in what was it elijah heard
[58:44] that moved him out of the cave that got
[58:46] him into action he heard the word what
[58:48] was the still small voice the word amen
[58:51] there was a whirlwind amen there was a
[58:53] fire there was a thunder none of it
[58:55] moved him amen but when he heard the
[58:57] still small voice that was the word and
[58:59] when he heard the word he moved
[59:03] but how did he move when he heard the
[59:05] word he took his mantle and wrapped his
[59:07] face in humility amen and he come out to
[59:11] face god because he was called by the
[59:13] word out of the cave
[59:16] and god was god gonna call you and i by
[59:18] the whirlwind by the fire by the by the
[59:21] by the earthquake or he's gonna call you
[59:23] by the still small voice of his word and
[59:26] how we'll know he called you is because
[59:28] you will wrap a mantle around your face
[59:30] and walk out of that cave with humility
[59:32] not pride not arrogant but humility
[59:35] because you'll recognize this small
[59:37] voice this still small voice that is the
[59:40] word that is god
[59:47] he heard a still small voice what was it
[59:49] the word then he covered his face and
[59:51] walked out see that was it
[59:53] remember friend don't look for great big
[59:55] you say god he speaks of great big
[59:57] things there'll come a time they'll be
[59:59] this that or the other great big things
[1:00:01] i hope you're catching what i'm talking
[1:00:03] about see
[1:00:04] great big things and all when this comes
[1:00:06] to pass it'll be great big like this and
[1:00:09] it'll be so humble you'll miss the whole
[1:00:11] thing and just go right on
[1:00:14] you'll look back and say well that never
[1:00:17] did come see passed right over the top
[1:00:19] and you've never even seen it see it's
[1:00:21] so it's so simple god lives in
[1:00:23] simplicity to manifest himself in
[1:00:25] greatness what makes him great because
[1:00:27] he can simplify himself
[1:00:32] mother branham now is coming to the end
[1:00:34] of god hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:00:36] he's saying i hope this message
[1:00:38] has
[1:00:39] the it says i hope it has the effect
[1:00:42] it'll produce what was in it it was
[1:00:44] intended to do
[1:00:46] so brother bram said i'm not preaching
[1:00:48] on the seals yet here but it'll tie
[1:00:50] right into it just catch he said just
[1:00:52] catch what i'm saying and at the end he
[1:00:54] says i hope this message will produce
[1:00:56] what it was intended to produce that you
[1:00:58] don't look for big flowery things that
[1:01:00] you're not looking for great big things
[1:01:01] that if we're looking for the
[1:01:03] fulfillment of the promise what promise
[1:01:05] the promise that was foreran
[1:01:08] because we're looking at brother
[1:01:09] branham's ministry and how many believe
[1:01:11] he's the forerunner
[1:01:14] he's the fulfillment of malachi 4. he's
[1:01:16] the elijah that is to come and man he's
[1:01:19] come he's in his ministry he's for
[1:01:21] running something amen and the thing
[1:01:23] that he's forerunning needs to come
[1:01:28] because like it was for john amen
[1:01:31] jesus came while john was still on earth
[1:01:34] and he's running a parallel
[1:01:36] that's why brother branham when he gets
[1:01:38] to the revelations 10 he starts talking
[1:01:40] about this mighty angel with a rainbow
[1:01:42] overhead with an open book amen he says
[1:01:44] it's none other but the angel the
[1:01:46] covenant it's none other but christ
[1:01:48] and when he looks at that he says now
[1:01:50] this coming
[1:01:52] this seventh angel
[1:01:54] which is the same as malachi 4 elijah
[1:01:57] this seventh angel will be on earth at
[1:01:59] the time of this coming
[1:02:02] which parallels john the baptist the
[1:02:04] first coming
[1:02:06] and so now brother benham is coming to
[1:02:09] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:02:11] here he is the forerunner amen
[1:02:14] forerunning the second coming his
[1:02:16] ministry is forerunning the second
[1:02:17] coming and he's coming to preach the
[1:02:19] seals and he's saying now listen don't
[1:02:22] look for something big what's he coming
[1:02:24] to do preach the seals amen what's he
[1:02:26] coming to do preach amen what was in
[1:02:29] those seven unknown thunders
[1:02:32] the unwritten word that was in the
[1:02:34] pyramid the rock under the rock
[1:02:38] and he's coming to that and he's saying
[1:02:40] now don't look for something big
[1:02:43] when god comes it'll be so humble
[1:02:46] that they'll miss it and go right over
[1:02:48] it
[1:02:50] that was his intended purpose
[1:02:52] of preaching god hiding himself in
[1:02:53] simplicity
[1:02:55] brother branham says he doesn't yet he
[1:02:57] doesn't yet know what those seals are
[1:03:00] and he told us day by day one of those
[1:03:02] angels would come to him and give him
[1:03:03] the revelation amen he would see it he
[1:03:06] would see what it was doing and he would
[1:03:08] write it down then after he wrote it
[1:03:10] down he would search the scriptures to
[1:03:11] find it all through the scriptures then
[1:03:12] he would come preach it that night then
[1:03:14] would happen the next day and the next
[1:03:15] day and the next day so brother branham
[1:03:17] here preaching god hiding himself in
[1:03:18] simplicity does not know what he's going
[1:03:21] to be preaching monday and tuesday and
[1:03:23] wednesday and thursday and friday and
[1:03:26] saturday and sunday he doesn't know what
[1:03:28] he's preaching but he knows the
[1:03:30] principle of god don't look for
[1:03:32] something big amen if you're going to
[1:03:34] see the fulfillment of the scripture if
[1:03:36] this ministry is for running something
[1:03:38] the something that is forerunned is
[1:03:39] going to have to come while this seventh
[1:03:41] angel is on the earth
[1:03:46] and he says don't look for something big
[1:03:49] don't look for something great
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:53] look
[1:03:54] at elijah
[1:03:56] in the cave
[1:03:59] the earth shook
[1:04:01] under the whirlwind the rocks crashed
[1:04:04] the earthquake shook everything around
[1:04:06] him
[1:04:07] the fire burned everything off the
[1:04:09] mountain
[1:04:11] but none of that moved him
[1:04:14] that wasn't it yet
[1:04:17] but when he heard the still small voice
[1:04:19] that was the word
[1:04:22] and it was the smallest thing
[1:04:25] the quietest of the four events
[1:04:30] you had
[1:04:32] the wind
[1:04:33] the whirlwind the fire the earthquake
[1:04:36] and the voice
[1:04:38] the quietest of the four events
[1:04:41] moved the prophet
[1:04:44] the the most subtle of the four events
[1:04:48] moved the prophet
[1:04:50] the the least
[1:04:52] intense i'm speaking just carnally now
[1:04:55] not spiritually
[1:04:57] the least intense
[1:04:59] the least fearful
[1:05:01] the least physically discerned
[1:05:06] that's what moved that prophet
[1:05:09] and what was it it was the word
[1:05:12] because the fourth
[1:05:13] the fourth act the fourth dispensation
[1:05:16] was greater than the three amen
[1:05:19] greater than the fire greater than the
[1:05:21] earthquake greater than than the
[1:05:24] whirlwind greater than all of that was
[1:05:26] the word
[1:05:27] because the word is greatest of all
[1:05:33] see
[1:05:34] brother benham comes now and he preaches
[1:05:36] the seals
[1:05:37] and we know how he preaches through that
[1:05:39] week and he says it's been a
[1:05:40] supernatural week
[1:05:42] he said you know he said i'm nearly he
[1:05:44] comes to the end of it he said i'm
[1:05:45] nearly out of my mind a man a man can
[1:05:47] only take so much he said all of this
[1:05:49] has been happening coming to me day by
[1:05:51] day and and it gets to the end and he
[1:05:53] comes to the seventh seal and he's
[1:05:55] preaching in the seventh seal and he
[1:05:57] comes
[1:05:58] down
[1:05:59] towards the end of the seventh seal and
[1:06:01] he says i better stop right there
[1:06:04] i just feel checked not to say no more
[1:06:06] about it so just remember the seventh
[1:06:08] seal the reason it was not open the
[1:06:10] reason it did not reveal it no one
[1:06:12] should know about it
[1:06:14] and i want you to know before i even
[1:06:15] knowed one word about that the vision
[1:06:17] came years ago you remember that he said
[1:06:20] i feel checked to say no more about it
[1:06:21] and he talks about
[1:06:24] no one should know about it and i want
[1:06:25] you to know before i even know one word
[1:06:27] about that the vision came years ago and
[1:06:29] he's talking about something he
[1:06:30] mentioned previously he said the vision
[1:06:31] came years ago what vision he's talking
[1:06:33] about the third pool vision that he had
[1:06:35] back in 1956
[1:06:38] and the third pool vision he had in 1956
[1:06:40] is where he was fishing amen and
[1:06:43] all the ministers were gathering around
[1:06:44] he was trying to catch the rainbow trout
[1:06:47] in the deep water
[1:06:49] so the rainbow trout were covenant fish
[1:06:51] the rainbow covenant fish in the deep
[1:06:53] water and he had this fishing lure and
[1:06:56] he kind of knew the techniques of
[1:06:57] fishing and the ministers were gathering
[1:06:59] around and wanting to learn how to do it
[1:07:00] and he gave it a little pull and he said
[1:07:02] that attracted the little fish amen and
[1:07:04] then he gave it another jerk which was
[1:07:05] supposed to scatter the fish and attract
[1:07:06] the big fish but he pulled too hard on
[1:07:09] the second pool and when he did he said
[1:07:11] it come out a little fish just like skin
[1:07:13] over the lure he said i caught a little
[1:07:15] one like them other brothers were
[1:07:16] catching
[1:07:20] so that second pool
[1:07:22] caught the same kind of fish all the
[1:07:24] other ministers were catching
[1:07:27] and what was the second pool it was
[1:07:28] discernment
[1:07:30] when he would tell you your name and
[1:07:32] what was wrong with you and and where
[1:07:34] you lived and what had happened in your
[1:07:36] past all of that he he said uh that when
[1:07:40] i pulled that too hard i come out and
[1:07:42] caught a little bee fish just like those
[1:07:44] other brothers were catching
[1:07:50] but he was trying to catch the rainbow
[1:07:52] trout
[1:07:54] so when he pulled too hard he got the
[1:07:56] line tangled around him amen and he was
[1:07:58] upset and the angel told him go don't
[1:08:00] get your line tangled in a time like
[1:08:02] this then he saw that he had a baby shoe
[1:08:04] and he was trying to take a giant cord
[1:08:06] and push it through the eyelid of a baby
[1:08:07] shoe and the voice said you can't teach
[1:08:10] pentecostal babies supernatural things
[1:08:12] leave them alone
[1:08:16] so whatever this is coming after the
[1:08:19] second pool the pentecostal babes can't
[1:08:22] catch it it's got to go beyond
[1:08:25] pentecostal
[1:08:28] now brother man's not talking about
[1:08:29] original pentecostal faith he's talking
[1:08:30] about the pentecostal denomination the
[1:08:32] pentecostal movement what i call
[1:08:34] pentecostalism
[1:08:36] couldn't catch it
[1:08:38] couldn't get it they couldn't catch the
[1:08:40] supernatural things leave them alone
[1:08:43] so then the next thing he's caught up in
[1:08:46] a vision and he sees a giant cathedral
[1:08:48] amen and he's up in the air and there's
[1:08:49] a cathedral there's people outside
[1:08:51] moving their way through to the prayer
[1:08:52] line and there's a little room and he's
[1:08:54] told i'll meet you in there he said this
[1:08:56] will be your third pool
[1:08:59] so the first pool
[1:09:01] you know attracted the fish the second
[1:09:03] pool caught the little fish like
[1:09:05] everybody else was catching but he was
[1:09:06] trying to catch the rainbow trout
[1:09:09] but he said coming to the third pool
[1:09:11] that third pool amen that that's the
[1:09:14] pool that was supposed to catch the
[1:09:16] rainbow trout the covenant fish the elec
[1:09:18] seed have gone
[1:09:20] what was it
[1:09:22] the third pool is the word
[1:09:25] because he goes up to sabino canyon in
[1:09:27] january of 1963 and in sabino canyon
[1:09:29] he's up there praying lord what is this
[1:09:31] all about his hands are in the air and
[1:09:33] something struck his hand and he looked
[1:09:34] it was a sword and a voice said it's the
[1:09:37] sword of the king
[1:09:39] and brother said
[1:09:40] eventually come to the conclusion that
[1:09:42] that a king the king the king not aching
[1:09:45] the king he only has one sword and that
[1:09:47] sword is his word and brother bam said
[1:09:49] so help me it's the word amen it's the
[1:09:52] word that's the third bull watch the
[1:09:55] third bull it's the same thing that
[1:09:57] pulled elijah out of the cave it's the
[1:09:59] word
[1:10:00] and it wasn't the great big fiery things
[1:10:02] it wasn't the great big showy things
[1:10:04] amen the first pull was to attract the
[1:10:06] little fish the second pool was intended
[1:10:08] to it was intended to scatter the fish
[1:10:11] to get the attention of the big fish and
[1:10:12] the third pool was the one that was
[1:10:14] supposed to hook the covenant faith and
[1:10:16] what is the third pull the third pull is
[1:10:18] the word
[1:10:25] and so
[1:10:28] what is the word
[1:10:31] the third pull is the word
[1:10:34] what is the word well it's more
[1:10:36] doctrinal teaching a better
[1:10:39] the word is christ
[1:10:41] the word is a person it's jesus christ
[1:10:45] in the beginning the word was with god
[1:10:47] the word was god we know the word was
[1:10:49] eventually made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:10:51] the word it's the person of the word
[1:10:53] jesus christ himself amen what is the
[1:10:55] third pool it's the word
[1:10:58] i mean we say that it's the word it's
[1:11:00] the word and i think sometimes referring
[1:11:03] back to intellectualism not not anything
[1:11:05] that that we mean to do but going to
[1:11:07] intellectualism we say the word like
[1:11:10] like we'll we'll hold up a bible or
[1:11:11] something and look at a page with black
[1:11:13] marks on it and there's nothing wrong
[1:11:15] with that because this is the
[1:11:16] materialized form of that word but the
[1:11:18] word is a person amen the word is the
[1:11:21] person of the word the anointed word
[1:11:23] jesus christ himself
[1:11:30] what was brother branham doing
[1:11:32] that week amen that he was preaching the
[1:11:35] seals amen he was preaching the mystery
[1:11:39] that laid under those seven thunders and
[1:11:41] then when seven thunders uttered john
[1:11:42] was about to write but he was told don't
[1:11:44] write those things so there was
[1:11:46] something that thunder and he said
[1:11:47] thundered as a voice of god something
[1:11:49] thundered that was not permitted to be
[1:11:51] written and brother banner said when the
[1:11:53] seventh seal opened nothing was written
[1:11:55] john didn't write any he said see
[1:11:56] they're connected together
[1:11:59] these two things are connected together
[1:12:01] what the seventh seal and the sealing up
[1:12:05] of the thunder so what the thunder spoke
[1:12:07] and the that became silent and not
[1:12:09] writing it and the silence under the
[1:12:11] seventh seal those two things are
[1:12:13] connected together
[1:12:20] so what was under those seven thunders
[1:12:23] the unwritten word
[1:12:25] light had never shined upon this before
[1:12:28] now the prophet of god is coming day by
[1:12:31] day not of his own accord not of his own
[1:12:33] ability but one of those messenger
[1:12:35] angels came every day and gave him the
[1:12:37] revelation and he saw it and he saw what
[1:12:39] it did and he wrote it out and then he
[1:12:41] went through the scriptures to search it
[1:12:43] out amen and then he would bring it that
[1:12:45] night then he would do it the next day
[1:12:46] then he would do it the next day what
[1:12:47] was he doing amen he was preaching the
[1:12:50] revelation of the seven seals amen that
[1:12:53] means the seven seals were breaking open
[1:12:55] and the sounding of the thunders they
[1:12:57] were opened 2000 years ago in symbol
[1:12:59] form but the interpretation of the
[1:13:01] symbols was the breaking forth of the
[1:13:03] sealed thunders
[1:13:06] and the only one that can break those
[1:13:08] seals is the lamb
[1:13:11] that's why brother branham when he's in
[1:13:13] the seals he says
[1:13:15] he he says oh i don't know which which
[1:13:17] sermon it's in either god hiding himself
[1:13:19] in simplicity or the breathe he says now
[1:13:21] if you'll watch you'll see something
[1:13:23] happening this week remember those
[1:13:24] angels he said i hope i don't have to
[1:13:26] take it right out in my hand and show it
[1:13:28] to you
[1:13:30] remember he said that i hope i don't
[1:13:32] have to take it right out then later he
[1:13:34] says i hope you've seen the mysterious
[1:13:36] part of the week what is it it's those
[1:13:37] seven angels
[1:13:40] well of course the seven angels are a
[1:13:42] mystery i mean they made up the head of
[1:13:43] christ they're angels we can't see them
[1:13:45] of course they're a mystery what were
[1:13:47] the angels doing they were coming to him
[1:13:49] day by day to give him the revelation of
[1:13:51] the broken seal showing that the lamb is
[1:13:54] the only one that can break the seal
[1:13:57] so who's the one breaking the seals
[1:14:00] who was it in march of 1963 that was
[1:14:04] breaking the seals and revealing to the
[1:14:05] prophet it was the lamb he's the only
[1:14:08] one who could do it brother brahm said
[1:14:10] it's not me don't put any man in this at
[1:14:12] all don't look to me don't even say
[1:14:14] thank you
[1:14:17] it wasn't me at all that wasn't my
[1:14:19] thinking it was them angels
[1:14:24] what was it
[1:14:26] the lamb was on the scene
[1:14:29] and
[1:14:30] he come in such simplicity
[1:14:34] it was a simple vessel
[1:14:36] with a seventh grade education
[1:14:38] with no seminary training
[1:14:40] with no big backing
[1:14:43] and he was preaching in a little brick
[1:14:44] building in jeffersonville indiana on
[1:14:47] the corner of 8th and penn street
[1:14:50] have anybody been by the building
[1:14:52] don't look for great big things
[1:14:55] don't look for flowery things
[1:14:58] in that building
[1:15:00] day after day
[1:15:01] day after day
[1:15:03] the lamb was breaking the seals
[1:15:06] brother i'm saying can you see what's
[1:15:08] going on do you see what's going on it's
[1:15:10] all around you and you've missed it
[1:15:12] around me
[1:15:16] see intellectualism will never catch it
[1:15:19] it's all around me what's around me
[1:15:21] something's here how do i it was
[1:15:24] happening all around them
[1:15:26] what the preaching of the seals
[1:15:29] it was happening all around them that
[1:15:31] week and they were missing the
[1:15:32] significance of what was taking place
[1:15:35] they were reveling in the revelation
[1:15:37] underneath those symbols that wow that
[1:15:40] ties together and that ties together and
[1:15:42] that ties together in that time wow it
[1:15:45] all ties together
[1:15:49] yes it all ties together
[1:15:53] that's what the seal means that's what
[1:15:55] the thunders uttered oh i see it now
[1:15:59] do you see it now
[1:16:02] do you see
[1:16:03] do you see it now
[1:16:06] well now yeah i see i see a white horse
[1:16:08] and his antichrist coming forth and i
[1:16:10] and i see a red horse now he's fighting
[1:16:12] in blackwood i see it i see what was in
[1:16:15] those seven thunders do you really see
[1:16:17] it
[1:16:19] because who's the one breaking the seals
[1:16:21] that's the mysterious part of the week
[1:16:26] that's what was coming in such
[1:16:27] simplicity they were missing the mighty
[1:16:30] angel had come down with an open book in
[1:16:32] his hand and the seventh angel was on
[1:16:33] earth at the time of this coming and now
[1:16:35] he was proving it by the preaching of
[1:16:38] the seals
[1:16:40] and the preaching of the seals was
[1:16:42] proving that the mighty angel has come
[1:16:45] down with an open book in his hand
[1:16:49] and brother bam said it's been going on
[1:16:50] all around you all this week have you
[1:16:52] caught the mysterious part of them week
[1:16:53] charlie remember that vision remember
[1:16:55] it's them been them angels
[1:16:58] what
[1:16:59] the angels of the mystery what the
[1:17:01] constellation want turn it to the right
[1:17:04] who is it
[1:17:07] see the mysterious part of the week
[1:17:10] was the one who was able to break the
[1:17:11] seals
[1:17:14] how many people left
[1:17:16] saying i never knew a white horse rider
[1:17:18] was an antichrist i always thought that
[1:17:21] was christ
[1:17:23] and they weren't wrong
[1:17:26] and it wasn't wrong for them to marvel
[1:17:27] in that revelation that was right
[1:17:31] and how many people were saying but did
[1:17:32] you ever notice the red horse when they
[1:17:34] went out and you notice it matches the
[1:17:36] church ages just perfectly
[1:17:39] but brother branham said there's a
[1:17:40] mystery that lays under those
[1:17:43] what is the mystery that lays out the
[1:17:45] thunders the mystery that lays over the
[1:17:47] thunders is the one who broke the seals
[1:17:51] that's the mystery laying under those
[1:17:53] seven thunders
[1:17:56] he goes now he's in the seventh seal
[1:17:58] he's preached all of this and it's just
[1:18:00] amazing to me he's preached all of this
[1:18:03] and now he comes to the seventh seal and
[1:18:05] the seventh seal he's actually not
[1:18:08] saying anything like he did the first
[1:18:11] he's saying a lot
[1:18:13] go back and read the seventh seal again
[1:18:15] brother branham is telling you what the
[1:18:17] seal is
[1:18:18] in the seventh seal
[1:18:20] he's absolutely the first time i read
[1:18:22] the seventh seal i read it with
[1:18:24] anticipation i read it with baited
[1:18:25] breath i'd gone through six seals and i
[1:18:27] understood what he was talking about i
[1:18:29] saw it tied together i saw it run down
[1:18:31] through the scripture and then i knew i
[1:18:33] knew he had went down through i think it
[1:18:35] was matthew 24 and showed that when
[1:18:37] jesus went through the six seals he left
[1:18:38] off the seven in revelation chapter
[1:18:40] eight he left off the seventh amen in
[1:18:42] revelation chapter 10 the seven thunders
[1:18:44] were sealed up and i'm like oh here it
[1:18:47] comes
[1:18:50] and i'm reading and i'm reading and i'm
[1:18:52] reading and i remember reading like i
[1:18:55] had so caught what brother bannon was
[1:18:57] showing and how the seals were open and
[1:18:59] how he showed the interpretation of
[1:19:01] those seven seals and how he tied it all
[1:19:03] the way down to the scripture and how he
[1:19:05] showed that nothing yet has been written
[1:19:07] about the seventh and i i so saw that
[1:19:09] that i get to the seventh i'm like it's
[1:19:11] coming it's coming amen the thing that
[1:19:14] wasn't written he's gonna tell us all
[1:19:15] about it and i remember my heart beating
[1:19:17] faster as i got further back in the book
[1:19:21] and he said now i feel to stop right
[1:19:23] there
[1:19:27] it was the letdown of my life
[1:19:32] i remember being so disappointed
[1:19:34] and so discouraged
[1:19:36] and then after that he just goes back
[1:19:38] and tells all the stories again
[1:19:41] do you remember
[1:19:42] what i told you in the vision what time
[1:19:44] is it sirs yeah i heard that
[1:19:46] i want to know what the seventh seal is
[1:19:50] do you remember that constellation of
[1:19:51] the angels and i went out west and come
[1:19:53] back for the interpretation you remember
[1:19:54] that do you remember the the vision i
[1:19:57] had and i had the baby shoe in my hand
[1:19:59] remember and he said i'll meet you in
[1:20:00] there and and he said you remember that
[1:20:02] will be your third pool then on sabine
[1:20:04] canyon that day and that happened he
[1:20:05] said this is your third pool so brother
[1:20:07] man i'm saying he said that was that
[1:20:09] will be your third floor foreshadowing
[1:20:10] it seven years before now seven years
[1:20:12] later he's saying this is your third
[1:20:13] pool
[1:20:14] and brother said did you see that and
[1:20:16] did you see this and you see that
[1:20:18] i don't feel to say anymore
[1:20:21] i'm like okay i mean you didn't say
[1:20:23] anything anyways
[1:20:27] but i've just went back and read the
[1:20:29] seventh seal about three times in a row
[1:20:31] in the last couple of weeks
[1:20:33] and he absolutely tells you what it is
[1:20:37] amen this opening of the seventh seal is
[1:20:39] declaring that the mighty angel has come
[1:20:41] down and the evidence that he's come
[1:20:43] down is the opening of the seals which
[1:20:45] is the preaching of the thunders proving
[1:20:46] who's here to open the seals that's the
[1:20:49] mystery that's laying under those
[1:20:50] mysterious thunders
[1:20:52] he's telling you right in the seventh
[1:20:54] seal he's telling you that this is the
[1:20:57] third pool this is what will attract the
[1:20:59] rainbow trout this is the word amen this
[1:21:02] was the unwritten word laying under that
[1:21:04] capstone lights never shined on this
[1:21:05] before it wasn't written in the bible
[1:21:07] that this is the interpretation but he's
[1:21:09] come down and took the very bible to
[1:21:11] show you what the unwritten word is
[1:21:15] and this was the opening of the seventh
[1:21:18] seal and brother banham was standing
[1:21:20] there showing you that the seventh seal
[1:21:22] was now open
[1:21:26] but remember when he got to the vision
[1:21:28] of the third pool and the vision of the
[1:21:30] thermal said this will be your third
[1:21:31] pole and you won't tell it to nobody
[1:21:34] and brother brenham said when that
[1:21:36] seventh seal opens it'll be a total
[1:21:38] secret
[1:21:42] bam said
[1:21:43] oh
[1:21:44] go back and read the seventh seal
[1:21:46] brother bam said he's he's in the 17th i
[1:21:48] think it's the seventh seal he says now
[1:21:51] it's been going on all around you and i
[1:21:53] was forbidden to tell you until the
[1:21:55] services were over
[1:21:58] i'm not praise god services are over
[1:22:01] tell me
[1:22:03] that's what he's doing in the seventh
[1:22:04] seal he's telling you
[1:22:06] but he can't come right out and tell you
[1:22:09] he said you won't explain this one he's
[1:22:11] not allowed to explain this one all he
[1:22:13] can do is demonstrate it all he can do
[1:22:16] is show it amen all he can do is
[1:22:18] rehearse the visions and tell you what's
[1:22:20] happened that week and it's been those
[1:22:22] angels and those angels came to me every
[1:22:23] day and i didn't know those things it's
[1:22:25] not a man it's not me this is the
[1:22:27] mysterious part of the week it's been
[1:22:28] going on all around you he can't tell
[1:22:30] you what it is but he can tell you
[1:22:32] what's happened
[1:22:34] because if you can see what's happened
[1:22:36] then you know what it is
[1:22:40] and he comes here to the seventh seal
[1:22:43] he says now
[1:22:45] i better stop there
[1:22:47] i'm going to read the sentence again i
[1:22:49] feel checked not to say no more
[1:22:52] so just remember the seven seal the
[1:22:54] reason it was not open the reason it did
[1:22:55] not reveal it no one should know about
[1:22:57] it
[1:22:58] and i want you to know before i even
[1:23:00] know one word about that
[1:23:02] that the vision come years ago you
[1:23:04] remember then
[1:23:05] and here it is just as these others have
[1:23:07] slides right straight into the word
[1:23:10] exactly where it was
[1:23:12] and god knows my heart i never one time
[1:23:14] thought of such a thing as that
[1:23:16] and there it was it's later than we
[1:23:18] think so those visions was the vision of
[1:23:21] the third pool you won't tell it to
[1:23:23] nobody it'll be a secret
[1:23:25] that slides right into this he said
[1:23:28] oh my just shows it's from god
[1:23:31] if it's exactly in the promises of god
[1:23:33] from the end of the message
[1:23:35] you notice notice now for the end of
[1:23:38] time message this seal
[1:23:40] he's revealed what is the seal the end
[1:23:43] of time message
[1:23:48] have we heard the end of time message
[1:23:50] that's what the seal is
[1:23:52] for the end of time message this seal
[1:23:54] he's revealed all the six seals but he
[1:23:56] don't say nothing about the seven
[1:23:58] and the end time seal when it starts
[1:24:00] will be absolutely totally secret
[1:24:02] according to the bible
[1:24:04] before knowing that remember revelations
[1:24:06] 10 1-7 chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the
[1:24:10] seventh angel's message all the
[1:24:11] mysteries of god should be known we are
[1:24:14] at the end time the opening of the
[1:24:16] seventh seal
[1:24:19] did i miss something
[1:24:21] or did he tell you we're here
[1:24:24] we're at the end time the opening of the
[1:24:26] seventh seal
[1:24:27] this seal is the end of time message
[1:24:31] now listen way says now
[1:24:33] now how did i know the other day last
[1:24:35] sunday a week ago today when i was
[1:24:37] preaching on be humble be humble
[1:24:39] remember god deals in little things
[1:24:42] i didn't realize what i was really
[1:24:43] talking about and now i see it it's in
[1:24:45] such a humble way you think that
[1:24:47] something like that would be revealed to
[1:24:49] the vatican but to come just like john
[1:24:51] the baptist it comes like the birth of
[1:24:52] our lord and a stable glory to god so
[1:24:55] help me the hours at hand we're here
[1:25:03] what's he doing
[1:25:05] he's saying i didn't even know
[1:25:07] like i knew i was supposed to preach
[1:25:08] that i knew it had tied into the message
[1:25:10] but i didn't know coming here to the
[1:25:11] seventh seal i didn't know standing here
[1:25:14] that i that a week ago this sunday a
[1:25:17] week ago that i would be saying be
[1:25:20] humble be humble be humble you would
[1:25:22] think something like this
[1:25:24] what's he talking about
[1:25:27] it would be so grand that something like
[1:25:29] this it would be revealed at the vatican
[1:25:33] or it comes in such a uh
[1:25:35] or but it comes like john the baptist it
[1:25:37] comes like the birth of our lord and the
[1:25:39] stable what's he talking about he's
[1:25:41] talking about the seventh seal what's
[1:25:42] the seventh seal the coming of the lord
[1:25:45] he said you would think something like
[1:25:47] that would be preached in the vatican
[1:25:49] but no it's at this little brick church
[1:25:51] on the corner of eighth and penn street
[1:25:54] it's not preached by the pope what is it
[1:25:56] the greatest message is striking earth
[1:25:58] for the day and it's not preached in the
[1:26:00] big churches and the big halls it's a
[1:26:02] little brick building he said it comes
[1:26:04] like john the baptist what was john the
[1:26:06] baptist he didn't follow in his father's
[1:26:07] footsteps as a priest he didn't go to
[1:26:09] the seminary he didn't have backing he
[1:26:11] was a wild man out in the wilderness
[1:26:13] eating honey and when wild loki's and
[1:26:15] coming out with camel skin over saying
[1:26:17] repent amen repent and and you high
[1:26:19] places be brought down your know places
[1:26:21] be brought up
[1:26:23] what's coming the opening of the seventh
[1:26:24] seal is just like that
[1:26:30] there's two things he talks about
[1:26:32] that the seal is like
[1:26:34] it's like the coming of john the baptist
[1:26:37] and the coming of our lord in the stable
[1:26:43] what's happening
[1:26:46] maybe
[1:26:47] it's the second
[1:26:48] forerunner and the thing that he foreign
[1:26:52] maybe it come just like the first time
[1:26:56] maybe it come like john the baptist and
[1:26:58] our lord in a stable
[1:27:04] how many people were driving by that day
[1:27:06] and knew there was a church service and
[1:27:07] had no clue what was going on
[1:27:12] how many people on earth had no clue
[1:27:13] what was going on
[1:27:15] jesus was
[1:27:16] his mother was coming down amen from
[1:27:19] from nazareth coming out of galilee into
[1:27:22] into bethlehem how many people knew it
[1:27:25] she was carrying the word
[1:27:29] the messiah was within her how many
[1:27:32] people knew it
[1:27:34] it becomes such a simple humble way it
[1:27:36] come from a girl out of nazareth a mean
[1:27:38] city
[1:27:40] it didn't come like they would expect
[1:27:42] this to come a virgin shall conceive
[1:27:44] well what is our conception of a virgin
[1:27:46] it's the virgin nation because the
[1:27:47] glorious nation of israel or it must be
[1:27:49] the virgin daughter of the high priest
[1:27:51] it's always got to be something big but
[1:27:53] when the angel came he came to a little
[1:27:55] virgin that was chosen before the
[1:27:56] foundation of the world amen that was
[1:27:58] going to get water amen a little virgin
[1:28:01] girl in nazareth that nobody knew about
[1:28:03] and very few people cared anything about
[1:28:07] but the time of the promise was going to
[1:28:08] be fulfilled in her and now she was
[1:28:11] going to be carrying the word now the
[1:28:13] word was going to be in her
[1:28:17] and here she comes walking around
[1:28:19] pregnant amen and and she is the
[1:28:21] fulfillment of the prophecy but because
[1:28:24] they didn't expect the prophecy to be
[1:28:25] fulfilled that day their interpretation
[1:28:27] and the fulfillment didn't match so they
[1:28:29] reject the interpretation and start
[1:28:31] rumors and lies about how she was
[1:28:33] impregnated
[1:28:37] they she's
[1:28:39] what are they claiming listen what are
[1:28:40] the lies telling you the lies are
[1:28:42] telling you that that's some man's seed
[1:28:44] in here
[1:28:48] but that was no man's seed in her that
[1:28:50] was the the seed christ amen that was
[1:28:52] within her amen
[1:28:54] and brother benham comes to the seventh
[1:28:56] seal and he says
[1:28:58] you think something like that would be
[1:28:59] preaching the vatican but it comes like
[1:29:01] john the baptist it comes like our lord
[1:29:03] in a stable i'm telling you the same
[1:29:05] thing has happened
[1:29:09] and they've missed it
[1:29:11] god help us not to keep missing it
[1:29:13] open our eyes lord and let us see what's
[1:29:16] happening all around us amen
[1:29:18] let us recognize our day and its message
[1:29:20] let us recognize what you're doing in
[1:29:22] this hour and let us god wash away
[1:29:25] denominational understanding out of our
[1:29:27] mind wash away intellectual reading out
[1:29:29] of our mind and give us your revelation
[1:29:32] on the word eyes to see and ears to hear
[1:29:35] because we must have it in this hour
[1:29:42] it comes
[1:29:44] like john the baptist like the birth of
[1:29:45] our lord and the stable glory to god so
[1:29:47] help me the hour is at hand we're here
[1:29:53] now do you see it
[1:29:57] what a question
[1:29:59] how many of you think in the group he
[1:30:01] was talking about saw it
[1:30:04] now do you see it the truth of god's
[1:30:06] vision the seven angels
[1:30:08] bringing me from the west they were
[1:30:10] coming from the west coming back east
[1:30:12] bringing here for this message tonight
[1:30:19] see
[1:30:20] don't go intellectual on me
[1:30:24] he says those seven angels picked me up
[1:30:26] and brought me back to the east brought
[1:30:27] me here for this message tonight
[1:30:30] you see but
[1:30:31] i thought it was the angels each night
[1:30:34] you missed it
[1:30:36] each night was pointing to the seventh
[1:30:38] seal
[1:30:40] every day the revelation coming forth on
[1:30:42] the seal was pointing he says those
[1:30:44] angels brought me back for this message
[1:30:47] tonight this was the whole purpose the
[1:30:50] opening of the seventh seal
[1:30:52] it was the point of those angels
[1:30:54] visitation it was the reason i was
[1:30:55] caught up and they brought me back here
[1:30:57] for this message
[1:31:00] tonight all those six are pointing to
[1:31:03] this
[1:31:05] the revelation under each one was
[1:31:06] pointing to this they brought me here
[1:31:08] for this message tonight
[1:31:10] now the voice of that great thunder and
[1:31:12] the mission that was brought here has
[1:31:14] been revealed it's proven that it was of
[1:31:16] god just think now i knew not these
[1:31:18] seals
[1:31:20] and they've been revealed this week did
[1:31:22] anybody think of that oh those seven
[1:31:25] angels being this being the message that
[1:31:27] was coming forth them angels bring me
[1:31:29] back here for that
[1:31:32] i say
[1:31:33] thank you lord
[1:31:36] god give me eyes to see
[1:31:38] and ears to hear
[1:31:40] all that you're doing in this day
[1:31:42] let's just stand i feel to stop right
[1:31:44] there
[1:31:45] i got much more but we'll come back
[1:31:46] wednesday for that i want to stop right
[1:31:49] there
[1:31:50] remember
[1:31:51] like i said if you take anything away
[1:31:53] today if you hear anything remember that
[1:31:56] an intellectual reading of the scripture
[1:31:59] can never prepare you for the
[1:32:01] interpretation of the fulfillment of
[1:32:03] that scripture
[1:32:06] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:32:08] revealing himself in the same
[1:32:10] god was hiding himself in the simplicity
[1:32:13] of that little preacher
[1:32:14] in that little building
[1:32:16] and that eight day meeting
[1:32:19] it was simple
[1:32:20] it was as simple as simple could be it
[1:32:23] was a little brick building in a little
[1:32:24] midwest town
[1:32:27] with a a a small of stature preacher
[1:32:30] that had no great tie-ins with any
[1:32:32] denomination or or wasn't orchestrated
[1:32:35] with many other people and in that man
[1:32:37] with limited education and ability he
[1:32:39] was in that little brick building with a
[1:32:41] bunch of regular people
[1:32:44] a bunch of average
[1:32:46] slightly above slightly below it all
[1:32:47] averages out
[1:32:49] a bunch of average people and they were
[1:32:51] all sitting there what was happening
[1:32:53] amen a tremendous event was happening
[1:32:56] amen it was god hiding himself in
[1:32:58] simplicity but revealing himself in the
[1:33:01] same
[1:33:03] it wasn't just the hiding amen it was
[1:33:06] hiding if you don't have these ears eyes
[1:33:08] to see and ears to hear but it was also
[1:33:10] the revealing if you have eyes to see
[1:33:12] and ears to hear how will i see it i'll
[1:33:15] see it and the same thing he hid it in
[1:33:17] is the same thing he'll reveal it in
[1:33:19] it's the same mechanism amen it was john
[1:33:22] the baptist that he hid that forerunner
[1:33:24] coming in but it was john the baptist
[1:33:26] that he revealed the forerunner coming
[1:33:27] in
[1:33:28] it was in the stature of a man amen that
[1:33:31] that
[1:33:32] god hid the coming of messiah it was in
[1:33:35] the stature of a human being that was
[1:33:37] born of a baby that was born in a stable
[1:33:39] amen that had a his mother had a bad
[1:33:41] reputation and a rumor about his birth
[1:33:43] amen and
[1:33:44] and he had nothing going for him in life
[1:33:48] he was simple listen we think of jesus
[1:33:50] christ and we love him and adore him
[1:33:52] amen because of what he's done for us
[1:33:54] but if you live back in that day he
[1:33:55] would have been a regular person walking
[1:33:57] down a regular road dressed in regular
[1:33:59] garb
[1:34:02] the scripture says there was nothing no
[1:34:04] beauty that we should behold him there
[1:34:05] was nothing to attract your attention to
[1:34:07] him physically
[1:34:10] but it was the still small voice
[1:34:12] attracted the attention
[1:34:15] how many people walked past jesus in his
[1:34:17] lifetime
[1:34:20] rubbed shoulders with him walked through
[1:34:21] the market with him and had no idea who
[1:34:22] he was
[1:34:24] god was hiding
[1:34:27] god was hiding the coming of the messiah
[1:34:29] in that vessel simple
[1:34:31] but he was revealing the coming of the
[1:34:32] messiah in that vessel
[1:34:35] simple
[1:34:36] god hidden
[1:34:38] and revealed
[1:34:39] in simplicity
[1:34:41] i think sometimes we make it too
[1:34:43] complicated
[1:34:45] when it's really easy
[1:34:48] it was god it was christ himself opening
[1:34:51] those seals
[1:34:53] revealing
