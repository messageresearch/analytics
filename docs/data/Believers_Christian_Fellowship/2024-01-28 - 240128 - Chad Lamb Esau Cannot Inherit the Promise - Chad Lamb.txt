you that you've drawn us you've gathered us once again we're so grateful to be here to worship you together in spirit and in truth we pray God now that as we turn to the preaching of the word that you would come on the scene and that you would begin to minister Lord through this vessel of clay I yield myself to you Lord and ask that you would take control and may you speak the words of eternal life that we're so hungry for that we so desire may you shape us and mold us Lord by your own hand for you're the master Craftsman and Lord you know the work that you're doing in our lives and I pray God that you would come and shape shape us Lord according to that image you had of us before the foundation of the world may we move into that image day by day Lord Lesson by lesson Prayer by prayer may we come into what you've ordained for us to be Lord may it in in it all may we be found pleasing to you Lord fulfilling your desire in our life that's what we want Lord help us to surrender in a greater way this morning and give you first place in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all this morning sir certainly good to be here together amen let's look in Genesis chapter 25 Genesis CH 25 verse 19 God bless you Sister Joyce it's good to see you I didn't know if you were a visitor if you belonged here or what you've been gone a long time but God bless you it's good to have you here amen uh Genesis 25 verse 19 and these are the generations of Isaac Abraham's son Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to wife the daughter of Bethel the Syrian of padanaram the sister deben the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger amen God bless you as you're seated keep your places open in the Bible there uh God bless you brother Carson and sister Sharon good to see you guys here again praise the Lord I saw a few visitors God bless you all we're very welcome to be here with us amen God has been very very good to us amen I certainly enjoyed the tape Wednesday night it did me a world of good to hear Brother Brenham give his life story again and it just does something to me to hear that voice and to hear how God you know took care of his son in order to take care of this sonen and it does me a world of good and I say God help us to be surrendered in a greater way so you can do your purpose do you remember last Sunday we talked about the the the title of the sermon was the twin within we were talking about the the these two uh twins that were in the womb of Rebecca she she she wanted to conceive she was uh Desiring to conceive and when she did uh her husband inquired the Lord for her and and the Lord was entreated uh on her behalf and she conceived but then she said if it's thus why am I in such turmoil if this is a good thing why am I so why is it why am I so torn apart on the inside and she inquired of the Lord and the Lord answered her he says because there's two nations in thy wound and there's two peoples in thy wound and if you remember as we begin to talk about that we begin to see that in US is two persons amen amen and we we we went through the message we're going to rehearse some of that but this morning i' I'd like to uh take a subject on Esau cannot inherit the promise Esau cannot inherit the promise and we want to bring this home it's always got to come home if it's ever going to do us any good it's got to come personal and so so we see now that from her would come these two Nations within her was two Nations and two peoples and they were at War and within her was a struggle between these two and brother B said this is a dying spirit and a dying body but now you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two Natures in you at one time now the nature of the spirit of the Lord when you're born again you're not born of the physical like the baby but what's happened the spiritual Birth has come to you so you can't be in two bodies ones but you can have two Natures in you you can have the old nature of the world but you can have the new Nature by the new birth right and so the this is just a few review quotes from last time he says these two boys if if we noticed their nature one of them was a spiritual man that was Jacob and the carnal man was Esau but they were both religious and that same thing has took place all down through the age the carnal and the spiritual Esau represents the man of the earth natural religious inclined but never able it wasn't in him to do it he couldn't do it he never was in him to be able to climb past the things of the world the carnal things but Jacob it was just so easy for him to do it and so now remember we're not we're not talking about two people out here we're talking about two people right here so keep that in mind the whole time we're talking and don't ever put it anywhere else in fact the more that I study this and the more that I look at this I realize that I don't have any problems with any anybody in the world there's only one problem I have and the problem is right here this is the biggest problem I have to deal with and in fact I am so consumed now with the problem that I have I'm not I mean I I really don't have any time to worry about anybody else amen and so this whole attitude of criticizing others and watching others it's just a distraction technique of the devil he can get you pointing out flaws and everybody else and while you're doing that you're not seeing the biggest flaw you're you're the one with the you know looking at the splinters in people's eyes with the beam sticking out of yours that Jesus was talking about amen and and it becomes foolish now when I look back over my life and I realize how childish how foolish how deceived I've been most of my life trying to find fault everywhere else and make sure I avoided fault everywhere else you know I don't want to be deceived and I don't want to I don't want to be you know I don't want to intermingle here cuz I don't want to be deceived and I don't want to go there and I don't want to talk to that one and and the deception was working right in my own head the voice of deception was going on right inside of me amen so we realize that that Esau is a type of the natural man and and the carnal the earthy and Jacob the spiritual and Esau could never step into the spiritual Realms no matter how much he wanted to he could never do it but Jacob it was just so easy and you realized that Jacob wasn't always good hope we understand that Jacob wasn't always good amen but Jacob that he could just step into the spiritual when he went to bethl all he did was lay his head on a rock and the heavens open and he saw a ladder he wasn't pressing he wasn't trying it just happened to him because that that's his nature that was his seed he was predestinated for that purpose if we go over to Romans let's turn to Romans chapter n Romans chapter 9:6 and in Romans chapter 9 beginning at verse 6 say not as though the word of God ha taken n effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of Promise are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated so I wanted to draw out of here in verse um eight that is they which are the children of the flesh they are not the children of God anden we realize that this flesh has to be changed right this flesh is not inheriting the promise until it's changed right this old this old nature amen this old human spirit will One Day Fly Away and be no more amen it's the it's the seed of promise that was on the inside that comes by the that comes to life by the new birth that's the one that inherits the promise will I have a body of Flesh absolutely but it's not going to be this one it's going to be this one changed this one doesn't inherit the promise praise God in the message communion brother B says I was saying this taking for myself like you was going to say William brandham well 40 years ago the William brandham it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say William brandham he was a rank Rascal see because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham in their nature I was a siner I come to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature prescy predestinated was in there by God in this same body see two Natures in there well I only catered to one as it growed I grewed as a baby d d first thing you know I became a liar became everything else that's a sinner because I I was raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of Life all the time further down he says what it was it there was another William brandham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there praise be to God I'm so glad that God prayed something else down inside of me and I realized that Esau or the Esau nature doesn't inherit the promise but it's the spiritual seed that inherits it's the seed of promise that will will make the inheritance amen and when we were reading when we were reading back in Genesis 25 amen when she was wondering what this turmoil was going on inside her why she was being torn apart amen he he said there's two peoples and there's two Nations inside of you and the one shall be stronger than the other amen but the Elder Shall Serve the younger and we realize when we got to this part and uh last week we begin to realize that what came first was my natural birth amen but what came second was my spiritual birth but praise God there's a promise that the Elder Shall Serve the younger that I do not have to serve this body I'm no longer subject to sin I'm no longer enslaved to the flesh amen but now there's another life inside by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that will take control of this outer man amen and the the Elder the natural birth will become subject to the New Birth oh I believe it I believe that's still true today amen that the the the the the uh first born the natural birth the natural man will become subject to the spiritual man to the new birth and I thank God for that amen now let's go back to Genesis 25 Genesis 25 and verse 24 in Genesis 25: 24 it says and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came out red all over like a hairy garment and they called his name Esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was three score years old when she bar them and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob man brother B tells us a lot about Esau and Jacob and he he has a lot to say in one of the places he says and we see that this is a mixed multitude the two two sons of Isaac and Rebecca represent the world over every time there's a Revival there's twins born every time we have a Revival twins are born Esau and Jacob were twins one of them was a man after the world the other was spiritual now Esau was just a good a man as Jacob was if you looked at him he liked to take care of his old blind Father which was a prophet he was a good boyn morally I guess all right and he helped worked and perhaps Jacob was just a mama's boy hung around mama and just we called a little sister and so Esau was was loved a man of the world naturally never cared nothing about the birthright and we see that in brother and over and over in many places says Esau was the better man and Jacob was the little Shyer and he was the one pulling tricks and and Jacob was the was the better man and he was better to his daddy and he worked and he did things and and Jacob he said hung around his mom was a mama's boy and that's the title every boy's ever wanted you to be a mama's boy and a big but but we see the the way man views things and the way we see things in the natural is not the way God views it and sometimes the Deception comes in because Esau was a good man Esau wasn't evil in the way we would think evil he wasn't Wicked in the way we would think Wicked amen but he was a good man he was a good son he was good to his parents he was good to his father he he hung around and helped out D and and and you could look in the naturals brother B said he was a he was a much better man than than Jacob but that's not what God was looking at because when it came down to the rubber meets the road Jacob was willing to give up the birth right or Esau was willing to give up the birthright but that's all that Jacob desired and God was looking at something deeper amen than just how nice and how friendly and how personable a person was God can absolutely change all of those things and he did change it in Jacob Jacob underwent a transformation when he wrestled with the angel and that transformation affected him the rest of his life God can deal with that amen but but what God can't deal with is somebody that doesn't have a desire to the birthright that doesn't value the word that doesn't want the word above everything else amen so God was looking different than man man would look and say Esau's the good boy he's the better one Jacob he's a little bit this and Esau he's all like that and we can make our designation amen and the problem sometimes in our flesh is if we've been given a good disposition and we're kind and we've been trained with manners and we're nice we're genuinely nice and friendly and have friends and do good deeds we can mistake that for being spiritual and it's a mistake we can make especially growing up Amen in a good home and growing up in the right atmosphere we can make the mistake that being spiritual is equal to being nice but being being nice is not equal to being spiritual the world is full of nice people remember when brother brandom compared the kind old priest with with Jesus Christ amen the kind old priest who when you were without money and dad was sick and without work he come and gave you some money the kind old priest that was there to dedicate you at eight days old and the kind old priest that married your mom and dad and and and you never heard him raise his voice but here goes Jesus like a mad man running through the temple throwing over the money changers tables and whipping them on the back with a with a cord whip that he made himself when you just look at that in the natural I mean who looks the most spiritual but one was a fulfillment of the word amen and the other one was denying the word so even in ourselves sometimes we can become deceived because remember Esau and Jacob were both religious and we're born religious we don't become religious amen that's embeded that's that's built into the the human nature and so it's going to take more than just being nice and having a nice disposition and treating people nice now I'm not saying that Christians shouldn't treat people nice and have a nice disposition absolutely we need to be changed we need to be molded into the image of Jesus Christ but you can't just leave it at that natural carnal level there's something that's much deeper that's important if we look at verse 29 here in Genesis 25 go to verse 29 and Jacob saw pottage and Esau came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I'm faint therefore was his name called Edom and Jacob said sell me uh Jacob and Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright and Esau said behold I am at the point to die and what profit shall this Birthright do to me and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swore unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his Birthright I I this terminology is so important to me because when you think Esau his Birthright you would think that Esau grew up all of his life thinking I hate being the first born I don't want nothing to do with the inheritance I don't want to collect everything that my dad has when he dies it wasn't that kind of despising the birthright but when it came down to it when it was his natural life or the birthright he was willing to give up the birthright to preserve his natural life and Jacob little Shyer that he was and mama's boy that he was there was one thing that was locked inside of his heart he had to have that Birthright cuz that Birthright links to the promise it links to the word it links to Abraham it links to everything else it's a link to Jesus Christ amen and so there was something in him moving him and I doubt he understood or comprehended what it all was but something in him had to have that word and had to have that new birth and had to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and had to have the Assurance the birthright was the assurance amen and Jacob had to have it amen and he was willing to do whatever to have that Birthright and he was also willing to do whatever to have the blessing amen but Esau when it came down to his natural life or the birthright he took his natural life and he said what good is the birthright if I die it shows he didn't understand there was nothing in him to connect to the birthright amen because even if you die the birthright is still in effect right amen I would rather have this Birthright of the Holy Ghost this Birthright of the word of Christ I'd rather have this Birthright than anything else in life than my natural life then whatever because this is just a vapor this is just a Mist this isn't perfection this is not what I'm living for but that Birthright holds everything for me and so Jacob was moved inside that he had to have the birth right and he would get it by whatever means he had to get it if he made a fool out of himself if every he thought he was wrong whatever he had to have it but Esau so lightly gave it away and the Bible says he despised his Birthright he had no he didn't put the proper value on it and so the problem with Esau is he was natural carnal it could never break past the natural what good is this if I'm dead that seems logical but it's not true it's logical but it's not true in wisdom versus faith brother B says Jacob and Esau or Esau and Jacob was a perfect timee both of them religious both of them twins Esau was the ecclesiastical type he was a man that was smart had a good moral standing things like that but he didn't have no use for that Birthright Jacob didn't care what he had to do just so he got the birthright didn't didn't care what his friends thought of him didn't care what what anybody else thought of him he had to have this Birthright amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 12 together I just want you to see I like for us to look together at how the Bible views things what God's Viewpoint is because when we still view things in a carnal way and we don't realize the we don't realize what a terrible thing this was and in Hebrews chapter 12 let's go to verse 14 Hebrews 12:14 says follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright you know the Bible calls him a fornicator or a profane person the Bible says Esau was a profane person and you think the man was dying he was faint and ready to perish he was going to die uh what was so bad about giving his brother The Inheritance so that he could survive but the Bible the the book of Hebrews now is recognizing that he was a profane what made him profane because he was bad to his daddy because he went around stealing a bunch of stuff and murdering people what made him profane is he chose the natural things over the spiritual things that's what made him profane not evil Wicked but natural natural life natural existence natural substance over the spiritual things he goes on to say uh for there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsal to meat sold his Birthright for you know that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears years I've been through this with you before but I I want us to focus in on this because we're going to go down to the blessing now we looked at the we looked at the birthright we're going to go to the blessing and it says he was rejected uh is let's go back to verse 17 for we know that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears now it didn't say that he repented said he found no place of repentance though he sought it with tears and immediately when we read these things we think How could somebody not repent if they're really sorry and if they're coming with tears and it looks like he's repenting but when we go back and read the story Esau was not repenting there was no repentance in him it says when he sought for repentance he he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears this wasn't his repentance he wasn't looking for repentance he was looking for his dad to repent because his dad had given the blessing already and he could find no place of repentance he could not change Jacob's he could not change Isaac's mind on the situation it was already fixed although he sought it with tears he himself was never repentant he himself was never sorry he himself was not apologizing or making it right he was asking Isaac to change and Isaac to repent let's go back and read it so we we have an understanding of what we're talking about Genesis 27 Genesis 27 now we know in the story of Genesis uh Rebecca comes to him and she finds out that that that uh uh Isaac is ready to bless Esau he told him to go out and get venison so I can bless you and and he goes hunting and and she comes up with this scheme where they they can deceive Isaac CU Isaac is now blind and and they they they she takes Jacob she puts the goat skins on him to make him hairy like his brother she cooks up the meat he takes it into his father he deceives his father and his father blesses him and he gets the blessing that was intended for Esau which which Isaac intended for Esau God always knew where it was going to land right so let's pick up the story here let's go to verse 35 let's read it in verse 35 now let's go to verse 34 and when Esau heard the word of words of his father he cried with a great exceeding bitter cry and he said unto his father bless me even me also oh my father and he said thy brother came with subtility and ha taken away thy blessing and he and he said is not he rightly named Jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my Birthright and behold now he ha taken away my blessing and he and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me and Isaac answered and said unto Esau behold I have made him thy Lord and all his Brethren have I given to him for servants and with corn and wine have I sustained him and what shall I do now unto thee my son and Esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also oh my father and Esau lifted up his voice and wept what was he weeping for cuz he was sorry for giving up the birthright for he was no he was sorry cuz he missed out on a blessing this is not true repentance this is a carnal Christian the carnal Christian always wants the benefits amen and here's Esau he's sorry for himself he wants his dad he says is there not yet a re is there not yet a blessing for me he says I've already given him everything I've already given him everything and he says is there not yet do you not yet reserve a blessing for me and he lifted up his voice and wept this is no repentance for despising the birthright this is a man who's sorry because he didn't get something amen and both of these men are religious but we find out that both of these both of these men are in me there's one who wants all the benefit all the blessing all the it's the reality we want we come to God and we want God to heal us and give us money and give us jobs and give us all these and all the promises and all the blessings and all of that but the question is do you do do you desire the birthright more than anything else in your life and you desire the blessing you have to desire the birthright and the blessing Esau despised the birthright but he was weeping for the blessing how many Christians are despising the word but weeping for the blessing still wanting the blessing asking for a place of repentance he could find no place for Isaac to repent found no place even though he sought it with tears there was no tears over giving up the birth right there was no sorrow over giving up the birth right there was only sorrow over losing out on a blessing said God I do not want to be that kind of carnal believer amen I want the birthright to be everything to me I want the blessing too just like Jacob wanted the blessing I want them both amen but how can I have how can I have a desire for the blessing without a desire for the birth right that makes me a carnal believer amen you could say well yeah I've known a lot of carnal Believers in my day so have I there's one right here I've known one who's been a carnal believer and been crying out for the blessings and crying out and crying out and not realizing I was selfish cries with selfish motives with selfish ideas amen because I'd got my self exalted as the main purpose of my existence was so self could be comfortable self could be exalted self could have everything say God help us God help us I what what I do not like is when I'm preaching things like these and and I know it happens to all as we go down the line preaching you think I saw that before I've seen that before and over there and over there I mean all you got to do is look in the mirror if you've W ever see this before if you I've seen it before and I'm ashamed of it but I want the spiritual things I want the natural blessings too but I want the spiritual things amen when we come to the story of Cain and Abel all the way back in the beginning these two boys they come to a time where they're required to bring a worship It's Time To Worship the Lord and they're going to bring a sacrifice and we know the story super well but but we know that Cain brings of the fruit of the field and and he makes a pretty Altar and he does you know all the works of his hands he presents to the Lord and Abel he brings a lamb he brings blood and God has respect to Abel's offering but not to kain's and Cain was wroth and his countenance had fallen and the Lord comes to him and says why is thy countenance fallen and and all of these we we we know the whole story but then he he says just do as thy brother and it'll be well with thee God even gives him in Mercy all you have to do is just follow your brother's lead and it'll be well with thee so he goes out and talks to his brother and he has a conversation with Abel and after the conversation he slays Abel and brother bam says he slayed him because he was jealous of him cuz God had accepted him and didn't accept Cain because Cain Cain's whole religion was built around Cain Cain's whole religion was built about around what Cain wanted to offer what Cain thought was beautiful what Cain thought was acceptable and all the works of Cain's hands he was a carnal believer remember these are twins again but Abel didn't offer anything of himself he didn't offer his Works he didn't offer for his ideas he waited for Revelation and by spiritual Revelation he realized it was blood blood is what he's seeking and he takes a little lamb and he brings a little lamb up and he slays the lamb and Spills the blood and God accepts his offering and rejects Cain Cain's was put forth with effort with Beauty with with class with style with all of this stuff but God rejected it and accepted Abel's and that infuriated Cain cuz Cain was a carnal believer and couldn't understand how easily Abel could slip into the realm of Revelation catch something from God and know exactly what was the right offering without effort without work without striving without without planting and sewing and read without all the things that Cain had to do Cain put forth a tremendous amount of effort Abel put forth very little effort but it was just so easy for him and Cain hated him and Cain slew him but let's look at what the scripture says about that in first John in 1 John chapter 3 1 John chap 3 and verse 11 for this is the message that you've heard from the beginning that we should love one another another not as Cain who was of the wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore or why did he slay him what wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous why did he slay him because his Works were evil what works not slaying we know slaying is evil he's talking about the works that he did before he slew his brother and what were the evil works that came did brought fruit to the Field built an altar God why were they Wicked because he did it all for himself he brother said he loved God he was religious he had a desire to worship God but he worshiped God according to his own understanding and according to his own dictates according to his own desire he was a carnal believer and his Works were considered Wicked Abel's Works were considered righteous because what did Abel do Abel offered according to Revelation am and he was considered righteous oh I want to live on the spiritual side Prophet says in the true Easter seal he says but in the Garden of Eden where they had only two boys the decision was forced upon man to make a decision anything is done to show his true color what he is to show what he is inside of him now we find that the that the time came between Cain and Abel that the decision had to be forced because that the time of worship had come and each boy had to provide a way to make a worship to God and if you'll notice between right and wrong there's just one little breath of difference and the wrong in the last days has been prophesied that it would be so close to the right that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible between right and wrong wrong the there's a hair's breath between right and wrong there's just a hairs breath between your old nature being religious serving God the best of your understanding the best of your ability and doing all you can to serve God Amen for the blessings and so you can make it to heaven so you can have everything that's promised there's just a hair's breath between that and serving him by revelation in actually catching what God wants and worshiping him in spirit and in truth just a hair's breath one is between the outside man and the inner man that's how close it is the outside man can't please God because he doesn't have faith it's only the inside man that can please God because he has faith and faith is a revelation brother B says now just watch how cunning that fellow is now he's just well they're just like Judas and Jesus they're both brothers in their tribe just like Esau and Jacob The Crow and the dove sitting on the same root and everything is a twin in this great Warfare that we're in everything is a twin praise God in uh the message a man running from the presence of the Lord he says you can see people today there is two spirits and one of them one of them is the Holy Spirit the other one is the Unholy Spirit and the one is governed by that and both of them religious now yeah that's the strange part they're both religious and just like Esau and Jacob was both religious like Cain and Abel was both religious like Judas and Jesus both religious both religious and we see it today both sides religious Esau was religious he was a profane person Cain was religious and his Works were Wicked I don't want to be just religious and carnal I want to be spirit spiritual I Want To Live From the Inside Man and I want the outside man become subject I want the Elder to serve the younger and I want I want the new birth to rule everything in my life and I want to be tipped off and recognized listen I I think this is what's so important and what's become so real to me I want to I want to go into a little Divergence here this is the subject I've been really wanting to get to today and I want to talk about preparation for a millennial Reign but when I want to realize I think we all it's healthy for us when we come to a realization that every thought that passes through my brain is not safe I think we'll be a lot better off when we realize that every thought that passes through my brain is not safe it's not the Holy Ghost it's not right amen because why because the Satan brother B said can put thoughts in your mind he can't read your mind but he can put thoughts in your mind he can whisper to that old carnal nature brother B said you'll always have on the outside man an old sticky Cocker nature amen and what becomes the most deceptive thing to us is when the Satan Whispers in our ear but he uses our voice so the voice ringing in your head is your own voice and you don't realize this is a lie of the devil trying to push me away from the word right and I think it's good for us all to realize amen that that there's still two Natures in one body amen and I got to make sure I don't cater to that one but I read that one subject to the to the New Birth nature amen because this is the one one that we want to rule am and and that's where really the reality is that's where our Deception comes from that's right where was Lucifer deceived he was deceived by his own brightness he it was self deception and so we want to make sure that every thought comes back to the word and and not just every thought comes back to the word in that way that I can find a scripture to match my thought I want to be very very careful with that that because remember when the prophet got offended after he preached the seals and he got upset because of his complex and his rejection as a child when they didn't hear the message and rejected him he is working up this plan where he was going to go up to Northern British Colombia because he was hurt he was offended and he thought they had heard his message and what did he use as his justification for going up there for tricking his wife and going up and and leaving everything and staying up there until God gives him a message he used the scriptures yes remember when the devil came to Jesus in the Temptation in the wilderness he used the scriptures so you got to be very careful just because a thought passes through your head and you can find a scripture to match it does not mean that that came from God Satan can give you scriptures too and brother brandom in his hurt in his human nature wanting to escape from the pain amen he found justification listen this is a man who loves God this is a man who knows the word he's not just going to run off and do something like this he needs this is I hope you don't think I'm rude speaking about the Prophet this way but in order for to make a step like that he's got to have justification and he's looking for justification to overcome the own alarm that's in his heart that's where every one of us are we have that little alarm in our heart we know that this isn't right but we ignore that alarm and we look for justification in the scriptures or in the message and guess what Satan will give you the justification you need to move Beyond The Alarm because the problem is that that move that brother Brenham was make that move was for self right and he had to die to self and acknowledge that he was wrong repent of his wrong share it with everybody and ask God to change him so he could go back into the ministry so don't this is what's so close with these two spirits and they're both religious really what it comes down to brother bam told us he said what God is judging is our motive and our objective what we need to do is finally get real we need to get down to the bottom of it and get to the reality what why do I want to do this really why not the religious terms I'm tacking to it but really why do I want to do this for self- protection for self-promotion for self gain amen prise Lord friends I think this is the only way we're going to overcome amen we start recognizing the enemy that's in the mirror and the greatest battle that's ever fought is going to be fought where not outside of me it's going to be fought in me and if I'm going to win this battle that's fought in me I'm going to have to learn the tactics of the devil and you say you just you just have to know the word that's absolutely true you have to know the word but don't forget the devil's going to use the word so you're going to have to know more than just the word you're going to have to have the spirit of God to help you discern your your own desire laying beside underneath your decision that's the deception right there it's not the deception is not what somebody's uh trying to get you to do no the deception is what's laying in your heart why you want to do that think about what happened with Eve Eve uh uh in the Garden of Eden amen she everything was perfect everything was in Paradise but there was those two trees that were standing there and she was given an instruction don't take the don't partake of this tree everything else is open and everything else is free there was only one commandment don't partake of this tree and the serpent come along and began to entice her and what he began to do is he began to create a desire in her amen he began to paint a picture that was different for her until within her she wanted to know what that tree was like amen and then she began to justify it and she began to say well she looked at the tree and it was good for food it was pleasant to the eye and it was a tree to be desired to make make one wise and then after her inspection or scrutiny she couldn't find any problem with it the problem with the tree was he said don't partake of it but the the Satan worked in her a desire a need to know something he was telling her he knows God does know that when you partake of it you shall be like Gods knowing good and evil now all of a sudden he created a need inside of her when this woman had zero need she didn't need for anything she didn't need for food she didn't need need housing she didn't need money she needed nothing she had perfect love perfect Faith perfect peace perfect everything what did she need what did she need she needed nothing so what did Satan do he created in her a need now you need to know now you're lacking you don't have something you could have you think he doesn't pull the same tricks on us yes yes and the one who needed nothing all of a sudden needed to know and she was willing to partake of that dream I think if we could lose self and if we could lose need we would be Invincible am yes if all I ever needed was Christ in it period if I had no other need than Christ and if I could completely die to myself there's not a thing in the world the devil could do with us right but those are the two things that keep tripping us up let's go to first Thessalonians chapter 4 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse one furthermore then we beseech you Brethren exhort and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as ye have received of us how you ought to walk to please God so you would abound more and more for you know that for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor we read this before and we talked about how God wants us to possess our vessel he does not want our vessel to possess us so all the passions of the flesh are not to be possessing us we're not to be possessed by that but we're supposed to possess our vessel and so let's go to Revelations chap 20 with that scripture in mind I want to keep building on that and now I'm getting really moving past review and getting into the part that I really wanted to share about Esau kennot and herit the promise Revelations 20 verse 5 in verse 5 says but the rest of the Dead live not again until the the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so we know that those who come in the first resurrection they're going to Reign we believe that we be we'd be part of that group we will reign with him for a thousand years and he's we know that he's going to reign with a rod of iron and we go over to Revelation chap 2 now Revelation chap 2 and verse 26 says and he that overcometh and keepeth my works until the end to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessel of a Potter shall he be broken to Shivers even even as I received of my father so we know that he that overcometh he that's in part in the first resurrection Will Rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years he will rule and reign with a rod of iron but here he's talking to the thoan church age and I think it's marvelous that he gave this to the thotran church age because this is the church age that was in the Dark Ages this is in the peak of the power of the Catholic church when they snuffed out everything that didn't believe they were the Holy Roman Empire they had power over Nations power over Kings this is the time of the inquisitions and everything else amen when they martyred so many and they and they this is when the bride tree was ate down to just a stump and everything was gone and almost no life left and what was it this was the ox age this was the age when they completely surrendered their life and gave themselves up even unto death that's right but he told them you who in this age have overcome and surrendered your life and laid down your life and given to this power you shall rule with a rod of iron amen I think that's amazing that this group who surrendered all they're the ones who get to rule with a rod of iron when will they rule with a rod of iron and when will they rule the nations with a rod of iron I believe in the millennial Reign I believe when they when Christ rules with a rod of iron and so you see what it took for them to get to that place they had to overcome what they would overcome the Dark Ages they had to overcome self they had to surrender all they had to give the ultimate sacrifice their life I was looking at this and this is where my meditation has been lately I was looking at this subject of the millennial Reign and this is when Christ returns to set up his kingdom physically upon the Earth and we rule and reign with him we're part of that Kingdom we're part of the ruling Authority amen we're part of the Kingdom that gives rulership and there's even discussion in the scriptures where where there's even uh uh we we even take part in the Govern government so that if even Egypt doesn't come up to the Feast of Tabernacles there'll be no reain for them there'll be retribution there'll be correction there'll be teaching there'll be instruction there'll be all of this going on in the Millennium and we'll be part of it amen he told them that you know I'll give I'll make you ruler over cities and when are these these promises going to take place and when are these rewards going to come in the millennial Reign but where my meditation was is how in the world am I going to sit on the throne with Jesus Christ and Rule and Reign for a thousand years when I can't rule this little plot of Earth he's given me today what makes me think that I'm going to rule in the Millennium with Christ when he's asked me to possess one little clump of dirt one little corner one posty stamp size of Earth and he's given not a city not a village not a town not even a household he has given me one little clump of his dirt creation and he's asking me to rule that and I can't even bring this clump of dirt to subjection to the word what makes me think I'm going to rule and reign in the Millennium if we're not able amen by the grace of God and by the spirit of God to bring this dirt into subjection to the word by the by the authority of the word and the power of the spirit what makes us think we're fit to rule and Reign for a thousand years I say God help me to get it right now amen help me to take that word and bring how am I going to bring Egypt subjection to the word and say Egypt if you don't come to Feast of Tabernacles you get no rain when I'm not coming subject to all of the word what hypocrisy say God help me you've got to help me God I I I'm tired of looking everywhere else for what's wrong I'm finding plenty of wrong right here I've got enough wrong right here to preoccupy the rest of my days on Earth I'm pretty sure of that but but now I realize what my goal is because what does he want in the great plan of God he had a three-fold purpose and the second part is to get preeminence in a man what does he want he wants full control right here he wants somebody to give him first place and I want to be I want to be the patch of earth that is dedicated and designated to Jesus Christ the word alone and there's one spot on Earth where God is glorified one spot where his name is well spoken of one spot where he's glorified one spot where he rules and Reigns if it's not anywhere else in the earth I want it to be in this earth right [Applause] here that's my goal that's what I'm working for that's what I'm striving for is to keep this flesh subdued and let Christ take leadership rulership ownership over this flesh I want to read a couple scriptures just in line with what I'm thinking if you can turn with me to Proverbs 25 and I I hope that the meditation that I have and the things I've been dwelling on they hit home and they they become a reality and you understand my heart and what I'm saying Proverbs 25 28 Proverbs 25:28 he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and Without Walls you mean we're supposed to have rule over our own spirit I thought that's what the Holy Ghost was for is to come so I don't have to ever make any decisions and I don't you realize the coming of the Holy Ghost is the power to help you live a Christian life amen it brings the word to life in you it quickens the seed of God inside of you amen but just because you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and have the indwelling of the Holy Ghost God never never took away your Power of Choice you can still choose which nature you cater to amen Proverbs 16 Proverbs 16:32 and Proverbs 16:32 he says he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh the city we've got some work to do right here let's go back to Revelation chapter 3 Revelation CH 3 verse 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and him sat down with my father and his throne Jesus is here in leoda this is the leodan church age and he's saying to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne to overcome what to overcome leysia what's the leodan condition saying I'm rich increased with goods and have need of nothing and not realizing or blind miserable poor wretched and all of those things and he that overcometh you can overcome that condition amen and overcome the deception in the world and I say this and overcome the deception in yourself because that's where the problem was in leoda the problem was a self-deception i they they thought they were rich and increased with goods and had need of nothing and they did not realize that they were blind poor miserable naked and wretched they didn't know the problem problem in leod deia was self-deception and isav would open our eyes to that and this message is our IAB friends to him that overcometh I'll Grant to sit with me in my throne and then the question that I ask is what is his throne and we know in the future that he's going to take the Throne of his father David but brother bam tells us where his throne is back in 1958 in the message the UN Unity of one God and the one church say every man born on Earth is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's right so in the carnal adamic nature how can a man achieve anything only by through his intellectuals but when he comes to be a new creature and the old man has passed out and the new man Christ takes his throne in the human heart when life looks different then then he starts on a new road from his own selfish motives till the big ideas to make himself something big he starts right towards Calvary to recognize God then all his objective his motive his achievement and all that he is lays in the glory of the Cross where Christ paid the price for human life Christ is our life then in in 1961 in Revelation 4 he says now we're living in another age Glory oh I love this age don't you now God has a mercy seat today to be guarded you believe that where's The Mercy Seat found in the heart of man when did come into the heart of man at the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost which is God came into the human heart is that right so now where is his throne his throne is in the heart of man his throne is where the mercy seat is and he says he that overcome can sit with me in my Throne hey I know that we're going to sit with him on the millennial Throne I know that I believe that with all my heart amen but he's now sitting in another Throne he's sitting in this Throne amen and we're supposed to be joint HS and we're supposed to rule and reign with him amen is that right we rule and reign with him for a thousand years if we're going to rule and reign with him for a thousand years why don't we rule and reign with him now in conjunction with him now where's his throne his throne is in the human heart where's The Mercy Seat in the human heart when did it come in the human heart at Pentecost he wants us to climb up on his throne and Rule and reign with him and he wants us to judge the nations with him amen why don't we start judging now why don't we start ruling now and you say brother Chad where are you going to rule I've got enough territory right here this is all the territory I can handle right now in the future he may give me a Village he may give me cities he may whatever but for right now this is my training ground for the Millennium I'm in premillennial training camp right now and this boot camp is tough Brothers I'm telling you it's a tough one and I keep getting tripped up by spirits and I get tripped up by my own motives you know the subjects that I'm given the rule is only one subject that's the old carnal nature of Chad I have one subject to rule over and that subject keeps tripping me up and he pulls little deceiving games on me and this old nature of Chad keeps tripping me up and I haven't yet outsmarted him completely amen you think you think we're fit to go sit on the throne of the whole world and be part we're so proud true I tell you what I make myself sick sometimes when I stop and really think about what I really am on my own what my flesh really is and what my carnal and then think of some of the pompous things that I've said and some of the attitudes that I pull I make myself sick that's right you know what I want to do I want to abase this man and base this man and aase this man and I want the word to rule the word to rule the word to rule and I want to rule in way rain with Christ and I want to make my decisions my choices I want to bring this body subject to the word can't ask for cities God I think I'll take three cities I think I'm ready can you imagine I just sometimes I feel like I feel like a little kid talking to God sometimes God I'm ready for the millennial Reign and God's looking at us thinking listen you you haven't even tackled your own desires you haven't even conquered the own L your own lust of the flesh I you have you haven't even kept your hands from touching what shouldn't touch you haven't even stopped your eyes from looking at what it shouldn't look at you think you're going to rule over a city you haven't even got enough dominion over the territory I give you to turn your head when you ought to turn your head Son of God and you think you're going to rule over cities sometimes we need to go back to kindergarten and get the ABC's right praise God so we we realize that I I'm I believe we're in training for reigning I believe this is it but I've been given an unruly territory sometimes I feel unfairly treated I got the genetics of mom and dad and I got Grandpa coming back and I got willfulness and all these things and been injected in me through the genetics and and I sometimes like God this body you gave me to rain over see the point I think we got plenty to do I think we got plenty to pray about I think we got plenty to line up to the word God gave us a good training ground brother B said in the God of this evil age he said we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve she is not that type of woman and she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact Again by the same thing amen not just the denominational truth or something but every word amen we're not going to escape it we can't leave it back in the Garden of Eden but the garden of Eden's here the same the the same decision is now the same two trees are present today amen and the question is which one are we going to choose and that's the choice that we get to make brother says in the Sixth Seal he says now you tonight are the same place that Adam and Eve was in the Garden of Eden you have a right you're a free moral agent you can go to the tree of life or you can take the plan of judgment he says in the breach now of course when Adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was given free moral agency it was given to him just to make a choice now Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree sets before each and every one of us amen you believe that he called it a tree of right and wrong then it was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and a tree of life he called it a tree of death and a tree of life right before us stands two trees and and and and if I could just take it in my own language if you'll just forgive me for a minute right inside of me is two trees two Natures amen one of them will bring me to death one of them will bring me to life amen and the question is which one am I going to eat off of and I say you know when when you go back and you look at the scriptures and you take it holistically at the whole thing all the way back in the beginning man had absolutely everything that they had need of there was one commandment given them and if they would have kept that one commandment there would have never been a need for another commandment ever ever there would be no need for nothing else if they would have kept that first commandment and not eaten of that tree but I tell you we've come down to a decision now we're facing two trees now right and wrong sets before us now are we going to cater to Esau or are we going to let Jacob live it's come down to you and I and it's come down to today but the same Commandment that started it all still works good today if we'll leave self alone and go after Christ we'll be fine amen if we'll not eat of the tree of self and will'll just partake of Christ and deny self will be okay I still think it's the Commandment that solves all the problems today it's still the Commandment that solves all the problems he says he says in Satan's Eden God's Great Kingdom will be taken back because Jesus fought it out with Satan In The Garden of Gethsemane and he won back Eden and we look at Jesus battling it out in Gethsemane and brother brandham said he battled it out with Satan Jesus fought it out with Satan in the Garden of Gethsemane and won back the Eden but when you go and you look at the Garden of Gethsemane and you look at uh Jesus's Agony amen you don't it's not apparent that he's fighting it out with Satan it's not apparent that Satan's there but what is apparent is that he's in agony he's in distress and he's praying and he keeps praying the same prayer God is there any way that I can bypass this word that's the question is there any way that I can bypass this word and he asked three times is there any way I can avoid this cup and every time he says the same thing at the end but not my will but thine be done how did he win Gethsemane in Gethsemane he died to his wants he died to his desires he died to everything that was the thing that Eve was not able to do she was not able to die to all of those desires she saw the tree was good for food she could have died to it right she saw that it was pleasant to the eyes she could have rejected it she saw that it was good all of those things had to do with self all three of those Temptations had to do with her good for food for her Pleasant to her eyes good to make her wise amen she could have died to self if she would have died to self she would have never been tempted and here's Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane and brother benam says he's in agony amen he begin to be troubled in his spirit all the way back at the supper when they were at supper then he's in great Agony in the garden brother B says why he said he didn't want to leave his disciples whom he loved and he didn't want to go through the pain of the Cross he knows what's coming and he doesn't want the separation that self he does doesn't want to suffer the pain that's self and Jesus now comes in the Garden of Gethsemane and he's asking Lord is there any possible way I can bypass this part of the word he says no but not my will but thine be done he goes and checks on his disciples he comes back a second time father is there any way this cup can pass me by but not my will but thine be done the third time time he he had to surrender all we're going to have to get there friends somehow someway this word is going to have to give us strength and it's going to have to expose the devil in every tactic until we finally get to that place until we say God is there any way I could buy bypass this word not my will but thine be done not I can find a loophole a justification Twisted scripture no just flat coming down to fathers there's any way I can avoid this word not my will but thine be done all the way back in the beginning the devil got victory over the word of God when he got one of his subjects brother B said the weaker one to let down the bar on the word and that's how he's won the victory every time is when he gets one of his subjects to let down the bar on one word why did they let down the bar on the word self you see why I say we're going to have to die to self I don't know if you're like me you probably thought when you come to the message you died to self I'll raise my hand I got rid of my cable TV and threw all my shorts away and I died to myself and that was part of a death there was part of dying to self I'd lived all my life that way I thought it was right I had to acknowledge it was wrong I had to die to myself but oh if I only realized how much more self there was to die to there was a heaping mound of self and I thought I had just died to all of myself and there's this monstrous blob of self behind me haunting me but God keeps creating more opportunities and more opportunities for us to die to ourselves more opportunities and I think sometimes the greatest thing God can ever do for us is make us come face to face with our self and die to what we see to surrender we know the greatest battle ever fought they had to find a mutual meeting ground and that Mutual meeting ground was in the mind of man that's where you got to meet your enemy and that's where you have to defeat your enemy in First Peter let's go to First Peter chapter 4 1 Peter chapter 4 verse one for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that has suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer shall live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God this is a great scripture Jesus suffered in the flesh but he overcame he that ha suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God that's how we're supposed to live we're supposed to suffer in this flesh what do you mean suffer in this flesh fight with it hate it resist it subdue it to the word suffer in this flesh so that we no longer should live the rest of the time in the flesh and to the lust of men but to the will of God so the rest of the time that I live in this flesh I don't want to live it to the lust of men but I want to live it to the will of God go over to First John we read this scripture last time but I want to remind you of it first John chapter 2 just a few pages over 1 John chapter 2 verse 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world all of that has to do with self I hope you're catching a theme amen let's go to Matthew chapter 4 Matthew 4:1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hunger and when the tempter came came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and Seth him on a pinnacle of the temple say than him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone Jesus said unto him it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou Willl Fall Down and Worship me then saith Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him behold Angels Came and ministered unto him this is Jesus's great test is Temptation in the wilderness and every Temptation had to do with self he had fasted 40 days and now he was a hungered he was hungry and so he tempted him with wanting bread he tempted him with the word to cast down his own body and that God would protect his own body and lest it be dashed to pieces and and he with stod him with the word then he was tempted Amen to be glorified before his time to have all the kingdoms of the world of the pride of life he was tempted with that and he overcame by the word but every one of jesus' Temptations had to do with self and he overcame the desire to fulfill self or to prove self or to feed self I think it's marvelous friends the example that's been given to us because we get tempted the same way most of our failures is has something to do with is self we're guarding oursel we're protecting ourself we're exalting oursel we have a problem with pride or we have a need to protect self and in order to protect self we leave the word in order to feed self we leave the word in order to promote self we leave the word yes and the problem itself and the Devil comes with such a slick Temptation he uses the word to try to get Jesus to serve himself but oh praise God Jesus comes right around and use is the word to defeat the Devil amen we go then we go to the Garden of Gethsemane it's the same thing it's all about him denying himself and we find that Jesus he lived the life for others he didn't live for himself he lived a life and surrendered to the will of father he was the example for us we're coming in his footsteps we're following after him his bride must have his same characteristics she must live the way he lived she's coming to a perfection where this bride will be so much like him she will be him and I think we need to follow in the footsteps of Christ and we need to follow his example and we need to lose self you know what when he when he went before Pilate pilate tries to get Jesus to defend himself and he won't defend himself he tries to get him to save his own life and he says know you not that I have power and Jesus isn't even trying to save his own life because he knows the will of the father he knows his hands are in his his life is in God's hands and he wants nothing else but the will of God he wants nothing else if God determines that I die today I want nothing else but the will of God oh I don't I don't I can't say that I'm there friends but I want to be there I want to get to the place where if that's what God wants that's what I want if that's what God says best and that's what the word says that's all I want I'll never be able to make the flesh like it the flesh may never have a full agreement with it but I'm not here to make the flesh feel good I am here to subdue this flesh and bring it subject to the word of God I'm not waiting for my flesh to like the word I'm not waiting for my flesh to like God's decisions in order for me to go with that sometimes you you march forward and you kill the Flesh and you let it be dead because it's never going to want the word of God that's right amen it's always going to want to save itself says some people tries to introduce Christianity that you're free from worry you're free from tension oh no you add tension when you become a Christian because you was kind of Go Happy gol lucky whatever was out there not caring what you did but when you become a real Christian every moment you're wondering am I pleasing the Lord if I could hear from him it puts you on tension puts you on guard that's what makes what you are listen before you before we were Christians before we were real genuine Christians I didn't care what people thought I did what I wanted to do I said what I felt like saying when I felt like saying it you guys probably wouldn't have liked me if somebody irritated me I told them exactly what I thought if they didn't like it that's their problem not my problem why because I only lived for self I didn't care as long as I defended myself and as long as I defended my reputation as long as I didn't let them talk bad about me and as long as I put them in their place and as long as nobody tread on me and nobody took from me and nobody disrespected me but when you become a Christian now everything's changed I can't just say whatever I want to say I can't just set things right I can't just defend myself why because I care what he thinks amen what he wants from me is more important than self then it puts you under tension wanting to know that you're pleasing the Lord all the time because you've moved from pleasing self to pleasing the Lord we start off pleasing self all the time but now our desire is to please him and it puts us under tension brother B made this statement in Rising of the Sun and thought it was interesting it's just a little something he injects but it says a lot to me say there they want to believe Lord he's praying the people want to believe oh surely that seed is not dead Lord how could they raise their hand like that there is something oh God something's hindering it's something he said it's old self it's that wife of job standing there saying oh that's all he says then he goes but oh Lord let that job that believer walk in this morning die completely and be buried here in the baptism of waters what is it they they surely they want to believe Lord they've raised their hands what's the resistance it's old self it's the wife of Job saying how can you give any more than that you why don't you just Curse God and die what more can you give but no let us come like job and say you be quiet flesh you be quiet and hold your peace you speak like a fool the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord the death to self amen he says in identifi with Christ in 59 he says but I challenge you tonight identify yourself with Jesus Christ and his death and his resurrection and see where you'll be at the resurrection for if we suffer with him we shall reign with him God has given us the promise and my whole desire is to be like him take me oh Lord and mold me and make me and shakee me over again like the prophet that went down in The Potter's House break me up and remold me how many of you want to pray that this morning let's go to First Corinthians I just want to read three more scriptures as we close let's go to 1 Corinthians 9 how many of you believe Paul the Apostle had the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is good so we're going to read what he wrote Because we know now that it comply to us he says in uh chapter 9 1 Corinthians chapter 9: 24 know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receive the price so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertain so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away Paul wasn't saying I've got the spirit the spirit takes care of it all Paul was realizing he still had free moral agency yes and he was keeping under his body and he was bringing it subject lest he be a cast away he was never giving his responsibility over to somebody else and blaming God every time he did something wrong CU God didn't stop him God you could have stop me God why didn't you stop me guy God why did you let this happen I've prayed those prayers but you know what you're saying you're blaming God for your own sinful Choice you're blaming God for giving into the Flesh and giving into fleshly desires you're saying God why did you let this happen God why didn't you stop this and the truth is God can stop amen God can interject God can change the scene he but but he put us on free moral agency and he's not going to take take that away because sometimes we need to know how low down we really are sometimes we need to realize what Esau is really like he acts religious he'll sing and he'll smile and he'll say nice things but what is he really he's really a despiser of the birthright because he wants himself more than he wants the birthright we've prayed those prayers I've prayed those prayers why God why didn't you stop me why did you let this happen why didn't you God could easily turn around and say why didn't you obey me why didn't you deny yourself why didn't you surrender did I not give you the example did I not preach it through the prophet did I not give you the scriptures did I not show you all through the Bible amen I don't want to keep accusing God in my own failure there's one I want to accuse and it's this flesh body I live in that's the culprit and I want that to some come subject to the word let's go to Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 verse 13 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus I want to press friends turn to one more place in Matthew 16 Matthew 16:24 then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny him himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it Esau tried to save his life he lost the birthright he lost his chance at eternal life I would rather lose my natural life and keep my real life how many of you want to rule in r with him for a thousand years well you got a difficult task ahead of you because if you're going to qualify for that and have the character and have the understanding and have the discernment to rule and Reign for a thousand years you're going to have to start practicing on this clump of dirt right now and boy I'm telling you Esau is slippery sometimes he's religious sometimes he's a good boy but he doesn't love that word and he's got to be brought subject to the word sometimes I think it's detrimental to have a good disposition the more you think about it when you really start to think about it you've seen different people different ones grow up and just naturally they just naturally are compliant they just naturally follow the rules and they're Pleasant and they're nice and they smile everybody likes them and then once in a while you have this child that's born and they're just opposite everything from birth not compliant they're willful they're determined and I think when it comes time for conversion I think the second one has a better chance than the first one think maybe it was a blessing that you can live all your life bumping your head falling down and realizing that this guy is not my friend rather than growing up and thinking this guy's my friend he he goes along with the word he's pretty good that's deception it's better to realize this is my enemy I don't like him he doesn't like me he's trying to stop me from from he's trying to stop Jacob from winning the race but for forget it flesh you're not going to win I'm predestinated to win I'm predestinated to be an overcomer in this age and I'm going to overcome my own flesh my own wrong mind I'm going to overcome it all and bring it subject to the word and may God have Grace on me and help me and give me his word and give me strength and give me power and may I use all the power he's given me to surrender and lay myself flat and give myself to him again and again and again I don't want to show up on the day of rewards and him say yeah you did okay but you just couldn't get that lump of Flesh no God help me help me to sedo this Philistine land for your kingdom amen help me to bring it help me to conquer it and help me to make it part of your purpose praise God let's all stand together we've got a task to do we've got work to do musicians if you can come and brother John if you can make your way up I have found for myself a lifetime worth of work in getting this flesh subdued to the word it's going to take more than my willpower it's going to take the spirit of God it's going to take the word of God but I believe we're in the generation that God is going to have a people I believe it amen do you believe it do you believe what the prophet said Do you believe what the word said I believe we live in the generation that there's going to be a people surrendered completely to Christ the word and that he is going to have the preeminence in a body of Believers I believe that and I believe that this old nature is going to serve the new birth and display Christ and manifest the word and stop manifesting its own willfulness and its own pride and its own I believe it I believe I live in the day I believe the anointings here I believe the word's been given what's he looking he's looking for us to take the word and Rule with a rod of of iron oh sometimes I think we rule everybody else with a rod of iron I've ruled everybody else with a rod of iron and I used the wet noodle on myself I get away with everything because because it's hard for me and I just have the hard time in my family and but if I'm going to use a rod of iron I want to use it on this back right here and say you stop that right now you stop your whining stop your complaining we're going to match the word amen we're going to do what God said because that's what that's what we want praise God forever going to rule with a rod of iron let's start right now let's climb up in his throne where he's at and Rule and reign with him now and preparation to rule and reign with him there oh I thank God I thank God he's given us a difficult task cuz if not boy we would really miss a lot but he's given us a difficult task has to instill in us the character we need to move to the next life and he's given me I don't know about you you may have it pretty easy but I've got a difficult task friends and I thank God for it because he's trying to work something out of me he's trying to draw a life and he's going to have it I believe he's going to have it may God help us let's bow our heads together and pray Lord Jesus we just want to surrender to you Lord God when we watch Lord the failures of your people God we watched the failures in the garden it was self we watched the failure of Moses at the rock it was exalting himself he let his anger because he was frustrated because people were complaining that was self the failure of David when he took baseba that was self the failure of Peter when he rejected you he was protecting self Lord we can see the failures all the way down through of your children it was old filthy self God we don't want to fall in the same pattern God we saw the victories Lord the victory that you won in your Wilderness Temptation you overcame the temptation of self and you you won the victory we saw you win in Gethsemane when you surrendered yourself to the word Lord when you didn't want to leave your disciples when you didn't want to suffer that kind of pain but Lord you were willing to surrender your will to the fathers you left us an example God God I don't want to follow after the pattern of failure because of self but God my desire is with your help you will help me to surrender myself to die to myself to become more like you God I pray that you'd give me the strength the power the wisdom the understanding to subdue this old Esau this firstborn may this firstborn according to the prophecy come subject to the New Birth God I ask for your help God I'm more determined than ever Lord to be faithful with your help with the word that you've given us in this age we can overcome we can overcome the Leo Dean condition in our flesh we can overcome the self-deception we can overcome because you've given us a word to overcome by God I pray you strengthen each one of us Lord help us to go from here Lord not losing the battle but winning the battle not being defeated by Esau not being being defeated by the sticky cerer nature but may we go forward and take the sword of the word Lord and Conquer and win and defeat and Conquer this territory For Your Glory may this patch of Earth become yours Lord may it become align to you may it become subject to you may it come and work worship and glorify you may it identify that you are the king and ruler over this patch of Earth help me Lord to rule and reign with you now help me to be an overcomer Lord we love you we ask that you would help us to take these things deeply into our hearts or that we wouldn't just move forward as everything is just the same but we would have a recognition of how deep How deep the wound of the Fall was how close the deception is and how much we need your word and we need your discernment by the spirit to discern our motive and our objective help us father I pray we give ourselves to you I pray you bless us as we go from here bless us as we live the life may we Shine the Light wherever we go May there be an attraction in our lives that would attract any of your seed that's out there Lord may they come in because this flesh must shine your light we love you God we ask your blessing in Jesus Christ's name amen I want what you want for me dear Lord whatever wherever it may be cuz I know that you know what's best my Lord I want what you want for me I want
