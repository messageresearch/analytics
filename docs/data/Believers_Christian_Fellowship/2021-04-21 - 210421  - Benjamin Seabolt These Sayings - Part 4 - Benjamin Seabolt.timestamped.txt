[4:40] right
[4:48] i'll be
[5:02] for you
[5:08] oh lord pre-paid
[5:12] me to be a saint to

[5:22] where
[5:28] [Music]
[5:36] with
[5:40] [Music]
[5:48] thank you
[6:00] praise the lord let's just pray together
[6:03] precious lord jesus we just want to
[6:06] pause here a moment to thank you once
[6:08] again for this opportunity
[6:10] that you've given us lord what a
[6:13] privileged people we are
[6:15] father to be able to come and to
[6:17] assemble ourselves together
[6:20] and not just a social event or
[6:24] for fellowship lord but to come and to
[6:26] worship the one
[6:27] and true living god lord and to
[6:30] recognize
[6:31] what form that that god has chose to
[6:33] come in in our age
[6:35] that we could worship you the way that
[6:38] you desire to be worshiped lord and we
[6:40] could
[6:41] recognize you for who you are the
[6:44] revealed word
[6:45] of our hour lord i pray that we would
[6:48] just come
[6:49] and submit both speaker and hearer to
[6:52] you at this point
[6:53] lord for we know that the task at hand
[6:56] is not something a mortal man
[6:58] is capable of doing but only the lamb
[7:01] can come and to break the book lord and
[7:03] to
[7:03] feed his sheep father so we would just
[7:06] yield ourself to you
[7:07] that you would come that you would have
[7:09] the preeminence and
[7:11] you would do that which only you can do
[7:14] we surrender ourselves to you now for
[7:17] you to have the glory in jesus christ's
[7:19] name we pray
[7:20] the bride says amen god bless you
[7:25] if you have your bibles we'll go
[7:26] straight to the word
[7:28] the book of john chapter 10
[7:32] and i'd like to pick up and lord willing
[7:35] finish on this topic of these sayings i
[7:40] believe we can
[7:42] wrap that up this evening
[7:45] if it be the will of the lord we're
[7:47] going to go to chapter 10 and verse 24.
[7:54] john chapter 10 verse 24
[7:59] says then came the jews round about him
[8:02] and said unto him
[8:04] how long dost thou make us to doubt
[8:07] if thou be the christ tell us plainly
[8:11] jesus answered them i told you and ye
[8:14] believed not
[8:16] the works that i do in my father's name
[8:18] they bear witness of me
[8:21] but ye believe not because ye are not of
[8:23] my
[8:24] sheep as i said unto you my
[8:27] sheep hear my voice and i know them
[8:30] and they follow me and i give unto them
[8:33] eternal life and they shall never perish
[8:36] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[8:38] my hand
[8:40] my father which gave them me is greater
[8:42] than all
[8:43] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[8:45] my father's hand
[8:47] i and my father are one
[8:50] then the jews took up stones again to
[8:54] stone him
[8:55] god bless you as you would have your
[8:57] seats
[9:00] i'm just going to do a very quick review
[9:03] as we would
[9:04] move forward and i want to read this
[9:07] quote again
[9:08] obviously very familiar but just in case
[9:10] somebody is here that
[9:12] doesn't know where we're coming from
[9:14] then they can have a little bit of a
[9:16] foundation
[9:17] and the seed is not here with the shock
[9:19] brother branham says luther had
[9:21] justification
[9:22] wesley had sanctification pentecostals
[9:26] had
[9:27] the restoration of the gifts but then
[9:30] i'm sorry but when the word come
[9:34] now they could produce that
[9:36] justification will save a man
[9:38] sure it was a carrier of the word just
[9:41] the same as i believe the stalk
[9:43] is part of the wheat sure it is
[9:46] but it's the carrier it ain't the life
[9:50] then along came sanctification how many
[9:53] believes in sanctification
[9:55] you believe the bible you have to so
[9:57] still that's not it
[9:59] but then came the pentecost the
[10:02] restoration of the gifts
[10:04] speaking in tongues there they called
[10:07] that the initial evidence
[10:08] which brought forth the what the shock
[10:13] but they denominated but when you
[10:16] come to say i and my father are one
[10:20] and these other things then the shuck
[10:24] pulls away from it but the real
[10:27] genuine bride church will bring forth
[10:29] the entire word of god
[10:32] in its fullness and in its strength for
[10:35] he's the same yesterday
[10:36] today and forever so brother branham
[10:40] just in this small paragraph and in this
[10:42] small quote
[10:43] lays so many definitions and
[10:46] so many um
[10:50] generational dispensations
[10:54] here just in this one quote
[10:57] defining what luther was defining what
[11:00] wesley was
[11:01] defining what the pentecostal movement
[11:04] was
[11:05] and defining that movement as the shuck
[11:07] that the seed would then come out of
[11:10] and identifying the seed as the true
[11:13] word all of the word and that included
[11:17] a people that would have a faith and an
[11:20] understanding and a belief and a
[11:22] revelation to the point that they could
[11:24] unashamedly declare
[11:26] i and my father are one
[11:30] and this has to come with a proper
[11:32] revelation and i
[11:33] i so appreciated well i've appreciated
[11:35] all the messages that our pastor has
[11:37] brought here
[11:38] but just recently he's he he touched on
[11:41] this
[11:42] we have to make sure that our revelation
[11:45] of our manifestation does not overlap a
[11:49] manifestation of another
[11:50] so if we're bribed we need to be bribed
[11:53] we don't need to be the manifestation of
[11:55] another
[11:56] and brother branham says this he says
[11:59] when i teach the oneness of god he says
[12:02] i do not believe that god is one like
[12:04] your finger as one
[12:08] so here is jesus standing there saying i
[12:11] and my father are one but brother
[12:14] branham would say
[12:15] that he's not teaching a oneness of god
[12:18] that
[12:19] one as your finger is one so
[12:22] jesus could say when you've seen me
[12:24] you've seen the father
[12:26] but it's still not the same as your
[12:29] finger
[12:30] one being one and what he's saying is
[12:33] i and my father are one i and my
[12:36] father are the same spirit
[12:39] and when you've seen me you have
[12:42] seen the father you have seen the spirit
[12:45] of the father remember the father is the
[12:47] spirit form
[12:48] and that's what he's saying he's not
[12:50] remember brother branham says
[12:52] jesus could not be his own father
[12:56] so only revelation
[12:59] is going to give us the proper
[13:01] understanding and the proper positioning
[13:03] of that
[13:04] because if it's not by revelation you're
[13:06] not going to be
[13:08] you're not going to be firm enough but
[13:11] without revelation you're going to be
[13:13] too firm
[13:14] jesus could have not been firm enough
[13:16] and he could have said well
[13:18] maybe i'm a child of god
[13:22] maybe i'm the son or he could have been
[13:26] too firm
[13:26] and he could have said i i am my own
[13:29] father
[13:31] see there has to be and brother brandon
[13:33] says he clearly a son
[13:35] clearly can't be their own father that's
[13:37] the very definition of a son
[13:38] as something that comes out of the
[13:40] father
[13:42] so it has to come by revelation it
[13:45] has to come by the the spirit of
[13:47] revelation
[13:48] for us to be the proper manifestation
[13:52] of the bride to have the proper
[13:55] declaration that i
[13:56] and the father are one but i'm not the
[14:00] father i
[14:02] and the sun are one but i'm not the sun
[14:05] and he taught very clearly on that so i
[14:07] don't need to rehash that but i just
[14:09] really appreciated that
[14:10] because that matches what brother random
[14:12] was trying to tell us through the
[14:13] message
[14:15] on the on the godhead and on the oneness
[14:17] of god he said it is
[14:19] not one like your finger this
[14:22] finger can only have one manifestation
[14:25] but this finger is part of my hand that
[14:27] can have five manifestations
[14:31] and now there's another hand and it has
[14:34] five more manifestations
[14:36] but all five all ten of those are a
[14:39] manifestation of this one body
[14:42] if that makes sense so we
[14:45] have to stay within that position we
[14:47] have to stay within that understanding
[14:50] in order to manifest properly
[14:53] what we are to manifest so we want to
[14:56] manifest i and my
[14:58] father are one but we don't want to get
[15:00] to the point
[15:02] that we're trying to be our own father
[15:03] we're trying to be our own god
[15:07] let's look at a couple of these scenes
[15:09] right before we would move forward
[15:12] that we've already touched on
[15:17] we've learned that it's the father's
[15:18] business to destroy denominational
[15:21] thinking
[15:22] by explaining the scriptures with their
[15:24] true spiritual meaning
[15:26] and to fulfill the scriptures that is
[15:30] written
[15:31] of yourself and this goes right along
[15:33] with what i was just saying we don't
[15:35] want to be trying to fulfill a scripture
[15:37] that was written for somebody else or
[15:40] that was written for another
[15:41] manifestation or another dispensation
[15:44] so we want to have a true spiritual
[15:47] revelation of the scriptures that
[15:49] pertain to us
[15:51] and not back down on those
[15:54] not back down on those one iota but not
[15:57] overstep that either
[15:59] for the proper manifestation the true
[16:02] believer has the power to remit sin
[16:05] the sin of unbelief by presenting the
[16:07] living word for the day
[16:08] the same as jesus and any other true
[16:12] believer
[16:13] of the ages that have been passed we've
[16:17] learned that all
[16:17] hell is against the revelation of christ
[16:21] to the individual
[16:25] we've learned that the spirit of truth
[16:26] says jesus christ
[16:28] is come in the flesh not just he was
[16:32] or that he will be we've learned that
[16:36] the true bride doctrine
[16:38] is the spiritual bride is the word made
[16:41] flesh and blood again
[16:46] we've learned that her teaching is not
[16:48] wilt thou be reformed
[16:50] but rather wilt thou be made whole
[16:57] the believer does nothing but what the
[17:00] father shows them
[17:02] whosoever hears the words of the
[17:04] believer and believeth on him that sent
[17:06] him
[17:08] can pass from death unto life
[17:12] the believer contest can say
[17:15] search the scriptures for they testify
[17:18] of me
[17:20] he can also he can also say i am come
[17:23] in my father's name
[17:27] we've learned that the work of god is to
[17:29] believe
[17:30] on him whom he hath sent
[17:34] that should give anybody with a
[17:37] legalistic spirit following them around
[17:39] so much liberty not
[17:42] by works of this carnal flesh
[17:45] but the work of god as defined by the
[17:48] scripture
[17:49] by jesus himself is to
[17:52] simply believe on him that is sent of
[17:55] god
[17:56] and if you believe on him that is sent
[17:58] of god no doubt you're going to have
[18:00] works
[18:05] i am the bread of life
[18:10] i am the light of the world
[18:14] i have come down from heaven
[18:17] where i was taught of my father and i
[18:19] will return there
[18:22] the words that the believer speaks are
[18:25] spirit
[18:26] and they are life
[18:30] and probably as we said last time the
[18:32] most important thing that we have
[18:33] learned
[18:35] is that the antichrist denominational
[18:38] spirit
[18:40] is within our own framework that we
[18:43] carry around
[18:43] each and every day the
[18:46] antichrist spirit within the framework
[18:49] of the true christian church
[18:51] is not out there it's not even right
[18:54] beside of you
[18:55] it is right with you each and every day
[18:57] and that is the shock
[19:00] that we need to be worried about that is
[19:02] the shock
[19:03] that we need to pay attention to and
[19:05] that is the shock that we want to pull
[19:07] away
[19:07] because what good does it do if they all
[19:10] pull away
[19:11] or if the person sitting beside of you
[19:12] pulls away
[19:14] if you don't pull away from your own
[19:16] shock and have your atoms change
[19:18] does no good let's turn to john
[19:21] 7 as we would move forward and i
[19:25] don't intend to be very lengthy uh there
[19:27] was just a few things that i want to
[19:30] wrap up here obviously once you start
[19:33] laying down
[19:34] several of these other things they all
[19:36] start blending together
[19:38] so you just start saying the same thing
[19:40] over and over again and that's
[19:42] not exactly what i want to do i just
[19:44] want to reveal these things for what
[19:46] they are
[19:47] and no doubt in your own studies you can
[19:49] go back and pick these things up
[19:51] and more than anything i just wanted to
[19:53] draw attention
[19:54] to the fact that these are things that
[19:56] we have been preaching
[19:58] these are things that we are setting
[20:00] under but
[20:01] these are these are things that that
[20:03] have been being said and have been
[20:05] transpiring
[20:07] and maybe we just weren't privy to it
[20:10] maybe we just didn't recognize it for
[20:12] what it was
[20:13] as i and my father are one and these
[20:16] other things
[20:17] so when we look in john chapter 7
[20:19] beginning at verse 14
[20:23] now about the midst of the feast jesus
[20:26] went up into the temple and taught
[20:28] and the jews marveled saying
[20:32] how knoweth this man letters
[20:35] have he never learned they're saying how
[20:38] does this man know the scripture
[20:40] and he was not in school with us that's
[20:42] what they're saying
[20:45] jesus answered them and said my doctor
[20:48] doctrine is not mine
[20:51] but his that sent me
[20:54] here is the key that list that i just
[20:56] read you
[20:58] of the bride being the spiritual bride
[21:00] being the word made flesh and blood
[21:03] of her having the power to remit sins
[21:06] of her being the bread of life of her
[21:08] being
[21:10] the light of the world none of that is
[21:14] true
[21:14] you can say that you can declare that
[21:16] you can even declare it forcefully and
[21:18] boldly
[21:18] but none of that is actually true unless
[21:21] you also make this statement
[21:24] my doctrine's not my own it is
[21:27] his that sent me because at the end of
[21:30] the day it makes
[21:31] no difference and it doesn't amount to
[21:34] here's a good country term for you a
[21:35] hill of beans
[21:37] what i say or what you say unless that
[21:40] doctrine is not your own
[21:43] and it's his that sent you now if it
[21:47] is his that sent you it means a lot
[21:52] and you can say that unashamedly
[21:55] and unbashfully and stand on that with
[21:58] your life
[22:00] the same as jesus did my doctrine is
[22:03] not mine but his that sent me
[22:08] if any man
[22:12] will do his will he shall know of the
[22:16] doctrine
[22:17] whether it be of god or whether i speak
[22:20] of myself
[22:22] if any man will do the will of god
[22:27] if any man will seek the will of god
[22:30] he will know whether this doctrine that
[22:33] i speak
[22:34] is mine or if it is from my father
[22:42] watch this identification that he lays
[22:44] in here
[22:45] so simple but so profound
[22:49] it is so effective i would venture to
[22:51] say you could probably recognize
[22:53] 99 of false doctrine by this next
[22:56] statement
[22:58] he that speaketh of himself seeketh his
[23:01] own glory
[23:02] but he that seeketh his glory that sent
[23:04] him the same
[23:05] is true and no unrighteousness is in him
[23:13] if a man is teaching something to draw
[23:15] you to him
[23:16] and for his own glory i'm venturing to
[23:18] say it's
[23:19] not the doctrine of the father
[23:22] it's that simple but when you see a man
[23:26] not concerned about his own glory or
[23:29] lifting himself up
[23:30] but simply pointing to the word and
[23:32] pointing to the truth and pointing to
[23:34] the father
[23:35] and trying to help the sheep
[23:38] i would be very careful i would be very
[23:42] careful to say well that's just what he
[23:43] thinks
[23:46] he that speaketh of himself seeketh his
[23:48] own glory but
[23:50] he that seeketh his glory that sent him
[23:55] the same is true and no unrighteousness
[23:58] is in him
[24:02] such discernment that can come with that
[24:04] simple statement
[24:06] such discernment did not moses give you
[24:10] the law and yet
[24:11] none of you keep with the law why
[24:14] go ye about to kill me
[24:18] the people answered and said thou hast
[24:20] the devil
[24:21] who goeth about to kill thee jesus
[24:24] answered
[24:25] answered and said unto them i have done
[24:28] one
[24:28] work and ye all marvel this is a
[24:30] conversation that took place
[24:32] right after he made the man whole and
[24:34] they're still all upset about it
[24:37] says the people answering it said thou
[24:39] hast the devil who goeth about to kill
[24:41] thee
[24:41] jesus answered and said unto them i have
[24:43] done one work and ye
[24:45] all marvel moses therefore gave unto you
[24:48] circumcision
[24:49] not because it is of moses but of the
[24:53] fathers
[24:54] and ye on the sabbath day circumcise
[24:58] a man
[25:01] if a man on the sabbath day
[25:05] receives circumcision that the law
[25:08] of moses should not be broken are ye
[25:12] angry at me because i have made a man
[25:15] every wet hole on the sabbath day
[25:20] this doesn't even make good logical
[25:22] sense and that's all jesus is telling
[25:24] them
[25:26] you all just aren't even making any
[25:28] sense you'll circumcise a man
[25:31] so that you can keep the letter of the
[25:33] law god forbid you would break the
[25:35] letter of the law
[25:36] but here i will make a man whole
[25:40] completely circumcise him
[25:43] make him whole on the sabbath day and
[25:45] you're all up in arms about it and you
[25:47] want to kill me
[25:50] the letter killeth the spirit giveth
[25:53] life
[25:55] it's the same battle from the beginning
[25:59] a letter with no revelation
[26:03] a letter with no revelation
[26:08] jesus said judge
[26:11] not according to appearance
[26:15] to the appearance but judge
[26:18] righteous judgment
[26:22] jesus is telling them don't judge this
[26:26] by inkblots on paper what you can
[26:29] reason and prove out in your carnal mind
[26:31] that this is clearly
[26:33] thou shalt thou shalt not
[26:36] he said judge not according to the
[26:39] appearance
[26:40] but judge righteous judgment
[26:43] righteous judgment will never go against
[26:46] the ink blots on paper
[26:49] but you can have the understanding
[26:51] thinking
[26:52] you have the understanding of the ink
[26:53] blots on paper and not have righteous
[26:56] judgment
[26:57] just in this case there is clearly
[27:00] a law here that nothing can be done on
[27:04] the sabbath day
[27:05] but there's an exemption to that law
[27:07] that a man can be circumcised on the
[27:08] sabbath day
[27:10] and without revelation they're wanting
[27:13] to kill
[27:13] jesus for making a man whole on the
[27:15] sabbath day
[27:16] because without revelation they cannot
[27:19] understand
[27:21] the spirit of circumcision
[27:24] they're just looking at a physical
[27:26] circumcision
[27:28] not catching the spiritual application
[27:31] so they're technically right but they're
[27:35] spiritually completely wrong
[27:37] to the point that they want to kill the
[27:39] man
[27:40] who's not even breaking the law because
[27:43] they think with their reasoning they can
[27:46] technically have him dead to rights
[27:52] judge not according to the appearance
[27:54] but
[27:55] judge righteous judgment
[27:58] then said some of them of jerusalem is
[28:02] not this he whom they seek to kill i
[28:05] find it comical that they just called
[28:06] him crazy a few
[28:07] a few verses up because he told them
[28:09] that they wanted to kill him
[28:11] but it's common knowledge the people was
[28:14] like well this is the god that they want
[28:15] to kill
[28:16] and jesus says you want to kill me
[28:17] because i've done this and they're like
[28:19] you're crazy you got a devil we never
[28:21] said that what are you talking about
[28:25] righteous judgment
[28:28] but lo he speaketh boldly and they say
[28:31] nothing unto him do the rulers know
[28:34] indeed that this is the very christ
[28:41] how be it we know this man whence he is
[28:44] but when christ cometh no man knoweth
[28:47] once he is
[28:48] then cried jesus in the temple as he
[28:50] taught saying
[28:52] ye both know me and ye know whence i am
[28:56] and i am not come of myself but he that
[28:59] sent me is true
[29:00] whom ye know not
[29:04] but i know him for i am from him
[29:08] and he hath sent me
[29:11] then they sought to take him but
[29:14] no man laid hands on him because his
[29:17] hour
[29:17] was not yet come so jesus is coming in
[29:20] and having a conversation
[29:22] he's like i've done this you want to
[29:23] kill me you're crazy we don't want to
[29:25] kill you why would we want to do
[29:26] something like that
[29:27] the common people say isn't this god
[29:29] that they want to kill
[29:31] i wonder if the rulers know that he's
[29:33] the christ and they're just not telling
[29:34] us
[29:38] but they still don't have that
[29:39] revelation
[29:41] that this is the christ and jesus comes
[29:46] and this is what they're hung up on
[29:48] they're hung up on the fact
[29:50] that they know this guy
[29:56] i know this guy he can't be the christ
[30:01] don't leave it back there saints
[30:04] i know where he come from i was his
[30:07] third grade teacher
[30:11] i know i know this guy this is not the
[30:15] christ
[30:18] jesus cried in the temple as he taught
[30:20] saying
[30:22] yes you know me you know where i've come
[30:25] from
[30:27] but do you really
[30:31] and i am not come of myself but he that
[30:34] sent me is true whom
[30:36] ye know not but i know him for i am from
[30:41] him and
[30:41] he hath sent me it's too much for them
[30:46] it's too much for them then
[30:50] they sought to take him but no man laid
[30:53] hands on him
[30:54] because his hour was not yet come
[31:01] don't get hung up on the fact that you
[31:03] know that person
[31:08] don't get hung up on the facts that you
[31:10] can and they are facts
[31:13] of their bad spots they're good spots
[31:17] they're in between spots
[31:19] they're bad days they're good days their
[31:21] background
[31:23] the trial that they're going through
[31:24] right now the trial that they just went
[31:26] through
[31:28] don't get hung up on the fact that you
[31:30] know that person and you know the
[31:31] response
[31:33] and declare yourself into a position
[31:35] that you're not in a manifestation that
[31:37] you're not
[31:38] into a seed of judgment already
[31:42] judge not that ye be not judged
[31:50] they were standing there with factual
[31:54] data they knew him
[31:57] and they knew where he come from
[32:00] and jesus never denied it you do know me
[32:03] and you know where i come from
[32:05] but then he would turn right back around
[32:06] and say you don't know who that sent me
[32:13] help help me understand you just told me
[32:15] that i know you and i know where you
[32:16] come from but
[32:18] i don't know how you got here and i
[32:19] don't know who that sent you
[32:22] let the prophet bring some clarity to
[32:23] this
[32:25] or if you have no revelation more
[32:28] confusion to that
[32:30] in 1965 communion he said if somebody
[32:33] back there would say
[32:34] william branham he was a rank rascal see
[32:37] because i was born in charles of charles
[32:39] and ella branham
[32:41] in their nature i was a sinner i came to
[32:44] the world a liar and
[32:45] all the habits of the world laid right
[32:47] in me
[32:48] but down in there
[32:51] two was another nature present see
[32:54] predestinate
[32:56] was in there by god in this same body
[32:59] see two natures in there well i only
[33:02] catered to one but down in there was a
[33:05] little speck of life
[33:07] all the time what was it there was
[33:10] another william branham
[33:12] a little spot of eternal life down in
[33:14] there from the genes of god the word of
[33:17] god that was placed in there
[33:20] each one of you can think of similar
[33:22] things see
[33:23] it was working see there was something
[33:26] moving but yet all at once i looked up
[33:30] and i
[33:31] said i'm not the son of charles and
[33:34] elebrana
[33:37] i thought he just said that they that he
[33:40] was a ranked rascal from charles and
[33:41] alibranum
[33:43] is this not the same dialogue as this
[33:46] not the same uh verbiage that jesus
[33:50] christ himself used
[33:53] we're not disputing the fact that we're
[33:55] a rank rascal
[33:57] we're not disputing that you know where
[33:59] i come from and you know who i am
[34:02] but don't get so focused on that that
[34:04] you miss me
[34:07] i'm not the son of charles and ella
[34:09] branham then
[34:10] i was born again notice what he types
[34:13] the birth the rebirth to
[34:16] the recognition that he was not just
[34:19] the son of charles and alibranum
[34:23] don't get confused about the new birth
[34:25] when you get to the point
[34:27] that you have a proper understanding
[34:29] that you are not
[34:30] just the child of your earthly parents
[34:35] you were born again because the only way
[34:37] you could have that revelation is
[34:39] directly
[34:40] from god the word has got to come to the
[34:42] word in you
[34:44] and give you that proper understanding
[34:46] brother brano says that's
[34:48] what the new birth is he said is when
[34:49] the word comes to the word
[34:53] i'm not the son of charles and ella
[34:56] branham
[34:56] then i was born again
[35:00] that little life was laying there the
[35:02] life of water was poured upon it
[35:04] then it began to grow now that old life
[35:07] was forgiven
[35:08] put in the sea of god's forgetfulness to
[35:11] never be remembered against me no more
[35:13] now we stand justified as though we
[35:16] never sinned
[35:18] in the presence of god
[35:21] that should bring some clarity to what
[35:23] jesus was trying to say
[35:24] the prophet laid it right out with the
[35:27] same verb
[35:28] verbiage same situation
[35:33] the real me the word me
[35:38] covered up by a rank rascal
[35:42] john 8 58 jesus said unto them
[35:45] verily verily i say unto you
[35:48] before abraham was i
[35:51] am
[35:57] this is
[36:00] after that he has told them
[36:04] you know where i come from you know who
[36:06] i am
[36:08] but you don't know of him that sent me
[36:11] and now he comes and says before abraham
[36:13] was i am
[36:18] john 16 28 i come forth
[36:22] from the father and i'm coming to the
[36:24] world
[36:26] again i leave the world and go to the
[36:29] father
[36:31] there is no way without spiritual
[36:34] revelation
[36:35] you can make heads or tales of what he
[36:36] is saying there is
[36:38] no way without spiritual revelation you
[36:41] could
[36:41] you could have ever recognized
[36:44] what he was trying to say and who he was
[36:47] and the same applies to each and every
[36:49] one of us
[36:50] without true spiritual revelation your
[36:54] hybrid mind and your hybrid flesh
[36:56] will not allow you to come to that
[36:58] understanding
[37:00] it will beat that revelation down the
[37:02] same the way the pharisees wanted to
[37:04] beat jesus down
[37:05] it takes a true and proper spiritual
[37:08] revelation
[37:09] from god himself to be able to declare
[37:12] those things
[37:13] and have that understanding
[37:17] you will never overcome that by
[37:19] willpower you will never overcome that
[37:21] by
[37:22] trying harder you will never overcome
[37:24] that by your mental prowess
[37:26] it is the sovereign grace of god the
[37:29] word
[37:30] coming to the word in you is the only
[37:32] thing
[37:33] that can spark and give you that
[37:34] revelation
[37:37] john 8 46 jesus speaking said
[37:40] which of you can convince me of sin
[37:44] this is another one of those other
[37:45] things
[37:48] which of you can convince me of sin and
[37:50] if i say the truth
[37:52] why do you not believe me he that is of
[37:55] god
[37:55] heareth god's words ye therefore hear
[37:58] them not
[38:00] because ye are not of god
[38:05] john 10 verse 7 then jesus said again
[38:09] verily verily i say unto you i
[38:12] am the door of the sheep
[38:17] if you weren't catching what jesus was
[38:19] saying back in chapter 7
[38:22] when he comes and starts starts laying
[38:24] these things down to them
[38:26] it's no wonder they wanted to kill him
[38:28] because with
[38:29] when they missed that revelation there
[38:32] in chapter seven
[38:33] everything that he says after that is
[38:35] blasphemy
[38:37] and that's what they wanted to kill him
[38:39] for and they would have been correct in
[38:41] doing so
[38:42] if it wasn't blasphemy just like god
[38:46] would be correct enslain each and every
[38:48] one of us
[38:49] for even thinking let alone saying
[38:53] these other things unless it was true
[38:57] and unless a vindicated prophet came and
[39:00] exposed those mysteries to us
[39:04] they would have been correct in carrying
[39:08] out their punishment on him
[39:11] but it was true
[39:14] jesus said unto her chapter 11 verse 25
[39:18] i am the resurrection
[39:21] and the life he that believeth in me
[39:25] though he were dead yet shall he live
[39:33] are you the resurrection are you the
[39:35] life
[39:38] are you a part of that resurrection do
[39:41] you have the life of god in you
[39:45] don't leave it 2000 years ago
[39:48] john 15 verse 1 jesus said
[39:51] i am the true vine and my father is the
[39:56] husbandman
[39:58] every branch in me that beareth forth
[40:01] that beareth not fruit he taketh away
[40:04] and every branch that beareth fruit
[40:07] he purgeth it that it may bring forth
[40:10] more fruit now ye are clean
[40:14] through the word which i have spoken
[40:16] unto you
[40:18] that's a big statement can you say it
[40:22] you can if your doctrine is not of your
[40:26] own
[40:27] and it's of him that sent you and you're
[40:30] not seeking your own glory
[40:32] you're seeking the glory of the father
[40:35] anything else is punishable by death
[40:40] anything short of that will only result
[40:43] in spiritual death
[40:48] verse 22 if i had not
[40:52] come and spoken unto them
[40:55] they had not sinned
[40:58] but now they have no cloak
[41:01] for their sin
[41:05] look at the position and the seriousness
[41:08] that we should take that with
[41:10] the word that has been delivered to us
[41:13] saints
[41:14] is not a light message it is not a light
[41:16] word it is
[41:17] it is not a frivolous thing
[41:21] our existence on this earth is not a
[41:24] frivolous helter skelter do what i want
[41:27] come as you go come and go whatever i
[41:29] feel like doing today
[41:32] this is the door to the sheep
[41:36] you're not the door to the sheep but
[41:37] this is the door to the sheep
[41:39] that the father will use
[41:44] in order to redeem those sheep he's got
[41:46] to get his word to them
[41:47] how else is he going to get his word to
[41:49] them
[41:51] jesus said
[41:55] if i had not come what was jesus
[41:59] the word if the word
[42:03] had not come and declared itself to them
[42:07] they would not be in sin
[42:10] if the word had not come in our day
[42:15] the baptist the methodists the
[42:18] denominational system
[42:21] would not be in sin
[42:25] but it has come and it has declared
[42:28] itself
[42:29] openly and therefore
[42:32] we now therefore they
[42:35] now have no cloak for their unbelief
[42:42] the same thing that transpired 2 000
[42:44] years ago
[42:45] is the same thing that transpired in our
[42:47] age is the
[42:48] same position that we find ourselves in
[42:54] your co-worker may not have sin
[43:01] but when the word is presented to him in
[43:05] your life and gives him a
[43:08] proper understanding between right and
[43:11] wrong
[43:12] now he has no cloak for that sin
[43:16] don't live a life
[43:19] that they that they're they're going to
[43:21] have an argument at that day
[43:26] say well i don't want them to be
[43:27] condemned
[43:29] so you don't want them to have a chance
[43:31] at life
[43:33] because you can't have one without the
[43:34] other
[43:36] that's a hard saying but jesus himself
[43:40] said it he says the word of god
[43:44] comes to do two things it the word of
[43:48] god
[43:49] comes to bring out the believer and it
[43:51] comes to condemn the unbeliever
[43:54] he told the disciples go and baptize
[43:58] him that will be saved will be baptized
[44:00] him that will not be baptized they're
[44:02] damned
[44:04] the word of god has to go forth
[44:08] it has to go forth for life to come
[44:10] forth
[44:13] if it's rejected and there's judgment
[44:16] from that
[44:17] that's not your fault it happened in
[44:20] jesus day
[44:21] it happened when the prophet was here
[44:23] it's happened since the beginning of
[44:24] time
[44:26] the only way for somebody not to be
[44:28] condemned
[44:29] is for the word not to go forth
[44:34] the only way for all of us to be
[44:36] condemned
[44:37] is for the word not to go forth nobody
[44:40] can come to life without the word
[44:43] we have to present the word we leave the
[44:46] judgment to the father
[44:50] if i had not come and spoken unto them
[44:54] they had not sinned jesus did not say i
[44:58] wish i would have never come so that
[45:00] they could have went on in their sin
[45:05] don't live a life that way saints
[45:10] don't live a life that way that they had
[45:12] that excuse at that day
[45:14] i didn't know any better you never told
[45:15] me you never showed me you never did
[45:17] anything to make me ask a question
[45:19] you never made me think you were any
[45:20] different than anybody else how was i to
[45:22] know
[45:23] how can you condemn me i didn't know any
[45:25] better
[45:29] it's solemn i know it's it's serious but
[45:32] it's true
[45:34] the position that we find ourselves in
[45:41] john 8 28 then said jesus
[45:44] unto them when ye
[45:47] have lifted up the son of man then
[45:50] shall ye know that i am he
[45:54] and that i do nothing of myself but as
[45:58] my father hath taught me i speak these
[46:01] things
[46:03] and he that sent me is with me the
[46:05] father hath not left me alone
[46:07] for i do always those things that please
[46:12] him
[46:15] when ye have lifted up the son of man
[46:20] then
[46:23] shall you know that i am he
[46:27] jesus is not speaking to his disciples
[46:29] here
[46:31] he is not speaking to the unbeliever
[46:34] i'm sorry he is not speaking to the
[46:35] believer
[46:38] because the believer has the capability
[46:42] to recognize him for who he is prior to
[46:44] him being lifted up
[46:46] him being lifted up was him being lifted
[46:48] up and crucified
[46:49] and he's telling them the unbeliever
[46:53] when the son of man is lifted up then
[46:56] you're going to know
[47:02] then then ye shall know that i am he
[47:08] and that i do nothing of myself but as
[47:10] my father hath taught me i speak these
[47:12] things
[47:13] what did the roman soldier say after the
[47:16] crucifixion
[47:19] surely this was the son of god
[47:29] we want to look at this pattern here
[47:34] in the masterpiece
[47:38] brother branham says don't let
[47:41] anybody wait too long lord
[47:45] he's praying he says don't let anybody
[47:47] wait too long lord
[47:49] looks awful close the harvest is truly
[47:53] ripe
[47:54] the great combine of god will sw sweep
[47:57] through the land one of these days
[48:00] straws will fly every way
[48:04] but the weak shall be gathered to the
[48:06] garner
[48:07] taken up for it is
[48:10] life now
[48:13] as i read these next few quotes i want
[48:16] you to hold john 8 28 in your mind
[48:19] because this is the exact same thing
[48:23] i'm going to read it again then jesus
[48:26] said unto them
[48:27] when ye have lifted up the son of man
[48:30] then shall ye know that i am he and that
[48:33] i do
[48:33] nothing of myself but as my father hath
[48:36] taught me
[48:37] i speak these things
[48:41] we're going to focus and look at this
[48:44] great
[48:44] combine of god
[48:49] and i think you're probably going to
[48:50] have a different viewpoint of it when i
[48:52] get to the end of it
[48:55] how many want to go in the great combine
[48:58] of god
[49:03] i'll find out when i get when i get done
[49:05] reading
[49:08] how many have heard the prophet say i
[49:10] can hear the coming of the combine
[49:12] i can hear the coming of the combine
[49:14] like over and over he says this
[49:16] i can hear the coming of the combine he
[49:18] says it 11 times
[49:19] i can hear the coming of the combine but
[49:21] six of those times
[49:23] he gives us definitions of the process
[49:26] of the combine the identified
[49:29] masterpiece
[49:30] of god let me back up to this one that i
[49:31] just read in the masterpiece
[49:33] so this he says the great combine of god
[49:38] will sweep through the land one of these
[49:39] days
[49:41] now look at the process that he lays to
[49:43] the combine
[49:45] straws will fly every way the wheat will
[49:48] be gathered to the garner
[50:00] the identified masterpiece of god
[50:04] now lord when we see the shock now
[50:06] pulling away from the grain
[50:08] going worldly the shock has to pull
[50:12] away so that the grain can get in the
[50:14] presence of the sun
[50:16] i hear the coming of the combine lord it
[50:20] won't be long
[50:21] and then the great elevator will take up
[50:24] his bride
[50:25] into the glory in the presence of god
[50:30] he hears the coming of the combine
[50:33] the shock is pulling away from the grain
[50:35] and it has to pull away so that the
[50:38] grain can be in the presence of the sun
[50:41] it won't be long and then the great
[50:45] elevator will take his bride up into
[50:48] glory
[50:49] into the presence of god the
[50:52] elevator is part of the combine for
[50:54] those that aren't privy
[50:56] to that knowledge the elevator is a
[51:00] part of the combine that expels the
[51:03] grain
[51:04] into the garner into the truck into the
[51:07] safe place
[51:11] 1964 the harvest time but thank god
[51:15] the grain is going on then if that
[51:18] is true by the word this is in the
[51:21] message harvest time so brother branham
[51:23] just went through the whole
[51:24] teaching on typing the true word of god
[51:28] with the wheat plant and he's saying
[51:31] if it's true if this teaching if it's
[51:33] true by the word
[51:36] to where we're living and it's true by
[51:39] nature
[51:40] it's vindicated the corn of wheat
[51:44] every way how much longer do we have
[51:49] you know what i hear the coming
[51:53] of the combine the world
[51:56] council will separate it
[52:02] how many wants to go in the combine now
[52:07] i hear the coming of the combine
[52:10] the world council she'll
[52:13] separate it she'll separate what she'll
[52:16] separate the shuck from the wheat
[52:18] she'll separate the stalk from the grain
[52:25] 1965 the seed is not air with the shuck
[52:28] set here tonight and see what eagles
[52:31] really can eat
[52:32] the word and have a living christ
[52:35] living among them showing himself alive
[52:37] the same yesterday today and forever
[52:40] they don't want to be heirs with the
[52:42] shock they're to be burned
[52:45] all the straws and things is to be
[52:47] burned the
[52:48] combine is coming to beat the weed out
[52:54] you want to be weak
[52:59] how many wants to go into the combine to
[53:02] get
[53:03] beat
[53:06] 1965 the rapture we're right
[53:10] there ready now the only thing the
[53:14] church is coming out
[53:16] has got to lay before the sun to ripen
[53:19] the great combine will come by after a
[53:21] while
[53:22] remember we know what the combine is now
[53:25] it will come by after a while the stalks
[53:27] will be burned
[53:30] but the grain will be gathered into the
[53:32] garner
[53:35] look at the process that he's now
[53:37] putting into this if you want to call it
[53:39] a
[53:39] parable or this type
[53:42] look at the definitions and the process
[53:45] and the verbiage
[53:46] that he's laying in there 1965
[53:50] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[53:53] the grain is here
[53:55] it'll be gathered into the garner it was
[53:59] the bride
[53:59] that part of it but what did he say
[54:02] would happen to the stalk
[54:03] it'll be burned with unquestionable fire
[54:07] seek salvation now while you can
[54:10] be a grain not a stalk go
[54:13] into the life not the old dead form
[54:17] go into the life of christ
[54:20] the word made manifest and
[54:24] vindicated so this is the gathering time
[54:28] the combine is coming
[54:32] you'd better get into the grain because
[54:34] the shucks going to be left behind
[54:38] i found this extremely interesting
[54:42] because my view of the combine changed
[54:45] drastically when i read this
[54:49] the combine is the world council of
[54:52] churches that's going to beat
[54:55] the wheat away from the stalk
[54:59] that is not going to be a pleasant
[55:01] process
[55:04] but you want to know what the end result
[55:06] of that is
[55:08] it's the same thing that jesus said
[55:12] when ye have lifted up the son of man
[55:16] are we not in a son of man ministry
[55:20] then shall ye know that i
[55:23] am she
[55:27] that i am he and that i do nothing of
[55:30] myself now remember don't try to put
[55:32] yourself in one part of this phrase if
[55:34] you can't put yourself in all of it
[55:37] don't try to say that you are she if you
[55:39] cannot also say that i do nothing of
[55:41] myself
[55:44] but as my father hath taught me
[55:48] i speak these things so if you're
[55:50] teaching something other than what the
[55:52] father says don't try to put yourself in
[55:54] there
[55:55] but if you can align yourself and yield
[55:58] yourself and surrender yourself to
[56:00] all three of those things don't back up
[56:03] on it
[56:04] because that is the end of the process
[56:08] that the unbeliever is going to see that
[56:10] the foolish virgin
[56:12] and the lost are going to see when the
[56:15] son of man
[56:16] is lifted up the result
[56:20] is that the foolish virgin
[56:23] and the lost brother branham called him
[56:25] cannon fodder
[56:29] they will know as he said in christ is
[56:32] the mystery of god revealed he will take
[56:34] her
[56:35] he will set her up here and away he'll
[56:37] go with her
[56:39] she will go into that combine she will
[56:42] be beaten
[56:43] but she's going to go in an elevator
[56:46] and then we're done then we're done
[56:52] you see that sounds pretty dreary it's
[56:54] not a real good
[56:57] roses and flowery bed of each sermon
[57:01] no but it's real and it's what's coming
[57:06] here's the key it says the combine is
[57:10] going down through the field if it runs
[57:12] into a husk
[57:13] that is real real tight real real
[57:17] tight against a piece of an ear of corn
[57:20] that still has moisture in it that
[57:22] moisture will hold it together
[57:26] it's going to be a real rough process
[57:28] when it goes in that combine
[57:32] it's going to be a rough process anyhow
[57:34] but it's going to be
[57:36] real rough on that one that's why
[57:38] brother branham says i
[57:40] hear the coming of the combine
[57:43] the grain has got to pull away from the
[57:45] shuck
[57:46] lay in the these aren't just cliches
[57:49] saints
[57:50] it's not just message talk and write a
[57:52] song about it and
[57:54] whatever else this is real he's telling
[57:56] us these things to catch it
[58:00] it's not just a cliche lay in the
[58:02] presence of the sun
[58:03] what's he trying to tell us there's a
[58:06] combine coming
[58:08] that's going to strip the shuck off of
[58:10] the seed
[58:12] and what you can do to help yourself out
[58:14] right here and now
[58:15] is get rid of all the shuck on you that
[58:17] you can
[58:19] separate yourself from your hybrid
[58:22] spirit
[58:22] and your carnal desires as much as you
[58:24] can right now
[58:26] so that when that combine does come
[58:29] it's a lot easier process it's not going
[58:33] to be easy
[58:34] any way that you take it but what you
[58:37] don't want to be doing is having that
[58:39] combine rip step
[58:40] up stuff off of you that you could have
[58:42] laid down years ago
[58:44] it will if you need it to it's going to
[58:48] accomplish the purpose if you need it to
[58:51] but that's not the spirit that should be
[58:53] in the bride
[58:54] that is not the nature that we should be
[58:56] operating under
[58:58] brother branham says you say you'll wait
[59:01] until that time comes
[59:03] he says it will be too late then because
[59:05] you've already taken the spirit of it
[59:08] what is the spirit of it the spirit of
[59:10] his rebellion
[59:12] the spirit of it is not yielding the
[59:14] spirit of it
[59:15] is not giving him the preeminence
[59:22] but if your seed it'll take that off of
[59:25] you
[59:27] but why not lay it down now that we have
[59:29] a chance
[59:31] god has been so gracious to us and
[59:34] revealed himself to us so much
[59:36] to give us an opportunity to come
[59:40] willingly to come if we want to say
[59:44] easier not easily we know we're fighting
[59:46] hybrid flesh and a hybrid mind it's not
[59:48] easy it's a it's a
[59:50] it's a daily struggle it's a daily
[59:52] beating
[59:54] but why not you know what i would rather
[59:57] beat myself up than have somebody else
[59:58] beat me up
[1:00:01] i would rather hit myself in the stomach
[1:00:04] than have somebody else hit me in the
[1:00:05] stomach
[1:00:07] if there's a beating that's got to be
[1:00:09] given
[1:00:10] i would rather beat myself than have
[1:00:12] somebody beat me
[1:00:14] if there's things that need stripped off
[1:00:16] of me
[1:00:18] i would rather lay in the presence of
[1:00:20] the sun now
[1:00:22] and have that shuck dry
[1:00:26] up and peel back easily then i would
[1:00:29] have that shuck hanging on real tight
[1:00:31] and getting
[1:00:31] ripped off when i go through the combine
[1:00:36] if your seed you're going to end up in
[1:00:40] that elevator
[1:00:41] period that's not the question that's
[1:00:44] not what i'm preaching
[1:00:45] i'm not preaching if you don't do this
[1:00:46] you're going to be lost you're coming
[1:00:51] you're coming and i'm going to be there
[1:00:57] but i would much rather go through that
[1:00:58] smoothly than i would be screaming for
[1:01:01] dear life
[1:01:04] he's given us that opportunity he has
[1:01:06] given us insight of this process
[1:01:09] he's came and he's given definitions of
[1:01:12] what these things are and what these
[1:01:13] things are that's coming
[1:01:17] the same way that jesus told the
[1:01:18] disciples i've told you these things
[1:01:22] so that when they transpire you'll know
[1:01:26] what they are
[1:01:28] what we don't want to happen saints
[1:01:31] is the combine come which we now know is
[1:01:34] the world council of churches
[1:01:36] you say oh that's just a thing you know
[1:01:39] people
[1:01:40] saints it's real and it's working and
[1:01:42] you're going to be shocked how quickly
[1:01:44] it takes power
[1:01:47] and what you don't want to do is sit
[1:01:49] there with your head spinning what's
[1:01:51] going on what's going on
[1:01:52] ouch that hurt what's going on why are
[1:01:54] they taking this right away from me and
[1:01:56] why are they putting me over here and
[1:01:57] why can i not pray for that brother
[1:01:59] anymore what is going on
[1:02:00] help me no we want to prepare ourselves
[1:02:05] want to prepare ourselves so that when
[1:02:08] these things transpire
[1:02:09] we'll recognize them for what they are
[1:02:11] and when that combine starts
[1:02:13] ripping stuff off of us we don't start
[1:02:16] questioning our sonship or our position
[1:02:18] we simply recognize it for what it is
[1:02:20] and here's what i'll tell you is if you
[1:02:22] start going through that process of
[1:02:24] having stuff ripped off of you right now
[1:02:26] your confusion is going to be way less
[1:02:28] when that transpires
[1:02:29] because you're going to wake up and
[1:02:31] something's going to get ripped off of
[1:02:32] you and you'll be like oh
[1:02:35] well that felt like that thing that i
[1:02:38] ripped off yesterday
[1:02:40] maybe this is just the same process
[1:02:44] it's going to be less confusing
[1:02:48] and you know what maybe that being less
[1:02:51] confused isn't even for your benefit
[1:02:54] but maybe there'll be somebody a new
[1:02:56] believer right there beside of you who
[1:02:57] is seed
[1:02:59] who hasn't been exposed to all the
[1:03:01] teaching and
[1:03:02] and laid in the presence of the sun as
[1:03:04] long as we have that maybe we can be a
[1:03:06] benefit to them because we're not as
[1:03:07] confused
[1:03:09] it may not be may not even be for your
[1:03:11] benefit
[1:03:12] it may be you being in that position of
[1:03:15] being steady
[1:03:16] and as our pastor taught us sunday i've
[1:03:18] already been in a position of
[1:03:20] trusting the father to where when these
[1:03:23] things get
[1:03:24] starts getting stripped off left and
[1:03:26] right we can hold steady
[1:03:29] and we can say just trust the father are
[1:03:31] you his son
[1:03:32] are you his daughter just hold steady
[1:03:36] just let it go let it go it's hybrid you
[1:03:39] don't need it anyhow it's shock
[1:03:41] just let it go
[1:03:50] we've read those quotes now let's go
[1:03:51] back to chapter 8 28
[1:03:53] then jesus said unto them when ye have
[1:03:56] lifted
[1:03:57] up the son of man do you think it was
[1:04:00] optional whether or not the son of man
[1:04:02] got lifted up
[1:04:06] it was not optional it was going to
[1:04:09] happen
[1:04:11] but jesus did not lift himself up
[1:04:17] what lifted jesus up
[1:04:22] civil and ecclesiastical powers
[1:04:28] chapter 19
[1:04:31] then pilate therefore took jesus and
[1:04:35] scourged him
[1:04:37] just stay with me a little bit longer
[1:04:39] we're finishing with this scripture
[1:04:43] then pilate therefore took jesus and
[1:04:46] scourged him
[1:04:48] and the soldiers there's your two
[1:04:52] political powers civil powers
[1:04:59] we'll get to the religious few verses
[1:05:03] down
[1:05:04] but notice who is involved here then
[1:05:08] pilate therefore took jesus and scorched
[1:05:10] him
[1:05:11] and the soldiers platted a crown of
[1:05:13] thorns and put it on his head
[1:05:14] and they put him on a purple robe and
[1:05:17] said hell
[1:05:18] king of the jews and they smote him with
[1:05:22] their hands
[1:05:23] pilate therefore went again and saith
[1:05:25] unto them unto them
[1:05:27] behold i bring him forth to you that ye
[1:05:30] may know that i find
[1:05:31] no fault in him
[1:05:34] that's a life saints that's a life
[1:05:38] that's the testimony that i want the
[1:05:40] people surrounding my life
[1:05:43] to be able to say when that combine
[1:05:45] comes to start beating me out
[1:05:47] why are you all doing that i don't find
[1:05:49] any fault in him
[1:05:51] that's the life that i want to live then
[1:05:53] jesus came forth wearing the crown of
[1:05:55] thorns in the purple robe
[1:05:57] you think this was comfortable in his
[1:05:59] flesh at this point
[1:06:02] and pilate saith unto them behold the
[1:06:05] man
[1:06:06] when the chief priest therefore in the
[1:06:08] officer saw him
[1:06:09] there's your third one the chief priest
[1:06:13] there's your civil and ecclesiastical
[1:06:16] powers
[1:06:18] with the political leader of that day
[1:06:21] the army the political leader and the
[1:06:24] chief priest the religious sect
[1:06:26] therefore in the officer saw him they
[1:06:28] cried out saying
[1:06:29] crucify him crucify him pilate saith
[1:06:32] unto them take
[1:06:33] him and crucify him for i find no fault
[1:06:36] in him
[1:06:43] this is shocking to me
[1:06:50] take him and crucify him
[1:06:53] but i don't find any fault in it
[1:06:58] why would a man
[1:07:02] having found no fault
[1:07:06] in somebody say crucify him
[1:07:13] is because the civil and ecclesiastical
[1:07:16] powers
[1:07:18] had something to say to pilate whenever
[1:07:19] he tried to talk him out of this
[1:07:22] they said if you don't go along with
[1:07:24] this scheme if you don't take our side
[1:07:26] you're an enemy to caesar
[1:07:35] see it's the same thing that's going to
[1:07:38] transpire in our day
[1:07:41] brother branham said sorry to get away
[1:07:43] from this but this is just fresh so take
[1:07:45] it
[1:07:46] brother branham said the image to the
[1:07:48] beast joins together to fight communism
[1:07:55] you don't want to fight communism
[1:08:02] you don't want to fight communism so
[1:08:04] you're for them
[1:08:05] you're you're against caesar
[1:08:09] see the trap see the spirits
[1:08:13] it's the same thing you're not
[1:08:16] against communism you don't you don't
[1:08:18] want to fight against communism you got
[1:08:20] to be for it
[1:08:21] you're an enemy against us see the image
[1:08:25] to the beast is its intention
[1:08:28] is not the
[1:08:32] message believers to begin with
[1:08:37] that's not the problem that's not what
[1:08:38] they're coming to fight they're coming
[1:08:40] brother branham says they join together
[1:08:43] to fight
[1:08:44] communism he did not say they joined
[1:08:47] together
[1:08:47] to fight the true bride
[1:08:51] they join together to fight communism
[1:08:56] but now here's a group of people
[1:09:01] that says if my subjects were of this
[1:09:05] world they would fight
[1:09:09] but they're not of this world so they're
[1:09:10] not going to take up arms they're not
[1:09:12] going to get into your fight
[1:09:17] you mean you're for liberalism
[1:09:23] you're not a conservative you're not a
[1:09:26] conservative
[1:09:26] you're for liberalism no i'm neither
[1:09:30] i'm neither no it's not a if you're not
[1:09:33] for conservatism
[1:09:35] you're you're against caesar it's the
[1:09:38] same thing
[1:09:40] you have to pick a side you have to pick
[1:09:42] a side
[1:09:43] if you're not for us you're against us
[1:09:47] they join together to fight communism
[1:09:50] and when the true bride says communism
[1:09:53] is not my fight
[1:09:53] no i'm not for communism but communism
[1:09:55] is not my fight
[1:09:57] i'm not of this world that's a worldly
[1:09:58] fight that's not my fight
[1:10:00] i don't my that's that's i don't have a
[1:10:02] horse in that race
[1:10:04] it's not for me
[1:10:08] they joined together to fight communism
[1:10:11] and now here's an outside
[1:10:13] people that won't join with them
[1:10:17] declaring themselves to be christians
[1:10:20] but they won't join with them to fight
[1:10:22] communism
[1:10:25] that's when they'll eat their own
[1:10:29] you may have the title or be under the
[1:10:33] title
[1:10:34] of christianity but if you are not
[1:10:37] willing to fight
[1:10:37] communism with us you are an enemy to
[1:10:40] seizure
[1:10:42] and we're going to go tell them
[1:10:45] that is why pilate
[1:10:52] could look at them and say i find no
[1:10:54] fault in them
[1:10:56] i find no fault in him but take him and
[1:10:59] crucify him
[1:11:01] because i i want to keep my church
[1:11:05] i don't want my doors closed
[1:11:08] i don't want my 501 exemption done away
[1:11:11] with
[1:11:15] the pattern is laying there saints it's
[1:11:17] not going anywhere we're not going to
[1:11:19] change it
[1:11:20] you sound boy this is dreary it is kind
[1:11:22] of dreary i admit let me give you
[1:11:26] something to lighten it up
[1:11:34] verse 7 the jews answered them him
[1:11:37] we have a law and by our law
[1:11:40] he ought to die because he made himself
[1:11:45] the son of god
[1:11:48] when pilate therefore therefore heard
[1:11:51] that saying he was the more afraid
[1:11:54] but yet he never did anything about it
[1:11:58] and went again into the judgment hall
[1:12:00] and saith unto jesus
[1:12:01] whence art thou but jesus
[1:12:05] gave him no answer then sayeth pilate
[1:12:08] unto him
[1:12:09] speakest thou not unto me knowest thou
[1:12:12] not that i have power to crucify thee
[1:12:14] and have power to release thee
[1:12:18] here's the silver lining in your cloud
[1:12:23] and this is the last of these other
[1:12:25] things
[1:12:26] that jesus spake before he was
[1:12:28] transformed
[1:12:33] jesus answered thou couldest have
[1:12:36] no power at all against me except it
[1:12:39] were given thee from above
[1:12:43] therefore he that delivered me unto thee
[1:12:45] hath the greater sin
[1:12:48] that's your consultation saints not
[1:12:51] consultation
[1:12:51] consolation that
[1:12:55] is your revelation that is your keeping
[1:12:58] power
[1:12:59] just like a pastor was preaching sunday
[1:13:02] trust is what was lost in the beginning
[1:13:05] trust is what has to be restored at the
[1:13:06] end if you don't
[1:13:08] fully trust in your heavenly father
[1:13:11] to take care of you you're going to have
[1:13:14] a rough way coming
[1:13:17] you are going to be confused you are
[1:13:19] going to you're going to be dazed
[1:13:22] you are going to have a you're going to
[1:13:23] make it but you're going to have a tough
[1:13:26] time making it and you're sure not going
[1:13:28] to be a help to your brother and sister
[1:13:33] we've got to come to full trust in our
[1:13:36] father
[1:13:38] just in our daily lives
[1:13:42] right now right now before that
[1:13:46] pressure comes before that squeeze comes
[1:13:49] right now we have to trust him in carnal
[1:13:51] things
[1:13:53] let's just be real real about it for a
[1:13:56] second
[1:13:58] if your mortgage is not paid next month
[1:14:01] that has nothing to do with your
[1:14:02] spiritual outcome correct
[1:14:06] is that going to be a comfortable thing
[1:14:07] to deal with no but it's
[1:14:09] not going to affect your spiritual
[1:14:11] outcome
[1:14:13] if you don't eat tomorrow that's
[1:14:16] not going to affect your spiritual
[1:14:18] outcome
[1:14:20] you see what i'm getting at
[1:14:24] if you say i don't see any fault in her
[1:14:29] but go ahead and crucify her that
[1:14:32] is going to affect your spiritual
[1:14:33] outcome
[1:14:35] and if you don't come to a position of
[1:14:38] full
[1:14:38] trust in your heavenly father right now
[1:14:45] the pressure that is going to come from
[1:14:48] that
[1:14:48] civil and ecclesiastical squeeze
[1:14:53] is not going to be
[1:14:56] easy it's not going to be easy period
[1:15:00] but it is it is going to stand a lot
[1:15:03] a lot greater possibility of you
[1:15:06] doing something that you would not have
[1:15:09] normally done with a proper revelation
[1:15:12] it is going that pressure that is coming
[1:15:15] has one goal it is not for your torture
[1:15:20] it is not for your punishment it is not
[1:15:22] for anything else but to
[1:15:24] make sure you have full trust in your
[1:15:26] heavenly father
[1:15:27] that's all it is because brother branham
[1:15:30] says
[1:15:31] she's not going to be killed she's not
[1:15:34] just going to be manhandled and tortured
[1:15:36] and whatever else
[1:15:37] he says he's not going to put his bride
[1:15:39] through that he's not going to do that
[1:15:43] and i've heard this preach both ends of
[1:15:45] the spectrum i mean i've heard it
[1:15:46] preached where we're eating the bark off
[1:15:48] the trees
[1:15:49] because we don't have anything to eat
[1:15:50] and i've heard it to where we're not
[1:15:51] going to face one bit of trib
[1:15:53] of persecution but there's a middle of
[1:15:55] the road and i don't know what that
[1:15:56] middle of the road is i'm being honest
[1:15:58] with you i don't have a clue
[1:16:00] i'll put it this way one of you may be
[1:16:03] eating the bark off the trees
[1:16:05] and the other one has plenty to eat
[1:16:12] there is nothing that says god has to
[1:16:14] meet each and everyone's needs
[1:16:15] by the same manner he may let one of us
[1:16:19] be eating bark
[1:16:20] off of the trees just to have the other
[1:16:22] one make sure they have a proper
[1:16:23] revelation
[1:16:24] that my heavenly father can take care of
[1:16:26] them just as well as he can take care of
[1:16:27] me
[1:16:27] you know what that person may be eating
[1:16:29] bark off of the trees
[1:16:31] and it's the best bark they've ever had
[1:16:34] it has
[1:16:35] nutrients in it that they have to have
[1:16:38] it's it it makes them live
[1:16:41] it sustains them and this person over
[1:16:44] here
[1:16:45] that we've made fun of for the last
[1:16:47] three months of hoarding up food
[1:16:49] they're eating fine because god anointed
[1:16:52] them to hoard up food
[1:16:54] but god didn't anoint that person to
[1:16:56] hoard up food so don't try to preach at
[1:16:58] his doctor that you need to hoard up
[1:16:59] food
[1:17:01] you see what i mean
[1:17:04] god can answer each individual
[1:17:08] situation different ways and it can be
[1:17:11] right
[1:17:12] and it can be completely different you
[1:17:16] can have somebody eating bark off of the
[1:17:18] trees
[1:17:18] and it sustains them just fine you could
[1:17:21] have somebody that hoarded food for
[1:17:22] three months because
[1:17:23] god spoke to them and told them lay up
[1:17:25] food
[1:17:26] or you could have somebody that didn't
[1:17:28] either
[1:17:29] and god says just speak what you want to
[1:17:31] eat today
[1:17:34] see saints let's not put them in a box
[1:17:37] and say it's got to be this way this is
[1:17:38] the way it's coming this is what this is
[1:17:39] what's going to transpire
[1:17:40] this is how god's going to fix he can do
[1:17:44] any of that
[1:17:44] and he can i mean i'm sure there's a
[1:17:46] whole other list of other things that he
[1:17:48] can do
[1:17:48] to meet each and every individual's need
[1:17:51] he may be that you go on a three-month
[1:17:53] fast
[1:17:54] you don't even need to eat i don't know
[1:17:57] i don't know how it's going to be all i
[1:18:00] know is the purpose of all of it
[1:18:02] will be tailor-made to the individual
[1:18:04] that you trust your heavenly father
[1:18:06] and you will be able to say to whatever
[1:18:08] pressure and whatever squeeze
[1:18:09] and whatever demonic form comes against
[1:18:12] you in whatever manifestation that it
[1:18:14] comes against you
[1:18:15] you can look it dead in the eye and say
[1:18:16] you have no power over me unless
[1:18:18] my father and heaven gave it to you
[1:18:22] the lamb is on the throne and the lamb
[1:18:25] is the one that calls the shots
[1:18:27] touch not this touch not that you can
[1:18:30] touch this you can touch that
[1:18:33] we need to have that proper
[1:18:34] understanding i'm not preaching to you
[1:18:36] just now saints i'm preaching to myself
[1:18:38] we better come to that proper
[1:18:40] understanding here and now
[1:18:43] in the good and in the bad it's easy to
[1:18:46] trust
[1:18:46] them when you're flowing down the stream
[1:18:49] row row row your boat
[1:18:51] it's easy to trust him that everything
[1:18:53] will be just fine
[1:18:55] but when you don't see that rock
[1:18:58] and now you're upside down do you still
[1:19:02] trust him whose fault was it that you
[1:19:05] hit the rock it was your fault because
[1:19:07] you were row row rowing your boat gently
[1:19:09] down the stream
[1:19:12] he can still meet your need
[1:19:16] he can steal he is still on the throne
[1:19:20] and he still has the power and there is
[1:19:23] no harm that can come your way
[1:19:25] even if it was your fault that you hit
[1:19:26] the rock
[1:19:28] because you hadn't prepared like you
[1:19:30] should have
[1:19:33] this is the last thing that jesus says
[1:19:35] as the musicians come
[1:19:39] before he's crucified and before he's
[1:19:41] before he's translated
[1:19:42] this is if i would say it this way this
[1:19:44] is the this is the last thing that he
[1:19:47] says to the unbelievers this is the last
[1:19:49] thing that he says
[1:19:50] to the civil and the ecclesiastical
[1:19:53] forces that have joined against him
[1:19:56] this is the last thing that jesus has
[1:19:58] said after he's went through the combine
[1:20:01] after the shuck has been completely
[1:20:02] stripped away from him
[1:20:06] he just looks at it and says you have no
[1:20:08] power over me
[1:20:10] except my father in heaven give you
[1:20:12] power
[1:20:15] i don't know about you but just me
[1:20:16] saints
[1:20:19] i want to come to that proper
[1:20:20] understanding prior to that world
[1:20:22] council of churches
[1:20:24] beating me out
[1:20:27] is the world council of churches going
[1:20:29] to come and beat the weed out yes
[1:20:33] and we may not all take the same beating
[1:20:35] you may get a little beating
[1:20:37] i may get a big beating some may get in
[1:20:41] between
[1:20:43] but we're all going to go through that
[1:20:46] combine
[1:20:48] the combine is civil is a re
[1:20:52] is a politically backed religious
[1:20:55] persecution that's all the combine is
[1:20:57] call it world council of churches call
[1:20:59] it the image to the beast cause it call
[1:21:00] it the ecumenical council
[1:21:02] call it whatever you want but at the end
[1:21:04] of the day it is a politically
[1:21:06] backed persecution that joined together
[1:21:09] to fight communism but then there was a
[1:21:11] little group that wouldn't join with
[1:21:12] them and they turned
[1:21:13] on her that's
[1:21:17] the read the church book it's explicit
[1:21:19] it's very clear
[1:21:23] that is the process and there's nothing
[1:21:25] we can do about it
[1:21:28] i just i want to say this how is the
[1:21:31] wheat
[1:21:32] going to get beat out by the combine
[1:21:34] which is the world council of churches
[1:21:36] if the wheat isn't here
[1:21:40] don't tell me that there's not something
[1:21:42] coming and don't tell me that she goes
[1:21:44] before that
[1:21:46] the wheat cannot be beat out by the
[1:21:49] world council of churches if the wheat
[1:21:50] is not there
[1:21:54] it is to what did brother branham tell
[1:21:56] us it is to separate the shock and the
[1:21:59] seed
[1:22:00] the shucks going to be there the seed is
[1:22:02] going to be there
[1:22:03] and there's going to be a separating and
[1:22:05] he says that combine is the world
[1:22:07] council of churches
[1:22:08] and he says the bride goes through the
[1:22:10] combine up into the elevator
[1:22:13] into the garner don't be trying to get
[1:22:16] to the garner if you don't go through
[1:22:17] the combine
[1:22:19] it's not going to work tell yourself
[1:22:22] that fairy tale doctrine if you want to
[1:22:24] it's not going to happen and you're
[1:22:25] going to be surprised when something
[1:22:26] blindsides you
[1:22:28] i'm not preaching this to be a doomsday
[1:22:30] or a you know
[1:22:32] whatever preacher i'm just preaching to
[1:22:34] the facts saints we don't
[1:22:36] we don't leave under this preaching
[1:22:38] under this teaching so oh this is
[1:22:40] miserable you know i got
[1:22:43] i got nothing to look forward to you
[1:22:45] know what you have to look forward to
[1:22:47] is there's a process coming that is
[1:22:50] going to
[1:22:50] rid you of every hybrid fiber of your
[1:22:53] body
[1:22:57] you say well it's not going to be
[1:22:58] enjoyable would you rather continue as
[1:23:00] you are
[1:23:01] you know what i am i keep quoting
[1:23:04] brother john
[1:23:04] i love that statement that he made he
[1:23:06] said true maturity true
[1:23:08] spiritual maturity is when you get sick
[1:23:11] of yourself
[1:23:12] that is so true but saints i am so sick
[1:23:15] of myself that if i knew where the
[1:23:17] combine was at i would go jump in it
[1:23:20] because i am so hybrid minded and it is
[1:23:23] my hybrid mind and body is has such
[1:23:26] fallacy in it that it don't even have
[1:23:28] the ability to recognize when it's right
[1:23:30] and when it's wrong
[1:23:33] there is nothing good in it the
[1:23:34] scripture says he's the father of lies
[1:23:36] the author of lies he's the murderer
[1:23:38] there's nothing good in that
[1:23:39] hybridization
[1:23:41] but it's so bad that your mind
[1:23:44] it doesn't even know whether it's right
[1:23:45] or wrong
[1:23:47] it it takes only spiritual
[1:23:51] revelation to be able to discern that
[1:23:54] but i am so sick of trying to figure out
[1:23:57] whether i'm right or i'm wrong
[1:24:00] show me where the combine's at
[1:24:05] i'm not changing what the prophet said
[1:24:07] but i want to go through this combine
[1:24:09] before i go through that combine
[1:24:11] because if i can go through this combine
[1:24:14] and judge myself as the scripture says
[1:24:18] when that civil and ecclesiastical power
[1:24:20] comes and it will come
[1:24:22] to beat the wheat out i don't want to be
[1:24:25] surprised for that process
[1:24:26] and i don't want to be having to fight
[1:24:28] that process it's
[1:24:30] not going to be pleasant it's not going
[1:24:31] to be enjoyable but it has no power over
[1:24:34] you unless god allows it to do something
[1:24:36] and what he's allowing it to do is not
[1:24:38] for your punishment it's not for your
[1:24:40] chastisement
[1:24:41] it is for you to trust him and to get
[1:24:44] rid of every hybrid fiber in your body
[1:24:48] to go into the elevator and go into the
[1:24:51] glory
[1:24:51] and the presence of god that's what i
[1:24:55] desire
[1:24:56] that's what i want and if it's an
[1:25:00] uncomfortable process to get there
[1:25:03] i still want that process because the
[1:25:05] patterns in the scripture
[1:25:07] we're not going to change the pattern
[1:25:08] it's the same pattern jesus went through
[1:25:10] it's the same thing that we have to go
[1:25:13] through
[1:25:14] we're not going to change that pattern
[1:25:18] but what i want to do is i want to
[1:25:20] recognize
[1:25:22] the antichrist spirit within my own
[1:25:25] framework
[1:25:26] each and every day
[1:25:29] i want to discern that as much as he
[1:25:32] will sovereignly allow me
[1:25:34] and i want to give him the preeminence
[1:25:36] and i want to die to myself
[1:25:39] to where when that process comes
[1:25:42] it's not such a resistance
[1:25:45] and i'm going to close with this last
[1:25:46] thing
[1:25:50] the seed goes into the ground
[1:25:53] the seed comes up through a stalk goes
[1:25:56] into a
[1:25:57] shock comes out of seed again we know
[1:26:00] this process we've heard it
[1:26:02] hundreds probably thousands of times for
[1:26:04] you old-timers
[1:26:07] when that seed comes to seed
[1:26:12] you tell me one other way
[1:26:15] that it gets into the garner without a
[1:26:19] mechanical
[1:26:20] man-made process taking effect
[1:26:28] it can't
[1:26:31] when that wheat corn whatever it is
[1:26:35] comes back to seed if there
[1:26:38] is not a man-made mechanical
[1:26:41] intervention to cut that off
[1:26:45] and to put it into the father's house it
[1:26:48] falls off
[1:26:50] and it goes right back in starts the
[1:26:52] process over
[1:26:54] or it just hangs there and rots
[1:27:00] i don't want to rot and i don't want to
[1:27:03] fall over
[1:27:04] and have 6 000 more years of this hybrid
[1:27:06] process
[1:27:08] the mechanical process is not going to
[1:27:11] be comfortable
[1:27:12] it's going to cut you away from your
[1:27:14] your shuck
[1:27:16] but it's going to put you into the
[1:27:17] garner let's stand together
[1:27:22] but let's not move forward
[1:27:26] with this false thinking that there's
[1:27:29] not a squeeze coming
[1:27:30] that there's not a politically backed
[1:27:32] persecution coming
[1:27:33] i'm not here to tell you what form
[1:27:35] that's going to come in
[1:27:36] i don't know i know what the prophet
[1:27:39] taught
[1:27:40] we can see some things but i don't know
[1:27:44] and i don't to be honest with you i
[1:27:45] don't know that i even want to know
[1:27:47] because again the process you go through
[1:27:50] is probably going to be different than
[1:27:51] the process i go through
[1:27:53] it'll have different angles it's not
[1:27:55] just going to be a cookie cutter process
[1:27:59] and like i told you whenever i told you
[1:28:02] a while back
[1:28:03] i'm not here when that's
[1:28:06] when that religious when that
[1:28:09] politically backed
[1:28:10] religious persecution comes
[1:28:14] i am not going to be the one when they
[1:28:17] close the church doors
[1:28:18] to say well i can take i can take that i
[1:28:22] can handle that
[1:28:24] what else you got i'll stick around for
[1:28:26] more no saints
[1:28:28] when i see a politically backed
[1:28:30] persecution in the smallest form
[1:28:33] i'm looking for my atoms to change i'm
[1:28:36] not here to be a tough guy
[1:28:38] i'm not here to get stuck in the combine
[1:28:42] and get ground away to dust i'm not here
[1:28:44] to bounce around in a combine
[1:28:46] have you ever seen a corn of wheat go or
[1:28:48] a
[1:28:49] air corn go through a combine it is not
[1:28:51] a fun process
[1:28:52] it's bouncing around it's going up and
[1:28:54] down and sideways in every other way
[1:28:56] it's getting belts run all over top of
[1:28:58] it they're probably the most amazing
[1:29:00] machine ever invented just by the way
[1:29:03] but i'm not here to say
[1:29:07] that feels good or i can take some more
[1:29:10] or what else you got
[1:29:12] when i see a politically backed
[1:29:14] religious persecution against the true
[1:29:16] bride of christ i'll even say it this
[1:29:19] much
[1:29:19] i don't even have to have it come my way
[1:29:21] if i see it come your way that's good
[1:29:23] enough for me
[1:29:24] that's a that fulfills the scripture i'm
[1:29:27] good to go
[1:29:28] i'm good to go take me out of here so
[1:29:31] it's not about you know
[1:29:32] preaching this way so we get tough and
[1:29:34] we resist it and no saints i'm looking
[1:29:36] for the garner
[1:29:38] but i'm not going to defy prophecy and
[1:29:41] scripture
[1:29:41] to get there i want to have a proper
[1:29:45] understanding
[1:29:46] and i want to die daily and get my shock
[1:29:50] away from me
[1:29:52] i want to have a proper revelation and
[1:29:54] say these other things now
[1:29:57] to get my shock away from me not worried
[1:30:00] about the other shock
[1:30:01] i want to get my shock away from me
[1:30:04] by saying these things and repeating
[1:30:07] these things
[1:30:08] so that i can say my doctrine is not my
[1:30:10] own it is he that sent me
[1:30:13] i am who i am by the grace of god
[1:30:16] and i am willing to do what the
[1:30:18] scriptures say i must do
[1:30:20] for my hybridization to pass off the
[1:30:22] scene
[1:30:23] if you'll play something softly let's
[1:30:25] pray together
[1:30:26] precious heavenly father we just want to
[1:30:28] thank you once again for this time that
[1:30:30] you've given us
[1:30:31] lord i've been more lengthy than i
[1:30:33] intended to be but i pray that you would
[1:30:35] just
[1:30:35] take the things that have been spoken
[1:30:38] lord
[1:30:39] would you just come and give each and
[1:30:42] every one of us the proper understanding
[1:30:46] of what we have to look forward to
[1:30:49] lord we do not have a gloomy
[1:30:53] disposition moving forward
[1:30:57] we want to move forward
[1:31:01] with a trust in our heavenly father
[1:31:06] that whatsoever you see fit to
[1:31:10] bring by our way to bring an
[1:31:13] end to this hybrid process that we would
[1:31:17] not
[1:31:17] resist that that we would not cling to
[1:31:21] ourselves
[1:31:21] but we would lay our lives down daily
[1:31:25] and we would trust in you daily
[1:31:28] to take care of us and that we would
[1:31:31] recognize and have assurance
[1:31:34] that there is no power of evil civil
[1:31:37] or ecclesiastical that has any dominion
[1:31:40] over the true bride of christ except for
[1:31:43] what the father allows and we take
[1:31:46] comfort in that lord and we believe that
[1:31:49] and we want to live a life worthy of
[1:31:52] that
[1:31:53] we want to live a life worthy of the
[1:31:56] whole gospel that you've presented to us
[1:31:59] not just the good lord but everything
[1:32:03] we thank you for the truth that you have
[1:32:05] brought to us in this day
[1:32:07] in this age and lord there are many
[1:32:10] things
[1:32:10] that we look at and we don't understand
[1:32:12] there's many things that we
[1:32:14] don't know how they're going to
[1:32:15] transpire but lord we
[1:32:17] know who is in control and we
[1:32:20] rest in that and i pray that you would
[1:32:22] just grant to
[1:32:23] me and each and every one present here
[1:32:26] tonight
[1:32:27] a more thorough understanding and
[1:32:31] revelation of that
[1:32:33] we ask these things in the name of the
[1:32:35] lord jesus christ
[1:32:36] thanking you once again amen

[1:34:53] and dust is rolling it's loud it's
[1:34:56] noisy lots happening and everything's
[1:34:59] coming in
[1:35:00] and getting all mixed up and but you
[1:35:02] ever seen it shooting out all of the
[1:35:04] shock and all the stalk out back
[1:35:07] it stays on earth all of that
[1:35:11] stays on earth but then all
[1:35:14] that wheat that was separated from one
[1:35:17] another all that wheat
[1:35:18] that stood and you know stood on the
[1:35:20] stalk and still stood in what dry part
[1:35:22] of the chuck remain
[1:35:24] and stood over here and stood over there
[1:35:26] it all gets brought together
[1:35:28] and all gets lifted to the same place
[1:35:31] amen and by the time you you start
[1:35:34] through the process there's all kinds of
[1:35:37] dirt and dust and shuck and stalk and
[1:35:40] all kinds of stuff mixed together but by
[1:35:42] the time you get to the process

[1:36:05] seed of god because there's nothing else

[1:36:28] things and not say it in the flesh and
[1:36:30] not

[1:36:32] want your spirit
[1:36:34] speaking your word through me so there's
[1:36:36] no self-declaration but i'm only
[1:36:38] declaring your word

[1:36:42] only do the father's will we're
[1:36:44] we're not lifting up we're not declaring
[1:36:46] ourselves do we when you say what the
[1:36:48] word says it's not in a measure of
[1:36:50] self-declaration for self-glorification
[1:36:52] but all we're doing is exalting him
[1:36:56] because he has said and he
[1:36:59] has done he has declared by spiritual
[1:37:03] revelation i know
[1:37:04] this to be true amen because of the
[1:37:06] father

[1:37:19] speak it from a pure heart
[1:37:21] and i want that word to have life-giving

[1:37:35] i think we can surrender more i think we
[1:37:37] want to surrender more
[1:37:40] amen let's just bow our heads and ask
[1:37:42] the lord's blessing over the word

[1:37:46] lord jesus we thank you god for the
[1:37:48] reminder you've given us tonight
[1:37:51] and we thank you for using lord the
[1:37:53] vessel of our brother to speak to us
[1:37:56] and god may we enjoy the word that
[1:37:59] you've given us the revelation the
[1:38:01] understanding
[1:38:02] may it take all fear away lord because
[1:38:06] it's an
[1:38:06] expression of your love your revelation
[1:38:10] by peeling back the mystery by
[1:38:12] telling us before when you told your
[1:38:14] disciples before so that when these
[1:38:16] things happen they would know it was an
[1:38:17] expression of your love for them
[1:38:20] and when you tell us before it's an
[1:38:22] expression of your love
[1:38:24] showing us who we are and that our
[1:38:26] destination is secure
[1:38:27] and that you've never lost sight of us
[1:38:29] and know there's no weapon formed
[1:38:31] against us that can destroy us
[1:38:33] nothing can have power over us unless
[1:38:34] you first approve it
[1:38:36] lord and you've told us this before to
[1:38:38] show your love
[1:38:39] so that love will have an effect because
[1:38:41] perfect love will cast out all fear
[1:38:44] and you've told us these things lord by
[1:38:46] identifying who we are in our position
[1:38:48] and the age we live in
[1:38:50] and what the prophet has told us about
[1:38:52] the end time events
[1:38:53] lord not to create fear but to show your
[1:38:56] love lord
[1:38:57] to bring us to an expected end amen to
[1:38:59] dispel all fear
[1:39:02] now we surrender to you in this perfect
[1:39:04] love
[1:39:05] that you already have a plan and your
[1:39:07] plan is perfect
[1:39:08] just as perfect as it was when any of
[1:39:10] your believers ever walked this earth is
[1:39:12] just as perfect today
[1:39:14] you have a plan and you have a purpose
[1:39:16] and we're yielding to that purpose lord
[1:39:18] and trusting in your plan
[1:39:20] we're declaring afresh tonight that we
[1:39:22] trust you lord
[1:39:24] i pray you take us and use us for your
[1:39:26] glory
[1:39:27] as we leave here tonight lord may the
[1:39:29] things we've heard not fade away but
[1:39:31] may they become more real to us day by
[1:39:33] day
[1:39:34] as we surrender lord and all of self is
[1:39:38] baked out and all the immaturity and
[1:39:40] selfishness
[1:39:41] is gone maybe just reflect your life
[1:39:44] more and more
[1:39:45] and trust you more carry us home safely
[1:39:48] lord
[1:39:49] use us for your glory we pray in jesus
[1:39:53] christ's name
[1:39:54] amen
[1:39:57] amen when jesus went through his trial
[1:39:59] and his persecution
[1:40:02] his crucifixion and his death he went
[1:40:04] through all that
[1:40:06] for redemption he went through all that
[1:40:08] for love
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:11] and if we have to go through a little
[1:40:12] bit of a a trial
[1:40:14] a little squeeze what will it produce
[1:40:18] the fullness of redemption and that's
[1:40:21] what i'm looking for
