TRANSCRIPT
========================================
how many of you been healed by the word amen healing is never left but neither has prophesying or discernment left amen because everything that was in the firstborn second pole is in the third pool because it's the fullness of the word it's the full person of the word amen who heals you Jesus Christ heals you and he's the third pull he's the opening of the word he's the one who's here amen who was Discerning the thoughts and thoughts and hearts of the people was brother Branham Discerning their thoughts and heart or was it God Discerning their thoughts in their hearts how many times amen under the preaching of the word in this day is your thoughts and your heart and your conversations being discerned I had a brother to tell me from Wednesday night that there was an absolute manifestation of discernment of conversation word for word going on I had no clue it wasn't me doing any discernment I don't have a gift of discernment but the person of the word is present and with him is every Power and promise that's in the word and every manifestation is here that's why we want the third pull we want the word we want the person of the word I don't want to stop at a first pull and get super excited and enthused about that I want to go all the way to unite with the person of the word because with him it's first pull second pull with him is every promise with him is the Fulfillment of every word and with him is every Miracle amen every Miracle that's ever been worked is in him every Power that's ever been manifest is in him I want to go all the way to him that's why to me it's the most important thing in the world is to get people all the way in amen and how to bring them the revelation of the word present tense for our day and not something a Pentecostal can preach and not something a Pentecostal can do but something that's beyond that amen something that'll hook the rainbow trout and once they're hooked they're coming in friends once they see this word once they come in contact with the reality of the word in this day it doesn't matter they're coming all the way in because they were hooked by the third pool got a hold of the fish how are they going to miss the Rapture they're hooked to it amen how are they not going to land in the boat they're hooked to it how were they hooked they were hooked by the opening of the word in this day that the revelation of the seven Thunders and the Mystery of God has been opened that's why we preach every day that's the emphasis of our life that's everything to us because in that is everything
