[1:19] baptized at the end of service this
[1:21] morning
[1:22] while the my brother aaron was preaching
[1:24] last sunday god began to prick her heart
[1:26] god began to call and she knew god was
[1:28] calling her and she was able to respond
[1:31] and
[1:31] now she'd like for the world to know
[1:33] that she's accepted the lord's

[2:10] about it
[2:11] but i've been working conspiring with
[2:13] his wife behind the scenes
[2:15] and with the trustees but brother tom
[2:17] you know the lord has
[2:18] has used him as a song leader in the
[2:20] assembly for a long
[2:22] long time and even before this assembly
[2:24] was a song leader he's been leading
[2:25] songs over 50 years
[2:27] and god finally told him it was time to
[2:29] stop and brother thomas decided to
[2:31] retire
[2:32] just a couple months ago after he was
[2:33] really sick and
[2:35] we've been waiting for things to get
[2:37] better get easier so we could do
[2:38] something for brother tom
[2:40] so we decided to go ahead and do
[2:41] something out in the pavilion uh

[2:46] about four o'clock
[2:47] we'll gather there we'll have coffee

[3:01] that if you're able to make plans
[3:03] um we're gonna we're gonna have
[3:04] different ones speak we're gonna say a

[3:11] to give to brother tom at that at that
[3:13] time we would like to just
[3:15] just thank him from the bottom of our
[3:17] hearts for all he's done for us
[3:19] so god bless you brother tommy we love
[3:20] you i'm going to say thank you let's
[3:22] give him a hand
[3:29] so i hope you'll forgive me for
[3:30] springing that on me but i asked your
[3:32] wife first
[3:34] i had permission amen so let's let's
[3:36] make sure we remember that we'll put
[3:38] something on the overhead to remind
[3:39] everybody but
[3:40] i just want to i you know things happen
[3:43] so fast in our life you move from one
[3:44] event to the next and
[3:46] things change and i don't want to take i
[3:48] don't want to forget to take time to
[3:49] stop
[3:50] and think about what god's done and
[3:52] thank god for what he's done
[3:53] these are special things and the life of
[3:55] service that brother tom
[3:57] and sister barb have lived for this
[3:58] assembly are worthy of a big thank you
[4:01] and i don't want to just let time
[4:03] twitter away and forget these things
[4:05] that are important
[4:06] and we want to do that so thank god for
[4:08] that opportunity
[4:10] let's look at acts chapter 15. we'll
[4:13] read one verse and we'll let you be
[4:14] seated
[4:16] the book of acts chapter 15
[4:22] in verse 18 known
[4:25] unto god are all his works from the
[4:28] beginning of the world
[4:30] amen what a statement that's such a
[4:32] simple verse something we already know
[4:34] but i think it's going to take us the
[4:36] rest of our lives to fully encapsulate
[4:39] the understanding of what that actually
[4:41] means but known unto god are all his
[4:43] works
[4:44] from the beginning of the world that
[4:46] means god is not now
[4:48] trying to decide what he should do next
[4:50] he knows what he's going to do next he's
[4:51] not waiting for circumstances to unfold
[4:54] and watch the way they unfold and then
[4:55] choose what he'll do after that
[4:57] before the world began he knew what he
[4:59] would do
[5:00] his works are known to him from before
[5:02] the foundation of the world amen so
[5:04] nothing is going to disrupt that plan
[5:06] amen and we are that plan we're part of
[5:08] that plan
[5:09] let's bow our heads and ask the lord's
[5:11] blessing over the word
[5:12] dear lord jesus we thank you father for
[5:14] this wonderful word that you've given us
[5:16] today
[5:17] we thank you god for the opportunity to
[5:19] gather like this to
[5:21] just praise your name to worship you
[5:23] lord with the freedom that you've given
[5:25] us
[5:26] freedom from bondage freedom from
[5:28] denominational understanding freedom
[5:30] from confusion lord but
[5:31] you've lifted us out of that lord to
[5:33] understand whom we worship and who we
[5:35] are
[5:36] and god with a joyful heart we just want
[5:38] to give you praise
[5:40] and lord we come to this part of the
[5:42] service where we we come to feed from
[5:44] your hand lord we're asking you to break
[5:45] the bread of life to us
[5:47] that we might feed from you our great
[5:48] shepherd and you might give us what we
[5:51] need for the journey
[5:52] and that all that we do with the
[5:53] strength we gain today would be pleasing
[5:55] unto you
[5:56] lord we thank you for this little baby
[5:58] that you've given to brother dry and
[6:00] sister rebecca
[6:01] we thank you for life for life is a
[6:03] precious thing
[6:04] lord we ask that you'd bless the
[6:06] recovery help them to get home the
[6:08] family to come back together quickly
[6:10] and help everything to go well bless
[6:12] bless us today
[6:14] your children lord as we feed from you
[6:16] in jesus name we pray
[6:18] amen you can each be seated
[6:21] i'm i want to talk about
[6:24] this morning the subject of placed suns
[6:27] placed suns
[6:28] not just suns but placed suns we're
[6:30] going to begin talking
[6:32] a little bit about adoption and this is
[6:35] actually a
[6:36] giant subject it's huge i've been
[6:37] looking at it for some time and
[6:39] and just by my nature i tend to like to
[6:43] have
[6:43] everything nailed down you know really
[6:45] tight before i begin to move forward and
[6:47] i've been looking at this
[6:48] adoption for some time and i've been
[6:49] thinking you know before i begin
[6:50] preaching that
[6:51] there's five books i don't know why
[6:53] there's five books i want to read
[6:54] right in a row and so i'm starting
[6:56] reading those and
[6:57] and i thought you know what i'm just
[6:59] gonna start preaching as god leads he'll
[7:01] put all the pieces together for us as we
[7:03] go
[7:04] and so i'm excited to see where god
[7:06] takes us in this
[7:07] and there's there's many different
[7:08] facets to that and so hopefully we just
[7:11] broach the subject today
[7:12] and see where god will lead us but for
[7:14] me the the
[7:16] foundation is what we started with in
[7:18] the scripture the foundation for
[7:20] everything is known unto god are all his
[7:22] works from the beginning of the world
[7:24] god knows what's going to happen he
[7:26] knows what's going what's going to
[7:28] transpire
[7:29] he has a plan of action and he's working
[7:31] his plan and if we are
[7:32] part of god we are part of his plan
[7:35] nothing is happening out of kilter with
[7:37] us
[7:37] everything is ticking right on time god
[7:40] knows what it is we're going to do
[7:41] god knows what it is he wants for us to
[7:43] accomplish amen some of these things may
[7:45] be great mysteries to us and we may
[7:47] we may battle over it in our mind and we
[7:49] may talk about or or ponder over
[7:52] what would the lord want me to do what
[7:54] is my position in the church
[7:56] amen what is my position in the body
[7:58] those are things that we might ponder or
[8:00] wonder
[8:01] our muse over in ourselves but the fact
[8:03] is god already knows
[8:05] he already knows he's already determined
[8:06] it amen all we need to do is
[8:08] rest and walk into the plan that he has
[8:11] for us
[8:13] in the adoption series in the first
[8:15] message he preached an adoption in 1960
[8:17] he says the bible teaching is usually a
[8:20] little treacherous
[8:23] a little you know kind of walking out on
[8:24] thin ice we call it
[8:27] and this is a statement that many have
[8:30] used
[8:32] to caution against teaching but i want
[8:33] to read the rest of the quote
[8:35] the bible teaching usually a little
[8:36] treacherous a little you know kind of
[8:38] walking out on thin ice we call it
[8:40] but we just feel that maybe at this
[8:42] point and at this time it might be good
[8:44] to kind of bring the church
[8:45] to what i think to a complete
[8:47] understanding positionally
[8:49] of what we are in christ jesus and
[8:51] sometimes they think that preaching is a
[8:52] wonderful thing but i believe sometimes
[8:54] brother beeler
[8:55] that teaching goes beyond that economy
[8:57] especially to the church
[8:59] now preaching usually catches the sinner
[9:02] brings him under condemnation by the
[9:03] word
[9:04] but teaching places a man positionally
[9:06] what he is and we can never
[9:09] rightly be able to have faith until
[9:11] positionally we know what we
[9:12] are doing so if you just take brother
[9:15] behind
[9:16] statement teaching is a little bit
[9:18] treacherous getting out on thin ice
[9:20] and you can say well you know be careful
[9:21] we don't want too much teaching and
[9:23] but you can never have faith
[9:26] until you positionally know what you are
[9:29] and you can't know that without teaching
[9:32] amen so so don't be afraid of teaching
[9:35] the teaching is a posi
[9:36] the teaching is intended to bring a
[9:38] positional placing and that positional
[9:40] placing will bring the right kind of
[9:42] faith amen
[9:43] and we always need preaching we always
[9:45] need evangelism we always need
[9:47] teaching we always need all of these all
[9:49] these guests saying this and no why
[9:51] diminishes any other gift because we
[9:53] still need
[9:54] amen we still need conviction sometimes
[9:57] we still need somebody to preach in such
[9:59] a way that'll shake us out of lethargy
[10:01] or
[10:02] awaken us to a a you know to to a
[10:05] condition in our lives that we're
[10:06] allowing
[10:07] we still need to glean what's in the
[10:09] field we still need our children to come
[10:11] to the lord
[10:12] we still need the visitors amen we still
[10:14] need those among us
[10:15] that haven't had that experience to come
[10:17] to that experience
[10:18] but when we come to that experience with
[10:20] the lord amen and
[10:22] in the body of christ then we need to
[10:24] come under teaching which will give us
[10:26] understanding and that understanding
[10:28] will place us positionally in christ
[10:30] which will give us the right kind of
[10:32] faith
[10:33] so so don't ever be afraid if anybody
[10:36] ever uses that quote like that
[10:38] say yeah it's treacherous but you can't
[10:39] have the right kind of faith without it
[10:42] it stretches but you'll never come into
[10:44] position without it
[10:45] amen because it was the teaching of the
[10:47] word that brought us into our position
[10:50] let's go to the book of ephesians
[10:52] together
[10:53] and look at ephesians chapter one
[11:02] ephesians chapter 1 verse 3.
[11:10] see the one of the reasons i want to go
[11:14] into this is just the way the lord's
[11:15] been leading
[11:16] of course but also
[11:19] god didn't save us to have a trophy
[11:23] god didn't save us i mean just for an
[11:26] accomplishment he didn't put us on this
[11:28] earth he didn't call us to himself
[11:29] he didn't awaken us to the reality of
[11:31] the message just you know to check off
[11:33] an accomplishment box or for
[11:35] us to have a merit badge or a
[11:37] certificate or an award
[11:40] but it all is for a purpose amen
[11:42] everything that god's doing is for a
[11:43] purpose amen he put us here in this age
[11:45] for a purpose
[11:46] he called us at a specific time for a
[11:48] purpose we had an
[11:50] ability of faith within us to respond at
[11:52] a certain given time
[11:54] it may not have been the first time you
[11:56] heard preaching it may not have been
[11:57] amen you might have been raised in the
[12:00] truth and
[12:00] you know so much of it was going over
[12:02] your head for so long but there was an
[12:03] appointed time
[12:05] and at a point in time it meant
[12:06] something quickened on the inside and
[12:08] you had an ability to receive
[12:10] amen what was being preached god god put
[12:12] you here for that time god called you in
[12:14] that time you responded in your time
[12:16] amen because god has a purpose in doing
[12:18] it not just saying i did it but there's
[12:20] something
[12:21] else he wants to accomplish in your
[12:23] calling amen and calling you to himself
[12:25] in your being here on earth
[12:26] with the faith to believe amen that's
[12:29] just the starting point
[12:31] but he wants to now finish his his work
[12:35] and he in order to finish his work upon
[12:37] this earth he's
[12:38] got to have a body to work through and
[12:39] that body is the members of the body of
[12:41] christ that's on earth at this time
[12:43] to finish the work that christ did not
[12:45] finish in his first
[12:46] earthly ministry so we have to be
[12:49] positionally placed we have to know
[12:51] what we are we have to be taught these
[12:53] things so that we can begin to move
[12:55] amen and the things god called us to
[12:56] move in with confidence
[12:59] all right ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be
[13:02] the god and father of our lord jesus
[13:04] christ who hath blessed us with all
[13:05] spiritual blessings
[13:07] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[13:10] according as he hath chosen us in him
[13:12] before the foundation of the world
[13:14] that we should be holy and without blame
[13:17] before him in love
[13:18] so god has already predetermined
[13:22] he's already predetermined uh
[13:25] what we're going to be he has already
[13:26] chosen us in christ before the
[13:29] foundation of the world
[13:30] that we should be holy and without blame
[13:32] before him in love
[13:33] that is god's desire not ours
[13:38] god chose us in him so that we could be
[13:40] holy
[13:42] and without blame before him in love god
[13:45] wants us blameless
[13:47] it doesn't matter how much we want to be
[13:49] blameless it was god's design god chose
[13:51] us in christ
[13:52] christ would die for us because he
[13:54] wanted us holy and without blame before
[13:55] him in love
[13:57] it was all his purpose amen no matter
[13:59] how many tears that you shed
[14:01] in repentance and how what a longing
[14:03] that you had
[14:04] amen to come to the lord no matter how
[14:06] strong that was in you it was only a
[14:08] reflection of the strong desire god had
[14:10] before
[14:11] god had the desire first and god had the
[14:13] desire stronger and it was reflected
[14:16] back in us in in our desire to be one
[14:18] with him
[14:20] verse 5 having predestinated us
[14:25] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[14:27] christ to himself
[14:28] according according to the pleasure of
[14:31] his the good pleasure of his will
[14:33] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[14:36] wherein he hath made us
[14:37] accepted in the beloved so in this in
[14:40] this passage there's nothing yet that
[14:42] we've done
[14:43] there's nothing yet that he's asked us
[14:45] to do there's nothing yet that was
[14:46] required
[14:47] for us to have this grace and have this
[14:50] love
[14:50] and to be blameless before him in love
[14:52] and it was all by his will by his desire
[14:55] amen to glorify his grace it's all for
[14:58] him
[14:58] it's all what he chose to do but but
[15:01] verse 5 he said having predestinated us
[15:03] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[15:05] christ to himself
[15:06] according to the good pleasure of his
[15:08] will i want to look at that word
[15:10] adoption
[15:11] of children because if you go through
[15:13] the strongest concordance
[15:14] and you go to adoption of children it's
[15:16] very much what brother branham's already
[15:17] taught us and explained to us but i just
[15:19] want to take some time with him
[15:20] in this in this word adoption of
[15:22] children that's one word
[15:24] in the greek that they've made adoption
[15:26] of children as the translation
[15:29] and when you go into the uh uh the
[15:32] concordance
[15:33] it says from a presumed compound of
[15:36] word number 5207 and a derivative of
[15:39] 5087. so basically what they're saying
[15:41] is
[15:42] that's a compound of these two words put
[15:44] together
[15:45] is what this word now is and this word
[15:48] is translated
[15:49] adoption adoption of children adoption
[15:51] of sons
[15:52] that's how it's translated but if we go
[15:54] look at those other two words that this
[15:56] word is a compound of
[15:57] the first one just means sun or
[16:00] offspring
[16:01] it just is a sun but the second one
[16:05] means to lay put make
[16:08] a point it means to set
[16:11] to put to place so now when we look at
[16:15] adoption of sons
[16:16] adoption of sons is not you know like we
[16:19] understand adoption to be and brother
[16:21] branham explain this thoroughly
[16:23] it's not like you know when we see a
[16:25] poor little child that doesn't have a
[16:26] home and needs a home and we're moved in
[16:28] our heart
[16:29] and we want to adopt that child into our
[16:31] family that's what we understand
[16:33] in our english term of adoption that's
[16:35] what we understand adoption
[16:36] but that's not what this word adoption
[16:38] means adoption is
[16:40] you already have a son this is already a
[16:42] sun to begin with
[16:43] it's not becoming a son it is a son it
[16:46] is an
[16:47] offspring it is the one from the father
[16:49] but that one has to now be
[16:51] set or put or placed so we've been
[16:55] ordained we've been predestinated to the
[16:58] adoption
[16:58] of children by jesus christ we weren't
[17:01] just we weren't just
[17:02] predestinated to be picked up out of the
[17:04] marty clay and saved and set on a shelf
[17:07] but we were predestinated to be picked
[17:09] up amen to be washed off
[17:11] but to be put in service to be filled
[17:13] and to be used by god
[17:15] so when we look at our predestination
[17:17] our predestination is not
[17:18] he just he knew i was going to be lost
[17:20] and he made a way that i wouldn't be
[17:22] lost
[17:22] it was more than that friends it wasn't
[17:24] just to not be lost but it was now
[17:26] to become the vessel that he's going to
[17:28] use he's going to put you
[17:30] in position put you in place as a son
[17:33] not take you from non-sun to sun you
[17:35] were not acting like a son
[17:36] but you were always were a son amen you
[17:39] may not have been acting like a wheat
[17:40] but down
[17:41] inside of you was wheat life amen but
[17:43] you were acting and displaying
[17:44] cockleburn
[17:46] but if there was no wheat life in there
[17:47] there was nothing no life to quicken
[17:49] there had to be a
[17:50] you had to be a son or daughter of god
[17:51] to begin with
[17:53] or else you'll never come to any
[17:54] position or any placing
[17:57] so he's taking a son this adoption of
[17:59] children is taking a son that's already
[18:01] a son
[18:02] and putting it into a position or
[18:04] putting it into a place
[18:07] those are things common in the message
[18:09] we understand that
[18:10] amen but i want to take my time and just
[18:13] look at that so we understand why
[18:14] brother benham said what he said and
[18:16] what the scriptures are saying and what
[18:17] these words mean
[18:19] so so i must in order to fulfill my
[18:23] purpose in this life
[18:25] i must move beyond just the joy and
[18:28] satisfaction that i've been chosen
[18:32] because that's a wonderful thing that's
[18:33] a wonderful revelation and realization
[18:35] that before the foundation the word he
[18:37] chose me
[18:38] that i was wayward i was lost i was
[18:40] undone
[18:41] i had spiritual amnesia i was going the
[18:44] wrong direction but he came and
[18:45] interrupted my plan
[18:47] with his plan and he opened my eyes so
[18:49] that i could see that i'm a son
[18:51] amen in in in any uh and he baptized me
[18:54] with the holy ghost gave me a new birth
[18:56] experience to recognize
[18:57] that the seed has come to life that's a
[19:00] wonderful thing
[19:01] but we can't stop there because we've
[19:03] been predestinated
[19:05] unto the placing of sons in jesus christ
[19:08] so there's more there's more than just
[19:11] that realization
[19:12] there's the actual work that he's called
[19:14] us to do
[19:16] if we look at galatians let's go to
[19:17] galatians chapter 4.
[19:27] in verse 1
[19:34] now i say that the heir as long as he is
[19:36] a child different nothing from a servant
[19:38] though he be lord of all but as under
[19:41] tutors and governors until the time
[19:42] appointed to the father
[19:44] even so when we were children we were in
[19:46] bondage other than the elements of the
[19:48] world
[19:48] so even when we were in bondage under
[19:51] the elements of the world you were still
[19:52] a child of god
[19:54] we were just stuck in that condition but
[19:56] we were still a child of god
[19:58] amen but when the fullness of the time
[20:00] was come god sent forth his son made of
[20:02] a woman made under the law
[20:04] to redeem them that were under the law
[20:06] that we might receive
[20:08] the adoption of sons now this adoption
[20:11] of sons is the same exact term that we
[20:13] just went through
[20:15] and because you are sons god has sent
[20:17] forth the spirit of his son into your
[20:19] heart
[20:19] crying abba father so what is the spirit
[20:22] i mean what is the
[20:23] what is the spirit of his son it's the
[20:26] holy ghost
[20:27] why does the holy ghost come because
[20:28] you're a son
[20:30] because you're a son he sent the spirit
[20:33] of his son
[20:34] into your heart to where you could cry
[20:35] abba father amen why
[20:37] why did that happen because you were
[20:39] already a son
[20:42] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[20:44] a son
[20:45] and if a son than an heir of god through
[20:48] christ
[20:49] so he he's actually even showing amen
[20:52] through the old testament
[20:53] that that the children of israel were
[20:55] called servants they meant they were
[20:56] being brought up under the tutors of the
[20:57] law
[20:58] amen but god's desire amen was to
[21:00] positionally placed them
[21:01] in christ and when christ come they
[21:03] rejected christ
[21:04] amen and now they never they never got
[21:07] placed in christ jesus
[21:09] but now that opportunity has come for
[21:11] the bride
[21:12] amen so now we were we were under the
[21:14] elements of the world we were lost in
[21:16] darkness but we were
[21:17] sons and because we were sons he sent
[21:20] unto us the spirit of his son you
[21:23] realize
[21:23] he didn't uh if i could just take my
[21:26] time and explain it
[21:28] the best way that i know how it wasn't
[21:31] my agonizing for hours
[21:35] that brought the spirit of the sun now i
[21:38] may have had the experience of agonizing
[21:40] because i needed to go through that in
[21:41] repentance
[21:43] you understand that but it wasn't that i
[21:45] had finally earned something from god
[21:47] because i had finally proved to him
[21:50] that i was a son because i'm really
[21:52] laboring here in prayer
[21:53] and god looked down on me with mercy and
[21:56] said oh he's really laboring in prayer
[21:57] i'll go ahead and give him the holy
[21:59] ghost
[22:00] no because you were sons he sent the
[22:02] spirit of his son
[22:03] to where you can cry abba father my
[22:05] father
[22:07] so we go through the travailing for us
[22:09] those are necessary things
[22:11] the weeping and the travailing and the
[22:12] repenting are necessary for
[22:14] us amen to mourn over our sins to mourn
[22:17] over our conditions
[22:18] amen but it's not it's not the length or
[22:20] the amount of agony or the intensity
[22:23] by which we agonize that moves god amen
[22:26] to fill us with the spirit
[22:27] he's already moved before the foundation
[22:29] of the world because we're sons
[22:31] and if you're a son he sends the spirit
[22:33] of his son into your heart where you cry
[22:36] abba father
[22:37] so there is no earning this
[22:40] this is something that's given to sons
[22:43] now that's a know why
[22:44] uh taking away from the agony of
[22:46] repentance because brother branham he
[22:48] even said i doubt a dry eyed confession
[22:50] why because when we come to the
[22:52] realization and impact of this it should
[22:54] have impact in our lives
[22:55] there should be a real repentance and a
[22:57] real sorrow for sin
[22:58] and a real crying out to god and a real
[23:01] desperation to be saved
[23:03] those things should be there but we
[23:05] don't want to get the wrong idea
[23:07] of what's happening there's always our
[23:09] perspective
[23:10] in god's perspective we want to keep
[23:13] these things right in our minds
[23:15] that's why we come to teaching so that
[23:18] we can have the right kind of faith
[23:22] you know if we don't come without
[23:25] teaching if we don't ever slow down and
[23:27] just go through what brother branham
[23:28] went through
[23:29] then we can get into these cycles of you
[23:32] know
[23:33] uh i must not have prayed long enough or
[23:35] i must not have repented enough
[23:38] and i and you might think that's
[23:40] nonsense but i hear it all the time
[23:42] and then people are you know i i just
[23:45] don't know that i
[23:46] i completely repented of everything i
[23:48] want to go back through the whole
[23:49] process again
[23:51] i want to go back through the process
[23:53] again and then those are the
[23:55] that's the way we live life in the
[23:56] pentecostal denomination we were always
[23:58] going through the process again
[24:00] and every time we failed god and every
[24:02] time we let down the word we went
[24:04] back and questioned our sonship and we
[24:06] had to go back and reestablish our
[24:08] sonship
[24:09] amen and then start from zero again
[24:13] you know and that see see without the
[24:15] right kind of teaching
[24:17] and then if we just give just repentance
[24:19] preaching
[24:20] amen then you get people who are born
[24:22] again repenting and trying to get born
[24:24] again again
[24:24] and how do you get born again again
[24:28] all right and those who are already born
[24:30] again they may have to come back to
[24:32] repentance because
[24:33] there's a place in the word that they've
[24:34] let down the bar and they may have to
[24:36] they have to on may have to uh repent
[24:38] and repent of that
[24:39] and be sorrowful for and ask god to
[24:41] forgive them for and wash that out but
[24:43] that's not getting born again again
[24:45] once that seed comes to life it comes to
[24:46] life once it's quickened by the spirit
[24:48] it's quickened by the spirit
[24:49] how are you going to quicken it by the
[24:51] spirit again once it's quickened by the
[24:53] spirit of god how is it going to die
[24:56] how is it going to go back into a
[24:57] dormant state you see
[24:59] that we have to understand that i've
[25:01] come to the realization of who i am
[25:03] by the grace of god he's given me a
[25:05] revelation and he's given me a faith to
[25:07] believe
[25:08] that didn't come from my labors it
[25:09] didn't come from my hours in prayer it
[25:11] didn't come from my own effort or my own
[25:13] love it was his love
[25:14] in my heart projecting back to him what
[25:16] was already there
[25:18] and if i've come to that then i realized
[25:21] i'm a son
[25:22] i'm a son i'm a daughter of god amen if
[25:25] i
[25:25] fail god i'm still a son or daughter of
[25:28] god that failed god
[25:31] i've still been birthed amen i still
[25:33] been birthed by the spirit of god amen
[25:35] by the baptism of the holy ghost and i'm
[25:37] not going to go back
[25:39] amen and take that away and readdress
[25:41] that again
[25:42] i'm just going to say god i'm your son
[25:45] amen you've birthed me into
[25:46] into your body but i failed you
[25:49] and i'm repenting for my failure but i'm
[25:52] not doubting my sonship
[25:56] you see if we you know we're going to
[25:59] fail
[26:01] i mean if you haven't failed this week
[26:05] then my goodness i want to spend some
[26:07] time with you and learn
[26:09] what you've got and i want it to rub off
[26:11] on me we're going to fail
[26:13] but without the right understanding the
[26:15] right teaching every time we fail
[26:17] we go back to square one and start over
[26:19] again then we never move away from milk
[26:21] we never get into me
[26:22] we never go into positional placing we
[26:24] never get to where we're useful for the
[26:26] body
[26:26] because we never have confidence in who
[26:28] we are
[26:30] always doubting always wondering want to
[26:32] get baptized again want to go to the
[26:34] altar again want to pray through again
[26:37] but god god wants more than just you to
[26:40] recognize you're a son
[26:42] he wants you to get in a position a work
[26:44] that he had before the foundation in the
[26:45] world
[26:46] something that needs to be accomplished
[26:47] in this day and only you you're the only
[26:49] vessel that can do it there's no other
[26:51] vessel that's
[26:51] ordained you're not here by a waste of
[26:53] flesh you're not here by an accident
[26:55] you're not here by the passions of mom
[26:57] and dad
[26:58] if you're a son or daughter of god
[26:59] you're here for a specific reason
[27:01] for a specific purpose for a specific
[27:04] work in this time that you're in and as
[27:06] long as we keep going around the doubt
[27:08] and confusion of whether i'm born again
[27:09] or not
[27:12] then we never get to a place where we're
[27:14] useful for the kingdom of god
[27:16] we're always wondering we're always
[27:18] doubting we're always
[27:22] i say god this is this is the time for
[27:25] action this is the time for
[27:26] manifestation this is time for the life
[27:28] of christ
[27:28] on displaying the bride this isn't time
[27:30] for the bride to be beat over with a
[27:32] denominational stick and be getting
[27:34] knocked down to the ground again
[27:35] because she's not good enough she must
[27:37] not be saved
[27:40] i'm saved by the grace of god i'm a
[27:42] child of god by forward nation
[27:44] amen by predestination amen i i can't
[27:47] help it that's who i
[27:48] am i may not be doing a good job at it
[27:52] but that's who i still
[27:53] am i may be failing but i still who i
[27:56] am how do you know brother jeff by faith
[27:59] i know it
[28:00] i know he's awakened something in me
[28:02] that i didn't awaken
[28:03] there's something there that recognizes
[28:05] that who he is and i can't help it i
[28:07] just see it
[28:09] so i may not be doing a very good job i
[28:11] mean my report card might be
[28:13] embarrassing
[28:14] but i can't change who i am
[28:18] and if i realize if i can get
[28:19] positionally placed in what i
[28:21] am in christ amen then i can move past
[28:24] all the doubts and fears of whether i'm
[28:26] a child or not and finally start walking
[28:28] in the calling wherewith he's called me
[28:30] the purpose that he has for my life
[28:33] now in adoption the same message we just
[28:35] read a quote before
[28:37] we want to read here but in genesis 2
[28:40] when he made man he said i am i am
[28:43] jehovah
[28:44] yahweh jehovah what did he mean i am the
[28:48] all-existing one
[28:49] who has created something off of myself
[28:51] to be a son of mine
[28:53] or a temporary or an amateur little one
[28:55] of mine
[28:57] oh glory now i want to i want to pay
[29:00] attention to this
[29:02] i'm going to read through it again
[29:03] slowly but i want to back up for a
[29:05] minute and i want to make a qualifying
[29:06] statement
[29:08] when i make statements like i'm making
[29:09] today about teaching and placing and
[29:12] being born again
[29:13] i'm in no way diminishing the role of an
[29:16] evangelist
[29:17] i hope you understand me or even of a
[29:20] camp meeting for use
[29:22] i'm not diminishing that or taking away
[29:24] from that those things have their place
[29:25] and they're necessary
[29:26] because until you come under the
[29:28] conviction of the holy ghost and repent
[29:30] you're never going to move forward in
[29:31] the plan of god
[29:33] and also i understand too beyond any
[29:36] shadow of a doubt
[29:38] that not every gift is placed into one
[29:40] manner one ministry or one group of
[29:42] people
[29:44] there's specialists out there who
[29:45] specialize in things
[29:47] and no no pastor has it all and there's
[29:50] times that you just need
[29:51] an evangelist to come through because
[29:53] because there's kids who are born here
[29:55] who need to come up and come under the
[29:56] conviction the power of the holy ghost
[29:58] and they need they need to realize i'm
[30:00] lost and need to be saved
[30:03] and you know if that if that's if that's
[30:06] just not the way god's wired us and not
[30:09] each person has that gift
[30:10] then we have to bring those gifts
[30:12] through
[30:13] you understand that and there's nothing
[30:16] against it we work in harmony with one
[30:18] another
[30:19] there still needs to be a camp amen
[30:21] that's going to preach to children
[30:23] who have grown up in a message and never
[30:24] realized they're lost
[30:27] somebody needs to tell them unless
[30:28] you've had an experience of change
[30:30] you're lost and need to be saved
[30:32] cry out unto the lord so we don't ever
[30:35] want to get just because
[30:37] just because we'll just bring it right
[30:38] home just because in this church we have
[30:40] a certain style of ministry because of
[30:42] who the pastor is
[30:43] i can't change that i can't help that
[30:46] but if we ever if we ever make that the
[30:49] measuring stick and anything outside of
[30:50] that is wrong we've missed the whole
[30:52] plan of god
[30:54] we've got to be very very careful that
[30:56] we never just get one leaning one way
[30:58] because we're going to get out of
[31:00] balance very quickly
[31:02] and realize we're off in the weeds
[31:03] because we've refused other ministries
[31:05] that we have need of
[31:06] [Applause]
[31:09] amen even even old-timers
[31:12] believe the word serving god with all
[31:14] their hearts every once in a while they
[31:16] need to be handled a little bit roughly
[31:17] and be
[31:18] sheared and
[31:21] we can't expect one minister to do it
[31:24] all
[31:26] you know he does the convicting he does
[31:28] the shearing he does the teaching he
[31:30] does the family stuff
[31:32] we got to have it all you know it's like
[31:36] when brother aaron came through sunday
[31:38] brother aaron
[31:39] i mean he at the end the spirit dropped
[31:41] in a way he brought a call to action
[31:43] stand up if you want to do this
[31:44] and we had people responding and i said
[31:47] praise god that's what we need we need
[31:49] to work together
[31:50] we need to have these things amen one
[31:53] plants
[31:53] one waters god gets the increase
[31:56] that's why every ministry in this church
[31:58] doesn't have to be a replica
[32:00] of the pastors what's the point
[32:04] if every ministry of all our ministering
[32:05] brothers is a replica of the pastor and
[32:07] please don't ever feel that kind of
[32:08] pressure
[32:09] to be a replica i am what i am by the
[32:11] grace of god i can no more help it than
[32:13] you can help it
[32:15] i've tried to change style of preaching
[32:16] before and didn't work so good for me
[32:20] because i like i hear stuff and i like
[32:22] it you know i hear other preachers i'm
[32:24] like i
[32:24] like the way he preaches it doesn't work
[32:28] for me i think i told you my testimony
[32:31] when
[32:31] brother diggs the first time brother
[32:33] diggs was preaching i mean he used the
[32:35] whole platform
[32:36] the whole floor everything and i had
[32:39] just started preaching i mean i had
[32:40] maybe preached a couple times
[32:42] and i'd gotten to the i'd come up and i
[32:44] don't think i've ever
[32:45] went from this corner to this corner
[32:47] outside of that
[32:49] and he's over here hammering on top of
[32:51] this post and
[32:52] and he's running all over the floor and
[32:54] i liked it i liked that freedom i liked
[32:57] that
[32:57] life i liked that so i i told myself
[33:00] next time i preach i'm going to go over
[33:01] and touch that post
[33:05] i'm going to do it right now just to
[33:06] prove i can
[33:10] and i come to the next service and
[33:12] priest and i never moved from this
[33:13] corner to that corner
[33:16] you can't help what you are don't try to
[33:19] change don't try to mimic don't try to
[33:21] copy
[33:21] and certainly don't put down something
[33:24] that's different
[33:28] i mean of course if we had evangelism
[33:32] every sunday and every wednesday we
[33:34] would be off balance in another way
[33:37] but you can get off the road on the
[33:38] right and left side as much as you can
[33:40] on the right side
[33:42] so we got to make sure that we we accept
[33:45] the gifts we
[33:45] accept what god has said amen when
[33:48] somebody comes in and preaches a fiery
[33:50] sermon and really gets down in our
[33:52] business
[33:53] amen we say thank god i needed that
[33:55] today
[33:56] when somebody comes and starts to to
[33:58] preach a higher level of revelation from
[34:00] a word we've never seen before
[34:01] and begins to break it down and tie it
[34:03] together from genesis to revelation when
[34:05] he's saying thank god
[34:06] that's what i needed today
[34:09] and get away from saying well i wish we
[34:11] had this i wish we had that
[34:12] just take what god gives and let it mold
[34:14] our character and mold us into what he
[34:15] wants us to be
[34:17] so we have to know who we are i mean
[34:20] it's great when we finally see mature
[34:22] christians when they get to a place
[34:23] where they can relax in who they are
[34:25] don't have to pretend don't have to put
[34:27] on don't apologize for the way they are
[34:29] don't have to apologize for the way they
[34:30] minister we don't have to apologize for
[34:32] the way
[34:32] that god has made them the way they
[34:34] handle the word the way they
[34:36] talk about the word the way they handle
[34:37] situations
[34:39] but we all need each other everybody
[34:42] needs everybody
[34:43] everybody in the body needs every other
[34:45] part of the body
[34:46] and so we don't we don't ever want to
[34:48] get in the wrong frame of mind
[34:51] so when i make these statements i you
[34:53] you guys know me you know my heart
[34:54] but i want to share and be clear we're
[34:56] not diminishing anything else
[34:58] or any other style and and i've heard
[35:01] comments before
[35:02] you know they'll talk about another
[35:04] pastor with that pastor he's really not
[35:06] a pastor he's really an evangelist
[35:07] don't you ever say that don't you ever
[35:10] ever ever ever ever say that if god put
[35:14] him there
[35:14] then he is exactly what those people
[35:16] there need
[35:19] now that that may not work for you god
[35:21] didn't put you there
[35:22] so you can look at that and say well i
[35:23] don't think i could sit under that
[35:25] ministry
[35:25] well god didn't put you under that
[35:28] ministry
[35:30] so be happy but don't tear somebody down
[35:34] just because you couldn't sit under that
[35:35] ministry
[35:36] amen that's god's ministry to god's
[35:39] sheep
[35:40] and he designed one to match the other
[35:43] they're complementary the congregation
[35:44] and the pastor are complementary to one
[35:46] another
[35:47] let it be just be thankful god's put you
[35:49] where he's put you
[35:51] but but don't ever say he's really
[35:53] advanced he's not don't say that if god
[35:55] made him a pastor he's a pastor
[35:57] if he's in the wrong position let god
[35:58] move him that's don't you determine what
[36:00] he is and
[36:01] is not praise god
[36:05] i won't plan on saying that but i'm glad
[36:06] i did
[36:08] we just have to love one another and let
[36:10] god be in charge
[36:12] let god be gone now i want to get into
[36:15] this adoption
[36:16] back to this quote it says but in
[36:18] genesis 2
[36:20] he's talking about the creation of man
[36:22] when he made man
[36:23] he said i am and he says all the way
[36:26] back he says
[36:27] lord god let's go into genesis and just
[36:29] look at this together
[36:32] aaron mentioned this on sunday
[36:40] and uh i wrote it down i really enjoyed
[36:43] it
[36:43] and i want to review this because of
[36:45] this quote
[36:47] genesis 1 it says in the beginning god
[36:49] created the heaven and the earth
[36:51] and brother venom talks about this right
[36:53] out of um
[36:54] right about right out of the school
[36:55] field bible in genesis 1 1 he even uses
[36:58] some of the languages in the notes here
[36:59] in the scofield bible
[37:01] but in the beginning god amen it's
[37:02] elohim or
[37:04] el or ella and brother brennam all the
[37:05] time will say el ella elohim
[37:08] el ella elohim and he said these are
[37:10] these are just three ways of saying the
[37:12] same thing
[37:13] but it's it's this exactly what aaron
[37:15] mentioned it's a compound meaning
[37:17] of two words meaning the strong one and
[37:20] also one who's bound by an oath
[37:22] so there's a strong one who's bound by
[37:24] an oath it's god
[37:25] who bound himself by his own word
[37:28] but when he gets over to genesis chapter
[37:30] 2
[37:32] genesis chapter 2.
[37:36] verse 4 these are the generations of
[37:38] heaven and earth
[37:40] when when they were created in the day
[37:42] that the lord god made the earth and the
[37:44] heavens
[37:45] so they're using a new term now in
[37:47] genesis 2 as lord god
[37:48] and after he makes man now there's an
[37:51] expression of lord god
[37:52] amen which is jehovah elohim
[37:56] so this this is also a compound it's the
[37:59] self-existing one we hear brother brahm
[38:00] say that all
[38:01] all the time he's a self-existing one
[38:03] but but there's also a
[38:05] part of this word jehovah comes from the
[38:08] word hava
[38:09] which means to to become
[38:13] to become to become known amen or
[38:16] becoming
[38:17] so that's why aaron said there's a
[38:19] compound meaning he didn't break it down
[38:21] but he says
[38:22] it's a compound the self-existent one
[38:24] who's becoming
[38:25] or to become so now when
[38:28] when he's god and when he when he's in
[38:30] the beginning god
[38:32] he's elohim he's the strong one
[38:35] amen who's bound by his word but now
[38:38] when he begins the rate to
[38:39] relate to humanity he makes man now he
[38:42] is
[38:43] uh lord god he's jehovah elohim he's
[38:45] jehovah
[38:46] the self-existing one who's becoming
[38:49] amen and that's why brother branham says
[38:51] who's revealing himself
[38:53] he uses that term revealing himself
[38:54] because as he's becoming
[38:57] what does he mean by becoming i mean
[38:59] it's not that he wasn't amen but
[39:00] whatever he was he's becoming manifest
[39:02] in this dispensation
[39:04] and as he's becoming he's revealing
[39:07] himself
[39:08] so it's the self-existent one who
[39:10] reveals himself how does he reveal
[39:11] himself
[39:12] by becoming do we understand that
[39:16] so it's not that it's a self-existent
[39:18] one who reveals himself by staying in
[39:19] heaven
[39:20] and spurting out words to reveal himself
[39:22] no
[39:23] in this in this self-revelation of the
[39:25] self-existing one
[39:26] he becomes the word and as he becomes
[39:30] the word
[39:30] he reveals himself oh praise be to god
[39:35] that's why you're the revelation of the
[39:38] word
[39:39] it's him becoming that's what aaron was
[39:41] talking about on sunday
[39:43] it's the same thing so when brother
[39:44] branham uses these terms amen
[39:46] he's saying you know uh uh ella elohim
[39:49] jehovah yahweh and he's mixing them all
[39:52] up but he keeps going back to the
[39:53] self-existing one
[39:54] who reveals himself or the self-existing
[39:56] one who's revealing himself but when you
[39:58] really go back to it that revelation
[40:01] is a becoming because god wanted to
[40:04] become
[40:05] tangible it's god
[40:08] becoming tangible is jehovah
[40:11] the self-existing one who's becoming and
[40:14] that becoming
[40:15] is him revealing himself
[40:19] praise god that's why creation was a
[40:22] revelation
[40:24] that's why the creation of man was a
[40:26] great revelation
[40:28] it was jehovah it was the self-existing
[40:30] one revealing himself when he made man
[40:33] and when he made man male and female it
[40:35] was a self-existing one revealing
[40:37] himself male and female
[40:41] so it says in genesis we'll read this
[40:43] quote again genesis 2
[40:44] when he made man jehovah yahweh
[40:48] jehovah what did it mean i'm the
[40:50] self-existing one
[40:51] one who has created something off of
[40:53] myself to be a son of mine
[40:55] or a temporary or an amateur little one
[40:57] of mine o glory what
[40:59] jehovah means that he gave man to be
[41:02] listen he said jehovah
[41:04] means that god that he gave man to be an
[41:06] amateur god
[41:07] because he is father god and he made man
[41:09] an amateur god
[41:10] so he isn't self-existing anymore he
[41:12] exists with his family
[41:15] what is that the self-existing one who
[41:18] reveals himself
[41:19] how in the creation of man the man and
[41:22] his wife
[41:22] putting them together in the garden that
[41:24] was that that was jehovah
[41:28] that was the word made manifest it was
[41:30] the word made flesh he
[41:31] is the word it was the strong one bound
[41:33] by a nose who's self-existing who's now
[41:35] revealing himself by what
[41:37] by becoming amen
[41:41] so now he's not alone he exists with his
[41:44] family
[41:44] amen ella elohim now
[41:48] now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the
[41:50] one who exists
[41:52] the one who exists with his family
[41:56] brother ram says that is now jehovah
[41:59] jehovah meaning the one who exists with
[42:01] this family
[42:02] you can't find that if you're looking
[42:04] for that exact phrase in
[42:06] any bible translation that you ever find
[42:08] but it's exactly what is happening
[42:11] when job is revealing himself he's
[42:12] becoming he's becoming one he's becoming
[42:14] tangible how does he become
[42:16] tangible as he comes family by family
[42:19] attribute by attribute family member by
[42:21] family member
[42:21] he is becoming tangible he's becoming
[42:24] visible he's becoming
[42:26] known in his attributes
[42:29] so what is jehovah brother man's the
[42:31] definition
[42:33] the one who exists with his family what
[42:35] is that family
[42:37] it's him revealing himself what is
[42:40] family
[42:40] the family is the revelation of him it
[42:44] is god becoming
[42:47] are you in the family that makes you
[42:50] part of jehovah automatically
[42:54] now god made man to be predominant over
[42:56] the earth
[42:57] he had dominion and the earth was man's
[42:59] dominion is that is that scripture
[43:01] then if that's his domain he was god
[43:03] over the earth he could speak and it
[43:05] would be so
[43:06] he could speak this and it would be so
[43:08] oh there he is god jehovah the one
[43:10] who once existed in self-existence now
[43:13] exists with his family
[43:15] and his little ones with him there you
[43:17] are
[43:19] that's jehovah where's jehovah at now
[43:24] jesus christ in a many men are by he's
[43:26] still becoming
[43:28] what becoming tangible to becoming
[43:31] known he's becoming known now
[43:34] as a bride he was known as a church but
[43:37] now he's being known
[43:38] as a bride what is it it's a further
[43:41] expression
[43:42] of jehovah
[43:46] so that's why we when we take these
[43:48] terms
[43:49] uh you know there's a denominational
[43:53] understanding
[43:54] of the great jehovah and that the great
[43:57] jehovah puts him over here or puts him
[43:59] in this place and puts him in that place
[44:01] but the great jehovah now exists with
[44:03] his family
[44:04] the self-existing one who's becoming one
[44:07] who's becoming tangible
[44:08] how is he becoming tangible he's
[44:10] becoming tangible through his family
[44:12] what is his family his attributes what
[44:14] are his attributes his thoughts from
[44:16] before the foundation of the world that
[44:17] have come down into flesh
[44:19] and been born again by the baptism in
[44:20] the holy ghost now manifesting his life
[44:22] what is that jehovah on display
[44:25] that's the self-existing one dwelling
[44:27] with his family
[44:30] we're part of that expression it's not
[44:32] god over there it's not god there it's
[44:34] not someday god
[44:35] and one day god it's god here now
[44:38] expressed in his family
[44:40] it's god in me it's god in you that's
[44:42] why you can't disrespect me and i can't
[44:44] disrespect you
[44:45] because it's the self-existing one amen
[44:48] with his family
[44:49] what is it in you it's the self-existing
[44:51] one becoming is the self-existing one
[44:53] revealing himself
[44:54] in you amen and i can't disrespect that
[44:57] and you can't disrespect it in me
[45:00] if i disrespect it in you i've
[45:02] disrespected jehovah
[45:04] because it's jehovah the self-existent
[45:06] one becoming
[45:07] whatever portion you were meant to play
[45:09] whatever part that you have in the body
[45:11] amen nobody else can take it it's your
[45:13] part and if i disrespect that or
[45:15] disregard that
[45:16] i have rejected jehovah
[45:20] now you see why we have to be careful
[45:21] how we speak about one another
[45:24] how we treat one another even in error
[45:26] even in
[45:27] wrong even in mistakes we've got to be
[45:29] very careful how we treat the bride of
[45:31] jesus christ
[45:32] how we treat one another amen because
[45:34] because you cannot reject
[45:36] jehovah see
[45:39] sometimes we want to determine because
[45:42] this brother doesn't agree with me or he
[45:44] doesn't have this doctrinal position or
[45:46] or this or that i want to make him
[45:48] outside of christ
[45:50] but if i take an expression of christ
[45:53] and i myself call him antichrist i have
[45:55] become antichrist
[45:58] because i'm against the word because
[46:00] what is that
[46:01] that's a positional place son or
[46:03] daughter of god that is the word on
[46:04] display
[46:05] i have now rejected the word
[46:09] sometimes it's better just put your hand
[46:11] over your mouth
[46:15] you remember uh you remember when they
[46:17] were disputing over the body of moses
[46:20] michael the archangel i mean michael
[46:23] he did not even bring a railing
[46:25] accusation when contending with satan
[46:28] he just said the lord deal with you i'm
[46:30] doing what he told me to do
[46:33] it would be so much better if we would
[46:35] just say
[46:36] god bless you and may the lord may the
[46:37] lord bless you and lead you
[46:39] may the lord deal with you i'm not going
[46:41] to say i'm not going to judge
[46:43] i'm not going to put you in and put you
[46:44] out but there's so
[46:47] there's such a there's such a pride and
[46:50] an arrogancy in human beings
[46:52] amen that if you're against me in any
[46:54] way or contradictory or
[46:55] say something i don't agree with i
[46:57] immediately want to label you with a
[46:59] label that comes from my own will and
[47:01] desire
[47:01] i'm calling you antichrist i'm calling
[47:04] you not in the bride
[47:05] i'm calling you foolish virgin i'm
[47:06] calling you whatever amen and you don't
[47:08] realize that with your very
[47:10] words you you've taken an antichrist
[47:12] spirit and become an expression
[47:13] of antichrist not an expression of
[47:15] christ
[47:18] i said god help us help us we all know
[47:21] what it's like to feel guilty of that
[47:23] we all know what it's like to be quick
[47:25] in judgment quick to speak and
[47:27] say god help us help us you know what
[47:31] that's just another expression that's
[47:34] different than this expression
[47:37] it's like when you get into a
[47:39] relationship with your wife and you get
[47:41] to know one another better
[47:42] you realize she is a different
[47:44] expression than you are
[47:48] like things that you thought were normal
[47:49] all your life this is the right way this
[47:51] is the way everybody thinks about this
[47:55] then you start talking to your wife and
[47:56] she comes from left field with a whole
[47:58] different set of thoughts and you're
[47:59] like
[48:00] you're wrong and she's looking at you
[48:03] like
[48:03] you're wrong but you got
[48:07] but but both are an accurate expression
[48:10] of god according to your makeup
[48:13] i'm not talking about an argument i'm
[48:14] just talking about a viewpoint a way of
[48:16] looking a way of seeing
[48:18] you take circumstances and you analyze
[48:19] it and you come up with two totally
[48:21] different
[48:22] uh modes of operation or two totally
[48:24] different approaches to the same thing
[48:26] what is that it's two expressions of the
[48:28] same thing male and female
[48:31] but if you drive the line too hard and
[48:34] you say well i know this is right
[48:35] because the lord led me there and if
[48:36] you're
[48:37] different than that then you're not of
[48:38] god get thee behind me wife
[48:45] then you're missing another expression
[48:47] amen when god took the two and made them
[48:49] one you're missing another expression of
[48:51] yourself
[48:55] same thing with your brothers and
[48:56] sisters
[48:58] the teacher is one expression of christ
[49:01] the pastor
[49:02] is another the evangelist is another
[49:06] and if we take one and reject the other
[49:07] we become antichrist
[49:11] we when a brother you have brother bam
[49:13] said you look out there
[49:14] all kinds of different types you see
[49:16] some that are real bolsters some are
[49:17] real exuberant you got
[49:18] that peter they're real bold and they're
[49:20] loud you have some that are just
[49:21] he says he says like this you have some
[49:23] that are just real nice
[49:25] [Applause]
[49:28] what was he calling peter i wonder
[49:31] they're just okay you know
[49:34] but that was those were john and peter
[49:37] were both expressions of the nature of
[49:39] christ
[49:40] paul was another expression timothy was
[49:42] a different expression
[49:44] even thomas was a certain expression
[49:48] so this is a god
[49:51] the the self-existing one becoming
[49:54] becoming tangible and we have to be
[49:57] careful
[49:58] and let everybody find their place even
[50:01] the scripture makes it so simple
[50:03] how can the uh how can the eye say to
[50:06] the hand i have no need of thee
[50:08] i may have the wrong words don't condemn
[50:09] me please
[50:11] how can how can this part say to this
[50:13] part i have no need of you
[50:15] but god is so fast in the body that even
[50:17] the uncomely parts we've bestowed more
[50:18] honor on
[50:21] god has even made your human body amen
[50:24] he's made our human body in such a way
[50:26] and put us in a human body so that we
[50:27] could understand the self-existing god
[50:30] who's becoming so that we would
[50:32] understand jehovah amen
[50:33] brother said i want all of my body even
[50:35] the little tip of my finger i want it to
[50:36] stay right there
[50:38] well that should relate to the body of
[50:40] christ
[50:41] i mean you may be one of those
[50:43] boisterous bold ones or you may be one
[50:44] of those that's just nice
[50:47] but they both have to be here they both
[50:50] have to be on display
[50:51] they both have to be expressing
[50:53] something of the nature of god
[50:55] to have a full expression we can't all
[50:57] be the same way
[50:59] so let's let one another find our
[51:01] position get into our place
[51:03] let's encourage one another in our
[51:04] positions and in our places
[51:06] and not try to constantly chip away and
[51:08] mold somebody to be a reflection of our
[51:10] desire
[51:11] but let them be a reflection of jehovah
[51:13] the self-existing one
[51:16] in 1965 the god who is rich in mercy
[51:18] brother brahma says now if you've got
[51:19] eternal life tonight
[51:21] if you have eternal life then we always
[51:23] were because there was only one form of
[51:25] eternal life we always were
[51:27] and the reason we were because we are
[51:29] part of god and god is
[51:30] only god is the only thing that's
[51:33] eternal
[51:35] so if you have eternal life if eternal
[51:36] life is in you
[51:38] then you're part of god it's god in you
[51:43] praise god i don't think we can fully
[51:46] grasp that i know i don't
[51:48] and i don't mind saying that because
[51:49] brother graham says i don't understand
[51:50] it like i should
[51:51] you guys he said you don't understand it
[51:52] like you should because i don't
[51:53] understand it like i should
[51:56] because a part of god is not like if i
[51:58] tear a piece of my bible out and
[52:00] pull off a little corner and give it to
[52:01] you and all you've got is that little
[52:03] piece and you might know what book it is
[52:04] in what chapter and you don't know much
[52:06] but a part of god contains everything
[52:07] that god is
[52:10] all that god is all the wisdom all the
[52:12] knowledge all the knowing all the power
[52:13] all the resources
[52:14] all there same in quality just different
[52:17] in quantity
[52:18] you have a portion but you have a
[52:19] portion with the full dna
[52:21] all of it is there now you may only
[52:24] express
[52:25] a portion of that but it's all there
[52:29] so if we could only grasp that there's a
[52:32] part of god
[52:32] eternal life zoe life god it's on you
[52:35] it's in you it was predestined to be
[52:36] part of you before the foundation of the
[52:38] world it was there
[52:40] if we could just realize that it would
[52:42] change so much
[52:44] i'm begging god to give me a greater
[52:45] revelation than that because where's
[52:47] fear then
[52:48] where's anxiety then amen where where is
[52:51] all of this depression and stuff go
[52:53] when we realize who we are amen god has
[52:56] got to lift us on a higher plane
[52:58] and get above the carnal thinking and
[53:00] break away all the amnesia
[53:01] to realize who we actually are amen
[53:05] to get above some of the things that
[53:06] trouble us so much
[53:09] i'm desiring it for myself i get
[53:11] troubled i get bogged down then i get
[53:13] ashamed of myself because the
[53:14] realization comes
[53:15] of who we are and god's calling and
[53:17] you're like i never should have worried
[53:18] in the first place
[53:21] but he says now continuing on in this
[53:24] same quote he says
[53:25] and like as melchizedek received tithes
[53:28] from abraham
[53:29] and it was allotted to his
[53:30] great-grandson levi who was yet in the
[53:32] loins of abraham paid tithes
[53:33] for he was yet in the loins of abraham
[53:35] when he met melchizedek
[53:37] i want to speak on that over at the
[53:39] other place one morning who is this milk
[53:41] is a day
[53:42] now notice that way back god knew this
[53:44] boy coming down
[53:45] he knowed all things now we are part of
[53:48] god you always was
[53:49] you don't remember it because you were
[53:51] only an attribute in god
[53:52] you were only in his thinking your very
[53:55] name if it ever was on the book of life
[53:57] it was put there before the foundation
[53:58] of the world
[54:00] he knew what you were i'm only saying
[54:02] this not to mix up doctrine but to
[54:04] straighten it out
[54:04] that we might get away from this fear
[54:06] and scare
[54:08] you brother bran's not trying to mix up
[54:10] your doctor and he's trying
[54:11] to straighten doctrine out you were if
[54:13] you're a part of god you've always been
[54:15] a part of god
[54:16] you were with him before there was a
[54:17] molecule before there was dust before
[54:19] there was starlight before there was
[54:21] anything you were a part of god
[54:22] and if all of that would happen to fade
[54:24] away you would still exist
[54:28] you may not exist in this form but you
[54:30] would still exist
[54:31] [Applause]
[54:34] he's trying to straighten this out not
[54:36] twist it up
[54:38] see you're not going to be but now you
[54:42] are the sons of god see you always were
[54:44] the sons of god
[54:45] for when god had you in his thinking at
[54:47] the beginning you had to be some part of
[54:49] you
[54:49] your life that's in you now had to be
[54:51] with god before
[54:53] there well when when he before he was
[54:55] before he even become material here on
[54:57] earth
[54:58] before there was anything but god you
[55:00] were one of his attributes
[55:02] he knowed what your name would be he
[55:03] knowed the color of hair you would have
[55:07] and you're worried about what the job's
[55:09] going to do tomorrow
[55:12] you see teaching positionally places
[55:16] teaching gives us the right kind of
[55:17] faith brother branham came
[55:20] to set this doctrine straight to take
[55:23] away the fear and the scare
[55:24] he before there was one material thing
[55:27] made in the universe
[55:29] he knew what color hair you would have
[55:32] he knew what color eyes you would have
[55:34] and he knew what you would do
[55:35] why are we worried about what the job is
[55:38] going to do or what the economy is going
[55:39] to do or what's going to happen tomorrow
[55:41] before there was a tomorrow he knew what
[55:44] color eyes i was going to have
[55:49] praise god he know what color
[55:53] hair you would have he knowed all about
[55:54] you the only thing happened is when
[55:56] you being a sinner many of you can
[55:58] fellowship with me on this thought
[55:59] when you was a little boy or a little
[56:01] girl you would walk around there would
[56:03] be
[56:03] certain things that would just where it
[56:05] wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed
[56:06] like there was something in you that
[56:08] cried out
[56:09] there was god somewhere yet you were a
[56:11] sinner you remember that
[56:13] certainly now what was that that was
[56:16] that little form of life in you then
[56:20] it was in you then it didn't come to
[56:22] your new birth it was there
[56:24] the holy spirit the spirit of christ the
[56:26] spirit of god came to you to waken that
[56:27] up to bring it to life
[56:29] it didn't bring it to you amen what
[56:31] happened was two parts a male and female
[56:33] part come together for a new birth
[56:38] see brother branham is telling us this
[56:42] to take the scare away
[56:44] i was walking here last night at 10 30
[56:46] at night or something like that it was
[56:47] dark and i was
[56:48] walking down the lane down this way and
[56:51] looking at the stars and i just began to
[56:52] cry
[56:54] because i was thinking this quote and i
[56:55] realized god i have loved you all my
[56:57] life
[56:59] i remember as a little boy wanting to
[57:01] know god
[57:04] i mean i didn't know how to get saved i
[57:05] went to the altar a couple times and
[57:07] you know in the pentecostal church i
[57:09] didn't know how to meet god i didn't
[57:10] know how to connect him i didn't know
[57:11] very much
[57:12] but there was something down in me and i
[57:14] can say from the bottom of my heart i've
[57:15] loved god all my life
[57:18] even backslidden even doing wrong even
[57:20] when when i regret the things that i was
[57:22] doing and the times in my life
[57:24] there was something in me i've loved god
[57:26] all my life
[57:28] where did that come from what is that
[57:32] that's more than a man that's more than
[57:34] a human being when
[57:36] sometimes still when i'm alone you know
[57:37] and the pressure comes off and i'm not
[57:39] worried about all the things that i need
[57:41] to do decisions i need to make but i
[57:42] just get out and i take a walk and i'm
[57:44] under the stars
[57:45] all of a sudden when all that lifts that
[57:47] thing comes right back
[57:49] and i begin to weep and i begin to say
[57:50] god i love you
[57:52] and all i want under those conditions
[57:54] the only thing in my life i want is the
[57:56] knowing more
[57:58] i mean you'll weep underneath the
[58:00] heavens you'll weep when you see
[58:02] uh the grandeur and beauty of his
[58:03] creation you weep when you hear the word
[58:05] when you read the message when you
[58:07] listening you begin to weep and then you
[58:09] give a longing for me i have a longing
[58:11] i want whatever this barrier is in me
[58:15] because no matter i love him so much but
[58:17] i still feel
[58:19] i still feel that there's more
[58:22] i still feel a barrier and it's the
[58:24] barrier of hybridization
[58:27] no matter how how much we grow how
[58:30] really makes himself
[58:31] no matter how many experiences we have
[58:33] amen i'm longing to break through this
[58:35] barrier of hybridization
[58:37] amen and to know him as i am known to
[58:39] break through and go to complete freedom
[58:41] out of human carnality
[58:44] i want more of him not less and
[58:47] when i say more of him i'm not looking
[58:49] for a new doctrine or a new revelation
[58:52] that's how he gives himself more of us
[58:54] more revelation he reveals himself more
[58:56] but i'm not even talking about that i
[58:58] just want i just want to be closer
[59:00] whatever this distance is i want to
[59:01] bridge the gap
[59:03] whatever bridges that gap is what i want
[59:05] i've loved him all my life
[59:08] you've loved him all your life how why
[59:12] what caused you to pray little prayers
[59:14] when you were five and six and seven
[59:16] years old what was that
[59:18] that was god in there where did it come
[59:22] from
[59:23] it came from the mind of god from before
[59:25] the foundation of the world
[59:27] so many of you many of you can relate
[59:30] with me on this
[59:32] there was a little something form of
[59:33] life in you then
[59:35] then after a while you heard the gospel
[59:37] maybe you went to church you picked out
[59:39] this and that
[59:40] and went from denomination to
[59:41] denomination but one day you being part
[59:43] of god you had to be part of the word
[59:46] and when you heard the word you know
[59:48] where you come from
[59:50] you know that was the truth you were
[59:52] always the seed was in you
[59:53] always the word seen the word that was
[59:56] in you
[59:56] that was before the foundation of the
[59:58] world saw the word and you
[1:00:00] came to it
[1:00:03] it wasn't what you did right it wasn't
[1:00:06] your successes
[1:00:08] it wasn't even even though god would use
[1:00:10] correct teaching and
[1:00:12] correct gospel and it wasn't just the
[1:00:14] correctness of the teaching
[1:00:17] it was the word finding the word
[1:00:21] it was the word coming to the word it
[1:00:23] was that part of you
[1:00:24] that came from god connecting to another
[1:00:27] part that came from god
[1:00:29] the word to the word and brought that
[1:00:32] seed to life
[1:00:34] and the power of transformation brother
[1:00:35] man says and we we had talked
[1:00:38] talked about the word of predestination
[1:00:39] you see that stumbles so many of them
[1:00:42] it's god's word he uses it for we are
[1:00:45] predestinated by the word of god
[1:00:47] and in that when you were predestinated
[1:00:49] why it has it has to happen
[1:00:52] because it is that god chose you because
[1:00:54] he knowed what you would do
[1:00:56] from the beginning so i'm wanting to
[1:00:58] move on into placing of sons
[1:01:00] i'm just we're still laying a foundation
[1:01:02] but we're moving on
[1:01:03] god chose you because he knowed what you
[1:01:05] would do from the beginning
[1:01:08] and and so many times we're struggling
[1:01:10] with what can i do for the lord what
[1:01:11] should i do for the lord
[1:01:12] he already knows and sometimes what i
[1:01:16] think we need to do more than anything
[1:01:18] that's what i want to get across today
[1:01:19] is quit fretting
[1:01:21] more than anything we just need to quit
[1:01:22] fretting and we need to quit trying
[1:01:25] and we need to start resting and start
[1:01:27] trusting because he knew what i would do
[1:01:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:32] in ephesians 2 let's go look at
[1:01:34] ephesians 2 together
[1:01:56] ephesians chapter two brother ben has a
[1:01:58] quote we'll get to in a minute but
[1:01:59] brother starts talking about the
[1:02:00] ephesians is the
[1:02:02] joshua of the new testament the joshua
[1:02:05] the new testament
[1:02:06] brings them to a promised land and
[1:02:08] joshua begins to positionally place them
[1:02:10] in the promised land
[1:02:11] and brother baby tells him that's what
[1:02:12] ephesians is and we went through that
[1:02:14] when we talked about armenians
[1:02:15] versus calvinism and how ephesians pulls
[1:02:18] the two together
[1:02:19] but brother brown starts off the book of
[1:02:20] ephesians or paul starts it off in the
[1:02:22] book of ephesians
[1:02:23] by so securely placing you in
[1:02:26] predestination in christ that you can
[1:02:28] have no
[1:02:28] doubt about who you are
[1:02:31] and then he comes in the middle and he
[1:02:33] begins to tell you that you've got a
[1:02:34] position or a place in the body
[1:02:36] and then at the end he tells you now go
[1:02:38] do it
[1:02:40] and and balances the thing out but
[1:02:43] ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 let's just
[1:02:45] read this
[1:02:47] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:02:49] and that not of yourselves it is the
[1:02:50] gift of god
[1:02:51] not of works lest any men should boast
[1:02:53] for we are his workmanship
[1:02:55] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:02:58] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:03:00] should walk in them
[1:03:02] so god we're his workmanship we are
[1:03:05] god's workmanship we are the thing that
[1:03:07] he's working on his we
[1:03:08] let's i'd say it this way we are his
[1:03:10] project
[1:03:13] we are his project we're his building
[1:03:14] where his vineyard where his
[1:03:16] garden we are his project
[1:03:19] that he created in christ jesus unto
[1:03:21] good works
[1:03:23] that that which god has before ordained
[1:03:25] that we should walk in them
[1:03:26] he already determined that there's
[1:03:28] something for you to do he knew there's
[1:03:30] something for moses to do knew there was
[1:03:31] something for paul to do there was
[1:03:33] something for noah to do
[1:03:34] amen but but so many times we can look
[1:03:36] at the bible stories and we could see he
[1:03:38] had something for brother branham to do
[1:03:40] and we could see amen these big tangible
[1:03:42] things in these large ministries
[1:03:44] and we say yeah i see that for them but
[1:03:45] what about for me if it's true for them
[1:03:47] it's true for you too it's true for
[1:03:49] every attribute of god so
[1:03:53] so i think sometimes so so many times
[1:03:56] we reference the scriptures and we point
[1:03:58] to like noah building an ark i mean
[1:04:00] that's a huge endeavor
[1:04:03] moses bringing a ministry amen and gone
[1:04:05] through him destroying egypt and
[1:04:07] bringing them out with a mighty hand
[1:04:09] that's a huge thing amen but you realize
[1:04:11] that's no
[1:04:12] different than what he's called us to do
[1:04:14] moses only walked in obedience god did
[1:04:16] all the work moses didn't do anything
[1:04:19] all moses did was obey when god said
[1:04:22] speak he spoke
[1:04:23] when god said move he moved he realized
[1:04:25] it wasn't moses
[1:04:26] it was god and god gave a portion of
[1:04:29] moses a portion of noah a portion to you
[1:04:31] in a portion to me
[1:04:33] and it's not us it's him and if he
[1:04:35] chooses your portion
[1:04:37] amen if he chooses your portion to be
[1:04:39] something that they won't write articles
[1:04:41] about
[1:04:41] amen then what is it to us to begrudge
[1:04:43] the portion he's given to us
[1:04:46] what are we saying about the great mind
[1:04:48] of god and the great wisdom of god
[1:04:50] and the plan he had before the
[1:04:51] foundation of the world
[1:04:53] so many times we're stomping right on
[1:04:55] the plan and purpose of god in our life
[1:04:58] stepping on it trying to reach for
[1:04:59] something that's not ours
[1:05:03] for a gift or a position and it's not
[1:05:06] even ours
[1:05:08] and we're stomping and treading all over
[1:05:10] the beautiful thing he's trying to do
[1:05:11] through us
[1:05:13] because to us it doesn't have great
[1:05:15] value
[1:05:18] but it's the self-existing one
[1:05:20] expressing himself
[1:05:22] as a mama as a daddy
[1:05:26] as a metal worker as a as a mailman
[1:05:31] and we want to play that down
[1:05:34] because i want to have a gift i want to
[1:05:37] be like brother so-and-so i want to be
[1:05:39] like sister so-and-so
[1:05:40] i want to play i want to sing i want to
[1:05:42] write a song
[1:05:47] amen he already knows he knows what
[1:05:50] works you do you created in the good
[1:05:52] works which he before ordained that you
[1:05:53] should do before the foundation of the
[1:05:55] world
[1:05:56] he knows what you'll do we just need to
[1:05:58] get with his program and relax
[1:06:01] relax in adoption part four he says how
[1:06:04] was our inheritance given to us through
[1:06:05] what
[1:06:06] predestination predestination is
[1:06:08] foreknowledge
[1:06:09] how did god know he would trust you to
[1:06:11] be a preacher his foreknowledge
[1:06:15] not because you were doing a good job at
[1:06:17] being a christian
[1:06:20] how did he know he could trust you be a
[1:06:21] preacher you were doing a good job of
[1:06:23] being a christian
[1:06:23] so he decided that's somebody i can make
[1:06:26] a preacher
[1:06:28] his foreknowledge knew you would be a
[1:06:30] preacher he may have had to wait for you
[1:06:31] to get in the right condition he made it
[1:06:33] wait for you to submit
[1:06:34] he he may have had to bring the
[1:06:36] preaching of the word to wash some
[1:06:37] things out of your life before he could
[1:06:38] put you in that position
[1:06:39] but he always knew you would be there
[1:06:42] amen how did he know he could trust you
[1:06:43] with it
[1:06:44] because of his foreknowledge not because
[1:06:46] of the merit of your character
[1:06:49] but because of his foreknowledge i mean
[1:06:51] god doesn't choose somebody to be a
[1:06:53] songwriter or a singer or a musician
[1:06:55] a man or a song leader or a preacher on
[1:06:57] the merit of their conduct but it's
[1:06:58] based on their foreknowledge
[1:07:01] that's why some of those people were
[1:07:02] horrible heathens before
[1:07:06] god called them and it wasn't the merit
[1:07:08] of their conduct that god used
[1:07:09] although god had to bring him into the
[1:07:11] body god had to sanctify him he had to
[1:07:13] get him in a certain position so that he
[1:07:14] could use them amen
[1:07:16] why did he do that you realize it's not
[1:07:18] because that they put their home in
[1:07:19] order
[1:07:20] that god says now i'm going to make you
[1:07:22] a preacher
[1:07:23] or you know it's not climbing the
[1:07:26] corporate ladder
[1:07:28] all right you come and you cleaned
[1:07:30] yourself up you got a haircut
[1:07:32] you wore a tie to church amen and god's
[1:07:34] going to now make you a deacon
[1:07:37] and you've done a good job you put your
[1:07:39] home in order you follow now god's going
[1:07:40] to make you a preacher
[1:07:45] which one is the highest position in the
[1:07:47] body
[1:07:49] brother brown said he that's the
[1:07:51] greatest should be servant of all
[1:07:54] and the term minister means servant
[1:07:58] and if you go to the bible
[1:08:01] servant was not like now would be like
[1:08:04] oh he's the servant of god
[1:08:08] but that term in the bible's servant was
[1:08:10] the foot washed flunky
[1:08:11] the one who did the dishes the one who
[1:08:13] cleaned out the chamber pot
[1:08:16] realized the servant the slave i mean
[1:08:18] the lowest in the household was the
[1:08:20] servant
[1:08:20] amen and the minister is the servant
[1:08:24] that's what ministry means service
[1:08:27] it's not a place to climb up to
[1:08:31] amen it's not it's not a it's not a
[1:08:34] reward for being a good christian
[1:08:37] it's not a it's not a projection on my
[1:08:40] scale of christianity
[1:08:42] that someday like somebody says someday
[1:08:44] i want to be a manager of this
[1:08:45] department
[1:08:45] someday i want to be a minister
[1:08:51] no someday i want to fully trust in god
[1:08:55] and him to have preeminence so he can do
[1:08:56] exactly what he wanted to do in my life
[1:08:59] i want to someday get to the place where
[1:09:01] i'm not hindering him in any way
[1:09:02] and i'm not slowing him down or holding
[1:09:04] him back in any way that's our goal
[1:09:05] friends that's our projection
[1:09:07] my projection is for him to have
[1:09:08] preeminence in me
[1:09:12] that's why david could say i would
[1:09:14] rather i would rather be the doorkeeper
[1:09:16] i'd rather
[1:09:17] lay at the door than in king's tents
[1:09:19] king's palaces
[1:09:21] i whatever position i mean whatever i
[1:09:23] can do for god
[1:09:24] is greater than anything else and he was
[1:09:27] king of israel he says
[1:09:31] brother bram says improving his word
[1:09:35] when i look around sometime and see
[1:09:37] these rickeys and raketas that we got
[1:09:39] today and on the streets and
[1:09:40] how everything's going on i think oh god
[1:09:44] wait a minute he says see my timepiece
[1:09:46] is turning just exactly
[1:09:48] right i've got to put you up on the same
[1:09:49] basis i did the first man
[1:09:52] them days and i put you on the same
[1:09:54] basis of luther and on the same basis of
[1:09:56] wesley
[1:09:57] because you see sin wasn't known then
[1:09:59] like it is now
[1:10:01] and when we got more knowledge now than
[1:10:03] we had then
[1:10:04] and when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:10:05] the spirit of god raises a standard
[1:10:07] against it
[1:10:08] and now today we've got more knowledge
[1:10:10] more understanding
[1:10:11] so the rivers of unbelief is flowing in
[1:10:13] hard
[1:10:14] but god raises a standard against it but
[1:10:17] remember
[1:10:18] the reason the reason he predestinated
[1:10:20] these things to happen he foretold them
[1:10:22] by his prophets that they would happen
[1:10:24] and when the righteous see those things
[1:10:26] confirmed then they know it's right
[1:10:28] regardless of what anyone else says
[1:10:30] see they know it's right we find out
[1:10:32] over there and i believe it is first
[1:10:35] thessalonians he said
[1:10:36] he has predestinated us into the
[1:10:38] adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:10:40] god not saying i'll choose you i don't
[1:10:42] choose you but his foreknowledge
[1:10:44] knowed what you would do and so now
[1:10:48] we we see the world is getting so wicked
[1:10:50] and so bad
[1:10:52] i mean it has grown so much worse and i
[1:10:55] say the last two years
[1:10:58] wickedness on the increase depredation i
[1:11:00] mean things that are just
[1:11:02] i mean you can hardly talk about
[1:11:06] but why why why would god put me in this
[1:11:10] age
[1:11:11] why would god put me here he knew before
[1:11:13] the foundation of the world you would be
[1:11:15] here
[1:11:16] and he made sure you had some
[1:11:17] ingredients inside of you
[1:11:19] that was a perfect match for the day
[1:11:20] that you would live in because he knew
[1:11:22] satan's eating would come to culmination
[1:11:24] he knew it would come to a perfect
[1:11:25] satan's eating he knew
[1:11:27] evil would come amen to perfect freedom
[1:11:29] to express itself
[1:11:32] so before the foundation of the world he
[1:11:33] put something in you to overcome that
[1:11:36] that's why you're here in this wicked
[1:11:37] day that's why you're here in this evil
[1:11:39] age
[1:11:40] because you've been predestinated to
[1:11:41] meet the challenge of the hour
[1:11:44] so there's no fear about oh what will
[1:11:47] happen to our family how will we raise
[1:11:49] our children
[1:11:49] if it gets much worse what are we going
[1:11:51] to do you've been predestinated to make
[1:11:53] the final stand and the worst of times
[1:11:57] you are you were called in christ jesus
[1:11:59] under good works which he before
[1:12:00] ordained that you would do
[1:12:01] if there's a stand to be taken there was
[1:12:03] a stand in the foreknowledge of god
[1:12:05] and god knew who would make that stand
[1:12:07] and he pre-programmed you
[1:12:09] in the seat on the inside to make the
[1:12:11] stand
[1:12:13] he pre-programmed you to stand in the
[1:12:15] face of wickedness and evil
[1:12:17] and debauchery he's still in the world
[1:12:19] falling apart
[1:12:20] you are pre-programmed to stand in this
[1:12:22] day
[1:12:24] how do you know that brother chad
[1:12:25] because you're here in this day and god
[1:12:26] doesn't make mistakes and he knew
[1:12:28] he knew his works from the beginning of
[1:12:30] the world
[1:12:31] he knew what he would do he's not
[1:12:32] changing anything now you realize
[1:12:34] he didn't have to come amen and say oh
[1:12:37] man it's getting pretty bad
[1:12:38] uh things are getting bad i better open
[1:12:40] the seal so they'll make it
[1:12:43] he knew exactly when it would get bad
[1:12:46] when he was going to open the seals
[1:12:47] when he was going to bring the
[1:12:48] revelation of his great mystery because
[1:12:50] everything is clicking just right on
[1:12:52] time
[1:12:55] you're here because you're supposed to
[1:12:56] be here it's bad because it's supposed
[1:12:59] to be bad
[1:13:02] and you're able to overcome because he
[1:13:03] predestinated you to overcome
[1:13:06] this condition
[1:13:09] stock market crashes and you lose all
[1:13:11] your investment you're predestinated to
[1:13:13] go through that trial
[1:13:15] don't wring your hands don't
[1:13:19] fret and worry god
[1:13:22] has ordained us to be here he's ordained
[1:13:24] the works
[1:13:26] and sometimes in order to get
[1:13:30] in order to get us where we need to be
[1:13:33] he lets things get really bad
[1:13:36] so he can express what's on the inside
[1:13:38] of us which was in his mind before the
[1:13:39] foundation of the world
[1:13:42] see david david
[1:13:46] was programmed to kill a bear
[1:13:49] did god know that david would kill a
[1:13:51] lion and kill a bear
[1:13:53] you believe that so if god
[1:13:56] knew that david could kill a lion and
[1:13:57] kill a bear and he programmed david for
[1:13:59] killing a lion killing a bear
[1:14:01] and that was part of the works from
[1:14:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:04] then you realize god had to send a lion
[1:14:08] because he already in his mind knew
[1:14:10] david would slay the lion
[1:14:12] so god had to allow the lion to come
[1:14:17] you know and it probably wasn't david's
[1:14:19] best day on the job
[1:14:23] it probably wasn't the most the most
[1:14:25] rewarding thing that ever happened in
[1:14:26] his life
[1:14:27] he was probably under tension he was
[1:14:28] probably afraid he probably
[1:14:30] i mean there was all kinds of emotions
[1:14:32] he was going through and he probably
[1:14:33] felt responsible he probably was nervous
[1:14:35] he was probably all alone
[1:14:36] amen all the things that you and i go
[1:14:38] through when we face danger and we face
[1:14:40] trouble but he was already programmed to
[1:14:43] kill the lion
[1:14:45] but but when he killed the lion he
[1:14:46] wasn't done because he was already
[1:14:47] programmed to kill the bear
[1:14:49] so after god sends a lion now god's
[1:14:51] obligated to allow the bear to come
[1:14:56] he was also programmed to kill goliath
[1:15:01] you know we don't put ourselves in
[1:15:03] position god puts us in position
[1:15:06] david never woke up and said i'm going
[1:15:08] to be a giant
[1:15:10] killer today he was programmed before
[1:15:12] the foundation of the world to be the
[1:15:14] one that god would use
[1:15:16] and that didn't make him a better son
[1:15:19] than the other seven sons
[1:15:23] even jesse didn't believe that it was
[1:15:25] david
[1:15:26] maybe there was characteristics in the
[1:15:28] other ones that far outshined his
[1:15:29] characteristics
[1:15:31] maybe there was attributes that that
[1:15:32] even his father jesse saw
[1:15:34] and no doubt samuel psalm 2 and the
[1:15:36] first one that would really
[1:15:38] this would be the one but god had
[1:15:40] already determined who it would be
[1:15:42] so the anointing oil was poured out on
[1:15:44] the correct one
[1:15:46] that's why martin luther's not here
[1:15:48] today
[1:15:49] that's why john wesley's not here today
[1:15:52] and i'll tell you something else that's
[1:15:53] why brother white brother bam is not
[1:15:55] here today
[1:15:57] he was programmed for his part he did it
[1:15:59] your program for this part
[1:16:02] you can't take his place and he can't
[1:16:04] take your place
[1:16:09] because david was designed predestinated
[1:16:12] to kill goliath
[1:16:16] god had to move his daddy to want to
[1:16:19] send cheese and bread
[1:16:22] on a certain day at a certain time
[1:16:25] to a certain place you realize for david
[1:16:29] to begin to move into his purpose into
[1:16:31] god's plan for his life
[1:16:33] david never moved himself
[1:16:36] if you watch the plan of god and the
[1:16:38] children of god down through the old
[1:16:40] testament to the new testament
[1:16:42] these people weren't they weren't they
[1:16:44] weren't going down through catalogs of
[1:16:46] jobs i can do for god
[1:16:48] they weren't rolling the roll of decks
[1:16:50] and see i got these skills and these
[1:16:51] qualifications they weren't shopping for
[1:16:53] a job
[1:16:54] they weren't brushing up their resume
[1:16:56] they weren't trying to get new skill
[1:16:57] sets
[1:16:57] to eventually move into a position that
[1:17:00] god worked out all the circumstances
[1:17:03] god did all the work he got everybody in
[1:17:05] the right place at the right time to do
[1:17:06] the right thing
[1:17:07] and if he had to interrupt him if he had
[1:17:09] to meet him with a pillar of fire to
[1:17:11] interrupt their plans and knock them off
[1:17:12] their horse
[1:17:13] he did it because it was his purpose and
[1:17:14] his plan paul wasn't looking to be the
[1:17:17] church age messenger
[1:17:19] brother branham wasn't looking to be the
[1:17:21] church age messenger but it was god's
[1:17:23] plan from before the foundation of the
[1:17:24] world so god was obligated to come to
[1:17:27] him and put him in a position
[1:17:28] brother branham never could have put
[1:17:29] himself in he didn't have the resources
[1:17:31] he didn't have the friendships he had
[1:17:34] nothing to put himself in the position
[1:17:36] god put him in
[1:17:37] he didn't have the education he didn't
[1:17:39] have the speaking style he didn't have
[1:17:41] he had nothing you brother had nothing
[1:17:44] to make possible a worldwide ministry
[1:17:48] but god had called him to a worldwide
[1:17:50] ministry so god
[1:17:51] it looked like with this circumstance
[1:17:54] that circumstance
[1:17:55] that circumstance man you got lucky
[1:18:01] you know i've even heard people i've
[1:18:02] heard this with my own ears
[1:18:06] you know if things have went another way
[1:18:08] if i had made a few different decisions
[1:18:09] i could have seen myself in the ministry
[1:18:16] if really that thinking is here let's
[1:18:18] flush that out today
[1:18:21] you know if i hadn't made a few
[1:18:22] different decisions if i would have done
[1:18:23] things a little different if something
[1:18:25] would have went different i would
[1:18:26] i could have had that position or i
[1:18:27] could have been that or i could have
[1:18:29] done that
[1:18:32] you've just made your decision more
[1:18:34] powerful than god's purpose from before
[1:18:36] the foundation of the world
[1:18:41] i said god have your way in me
[1:18:44] you know the way that i take you know
[1:18:47] the predestinated plan
[1:18:48] help me to walk in him
[1:18:53] now i want to go just a little bit
[1:18:54] further and
[1:18:56] adoption part two baby says
[1:19:00] when did you notice moses that great
[1:19:03] miracle performer that
[1:19:04] brought down israel down through the
[1:19:06] land and brought them up to the promised
[1:19:07] land but did not
[1:19:09] place their inheritance to them he did
[1:19:10] not give them their inheritance
[1:19:12] he led them up to the land but joshua
[1:19:14] divided the land to the people
[1:19:16] is that right and christ brought the
[1:19:18] church up to the place
[1:19:19] where the possession was made to them
[1:19:21] was given to them just
[1:19:22] the jordan to cross but the holy spirit
[1:19:24] is the one who sets the church in order
[1:19:26] the joshua
[1:19:28] of today puts the church in order in its
[1:19:30] order giving to each one gifts
[1:19:32] places position and he is the voice of
[1:19:35] god speaking to the inner man
[1:19:36] that christ has saved the holy spirit
[1:19:39] how do you get that much of it now we
[1:19:42] now we're getting over into the book of
[1:19:43] ephesians now the same way
[1:19:45] he positionally placed the church where
[1:19:47] they belong
[1:19:48] now joshua places them in the natural
[1:19:50] land
[1:19:51] the holy spirit is placing the church
[1:19:53] positionally in the land
[1:19:55] that they in the position that they
[1:19:56] belong in in their inheritance
[1:19:59] so now as joshua come he represents the
[1:20:03] holy ghost today
[1:20:04] who puts everybody in their position
[1:20:06] amen so now
[1:20:07] this tribe goes here because the word of
[1:20:09] god declared it the prophet said
[1:20:11] now he's dividing it out and he's
[1:20:13] positionally placing
[1:20:15] all the believers in that day into the
[1:20:17] proper place
[1:20:18] amen and brother brahms typing that
[1:20:20] right now with ephesians and right where
[1:20:21] we're at
[1:20:22] that god is placing each one of us in
[1:20:24] the place that we belong
[1:20:26] by the holy ghost and he's doing it in
[1:20:29] the word
[1:20:30] and i i just want to i'm going to cut
[1:20:32] ahead for a minute
[1:20:33] to something i want to say we we say
[1:20:37] sometimes when we come to the lord
[1:20:39] and god gets a hold of our life and
[1:20:40] we're filled with the spirit and we
[1:20:42] begin to live a life for him
[1:20:44] we're looking for something new
[1:20:46] something different
[1:20:47] another position sometimes they're
[1:20:49] coming to adoption i need a position in
[1:20:51] the church
[1:20:53] and and paul says remain as you are in
[1:20:56] whatever vocation you came and remain
[1:20:57] there
[1:20:58] if you're a soldier stay a soldier if
[1:21:00] you're married stay married you stay in
[1:21:01] whatever state you came
[1:21:04] but your positional placing is placing
[1:21:07] in the word
[1:21:09] in wherever you are in life so if i
[1:21:12] could explain it this way you say
[1:21:14] you know what's my position and i would
[1:21:17] ask you where you're at
[1:21:19] like what's going on in your life where
[1:21:20] are you at are you married do you have
[1:21:22] children
[1:21:23] are you a wife and a mother initially
[1:21:27] i'm going to say well there's your
[1:21:27] position
[1:21:29] your position is a wife your position
[1:21:31] your mother your position is a father
[1:21:33] your position is you know i'm i'm this
[1:21:35] kind of employee
[1:21:36] employee i'm this or that that's your
[1:21:38] position because that's where god called
[1:21:40] you when you were in that he called you
[1:21:41] in that
[1:21:42] and the apostle paul said stay that way
[1:21:45] right so that's your position but you
[1:21:47] said but i was doing this before
[1:21:50] and i'll say it this way you weren't
[1:21:53] doing it according to the word before
[1:21:57] you may have been a mother but you
[1:21:58] weren't a word mother
[1:22:01] you may have been a wife but you weren't
[1:22:02] a word wife you may have been a husband
[1:22:05] but you weren't a word husband
[1:22:06] you want a word father you were just a
[1:22:09] father like every other
[1:22:11] every other human that has an ability to
[1:22:12] procreate as a father but when god calls
[1:22:14] you into the word he places you
[1:22:16] as a godly father as a godly mother
[1:22:20] as a word wife as a word husband as a
[1:22:24] word employee see
[1:22:27] sometimes we get the wrong idea amen
[1:22:30] we're coming into adoption i've got to
[1:22:32] have a place in the body of christ
[1:22:33] amen i've got to find find my position
[1:22:37] don't worry your position will find you
[1:22:41] just walk true to the word walk in
[1:22:43] submissive life
[1:22:44] and whatever you are be a word employee
[1:22:47] be a word employer
[1:22:49] be a word grandfather be a word retiree
[1:22:55] you know let the word have preeminence
[1:22:57] because that's what he wants
[1:22:58] jesus christ wants to be known
[1:23:01] as a father as a mother as a husband
[1:23:05] as a wife it's the expression of jehovah
[1:23:08] in you so so many times we're looking
[1:23:11] looking for a position that's why i said
[1:23:12] you're trampling over the one you've got
[1:23:14] i i have watched with my own eyes and
[1:23:17] grieved in my heart
[1:23:18] at men who called it a young age into
[1:23:20] the ministry
[1:23:21] and they absolutely devalue their family
[1:23:24] to try to preach the gospel trample over
[1:23:27] the heart of their wife
[1:23:28] and ignore their children i have watched
[1:23:30] with my own eyes
[1:23:31] as a man in the ministry will run from
[1:23:33] place to place he's not even preaching
[1:23:35] but he'll go from meeting the meeting
[1:23:36] and what he's out there doing is
[1:23:37] networking trying to find places to
[1:23:39] preach
[1:23:40] and he's got a wife at home with two or
[1:23:42] three little babies trying to do it
[1:23:43] herself
[1:23:44] i'd say he's not fit to preach
[1:23:47] because he's trampling over a god-given
[1:23:49] position reaching for another one
[1:23:51] and i would say he's got no business
[1:23:53] taking it if god wants you to have it
[1:23:54] he'll give it to you you don't have to
[1:23:56] go from meeting to meeting convention to
[1:23:58] convention
[1:23:58] ministers this and that to try to get a
[1:24:00] place to preach
[1:24:03] if god wants you to preach he'll have
[1:24:05] you preach they'll find your number
[1:24:06] they'll look you up you don't even have
[1:24:08] to print a business card
[1:24:11] i've never had one i still don't have
[1:24:14] one
[1:24:16] right there's too much self-promotion
[1:24:18] too much grabbing too much seeking
[1:24:20] and not enough just resting and let god
[1:24:22] be god and trust in god's plan for my
[1:24:25] life
[1:24:25] and surrender wherever i'm at if if god
[1:24:28] has given me
[1:24:29] a wife if i'm a newly married man then
[1:24:31] my whole ministry
[1:24:33] is as a husband to that wife
[1:24:36] if i'm a brother in the church my
[1:24:38] ministry is a brother in the church
[1:24:40] if i'm a sister in the church my
[1:24:41] ministry is a sister in the church
[1:24:43] if i have a husband my ministry is a
[1:24:45] wife if i have a wife my ministry is a
[1:24:47] husband
[1:24:49] and sometimes we we make silly comments
[1:24:51] but i'm seeking the lord from my
[1:24:53] position
[1:24:55] how are you doing with the one you have
[1:24:58] how's your family doing how does your
[1:25:01] wife feel
[1:25:02] how are your children doing
[1:25:05] how is your attendance to church how do
[1:25:08] the brothers and sisters around you feel
[1:25:10] do they feel loved and encouraging
[1:25:15] you see positional placing is not about
[1:25:18] a
[1:25:18] title in the church
[1:25:22] it's about the position in the body that
[1:25:24] you hold
[1:25:26] you realize all of these gifts are
[1:25:28] mingled out through the whole body
[1:25:31] you take the gift of knowledge knowledge
[1:25:33] what is knowledge
[1:25:35] knowledge is understanding of the word
[1:25:37] what is wisdom
[1:25:38] wisdom is the proper application of that
[1:25:40] word
[1:25:43] you think only preachers have knowledge
[1:25:46] and wisdom i can name off names i won't
[1:25:49] because they'd be embarrassed but i can
[1:25:51] tell you people
[1:25:52] who have a gift of knowledge in the word
[1:25:54] in this assembly and never preach once
[1:25:56] in the pulpit
[1:25:57] and they have a ministry to the rest of
[1:25:59] the body you can sit with them and if
[1:26:01] you've got a question about the bible
[1:26:03] they can start flipping through and
[1:26:04] telling you where it is in the message
[1:26:05] and what brother ben
[1:26:06] said about it what is that that's
[1:26:09] part of the body a joint that supplieth
[1:26:14] same thing with the gift of wisdom gift
[1:26:16] of helps there's people with a gift of
[1:26:18] help
[1:26:18] you know what they don't know how they
[1:26:19] do it but they always find themselves
[1:26:21] helping
[1:26:23] and sometimes they ask themselves how do
[1:26:25] i always get in this position
[1:26:29] how does this how does this always
[1:26:31] happen to me
[1:26:33] because that's a position in the body
[1:26:35] other people can recognize it they come
[1:26:37] and ask you for help because you're good
[1:26:38] at it
[1:26:40] because it's a gift i mean sometimes we
[1:26:42] don't even recognize that we are
[1:26:43] positionally placed
[1:26:44] god has put us in the body he's put you
[1:26:47] in the local assembly he wants you
[1:26:48] he's put you in the family he's gonna
[1:26:50] want you in amen he's put you under the
[1:26:52] ministry he wants you under
[1:26:53] amen and whatever he's done to you
[1:26:55] genetically
[1:26:59] naturally genetically is part of that
[1:27:01] calling
[1:27:03] the parents the grandparents all that he
[1:27:05] worked together to get you the way are
[1:27:07] just so you can have that certain ring
[1:27:09] to the bell and so you can do that
[1:27:10] certain thing
[1:27:11] amen and it may never show up on the on
[1:27:14] the billboards it may never show up
[1:27:16] even in a grand announcement or even a
[1:27:18] grand thank you from the pulpit
[1:27:19] but it's an essential part of the body
[1:27:24] and so when i started talking about
[1:27:25] positional placing so many times
[1:27:27] you know we can get nervous and start
[1:27:28] thinking about well you know i mean i
[1:27:30] don't know if i'm a deacon i don't know
[1:27:31] if i'm a trustee i don't know if i'm a
[1:27:32] sunday school this or that
[1:27:35] it's like i'll tell you right now hands
[1:27:38] down
[1:27:38] i would love to be a singer
[1:27:41] secret desire of mine
[1:27:46] if i got the pick i'd go to god and say
[1:27:48] god
[1:27:49] i mean let me sing
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:53] let me sing you know what
[1:27:56] it doesn't matter how hard i try or how
[1:27:59] i deceive
[1:28:00] myself when i'm alone
[1:28:05] that's not my position i can't do it
[1:28:10] i tried to have an altar call a couple
[1:28:12] times it was a flop
[1:28:15] that's not my style ministry i did it
[1:28:18] because i saw other people do it
[1:28:20] it was effective i saw a need i thought
[1:28:22] i'll try to meet the need
[1:28:24] it went over like a lead balloon i was
[1:28:28] in the philippines one time and i
[1:28:29] preached my heart out
[1:28:30] and honestly i have no idea how to have
[1:28:32] an altar call
[1:28:34] i don't know how people do it but some
[1:28:37] people i mean it's just like
[1:28:38] wham and people are weeping and crying
[1:28:41] and i'm like
[1:28:42] that's wonderful i can't do it
[1:28:46] i was in the philippines one time just
[1:28:47] preached my heart out just a message
[1:28:48] that preached my heart out
[1:28:51] and all of a sudden people started
[1:28:52] coming up for prayer i started praying
[1:28:53] for people
[1:28:54] a prayer line started we went through a
[1:28:56] prayer line people were getting
[1:28:57] delivered things were happening
[1:28:58] i ended up praying for almost the whole
[1:29:00] church and standing there for two hours
[1:29:04] could i repeat that not on your life
[1:29:07] i have no idea how to do those things
[1:29:09] see it's not about
[1:29:10] i want to be this style i want to have
[1:29:12] that and i'm mimicking this
[1:29:13] this is what's needed and i want to fill
[1:29:15] this need it doesn't matter what's
[1:29:17] needed if you're not the recipe
[1:29:18] if you're not the ingredient to fill to
[1:29:20] meet that need all you're going to do is
[1:29:22] mess the whole thing up
[1:29:24] if i come here every day and i try to
[1:29:26] bring convicting messages and really
[1:29:28] blah blah blah
[1:29:29] and get you fired up and come to the
[1:29:30] altar every service you guys would be
[1:29:32] standing looking at me like a mule
[1:29:33] looking at a new gate like what is wrong
[1:29:35] with him
[1:29:36] because it wouldn't fit it wouldn't
[1:29:38] click it wouldn't have that
[1:29:39] feeling but when you come and just be
[1:29:43] what god made you
[1:29:44] it fits when you see somebody who's got
[1:29:47] wisdom or somebody who's got a gift of
[1:29:49] helps or
[1:29:49] or an encourager when you see it it just
[1:29:52] clicks it just
[1:29:53] fits it's not a misfit you don't have to
[1:29:56] make it fit you don't have to wiggle it
[1:29:57] around and pop it in position
[1:30:00] it's just a fit see we're predestinated
[1:30:05] unto the placing of sons to be a working
[1:30:08] member of the body
[1:30:10] to work with the whole body but we don't
[1:30:13] need a certain title
[1:30:16] we don't need to use our own mind we
[1:30:18] just need to yield to the lord
[1:30:20] let's turn to ephesians 4. i read this a
[1:30:23] couple weeks ago but i'd like to read it
[1:30:25] again
[1:30:26] and i want to remind you of solomon in
[1:30:28] his golden age
[1:30:29] when when in second corinthians 9 when
[1:30:32] the queen of sheba come to him and
[1:30:34] she saw his wisdom she saw the meat of
[1:30:36] his table and she saw his cupbearers and
[1:30:38] his porters and
[1:30:39] and she saw how he went up to the lord's
[1:30:41] house and now he come to when she saw
[1:30:43] the whole kingdom
[1:30:44] what did she see she was looking at
[1:30:47] she was looking at a kingdom that was
[1:30:50] adopted
[1:30:53] you're looking at adoption because
[1:30:56] moses led them out amen under
[1:30:58] justification he led them out they went
[1:31:00] through sanctification in the wilderness
[1:31:02] and under the baptism holy ghost they
[1:31:03] come into the land brother said when you
[1:31:05] get baptized with the holy ghost under
[1:31:06] the new birth you're just getting
[1:31:08] started that's not the finish
[1:31:10] and they come into the new land and they
[1:31:12] conquer and they build they inhabit
[1:31:14] cities and they start governments and
[1:31:16] they fail and they have judges and it
[1:31:17] doesn't work and then they
[1:31:19] pick their own king and and that falls
[1:31:21] apart and but then god
[1:31:23] brings a king on the scene and that king
[1:31:25] that you know
[1:31:26] he he squashes the rebellion he brings
[1:31:28] peace to him
[1:31:29] he's in and david starts setting an
[1:31:31] order
[1:31:32] setting an order of the worship setting
[1:31:34] in order the singer setting an order of
[1:31:35] the priest
[1:31:36] he starts gathering for the temple he
[1:31:38] starts setting an order
[1:31:39] those who would be porters and those who
[1:31:41] who would judge you start setting an
[1:31:43] order then he turns it all over to the
[1:31:44] sun amen and the sun
[1:31:46] brings him into a golden age and we
[1:31:48] talked about that he begins to judge the
[1:31:50] spirits in the church
[1:31:51] that are hindering them as much as the
[1:31:54] father
[1:31:55] could give out the word much as the
[1:31:57] father and i want you to think of father
[1:31:58] and son now with david and solomon
[1:32:00] as much as the father could give out the
[1:32:02] word amen could give out the positions
[1:32:04] could give out the order
[1:32:07] until they could come to a golden age he
[1:32:09] had to come and there had to be somebody
[1:32:11] to come and pass
[1:32:12] judgment and get jealousy and envy
[1:32:15] and strife and hatred and backbiting
[1:32:18] and self-gain he had to rid the kingdom
[1:32:21] of all of that
[1:32:23] and when he read the kingdom of all of
[1:32:24] that there was already a word given and
[1:32:27] everybody began to move into the word
[1:32:29] they were already positionally placed by
[1:32:31] birth of what tribe they were born and
[1:32:33] determined what land they would be what
[1:32:35] land they moved into had a great deal to
[1:32:37] do with their occupation
[1:32:40] were in the mountains they didn't raise
[1:32:41] corn amen they heard it sheep or goats
[1:32:45] or they mined or whatever but they're
[1:32:47] where they landed by the sea
[1:32:49] amen they were fishermen in the plains
[1:32:51] they raised wheat crops
[1:32:52] wherever wherever they were positioned
[1:32:54] and they were positioned by
[1:32:55] birth brother venom says as those women
[1:32:59] would groan and travail
[1:33:00] they would call out reuben or ephraim
[1:33:03] they would call out the tribal name over
[1:33:05] them when they were born
[1:33:05] and they were born predestinated to a
[1:33:08] position
[1:33:09] in the kingdom we were born the exact
[1:33:13] same way
[1:33:14] you were born predestinated to a
[1:33:16] position
[1:33:18] and in that position we talked about the
[1:33:21] extreme
[1:33:21] effort that it would go into just to get
[1:33:23] the daily portion of meat to the king's
[1:33:25] table which was one of the things that
[1:33:27] that the queen of sheba saw that
[1:33:29] impressed her so much
[1:33:31] when she saw all this there was no more
[1:33:32] heart in there
[1:33:34] and every joint with supply what were we
[1:33:37] looking at we were looking at a
[1:33:38] at a church who had came through
[1:33:41] justification
[1:33:42] sanctification the baptism holy ghost
[1:33:44] moving into the promised land
[1:33:46] amen taking their position taking their
[1:33:48] land amen but then they had to come
[1:33:50] up to the word and then up to the
[1:33:52] manifestation of the word they had to
[1:33:53] come to the golden age
[1:33:55] under solomon's reign and every joint
[1:33:58] had to be supplying
[1:34:00] with no envy no strife no backbiting no
[1:34:03] hating no malice
[1:34:06] amen do you really do you really think
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:09] that we are in the position we need to
[1:34:11] be in if we've got hate
[1:34:13] and strife and backbiting and malice
[1:34:15] among us
[1:34:17] i say judgment begins at the house of
[1:34:19] god
[1:34:20] we need we need a solomon we need the
[1:34:22] holy ghost here
[1:34:24] we need the son of god son of david the
[1:34:27] son of man
[1:34:29] here to purge us of all of those things
[1:34:32] so that everybody could take their
[1:34:33] portion and then the queen of sheba
[1:34:34] looked there
[1:34:35] in second corinthians nine she looked
[1:34:37] and she says
[1:34:38] happy are your men happy
[1:34:41] are your servants
[1:34:44] they weren't like all i ever get to do
[1:34:46] is plow in the field
[1:34:50] sure wish i was a porter
[1:34:57] that's comical but
[1:35:00] we do the same thing sit in our houses
[1:35:03] sit in our seats and
[1:35:04] say well you know if god if god made me
[1:35:07] a trustee or something it would make me
[1:35:08] damn do something for him
[1:35:12] we may not even verbalize that but
[1:35:14] sometimes there's those the devil puts
[1:35:15] those thoughts there
[1:35:19] instead of just doing what comes natural
[1:35:22] just do what you do do what god's called
[1:35:25] you to it's ordained it's predestinated
[1:35:27] you can't miss it
[1:35:28] quit overthinking it quit thinking about
[1:35:30] it just rest
[1:35:32] just trust the lord just walk the walk a
[1:35:35] christian walk
[1:35:36] every day sanctify your life unto him
[1:35:38] every day ask him that preeminence in
[1:35:40] you
[1:35:40] and i guarantee you're going to go to
[1:35:42] places amen and do things for the lord
[1:35:44] that he's ordained for you to do
[1:35:46] and sometimes you may not even realize
[1:35:48] it but there may be times you're even
[1:35:49] surprised at what happens in your life
[1:35:53] you know when brother you know we're
[1:35:54] talking about adoption and placing
[1:35:56] and i'm not doing a very good job of
[1:35:57] getting to my subject but we're just
[1:35:58] going to preach anyways
[1:36:00] brother branham you know you're going to
[1:36:02] say when did brother ben come to
[1:36:03] adoption because we start to play these
[1:36:04] games what is adoption what
[1:36:06] you know when you finally hit your place
[1:36:08] when brother branham was called to
[1:36:09] ministry was he adopted
[1:36:12] you know i i'll say it this way
[1:36:16] i'll say it this way i think like
[1:36:18] everything else
[1:36:20] there's layers of revelation under
[1:36:22] adoption
[1:36:24] because really if we want to be truthful
[1:36:26] the true adoption for us is when we get
[1:36:28] a change in the body
[1:36:29] when he lifts us on high changes our
[1:36:31] garment says this is my sign
[1:36:33] amen that's going to be our true
[1:36:35] adoption
[1:36:36] but yet we've got to come to a
[1:36:37] positional place in adoption before then
[1:36:39] so so there's layers to adoption brother
[1:36:42] branham come
[1:36:43] and he become a minister he started
[1:36:44] revivals and he started preaching
[1:36:47] but then shortly after that he became a
[1:36:48] pastor and for a past he was a pastor
[1:36:50] for more than 10 years for
[1:36:52] for more like 14 15 years
[1:36:55] but then god called him from there
[1:36:58] and moved him to a worldwide evangelism
[1:37:02] healing ministry but that wasn't the
[1:37:04] destination but
[1:37:06] nowhere along you realize brother
[1:37:08] branham he just
[1:37:09] moved as god moved him as the door
[1:37:11] opened he walked he never had his eye
[1:37:13] set on any particular thing his goal
[1:37:16] wasn't any one thing
[1:37:17] he was never feeling like i haven't
[1:37:19] arrived because i'm not this
[1:37:21] i'm not doing anything again because i'm
[1:37:22] not there amen and then god would move
[1:37:24] him from that worldwide ministry and
[1:37:26] healing and healing ministry
[1:37:27] and then even moving to be the
[1:37:29] manifestation of the seventh angel
[1:37:32] to really his whole purpose in his life
[1:37:34] and maybe come into that manifestation
[1:37:36] at the opening of the seven seals and
[1:37:37] the preaching of the mystery
[1:37:40] what was he before what was he next
[1:37:43] what was he after i'll say it like this
[1:37:45] he was the son of god
[1:37:48] he was a son of god walking in the plan
[1:37:50] of god
[1:37:52] what i'm hoping to do is take away all
[1:37:54] this self analysis and
[1:37:56] position hunting and label seeking and
[1:37:59] just be a son and daughter of god
[1:38:01] with a life fully committed that
[1:38:03] whatever he's put in your hand
[1:38:04] whatever you find in your hand do it
[1:38:06] with all thy might
[1:38:10] if it's a daddy be a goddaddy
[1:38:13] if it's a mommy be a god mommy amen if
[1:38:16] god's opened the door for you to teach
[1:38:17] sunday school do with all your mind
[1:38:19] amen if god's asked you to be a deacon
[1:38:21] do it with all of your heart
[1:38:22] amen but don't forsake the mommy daddy
[1:38:24] thing too well not mommy daddy
[1:38:26] sorry we don't have deaconesses
[1:38:31] you see whatever he puts in your hand
[1:38:34] do it if it's to be a brother
[1:38:37] be a brother if it's to be a contributor
[1:38:40] be a contributor if it's to be part of
[1:38:42] the body
[1:38:43] if it's to encourage people with your
[1:38:44] presence encourage people with your
[1:38:46] presence
[1:38:48] you realize whatever god gives us to do
[1:38:51] do it with our might
[1:38:53] forget about the silly questions well
[1:38:56] what's your position
[1:38:58] next time somebody asks you that you say
[1:38:59] i don't know you tell me
[1:39:03] i'm in the body of christ i'm part of
[1:39:05] the body
[1:39:07] i want to read this last scripture and
[1:39:08] then we're going to slow down we're not
[1:39:09] even
[1:39:10] near where we're supposed to be but
[1:39:11] we're going to have to wind her down
[1:39:13] let's read ephesians 4
[1:39:16] and 11.
[1:39:20] and he gave some apostles and some
[1:39:22] prophets
[1:39:23] and some evangelists and some pastors
[1:39:25] and teachers
[1:39:28] now i talked about this a week or two
[1:39:30] ago but i i'd like to
[1:39:33] reemphasize this he didn't give the fifo
[1:39:36] ministry to be honored to be worshiped
[1:39:39] to be praised
[1:39:43] to be the ultimate of a christian
[1:39:45] experience on earth
[1:39:48] but he sent those gifts for a reason
[1:39:51] they had a specific purpose
[1:39:53] and that purpose was for the perfecting
[1:39:55] of the saints for the work of the
[1:39:57] ministry
[1:39:58] for the edifying of the body of christ
[1:40:00] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:40:02] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[1:40:04] god
[1:40:04] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:40:07] the stature of the formers of christ
[1:40:09] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:40:11] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:40:13] every wind of doctrine
[1:40:15] by the slight of men and the cunning
[1:40:17] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:40:18] deceive
[1:40:19] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:40:22] up into him in all things which is the
[1:40:23] head even christ
[1:40:25] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:40:27] together and compacted by that which
[1:40:29] every joint supplyeth
[1:40:31] according to the effectual working and
[1:40:33] the measure
[1:40:34] of every part making increase of the
[1:40:36] body unto the edifying
[1:40:38] of itself in love
[1:40:41] so what is the purpose of the fightful
[1:40:42] ministry
[1:40:44] to get the bride to the same shape
[1:40:47] israel was in when
[1:40:48] solomon was on the throne
[1:40:52] is that what the scripture says every
[1:40:55] joint supplies every knee
[1:40:59] every organ every cell every fiber
[1:41:02] every hair where all the body fitly
[1:41:05] joined together
[1:41:06] worketh together for love
[1:41:10] for the building up of the body of
[1:41:11] christ for the perfection of the saints
[1:41:14] amen to do away with all false notions
[1:41:16] false doctrines that create
[1:41:18] scare and hold back the body from
[1:41:20] expression that's what the fifo ministry
[1:41:22] is sent for
[1:41:22] the firefight ministry has sent amen to
[1:41:25] help the bride find her place
[1:41:27] to move into an adopted position amen
[1:41:30] where every joint supply
[1:41:32] and the body is functioning as one body
[1:41:35] so every mother every father every
[1:41:37] grandmother every aunt
[1:41:38] uncle sunday school teacher you name me
[1:41:40] whatever position every widow widower
[1:41:42] everybody amen they come into their own
[1:41:45] they find their position they get in
[1:41:47] harmony with the plan of god in their
[1:41:48] lives
[1:41:49] and everybody is a contributing member
[1:41:51] to everybody else
[1:41:53] and then you know what we'll see we'll
[1:41:55] see whatever the queen of sheba saw
[1:41:58] when she come into the kingdom of israel
[1:41:59] because israel had come to a golden age
[1:42:01] israel come to an adoption amen
[1:42:06] everybody's free if if my job if if i
[1:42:09] feel good encouraging somebody i'm free
[1:42:11] to encourage somebody
[1:42:12] and i'm free to say that's what god
[1:42:14] wants me to do
[1:42:16] not what does god want you i don't know
[1:42:17] what god wants me to do i don't know i
[1:42:19] mean
[1:42:20] just do what you do do what you do
[1:42:23] god will open the next door do what you
[1:42:26] love
[1:42:27] do what do what you see inspires people
[1:42:29] encourages people bless these people
[1:42:31] do what comes natural do what's in you
[1:42:34] let what's in you come out an expression
[1:42:36] and quit worrying about what you're
[1:42:37] supposed to be be what you are
[1:42:41] i hope that through teaching this that
[1:42:43] we can give people the freedom to be
[1:42:45] what they
[1:42:46] already are not seek to be something
[1:42:48] that they will
[1:42:49] never become
[1:42:52] no more frustration no more you know
[1:42:56] i remember uh
[1:42:59] sister mita her daughter rebecca told a
[1:43:01] story one time i think they wrote it in
[1:43:03] in one of the magazines i can't remember
[1:43:04] where i read it but she was talking
[1:43:06] about sister mita
[1:43:07] and sister media was always ironing
[1:43:09] ironing ironing and rebecca told her mom
[1:43:12] after she was grown me to come over to
[1:43:14] the house was helping her iron some
[1:43:15] stuff
[1:43:15] and she she told mom she said mom i'm so
[1:43:18] glad you enjoy ironing i just don't
[1:43:20] enjoy it
[1:43:21] and sister meter said who told you i
[1:43:23] enjoy ironing
[1:43:26] she said well you're always doing it and
[1:43:29] she told rebecca's story
[1:43:31] she said you know years ago when your
[1:43:34] daddy
[1:43:35] brother branham was in the ministry he
[1:43:38] said i saw all these other wives of
[1:43:40] these evangelical ministers they were
[1:43:41] always helping their husbands
[1:43:43] they're always planning events and
[1:43:44] planning dinners and doing this
[1:43:46] she said i couldn't do any of that and i
[1:43:48] used to feel so discouraged
[1:43:52] she says finally one day i was i was
[1:43:54] feeling low i was feeling discouraged i
[1:43:56] was ironing a shirt
[1:43:58] and she goes she was just talking to the
[1:44:00] lord she was just crying out lord i
[1:44:01] can't do like these other women i can't
[1:44:04] and somehow the lord led her to
[1:44:06] understand that she could pray
[1:44:08] and she said from that day on while she
[1:44:11] ironed brother branham shirts
[1:44:12] she would pray for him for the meetings
[1:44:15] for the ministry for god to protect him
[1:44:20] i tell you in eternity it may take
[1:44:23] eternity to realize the value of a
[1:44:25] wife's prayer
[1:44:26] over her husband did she did he need her
[1:44:30] to plan an event
[1:44:31] to have a lady's tea to get the
[1:44:34] ministering sisters together
[1:44:36] no he needed that quiet time while she
[1:44:39] was ironing a shirt praying for him
[1:44:42] and since then me to begin to pray for
[1:44:43] everybody sharing shirts for so when she
[1:44:45] volunteered to do rebecca's
[1:44:47] ironing for her family it was she was
[1:44:49] actually going into a ministry of
[1:44:51] intercessory prayer
[1:44:52] she wasn't worried about ironing shirts
[1:44:54] she was praying for everybody's garment
[1:44:56] of clothes
[1:44:57] who possessed his garment clothing
[1:45:01] you think did brother branham ever
[1:45:03] devalue meeta in any way
[1:45:05] no he said one time he said
[1:45:10] you know she never when she was getting
[1:45:12] when she was sick he was standing in the
[1:45:13] gap before he said lord you know
[1:45:15] she's never fussed one time i've been
[1:45:16] gone months at a time i'm meeting she's
[1:45:18] never fussed at me
[1:45:19] i'll come in and just get out from under
[1:45:21] the pressure i'll go on a hunt and trip
[1:45:22] her a fishing trip
[1:45:23] she always has my clothes back she
[1:45:24] always irons my shirt and she never says
[1:45:26] one thing about it
[1:45:28] and then brother brandon says and she
[1:45:29] wonders how she can serve the lord
[1:45:34] he says sisters as you serve your
[1:45:35] husbands you serve the lord
[1:45:39] that ironing a shirt that packing a bag
[1:45:43] that not saying anything it was a huge
[1:45:46] sacrifice for me to
[1:45:48] husband gone to month tending the
[1:45:49] children by herself that's how she got
[1:45:51] in trouble she was frustrated keeping
[1:45:53] the children while her husband was gone
[1:45:55] and said something sharp to brother
[1:45:56] branham slammed the door in his face
[1:45:58] and none of us would blame her
[1:46:01] but over and over silently stood by his
[1:46:05] side
[1:46:05] took what came i'd say she did exactly
[1:46:09] what she was supposed to do
[1:46:14] she was worried in herself i'm not like
[1:46:16] these other women they do this they do
[1:46:18] that
[1:46:19] they they they put together a tea they
[1:46:22] plan their husbands events they keep
[1:46:24] their husbands scheduled
[1:46:27] but i wonder how many of them stopped
[1:46:29] and prayed for his ministry
[1:46:33] which has greater value see sometimes we
[1:46:38] human beings we tend to gravitate
[1:46:40] towards the thing that gets noticed
[1:46:42] planning the
[1:46:44] the tea or having all the ministering
[1:46:46] sisters over
[1:46:48] it gets noticed i plan this i'm a good
[1:46:50] pastor's wife i'm a good minister's wife
[1:46:52] i play in this i did this and we had a
[1:46:53] ladies bible study and did this
[1:46:56] and sometimes all your husband needs all
[1:46:59] god wants you to do
[1:47:00] is iron that shirt and pray for your
[1:47:03] husband
[1:47:05] stay in your post of duty stay in your
[1:47:07] calling
[1:47:08] a mother who will clean home so her
[1:47:11] children are raised in a clean home
[1:47:13] and pray for her kids pray with her kids
[1:47:17] take the time just to stop take the time
[1:47:20] to be what god called her to be
[1:47:22] not try to be a mom the mom's not enough
[1:47:25] the world doesn't put enough value on
[1:47:26] mom i need to be a mom plus something
[1:47:28] else
[1:47:28] to have value in my life tell me what's
[1:47:31] greater value than raising a baby
[1:47:35] who can put greater value on that a
[1:47:38] father who goes to work every day and
[1:47:40] works so that he can provide for his
[1:47:42] family and all he does is go to work and
[1:47:44] come home
[1:47:44] but when he comes home he's got a happy
[1:47:46] wife and happy children
[1:47:47] they come to church holding hands and
[1:47:49] smiling
[1:47:51] you think that brother is not serving
[1:47:53] god i say he's serving god
[1:47:56] because when that family walks in the
[1:47:58] back door this church or walks into a
[1:48:01] walmart or goes and sits down
[1:48:02] and the kids are well behaved and
[1:48:04] they're happy and they talk to one
[1:48:05] another
[1:48:06] there's no phones on the table there's
[1:48:07] no games
[1:48:10] and a man shows his wife respect and a
[1:48:13] wife honors and reverences her husband
[1:48:14] and they truly love one another and they
[1:48:16] look at each other still with a spark in
[1:48:17] their eye
[1:48:18] and you can see the love and you can see
[1:48:20] the family you can see the harmony
[1:48:24] you know what the world sees jehovah
[1:48:27] the self-existing one who reveals
[1:48:30] himself god doesn't need all our efforts
[1:48:33] and all our
[1:48:34] this and that he just needs us to do
[1:48:36] what he's called us to do
[1:48:39] there's nothing wrong with with planning
[1:48:42] a
[1:48:43] this or that or having a fellowship
[1:48:45] those sometimes are the thing that god
[1:48:46] needs us to do
[1:48:47] sometimes god needs us to bring the
[1:48:49] people together sometimes god and he's
[1:48:51] called you to do that there's people
[1:48:52] here that are great at hosting
[1:48:54] families putting families together
[1:48:56] hosting people to have great fellowship
[1:48:57] there's people who are great at playing
[1:48:58] that's your gift that you're calling
[1:49:01] but don't ever feel like that what god
[1:49:03] has called me to do and what's in my
[1:49:05] hand
[1:49:05] isn't enough that sort of thinking
[1:49:09] doesn't come from god whatever god's put
[1:49:12] in your hand
[1:49:13] do it with your whole heart and if he
[1:49:16] wants you to do something else
[1:49:17] he'll give it to you he'll put it in
[1:49:19] your hand
[1:49:21] he was faithful in the least he'll be
[1:49:23] faithful and much
[1:49:25] but if we're not faithful in the least
[1:49:26] will we be faithful and much
[1:49:30] don't ever don't ever let the devil tell
[1:49:33] you
[1:49:33] that you're not doing something for the
[1:49:35] kingdom of god because i don't have a
[1:49:37] title
[1:49:38] i don't have an official church title
[1:49:41] there's some people that have had
[1:49:42] official church titles before they
[1:49:44] haven't done nothing for the kingdom of
[1:49:45] god
[1:49:46] but they were called a pastor or a
[1:49:49] minister an evangelist or a deacon
[1:49:51] and they didn't do a thing for the glory
[1:49:52] of god
[1:49:56] every step we take and every move we
[1:49:58] make be for him and not
[1:49:59] us let's just surrender ourselves to him
[1:50:03] and let's cry out for preeminence
[1:50:05] not a position not a work not a i'll
[1:50:07] feel good i'll tell you something right
[1:50:09] now friends it doesn't matter what
[1:50:10] position you move into
[1:50:13] it will never bring a satisfaction
[1:50:17] brother branham in 1960
[1:50:20] he's laying on his bed with his hands
[1:50:22] behind his head meditating
[1:50:24] he says well you're already 50 years old
[1:50:26] he says if you're going to do something
[1:50:28] for the lord you better start now
[1:50:32] do you think brother ben felt secure
[1:50:35] because he had had a worldwide ministry
[1:50:36] he felt satisfied
[1:50:38] he was ready for retirement he was done
[1:50:40] no those things
[1:50:41] never bring satisfaction to a believer
[1:50:43] the only thing brings satisfaction to
[1:50:45] believers that i'm doing all that he
[1:50:46] called me to do
[1:50:48] there's no settling down there's no
[1:50:50] achievement there's no getting to a
[1:50:51] certain station in life and plateauing
[1:50:53] there's always a desire of god what do
[1:50:55] you want now
[1:50:57] what's pleasing to you now what do you
[1:50:59] want me to do for you now
[1:51:02] if brother branham went through that do
[1:51:04] you think becoming a deacon will all of
[1:51:06] a sudden answer all your questions and
[1:51:07] now you'll never wonder anymore
[1:51:09] no sir do you think moving into this or
[1:51:13] getting asked that no
[1:51:14] you're always a christian is always
[1:51:16] going to be tore up all the time wanting
[1:51:18] to please the lord
[1:51:20] there's no arrival there's no
[1:51:22] achievement the only achievement is
[1:51:23] preeminence
[1:51:26] i say god have your way with me and make
[1:51:29] me
[1:51:31] a word brother a word
[1:51:34] sister a word member of the local body
[1:51:37] make me a word daddy a word mommy a word

[1:51:44] do
[1:51:45] you become the expression of christ in
[1:51:47] that thing
[1:51:50] and you know what you're going to find
[1:51:52] you're going to find yourself moving
[1:51:54] into adoption
[1:51:55] and not even realizing what's happening
[1:52:00] god before the foundation of the world
[1:52:03] he already knew what his works would be
[1:52:05] he's called us in christ jesus unto good
[1:52:07] works
[1:52:08] and he's ordained that we should walk in
[1:52:10] them what we need to do
[1:52:12] is just keep walking and be faithful in
[1:52:15] what he's given us to do
[1:52:18] let's all stand
[1:52:22] now i'm going to have an altar call
[1:52:29] may the lord may the lord deal with us
[1:52:31] each one in our hearts
[1:52:34] may the lord may this today be answering
[1:52:36] questions moving away fears moving away
[1:52:39] scares
[1:52:41] if we could just relax and say i'm all
[1:52:44] that god wants me to be
[1:52:47] if there's another place for me you'll
[1:52:49] move me to that place
[1:52:52] whatever you do whatever you do
[1:52:56] be the self-existing one who's revealing
[1:52:59] himself
[1:53:01] let god have preeminence let's bow our
[1:53:03] heads before we do

[1:53:27] adoption i pray that you'd make it real
[1:53:29] to us
[1:53:30] make it so simple lord lord the devil
[1:53:33] would make it complicated
[1:53:35] he would put things out of our reach and
[1:53:37] set goals that aren't yours and
[1:53:39] bring doubts about ourselves that aren't
[1:53:41] from you
[1:53:43] god i pray right now you begin to speak
[1:53:45] to every heart lord
[1:53:47] every mother every father every man
[1:53:49] every woman every single every
[1:53:51] grandparent
[1:53:52] wherever we find ourselves in life
[1:53:54] whether with a ministry or with a work
[1:53:57] whatever it is lord let us surrender in
[1:54:00] a greater way to you
[1:54:03] let us die to self in all strife and
[1:54:05] vain glory
[1:54:07] let us be happy with the portion that
[1:54:08] you've given us
[1:54:10] lord when you divided out the nation to
[1:54:13] israel
[1:54:14] ephraim had a portion and god had a
[1:54:17] portion and naftali had a portion
[1:54:19] and you gave him you gave him the right
[1:54:21] portion because it was a predestinated
[1:54:23] portion
[1:54:25] god it would have been a terrible thing
[1:54:27] for ephraim to complain
[1:54:29] or natalie or gad to complain
[1:54:32] god help us not to complain for you've
[1:54:35] designated a portion in your body for us
[1:54:38] a part of the word for us to manifest a
[1:54:41] section of scripture for us to make
[1:54:43] alive in our lives
[1:54:45] let us not grumble or complain or
[1:54:47] devalue what you hold so dear by asking
[1:54:50] for something else
[1:54:51] but help us lord to be faithful in what
[1:54:53] you put in our hands
[1:54:55] whatever it is may your word take
[1:54:56] preeminence maybe do it by your word
[1:54:59] according to your word the way you would
[1:55:01] do it on this earth
[1:55:02] may we as believers in this last time be
[1:55:05] jehovah on earth the self-existent one
[1:55:08] who's become a family
[1:55:10] who's revealed himself and individuals
[1:55:13] come together in a body
[1:55:15] may every joint supply may everyone find
[1:55:18] their portion and satisfaction in
[1:55:20] working their portion
[1:55:22] oh god how we love you how we need you
[1:55:24] lord
[1:55:26] god forgive us for selfishness
[1:55:29] forgive us lord for the wrong kind of
[1:55:31] desires and the wrong thinking we repent
[1:55:33] now lord
[1:55:34] we ask that you'd put us in the right
[1:55:36] frame of mind
[1:55:37] you've placed us so securely you've
[1:55:39] taken all fear away
[1:55:41] now lord give us that freedom to be what
[1:55:43] you've called us to be
[1:55:45] if it's an exhorter let it let them
[1:55:46] exhort if it's one with wisdom let them
[1:55:49] express
[1:55:49] wisdom to brothers and sisters if it's
