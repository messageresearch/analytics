[8:21] your spirit would catch the revelation
[8:22] of what you want to speak to us lord and
[8:24] that we would be established
[8:26] in this present truth god that that life
[8:29] of that word would live through us lord
[8:31] and we would become the manifestation in
[8:34] this hour
[8:35] when we yield ourselves to you we ask
[8:37] you to take control

[8:45] in jesus christ's name we pray
[8:47] amen
[8:49] amen god bless you what we're standing
[8:50] let's turn to the book of ephesians
[8:52] together
[8:54] and look at ephesians chapter 5
[8:57] together
[8:59] and just want to remind you that there
[9:01] will be a communion service and feet
[9:03] washing this afternoon
[9:05] so we don't want to forget that
[9:09] um
[9:11] also
[9:12] brother roshan messi will be coming in
[9:14] this week he'll be coming in on thursday
[9:16] and he'll be preaching for us on sunday
[9:19] so it's the first time that he's been
[9:21] able to get out since all the covert
[9:23] restrictions started so he's coming from
[9:24] india so we're really excited to have
[9:26] our brother back and and check up with
[9:28] him and see how he's doing he's actually
[9:30] going to be staying for almost a week so
[9:32] be preaching for us on sunday and on
[9:34] wednesday so i'm really happy to have
[9:37] our brother i also want to remind you
[9:39] that this wednesday
[9:41] we're going to start our tape service
[9:43] and the book we're going to be doing is
[9:44] god's power to transform there's a blue
[9:47] rack out here beside the welcome desk
[9:49] that has the book so you can get a book
[9:51] you can use your tablet you can use your
[9:52] phone or whatever but we'll start into
[9:54] that
[9:55] this coming wednesday so i don't want
[9:57] you to forget that
[9:59] let's read ephesians chapter 5
[10:02] verse 28
[10:09] so want men to love their wives as their
[10:11] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[10:13] loveth himself
[10:15] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[10:17] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[10:19] the lord the church
[10:21] for we are members of his body of his
[10:23] flesh and of his bones i love that
[10:26] scripture
[10:27] i mean it's so direct and it's so
[10:29] powerful it's so tangible it's so
[10:32] effective in this dimension this isn't a
[10:35] theory this is reality
[10:37] for we are members of his body of his
[10:40] flesh and of his bones for this cause
[10:42] shall a man leave his father and mother
[10:44] and shall be joined unto his wife
[10:46] and they too shall be one flesh
[10:48] this is a great mystery but i speak
[10:50] concerning christ and the church
[10:53] amen god bless you
[10:55] amen as you're seated may the lord bless
[10:58] the reading of his word and
[11:02] this is something that is a reality
[11:05] that is for us to realize in this age
[11:07] that we live in
[11:09] that we are members of his body of his
[11:11] flesh and of his bones
[11:14] so you know the apostle paul and and
[11:17] peter and the different ones the
[11:19] apostles in the new testament as they're
[11:21] giving out the word you realize uh i
[11:24] realize as i meditate on this that the
[11:27] apostle paul
[11:28] never wrote an epistle never preached
[11:31] anything so that it it would be included
[11:34] in the bible and be put on print so that
[11:36] we could have it in a book
[11:38] now god purposed that so that we'd have
[11:40] it at the end time but the apostle paul
[11:42] preached so that that word would live in
[11:44] somebody amen
[11:46] and god allowed it to be put into print
[11:48] and to be collected for the end time
[11:50] when there would be a full manifestation
[11:52] of all that paul taught amen so that we
[11:54] could read that but paul didn't paul
[11:57] didn't want
[11:58] i should say this way paul didn't want
[12:00] to write a bible amen paul wanted to
[12:02] make living epistles amen
[12:05] the people to be the word he preached so
[12:08] that that preaching would manifest in a
[12:10] people amen and that's the day that we
[12:12] live in when all that has been preached
[12:14] and all that has been taught and all the
[12:16] shadows and all the types come into
[12:18] manifestation in a people amen and the
[12:21] bride
[12:23] if you could turn with me to colossians
[12:24] chapter one
[12:26] we'll grab another scripture here
[12:33] colossians
[12:36] chapter 1 and verse 18.
[12:42] and he is the head of the body the
[12:45] church
[12:46] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[12:48] the dead that in all things he might
[12:51] have the preeminence
[12:53] so we know that the church is his body
[12:56] amen in a physical way upon this earth
[12:59] she is his body and he is the head and
[13:02] so we've talked about that so much and
[13:04] brother branham brought that to us that
[13:06] the headship had united with the body at
[13:08] the end time
[13:09] and for a title i wanted to take for a
[13:12] text he that is in her
[13:15] he that is in her and we'll just see
[13:18] how we go this day
[13:20] and the spoken word is the original seed
[13:23] the prophet says christ was manifested
[13:25] to destroy the works of the devil
[13:28] you believe that now i can't explain all
[13:29] this i'm just going to go through it
[13:31] just quickly now hit the high places so
[13:33] you won't stay too long christ was
[13:36] manifested to destroy the works of the
[13:37] devil is that right you all believe that
[13:41] what was he god's word which destroys
[13:44] the works of the hybrid devil so what is
[13:47] it that destroys the devil the word amen
[13:50] so what was christ he was the word made
[13:52] flesh so he was manifest to destroy the
[13:55] works of the devil so it was the word of
[13:57] god amen when it came into manifestation
[14:01] was the dare to destroy the works of the
[14:02] devil in the works of the devil was the
[14:04] hybridization of the word
[14:07] amen
[14:08] so the word made flesh the word coming
[14:10] into manifestation is to destroy the
[14:12] works of the devil
[14:15] he he was done to do that he was born to
[14:17] do that to destroy the works of the
[14:19] devil now his body is to do the same
[14:23] because the body is head and body is
[14:25] together that right if christ is the
[14:28] head was the word his body has to be the
[14:30] same thing as his head was that's right
[14:33] a church of the word born of the word
[14:35] virgin born from the word so the word
[14:39] church the bride that is the word she is
[14:42] manifest to destroy the works of the
[14:43] devil because she is the word made flesh
[14:48] let's go to first john
[14:51] i just want to lay in some of these
[14:52] scriptures
[14:54] i've got quite a few quotes that i want
[14:56] to read i want to lay in these
[14:57] scriptures and i want to move quickly
[14:58] through these and get to a main thought
[15:01] that i've been meditating on
[15:03] first john 4 4.
[15:08] first john chapter 4 and verse 4.
[15:12] ye are of god little children and have
[15:14] overcome them
[15:16] because greater is he that is in you
[15:19] than he that is in the world
[15:21] now the prophet god is going to go to
[15:23] the scripture and refer to this and he
[15:25] says may i read it again and this is the
[15:27] message he that is in you
[15:30] year of god little children and overcome
[15:32] them and and the prophet of god
[15:34] interjects here talking of the
[15:36] antichrist so he says you've overcome
[15:38] them you've overcome those that are
[15:40] influenced by the antichrist or those
[15:42] under the antichrist spirit you have
[15:44] overcome them talking of the antichrist
[15:46] because greater is he that's in you than
[15:48] he that's in the world
[15:50] two pronouns see he personal pronoun he
[15:54] that is in the world he that is in you
[15:56] he that is in you is greater than he
[15:58] that's in the world amen so there's two
[16:01] he's amen the he that's in you is christ
[16:04] and he that's in the world is the
[16:05] antichrist and he that's in you is
[16:07] greater than he that's in the world
[16:10] amen
[16:12] i think it's interesting to see how
[16:14] crazy things are getting in the world
[16:16] and how out of control things have
[16:18] gotten and are continuing to get amen
[16:21] and it seems like amen every evil thing
[16:24] is on the rampage and wickedness on
[16:26] every corner amen but we must remember
[16:28] that he that is in us is greater than he
[16:30] that's in the world so if he that's in
[16:32] the world as having greater control of
[16:35] all finances of all politics of of of
[16:38] everything and immorality and sin amen
[16:42] in in
[16:44] church politics and religious deceit if
[16:48] it's going off the charts amen as as he
[16:51] that's in the world has gained more and
[16:53] more power then we have to always
[16:55] realize he that's in you is greater than
[16:57] he that's in the world
[16:59] so
[17:00] it can never the power of antichrist
[17:04] being manifest and the world can day can
[17:06] never overpower he that's in you
[17:10] and this is so important for us to
[17:12] remember it's not that we haven't heard
[17:14] these things and we don't know these
[17:15] things but we still live in a body of
[17:17] flesh and we live in a
[17:20] an atmosphere that is contrary to the
[17:22] word of god and we must be reminded over
[17:25] and over and over again that he that is
[17:27] in you is greater than he that's in the
[17:29] world
[17:30] so he that's in the world will never
[17:32] conquer he that's in you
[17:35] so it can never get so bad
[17:37] amen that god will still not overcome by
[17:40] his manifested word
[17:43] it'll never it'll never overpower christ
[17:48] never
[17:49] let's go to colossians
[17:51] chapter one
[18:03] colossians chapter 1
[18:05] and now let's go further down into verse
[18:07] 26.
[18:11] even the mystery which has been hid from
[18:13] ages and from generation but now is made
[18:15] manifest to saints
[18:17] to whom god would make known what is the
[18:19] riches of the glory of this mystery
[18:21] among the gentiles which is christ in
[18:23] you the hope of glory
[18:25] i read that scripture so many times when
[18:27] i preach but it is our scripture amen it
[18:30] is the time for the realization of this
[18:32] the revelation to hit home and to move
[18:35] into manifestation because this is the
[18:37] great mystery that's to be made known
[18:39] among the gentiles christ in you the
[18:41] hope of glory greater is he that's in
[18:43] you than he that's in the world
[18:47] in the message calling jesus on the
[18:49] scene the prophet says now you say how
[18:52] could he be god and be man see there is
[18:55] the mystery see in body he was man in
[18:58] spirit he was god see
[18:59] someone asked me he said then how did
[19:02] how who did he pray to in the garden of
[19:04] gethsemane
[19:07] i said i'll answer you that when you
[19:08] answer this
[19:11] do you believe you have the holy ghost
[19:13] they answered yes
[19:15] i said then who do you pray to
[19:18] where is he at when you pray to him
[19:21] when you claim you have him and yet
[19:23] you're praying to him
[19:26] they were trying to to to you know
[19:28] disprove the deity of jesus christ and
[19:31] they say well who did he pray to in the
[19:33] garden of gethsemane and and brother
[19:35] branham just just the same way that
[19:37] jesus christ did to the pharisees he
[19:39] said well i'll ask you one question
[19:43] do you have the holy ghost yes
[19:46] then who do you pray to when you pray
[19:49] amen see if if the devil can get us into
[19:52] spiritual amnesia and we can forget amen
[19:55] who it is that dwells in us if we forget
[19:58] who has been restored in this day who
[20:00] has come back to unite with the church
[20:02] amen and we make it a minor thing
[20:05] instead of the major thing that it is
[20:07] amen then the devil begins to strip us
[20:10] amen of the power that has come in this
[20:12] day the revelation and realization of
[20:15] who it is that is coming to the bride
[20:19] and then when we get into hours of
[20:21] distress and hours of trouble and in
[20:23] times of agony and anxiety amen we begin
[20:26] to call out as if god is far away amen
[20:30] we begin to cry oh god come and help me
[20:33] o god who who is far far away from me
[20:36] right now amen and that is a reverse
[20:39] back into spiritual amnesia that is
[20:41] going backwards in denominationalism
[20:43] amen but god amen has come down to
[20:46] headship is coming united with the bride
[20:48] and through the baptism of the holy
[20:50] ghost it's greater than he that's in you
[20:52] than he that's in the world and he
[20:53] hasn't come to you to leave you he's
[20:55] come to stay
[20:58] and so there's no crying out to a god
[21:00] who's a million miles away amen there is
[21:03] a present tense god dwelling with this
[21:06] bride and he's not leaving her
[21:10] it doesn't mean that your faith will not
[21:12] be tested it doesn't mean that god will
[21:14] be quiet amen so that you your faith can
[21:17] come to the forefront and the faith
[21:19] that's in you can can take the word and
[21:21] overcome by the word amen you may not
[21:24] feel his presence but it doesn't change
[21:26] his dwelling place
[21:30] these things we we have to be reminded
[21:32] of all the time because if you're not in
[21:34] a stressful situation and you haven't
[21:36] felt anxiety for a few days just hold on
[21:38] because it's coming
[21:41] because he he loves to test his children
[21:44] he loves to prove his bride
[21:48] and so we have to remember the
[21:50] scriptures
[21:52] we have to believe the word
[21:55] and understand that we live in the day
[21:57] that all this word is being fulfilled
[22:01] let's go to first corinthians 6.
[22:12] first corinthians chapter 6
[22:17] and verse 19.
[22:23] what know you not that your body is the
[22:26] temple of the holy ghost
[22:27] which is in you
[22:29] which you have of god
[22:31] and you are not your own
[22:34] your body is the temple
[22:37] of the holy ghost
[22:40] you're templing
[22:41] christ
[22:43] he's with you his spirit is inside of
[22:46] you let's go over to ephesians chapter
[22:49] 2.
[23:03] and let's look at verse 19 ephesians
[23:05] chapter 2
[23:06] verse 19
[23:08] now therefore you are no more strangers
[23:10] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[23:12] the saints and of the household of god
[23:14] and are built upon the foundation of the
[23:16] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[23:18] himself being the chief cornerstone
[23:21] in whom all the buildings fitly framed
[23:23] together groweth unto a holy temple in
[23:25] the lord in whom ye also are builded
[23:28] together for a habitation of god through
[23:31] the spirit
[23:33] so
[23:34] where is the god that we're praying to
[23:35] you
[23:37] where is christ in this hour where is
[23:40] this great holy spirit that is returned
[23:42] in full measure to the bride he is in
[23:44] the bride amen he's here he's with us
[23:46] he's in us friends
[23:49] he's not uh he's not left us he didn't
[23:52] he wasn't just here amen to show us that
[23:55] he was here and do mighty works to the
[23:57] prophet and then take off and vanish but
[23:59] he's here he's he's here in fullness the
[24:02] fullness of the word has brought back
[24:04] the fullness of the spirit because the
[24:06] word is the spirit and life
[24:09] so the full spirit in life is here with
[24:11] the full word and he's not and then he's
[24:14] not coming and going he's here friends
[24:16] he's here with the bride amen greater is
[24:19] he that's in you than he that's in the
[24:20] world there's nothing to be afraid of
[24:23] amen there's tragedy that comes yes
[24:26] there's difficulties that come and will
[24:28] come
[24:29] the bible says man that is born of a
[24:31] woman is a few days and full of trouble
[24:33] that's the truth
[24:35] amen but it's also true that he said
[24:38] i'll never leave you nor forsake you but
[24:40] i'll be with you even unto the end of
[24:42] the world he's with us amen amen when we
[24:45] get into tragedy we get into trouble in
[24:47] difficult circumstances we have to
[24:49] remember i'm not screaming and crying
[24:52] and stomping for a god that's a million
[24:54] miles away amen he knows my thoughts
[24:57] amen he knows my whispered prayer he
[24:59] knows what i'm saying in the sincerity
[25:02] of my heart amen but he's with me and
[25:04] and i don't want to start talking to him
[25:06] as if he is far away amen i want to
[25:09] start talking to the one that's closer
[25:11] than a brother
[25:16] amen because
[25:17] what happens many times when we get into
[25:20] trouble and we get into circumstances
[25:22] and situations
[25:24] amen the way that we respond to that
[25:27] situation
[25:29] is actually straining the relationship
[25:33] between us and christ
[25:35] not on his part but on our part
[25:38] he never left he never moved but in our
[25:41] own mentality we put him away amen we
[25:44] put him far away he's distance in our
[25:47] mind in our understanding we've
[25:49] distanced him from ourselves and our
[25:51] trial and our situation and we've put a
[25:53] strain on the relationship and hindered
[25:56] our faith
[25:58] just by the way we speak
[26:01] man if we would just catch the
[26:03] revelation that's coming this hour and
[26:05] hold to it in the face of trial on the
[26:08] worst day when the world is crashing
[26:10] down all around us and everything is
[26:12] falling apart if we could stick with the
[26:15] revelation the same way we have it on
[26:17] our best day
[26:18] i said god is with me god is in me he
[26:21] knows the way that i take i'm in his
[26:23] hand i'll never be separated from him
[26:25] amen if you we can take that same
[26:27] approach in the midst of our worst
[26:29] trouble amen we'll see that our faith
[26:31] will not falter at the hour of trial
[26:35] many times our faith is hindered by the
[26:37] way we speak
[26:40] we hinder ourselves by the attitude we
[26:42] take
[26:44] and we don't speak by revelation we
[26:46] begin to speak by fear we begin to speak
[26:48] by anxiety and all these human emotions
[26:51] hey you're going to have human emotions
[26:53] you're not going to be able to stop the
[26:54] human emotions from coming as long as
[26:56] you live in this body in this condition
[26:59] the emotions will come but there's got
[27:01] to be something deeper than the emotions
[27:03] a reality that says wait a minute
[27:05] nothing's changed with me in god
[27:09] i'm tense i'm nervous i'm fearful i i
[27:12] have all of these crazy emotions going
[27:14] on all around me amen but i'm going to
[27:17] stop long enough to say i still believe
[27:19] the word is true that i am tabernacling
[27:23] the holy ghost that the holy spirit has
[27:25] not left me
[27:27] that i'm still the temple i'm still part
[27:29] of the habitation of god i'm still one
[27:31] of those lively stones he's still with
[27:33] me i'm still in his hand and there's
[27:35] nothing he's not further away today than
[27:38] he was in church on sunday
[27:44] amen listen there's been times that we
[27:48] needed this teaching there's times
[27:49] coming that we're going to need to
[27:51] remember this
[27:54] we have to pray
[27:56] that we can speak faith speak the
[27:59] revelation let it come out of our mouths
[28:04] the prophet of god tells us in christ as
[28:06] the mystery of god revealed
[28:08] he said then our headship is a kingdom
[28:11] the kingdom of god is within you
[28:14] so the bible jesus the kingdom
[28:17] we are not a denomination we belong to a
[28:19] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[28:21] god made spirit and life in our own life
[28:23] bringing to pass every promise in this
[28:25] day as it did in that day when the word
[28:28] and god was won
[28:29] and the word of god is one in his church
[28:32] today making it the headship of the body
[28:34] that is redeemed to bring the message in
[28:37] the last day and be taken up from the
[28:39] dead in the resurrection to go back and
[28:41] restore again as adam and eve in the
[28:43] beginning in the garden of eden the
[28:46] threefold mystery of god his body
[28:49] what's the threefold mystery of god his
[28:51] body
[28:52] what's his body jesus christ and jesus
[28:55] christ body is the church
[28:57] she's the completion of the finishing of
[28:59] the body of christ because as adam was
[29:02] completed in male and female jesus
[29:04] christ is completed in male and female
[29:06] so the church is the body of christ
[29:08] according to the word and she is
[29:10] completing or finishing the body of
[29:12] jesus christ which is the body of god
[29:14] which is the restoration of the
[29:16] threefold purpose for god to come down
[29:18] tangible and flesh and dwell amongst his
[29:22] attributes
[29:23] that is the threefold plan of god you're
[29:26] part of that
[29:27] that's not just a doctrine to say amen
[29:30] to on sunday
[29:32] that's a reality that'll hold you when
[29:35] everything's going wrong in your life
[29:38] paul didn't preach these things to the
[29:40] church so that they would write them in
[29:41] a bible and we would say well look
[29:43] that's what paul said amen paul said it
[29:46] so it'll be fleshed out amen so to be
[29:48] lived and the message didn't come so we
[29:50] can say wow what a revelation wow if you
[29:53] can believe that look at the things that
[29:55] brother branham was able no the message
[29:57] came so the message would be flesh in
[29:59] you amen so that this reality would not
[30:02] fade away from the bride
[30:04] yes
[30:06] and the message when their eyes were
[30:07] open they knew him he says and the whole
[30:09] thing is god unfolding himself and his
[30:12] attributes and then god being made
[30:14] material tangible and we can talk to
[30:17] speak with in his whole church body and
[30:21] everything
[30:23] we can talk to and speak with god
[30:27] how when we fellowship with one another
[30:32] because the whole plan was for god to
[30:34] become tangible
[30:37] god unfolding himself in his attributes
[30:40] and then god being made material
[30:43] tangible how is he doing it he's doing
[30:46] it in his church
[30:54] i want to read the god being made
[30:56] material tangible that we can talk to
[30:58] speak with
[31:00] in his whole church body in
[31:02] everything
[31:04] amen you know how it is when
[31:07] you get into some tight spots and you
[31:09] get into some trouble amen the devil
[31:11] always wants to move you off into
[31:13] isolation amen because separating you
[31:15] from the body is separating you from god
[31:20] because we can talk to
[31:23] talk with speak with
[31:25] god
[31:26] tangible in flesh
[31:28] and that fellowship will give us
[31:30] strength and encourage us god is not far
[31:33] away
[31:34] god is all around us
[31:36] he's within us and around us amen that's
[31:39] why the fellowship of saints is so
[31:40] critical amen to the christian faith
[31:42] through the christian wong amen because
[31:44] god is in his people
[31:47] therefore your name was in his thinking
[31:49] that's how you have eternal life you
[31:51] can't have it no other way if you got
[31:53] eternal life you always was
[31:57] and the masterpiece message the prophet
[31:58] of god says and then come finally the
[32:01] great head the head of it all the rest
[32:03] of the body just spoke of it the
[32:05] foundation was laid by the patriarch but
[32:07] the body was built by the word which was
[32:09] the prophets
[32:10] the prophet of god is speaking of the
[32:12] rebuilding of the masterpiece in the old
[32:14] testament the restoration of adam he
[32:16] said it was it was built started being
[32:18] built back by the patriarchs and then
[32:20] the body was built by the word which was
[32:22] the prophets
[32:23] and here comes the head of it here comes
[32:25] the head of all of it jesus came on the
[32:28] scene
[32:30] there when his headpiece was put on it
[32:32] we find in him the entire handiwork of
[32:34] god we find in him the perfect
[32:36] reflection of the word for he was the
[32:38] word and the fullness of the word now
[32:40] again god has the perfect masterpiece
[32:44] again
[32:45] so he's typing the rebuilding of the
[32:48] body of christ
[32:50] through the old testament is rebuilding
[32:52] the masterpiece rebuilding the sun that
[32:54] fell because adam was the son of god
[32:56] that had fallen now there's building
[32:58] back a body a son of god but but all of
[33:01] it was painting the picture of christ
[33:03] every
[33:04] prophet they were all pointing towards
[33:06] christ amen all the patriarchs they were
[33:08] pointing towards christ and here he
[33:10] comes as the headship on top of all of
[33:12] that body amen when he came in flash he
[33:15] was the headship he was the headstone
[33:18] capping it off and in him was the
[33:19] fullness of all of that manifestation
[33:24] god had restored that masterpiece
[33:26] but then he goes on to say christ is the
[33:28] mystery of god revealed
[33:30] and to be sure that the whole rapture
[33:32] now luther was a part wesley was a part
[33:34] the prophets was apart
[33:36] if they aren't apart just in the
[33:37] revelation that they was making up the
[33:39] body feet toes arms and so forth until
[33:42] the head which we get to that in a few
[33:44] minutes see that makes the entire
[33:46] rapture it's the body of the word which
[33:49] is christ
[33:51] so the the new testament has been
[33:53] building another body and we've talked
[33:55] about this many times it's the body of
[33:57] the church of the bride of jesus christ
[34:01] but he says in the voice of the sign now
[34:03] if the lord jesus christ the son of god
[34:05] whom i have proven by the bible promised
[34:08] that he would return in the last days
[34:10] and reveal himself in the fullness of
[34:12] his spirit just like the church coming
[34:14] up like it comes from a human being all
[34:16] the way from the feet comes up the
[34:18] thighs up to the head and the head is
[34:20] the head of the body and the body has
[34:23] come up ever since that first church
[34:25] come right on up this and the
[34:26] reformations has come up till now it's
[34:29] come through justification
[34:30] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[34:33] now it's the head christ coming to the
[34:36] body the body of christ
[34:40] and modern events made clear by prophecy
[34:42] he says but he said i'll meet them in
[34:44] one place the place i put my name that's
[34:47] in jesus christ that's where god put his
[34:49] name that's the only place he'll meet
[34:51] you and it's christ is the word the same
[34:53] yesterday it's growed from the feet
[34:56] thighs and now it's in the head fixing
[34:59] to go
[35:00] manifesting in full measure the bride
[35:03] the same as the groom
[35:06] i'm reading these quotes to show you
[35:08] that at the end of the church ages when
[35:10] god is building back a bride he's going
[35:12] to cap that bride off with the headship
[35:14] with jesus christ himself
[35:17] but that headship amen is going to be a
[35:21] unification of the word with the bride
[35:24] not something separate but you'll see
[35:26] the head in the bride the headship is
[35:29] coming to the body to the bride in the
[35:32] end time which will be another capstone
[35:34] not capping off the old testament but
[35:36] now capping off the new testament which
[35:38] will be the new testament in fullness in
[35:40] his body in the bride the headstone and
[35:43] the body united together as one
[35:46] do we believe that
[35:48] then let's act like we believe that
[35:51] i'm speaking to myself now
[35:53] we believe it we can say amen to it
[35:55] something in us cries out that that's
[35:57] the truth amen but but that must relate
[36:00] into a life a life amen that there's a
[36:03] confidence that the things that we've
[36:04] been taught are absolutely thus saith
[36:06] the lord amen they're not ideas amen
[36:09] they're realities amen they're not
[36:11] concepts they are the truth amen they
[36:13] are not they are not spiritual things
[36:15] amen that stay spiritual things but
[36:17] they're spiritual things that are
[36:18] manifested in fleshly things
[36:21] there is a reality to the things that
[36:23] we're preaching and the reality is that
[36:25] christ the headship has come into the
[36:28] body and now if you want to see christ
[36:31] where is christ dwelling christ is
[36:33] dwelling in his bride that is the
[36:35] capstone ministry that is the capping of
[36:38] the old testament the headship is in the
[36:40] body
[36:42] amen and if that's true greater is he
[36:45] that's in you than he that's in the
[36:46] world greater than any other time in
[36:49] history the manifestation the revelation
[36:52] has come to such a full measure amen
[36:54] that we should know these things we
[36:56] should be so rooted and so grounded in
[36:58] these things that we can overcome the
[37:00] most wicked of all ages
[37:03] and who knows what comes next
[37:06] really who knows what comes next
[37:09] who knows what kind of trouble what kind
[37:11] of danger what kind of hardship who
[37:13] knows what comes next amen uh i grew up
[37:17] all my life in the united states of
[37:19] america that was safe
[37:22] all my life
[37:24] amen but
[37:25] i don't think it's safe anymore
[37:28] it's certainly not as insulated and
[37:31] protected as it was when i was a boy
[37:35] there's trouble all around
[37:38] trouble's not only far away anymore
[37:41] trouble's nearby
[37:44] but it doesn't change the message
[37:48] it doesn't change the reality
[37:50] of what is materializing in this day
[37:57] again in modern events made clear by
[37:59] prophecy
[38:01] he said i'll meet them and i already
[38:03] read that
[38:06] jehovah jireh part 1
[38:08] now remember that christ is risen from
[38:10] the dead and is among us
[38:12] and get that in your mind christ raised
[38:14] from the dead and is among us
[38:17] now we have seen all kinds of great
[38:19] moves and shoutings and praising god all
[38:21] fine we've spoken tongues and prophesied
[38:23] and all we've seen all that that's fine
[38:26] that comes right along with it but
[38:28] remember the last thing is his divine
[38:31] presence
[38:33] the word itself
[38:36] you know when i come to the pulpit we
[38:38] were singing that song surely the
[38:39] presence of the lord is in this place
[38:41] what i'll tell you his presence is only
[38:43] here if his word is here
[38:46] we can have a sensation or a feeling a
[38:48] tingling we can have all kinds of
[38:50] emotions that move on our flesh but his
[38:53] presence is only here if the word is
[38:55] here
[38:57] the deception that was in the
[38:58] pentecostal age that moved through was
[39:00] that the experiences and the sensations
[39:03] were his presence and although his
[39:05] presence can come with sensation and
[39:07] experiences his
[39:09] experiences alone do not denote his
[39:12] presence sensation alone does not denote
[39:15] his presence but his presence is here
[39:18] when his word is here
[39:21] and you don't have to feel anything for
[39:23] that to be true
[39:28] this is something that's so important
[39:30] because if not we'll get caught back up
[39:32] in pentecostalism where we're always
[39:35] seeking another feeling another feeling
[39:36] another feeling and we'll leave the word
[39:39] for a feeling
[39:43] and then when we've left the word for a
[39:45] feeling we'll call it the presence of
[39:48] the lord
[39:53] but brother branham said that remember
[39:54] the last thing
[39:56] is his divine presence the word itself
[40:00] he is the word the head the word it's
[40:03] coming to the body
[40:05] the last thing is the divine presence of
[40:08] god
[40:09] which is the word itself
[40:12] and so
[40:15] in order to have the divine presence
[40:18] you must have the word
[40:20] and when you have the divine presence
[40:23] you may or may not have a feeling
[40:28] and sometimes when we get into our
[40:30] testing time now do you believe that the
[40:32] bride has to be tested
[40:35] do you believe that there's trials
[40:36] tribulations and tests that wait for
[40:38] each one of us
[40:40] sometimes when we get into our testing
[40:41] time
[40:42] amen we won't feel anything
[40:46] we actually will feel negative things
[40:50] our body will send us negative signals
[40:52] of fear and anxiety and all kinds of
[40:55] things will hit our body and we won't
[40:58] feel what we call the presence of the
[41:00] lord
[41:02] we'll feel nothing we'll just feel fear
[41:03] we'll feel anxiety we'll fear we'll feel
[41:06] all kinds of feelings amen and we if
[41:09] we're not grounded on the word and the
[41:11] word only and we're too uh dependent
[41:14] upon feelings and sensations we'll begin
[41:17] to feel like we're alone
[41:20] and god's not with us
[41:22] we'll begin to feel like god's not near
[41:26] we'll begin to feel
[41:29] more panicked like like god's not in
[41:31] this
[41:32] trial hey
[41:34] if you've been born again by the spirit
[41:36] of god and you're in the trial god's in
[41:38] the trial
[41:39] because god's in you not not coming to
[41:42] you to leave you coming you but he'll
[41:44] not allow amen because you have to go
[41:47] through the testing amen god is not
[41:50] sometimes going to allow the feelings
[41:52] amen amen he's not even sometimes going
[41:55] to speak to you
[41:59] have you ever had god go silent on you
[42:04] and when god goes silent on you and when
[42:06] you need him the most
[42:09] it feels like sometimes when you
[42:10] desperately need him the most god goes
[42:13] silent
[42:15] and if we if we are stuck in
[42:18] denominationalism
[42:20] we will feel like god's not in this
[42:22] trial we're all alone uh uh
[42:25] something is bad wrong amen but
[42:28] nothing's wrong you have to go through a
[42:30] testing amen and to go through a testing
[42:32] he's not going to make everything easy
[42:34] for you that's no test amen you have to
[42:37] go and he'll pull the feelings away he
[42:39] won't even speak to you amen why because
[42:42] the bride has to learn to operate on the
[42:44] word and the word only
[42:47] this bride has got to be able to stand
[42:51] on the word amen
[42:55] now
[42:57] i don't want anybody in any way to
[42:59] misunderstand me i want to feel his
[43:02] presence
[43:04] do you want to feel his presence
[43:06] i want to i want to feel it in a
[43:08] tangible way i want him to speak to me
[43:10] amen i want god to make his will amen so
[43:14] real to me that i know exactly what he
[43:16] wants me to do i want him to speak to me
[43:17] in prayer i want to feel his presence i
[43:20] want the sensation that comes from
[43:22] knowing that god is speaking in this
[43:24] moment and the thrill that thrills my
[43:26] soul i want all of that i want it in the
[43:28] services i want it in my prayer life i
[43:29] mean i want it in the dynamics of
[43:31] preaching i want it all
[43:34] but i am not i do not want to be so
[43:38] dependent on those things that i will
[43:41] question where god is in the midst of a
[43:43] trial because i become so dependent on
[43:46] those things to make me believe that
[43:48] he's here when i can't just take his
[43:51] word when he promised to be here that
[43:53] has to be enough for me
[43:55] he said i'll never leave you i believe
[43:58] it amen he said no man will pluck you
[44:00] from my hand i believe it amen when i
[44:03] feel nothing i believe it when he's not
[44:05] speaking i still believe it it's an
[44:08] exercise we have to exercise our faith
[44:10] and believe it in the face of all
[44:12] obstacles faith is the thing that
[44:14] overcomes amen this is the victory that
[44:16] overcome with the world even our faith
[44:21] so god will train our faith
[44:24] and the devil will train us to seek
[44:27] sensations to rob us of faith
[44:35] but feeling or no feeling the message is
[44:37] true
[44:41] feeling or no feeling the scriptures
[44:43] haven't changed
[44:46] feelings are such a fickle thing
[44:50] i've had such
[44:52] i've had some wonderful times with the
[44:54] lord
[44:55] that were so incredibly special to me
[44:59] that i wish i could live in that
[45:00] atmosphere always
[45:02] supernatural things the lord has done to
[45:04] me ways that he made his presence known
[45:06] and spoke to me
[45:09] and it felt wonderful
[45:11] and i felt like a son of god
[45:15] i felt like part of the bride i felt so
[45:17] connected to god
[45:20] and sometimes hours later or a day later
[45:23] i feel so opposite to that feeling
[45:30] you cannot we cannot rely on those
[45:32] things we must rely upon the word
[45:37] the last thing is his divine presence
[45:40] the word itself i said that again
[45:42] because i i want it to sink in so deep
[45:45] what has come
[45:46] his divine presence have come
[45:48] how's it come
[45:50] it's come with the fullness of the word
[45:54] the word itself
[45:56] he is the word the head the word it's
[45:58] coming to the body
[46:00] and the message the sign of this time he
[46:02] says now that's the same thing that
[46:04] constitutes a new birth water blood
[46:06] spirit the elements that come from his
[46:07] body is what makes his body see it comes
[46:10] from the body is the material that that
[46:13] that takes to make his bride because
[46:15] adam and his bride
[46:17] adam had his bride taken from his body
[46:19] christ has his bride taken from his body
[46:22] and when christ died there was three
[46:23] elements that came from his body water
[46:26] blood spirit justification through
[46:28] believing water sanctification through
[46:31] the blood the baptism of the holy spirit
[46:34] now this last great step must come into
[46:36] perfection that the holy spirit has to
[46:39] live in that church so perfectly it'll
[46:42] make the head and body unite together
[46:44] see that's the body he is the head in
[46:47] the body
[46:49] i like the way brother brim said that
[46:51] he is the head in the body
[46:54] where is the head well the head has come
[46:56] down to unite with the body if you say
[46:58] that the head has come down to unite to
[47:00] the body i can have the head separate
[47:02] from the body
[47:04] just that terminology in our minds the
[47:06] head has come down to unite from the
[47:08] body no the head has come to unite with
[47:11] the body and in uniting with the body it
[47:13] has become one with the body so the body
[47:16] is the head the headships in the body
[47:18] the body is expressing the hedge shim
[47:21] so the capstones in the bride the bride
[47:23] has become the manifestation of the
[47:24] capstone the headship is in the body
[47:28] so i'm not looking around where is the
[47:30] headship where the capstones come down
[47:33] to unite with the body i've got to go
[47:34] find the capstone the capstone is in the
[47:37] body
[47:42] amen in christ is the mystery of god
[47:44] revealed it says now we see the promise
[47:47] being fulfilled
[47:48] christ the true headship
[47:50] going in coming in his bride
[47:55] i love how he changes that
[47:57] he says christ the true hedge of going
[47:59] in he corrects it coming in his bride
[48:02] where's the headship it's coming in
[48:03] bright
[48:04] form doing the same works that he did at
[48:07] the beginning and making ready and
[48:08] fulfilling the word as he did it first
[48:10] in john 14 12.
[48:12] he that believeth on me the works that i
[48:14] do shall he do also then the head and
[48:17] the body are becoming one in works and
[48:19] in signs in life vindicated by god
[48:22] himself
[48:23] through his promised word for the last
[48:25] day he promised this in the last day now
[48:28] if you're spiritual you'll catch it
[48:31] now i want to get to a thought that i've
[48:33] been meditating on for a while in the
[48:36] it's in the message souls that are in
[48:38] prison now
[48:40] the prophet of god he has an experience
[48:42] many of us know we've listened to the
[48:44] message we've spoken about this before
[48:46] but
[48:47] he has an experience when he's a boy
[48:50] and he gets shot and he goes into an
[48:51] operation and
[48:53] and
[48:54] while he's on the operating table or
[48:55] sometime around that event he goes into
[48:58] hell he falls he feels himself
[48:59] descending down into hell and when he's
[49:02] in hell you know he tells us that he
[49:03] called out for daddy there was no daddy
[49:05] there called out for mama there was no
[49:07] mama there he called up for god there
[49:08] was no god there and he tells us he was
[49:10] descending into the realms of the lost
[49:12] and and when he got deep down he started
[49:16] seeing women and he started seeing they
[49:18] looked funny they had uh colored around
[49:20] their eyes and he said they were pointed
[49:22] back and he started describing what what
[49:25] hell was like and what they were there
[49:27] and the sounds and and the feeling and
[49:30] and
[49:31] he goes to tucson arizona in 1963 on a
[49:35] shopping trip with his wife
[49:38] and when he's on the shopping trip
[49:40] he has that
[49:42] experience where there's people all
[49:44] around talking in jc penney's he said
[49:46] you know talking about the price of this
[49:47] and talking and then up from the
[49:49] escalator comes
[49:50] two women speaking in spanish and
[49:52] they've got the same paint on their eyes
[49:54] the same hair done the same way and the
[49:56] eyes painted back he said like cat eyes
[49:59] and he says all of a sudden there i was
[50:01] in hell again
[50:03] he says in paragraph 97
[50:05] i thought then as i noticed them
[50:07] cankered looking eyes on them women
[50:09] they were the spanish the french the
[50:11] indian the white and all together but
[50:13] the great big heads you know bushed up
[50:15] with them combs the way they comb it
[50:17] back way big and then comes out you know
[50:19] and you know how they do fix it in like
[50:21] they do
[50:23] and then them cankered looking eyes in
[50:25] the eyes with the paint
[50:27] they run back like a cat's eyes
[50:29] and them talking and there was there i
[50:31] was again standing there in jc penney's
[50:34] store back in hell again
[50:38] this experience it it affected him so
[50:40] much that he was troubled and he even
[50:42] leaned on his wife's arm to walk out of
[50:44] the store he had to go home and he was
[50:46] so troubled by what he saw because of
[50:48] the feeling of being back in hell again
[50:51] and and brother branham says there i was
[50:53] again
[50:54] standing there in jcpenney store
[50:57] back in hell again
[50:59] this is this is what
[51:02] prompted brother branham to preach souls
[51:04] that are in prison now
[51:06] because he saw
[51:07] hell had now erupted on earth earth was
[51:10] now
[51:11] influenced so much by hell it was
[51:13] manifesting hell
[51:16] listen that was 1963.
[51:20] here we are in
[51:22] 2022 if hell was being manifested on
[51:26] earth then hell is being manifested on
[51:28] earth today
[51:32] and brother branham was
[51:34] and
[51:35] he was back in hell again
[51:37] he literally went through the same
[51:39] experience he did as a boy now what he
[51:42] experienced deep in the abyss now was in
[51:46] jcpenney store
[51:49] think about that friends hell upon earth
[51:52] hell opened up and spilled out upon
[51:55] earth
[51:57] but greater is he that's in you than he
[51:59] that's in the world
[52:01] if hell had spilled out upon the earth
[52:03] then something else must be spilled out
[52:06] upon the earth too
[52:07] if hell was manifesting himself on earth
[52:10] amen there's never anything coming from
[52:13] the kingdom of the devil that'll ever
[52:15] conquer he that is in you amen so as
[52:18] long as he is in you there's nothing
[52:20] that's greater than this so if hell if
[52:23] what was deep down in hell was now upon
[52:26] earth amen what was high in the heavens
[52:29] was now upon earth too
[52:32] what was deep buried in the abyss was
[52:35] spilled out on earth what was in the
[52:37] back cart of god's mind was now spilled
[52:39] out upon earth there was two forces and
[52:42] he that is in you is greater than he
[52:44] that's in the world
[52:47] that will never overcome
[52:49] you
[52:52] so brother bannon is preaching he comes
[52:54] back to preach souls that are in prison
[52:56] now and he was troubled by seeing hell
[52:58] spilled out upon the earth the gates of
[53:00] hell open amen in hell on earth earth
[53:04] and a hellish condition
[53:06] and he begins to to preach about could
[53:09] it be over and it's just a question in
[53:11] his mind he said one day it will be has
[53:13] the last one been called are these souls
[53:15] that are in prison now that we're
[53:16] preaching to amen any and he begins to
[53:19] ask the question he's not i'm not saying
[53:20] that it is but one day it will be it
[53:22] looks very much like it is and the
[53:24] reason he's asking the question is
[53:26] because he knows the lamb's taking the
[53:27] book
[53:29] there's no reason to ask the question if
[53:30] the lamb hadn't taken the book and
[53:31] loosed the seals
[53:33] so now he's asking questions he knows
[53:34] the lamb took the book and loosed the
[53:36] seals now he's asking the question is it
[53:38] all over is there no more mercy
[53:42] that was in the morning service he's
[53:43] preaching soldier in prison
[53:45] on
[53:46] the 10th of november
[53:48] in 1963
[53:51] and it's amazing he comes back for the
[53:53] evening service
[53:54] and when he comes back in the evening
[53:56] service guess what he preaches
[53:59] he that is in you
[54:01] in the morning service he preaches hell
[54:04] is on earth amen is there no more mercy
[54:06] then he comes back and preaches he
[54:08] that's in you amen the answer to the
[54:10] question is he that's in you the answer
[54:12] to the dilemma is he that's in you the
[54:15] answer come in the evening it's he
[54:17] that's in you is greater than he that's
[54:19] in the world
[54:22] so he tells two stories one story he
[54:25] tells in the morning that's his
[54:26] experience in jcpenney's
[54:29] then he comes in the evening he this
[54:30] june and he tells another story
[54:32] and i went back and i listened to what
[54:34] brother branham said and and when he was
[54:36] in the message soul's in prison now now
[54:38] that's in november november 10th
[54:41] and when he's in the message he says
[54:43] four weeks ago i was in jcpenney so a
[54:46] month previous
[54:48] so somewhere a month somewhere around a
[54:51] month previous he has this experience in
[54:52] jcpenney's
[54:54] but then when he comes to the message in
[54:56] the evening he that's in you he's going
[54:58] to start talking about his experience
[55:00] during a storm in colorado
[55:03] and that storm we know took place on
[55:06] october 24th because it was the day
[55:07] after his anniversary
[55:10] because on his anniversary he went down
[55:12] to the city they were going to get more
[55:13] rations because the storm was coming and
[55:14] he called his wife to to wish her a
[55:17] happy anniversary but she wasn't there
[55:19] so he called another sister and he asked
[55:21] that sister to wish her a happy
[55:22] anniversary
[55:25] how do you like that
[55:29] amen
[55:31] some things we just hear we don't preach
[55:34] we don't preach at this doctrine and we
[55:35] just hear it and say amen
[55:38] but that would have been october 24th
[55:40] which would have been 17 days prior to
[55:42] preaching this
[55:44] so these two experiences the prophet of
[55:46] god would have had roughly two weeks
[55:47] apart
[55:49] so he would have this experience in
[55:51] jcpenney's when he sees hell upon earth
[55:54] then approximately two weeks later he's
[55:56] going to be in colorado on a hunting
[55:59] trip when a storm is coming in and we
[56:01] know the story so well but but but he
[56:04] relates it again and he tells this is
[56:06] actually the first time that he tells
[56:08] this story in public
[56:10] and it just it happened roughly two
[56:12] weeks before uh this day and he's
[56:14] telling them that they were in the storm
[56:16] and how bad the blizzards were and how
[56:18] it's instant death they get caught out
[56:20] in one and he told everybody it was with
[56:21] him you make a beeline straight for the
[56:23] camp when the first snowflakes fall and
[56:26] and all of a sudden the storm rolls in
[56:28] and he finds himself in the storm and
[56:30] it's raining sleeting and snow's falling
[56:32] and he goes to get down off of the
[56:34] mountain like he told everybody else to
[56:36] do and a voice speaks to him says go
[56:38] back where you came from
[56:41] and the prophet of god doubts the voice
[56:45] i'm so glad he was honest
[56:48] how many times has god spoke to us and
[56:50] we questioned whether that was me or god
[56:52] that's what brother branham was doing he
[56:53] was questioning he said could that just
[56:55] be me so he sat down and he ate a
[56:57] sandwich
[56:58] and after he ate the sandwich said okay
[57:00] now i feel better i'm gonna go back to
[57:01] camp and the voice came again go back
[57:03] where you came from and he said go back
[57:05] into that storm
[57:08] it's death
[57:10] but he said i've learned by now to
[57:11] always obey the lord
[57:14] so he went back into the storm and as he
[57:16] got back up there the lord spoke to him
[57:19] and told him to speak
[57:22] and whatever he said would come to pass
[57:24] and he spoke and he said storm i resent
[57:27] your coming
[57:29] and i command you to go back where you
[57:31] came from and sun to come out and shine
[57:33] for four days till our hunting trip is
[57:35] over
[57:37] and
[57:38] he says it this way and he that is in
[57:40] you paragraph 104 he said
[57:42] speak to those winds in that storm and
[57:44] it'll go away now this bible lays before
[57:47] me which my life is in that
[57:49] i raised up i said i do not doubt your
[57:51] voice lord i said cloud snow rain sleet
[57:53] i resist your coming in the name of the
[57:56] lord jesus christ go back to your places
[57:58] i say
[58:00] that the sun must come out and
[58:01] immediately shine for four days till our
[58:03] hunting trip is over and leave and i
[58:05] leave with my brethren
[58:07] it was just gushing just and
[58:09] she's making the sound so like that and
[58:11] it just started to go and it just
[58:13] started going whoosh and then it went
[58:17] and it stopped
[58:20] what was that
[58:22] at the same time hell was spilling upon
[58:24] earth
[58:26] there was a man born in sin
[58:29] that could speak the nature of the way
[58:30] adam did
[58:32] that could speak to the storm the same
[58:34] way jesus christ did when he was in
[58:36] flesh and he would put one foot on the
[58:38] bow of the boat and he would cry peace
[58:40] be still and the wind and the waves
[58:42] obeyed him now we have a son of god that
[58:45] has come to a fullness of redemption
[58:47] where he's come back to all that adam
[58:50] lost and he can stand there on the
[58:51] mountain that day when god gives him
[58:53] permission and he can speak to the storm
[58:56] he wasn't repeating what god told him to
[58:57] say he was saying what he wanted to say
[59:01] he had control over nature amen god told
[59:04] him to ask for what he wanted god told
[59:06] him to speak and he spoke and he gave
[59:08] details go back where you came from son
[59:10] come out shine for four days and nature
[59:13] obeyed the voice of a man
[59:16] not a virgin born man
[59:19] but a sin born man that had come into
[59:22] his redemption
[59:25] and at the same time hell is upon earth
[59:28] there is an adopted restored son of god
[59:30] upon earth again amen that has the
[59:32] restored power of the spoken word and
[59:35] control over nature amen it it shows
[59:38] that there's nothing that the devil can
[59:40] do that can outdo what god is doing
[59:43] there is no time that the devil is over
[59:46] overpowering god amen if this level goes
[59:49] to here rest assured this level is above
[59:52] that amen
[59:54] when you see things in the world go
[59:56] chaotic amen and you see the devil on
[59:58] the rampage and sin increasing by droves
[1:00:01] and chaos breaking out amen it doesn't
[1:00:03] matter what power is climbing here it
[1:00:06] never can outdo this power over here
[1:00:11] the same time hell spilled upon the
[1:00:12] earth there was a gateway where heaven
[1:00:16] could spill out upon the earth
[1:00:26] he says in god's provided place of
[1:00:28] worship
[1:00:30] but he promised
[1:00:32] just before
[1:00:34] just before the coming of the end time
[1:00:36] the world would get like it was in sodom
[1:00:38] when a man come down in human form three
[1:00:41] of them two angels and god himself that
[1:00:43] was god the bible said it was
[1:00:45] now he come down
[1:00:47] he manifest himself there by turning his
[1:00:49] back to the tent where sarah was and
[1:00:51] told abraham what sarah was thinking in
[1:00:53] the tents that right now jesus himself
[1:00:55] at the day when the son of man is being
[1:00:58] revealed in other words the son of man
[1:01:00] the ministry of jesus christ himself
[1:01:03] the church will come through
[1:01:04] justification through luther through
[1:01:06] sanctification through wesley through
[1:01:08] the baptism of the holy ghost or the
[1:01:10] pentecostals and go right on into the
[1:01:12] perfection of the son of man that when
[1:01:14] the when husband and wife will be the
[1:01:16] same
[1:01:17] self
[1:01:18] persons
[1:01:21] god will be so manifested into his bride
[1:01:24] his church till they will both be the
[1:01:27] same
[1:01:28] they are one now you see where we're at
[1:01:32] you realize the prophet of god had so
[1:01:35] many experiences and so many things that
[1:01:38] the lord did through him and he would
[1:01:40] come and share those on tapes so that we
[1:01:42] would have
[1:01:43] those those we call them stories those
[1:01:46] experiences with the lord
[1:01:49] but if you listen to the brother branham
[1:01:50] preaching the prophet of god never pends
[1:01:53] that to himself
[1:01:55] and he never limits it to him
[1:01:58] as the prophet of god is preaching
[1:02:00] especially as he's moving on in his
[1:02:03] ministry he is constantly trying to get
[1:02:06] the people to believe it for themselves
[1:02:10] he he he's constantly he'll get to the
[1:02:13] end of services and say things like now
[1:02:15] you all believe you have god in you you
[1:02:17] lay hands on one another
[1:02:19] he wasn't wanting to come to another
[1:02:21] prayer line he he come to the end of a
[1:02:23] service and he didn't want you know he
[1:02:25] would give a manifestation to build
[1:02:27] faith amen he would use his gift to
[1:02:29] build the people's faith he would have a
[1:02:31] prayer line he would have discernment
[1:02:32] amen and he said those things were to
[1:02:34] bring people's faith higher so that they
[1:02:37] could believe
[1:02:38] then after he would he would operate in
[1:02:40] this gift in the office that god put him
[1:02:42] in amen and and get the faith to a level
[1:02:45] he says now you're believers you believe
[1:02:47] that christ dwells in you that you have
[1:02:49] the holy ghost now you lay hands on one
[1:02:51] another he didn't want them amen he
[1:02:54] didn't want them dependent on coming to
[1:02:56] him
[1:02:58] he didn't want them dependent on coming
[1:03:01] to him to standing in his presence to
[1:03:02] having his hands laid on them he wanted
[1:03:04] to realize that what's on the platform
[1:03:06] is in you
[1:03:09] amen the his ministry would have failed
[1:03:13] if when he left the earth if everything
[1:03:15] would have went with him that would have
[1:03:16] been a failure of the ministry
[1:03:19] he was here to demonstrate that the
[1:03:21] headship is here he was here to
[1:03:23] demonstrate that christ is here he was
[1:03:25] here to show that christ is back in his
[1:03:27] church again the headship is here the
[1:03:30] son of man ministry jesus christ itself
[1:03:32] is present and he did that amen and god
[1:03:35] lifted that office and that word up and
[1:03:37] waved it for before the people so that
[1:03:39] you could see that christ is here
[1:03:44] but he told us that the wave sheath amen
[1:03:47] was the first part of the fruit of the
[1:03:50] harvest of the field to come to maturity
[1:03:54] testifying that the rest of the field
[1:03:57] will come to maturity
[1:04:02] you know there was
[1:04:04] testimonies
[1:04:06] of of different brethren you listen to
[1:04:08] testimonies on a testimony of brother
[1:04:09] billy paul
[1:04:11] and one of the testimonies that billy
[1:04:12] paul gave he makes a statement i don't
[1:04:14] remember exactly how he worded it but it
[1:04:16] just comes to my mind now the statement
[1:04:18] somehow where he says something like no
[1:04:20] matter what the situation was my dad was
[1:04:23] always in control
[1:04:26] and
[1:04:27] and you you see him looking at that and
[1:04:29] you see
[1:04:30] there's a man who
[1:04:32] amen
[1:04:33] he obviously had his own struggles he
[1:04:35] had his own things that he had to
[1:04:37] overcome in himself
[1:04:39] but the perspective from his son who
[1:04:40] traveled so much with him was he was
[1:04:42] always under control
[1:04:46] because i would put it this way he knew
[1:04:48] who he was
[1:04:51] he had a revelation of who he was and
[1:04:53] what he was on earth for and that god
[1:04:55] was with him
[1:04:57] and i don't want my children to have a
[1:04:59] testimony of me that dad was always out
[1:05:02] of control
[1:05:04] every time the buzzer went off he
[1:05:05] panicked
[1:05:07] i can tell you i'm not always done real
[1:05:09] well at that
[1:05:11] i've panicked
[1:05:12] i've been scared i've made uh
[1:05:15] quick decisions poor decisions out of
[1:05:17] fear out of anxiety i've spoke things
[1:05:20] that were not faith amen i've done all
[1:05:21] of those things but i don't want to live
[1:05:23] that way amen i want to live by
[1:05:25] revelation of the message of the hour
[1:05:27] not by the dictates of my emotion and
[1:05:30] fears and external circumstances i don't
[1:05:32] want every time the buzzer goes off to
[1:05:34] panic amen there's nothing in this world
[1:05:36] to panic about
[1:05:39] i could say that every day all day long
[1:05:41] i could put that in a recording and you
[1:05:43] put it on your phone and you could play
[1:05:44] it back to yourself 10 times a day and i
[1:05:46] could play it to myself we need to
[1:05:47] remember this at all times no man can
[1:05:50] pluck you out of my hand i'll be with
[1:05:52] you into the end of the world there is
[1:05:54] nothing to panic about amen we could
[1:05:56] take the voice of the prophet and and
[1:05:58] the quotes of the scriptures and put
[1:06:00] them on a reel and play them over and
[1:06:02] over and over again so that we realize
[1:06:04] nothing no diagnosis from a doctor no
[1:06:07] government situation no financial
[1:06:09] situation nothing nothing nothing is
[1:06:13] outside of god's knowledge of what he's
[1:06:15] doing in my life
[1:06:17] nothing is to destroy me everything is
[1:06:19] to prove me
[1:06:22] when we when we begin to to let
[1:06:25] revelation dictate our response
[1:06:28] and not our human emotion
[1:06:31] we begin to respond completely different
[1:06:33] to situations
[1:06:35] now all of a sudden when when trouble
[1:06:38] comes our way amen all of a sudden we
[1:06:40] begin to say
[1:06:41] wow i can't wait to see what god will do
[1:06:43] next
[1:06:45] all right this is only here to prove
[1:06:47] that i believe god and i believe you god
[1:06:50] i mean if we would if if we could just
[1:06:53] uh reprogram ourselves
[1:06:56] that's what the word is doing it's
[1:06:57] reprogramming us
[1:07:00] if we could just get to where our
[1:07:01] initial response in the face of trouble
[1:07:04] is this is here to prove that i believe
[1:07:07] god
[1:07:08] then i guarantee our next response would
[1:07:10] be much different
[1:07:13] this is only here to prove that i
[1:07:14] believe god and the next thing we would
[1:07:16] do is be like all right i believe you
[1:07:18] god
[1:07:19] i'm not going to run scared i'm not
[1:07:21] going to panic i'm not i'm not going to
[1:07:23] throw away my confession i'm not going
[1:07:25] to do any of those things but i'm going
[1:07:27] to stand here with the same thing that i
[1:07:30] confessed on sunday and the same thing i
[1:07:32] confessed last time you delivered me i'm
[1:07:34] going to confess it again today
[1:07:39] he says
[1:07:41] in the in the message adoption from 1960
[1:07:45] said bible teaching is usually a little
[1:07:47] treacherous
[1:07:48] a little you know kind of walking out on
[1:07:50] thin ice that makes me nervous
[1:07:53] i'm not a thin ice kind of guy kind of
[1:07:56] walking out on thin ice we call it but
[1:07:58] we just feel that maybe at this point at
[1:08:00] this time it might be good to kind of
[1:08:02] bring the church to what i think to a
[1:08:05] complete understanding positionally of
[1:08:07] what we are in christ jesus
[1:08:10] so brother bam's coming to the adoption
[1:08:12] in adoption he's he's really laying out
[1:08:16] the church ages as the body has been
[1:08:19] built over seven church ages coming to
[1:08:21] the capping off which will be the
[1:08:23] adoption of the church which is when
[1:08:25] christ the headstone will come to the
[1:08:27] church and be unified with it and bring
[1:08:29] it into adoption
[1:08:30] positional placing and brother bam's
[1:08:33] teaching this to want so the church
[1:08:35] would know its position in christ
[1:08:38] but teaching pla i'm sorry
[1:08:40] he said a complete understanding
[1:08:42] positionally of what we are in christ
[1:08:44] jesus and sometimes i think that
[1:08:46] preaching is a wonderful thing but i
[1:08:47] believe sometimes brother bieler that
[1:08:49] teaching goes beyond that especially to
[1:08:52] the church now preaching usually catches
[1:08:54] the center
[1:08:56] brings him under condemnation
[1:08:58] by the word but teaching places a man
[1:09:01] positionally what he is
[1:09:04] and he can never rightly be able to have
[1:09:07] faith until positionally we know what we
[1:09:10] are
[1:09:12] well
[1:09:13] what can we have that's greater than
[1:09:16] faith
[1:09:18] nothing there's nothing that we can have
[1:09:21] that's greater than faith
[1:09:24] gifts will fail
[1:09:26] is that right
[1:09:28] tongues they shall cease uh
[1:09:30] gifts will fail
[1:09:33] all things will fail away but faith will
[1:09:35] never fail
[1:09:37] so
[1:09:38] teaching places a man positionally what
[1:09:40] he is
[1:09:42] so the teaching
[1:09:43] listen real bible teaching is not so
[1:09:46] that you understand like the order of
[1:09:49] scriptures and the correct teaching on a
[1:09:51] certain doctrine real bible teaching
[1:09:53] tells you what your position is
[1:09:56] that's real bible teaching bible real
[1:09:59] bible teaching what paul was doing to
[1:10:01] the church amen he was positioning the
[1:10:03] church amen he was telling them what
[1:10:05] their position in christ is
[1:10:07] paul wasn't saying now you remember uh
[1:10:10] way back when moses said that uh the the
[1:10:13] uh you know the scholars are saying this
[1:10:15] but they got the wrong translation of
[1:10:17] the wrong hebrew word the real
[1:10:19] translation of that hebrew word is xyz
[1:10:22] and that's what it means
[1:10:23] that's not bible teaching
[1:10:26] that's intellectual exercises
[1:10:29] but real bible teaching is not you know
[1:10:32] learning the chronology of the bible
[1:10:34] amen and learning all the proper greek
[1:10:36] and understand no real bible teaching
[1:10:39] will take the believer and position them
[1:10:41] in christ and establish them in the word
[1:10:43] so that they know who they are what they
[1:10:45] are
[1:10:47] that's real teaching
[1:10:49] but teaching places a man positionally
[1:10:51] what he is and he can never rightly be
[1:10:53] able to have faith until positionally we
[1:10:55] know what we are so we can never rightly
[1:10:58] have faith until we get the good bible
[1:11:01] teaching that brings us into our
[1:11:03] position amen that's what the opening of
[1:11:05] the seals that's what the preaching and
[1:11:06] to the bride after the seals that's what
[1:11:09] it was all about if you look at the
[1:11:10] ministry of brother branham amen he
[1:11:13] positioned amen the church ages he
[1:11:15] positioned amen the messengers he
[1:11:18] positioned the whole history from the
[1:11:20] time of christ all the way to his day he
[1:11:22] got everything in position
[1:11:24] is that right
[1:11:26] so that he could position the bride
[1:11:28] he had to lay it all out this was this
[1:11:31] and this was this and this was it so
[1:11:32] there's no confusion where we're at amen
[1:11:35] as everything was positioned the new
[1:11:36] testament was positioned the doctrines
[1:11:38] were positioned amen the church ages
[1:11:40] were positioned everything was
[1:11:42] positioned so that he could come at the
[1:11:44] time of the opening of the seals and say
[1:11:46] in the first seal i'm now going to call
[1:11:48] you bride what was he doing he was
[1:11:50] positioning the church
[1:11:52] this isn't church age anymore and this
[1:11:55] isn't church anymore because church was
[1:11:57] a mixed multitude amen church was two
[1:11:59] vines amen that's what he showed through
[1:12:01] the church ages so i'm not any longer
[1:12:03] calling you church because this isn't
[1:12:05] for two vines
[1:12:09] but i'm going to call you bride
[1:12:12] so that you'll
[1:12:13] understand
[1:12:15] i have to position you so you'll
[1:12:18] understand what i'm teaching you
[1:12:21] because if he hadn't called them bride
[1:12:23] and he called them church amen the
[1:12:25] things that he was teaching would have
[1:12:27] been put to the future but he had to
[1:12:30] position them so that they could
[1:12:31] understand what he's teaching them
[1:12:34] and if you look at the ministry from
[1:12:36] that point on he was preaching to the
[1:12:39] bride amen he was establishing the bride
[1:12:42] he was preaching present truth he was
[1:12:45] showing the bride coming of christ he
[1:12:47] was showing the wheat had come back into
[1:12:49] the life again they were showing he was
[1:12:51] showing amen the position of the bride
[1:12:54] from then on
[1:12:56] that was good bible teaching
[1:13:01] so i want to say this again
[1:13:04] you could never rightly be able to have
[1:13:06] faith
[1:13:08] until positionally we know what we are
[1:13:12] that's why you can know what brother
[1:13:13] branham is it won't give you the right
[1:13:15] faith
[1:13:17] you can know that there'll be an end
[1:13:18] time bribe but that doesn't give and
[1:13:20] tell you
[1:13:21] until the word places you positionally
[1:13:24] and what you are in christ then you have
[1:13:27] the faith
[1:13:31] now brother branham says in the message
[1:13:32] perfect faith
[1:13:34] said jesus had perfect faith
[1:13:37] he had it and he came because he was the
[1:13:39] word
[1:13:41] and i want you to catch this statement
[1:13:42] really close
[1:13:44] and you become the word he repeats it
[1:13:47] you become the word
[1:13:49] as you receive the word
[1:13:54] you become the word as you receive the
[1:13:57] word
[1:13:59] this is why we cannot say
[1:14:02] you know 20 years ago i come to the
[1:14:04] message i believe that god sent a
[1:14:05] prophet and i'm fine for life that's all
[1:14:07] i needed
[1:14:09] no the word that he's opening is still
[1:14:11] positioning us
[1:14:13] it's still giving us faith amen faith is
[1:14:16] coming by by the revealing of the word
[1:14:18] what is the revelation of the word doing
[1:14:20] it's positioning the bride amen in
[1:14:23] christ and that is bringing a greater
[1:14:25] faith in a greater faith in a greater
[1:14:27] faith amen and that's why we have to
[1:14:29] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:14:33] it takes the revelation of the word and
[1:14:36] so you become the word as you receive
[1:14:40] the word and god is constantly unveiling
[1:14:43] himself he is the word and as we receive
[1:14:46] that we're becoming the word our faith
[1:14:48] is increasing we're becoming more like
[1:14:50] christ not less like christ
[1:14:53] so that's why it's important to
[1:14:55] constantly feed on the word
[1:14:58] constantly be in this message talk about
[1:15:00] these things amen
[1:15:02] listen to the preaching of the word
[1:15:04] listen to the tapes read the books
[1:15:06] constantly constantly constantly because
[1:15:09] you become the word as you receive the
[1:15:11] word
[1:15:13] but if you don't know what the word is
[1:15:15] if you don't know what the message is
[1:15:17] saying how do you become the word
[1:15:20] what are you receiving if you're not
[1:15:22] receiving the revelation of the word
[1:15:26] i mean we can say all kinds of things
[1:15:27] i'm receiving the word but what word are
[1:15:30] you receiving amen are you receiving the
[1:15:32] word that's establishing the bride in
[1:15:34] this day bringing faith are we are we
[1:15:37] just saying i'm receiving the word god
[1:15:39] sent a prophet and there'll be a bride
[1:15:41] but what about you amen where are you at
[1:15:43] today what's going on now amen what is
[1:15:45] god revealed about you what's your
[1:15:46] position
[1:15:50] sometimes i wonder
[1:15:52] if our lack of faith sometimes is our
[1:15:55] lack of being positioned in the word
[1:15:59] so we're always looking for something to
[1:16:01] bolster our faith
[1:16:04] now i'm gonna
[1:16:06] i'm gonna say this because
[1:16:08] brother branham taught it you know
[1:16:11] he said the real gentile way is to
[1:16:14] believe the word and accept it
[1:16:17] but so many times we're looking for
[1:16:19] something to bolster our faith and
[1:16:20] that's not always wrong there's
[1:16:21] scriptures for these things
[1:16:23] but we always want you know
[1:16:26] a gift a display something
[1:16:29] but god wants his bride to come to a
[1:16:31] reliance upon his word
[1:16:34] to where she says lord you promised this
[1:16:38] i'm taking you at your word and i'm
[1:16:40] going to believe it the way the
[1:16:42] centurion man did lord i'm not even
[1:16:44] worthy that you come in my house just
[1:16:45] speak the words
[1:16:48] and just look and say lord you've
[1:16:50] already spoken in your word i take you
[1:16:52] at your word i believe it
[1:16:56] see
[1:16:57] if we come into a proper
[1:16:59] uh position and understanding we have
[1:17:02] faith faith to what faith to take the
[1:17:04] word faith to believe
[1:17:06] all the word for our day
[1:17:09] and the message recognizing
[1:17:11] your day and its message
[1:17:14] so now i'm going to say something
[1:17:16] national force put israel in her
[1:17:18] homeland
[1:17:19] national force will put the church in
[1:17:20] the world council of churches but the
[1:17:22] power of god will put the people in the
[1:17:24] bride
[1:17:26] is that right
[1:17:29] the world forces this way and the world
[1:17:31] forces that way but god forces upward
[1:17:36] so i want to see how the power of god
[1:17:39] will put
[1:17:41] the power of god will put the people in
[1:17:43] the bride
[1:17:44] how
[1:17:46] i'll wait till a wind rushes through the
[1:17:49] church
[1:17:52] but he said the power of god
[1:17:54] how will the power of god be made
[1:17:56] manifest how will the power of god be
[1:17:58] felt how will the power of god be
[1:17:59] realized because the power of god it is
[1:18:01] the power of god that will put the
[1:18:03] people in the bride
[1:18:05] the world forces this way the world
[1:18:07] forces that way but god forces upward
[1:18:11] spirit of god
[1:18:13] which is the word of god
[1:18:15] you caught that
[1:18:18] oh we want the spirit of god to move
[1:18:21] then you need the word of god moving
[1:18:23] is that right
[1:18:24] if you want the spirit of god to move in
[1:18:26] our midst the word of god has to be
[1:18:28] moving in our midst because the word and
[1:18:29] the spirit are the same thing
[1:18:32] the spirit of god which is the word of
[1:18:33] god my word of spirit and life will put
[1:18:36] the bride in her place
[1:18:39] what will put the people in the bride
[1:18:41] what will put the bride in her place
[1:18:42] what is this great power it's the
[1:18:44] revelation of the word that's been
[1:18:46] revealed in this day will put the people
[1:18:47] in the bride
[1:18:50] remember the bride's revival
[1:18:53] was the restoration of the word the
[1:18:55] bride's revival wasn't uh it wasn't a
[1:18:58] dynamic outpouring that had uh all kinds
[1:19:01] of manifestations the bride's revival
[1:19:03] was the restoration of the word the word
[1:19:05] coming back to the church is the bride's
[1:19:07] revival
[1:19:09] and that word will put the people back
[1:19:11] in the bride
[1:19:13] all right
[1:19:15] the word is spirit and life will put the
[1:19:16] bride in her place because she'll
[1:19:18] recognize her position in the word then
[1:19:21] she's in christ will put her in her
[1:19:23] place well to put her in her place her
[1:19:25] revelation of this word will put her in
[1:19:27] her place
[1:19:29] no national force will do it but the
[1:19:31] national force did drive israel to the
[1:19:33] homeland the national forces of the
[1:19:35] council of churches will drive every
[1:19:36] organization into it but the power of
[1:19:39] god will raise the bride and to glory
[1:19:41] out of it
[1:19:42] o people recognize your day as jesus
[1:19:45] warned you the sign of sodom and the
[1:19:47] church conditions of this day
[1:19:50] he goes on and christ is the mystery of
[1:19:52] god reveal and say what is it not them
[1:19:54] people the headship in the body has
[1:19:57] become one
[1:19:59] has become one unit
[1:20:00] it's god manifested in his people that's
[1:20:03] the reason the husband and wife is no
[1:20:05] longer twain
[1:20:06] they are one god in this church is one
[1:20:09] christ in you god's great revelation
[1:20:13] what's god's great revelation the
[1:20:14] mystery god revealed
[1:20:16] christ in you the hope of glory christ
[1:20:20] in you god's great revelation
[1:20:23] glory to god even bearing his name his
[1:20:25] name is jesus the anointed the reason he
[1:20:27] is called jesus he is the anointed it's
[1:20:29] the anointed body of christ proving
[1:20:32] manifesting god like that body did and
[1:20:34] that body redeemed every of these bodies
[1:20:38] and through there god works his
[1:20:39] threefold manifestation
[1:20:41] going to the kingdom
[1:20:44] now
[1:20:45] brother branham is going to make a
[1:20:47] statement here in christ is the mystery
[1:20:48] of god revealed and it's a statement
[1:20:50] that has stumbled many many people amen
[1:20:53] but it's i just want to go on record on
[1:20:55] saying it's nothing but the truth
[1:20:57] he said the church is the blood of
[1:21:00] christ by the spirit
[1:21:03] i mean that stumbles a lot of people
[1:21:05] amen because we have denominational
[1:21:08] ideas of things amen we have physical
[1:21:10] ideas of physical blood on a physical
[1:21:12] cross and that was there that was the
[1:21:15] price that was paid for our redemption
[1:21:16] but the prophet of god said the church
[1:21:18] is the blood of christ by the spirit
[1:21:20] because the life is in the blood
[1:21:23] what was released when the blood cell
[1:21:25] was broken the life was released where
[1:21:26] did the life go the life now could come
[1:21:28] back into the people amen so the the
[1:21:31] spirit is the life amen the life was in
[1:21:34] the blood and now the church becomes the
[1:21:37] blood by the spirit because the life is
[1:21:39] in the blood showing one that the life
[1:21:42] of the blood is in the bride
[1:21:52] he said the church is the blood of
[1:21:53] christ by the spirit because the life is
[1:21:55] in the blood
[1:21:57] where else is the life
[1:22:00] the head
[1:22:02] ship the head is in the body
[1:22:05] where is the life
[1:22:07] where is the spirit
[1:22:09] where did that mighty angel go when he
[1:22:11] came down the headship the word christ
[1:22:14] himself the the son of man it's in the
[1:22:17] body in the bride
[1:22:20] that life
[1:22:22] is in the bride is in the church that's
[1:22:25] the baptism of the holy ghost that
[1:22:26] baptizes us unto his body that
[1:22:29] recognizes only his body his flesh
[1:22:32] his word
[1:22:35] you see
[1:22:38] brother branham is preaching christ is
[1:22:40] the mystery of god or no he's preaching
[1:22:41] souls that are in prison now asking
[1:22:43] could it be all over
[1:22:44] it will be one day when that last one
[1:22:47] comes in it'll be all over
[1:22:49] and then that evening he comes and he
[1:22:51] preaches he that is in you
[1:22:56] he that is in you
[1:22:58] man who's in you
[1:23:00] the life
[1:23:02] the life of the blood
[1:23:05] is in you
[1:23:06] amen as
[1:23:07] as long as the bride is here until that
[1:23:10] last predestinated seed is is called and
[1:23:13] sealed into the body as long as the
[1:23:14] bride is here there's life available
[1:23:17] friends
[1:23:18] there's blood here there's something
[1:23:19] here because christ is here where is he
[1:23:22] at he's on his throne his throne is your
[1:23:24] heart he's here amen there's something
[1:23:27] for the people because the bride is here
[1:23:29] and we know that when the bride goes up
[1:23:31] amen the spirit of god leaves
[1:23:34] for the gentiles
[1:23:36] so so the answer to the question is he
[1:23:38] that is in you amen
[1:23:42] in the first seal he says
[1:23:44] for the mystery of iniquity does already
[1:23:46] work
[1:23:47] deceivers you see deceiving the people
[1:23:49] off into something he's reading a
[1:23:51] scripture and he says the mystery of
[1:23:52] iniquity does all the word already work
[1:23:54] and he injects the statement deceivers
[1:23:56] deceiving the people off into something
[1:23:58] now he's gonna he's gonna make he's
[1:24:00] going back to the scripture and he's
[1:24:02] going to inject comments so i'll try to
[1:24:03] keep it squared away
[1:24:05] now he goes back to the scripture only
[1:24:06] he he injects god so you know that he's
[1:24:09] talking about
[1:24:11] that letteth will let until he
[1:24:14] this is another he be taken out of the
[1:24:17] way
[1:24:18] so he that letteth which which means
[1:24:21] hinder or to hold back that's holding
[1:24:23] back this antichrist that's holding back
[1:24:25] amen all of all of the destruction
[1:24:27] that's coming upon the earth through the
[1:24:28] tribulation who's holding it back amen
[1:24:31] he
[1:24:32] will hold back we'll let he that now let
[1:24:35] us will let until he be taken out of the
[1:24:38] way
[1:24:39] so there's two he's
[1:24:41] he that now letteth will let until he be
[1:24:45] taken out of the way
[1:24:46] so he is somebody that's holding it back
[1:24:49] and he will hold it back until he's
[1:24:51] taken out of the way
[1:24:53] but listen to how brother benham
[1:24:54] describes these two he's
[1:24:58] he only he god
[1:25:00] that led us will let until he the church
[1:25:03] christ the bride
[1:25:06] be taken out of the way
[1:25:09] amen greater is he that is in you than
[1:25:11] he that's in the world amen he god
[1:25:14] that's holding it back will hold it back
[1:25:17] till he the church christ the bride be
[1:25:20] taken out of the way your presence is
[1:25:22] life amen your presence on this earth is
[1:25:25] holding a door open for the gentiles
[1:25:28] there is life the church is the blood by
[1:25:30] the spirit because the life is in the
[1:25:32] blood amen there's something here
[1:25:34] there's mercy here there's opportunity
[1:25:36] here
[1:25:40] greater is he that's in you
[1:25:43] than he that's in the world
[1:25:45] is hell here
[1:25:49] then heaven is here also
[1:25:52] and heaven is here in a greater force
[1:25:55] than hell
[1:25:58] how do you know heaven's here because
[1:26:00] the fullness of the word is here
[1:26:02] and brother bam told us hell is
[1:26:05] consisted of the word if the word has
[1:26:08] come
[1:26:09] heaven has come down
[1:26:12] where is heaven come down well i ask you
[1:26:15] where was hell at
[1:26:18] hell was manifest in people
[1:26:22] and j.c penney's all of a sudden the
[1:26:24] manifestation of hell required people to
[1:26:28] man it wasn't the clothes racks in jc
[1:26:31] penney's it wasn't the color of the wall
[1:26:33] it wasn't the lighting in jcpenney it
[1:26:35] was people who were anointed with demon
[1:26:38] spirits from hell they were manifesting
[1:26:41] the regions of the lost they were
[1:26:43] manifesting the regions of hell where
[1:26:45] was hell it was in the people
[1:26:48] so where will heaven be
[1:26:50] in the people amen there's two forces
[1:26:53] facing off but they're working in
[1:26:55] humanity in humankind in people and one
[1:26:58] is heaven which is in the bride and one
[1:27:00] is hell which is upon the people
[1:27:06] so greater is he that's in you
[1:27:08] than he that's in the world
[1:27:15] it was on the same
[1:27:17] and souls that are imprisoned now he
[1:27:19] comes down to the end of souls in prison
[1:27:21] now and he tells this story which i
[1:27:23] thought was really really interesting
[1:27:26] he said there was a man going along
[1:27:28] there one day
[1:27:29] just at the time for the tides to come
[1:27:31] in
[1:27:32] so the story was like in ireland or
[1:27:33] something he's walking along the coast
[1:27:35] and there's cliffs there and he was
[1:27:36] walking along at the time for the tides
[1:27:38] to come in
[1:27:39] and there was a noble man who lived on
[1:27:41] the hill that knowed these tides and he
[1:27:43] knowed the time of day that the tides
[1:27:44] were supposed to come
[1:27:46] he knowed what time the tide set in the
[1:27:48] guy didn't care what time he was one of
[1:27:51] those know-it-alls he's he had his own
[1:27:53] idea he was an athletic man smart
[1:27:55] intelligent fellow but he just didn't
[1:27:57] know the time of the time
[1:27:59] he didn't know the country he didn't
[1:28:00] know the time the signs was right then
[1:28:02] the moon had dropped its back from the
[1:28:04] earth
[1:28:05] now listen to what he says
[1:28:08] and when god ever drops his spirit from
[1:28:10] the earth brother she's gone it's all
[1:28:12] over
[1:28:13] that moon would ever move out of its
[1:28:15] place
[1:28:18] if that moon would ever move out of this
[1:28:20] place the waters would cover the earth
[1:28:22] like it was when the god started it in
[1:28:24] genesis 1. but the moon set there and
[1:28:27] when it just even turns its head the
[1:28:28] tides start running in
[1:28:31] brother man's talking about the tides
[1:28:32] that are going to come in and destroy
[1:28:33] this man because there was somebody
[1:28:35] there that knew the the position of the
[1:28:37] moon
[1:28:39] the tides were coming in and he said
[1:28:40] this moon ever moves out of its position
[1:28:43] what's the moon a type of
[1:28:45] the bride
[1:28:47] amen
[1:28:48] you don't know
[1:28:50] what your presence is on this earth
[1:28:54] we think things are happening to us and
[1:28:56] happening all around us and
[1:28:58] and sometimes we can feel like my life
[1:29:00] is out of control you have no idea what
[1:29:02] your presence is doing for this world
[1:29:05] because when the moon moves out of
[1:29:07] position and drops over to the drops out
[1:29:10] of the way then the floods will cover
[1:29:12] the earth
[1:29:13] i'm not talking physical i'm talking
[1:29:15] spiritual
[1:29:18] brother brahma said in the in the
[1:29:20] laodicean church age
[1:29:22] out of the church age book
[1:29:25] he said a momentary consideration of
[1:29:27] church history will prove how accurate
[1:29:28] this thought is
[1:29:30] in the dark ages the word was almost
[1:29:32] entirely lost to the people
[1:29:34] but god sent luther with the word
[1:29:36] the lutheran spoke for god at that time
[1:29:39] but they organized and again the pure
[1:29:41] word was lost for organization tends
[1:29:43] towards dogma and creeds and not simple
[1:29:45] word
[1:29:46] they could no longer speak for god
[1:29:49] then god sent wesley and he was the
[1:29:50] voice with the word in his day
[1:29:53] the people who took his revelation from
[1:29:55] god became the living epistles read and
[1:29:57] known of all men for their generation
[1:30:00] when the methodist failed god raised up
[1:30:02] others and so it has gone on through the
[1:30:03] years until in the last day there was
[1:30:05] again another people in the land who
[1:30:08] under their messenger will be the final
[1:30:10] voice to the final age
[1:30:12] yes sir the church is no longer the
[1:30:14] mouthpiece of god
[1:30:15] it is its own mouthpiece
[1:30:18] so god
[1:30:19] is turning on her he will confound her
[1:30:21] through the prophet and the bride for
[1:30:23] the voice of god will be in her
[1:30:26] yes it is for it says in the last
[1:30:28] chapter of revelation verse 17
[1:30:31] the spirit
[1:30:32] and the bride say come
[1:30:37] that is our call
[1:30:39] come
[1:30:41] the spirit and the bride say come where
[1:30:43] is the spirit in the bride
[1:30:46] what is that the life how did it come
[1:30:49] the restoration of the word
[1:30:51] the headship christ himself is connected
[1:30:54] with his body in his body his bride
[1:30:56] where is the life of christ in the body
[1:30:59] we're trying to get people to christ but
[1:31:01] christ is here
[1:31:03] he's the revelation of the word in this
[1:31:05] hour connected with a body of believers
[1:31:08] upon this earth we don't realize
[1:31:10] sometimes what we are
[1:31:14] the the the prophet came and he showed
[1:31:17] it every which way he could show it
[1:31:19] trying to get us to realize what we are
[1:31:21] to accept it to receive it because you
[1:31:23] become the word as you receive the word
[1:31:29] we're here
[1:31:31] holding back hell
[1:31:35] opportunities of salvation are here
[1:31:38] because the life of the word is here
[1:31:42] the
[1:31:42] hell would love to take over
[1:31:45] but it cannot because you're here
[1:31:50] you think of that on a grand scale
[1:31:53] what what what life is connected to
[1:31:56] human vessels on this earth and what
[1:31:58] effect it's having upon the whole earth
[1:32:00] we know that the world is responding to
[1:32:02] the maturity of the bride because the
[1:32:04] earth is groaning in travail for the
[1:32:06] manifestations of the son of god well
[1:32:08] listen brother benham taught us in birth
[1:32:10] pains that as it gets closer to delivery
[1:32:13] the contractions get tighter and more
[1:32:15] intense and i would like to say the
[1:32:17] contractions are tighter and more
[1:32:18] intense
[1:32:20] earthquakes and pestilence and wars and
[1:32:23] all kinds of rumors and disasters of all
[1:32:26] kind the the the the birth pains are
[1:32:29] getting more intense and closer together
[1:32:31] in frequency
[1:32:33] what's that mean the earth is getting
[1:32:35] ready to burst forth on bright new earth
[1:32:37] for a millennium
[1:32:41] well if that's the case
[1:32:42] where is your maturity what level is the
[1:32:45] bride coming to where what is she
[1:32:47] beginning to manifest she must be coming
[1:32:49] into a fuller manifestation a greater
[1:32:52] revelation because the earth is
[1:32:53] responding to her maturity because the
[1:32:56] earth can't get to a millennium until
[1:32:57] the bride amen gets lifted off before
[1:33:00] the cleansing
[1:33:05] so the word
[1:33:06] the revelation of the word the teaching
[1:33:08] the prophet gave us
[1:33:10] is putting us in position
[1:33:13] and that position
[1:33:15] is a position that's stemming back
[1:33:18] the lie of the devil
[1:33:20] that's holding back the full force of
[1:33:23] hell
[1:33:24] heaven is here amen mercy is still here
[1:33:27] there's an opportunity for salvation as
[1:33:29] far as we know it's still here why
[1:33:31] because the blood the churches the blood
[1:33:33] by the spirit
[1:33:36] you're carrying the word carrying the
[1:33:38] spirit carrying the line and offering it
[1:33:40] to whosoever will amen there's so many
[1:33:43] things in this world we feel like we
[1:33:45] can't do anything about them there's
[1:33:47] troubles on every sign and people around
[1:33:49] us that are in trouble and we feel like
[1:33:50] what can i do to help who am i what what
[1:33:53] can i change and we don't realize
[1:33:55] because when we make statements like
[1:33:57] that what we're doing is taking
[1:33:59] ourselves out of the position god put us
[1:34:01] in and putting ourselves down in common
[1:34:03] humanity where we can't do anything
[1:34:07] well the truth is we in ourselves can't
[1:34:09] do anything but we are not just
[1:34:11] ourselves there's another life with us
[1:34:13] amen there's the life of christ dwelling
[1:34:16] in us amen and we can take our faith in
[1:34:18] who we are in our position and go to the
[1:34:20] lord and say lord amen i believe you've
[1:34:23] called me here for a reason amen and i
[1:34:25] see hell moving in on this individual
[1:34:27] and i want to push it back in the name
[1:34:29] of jesus christ i see this coming to my
[1:34:32] family i see this coming my way and god
[1:34:34] i want to take my position by the word
[1:34:37] and all the word that you've given to me
[1:34:39] i believe is for me and for this hour
[1:34:41] and i push back now in the name of jesus
[1:34:44] christ
[1:34:47] you don't know what you are
[1:34:50] sometimes we just don't know what we are
[1:34:54] if we just could keep in the forefront
[1:34:56] of our mind
[1:34:58] what we are who we are and who this is
[1:35:00] that's living in us
[1:35:02] we would stop throwing our hands up and
[1:35:04] saying i don't know
[1:35:06] well you know what you don't have to
[1:35:07] know
[1:35:08] the one in you knows
[1:35:12] i don't have a figure you don't have to
[1:35:13] have it figured out the one inside of
[1:35:15] you has it figured out so don't go
[1:35:17] losing your mind stay connected to
[1:35:19] christ he's in you he's in control
[1:35:21] nothing's out of kilter the cog is
[1:35:23] turning just right on time everything's
[1:35:25] working perfect according to god's plan
[1:35:29] don't lose faith
[1:35:31] hold fast
[1:35:33] when you've got loved ones that you love
[1:35:36] listen
[1:35:37] where's the life at
[1:35:39] it's in you
[1:35:41] say god
[1:35:43] i believe the life is in me and i want
[1:35:45] them lord i want them to be saved i want
[1:35:47] them to see this message pray pray with
[1:35:50] faith amen
[1:35:52] pray and believe pray with your position
[1:35:55] pray as the bride of jesus christ pray
[1:35:58] amen pray as the temple that's templing
[1:36:00] christ pray as the habitation of god
[1:36:03] pray as one who's connected with god and
[1:36:05] has god living on the inside
[1:36:08] not to a god a million miles away that
[1:36:10] hopefully will hear me and hopefully be
[1:36:12] kind and hopefully answer don't pray
[1:36:15] like that friends
[1:36:17] those prayers they leave us more
[1:36:19] devastated usually at the end
[1:36:23] but let's pray to the one that's inside
[1:36:26] and let's pray according to the position
[1:36:28] he put us in say lord you called me i
[1:36:30] didn't call myself
[1:36:32] you've called me to be your bride
[1:36:34] you've called me lord you you're living
[1:36:36] inside of me and i believe that all of
[1:36:39] this word is for me
[1:36:41] and i'm not going to back down and i'm
[1:36:43] not going to run afraid and i'm not
[1:36:44] going to let the devil scare me because
[1:36:46] greater is he that's in me than he
[1:36:48] that's in the world
[1:36:52] brother branham comes to the end of this
[1:36:53] message
[1:36:54] that he preaches that evening
[1:36:56] in november he that is in you
[1:36:59] and it's astounding
[1:37:01] as he begins to pray that he wanted to
[1:37:03] have prayer for the sick so he starts
[1:37:05] discerning he didn't pass out prayer
[1:37:06] cards he starts discerning but he comes
[1:37:08] to this statement and it just thrilled
[1:37:10] my heart because of the way i was
[1:37:12] meditating
[1:37:14] he said now the lady i don't know but
[1:37:16] god knows the woman and he was talking
[1:37:18] to a woman that was in the back of the
[1:37:19] church
[1:37:21] he said now have you got something in
[1:37:23] your pocket
[1:37:24] a little handkerchief or something there
[1:37:26] all right
[1:37:27] when you sit down
[1:37:29] she was just standing up in the back he
[1:37:31] said you're there and she stood up in
[1:37:32] the back and he told her trouble and you
[1:37:34] can hear on the tape she says yes that's
[1:37:35] it that's right
[1:37:37] it was for her father
[1:37:39] and she didn't come to the front he
[1:37:41] didn't lay hands on her
[1:37:42] he says you back there he said when you
[1:37:44] sit down
[1:37:46] put your hands on that handkerchief and
[1:37:48] don't doubt and he that's in you is
[1:37:50] greater he that's killing your daddy
[1:37:53] what did brother branham want to
[1:37:54] demonstrate he that's in you he that's
[1:37:57] in you he that's in you brother man say
[1:38:00] not he that's in me amen god was in him
[1:38:02] of course we saw it we recognized it it
[1:38:04] was instrumental to recognize where god
[1:38:07] was working so that he could be the wave
[1:38:09] chief so that we would have confidence
[1:38:10] that it's the same god in us
[1:38:14] we don't have to have an office of
[1:38:15] profit we don't have to repeat
[1:38:16] everything he did but the same goddess
[1:38:18] there is the same god that's here
[1:38:20] friends
[1:38:22] and brother abraham didn't call a prayer
[1:38:24] line in the mind of he that is in you so
[1:38:26] that he could lay hands on everybody he
[1:38:28] he showed the sign of the messiah he
[1:38:30] showed the sermon but he told this woman
[1:38:32] amen don't come see me after church i'll
[1:38:34] give you a prayer cloth he said do
[1:38:36] you've got you had a pocketbook do you
[1:38:38] have a handkerchief or something in your
[1:38:39] pocketbook and she said yes he said when
[1:38:41] you sit down back there you lay your
[1:38:44] hand on it
[1:38:48] and don't doubt
[1:38:52] and he that's in you is greater that he
[1:38:54] that's killing your daddy
[1:38:56] believe with all your heart
[1:38:58] so shall it be as you
[1:39:01] believe
[1:39:05] when sickness strikes your house don't
[1:39:07] wait for sunday or wednesday
[1:39:11] he that's in you
[1:39:13] is greater than he that's in the world
[1:39:16] now don't also don't be afraid to come
[1:39:18] up for prayer because if during the
[1:39:19] preaching of the word god strikes your
[1:39:21] heart that word and says go up for
[1:39:22] prayer then you obey the spirit of god
[1:39:25] don't be afraid to come for prayer
[1:39:28] but this is not the only place where god
[1:39:30] answers prayer
[1:39:31] it's not the only way in which he heals
[1:39:33] his children greater is he that's in you
[1:39:35] than he that's in the world
[1:39:37] believe for god lay your hands on one
[1:39:40] another lay your hands on your children
[1:39:41] on your wife amen pray for one another
[1:39:43] believe the word you may not even be
[1:39:45] able to get to where you can lay hands
[1:39:47] on a brother or sister you may be away
[1:39:49] and your family remember calls and
[1:39:51] another family member is sick and you
[1:39:53] can say lord the same one who healed the
[1:39:55] servant of the centurion is the same one
[1:39:58] that can heal my child my family member
[1:40:01] my this or that if i have the same kind
[1:40:03] of faith and lord i believe amen that
[1:40:06] you have the authority
[1:40:08] to heal that and in the name of jesus
[1:40:10] christ i ask that you deliver this this
[1:40:12] this and that
[1:40:15] believe friends believe in who you are
[1:40:18] believe in who he's made you amen you
[1:40:20] haven't made yourself anything you never
[1:40:22] called yourself you didn't give yourself
[1:40:24] a revelation amen he did you didn't ask
[1:40:27] anybody to start preaching on the bride
[1:40:29] amen god called a man amen all the way
[1:40:32] back amen in the 30s and that man began
[1:40:35] preaching and he called him to be a
[1:40:37] prophet of the age and he gave him the
[1:40:39] revelation of the seven seals and began
[1:40:41] to teach about the bride you never asked
[1:40:44] anybody to preach on the bride
[1:40:48] you never asked brother ben would say
[1:40:50] call me bride
[1:40:53] i wasn't even alive when he preached the
[1:40:54] first seal
[1:40:56] but on tape when i hear him say i'll
[1:40:58] call you bride he is calling me bride me
[1:41:01] personally to me i believe it that way
[1:41:05] i wasn't even lying i didn't ask him to
[1:41:07] say that but when he said it i believed
[1:41:08] it
[1:41:10] i didn't even ask to believe it i just
[1:41:13] believed it
[1:41:14] i didn't call myself i didn't reveal the
[1:41:17] message to myself i didn't god did that
[1:41:19] to me god did that to you why can't we
[1:41:21] believe in what he has called us to be
[1:41:25] what are we called to be
[1:41:27] him
[1:41:28] on this earth
[1:41:30] because as he is so are ye
[1:41:34] on the earth
[1:41:35] the headship
[1:41:37] is in the body
[1:41:38] the life is in the body
[1:41:41] he that is in you
[1:41:43] is greater than he that's in the world
[1:41:47] aren't you happy
[1:41:49] to be alive today
[1:41:51] let's all stand if musicians will come
[1:41:57] oh i think we could hear this preaching
[1:41:58] once a week
[1:42:01] i think it would help us
[1:42:03] we need to remember these things
[1:42:06] and you know
[1:42:09] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:42:10] that's in the world
[1:42:13] but so is greater that's in your brother
[1:42:16] and your sister that he's in the world
[1:42:20] you know how sometimes you just
[1:42:22] need a little something you're
[1:42:23] struggling and you just need a little
[1:42:25] help
[1:42:27] and you'll ask somebody will you lay
[1:42:29] hands on me and pray for me
[1:42:31] because i have confidence god is in you
[1:42:35] i don't think that disappoints god any
[1:42:38] i think that's the right kind of
[1:42:40] revelation
[1:42:41] that we know who our brothers and
[1:42:43] sisters are that we know
[1:42:44] where the dwelling place of almighty god
[1:42:47] is
[1:42:48] and when we recognize it i think it
[1:42:50] pleases our father
[1:42:52] amen
[1:42:54] greater is he this world
[1:42:57] according to prophecy
[1:42:59] will get more chaotic
[1:43:02] what we'll see and how much and in what
[1:43:04] way those things are up for debate we
[1:43:06] can sit around and we can talk about
[1:43:08] those for hours and we'll probably all
[1:43:09] be a little bit wrong
[1:43:12] or maybe a whole lot wrong
[1:43:15] but we know that birth pains will
[1:43:17] increase in intensity and get closer
[1:43:19] together
[1:43:20] we know that that more worlds will break
[1:43:23] out and pestilence and earthquakes and
[1:43:26] all these other natural disasters
[1:43:28] they're not going to stop friends
[1:43:30] we don't know how close it'll come to
[1:43:33] our home we don't know how much we'll
[1:43:34] actually see how much we'll experience
[1:43:37] it could be a little it could be a lot
[1:43:39] it could be somewhere in between
[1:43:41] but the same revelation
[1:43:44] holds throughout all
[1:43:45] he that is in you is greater than he
[1:43:47] that's in the world
[1:43:49] nothing will take you out of his hands
[1:43:51] and he will never leave you
[1:43:53] nor forsake you
[1:43:56] don't let these things
[1:43:58] rob us of our faith
[1:44:00] but in the midst of trials
[1:44:02] recognize
[1:44:04] god is allowing the devil to test my
[1:44:06] faith
[1:44:08] so i want the devil to hear loud and
[1:44:10] clear what i believe
[1:44:15] not
[1:44:15] not what's happening to me why i can't
[1:44:18] even believe i don't want the devil to
[1:44:20] hear that
[1:44:23] i want the devil to hear god
[1:44:25] this is a hard trial but i believe it's
[1:44:27] for your good
[1:44:28] and i believe that when i'm tried i
[1:44:31] shall come forth as gold
[1:44:34] oh praise god i still believe you god i
[1:44:36] still believe i'm in your hands i still
[1:44:38] believe the word is true that's what i
[1:44:40] want the devil to hear and i want to
[1:44:42] resist the devil and he'll flee i want
[1:44:44] to stop crying and stop complaining and
[1:44:46] stop panicking god help me to stop
[1:44:49] and let me be a manifested son of god
[1:44:52] amen that will not let my emotions run
[1:44:54] me but i will stop in the midst of a
[1:44:56] trial and say nothing's changed between
[1:44:58] me and god his word hasn't changed his
[1:45:01] idea hasn't shifted everything's fine
[1:45:04] god help us
[1:45:06] and i believe if we
[1:45:08] as a body of believers as the bride of
[1:45:10] jesus christ if we can take that
[1:45:13] attitude who knows what hardships are
[1:45:15] coming but people will recognize that
[1:45:17] there's something different in you than
[1:45:18] the rest of the world
[1:45:20] that's right
[1:45:23] greater is he that's in you
[1:45:25] than he that's in the world
[1:45:28] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:45:31] lord jesus we thank you
[1:45:34] we thank you lord for your wonderful
[1:45:36] word
[1:45:37] for the truth that you've given us in
[1:45:38] this hour
[1:45:40] oh god how you've manifested so
[1:45:42] powerfully lord so that we would have no
[1:45:45] room to doubt
[1:45:47] god forgive us for our fears lord and
[1:45:49] our anxieties and our nervousness
[1:45:52] god we want to lay that at your feet and
[1:45:54] repent of it lord
[1:45:55] it's just human emotion lord but we
[1:45:57] weren't given human emotion to rule us
[1:46:00] we were given the word to rule over us
[1:46:03] i wasn't told to yield to human emotion
[1:46:06] father but you told me to yield and
[1:46:08] surrender to your word
[1:46:10] god help me
[1:46:12] help me god grant me greater revelation
[1:46:15] that i might receive your word
[1:46:17] that i might have faith
[1:46:20] god that i might believe all that you've
[1:46:22] given for me to believe and that faith
[1:46:24] in me would conquer
[1:46:26] god i acknowledge your truth i believe
[1:46:29] it to be true what you said about me is
[1:46:31] true
[1:46:33] where you're dwelling is true
[1:46:36] god i just commit myself into your hands
[1:46:39] again and say
[1:46:40] you know best
[1:46:42] what you do is perfect
[1:46:44] i'm just here to manifest you
[1:46:47] lord have your way through each one of
[1:46:49] us
[1:46:50] forgive us lord for our failings
[1:46:53] forgive us for our wonderings and
[1:46:54] complainings
[1:46:56] take all that away from us now
[1:46:58] bring us into a higher level of faith so
[1:47:00] that we know
[1:47:02] who we are and what we are
[1:47:04] what we're called to in this last day
[1:47:07] help us to make that glorious stand
[1:47:10] standing against all the wiles of the
[1:47:12] devil and all the fiery darts and all
[1:47:14] the tricks and all the traps
[1:47:16] help us to stand against it all lord
[1:47:19] that was to stand upon your word and
[1:47:21] believe it lord
[1:47:23] god may we fight with the word in the
[1:47:25] word only
[1:47:26] may we trust in the word and your word
[1:47:29] only
[1:47:30] may that word manifest through each one
[1:47:32] of us
[1:47:34] god i pray you would take our lives
[1:47:36] and use it to attract the rest of your
[1:47:38] seed lord
[1:47:40] there's any more out there lord i pray
[1:47:42] that you draw them in by the light the
[1:47:44] light and the life that we live
[1:47:47] god may they come to you
[1:47:49] be connected to you
[1:47:51] so that every predestinated seed would
[1:47:53] find their way home
[1:47:55] or we just trust in you we give
[1:47:57] ourselves to you
[1:47:59] knowing that you do all things well
[1:48:01] and all things work together for good
[1:48:04] lord we trust you
[1:48:06] have your way with us lord let us see
[1:48:09] with a clearer vision moving forward and
