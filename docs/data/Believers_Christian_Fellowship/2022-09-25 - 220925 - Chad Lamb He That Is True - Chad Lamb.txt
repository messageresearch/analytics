would spent three or four days with us and went back yesterday morning and so we feel loved but Henry should feel more loved amen God bless you while we're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to Revelation chapter 19 and we'll get into the word all right Revelation chapter 19 and we'll start with verse 11. and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war so I'm going to key in on that title true he's faithful and true go back to Revelation chapter 3. if you would read one more scripture while we're standing Revelation chapter 3 and verse 7. excuse me chapter 3 verse 7 and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia right these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shuteth and shutteth and no man openeth and again not like the key in on the phrase he that is true let's bow our heads and praying dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for this privilege of being here and God our hearts are worn by your goodness to us so far in the service by the atmosphere that we enjoy as we come together for the saints that we can fellowship with for the songs that we can sing together to lift your name Lord seeing these two babies that you've given to two families to be dedicated to you Lord and the parents consecrating themselves to your service to raise these babies For Your Glory the visitors that are here Lord the The Retreat that's coming up Lord there's so much to be thankful for our hearts are so full and happy and rejoicing in you and now God as we turn our hearts to your word it is the thing that makes us happy Lord it is the your word is what gives us life your word is what makes all these things possible and Lord I pray God that you would feed us from your hand break the bread of life to us and feed us on this word Lord that we might gain strength for this journey that we're in take preeminence among us and take absolute control as we yield ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you as you're seated meant for a title this morning I'd like to take from this scripture uh he that is true he that is true and we know who this is referring to both references are to Jesus Christ he is called faithful and true these things saith he that is Holy he that is true amen this word true when you look it up in the Greek as an interesting meeting the prophet of God refers to this and we'll get to that in a minute but if you just pulled it out of Strong's Concordance and look at this word that that's true it means that which has not only the name and resemblance but the real nature corresponding to the name So it's talking about something that's true but it's not true as in true versus false it is true in the aspect of genuine or completely real amen or the full measure it says that which is not only the name and resemblance but the real nature corresponding to the name so something can have a name and a resemblance of something you can have a picture of me and if somebody says who is that you can say that's Chad amen but that's not the true Chad that's a true resemblance of Chad so you look at the picture and say that's Chad but when when I come on the scene now I am that which is true all right that doesn't make the picture false so it's not a true versus false this is not this kind of true but this true is not just that which carries the name and resemblance but the true nature that corresponds to that name so but the real nature corresponding to the name in every respect corresponding to the idea signified by the name real true genuine so now we understand what this word means and also in another description it says it contrasts realities where they're semblances so the true is the reality whereas the semblance is not the the reality but it is also true so just when we get back to like the picture you take a picture of me you have a picture sitting up here and say that's Chad that is true but it's not completely true but when I come on the scene you say that's chat that's completely true it didn't make the picture false but the picture wasn't completely true it wasn't the full measure now that we understand so now we know that Jesus Christ is this kind of true not true versus false but true in the full reality of the thing the full the full genuineness the full characteristic the full reality of what we're talking about so I'd like to read an excerpt out of the Philadelphian Church age from the church age book and then here the prophet of God begins to say these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense that it is opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization I was turned together to John the Gospel of John chapter 6. and keep your Bibles handy I want to read quite a few scriptures I may not read them all I might just reference them for time so that we can keep moving but I want to go through uh quite a number of scriptures uh this morning uh John chapter 6. John chapter 6 and verse 30. John 6 and 30. they said therefore unto him what sign show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what do us thou what thus thou work our fathers did eat Manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not the bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life into the world then sit there unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I say unto you that that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out so here Jesus is saying Moses didn't give you the true Bread of Heaven the true Bread of Heaven is he that comes down from the father and they said well let us have this bread they wanted bread to eat and Jesus says I am the bread I am the bread of life amen so now he's contrasting himself with the bread that Moses gave they're asking him for a sign amen because he broke the Loaves and the fishes and he fed the multitudes now they want another sign they want another bread and he's telling them then they're saying now give us a sign Moses gave us bread and he says but I am the true bread you want bread but I'm the true bread and that's why Jesus in the Passover broke the bread and he told him Take and Eat This is my body which is given for you because he was the true bread he was the bread that came down from God out of heaven now that did not make Moses's bread a lie it did not make Moses's bread false that was Manna and the Manna was given from God and the Manna Came From Heaven is that right and the Manna was the type of Christ amen coming down it was a foreshadow of the Son of God coming Amen to to be the bread of life but but now because Jesus Christ comes on the scene and says I am the true bread he's not saying Moses gave you the false bread because it wasn't false it wasn't a lie it was true they ate it it gave him strength it had the nourishment that they needed for the journey it was real bread that God gave to them and they really ate it it wasn't false bread it wasn't Wicked bread it wasn't the devil's bread it was true genuine bread from God but it was it was a foreshadow or a semblance of one to come and now the bread amen that this was foreshadowing was standing in front of them and he said I am the bread of life amen and anybody who comes and eats from me shall have eternal life amen all that the father of giving shall come to me and he that come to me I will no wise Cast Away you can go to him now and eat the bread not for an Earthly Journey but to give you strength for a journey from Earth and to the supernatural realms so now they're standing here and there's a contrast now this is the true bread and the word true is the same true that we're talking about in Revelation true not in the not in the uh differentiating from false but true now he is the the genuine bread the reality of bread amen the picture that God was fainting back there was him and now he's here it's not the picture of bread it's the bread itself it's the real and you know what they wanted to go back to the semblance he says the true bread I am the true bread but they didn't want to eat of that bread they wanted another Supernatural bread that God came down to sustain them and announce they want a natural natural and here he is giving something so much greater than the natural and they didn't want it they wanted the semblance they didn't want the true and it shows that he is the true he's the true of everything if you want to know what true is it's Jesus Christ he's the true of everything in figure me in church age it goes on to say since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before anti-type contrasted with type and the substance was Shadow take the example now of Manna From Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day if it was left around it became contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven wherever Manna was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus isn't part of God he is God Jesus isn't the partial he's not part he's not the second person or the or the a second whatever he is God he is the reality he is the true so now no longer would they need the partial because the full reality has come but it's not discarding the partial as wrong as false as bad it was good but now the fool the true the genuine has come and now Jesus was not in any way trying to make what happened in the wilderness he wasn't belittling it and he wasn't disqualifying it and he wasn't casting any doubt upon it that was real that was genuine that was God but it was pointing to his day and now to have the bread that came down from heaven would not be something that you pick up and put in your mouth physically but it would be something that you receive and take in spiritually and that would be the revelation of Jesus Christ as the son of God and now to partake of that bread you would never hunger again but because it's not a natural bread Jesus in no way means that you'll never have a hunger pain in your physical body again he's offering the real bread for the real life he's not offering temporal bed for the temporal life now we're coming to reality amen and you can partake of Jesus Christ and never hunger for life again because you'll receive life in him and if you receive him you receive life and you'll never hunger for eternal life again because you've received it by coming and partaking of Jesus Christ but you will get a hunger pain in your physical body again you will probably have one after church if you're a teenage boy you'll have one in church no matter how much breakfast you had but we're not looking to that we're looking to the true let's turn to John chapter one John chapter one verse one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness so John is a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but we know John was a light Jesus told us but he was not that light he was not the True Light he was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world this word true is the same true we're looking at he's the fullness of light he is the true light and now when when you look at the True Light you say in the beginning God created light he said let there be light and there was light that was true light that was a light that Lit the world and then he began to ordain the sun to Bear light by day and the moon and the stars to Bear light by night and that was true light and that was the work of God and God was doing and establishing the order of Nature and the Order of the earth that was true light amen we know that John Jesus says John was a light and you were happy to to dwell in his light for a time for a period of time so he was a light but now what's coming is the True Light amen every other light was pointing to This Light amen so now the sunlight that's been shining every day day in and out since God recreated the Earth amen that sun that's lighting is not the True Light that's right you walk out in the day amen and you see the light that's not the True Light amen Jesus Christ is the True Light amen amen so he he becomes the fullness or the full embodiment of lot light stood for what life when Jesus says Let There be lying amen Jesus Christ is that light amen the sun was showing for generations and generations amen what light is so that we would understand in the natural what light is what bread is what water is so that we would get some understanding but these things are only types of the reality they're only four shot they're only Shadows of the real so now that light that we enjoy every day when you go outside life is dependent on sunlight amen light comes to give life upon the Earth amen and we we know these things in the natural realm but they're only showing us that there is a true light that doesn't make this a false light but it makes this Jesus Christ The True Light none of us would go and say the sun is a false light you still need it for your Earthly existence we still need it for life upon the Earth and it will remain that way because it stands as a type showing us that there is a real light in that real light brings life because you need light for life and the Bible says he was life and that life was the light of men he was the True Light let's go to John chapter 8. John chapter 8 verse 12. then spake Jesus again into them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life just as light is required for life on Earth Light is required for eternal life for your spiritual life and Jesus is that light he is the true light or the Fulfillment of light or the genuine light back in purging me in church age it says no one could deny that Israel had light they were the only people who had light as a nation it was as when it was as when Egypt was so dark that one could feel it but in the homes of the Israelites there was light this is back when they were in Goshen but now True light has come the light of the world is Jesus Moses and the prophets brought the light by means of the scripture related to the relative to the Messiah thus Israel had light but now the Fulfillment of light has come and what was but glowing word has now broken forth in the brightness of God manifest among his people as the pillar of fire gave light at night and that was wonderful now light and life are manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily praise be to God he Israel had light no one can say they didn't had light they had the Revelation for their day and the Revelation for your day is light because light also is illumination amen when we're in darkness we can't see where we're going we don't know what's going on around us we have no knowledge or understanding of what's going on when we're in darkness if we're in a dark room we don't know what's happening in the room amen but when somebody turns on the light instantly there's an illumination and we have an instant Revelation and understand where we're at where we're at in reference to other things in the room what's in the room what it's like and we know so much the instant light comes on all right this is the contrast between light and darkness so light is an illumination that brings understanding our Revelation an awareness and knowing Amen in every age God was dispensing light Amen to the Israelites coming out of Egypt he was dispensing light and he was using Moses Moses was a type of the Messiah he was a prophet amen showing forth the true prophet he was a type of Messiah showing forth the true Messiah amen and they were in The Exodus Journey receiving a portion of light for that day and that light would give them illumination and they would see more clearly who they are now they know that they're the chosen people of God Amen they would see what their purpose is they know where they're supposed to go and what word they're supposed to fulfill and they know so much more than they knew before and in every Church age God has been dispensing light through his Messengers and he's been and he's been dispensing it through the apostles and through the the disciples and The Messengers he's been dispensing light and all of that light was bringing a greater illumination a greater understanding a greater awareness of what was going on and the purpose and the plan of God and who we are and what we're supposed to be doing and where we are in reference to the things of God all of that is light and and there's no way to Discount any of that line it was all real light it was all true but Jesus Christ is the True Light he is the perfect the real the genuine whatever God meant when he said light Jesus Christ is the manifestation of that right so we could impartial light there can still be confusion and misunderstanding there can still be uh uh all kinds and partial light are still a lack of understanding amen we saw it in the restoration of the Bride true coming out of the Dark Ages and the restoration of the church as the bride was growing in Revelation through the Reformation Martin Luther brought back the the the the the understanding of justification by faith in Christ alone and Wesley was bringing back the understanding of living a holy life Sanctified by the spirit and blood of God and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost was renewing uh the gifts of the Spirit and the life back into the church at the at the Pentecostal Revival all of that was greater light greater light Greater Life and it was all True Light it was all real light there was no reason to Discount the light but because it was partial light there was things that were left in darkness there was things that were left misunderstood right but in the end time amen when gone through a prophetic ministry will take the veil off the Bible and open up the full measure of the word and restore us back to what the what the apostles taught what the Apostle Paul taught in the beginning amen back to the faith of the fathers now there's no more partial he turned on the light there is a man here that can turn on the light and it's the True Light it's the full light it's the real light but you can never say all that was false light it wasn't false light it was true in every age and dispensation but it was all pointing to the true true it was all showing that this is a little more of the true but there's a full measure of true coming amen and then there's another measure of truth but wait there's a full measure there's an absolutely true there's a full measure of truth there's a genuine true and he is the he that speaks to you is he that is true Jesus Christ is the full reality of God he is the fullness of the word he is the True Light so there's no discrediting of the previous light but when they came to Jesus Christ wanting bread like Moses gave bread from heaven Jesus was saying that was good but that wasn't the true bread that come down from heaven that was bread that came down from heaven and it was true and real but the true bread that came down from heaven is me I am the true bread and it was a test to see whether they wanted partial or whether they wanted fullness whether they wanted what was true in semblance or if they wanted what was true in fullness and see man has always stayed in what's true in semblance because they like there's a certain portion of of living in the darkness that becomes comfortable there's a certain requirement that coming to the light has because when things are left in the shadows amen they're not fully aware you're not fully understood amen and there's not a full responsibility but when you come to the full reality to the full line then there's a full illumination and a full illumination brings a full responsibility to the full word so man will stick with the semblance just like if you take a picture you take a eight by ten picture of me and set it in my children's room and say this is your father it's true now you better shape up he's here don't this is your father obey well I mean that's a piece of cake it's just a semblance but when I step into the room now there's a greater level of responsibility because now I can speak to the situation now I can bring illumination to whatever needs illuminated now do you want the picture of daddy or do you want Daddy do you want a daddy entitle or do you want a real daddy amen do we want a god entitle or do we want a real God do we want a Jesus Christ entitle or form or tradition amen a token uh something that we can repeat and speak about that will that we believe will give us an entrance into heaven or do we want the real Jesus Christ amen the real true one that's true in every way because if we want the true one he brings with him an illumination and that illumination brings a responsibility because the true Jesus Christ is the word made flesh made manifest and he will bring light to every situation in our life and there'll be no more Darkness remaining in our life when the light comes this is why amen human beings love tradition they love ritual they love church tradition and church ritual because you can go through the ritual and be told that you get admittance into heaven because of the ritual amen but there's a real life Jesus Christ here today and he's here there's a man here that can turn on the light and if we come to the light he'll he'll expose the darkness not just the darkness in the world he'll expose the darkness in our lives because he's the True Light amen and when we come to the True Light then there's a responsibility of coming to the True Light because then he's exposing all the nooks and crannies cracks and crevices and those parts of our life amen that stayed in the shadows for years and we didn't realize there was issues there and all of a sudden when the light comes on you can see there's issues there and then we're responsible for dealing with them but when Jesus said I'm the Bread of Heaven he was offering them not enough energy to sustain them for another day he was offering life that will sustain them forever and they walked away from that disappointed because they didn't get a bite for their mouth it just goes to show that I want to be interested in what's real what's true not what's temporal let's look back at Revelation chapter 3 again Revelation chapter 3 verse 14. and unto the angel the Church of the laodiceans write these things sat thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God so here he's called the true witness same word true that we've been dealing with he's a true witness the the Bible says in John 1 that John the the John the Baptist was a witness to that lie he was a witness and was John a true witness who would agree he's a true witness but Jesus is the witness amen he is the true witness every witness Moses was a witness Jeremiah Was A Witness amen Paul was a witness John was a witness they were all Witnesses but Jesus Christ is the true witness he's the one who truly witnessed of all that God was and testified of all that God was because he was God God In the Flesh God dwelling in flesh God dwelling in his own flesh manifesting the life of God he is the true Witness amen we know in first John I'll just give you this reference first John 4 7. said beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love so we know that God is love and if God is love that's true love and if there is a true love then there which is not impartial which is fullness then there must be a partial expression of love which we know as filio love or human love the prophet of God says now as we see the law pass away and we see Justice if God pass away the sternness of his judgment pass away then let's look over here this is my beloved Son hear ye him what was it God's love God's love stood there represented in Christ Jesus Christ was the manifestation of God's love we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God but God's love is represented in his son he said hear ye him no matter what the law says and what this other says and what this says and what the church says hear ye him all other things pass away he becomes the culmination the full expression of everything and so now there is a true love which God is love so if it's God God is love this love is God then it has to be true love is that right but the prophet said endorsed to the heart it says how many really love the Lord just really love him don't care what the church isn't that wonderful at least 95 percent here say they love him what is God God is love he that loveth is of God now that isn't what we call free love that's Agape of love that's two different kinds of love and in the scripture there's two Greek words for love one is one of us is a love based on feeling of a feeling type of love between friends between relatives between relationships but another is agape love it's a different form of love and this is what he's referring to there's two different kinds of love one of them is a Greek word filio means friendship the kind you have for your wife love that kind of love that kind of love is not a true love did you hear what he said that kind of love is not a true love oh but we talk about true love amen and we write notes and we write cards and this is my true love and this is true love amen it is a true love because you really do love that person I mean I'm gonna ask for a show of hands but I assume 100 would say I love my husband I love my wife and you would say it's a true love amen but that's a love that's on a human realm love amen but there's a greater love that can even come into a husband-wife relationship more than just a feeling love amen can come agape love which is God's love which is a greater love yet and that is true love that is the love it hold that's the love that holds when you don't like each other for a few minutes that's the love that holds you know on a bad day he says that kind of love is not a true love oh I know you little teenagers want to believe that but it's wrong that kind of love will make you jealous of your wife remember I said it'll make you even shoot another man over jealousy that ain't real love that's filio love but agape love will make you get down and pray for that man's Soul that's agape love that's the kind of love the church needs that we all need is that kind of love the world there's love expressed in the world and it's true we don't discount that it's not false there's love in our families there's love in our homes there's love and relationships amen there's love between a man and a woman there's there's love and it's true and it's real but that love is only supposed to point to another love it's a semblance of the true love it's a reflection of the true love because the love of emotion of feelings it goes up and down as feelings go up and down Amen in a relationship you can and in a friendship you can experience love and you can experience frustration just moments apart you can want to be with somebody every minute of the day and you can want to get away from somebody as quickly as you can all within the same day but there's that's only showing it's a partial amen that can't be the perfect it's a partial showing there is a perfect and that perfect is God himself because God is love and this love that is God is a perfect love it doesn't change it doesn't Wane it doesn't go up and down with the times or or with anything God's love is perfect and God's love for you and I are perfect [Music] that's true love in Jesus Christ is the expression of that Jesus said in John 15 1 I am the True Vine same word true and my father's a husbandman he is the true vine amen and so if he's the True Vine the vine is what carries the life to the branches and we are the branches he said I am the vine you are the branches if he's the True Vine amen that means that the only place for a branch to be plugged into for True Life to bring true fruit is Into The True Vine amen they're they're not another Vine but the True Vine there's been other Vines there's been other there's been other systems that even God has worked through even gone even though God is above all systems amen there's been other Vines and God has worked through other Vines but now in this end time we have the True Vine amen and it's the only thing to be attached to is the true vine because from the True Vine comes the true life and if you're a branch tapped into the True Vine you'll bring forth the true fruit let's look at John 14. John 14. in verse 6. Jesus saith unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me that means he is the way every other way before him was a partial but he is the way he is the life every other life is partial but he is the true life he is the truth everything else is partial but he is the truth now I want to look at first John 1 for a few minutes if we go back near the Book of Revelations to First John chapter 1. read a couple verses there first John 1 and 2 verses 1 and 2. that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen him and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us Jesus is that life let's go to verse five same book first John 5 first John 1 or yeah first John 5 sorry first John 5 and 18. and I want to read this scripture carefully it's going to use this word true the same word and the same meaning that we've been talking about first John 5 18. we know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not but he that has begotten of God keepeth himself and that Wicked one toucheth him not and we know that we are of God and the whole world lieth in wickedness and we know that the Son of God is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life he has given us understanding of who's of him that is true that's God and we are in him that is true that's Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life if you're in Christ you're in God Amen and he is the true he is the true witness of God he is the true witness amen he is the full reality he is the truth of God Amen and and he gave us understanding of him that's true because we're in him that's true that's in Jesus Christ amen this is the true God and eternal life so if you're in Christ then you've come into the truth amen you are in what is true Jesus said in John 7 28 you both know me and you know whence I am and I am not coming myself but he that sent me is true God is true he is true everything that's true real genuine the absolute is gone Amen in Jesus Christ is the truth amen he has manifest to us to truth back in the Philadelphian Church age out of the church age book The Prophet says there isn't anything in this life satisfying as it may be as good and as fine as it may be but you will find the sum total of all perfection in Christ everything Fades into insignificance beside him oh let that be our experience let our experience be that we've come to the true we've come to true love we've come to True Life we've come to True Word we've come to True everything that is everything that the Parsha was pointing to we now have the ability to come to the true fulfillment of everything that the Bible every shadow every time amen every everything every substance in the earth everything that we look at has all been pointing to one thing and Jesus Christ is the truth of that one thing and we can come to that truth and partake of that truth and be in that truth amen so we'll find the sum total of all perfection in Christ everything Fades into insignificance beside him and Christ is the anointed word for the day he's the part that he's the word that has been anointed the light that has been called to shine in this day and for the Gentile dispensation we live in the day when it's not partial anymore but it's full light and everything else fades in significance everything else pales in comparison everything else Fades away because we amen as a bride have been given the True Light the true bread the true life the true Everything we now have and we can either enter in and partake of or we can stay with the partial but when Jesus was here they wanted to stay with the partial to stay with the religion and the order and the things that Moses had established and he says you believe in Moses he said if you believed in Moses you would believe in me for Moses spake of me everything Moses was telling you was me oh praise be to God let's go to John chapter 4. I love flipping between John and John so it's almost as if John had the bride's message John chapter 4. verse 7. yeah John chapter 4 verse 7. super familiar this is the woman at the well the woman of Samaria we we know this so well but in verse 7 he says there came a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith in her give me to drink for his disciples were going away into the city to buy meat then saved the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew ask his drink of me which I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealing with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith they give me to drink thou wouldst have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water they were standing beside a natural well with natural water and he tells the woman give me a drink and she said you know we're not supposed to be dealing with one another the Jews and the Samaritans why are you now asking me he said if you knew the gift of God if you knew who was speaking to you you would ask me and I would give you living water now he's not talking about what's in the well he's talking about true water true water the woman said unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from Winston hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself his children and his his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto him whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life now look what Jesus he's offering the woman a true water she's coming to get water because she needs water for survival but he's coming and giving her true water because what she really needs is not this water because the water she has now was never able to change her life she dipped and dipped and dipped and sustained a natural life but it never brought her eternal life and never changed her life she kept falling into the habitual repetition of a immoral life amen she was a woman who was caught in adultery and immorality and had multiple husbands amen but that water couldn't change her but Jesus was offering Living Water that would give her life amen then we give her everlasting life and not that not he said if you come and take this water of me this water will be in you amen now it's not just in me but if you come and partake of me the true water will be in you and it will be springing up a water of everlasting life so that you would never thirst again just like you said with the bread if you're taking the bread you'll never hunger again you drink of this water you'll never thirst again she wanted that water he began to discern her life she began to ask about worship and he began to tell her about those things and she says in verse 25 the woman saith unto him I know that messiah's cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her I that's speaketh unto thee am he and upon upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man saith what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her The Woman verse 28 the woman then left her water pot she didn't need it anymore she left her water pot and went her way into the City and say to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ she didn't needed a water pot because now she became the Fountain of Living Water she had Eternal water she had came and she drank and now she's dispensing the same water Amen to others and they're coming to him to drink let's go over to John chapter 7 now John chapter 7. verse 37. in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come to me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so he's talking of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost which will bring waters of everlasting life and Jesus is standing up saying come to me and drink amen he's not now referring to the semblance he's not referring to the partial he's not referring to the tide but now he's pointing them to the reality amen and can you imagine standing there that day when he cries come to me and drink amen he doesn't have a cup he doesn't have a gourd he doesn't have a bucket he has no natural water but what he has is the true water Living Water everlasting life the very spirit of God that he's going to put into his people amen he has the true Living Water and every time we take a drink to sustain our life it's proving that there must be a water to Keep Us Alive spiritually amen for Life there has to be water and if you look at what what what Jesus is describing amen what's described to us in the in the New Testament he's the true water he can give you the true water he's the true bread he's the True Light in natural existence nothing can live without food Water and Light we know the natural we live in the natural we're born in the natural and everything in the natural is pointing to something else it's showing us that there's another reality this isn't the reality friends is it a reality yes but it's not the true reality the true reality is beyond the veil of our eyesight but it's just as real as real can be remember Abraham he walked around looking for a city whose Builder and maker was gone he was looking for a City without foundation and the prophet of God said that city was just hovering just over him it was a supernatural Jerusalem amen it wasn't the natural Jerusalem there was a natural Jerusalem and it was real and it was true right Amen in the presence of God dwelt that when the temple was there and even if if when Solomon prayed when there was a natural temple built Solomon would pray Lord no matter where your people are if they get in trouble if they look to this building and pray hear from heaven and answer their prayer amen there was a place where God dwelt amongst his people it was true but it wasn't the truth because God didn't want to dwell in the temple made with hands he wanted to dwell in people amen and that Temple was pointing to another reality and the reality was so true and God would establish it that if anybody turned and faced the temple and prayed God would hear from Heaven remember the prayer amen of Jonah in the belly of the whale at the bottom of the sea he he remembered amen this this prayer of Solomon and he turned to the temple he's in a vicious belly he doesn't know which way the temple is but in his heart in reverence to the truth that God had established in that day he turned himself to that word for his day and God heard from heaven and God answered and delivered him out of the mouth of the well that's what the truth and the day will do but if that will work in a partial what will happen in a full-blown reality amen praise be to God if we recognize where his presence is to this day and we turn to him the word made manifest in our day the word that's on display today not what he was but what he is you can't you can't now turn to Jerusalem amen God allowed that Temple to be destroyed to be brought to Rubble amen first by the Babylonians and then by the Romans he and he allowed it and he said when it comes to the time of destruction of the Romans he said there'll not be one stone left upon another it was an absolute total Destruction amen because that wasn't the the truth it was true it was real it was the truth for the day but it's not the truth it wasn't the ultimate truth he didn't want a physical Temple that were made by physical hands amen Jesus Christ himself was the temple that was the true that's what the Tabernacle in the wilderness was pointing to if God just wanted the Tabernacle in the wilderness he would have preserved it to our day there would still be a tabernacle set up in Israel and we would be taking homage we would be saving our money and flying out there three times a year every male here to go worship before God but it was a semblance of Truth showing that there was another Tabernacle made of skins where God was going to dwell and we can turn to that Tabernacle which is our Lord Jesus Christ and be saved God is so good Jesus said in John chapter 2 destroy this Temple three days I'll raise it up again here's the response then said the Jews 40 and six years was this Temple and building and wilt thou rear it up in three days but he spake of the Temple of his body they were stuck in the natural and he was looking at the spiritual fulfillment of the word which was in him he was the temple of God and God was dwelling in him amen there was a high priest that God had established over the Tabernacle and over the temple worship and that high priest were the sons of Aaron and God established it were they true high priest they were true High priests but were they they the truth of the high priest no they weren't the true high priest because Jesus Christ is a high priest after the order of Melchizedek he is the true high priest so every high priest taken of man amen he makes offerings for man but the true high priest came in the form of man so that he might understand you and I so they might make intercession for us on behalf of us to God Amen and he is the true high priest after the order of Melchizedek which is an eternal priesthood so the priesthood of the aaronic priesthood the priesthood of the Levites then after the return on the Babylon it was all pointing to the truth of a high priest and Jesus Christ is the truth of the high priest so we don't any longer go to a high priest we don't anymore go to a priest for confession for our Pope or for he is the high priest he is the truth of the high priest praise be to God let's look in John chapter 4. this is still in the story of the woman at the well the Samaritan verse 21. Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers guess what word this word true is the same word we've been dealing with all along there are worshipers but there are true worshipers when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek as such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth he says there's coming a day and now is when the true worshipers there must be true worshipers listen the world is full of worshipers and I I won't even say that they're all false but there's got to be true worshipers there could be semblance of worship there could even be worship going to Jesus Christ even if it's a historical understanding of Jesus Christ it's still true they're still worshiping even a historical understanding amen there's worshipers but there must be true worshipers there must be that which is not a semblance of a worship or a form of a worshiper or a partial worshiper but there must be a full reality of a worshiper in this day one that'll worship the father in spirit and in truth not just by the letter of the law but by the very spirit that he's provided amen and come together with spirit and truth and not partial truth but full truth amen we live in the day of full truth and it's brought the full life and now we can be true worshipers with the full life of God and the the full spirit of God and the full word of God we have spirit and Truth so may God make us true worshipers in Hebrews chapter 10 I'll just read this one too Hebrews 10 and 19. having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart guess what we're true this is the same thing no partiality no semblance no type but a full True Heart with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised let's turn to Colossians chapter 2. he said we must draw near with a pure heart do you know there was a circumcision given to Abraham in the descendants of Abraham and all the Jews practice circumcision as a covenant as a token of the Covenant that God had with the children of Israel and so they would circumcise every male on the eighth day and it was a Perpetual Covenant but when Paul comes along Paul says that's not the true circumcision was it a true circumcision it was a true circumcision ask all the men that had to be circumcised after they came through the Wilderness journey and they hadn't circumcised an entire generation of men and they all had to make sharp knives and they all had to be circumcised in gilgal before they went to the promised land every one of you then would tell you that was a true circumcision they felt that they knew it it was true but it wasn't the true circumcision it was a semblance it was a shadow pointing to one to come and in chapter 2 verse 10 it says and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power in him also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off putting off the body of sin of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ so we are circumcised in Christ what is the circumcision of Christ it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's when God amen amen when the old nature dies and God puts his own Spirit his own life into you it's the circumcision of Christ and it's the circumcision made without hands this is the true circumcision the other was a time showing that there has to come a truth let's go back to Romans and read it this scripture again in Romans Romans chapter 2. and verse 28. Romans 2 28 he said for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is he that circumcision which is outwardly in flesh so that's not even the circumcision now Paul's saying that's not even it but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God so now if we're going to approach him to God with a with a True Heart amen we must receive a true circumcision and that true circumcision is the circumcision of the heart where all the things of the world the things of Flesh the things of the natural must be cut off and we must die to the Natural man amen and receive a spiritual life a quickening that comes from the life of God the quick and the inner man to bring the seed of God to life amen and that is the circumcision of the heart and that gives us a pure heart to approach unto God in a True Heart to be a true worshiper in a true God Hallelujah Jesus makes everything true just if you understand just bear with me for a minute in Christ remember Christ is the anointed word for your day in Christ he makes everything true so the presence of God makes wherever is present is true right his presence makes anything the living reality so the real living reality of God in Moses day was The Exodus Journey that was the living reality of God we know that it was partial it never came to fullness there was a fullness coming but it was the living reality what made it the living reality what made it the light of the day it was the presence of God and Jesus Christ is the ultimate of that reality God is the truth he's the true of everything he's the source of all true so he is the true and Jesus Christ is the true Witness God the manifested word the manifested word makes it the true word not just the word that's on paper it's the truth it's the truth there was a truth in the Bible of a coming Messiah and it was true but when the Messiah came that was truly true that was the full reality of that truth right it was true that a deliverer would come and deliver the children out of Egypt after 400 years and when Moses came he was that prophecy that word made manifest and he was the True Light of that day and it was true it was reality amen and when Jesus Christ came he was the light of that day he was the true he was the real so the word made manifest is the true reality we can talk about prophecy we can talk about all kinds of things but there's been partial there's been partial partial understanding it's it's all true amen but when it comes into full reality it is the full truth it is that which is true and brother bam says in the message it is the rising of the sun he said there was the first sheath come up from all prophets which was the Son of God the king of all Prophets there has been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there has got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride not that none of the others were not real Adam was given a real bride was she real but she wasn't the real bride she wasn't the true bride she was a semblance or a type of a shadow of one to come Abraham was given a bride amen Israel was the first bride it was all true it was all real amen but the real reality the truth there must come a real bride or a true bride are the full measure of what God meant by bride the full measure amen not partial anymore not not with partial understanding pointing to a greater coming not with partial life pointing to a greater coming but there's been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one there has to come a real bride at some point there has to be the true bride standing upon the Earth not any more partial but fullness said there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes the church live move in the power of his resurrection there's got to come one that's just not in term abide but in life a bride amen not in terminology not in a label not in uh uh uh not not in a a name or or an association but in a living reality it has not only the name of bride but has to have the life of bride at the same time there's got to come a real true bride and the message things that are to be so now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by the nominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living there's been Brides brides churches churches Brides brides churches Brides but there's got to come one and when does it have to come forth in the hour that we're now living there has to be a real bride there has got to be on earth in the end time a real bride there has to be a true bride not partial but true not partial in life but true in life not partial in word but true in word there has to come a true bride he goes on to say Martin Luther could not express the attributes that we express was Martin Luther bride he was absolutely bride where the bride in that age absolutely where the bride in the West Lane it's absolutely bright and the Pentecostal age absolutely they were bragged real bride genuine bride but because they were in partial word there was an impartial expression there was partial mechanics and partial Dynamics so but at the end time there's not to be a partial bride but there's to be a complete bride there's not to be amen just a semblance of a bride or a foreshadow of a bride are part of the Bride making up the bride Martin Luther was the part defeat Wesley was coming on up to the hand I mean it was a building back of the Bride it's all part of the Bride but at the end time we're not talking about part of the Bride but we're talking about a real bride a true bride the full measure of what God meant when he said bride let's look at Colossians again I want to read two scriptures together Colossians chapter 3 verse 9. Colossians 3 and 9. lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jewish circumcision nor uncircumcision Barbarian scythian Bond are free but Christ is all and in all the point of the Gospel the point of Christ dying amen was so that he could cleanse and purify a people so that he could dwell in that people the point of Calvary was a a price of redemption that had to be paid but the blood was shed and there was a sanctifying power that would come so that he can purchase and cleanse a people so that he himself could step into that people so that he could be all and in all amen now it's neither Bond nor free it's neither Jew nor Gentile now it's Christ as all and in all amen and that was the whole point but the first church left Christ because they left the word they left the teaching of the Apostle Paul and they took the ideas of man and started their own denominations and their own thinking and they left Christ amen and now Christ eventually became more and more on the outside until in the later see in church he's knocking on the door trying to gain access to his own church he's been put out completely how do you put Jesus Christ out of a church when you toss the word of God out you put Jesus Christ out because remember John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God John 1 14 the word was made flesh into one Among Us Jesus Christ is the word of God Amen and when you when you discount the Bible and you throw scriptures out you put Christ on the outside and that church that bride cannot be a real bride without Christ because Christ is the one that's true he is true he's all true every bit of him is true the full word of God with the full revelation of God is true it's the truth it's the fullness of Truth and if he's on the outside then that church can't be the bride Amen in order to be the bride we must have he that is true in the bride he must be all and in all and when he's all in in all then you'll be looking at the real bride the true bride not because she says she is not because she claims to be or bears a title amen that's not or be she Associates with those who believe they are that is not what makes her the real bride not of her own Merit not of her own works not of her own thinking but what makes her the real bride is when she's come back to that word and opened the door of her heart to receive all of Christ and now Christ in full measure is poured into his body which is the church and becomes all and in all and now she becomes the real bride what makes her the true bride the very person of Truth in her makes her the true bride not because she says she is not even because she thinks she is but when she becomes the Temple of the Living God when she becomes the Tabernacle when she becomes the dwelling place for the spirit of God she becomes the true bride the real bride truly truth of pride not on our own we can't do it on our own we must take him that is the truth and we must invite how do you how does the bride become the word by letting the word flow through her she must be the word because her bridegroom is the word and every brightest part of her husband Eve come out of Adam we have come out of Christ we must be word of his word amen life of his life Spirit of his spirit amen we we've got to be connected with him and his life and US amen we must be the dwelling place of almighty God and if Christ be in us and we be the expression of Christ then it will be a true bride let's look at Ephesians chapter one Ephesians chapter 1. and verse 20. verse 20 which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and he set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principalities and power and might and Dominion in every name that is named not only in this world but also in the world to come and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the the head over all things to the church which is his body so what is the body of Jesus Christ his church his bride which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so where will the fullness be and the end time when the word has come back the fullness has come back the prophet of God told us all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ is he's poured into the church what makes us a real bride because the true one he that is true has taken up residence in his body on Earth at the opening of the seals when the veil was taken away from the word and the Mystery of God was given to the bride it unlocked amen and Unbound and Unchained the Holy Ghost to come back into the church what Chained and limited the Holy Ghost partial word rejection of word refusing of God's word amen it was a chain that was binding amen it was limiting access to the Church of the Church of the Living God to the full measure of the Living God there was it was cut off amen by limited word when the word come back it broke the chains off and all the resistance and now the Holy Ghost is come back into the church again and what makes us a real bride is not because I stand up and say I'm part of the real bride but what makes me a real bride is the real bridegroom is in me amen the real bridegroom in you makes you the real bride what makes you true a True Heart A True Believer a true worshiper it's when the truth himself has come into you and living out of you it's not what we've done it's what Christ has done amen we we could never even come to God and Jesus says no man cometh to me lest the father draweth him first amen we can never come unless we were predestinated for known of God and destined to come and God had planted a seed of eternal life down inside of us something he could Quicken with the word in the day and we quit Quicken with his spirit amen and we have come because there's a peace of God on the inside that has the potential to live the life of God what makes us a true bride is because the true one has identified you before the foundation of the world to be a true expression of Bride not because we claim to be not because we line up our doctors not because we say I can cross the t's and Dot the eyes I must have I must come from him I must have his life quickening that seed inside of me it's got to be him in me making me a true bride if not I will be a semblance of a bride I will be a picture or a tie or a foreshadow and I don't want to be this generation foreshadowing a true bride that will come I want to be the true bride amen I want to be surrendered completely to him so that he can have free reign in me and live the full expression of what he always wanted in his bride it can't be me it must be him in me what have we received in this day the Lord has come he's come where has he come he's come to his body the headship has come to the body to what to bring life to the body what life true life true life by the True Life of Christ Corinthians 3 16 says no you not ye are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you second Corinthians 6 3 6 16 says in one agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God where shall I turn where shall I look to find them in my time of need what where direction will I turn East and West no by the end wanting of a spirit I've become the temple and he's in me and I can turn to the one that's in me and say God Amen I need you to help me calm my nerves and give me Victory so that you can live your life out of me it's no longer me it was never the temple amen if it was the temple there was a temple that Solomon built it was glorious it was made to according to the fashion instructions that David received amen it had all the best material it was the it was the pride and honor of all Israel amen but it was temporal only foreshadowing what would come God would allow it to be taken down burnt and destroyed and all the gold vessels that were dedicated to the worship of God he would allow dirty Babylonian hands to carry it away because God never wanted that to be the ultimate he wanted that to be the foreshadow and when that was done serving its purpose he allowed it to be destroyed so that we would never get stuck there to go to another one what did he want he didn't want a temple made with hands he wanted a temple that he made a body shall thou prepare me what body the body of Jesus Christ which is his wife which is the church that body is to be the dwelling place of almighty God gone have full reign in full victory in your body and the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says but you remember when it went down and the grain began to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in the stalk has to be dead so in the growing of the wheat plant amen it grows and it begins to turn brown because everything dies so that the life can go into the sea so that the seed went back into the ground it could live again all life is in the seed the rest of it's dead said Hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again we've come back to the Sea Jesus was the seed that went in the ground the first church died and almost died through the church ages but has come back again and the restoration of the Bride tree now it's seed again it's the original life come back life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus in Bride form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through all these and come out here and come to the head here Jesus is come when what way is he come we saw him in profit form displaying the son of man son of man is always a title of prophet and we saw him in the form of a son of man a son of man revealing the son of man we have witnessed them in profit form and that Prophet was also part of the Bride amen but now it's Jesus in Bride form the true bride every other bride they were true they're not taking it away but they were showing a greater reality amen Luther amen he was true bride but he swore he cussed his smoke he drank he he didn't have a life of Holiness it wasn't the full reflection of a bride although he was bright and he was true but he wasn't the true bride but now in the end time God has released the power at the opening of his word that word amen that word is not paper not print on paper it's a living reality of a living God it is the very thoughts of God the thoughts of God are power they're real they're literal amen amen and those thoughts of God has come on the paper now from paper into manifestation and the manifestation has carries with it the very life of God and the Very power of God this word has been restored it gives us the very power to become what he's called for us to be and in the last days there will be a real bride a true bride because it will be he that is true has United with her because the headship has come down and it's him directing her the head has connected to the body making this the real bride the true bride I don't want to ever lose sight at what makes me a real bride not because I recognize him in profit form but because he's in my form amen I can recognize him in profit form and I can recognize and I can recite things out of the message and I can quote scriptures Galore but what will make me a real bride of Jesus Christ is when I become a real Temple Tabernacle for the almighty God when I become a temple of the Living God and that full measure of that word is poured out and now by that power that's been released it's releasing me to live whatever that word the life that that word calls for both mechanics and Dynamics come together to manifest Christ that's what makes a real bride and that's the only kind of bride I want to be I don't know about you but I don't want to be a semblance of Bride a type of bride a partial manifestation of Brian I want to be a real bride and the challenge of the hour it can only be met by a true bride God has set it up to where this is the hour for the manifestation of the real bride and it's going to take his life unlocked at the opening of the seals back in a people to manifest himself again it's still him in her what makes it true because it's still him the true one in her what makes you true because he that's true is in you what makes me true because he that's true is in me if I want to be true of anything I must get the true that's everything in me and then I'll be true whatever he's called me to be without him we're nothing so he that is true has come he that is true is here he that is true is the true headship connected to the true body and the life has come down into the body and he that is true is showing she that is true his life in her the Bride In Christ must become so one that she's living his life and he's living through her until she becomes him the formation Jesus and the formation of his bride that's the hour that we live in a real bride a true bride and I thank God that I'm alive to see it I thank God that the true one is here that he's opened the mysteries of the Bible that is no longer which denomination out of forty thousand do we follow who's right who's wrong there's no argument anymore the truth is the word the words been restored through prophetic Ministry now we're not groping in darkness there's a man here that can turn on the light and that man is Christ Jesus and he's taken up his residence in his Temple he has come suddenly to his Temple and his Temple is his body and his body is his bride and now he's here shining the lights revelation 22 17 the very end of the Bible the last chapter one of the last handful of verses said the spirit and the bride say come that means at the end time there must be a bride a true bride a real bride to fulfill this scripture at the very end of it all that will stand and say
