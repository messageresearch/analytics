[1:46] child of God is the greatest privilege
[1:48] in the world the greatest privilege in
[1:50] the universe for all eternity there's
[1:52] nothing like it friends there's nothing
[1:54] like it it's God's choicing it's God
[1:57] pouring himself out it's God's family
[1:59] it's God's decision and God is
[2:00] orchestrating all the events and why do
[2:03] we just keep stepping into things why is
[2:05] it it just keeps happening to us how was
[2:07] it we bumped into the message why was it
[2:09] that all of a sudden out of billions of
[2:11] people on the planet we met somebody who
[2:13] would give us a message book how did
[2:15] that happen God was orchestrating that
[2:17] and how was it when Millions turn it
[2:19] away there's something down inside of
[2:21] you that would thump like that when you
[2:23] would read the word when you would hear
[2:25] the prophecy all of a sudden something
[2:26] in you would click and you would know
[2:28] that's nothing but the truth what is
[2:31] that that's not you it came so easy for

[2:52] that we've struggled with and Jacob had
[2:53] his own struggles but believing the word
