born to me amen God bless you this evening let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once again for the privilege of being here God for your call and for your draw Lord as you draw us to yourself God I pray that you would take control this evening Lord that you would take this vessel of mine under your control that you would take these vocal cords Lord under your Supreme control and use them to speak your words of eternal life God may you give us all ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that you're speaking to us in this day may we yield and surrender ourselves to you in a greater way and that you might have the preeminence you desire God we're looking to you and trusting in you and asking for you to come and do what only you can do that you might break the bread of life for us and Feed Us by your own hand we give you glory for this in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you all and while we're standing this evening why don't we take our Bibles together and if we could turn to the Book of John and the gospels Gospel of John chapter 10 I'm going to uh continue on with the thought from Sunday and this would be part two and uh unveiling the amateur Gods part two and we just pray that God will have his way there's several thoughts I have along with this thought things that I want to bring out and share so I just pray that God will have his way with me and then bring what he wants out and it may take a few services but praise the lord we would enjoy that amen enjoy en Joy hearing his word John 10:34 and Jesus says in verse 34 Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said ye are gods for he called them Gods un unto whom the word of God came and the scriptures cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemist because I say I am the Son of God Amen God bless you as you have your seats so here we know in the scriptures the scripture says in Psalms he was referring to Psalms here we read it last time where he says and ye are gods and you are children of the most high and he says is it not written in your law I said you are Gods so then Jesus is now saying if you call them Gods un whom the word of God came and the scriptures can't be broken then how how come you're condemning me cuz I say I'm the Son of God so we know that they're called Gods to whom the word of the Lord came Amen to the whom the word of God came and also the scripture just calls the children of God Gods amen and so when we talk about uh amateur Gods uh brother B uses this term over and over we would never be using this term if it wasn't for a prophet of God who came in this day and begin to show us there's minor Gods amateur Gods messes he he began to teach this principle and show us what our position is in the end time and so he came to take the veil off toak break the spiritual Amnesia to bring us back to what God always intended for his children to be sin had separated us from God's original intention and plan by bringing by by bringing his family to manifestation upon the Earth God had a plan he had a vision for that and sin came and interrupted that Vision amen but the restoration of the word through the Redemption of Jesus Christ now the Redemption cycle is going to bring us back to God's vision of what he wanted with his children upon the Earth he wanted Sons and Daughters of God and those Sons and Daughters of God are offspring of God so offspring of God can be nothing else than God's praise God Amen so that's where we get this term amen so when we look at this term we're we're looking at uh uh it's it's God Amen in a minor way or God revealing himself through flesh in a minor way amen not not in full measure he did that in Jesus Christ but God EX displaying attributes displaying himself in human flesh now let's go to Hebrews chap 11 and we're going to do just a real quick touch on a review of what we went through on uh Sunday and I just want to touch a couple things here and then move on Hebrews 11:1 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain Ain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and brother brandham picked this up and he says now how did God make the Earth this Earth that you're sitting on this morning people don't want to believe in faith how did God make the Earth he spoke it amen you see he spoke and the world came into existence in this world this morning is the spoken word of God and he believed his own word amen so now have a a principle of God that God Amen speaks his word but God also believes his own word and when God believes his word his word comes into manifestation so if that's what the major God or The God or God original does what should the amateur gods do amen they should be in the same image as their father amen he says he goes on in the same quote here it is watch it and if God and you're offspring of him and God is in you you'll believe his own word or he'll believe his own word though it can't be seen felt taste or anything he'll believe it see what I mean for God in you will believe his own word this is what it means to be an amateur God or a minor God Amen it it it has to start with faith but what kind of Faith amen it cannot be intellectual Faith or even human Faith but it's got to be the Seed Faith Of God that's down on the inside that's been quickened by the spirit of of God that can believe the word of God amen amen just like the father amen now let's look at Hebrews uh 11:6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so without faith it is impossible to please him I love that statement that's actually a huge statement and this is what is the death nail to religion amen cuz so many people are trying to appease please or appease or gain something from God through religious means or through ritualistic worship or through legalism amen but that's not what pleases God what pleases God is Faith amen amen and and Faith expressed is obedience to the word of God absolutely because if you believe the word of God Amen you will line up to the word of God you will obey the word of God Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments amen this is a this is fundamental principle theme if you believe the word you will surrender to the word you will obbey the word you will manifest the word amen but the core of it is Faith amen without faith it is impossible to please him again brother B says he just spoke it and it turned into existence speaking of God now he believed in his own word and if a man's born of the spirit of God he's an offspring of God and that part of God is in him and he believes every word that God says will materialize and and so that makes him part of God the holy spirit in the man makes him part of God Amen so The Offspring of God the children of God believe like God God believed that his word would materialize amen and The Offspring of God believed that God's word will materialize all of it will materialize amen praise God Jesus makes this statement in Luke 18 I'll just quote it to you it says Luke 188 I tell you that uh he will avenge him speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth the question is what was he looking for Faith amen it wasn't looking for a religious system because when the son of man come the first time amen there was a religious system there was there was a whole order of religion and they had taken the word that Moses gave them in the law and they had formed a whole order and a structure and it had everything amen but that wasn't what he was looking for he was looking for Faith amen amen when he returned this day what's he looking for he's looking for Faith praise God let's look at John 18 now now we're saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves is a gift of God the ability to believe is a gift of God John 18:33 then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me pilate answered I am I a Jew thine own nation and thy Chief priest have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king then listen to this statement to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth so what was his purpose let's read it again to this end was I born for this reason was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice so what was the purpose of Jesus coming into the Earth of being born in flesh in the earth to Bear witness of the truth because he was the truth he was the truth the way and the life amen he was the manifestation he was the full measure of the manifestation of the thought of God in flesh he was God in flesh he was the word made flesh he was the fullness of the godhead in flesh he was the truth fleshed out and for this end was he born and for this cause came he into the world that he should bear witness of the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice amen now if that was his purpose for being manifested than the earth what should our purpose as amateur Gods be in being manifest upon the Earth but we should be here to Bear witness of the truth if that's what God did when he came in the flesh amen he his purpose was to Bear witness of the truth when God comes into our flesh amen what were we born why are we here why are we born again what is God trying to do with us I believe our purpose in this end time is to Bear witness of the truth as amateur Gods amen he was there to subject himself to the will of the father to obey the word amen we are here to be Witnesses of the truth to do the same thing subject ourselves to our bridegroom bear witness of the word amen let's go back to John chapter 8 now we're still just reviewing John chapter 8 verse 46 John 846 which of you convince me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of God heareth God's words you therefore hear them not because you are not of God Jesus makes it so simple mean it it can get so complicated when we go into the religious Realms and this is right and that's not right and this is the rule we didn't follow the rule but this one believes it isn't I mean forget all of that amen Jesus cuts down to the chase amen you're you're if you're of God you believe God's word if you're not of God you don't believe God's word amen and Jesus was testifying of the word of God he was bearing witness of the truth so that when they were rejecting him he knew that they were rejecting the word they were rejecting God they were they were not of God John chapter 6 let's go back just a couple chapters John chapter 6 verse 28 trying to keep moving because this is review amen I want to move to the next part John 6:28 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God now here they want to know what is the The Works what can I do to please God what what is the works to do the works of God I want to know give me the list of things that I need to do what can we do to do the works of God Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that ye Believe on on him who he hath sent praise be to God why because God in every age and every dispensation has sent a voice into the Earth a representative that could catch his thought for that day and bring it to the people he did it through prophets he did it he did it in the church ages through through the messengers of each age God has had a voice on the earth amen an oracle a way that he can get his word for that day to the people and what is the works of God Amen you can say not smoking not drinking not running around not doing any of that that's that's all part of it but the core of it is believing on him who he sent what good is it if you never smoked a cigarette a day in your life but you reject the very voice of God for your day and call it something that's evil and reject it and say it's not of God but you never smoked a day in your life and you never took a drink and you never used a swear word and you never cheated your neighbor amen and all of those things are good amen worthwhile attributes things that we appreciate and value things that we should emulate as Believers but when you get down to the core of it what is the works of God the works of God is believing who God sends and if God sends them God wants them respected God wants them heard God wants them listen to because they're the mouthpiece of God to reject the voice of the mouthpiece in that day is to reject God because the mouthpiece is not bringing their own ideas they're bringing the word of God yes amen so let's go to First Corinthians now and and grab a couple more scriptures here 1 Corinthians chapter 4 in 1 Corinthians chapter 4 chapter 4 verse 1 1 Corinthians chapter 4 verse1 this is Paul now he's speaking said let a man so account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God what what was he saying Paul was saying we we are stewards of the mystery of God meaning that we are we are watching over we're we're taking care of a steward of a house amen was was like when Joseph was Steward in Piper's house he was taking care of the house watching over Distributing and dispensing amen things from the house amen here Paul is now saying we're stewards of the mysteries of God which means we're watching over and dispensing the mysteries of God and so what is it to do the works of God to believe on him he hath sent who is Paul Paul was one who was sent he says I have sent thee to be a light to the Gentiles now let's go over to First John we're going to look at the words of of of John joh over here in the Epistles of John in 1 John 1 John 4 now John was one of the Disciples of the Lord and me he was one of those the apostles who was commissioned to dispense the truth to go out into all the world and in in 1 John 4:4 he begins to say this ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error and you make a statement like that I mean that's a that's a very bold declaration I mean that's a statement that that that I mean I praise God Amen John could say it right John was one of the Apostles of the Lord he was commissioned by God God told him per personally amen you go into all the world and you bear record of the truth amen and you go and as many as believe in are baptized shall be saved amen if they believe not they sh they shall be damned God told him himself his commission and told him to go to do it when he goes as in commission he knows what the truth is he knows what his commission is and when he goes out as an oracle of God as a steward of the mystery of God and he dispenses that truth amen those who are of God hear him those who don't hear him are not of God why can he say that he's not looking at his flesh he's looking at the Mysteries that he's holding he's looking at the dispensation of truth that he has not in his flesh it has nothing to do with John the person it has everything to do with John the Apostle commission to take the gospel praise God praise God the same thing's true with the prophet in this day it it wasn't the prophet it wasn't the man it wasn't the one who was who was 5' 6 or seven Ines and from Kentucky that wasn't it that's not the thing that that's respected we respect the vessel but because the vessel was the one that God used to bring the word I mean it what it is it's a dispensation of the mysteries of God he was a steward over the mystery of God commissioned by God God spoke Direct to him and said you take this out to the world this is the truth dispense this truth just the same as he told his disciples it was the angel of the Lord that came and gave him his commission it was the angel of the Lord that revealed the truth to him it was the angel of the Lord that came amen and told him to reveal the seals I mean that this is God now choosing his vessel and God sending his vessel and now God bringing the dispensation of the word through that vessel and now to do The Works of God is to receive him who God sent amen and it doesn't it's not the flesh amen we respect that we thank God for that it's not the flesh it's it's it's what God was bringing through that flesh which was a voice he was the voice of God in our day hey praise God this is so important because we're going to find out when we get to the end of the message Amen brother B tells us that God once again has a mouthpiece on the earth there is a voice the final voice to the final age is the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we may have all kinds of fallacies in our flesh and we may be riddled with all kinds of shortcomings amen but it's not the flesh we're looking at it's the dispensation of the truth it's where God's voice is and who God has sent in this day to propagate the truth Amen brother M says in the church age book right at the beginning in the first chapter of the revelation of Jesus Christ he has this to say you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church in his Works in future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make the book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people praise God it'll take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good goes on to say but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know so he's coming to the introduction of the church age book and he's starting to begin the revelation of Jesus Christ which is in the first he's starting in the very first of the Book of Revelation which is the revelation of Jesus Christ the capping off of the entire Bible and as he goes in he says you're not going to get this from study and not anybody is going to understand this but it's going to take a special class of people praise God it's going to take a predestinated offspring of God it's going to take those who are destined to be amateur Gods amen amen it will require the ability to hear from God listen that's not a category you can put yourself in no matter how much you'd like to we can't that's a category that's been designated by predestination look at Matthew 13 together Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 15 Matthew 13 and 15 for this people's heart heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them I love this because it gives us a definition of conversion what it takes to be converted it takes the ability to hear with the ear and see with the eye he says less than any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart that's Revelation am and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear amen amen praise God if we're able to hear this message and believe it receive it as truth that's the grace of God in our lives if we can if we can receive whom God has sent we can do the works of God again in the church age book in the same chapter revelation of Jesus Christ he says as I have already said this book Revelation is the con consummation of the Scriptures it is even placed exactly right in the cannon of scripture at the end now you can know why it is said that Anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over over the devil praise God it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take away from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word see in verse three is a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book so I love that statement there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word but you can only receive the revelation of the word if you're a special class of people CU it'll take the ability to hear from God it'll take a working of the Holy Ghost it will take a SE Gene of God down on the inside it'll take all of this for you to be able to receive the Revelation but if you receive the Revelation this is what he says he says uh he said it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word so if we want Power amen what we need is the revelation of the word because there's nothing with as much prevailing power as the revelation of the word why did God bring the revelation of his word in the end time amen because he needed a bride that had overcoming power that could overcome all the lies and trappings of the devil and overcome hybridization and take a Rapture amen they needed prevailing power but there's nothing as with as much prevailing power as the revelation of the word amen you say I need power what we need to get on our knees and pray for is revelation amen God reveal yourself to me Reveal Your word to me open my eyes open my heart give me understanding and Revelation so that I have the power to overcome in this day amen it's not going to be will power it's not going to be mental power it's going to be the revelation of the word that unlocks the understanding that gives us authority over the devil that reveals who we really are amen this brings out the amateur Gods this unveils the amateur Gods our faith in present truth unveils our identity as sons of God Amen that's the way it's been from the beginning of time all the way through Abel was a Son of God because Abel could receive the Revelation for his day amen Cain could not receive it Cain could not even obey it he wasn't of God he was of the wicked one all the way down through the sons of God were able to receive the revelation of the word for their day and that was what differentiated them that's what unveiled them as sons of God and we know that sons of God are destined to be amateur Gods so what is the unveiling of the amateur Gods the veiling begins with faith the ability to receive present truth amen unveils our identity amen now I want to jump into the next subject that I want to look at let's go to Jude chapter 1 and it still has to do with the revelation of the word Jude chapter 1 we're going to read verse 14 I'm going to read just a little bit says and Enoch also the seventh from Adam Enoch was the seventh from Adam and we're going to find out that brother bandam typed this bride with Enoch and Enoch with this bride because Enoch was the seventh from Adam and so he was the seventh in dissension from Adam but Enoch was the one who took the Rapture and now we are the seventh from the last adamen in the seventh Church age and we're the one destined to take the Rapture so there's a parallel track between Enoch and the bride now let's go all the way back to Genesis 5 and look at this story of Enoch in Genesis chapter 5 uh let's begin in verse 21 Genesis 5 verse 21 and Enoch lived 6 and5 years and begat Methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so Enoch walked with God and then he was not for God took him so he was raptured all right so this is what brother R says in the message hear ye him he says every move of Christ was ordered of God and he walked before God in the way that he pleased him oh I would love to have a testimony like that and I'm sure that every person in here would like Enoch of old who walked for hundreds of years before God and he had a testimony that he pleased him Enoch being a type of the church taken before the the tribulation he was taken before Noah's Ark and the tribulation and all that set forth brother B was using that as a type but Enoch is a type of the church the seventh from Adam and the one that was taken in the translation before tribulation amen so that's a perfect type of us but we know Enoch walked with God Amen if we go back in Hebrews 11:5 you don't have to turn there but I'll quote it Hebrews 11:5 says by faith Enoch was translated so how was Enoch translated by Faith by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh the God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so Enoch walked with God 300 years after he begot his son Methuselah he walked with God Amen let's just read it again because we're still here in Genesis 5 uh verse 22 and Enoch walked with God after he begot methusa 300 years and begot sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so we know now in Hebrews that he had this testimony that he pleased God and then immediately after uh Paul in Hebrew says he pleased God this was his testimony he walked with God and he pleased God and then he says but without faith it is impossible to please God so what was pleasing to God was Enoch's faith in the word of God was pleasing to God and he walked with God 300 years and he was not for God took him amen took him in the Rapture and his translation was by faith amen his Walking with God was building faith his pleasing of God was by faith and his translation was by [Applause] faith hallelujah amen we know uh when God I'm I'm jumping around but just hang on let me jump yes just hang tight when Saul had refused to keep the word of God God had rejected Saul from being King and and he told Samuel I will choose a man after my own heart and he chose David and he says a man after his own heart and he tells him it's a man after my own heart amen and he's chosen but when we come to the book of Acts Luke in the book of Acts begins to tell us why he's a man after God's Own harm and he says when he had removed him he raised up unto them David this is acts 13 David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will so what made him a man after God's Own Heart Is that he will fulfill all his will well brother brandham told us what the will of God is he said his will is his word so that means David would do would keep all the word of God Amen showing that he had faith in the word of God because it's impossible to please God without faith so he was a man after God's Own Heart because he would he would do he would fulfill all of his will and his word is his will amen so brother Brenan makes this statement many many times I just grabbed one spot here he said what's he doing he's writing his first Bible he's talking about the Stars the placing of the Stars the first Bible was ever written was written in the skies the Zodiac it starts out with the virgin that's how he come first it ends with Leo the Lion the second coming and he's writing his first Bible the second Bible was written was written by Enoch and put in the pyramid the third Bible was written and this is the last one brother bam was patting his Bible God always does things in three God is perfected in three he's perfect and then in adoption 1960 he says the next Bible was written was in stone called a pyramid God wrote in the pyramids so now we find out that Enoch now remember Enoch is a type of the Bride so Enoch brother the prophet of God tells us that Enoch made that pyramid you know what I love about this message is that God sent us a prophet amen who could unveil so many Mysteries to us amen and he said now Enoch Enoch he made that pyramid and that pyramid is god's second Bible it's the word of God in stone form written in stone and brother M goes through all kinds of different types and we we might read into that in just a second on how it types out different things and the main one he uses is there's no capping Stone amen because when the Capstone came it was rejected and when Jesus Christ came he was rejected but he he says this in the in the future home this being this way would answer exactly Enoch's sign in Egypt the pyramid wouldn't it Enoch before the antoian destruction when justification was coming in he brought forth a sign and then this pyramid is seven steps going to the king's chamber watch on the seventh step if you ever studied the dimensions of the pyramid what comes out to take the oncom to introduced to the king watch those stations that is standing there and you'll see the day you're living in in the pyramid brother B said it the Bible's written out in the pyramid and when you go into the pyramid in the grand Gallery I've never been there but I've I've seen pictures and the grand Gallery the grand Gallery is made up of huge stones on either side and they spped their way to the top and there's seven steps in the grand Gallery going all the way up because there's seven steps in the church age coming all the way up to the king's chamber amen but the seventh step is a big step amen they call it the great step amen the not the seventh step those are seven steps going up but when you get to the top of the ramp all the way up to where the king's chamber is there's a high step you have to step up on and it's not an easy step to make it's a high step they call it the great Step at the top and brother Bram said at the great step he says in other places he said that's where amen that's where there's one to greet the comer and Usher them into the presence of the king amen and he types that with the Elijah Ministry that was in John the Baptist but also in our day there's been somebody standing on the top of that great step to help us up to step and Usher us into to the presence of the king and it's written in the pyramid and who told us that a prophet and you believe it amen why do you believe that you know how many people in the world don't believe that they see a step they try to figure it out seven things in the T that's yeah whatever but we had a Prophet come and tell us that and you believe it's the truth we do and you believe it has something to do with you and where you're at in this day where did that come from friends now when he ushers you into the presence of the king and you go into the king's chamber there's all kinds of things there I don't know how to discern it all I've looked at it I've got ideas but I I I don't want to venture without Authority so I'm not going to try to discern it all but when you go in there there they got what they call a sarcophagus there there's a there's a box there's a granite box and me but when you go in there's no lid and there's no body and there's nothing there because we don't serve a dead God we serve a resurrected Jesus Christ Our King is alive not dead amen then you go to the brother R talked about this you go to the to the top of the pyramid amen and he said the Capstone was never put on because they rejected it how does he know they rejected it because the Bible says they rejected it cuz when Jesus Christ came amen what was he he was the Chief Cornerstone they rejected it he was the capping off of the Old Testament brother man said he built this body all the way through the prophets he built it up through the prophets and through the Proverbs and through the Psalms amen but when he caught to the head of IT the capping off of the Old Testament they rejected that headstone but that headstone became the Cornerstone for the bride and he built up Seven Ages on top of this and then when he came again amen as The Headstone it was rejected by the world and rejected by the denominations but it was received by the by the people of God Amen that headstone has come and so now he he goes on here in future home he said watch those stations that is standing there and you'll see the day you're living in the pyramid now God made three Bibles now there's a pyramid teaching that's nonsense but there's a genuine pyramid notice now God he made three there have to be everything in threes Jesus come three times he come one wants to redeem his bride next time to get his bride next time with his bride see now notice how beautiful see and in the pyramid was seven steps and in the king's chamber and we're in the seventh Church age before the king takes his throne and remember the pyramid never did have a Capstone on it God's first Bible was in the skies the Zodiac it starts off runs every Age The First beginning of the zodiac is a virgin that's how he come first the last figure in the zodiac is a Leo the Lion the second coming just before there is a cross fish which is cancer age that's where we're living in now there was a pyramid after that Enoch which testifies exactly we wouldn't have time to go into it but someday by God's help I'll show you just exactly draws the dimension of the hour We're living why because the Bible's in the pyramid if we knew how to read it we would be able to read everything that's in the Bible in the pyramid the problem is we don't know how to read it brother brenham's not here we're not going to venture without Authority but what we have is the message and the message will unlock what's in the pyramid not that we have to go look at the stones just look at the message we've been given the the unveiling of the word the first Bible he wrote in the heavens amen now that's obscured to us because there's been a lot of lost information the Earth have been knocked off its axis all kinds of things we can't discern what's going on there it's been corrupted and polluted now the pyramid has been looted and there's been the casing stones have been taken off and all kinds of stuff has happened to it we may not be able to read that especially without a prophet here but this was his third Bible written out on paper and given to us but in the days we live in there's been a prophet who stood on that great step amen and God gave him the revelation of this entire mystery to peel the seals off and take the veil off so that we can see what's been hidden in this mystery all these years so I don't have to go to the pyramid I don't have to go to the Zodiac I can go right here to the Bible that's been unveiled before our eyes thank you amen so I'm not trying to get us to go look at the pyramid don't don't think that I just want to show that Enoch Enoch had the revelation of the word right and Enoch is the seventh from Adam and Enoch is a type of the church so if Enoch was our type the foreshadow of what's going on today Enoch had the Revelation he had the full revelation of the word because he built the entire pyramid right so what is the bride what is the church going to have at the end time the full revelation of the word amen in the message God's provided place of worship he says now we find out that Enoch came into God's provided way with his word and walked 500 years and pleased him and we find out that the mechanics was so perfect in him that when the Dynamics got to working in the engine it just took him off the Earth he took the first airplane flight like to Heaven working on God's mechanics and Dynamics together he was not because God took him out of the earth without death that's exactly right he was walking in God's provided way so what was God's provided way it was the word Enoch was walking in the word amen praise God now brother B says in again in in another message called God's only provided place of worship he says now let us look at some that has been quickened into this house of God of their age Enoch he says look Enoch was the Living Word of God of his age he was a prophet amen what was Enoch Enoch was Enoch was the Living Word of God for his age amen what was Enoch then he was whatever is wrote in stone is in flesh am amen he was walking with the Lord he was walking in the word he was the seventh from Adam he was going to be foreshadowing he already laid it he had already laid it in the in the grand Gallery he already laid it in the great step and in the king's CH it was already laid there and now he was walking in the earth fleshing out what he had already wrote in that stone cuz he already put it in there but now he's walking with the Lord and at some point he walks with the Lord as the seventh from Adam Oh my he walked with the Lord until the Lord was so pleased with him amen he walked with the Lord till the Lord just took him amen amen how did he please the Lord he had faith in that word he had faith in that word oh praise God see Enoch I just want to look at Enoch for a minute the word Enoch means dedicated Enoch was dedicated but it comes from a root word the root word of the word that makes up Enoch the root word means to train up amen has this bride been trained up over Seven Ages trained up to what to be dedicated dedicated to what dedicated to this word dedicated to our Lord dedicated to Christ and that's what Enoch was he was dedicated to the word that's what it means to walk with the Lord how could he not how could he walk with the Lord if he was walking out of step with the Lord's word amen he was walking with the word and as he as he walked with the word listen Enoch built the Pyramid so Enoch had a revelation right amen is that right yes he had a revelation of the word of God he had a revelation of the plan of God that and he also had a relationship with God CU he walked with God that's right I've been asking my myself this question which came first the chicken or the egg did he have a revelation first and then a relationship or for a relationship that brought a revelation I don't have the answer but the truth is he had a revelation and he had a relationship I I can come to that conclusion safely amen what is the bride supposed to have what is a revelation supposed to do a revelation should bring us into a greater relationship and a greater relationship should bring a greater Revelation amen these two things should feed off each other and they did for Enoch Enoch's Revelation didn't send him away from the Lord but Enoch's Revelation put him War walking with the Lord and walking with the Lord didn't give him the wrong Revelation walking with the Lord kept him in the right Revelation so what did Enoch have that we need he had a revelation of the word and he had a relationship with the Lord he was walking with the Lord so listen he had Revelation relationship and Rapture God what is this bride going to have Revelation relationship and Rapture amen amen amen I do know what preceded the Rapture I may not know which came first the chicken or egg but I do know the Revelation and the relationship did precede the Rapture amen and I do know that he walked with the Lord 300 years Andy listen so we shouldn't get discouraged walking with the Lord under this Revelation amen let's just keep walking with the Lord amen it doesn't matter if it's been 60 years since the prophet came 70 years since the the the seals were open it doesn't matter Enoch had a revelation he had a revelation of the word he even knew that he was the seventh from Adam he was now fleshing out that word as he fleshed out the word he was walking with the Lord for 300 years and in 300 years then the Lord took him amen so if we walk with the Lord 300 years under this Revelation we're still not out of kilter with Enoch let's not get discourage let's just walk closer and closer to the Lord as we keep walking with him day by day amen may take us a little more time to get into the step with what we've received amen what did we receive we received a pyramid worth Revelation yes that's right it may take some walking with the Lord to get this Revelation to sink in that's what Enoch had praise God brother bam says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said identified all the devil is howling about this the Manifest Ed truth of the promise of the word in her alone they don't have the answer when Jesus came why didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by he stood alone and his church stands alone this is a remarkable statement who took a Rapture with Enoch he stood alone it doesn't mention anybody else it doesn't mention his Partnerships it doesn't mention his church it doesn't mention his community Enoch walked with God he had a private fellowship and a walk with God between him and God and that that led him into a translation amen and that translation was by faith amen so this church stands alone she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body amen the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it so what is she she's the manifested truth of his promised word for this day she becomes what Enoch was Enoch was the word made flesh for his day she becomes the same thing Enoch was the word made flesh for our day walking with the Lord growing in faith growing in relationship growing in Revelation until when until these atoms change until Faith takes a hold and we leave amen now listen let's go to Amos 3 oh praise be to God let's go to Amos chapter 3 me this is really important Amos chapter 3 three I could turn there together Amos 3 3 can two walk together except they be agreed Enoch walked with the Lord can two walk together except they be agreed [Laughter] [Music] amen how how could how could the Lord come and walk with Enoch unless there was an agreement between him and Enoch amen what was the agreement between him and Enoch Enoch had a revelation of the word and that revelation of the word became flesh in his body and as he walked and fleshed out that word he was walking with the Lord and he was in agreement with the revelation of the word and the Lord could walk with him because how can two walk together unless they be agreed amen amen there has to be an agreement amen now listen I want to go back for just a second to brother bram's experience in Colorado because we talked about it before how brother brandham was In This Storm rolling in the situation was dangerous and the Lord spoke to him and sent him back into the storm and he goes back into the storm and and he's trying to sort out what's going on with the voice speaks and then he speaks through the storm and the storm obeys his voice this whole scene showing that Redemption is coming full circle and bringing back everything Adam lost back into the hands of not Jesus Christ virgin born but sin born flesh that's the fullness of redemption amen bringing it back to Fallen man and now he can speak the nature the way Adam spake the nature and now he speaks to the nature it does exactly what he says but then God makes this statement to him he says now he says uh I just stood there just looking around with my hat off the clouds had already went away I got num all over I thought the very God of creation it's all in his hands what's he telling me and I picked up my gun and I wiped off the scope and I started to walk to go down the hill listen I I love this I I said this last time but brother man is so human so real these things are real amen they're not religious fairy tales and they're not a man trying to make himself something he says all this happened and when it was over I was numb I looked around and the sky was blue and the sun was out and the storm was gone and then he didn't know what to do next he didn't have super understanding he picked up his gun and wiped off the scope and started walking back to Camp yeah amen oh praise be to God Hey listen we don't have to have everything figured out and we don't have to have a spiritual answer for anything sometimes something happens and the next thing to do is go back to stirring the beans for supper cuz you don't know what else to do get up in the morning and go back to work because I had a supernatural experience what do I do next what do you do next just pick up your gun and go walking down the hill amen if God wants to do something else he'll speak something else God amen amen the problem is we try to be spiritual we don't need to try to be spiritual that's something that happens naturally as we get in agreement with the word and just walk in our life with the word God will come to us God will speak to us amen if we stay in Harmony and unity with his word how can two walk together lest they be agreed but if they're agreed they can walk together so let's move our lives into agreement with the word and yield ourselves to him and give him a place where he can come whenever he wants to come picks up his gun wipes off the scope starts walking down the hill but God wasn't done hallelujah amen and something said to me why don't you stroll with me through the wilderness walk with me why don't you stroll with me through the wilderness walk with me brother said I said yes Lord with all my heart it would be one of the greatest things I could do was walk with you so I put my gun over my shoulder and started walking down through that never ax laid to it virgin Timber walking through there what was virgin Timber everything had come back to the Garden again virgin Timber the animals wouldn't leave him control of nature now he's walking with God just like God come down in the cool of the evening and walked with his children but how did he walk with them he walked with them the same way he's walking with the prophet I tell you what did Brother brandom see did he see a figure did he see a man what was the stature what was the shape you realize brother Brenham never told us he saw anything he heard a voice go with me back to Genesis chapter 3 Genesis chapter 3 praise God this is after man had fallen made fig leaves was hiding in amongst the trees in verse chapter 3 Genesis CH 3:8 and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden it never said they saw anything there was no Vis no form that they described or that they saw but they heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden and we know that he came down in the cool of the evening to walk was his children now they know he's in the garden not because they hear footsteps or because they see him they hear his voice walking in the garden and Adam hid himself and listen it says they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself he says I heard thy voice in the garden amen and it says they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the evening and now brother Branham is up in this condition he's in virgin Timber God spoke to him and told him to speak to the storms and move away and then all of a sudden he says why don't you stroll with me walk with me brother R said oh I would love that and brother Ram never tells us a man appears or a Visage of of an angel or something no he's just what's he walking with he's walking with the voice that speaking to him he's walking in the presence of the Lord he's walking with the Lord amen and you know what he does the next thing he says is and then I just thought I might go to that place where I remember my wife and he goes over Hey listen there he's walking with the Lord but the Lord's not saying anymore there's not a dialogue going back and forth he doesn't see anybody he's just immersed in the presence of the Lord walking with the Lord having thoughts about his wife and their anniversary and going to the little stand of Aspen trees and what's he doing he's walking with the Lord amen praise God Amen so when Enoch was walking with God it may have been different than what our imagination imagines because Enoch had the revelation of the word and he pleased God and he had Faith amen and he was walking with God for 300 years he was walking with Goden so does that mean for 300 years he had an appointment and every day at 5:05 he would go take a walk with God or was he walking with God for 300 years how was he Walking with God for 300 years what did he look like what was the form what was the description he had the voice of God he had the word of God the presence of God was with him and he was walking with the Lord for 300 years praise God so glad God showed us yes and a prophet amen amen visibly he took one man out of all the other men and he showed what he was going to do amen remember God does nothingless he first reveals it through a Prophet by a prophet so what did he do the prophet was showing what God wants to do he wants to do it in his whole body but he picked up this man first and he did it in the prophet to show what he wants to do what does he want to do he wants to walk with you and I he wants to live in us he wants to speak to us he wants to manifest the word through US amen I just want to walk with him brother baham says in the message Feast of trumpets he says notice the loosing of this ecclesiastical Spirit now 20 years later after the war we see the loosing of the ecclesiastical Spirit what under the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to the Jew look at the Moon darkening what under see it draw out the son of man being drove from the church what is it joining in with the ecclesiastical Bunch now the E ecumenical move with the World Council of churches has drove every man what does the thing stand for why you have to surrender all your Evangelical teachings and things how can two walk together lest they be agreed so brother Brenham this is the the premise which he takes for the the failure of the World Council of churches how can two walk together lest they be agreed he says they can't Jesus said they can't and how can a church the Methodist Baptist walk together how can the Church of Christ walk with the Presbyterian how can the Catholic walk with the Protestant how can Protestant walk with Protestant now listen what he says next but the bride can walk with the word oh do you want to take a little stroll today how many wants to walk with him in this end time message amen how many has heard the voice of God as he's coming back into his garden his bride amen how many heard his voice and want to walk with him but the bride can walk with the word which is Christ it must be an agreement not the ecclesiastical system but the word you have to agree with the word to walk with the word amen you have to agree with the word you have to believe in the word you have to have faith in the word because without faith it's impossible to please him and how can two walk together lest they be agreed but the bride can walk with the word why because she's coming into agreement with the word amen she's coming into Unity with the word she's received it by faith she's walking in it she's surrendering to it she's lining up up to it she's becoming what Enoch was in his day Enoch was fleshing out what was in stone was in flesh in Enoch amen and what is written in ink is becoming flesh in his bride it became flesh in Jesus Christ what is the bride she's the New Testament that's all that's what brother bam told us she is the flesh flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life she's the peace that was smitten off of him been formed through seven Church ages now coming back in the formation with the capping The Headstone coming to complete the image Amen to what to re replicate himself in bright form in this day what is she here to do she's here to walk with the word and flesh out amen the word of this day that word amen and how does she walk with him she must be in agreement how is she going to get an agreement it's got to take the spirit of Revelation it's got to take the spirit of God God to bring us into agreement with the word so that we can walk with him I don't know about you but I've heard his voice oh yes am as he was coming back to his garden remember the Song of Solomon amen the bride was called The Garden amen praise God a Walled Garden amen a sealed Fountain a virgin bride he's come back and we've heard he his voice I want to walk with him brother B said in the Rapture message he said but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that's the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture now it is a revelation for the Revelation is Faith and you cannot have Revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now Faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God and the Rapture will be the a faith it will be a revelation Faith to the bride amen let's turn together to first Thessalonians it's the last scripture I want to read together first Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 1 but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness amen you don't have to be afraid you're not going to catch the Rapture the Rapture is going on now the rapture's already caught you just keep walking with the Lord I don't care if it's 40 more years or 60 more years just keep walking with the Lord walk with the voice that has returned in our day walk with the Lord his presence is here he wants to walk with his bride and the bride can walk with the word but she must be in agreement with the word there's got to be a revelation that says that ain't nothing but the truth brother Brandon amen praise God and then our lives must come in harmony with this word why did it take Enoch 300 years Amen to take to take a Rapture Hey listen I don't have all the answers and I can't tell you but one thing I know that when his faith got to the place he was gone because by faith he was translated amen I don't know if it took 300 years I don't know if he had to spend a couple of th hundred of those on the pyramid first I don't know what was going on but I do know this that he was translated by faith amen and all that time walking with the Lord certainly can't hinder your faith all that time walking with the the the person of the word listen he knew the word he knew the revelation of the word amen and he put it in stone form so that stone was reflecting the word but what is the word the word is Jesus Christ he had the revelation of Christ and so what was he walking with he was walking with the person he had put in stone was real and living and fellowshipping with him and he was walking with that voice and then the Lord took him he was not for the Lord took him but Hebrews tells us by faith he was translated amen here's what brother brandom says says this all the way back in 1954 he says Enoch one day walked in walked like that he says there many places but you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore listen let's take everything we've been talking about tonight and put it together Enoch was the seventh from Adam foreshadowing the seventh Church age bride running parallel the seventh from Adam got a revelation of the whole word and proved it by writing the Bible in the pyramid and he walked with the Lord for hundreds of years and fellowship and Harmony and and and how can two walk together L be agreed he must be agreed with the word he was revealed to [Music] him and after walking with the Lord so many years he was not for the Lord took him but he but Hebrews tells us but by faith he was translated and then brother Brenham tells us that the Rapture will be a revelation to the bride so when you put it all together here's the man that's got the revelation of the word he's walking with the word his life is reflecting the Revelation that he has he's living it out he became the word made flesh for his age right amen he's fleshing it out walking with the Lord for 300 years but at some point brother bham says he got so far down the road yeah yeah listen I I don't believe that we're talking physical distance right I don't believe he got so far away that somehow while walking with the Lord on Earth he was now closer to Heaven than he was his house but he had got so far in his journey in the word and Revelation in the word and his walk with the Lord he had come so far till all of a sudden it hit him I don't have to go back I don't have to go back home I don't have to go back there I can go up now it's time I can just go on right now I've walked so long and come so far I can just go and the Rapture will be a revelation to the bride just keep walking with the Lord under the Revelation that's been peeled back the stones been taken off the cast's been taken off the revelation of the pyramid's been given to us the veil's been taken off the Bible we're the seventh in the seventh age we're the bride that's been called out of leoda we're typing Enoch now we've been dedicated we've been trained up we've been dedicated the voice of God we've heard in our day as he's coming back to his bride and we're walking with the Lord as we walk with the word let's get so far down the road just keep walking with him till we get so far down the road something strikes our heart and says I don't have to go back anymore I can go on home amen that's the day that we live in friends that's what God is doing in our day just walk with God walk with him in your private life every day of your life in your mind in your thoughts in your prayer just walk with God you don't schedule an appointment for 5:00 p.m. on Friday just walk with him every day every moment of the day not Sunday not Wednesday not when I play a tape but walk with the Lord and let that walk stroll you so far down the road one day let the fellowship just Captivate you the love relationship the Revelation the harmony The Joy that's in our let it get you caught up so far that you walk a little too far away one day and something strikes us and says I might as well just go on home that day is coming for this bride let's walk with God who's going to be caught up in that translation the amateur Gods they're going to take a translation cuz by faith they'll take a translation you know there was a time that Jesus when he was crucified he went to preach to the souls that were in hell and who was he preaching to brother B dramatizes it we can find in the scriptures but he comes down and he preached to those who were disobedient some days disobedient in the days of Noah what does that mean that means they didn't believe the word so he comes down there and brother Brenham dramatizes the whole thing amen but he begins to show that he comes down and says I was what Noah was preaching about I was what Daniel was saying I was and then he comes over to the elect group that believed him in their day first he shows himself to the ones who rejected the word in their day and he come to show himself as the word that they were preaching in that day I'm the Fulfillment of it all I was what no I was the ark amen that Noah Was preparing I was the law that Moses was giving I was the word I was the The Rock Amen that was smitten and provided life-giving water I was the Mana that they were feeding on in the wilderness he come to he come to seal their condemnation because they rejected the word and now he is the word made flesh who just died for them and he comes down to show them you rejected it but I'm the Fulfillment of it then he says he goes over to the realm of the elect amen and they catch a vision of him amen and Abraham says that's the one who met us on the plains of memory and Ezekiel says that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel that's the one we believed in in our day what did they believe they believe the word for their day amen the three Hebrew children says that's the one that was in the fiery furnace with us amen what was he he was the Fulfillment of the word in their day and he come down to say I was it you believed in me in your day come on boys let's go we're out of here what did they get they got a Rapture a resurrection and a Rapture and he took captivity captive and led them back home why cuz they receive the word in their day what was everybody else condemned for rejecting the word in their day what brought their resurrection and Rapture receiving the word for their day now we live in the day of the fullness of it all prise God God has wrapped it all together he wrapped it all up in Christ out of Christ came a bride amen she's went through a cycle of redemption but she's coming back to the headship Christ the word to what to walk with the word to live this word hallelujah to be the word made flesh and keep walking with that voice what is that voice it's the revealed word of God for this day amen keep walking with us his presence has come back to us keep walking with him until we walk so far down the road he just says green light you can come home now something happens inside of us says I don't have to go back I don't have to dwell in hybridization anymore I don't have to stay in this earth anymore I can go on home then we go oh friends what a day we live in don't look past and don't look to the fruit future just enjoy walking with the Lord when did he come to walk with them in the cool of the evening when did the message come in the evening time he's here Amen in the evening time to walk with you the question is why won't you stroll with me walk with me brother B said I would love to I'd love to amen you know what I want to say I'd love to I want to walk with this word that's been delivered to us I want to walk with this message not books and tapes the person of the word that's come and revealed himself I want to feed on him I want to learn about him I want to talk to him I want to experience him I want to walk with him and I want to take my change let's all stand together so say God bless you I'm so thankful for eyes to see and ears to hear I'm so thankful that God by his mercy and his grace he predestinated me before the foundation of the world and I had nothing to do with it I had nothing I couldn't I I I couldn't change it it's it's what it is and I'm so thankful for it it wasn't my Merit it wasn't anything he put a seat of faith and now I can believe amen and that Faith unlocks a whole another world to me and by faith I hear a voice and by faith I walk with that voice not by sight but by faith and that walk is changing all of us and To His Image Day by dayen let's just bow our heads and thank the Lord dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus God you left us an example in Enoch and your Prophet came and pointed us back and showed us that's our type that's the foreshadow of what you want to do today as you Reveal Your word Lord you've come in the revealing of your word to
