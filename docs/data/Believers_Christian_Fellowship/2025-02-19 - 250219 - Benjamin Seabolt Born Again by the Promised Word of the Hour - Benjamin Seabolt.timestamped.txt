[9:51] but together spiritually father around
[9:54] the revealed truth which we know that
[9:56] you
[9:58] are and we would just
[10:00] ask as we would gather ourselves here
[10:04] and sing praises to Your Name Lord that
[10:06] you would just be
[10:08] welcome that your Holy Spirit would be
[10:11] pleased and that you would draw nigh
[10:14] Lord Jesus for we know that if you would
[10:18] not make an appearance here this would
[10:21] all be in vain
[10:24] Lord but we know you well Lord for
[10:26] you're not a man that would lie and you
[10:29] you said that where two or three would
[10:30] be gathered in My Name Lord Jesus that
[10:33] you would be there and father
[10:37] we pray that we can invoke your name
[10:40] here this evening
[10:42] to make you honor that promise not just
[10:46] by verbalizing the name of Jesus Christ
[10:49] but by portraying the character of Jesus
[10:54] Christ here that would make you
[10:57] welcome father we just ask that you
[10:59] would come and have the
[11:01] preeminence we pray that you would just

[11:11] would you Minister
[11:12] Lord father I I don't even want you to
[11:16] help me Lord I just want you to do
[11:18] it we just give ourselves completely
[11:21] over to you Lord we ask that your Divine
[11:25] Purpose for this service would be
[11:26] accomplished as we yield to you in the
[11:29] name of Jesus Christ we pray
[11:33] amen God bless you Saints if you'll take
[11:37] your Bibles we're going to go to First
[11:55] Peter okay First Peter chapter 1 and in
[11:59] verse
[12:05] 22 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 22 I heard
[12:11] you all how loud you were when he asked
[12:13] if you were happy to be back in
[12:17] church so I have this Revelation that I
[12:21] want to share with you and then I'm
[12:22] going to ask you that question again but
[12:24] the way that I have this figure is if if
[12:26] we miss two services
[12:29] you all already know where I'm going
[12:31] with that okay never mind just pray for
[12:35] me because I've got a lot
[12:38] here 1 Peter 1:22 seen ye have purified
[12:43] your
[12:44] souls and obeying the truth through the
[12:47] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[12:49] Brethren see that ye love one another
[12:51] with a pure heart
[12:54] fervently being born again not of
[12:58] corruptable seed but of
[13:02] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[13:05] liveth and abideth forever God bless you
[13:09] as you would have
[13:10] your seats here this
[13:13] evening um I want to take a topic Born
[13:18] Again by The Promised word of the
[13:22] hour and I've got a lot here but I I
[13:25] don't necessarily know how this is going
[13:26] to go this evening because I don't
[13:28] really feel
[13:29] to teach this um but I just want to
[13:34] Broach this topic and see what the Lord
[13:36] will do and just see if he'll speak to
[13:40] somebody's heart here this evening on
[13:43] this topic but my maybe if you want to
[13:47] say my inspiration for this is we know
[13:50] we have to be born again we know that as
[13:53] a spiritual principle it's the very
[13:55] first spiritual principle that Jesus
[13:58] Christ himself taught you must be born
[14:01] again and that's a very common phrase
[14:06] but what does that mean what does it
[14:09] mean to be born again and if we must be
[14:11] born again how are we to be born again
[14:15] and just reading in this scripture we
[14:17] see here Peter is addressing this that
[14:21] we must be born again by the word of
[14:24] God
[14:26] but what word of God
[14:29] like Genesis 1:1 do we read Genesis 1:1
[14:33] and say that's the word of God and now
[14:34] I'm born
[14:35] again what word of God are we to be born
[14:39] to be born again by and if you've been
[14:42] around the message for any length of
[14:44] time we're familiar with these things I
[14:46] don't necessarily think that I'm going
[14:48] to say anything here that we haven't
[14:50] heard before but I just want to present
[14:53] this because I think a lot of
[14:55] times when you've been around the
[14:57] message for a little bit you take things
[14:59] things for granted and you start using
[15:01] cliche and catchphrases and you just
[15:03] assume that everybody knows what that
[15:05] means and now you have 8 9 10 11 12 year
[15:10] olds who need a new birth or even older
[15:12] who need a new birth and we are just
[15:15] throwing these catchphrases around you
[15:17] have to be born by the word of God well
[15:19] okay well what word of
[15:21] God what what what does that mean
[15:25] specifically and I am certainly not an
[15:28] authority on the topic but I just want
[15:30] to you know maybe share what's on my
[15:33] heart but before I do that I want to go
[15:36] back to verse
[15:38] 22 and this is a complete sidebar to
[15:41] where I want to go but it's I feel very
[15:43] impressed to say this in verse 22 it
[15:46] says seeing you have purified your souls
[15:49] and obeying the truth through the spirit
[15:51] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[15:54] that ye love one another with a pure
[15:57] heart fervently
[16:00] and I just feel to say this this evening
[16:05] that the
[16:07] absence of
[16:09] hate towards your brother does not
[16:13] necessarily mean there is a presence of
[16:17] love for whoever that's
[16:22] for we can
[16:24] take that stance that I love my brother
[16:28] because I don't hate him and because I
[16:31] don't say bad things about him even
[16:32] though I think them and I want to I
[16:34] don't so therefore I love my brother the
[16:37] presence of hate or the presence of
[16:39] attacking
[16:43] somebody I'm sorry the lack of the that
[16:46] presence the lack of the presence of
[16:49] hate towards that individual or the lack
[16:51] of the presence of attacking that
[16:54] individual that is still a far cry from
[16:58] unfeigned love of the Brethren
[17:02] Amen brother random makes a
[17:09] comment that if you have ought in your
[17:13] heart against any sinner any person
[17:18] sinner or saint that you are in danger
[17:22] of
[17:27] Hellfire so
[17:30] for anybody that thinks maybe we get a
[17:32] little too deep into stuff tonight
[17:34] there's just some just real simple
[17:38] stuff an unfeigned love of the brother a
[17:41] pure
[17:43] heart and now even magnifying that not
[17:47] just towards a brother or a sister but
[17:50] if you have a in your heart go look up
[17:52] the definition of what odd
[17:54] is it might not be what you think it's
[17:57] not a real big thing
[18:00] if you have awe in your heart against a
[18:02] sinner or a saint you're in danger of
[18:06] Hellfire I believe that that is the
[18:10] purpose of the topic we're about to
[18:12] discuss I believe that is well I don't
[18:16] it's not just my belief the scripture
[18:17] says that that is the end of the
[18:20] Commandment unfeigned love out of a pure
[18:23] heart that is the that's the purpose of
[18:26] the Gospel that's the purpose of the
[18:28] message
[18:29] you can't get to that point without the
[18:31] word of God it is humanly impossible to
[18:34] get to that point but I
[18:37] believe that's what this message has
[18:39] come to do I've said it multiple times
[18:43] and I'll probably say it multiple more
[18:45] times but brother brother brandom says
[18:47] this is a free age that we live in a
[18:50] free age and that's my my favorite
[18:54] description of this age because that
[18:56] means I don't have to be bound by
[19:00] anything I can choose to be bound if I
[19:03] want to be if you want to be bound by
[19:06] false Doctrine you can be if you want to
[19:09] be bound by a bad attitude you can be if
[19:13] you want to be bound by ought in your
[19:15] heart you can be but you don't have to
[19:17] be there has literally come a
[19:23] word literally came a word to free
[19:27] us from anything that is not like Christ
[19:30] so if we choose to accept anything
[19:33] that's not like Christ that's not his
[19:35] fault he has given us the pure word amen
[19:40] back to my subject being born again not
[19:42] of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible
[19:45] by the word of God which liveth and
[19:47] abideth forever in the token brother
[19:49] brandham says every promise in the Bible
[19:51] is yours it belongs to you when this
[19:53] token is upon you God has sealed you now
[19:57] we want to check ourselves for a minute
[19:59] how many wants to check themselves here
[20:00] tonight on the Wednesday night we want
[20:02] to check ourselves for a moment when God
[20:05] has give you the true baptism of the
[20:07] Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus
[20:10] Christ is within you so now we have a
[20:12] definition of the true baptism of the
[20:14] Holy Spirit equal sign the Life of
[20:17] Christ is now in
[20:19] you now that's true and every Theologian
[20:22] will have to admit that to be yes sir
[20:24] it's the new birth another equal sign
[20:28] Holy Spirit equals Life of Christ in you
[20:30] equals New Birth so now we can start
[20:34] defining some of these things we don't
[20:35] want to leave here tonight with these
[20:37] just being catchphrases and um you know
[20:39] cliches we want to have a foundation and
[20:42] a settl in our heart we know what we're
[20:45] after here the scripture says where
[20:46] there's no vision the people perish so
[20:49] we want to have a Clear Vision so that
[20:51] we know what we're after and that we do
[20:53] not perish he says yes sir it's the new
[20:56] birth you are born a new
[20:59] of the Holy Ghost Christ is the mystery
[21:02] of God revealed brother brandom says
[21:04] they're asking him the question well
[21:06] brother brandom what is the new birth it
[21:08] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[21:11] personally to you that's right another
[21:13] definition these are super important
[21:15] another definition Jesus Christ revealed
[21:19] personally to you equal sign Holy Spirit
[21:22] equal sign New Birth equal sign token
[21:26] amen not that you joined a church not
[21:29] that you shook a hand you done something
[21:31] different you said a Creed or promised
[21:33] to live by a code of rules but Christ
[21:36] the Bible he is the word that was
[21:39] revealed to
[21:41] you I thought you said it was Jesus
[21:44] Christ personally revealed to
[21:46] me and now he says it was the word that
[21:50] was revealed to you amen equal
[21:55] son 1 Corinthians 12:3 wherefore give
[21:58] you to understand that no man speaking
[22:01] by the spirit of God calleth Jesus the
[22:03] cursed and that no man can say that
[22:06] Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy
[22:11] Ghost 1 John 4
[22:14] 1-3 beloved believe not every Spirit but
[22:17] try the spirits whether they are of God
[22:20] because many false prophet prophets are
[22:23] going out into the world hereby know ye
[22:26] the spirit of God every spirit that that
[22:28] confesseth that Jesus Christ is com in
[22:31] the flesh is of God and every spirit
[22:34] that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is
[22:37] come in the flesh is not of God and that
[22:40] is the spirit of antichrist wherefore ye
[22:42] have heard that it should come and even
[22:45] now already is in the world this was
[22:48] thousands of years ago and and John is
[22:52] saying this is already working where do
[22:54] you think that's at now news flash for
[22:57] you Satan does not care what you believe
[23:02] he does not care what experience you
[23:04] have if you come within a hair a whisker
[23:09] and still fall short of believing Jesus
[23:12] Christ is come in my flesh he does not
[23:15] care right furthermore he will allow you
[23:18] to believe those
[23:20] things cuz he does not care because the
[23:23] scripture says that is the spirit of
[23:25] antichrist the spirit of antichrist is
[23:28] not to say Jesus Christ doesn't exist
[23:30] the spirit of antichrist is to say Jesus
[23:33] doesn't exist now yeah here there amen
[23:38] that's right he does not care how close
[23:40] we come remember brother brandom said
[23:43] that um 3,000 was added to the kingdom
[23:47] and Satan never never even he he I can't
[23:51] remember what he said but he basically
[23:52] he didn't blink but he saw Peter and
[23:55] John meet the guy at the gate beautiful
[23:57] and raise him up and realize that Jesus
[23:59] Christ is coming the
[24:01] Flesh and he had a big
[24:04] problem the difference two men compared
[24:07] to
[24:08] 3,000 he didn't care about what their
[24:11] confession was he didn't care about what
[24:13] their experience was what he cared about
[24:16] was when he saw Jesus Christ is now in
[24:18] the flesh
[24:22] again the scripture says that every
[24:25] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[24:29] Christ is coming the flesh is not of
[24:34] God that
[24:36] every also includes a
[24:40] preacher if a preacher is preaching
[24:43] anything other that then that Jesus
[24:46] Christ is now currently coming the
[24:49] flesh scripturally speaking that is an
[24:52] antichrist spirit amen regardless if
[24:55] it's reading message quotes or not
[24:58] this this is the scriptural Plum line
[25:02] either we're preaching Jesus Christ is
[25:04] come in the flesh and we're preaching
[25:05] the true unadulterated word of God or
[25:08] we're short changing that we're coming
[25:11] short of that and we're taking an
[25:13] antichrist
[25:16] spirit I don't want to be found on the
[25:19] wrong side of that line I want to say
[25:21] that he is coming the flesh I want to
[25:23] say that verbally and I want to say that
[25:25] with my life
[25:29] the scripture tells us that's how we can
[25:31] discern the
[25:34] spirits it's not
[25:37] going to be just
[25:40] a
[25:42] scary
[25:45] criminal that's anti- word
[25:49] Antichrist it's going to be a spirit
[25:52] that would confess anything other than
[25:54] that Christ can come in your flesh right
[25:56] now amen that's the plum line Colossians
[26:01] 1:25 says wherefore I am made a minister
[26:03] according to the dispensation of God
[26:05] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[26:09] the word of
[26:11] God I want you to notice a couple things
[26:15] and I'm really going to emphasize this
[26:17] as we go
[26:19] on but Paul speaking here says wherefore
[26:24] I am made a minister how many doubts
[26:27] Paul was a minister
[26:30] Minister we can all agree Paul was a
[26:32] minister no problem with our faith Paul
[26:34] was a minister according to the
[26:36] dispensation of God which is given to me
[26:39] do we believe that God gave him a
[26:41] dispensation to fulfill we're all
[26:43] comfortable with that Paul is Paul Paul
[26:45] is the first church age messenger he was
[26:48] ordained of God but now there's a
[26:51] change was given to me for you
[26:59] wherefore Paul was made a minister
[27:01] according to the dispensation that God
[27:04] had given him for
[27:08] me
[27:10] amen for
[27:13] me well Paul had this Vindication and
[27:16] that Vindication and what do I have how
[27:19] how do I know that that's
[27:22] me the same way Peter knew this was the
[27:25] Christ the son of the Living God Amen
[27:28] a direct Revelation from God himself is
[27:32] the only way that you can put you in
[27:35] that
[27:37] scripture It Go goes on to say to
[27:41] fulfill the word of
[27:43] God so let's back up and read it again
[27:46] wherefore I Paul am made a minister
[27:49] according to the dispensation of God
[27:51] which is given to me Paul for
[27:54] you to fulfill the word of God
[28:01] amen yeah Paul fulfilled the word of God
[28:03] he did a great job no you're reading
[28:06] that
[28:07] wrong Paul says I was giving everything
[28:10] that I was giving for you to fulfill the
[28:14] word of
[28:16] God even it gets better even the mystery
[28:21] how many believes Paul preached a
[28:25] mystery even the mystery
[28:28] which had been which hath been hid from
[28:31] ages and from
[28:33] Generations now we have to back up so we
[28:36] don't get
[28:37] confused Paul is saying I was a minister
[28:40] I was given something by God to give to
[28:42] you so you could fulfill the word of God
[28:45] semicolon even the
[28:51] mystery so I have a question for you is
[28:53] this mystery he's speaking about is this
[28:56] a doctrinal teaching or is this a
[29:02] people to fulfill the word of God who
[29:05] fulfills the word of God when they write
[29:07] it in a book
[29:09] somewhere and publish
[29:14] it to fulfill the word of God even the
[29:17] mystery which hath been hid from ages
[29:20] and from Generations but now is made
[29:23] manifest to his Saints
[29:29] it's easy to identify Paul in that
[29:31] scripture is it
[29:33] not but that's not the point that's not
[29:36] the main point of the
[29:38] scripture the main point even as Paul is
[29:40] declaring is to understand I've been
[29:43] given something for
[29:46] you and now this mystery that I'm going
[29:50] to talk
[29:51] about is going to be manifest in his
[29:56] saints Saints are people
[29:58] amen amen amen not just
[30:01] letters verse 27 to
[30:06] whom people people again to whom God
[30:11] would make known what is the riches of
[30:13] the glory of this mystery among the
[30:16] Gentiles Gentiles
[30:18] are
[30:22] people and just in case we aren't
[30:25] picking up on what he's putting down he
[30:28] clarifies it which is Christ in you the
[30:32] hope of
[30:35] glory this transition is the same
[30:40] transition that we have to come to and
[30:44] we're going to touch on that just here
[30:45] in a little
[30:47] bit questions and answers 1964 brother
[30:51] brandom says there's only one evidence
[30:52] of the holy spirit that I know of and
[30:54] that is genuine faith in the promised
[30:56] word of the hour we're all familiar with
[30:59] this only one evidence so we can take
[31:03] any other ideas we have any other
[31:06] teachings we have and we can get rid of
[31:08] them because there's only one evidence
[31:10] amen of the holy spirit that I know of
[31:13] and that is a genuine faith in the
[31:15] promised word of the hour I would think
[31:19] we could all say Amen to that we can all
[31:21] say we agree with that my next question
[31:23] is what is the promised word for the
[31:26] hour amen
[31:30] this is where brother BR says we need to
[31:32] check
[31:33] ourselves we can say Amen to the
[31:36] catchphrase we can say Amen to the
[31:41] cliche but if that evidence of the holy
[31:45] spirit in my life is only one thing and
[31:49] that one
[31:51] thing is genuine faith in the promised
[31:55] word of the hour I not only need to make
[31:58] sure that I have genuine faith in the
[32:00] promised word but I need to find out
[32:02] what the word for the hour
[32:04] is right cuz it's easy to say I have
[32:09] faith in the genuine word and I would
[32:12] never take that away from anybody I
[32:15] would never do that but my question is
[32:19] it doesn't stop there what is the word
[32:21] for your hour amen you say well why is
[32:25] that important
[32:28] 1965 God's only provided place of
[32:31] worship if I taught you a Methodist
[32:33] message it would take no effect on you
[32:36] this is bride
[32:37] time if Moses taught the message of Noah
[32:40] it would take no effect if Jesus taught
[32:42] Moses's message it would take no effect
[32:45] because the predestinated seed how many
[32:47] believes you're a predestinated seed
[32:50] because the predestinated seed are
[32:53] laying there that will only be watered
[32:56] by that type of water that's given for
[32:59] that seed that's
[33:02] right we know this principle in nature
[33:06] certain seeds come up at certain times
[33:08] they require certain things they have to
[33:09] be in certain
[33:13] locations it's
[33:15] not enough for that
[33:19] seed to scream and holler and Shout that
[33:21] he's a
[33:24] seed nobody's doubting that you're a
[33:26] seed
[33:28] but we're not called to just be
[33:31] seeds we're called to manifest and
[33:34] fulfill the word of God am so in order
[33:37] to come to what we are to be and have
[33:40] the evidence that we need we have to
[33:43] have the correct word the the word for
[33:47] our hour bring that specific seed to
[33:51] life again these are principles that
[33:53] we've been taught these are things that
[33:56] we have heard said but I'm just hoping
[33:58] and trusting that if I say it for the
[34:00] 225 millionth time that it'll ring with
[34:11] somebody I might as well just go there
[34:13] it's on my heart
[34:17] amen I've
[34:20] heard things throughout my walk within
[34:23] the message and I've heard it multiple
[34:25] times
[34:27] of
[34:28] that we've got to get people to Christ
[34:31] and then get them to the
[34:37] message
[34:40] we've got to make sure
[34:43] that people get to
[34:46] Calvary before we get them to the
[34:53] message my question is
[34:58] are they right or is the prophet right
[35:00] amen because the prophet said that the
[35:03] predestinated seed for this hour will
[35:06] only come to life and be watered by the
[35:09] water that's given for that specific
[35:11] seed for that specific time for that
[35:13] specific hour the promised word for that
[35:16] hour amen so if we are in this hour
[35:21] yeah and and we preach Calvary to
[35:26] somebody and they accept accept
[35:33] it are they
[35:39] bride these are hard questions these are
[35:42] uncomfortable statements to make because
[35:45] who in the world would want to be guilty
[35:47] of making light of calvary or detracting
[35:50] from of C
[35:52] Calvary I'm nervous just saying those
[35:56] things but we have have to come to terms
[35:58] with these with these truths
[36:07] amen if the death on Calvary was
[36:12] enough why did christ have to
[36:16] rise
[36:18] good right so if you just preached that
[36:21] Christ died on the cross and paid the
[36:23] penalty for your
[36:25] sins okay again far be it for me to ever
[36:29] detract anything from
[36:32] that but what if you don't tell him that
[36:34] he rose
[36:36] again are they
[36:43] okay what if we tell him
[36:46] that he rose again but we don't tell him
[36:49] anything about the promise that he made
[36:51] that he would come and be in US yeah
[36:53] right
[36:55] amen at what point in time are we
[36:57] presenting that seed with the word of
[37:00] the hour
[37:03] amen
[37:09] right the same thing applies
[37:14] now the word of the hour was not what
[37:17] happened two thou not just what happened
[37:19] 2,000 years
[37:21] ago can you preach this message without
[37:24] preaching Calvary absolutely not can you
[37:27] preach that brother the Brandon says he
[37:29] bled and died so that we could have this
[37:31] message right can you preach this
[37:35] message without the fact of preaching
[37:37] the resurrection that he came forth from
[37:39] the grave absolutely not can you preach
[37:42] this message without invoking the
[37:45] promise that he says I will not leave
[37:46] you comfort comfortless but I will come
[37:49] to you and I will be with you and even
[37:51] in you absolutely not
[38:03] but I take issue with the people that
[38:06] think I won't say people with the
[38:09] doctrine that think this is something
[38:10] new or that we're trying to do something
[38:14] new or change things in the scripture
[38:18] Paul himself said let us leave the
[38:23] principles of
[38:24] Christ amen I'm just going to read it
[38:28] praise the Lord it was the next thing in
[38:29] line therefore leaving the principles of
[38:32] the doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[38:35] Perfection
[38:39] amen was Paul detracting from
[38:46] Calvary I feel the tension in the
[38:49] air these are tough questions I'm sure
[38:51] you all have been part of these
[38:53] conversations but it's time we deal with
[38:55] it it's time we know where we understand
[38:57] that as brother brand said it's time we
[38:59] check ourselves it's time we know if
[39:02] we're going to say that we preach the
[39:04] message of the hour it's time we know
[39:05] what the message of the hour
[39:10] is therefore leaving the principles of
[39:13] the doctrine of Christ what was the
[39:15] doctrine of Christ you were lost you
[39:17] needed a savior a savior come paid the
[39:20] price rose again and sent his Spirit
[39:22] Back To You Paul says let us leave that
[39:26] Doctrine now now let's define leave do
[39:28] you think Paul is saying let's never
[39:30] preach that again let's not talk about
[39:32] that again it's like the scripture that
[39:35] says when that which is perfect is come
[39:37] that which is in part is done away with
[39:39] does that mean we just throw all that
[39:40] word to the
[39:42] side we don't need that anymore no it's
[39:45] just saying that is not the Focus right
[39:49] now when that which is perfect has come
[39:52] that which is in part is done away with
[39:54] is not that we W it up and throw it in a
[39:56] trash can is we simply recognize we have
[40:00] more yeah and we have moved in time and
[40:04] we have moved in dispensations and now
[40:06] in order to not be
[40:09] Antichrist and not not be preaching
[40:12] Jesus Christ is coming the flesh we must
[40:15] move forward amen we must preach
[40:18] something
[40:20] new this is what Paul is saying leaving
[40:23] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[40:25] let us go on unto perfection
[40:30] not laying again the foundation of
[40:32] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[40:34] towards god of the doctrine of baptism
[40:37] and of laying on of hands and of
[40:38] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[40:43] judgment that's a lot of topics to
[40:45] preach
[40:49] on and Paul's saying we've discussed
[40:52] that we've taught that and that's not
[40:55] going to bring you to perfection yeah
[40:57] let's go amen we have something else to
[41:01] talk
[41:02] about
[41:06] so that's not a
[41:08] new discussion I'm sure there were
[41:11] people in Paul's age that was like oh
[41:13] who whoa whoa whoa
[41:17] whoa let's not get carried away here
[41:21] right but that spirit is real that
[41:25] spirit is so real that I'm fighting it
[41:26] right now just saying these
[41:35] things are we just going to continue to
[41:37] sweep it under the rug or are we going
[41:39] to check ourselves and know where we
[41:42] stand are we going to keep avoiding
[41:45] those
[41:47] conversations or are we going to check
[41:49] ourselves and know what the promised
[41:50] word for the hour is and know that it's
[41:53] okay to say that we've moved past
[41:55] Calvary
[41:59] is it okay to say
[42:03] that is it
[42:05] okay to say that
[42:08] we've furthered past the resurrection of
[42:11] Jesus Christ 2,000 years
[42:16] ago is it okay to say that we have moved
[42:20] past the baptism of the Holy
[42:24] Spirit and are now walking in the person
[42:26] of Christ
[42:33] himself you don't have to answer just
[42:35] think about it that's all I'm asking you
[42:36] to do is think about it I'm not asking
[42:39] you to jump up and down and scream
[42:42] hallelujah it's
[42:44] uncomfortable but let's face the fact
[42:46] that it's
[42:47] uncomfortable and let's find out what we
[42:49] can do to know where we stand so that
[42:50] it's not uncomfortable
[43:03] I'm going to keep keep talking about it
[43:04] until it leaves I'm
[43:09] sorry the reason I have a problem with
[43:12] that is it keeps our young people young
[43:15] people from coming to a new birth am
[43:17] yeah
[43:30] we might not go any further
[43:33] tonight but I've got a problem with that
[43:37] spirit and that's why I've got a problem
[43:40] with it is because brother brandom says
[43:42] the deception in this
[43:44] age is to make Satan has come to make
[43:48] you think you're saved when you're
[43:51] not
[43:52] right that's the deception for this age
[43:59] amen so how do we combat that deception
[44:03] for this age we can only combat that
[44:06] with the pure word of God for this hour
[44:09] amen and the pure word of God for this
[44:12] hour is not just that Jesus Christ died
[44:14] on a cross 2,000 years ago and that he
[44:18] Resurrection resurrected and that he
[44:20] sent his holy spirit
[44:23] back if you are living in this
[44:25] chronological time
[44:27] that is not the only message for your
[44:31] age the message for your age is that
[44:34] Jesus Christ is come in the
[44:36] flesh your
[44:40] flesh
[44:42] Perfection we're not living in a
[44:45] justification
[44:47] age if we were living in Luther's age it
[44:50] would be okay just to preach that the
[44:52] penalty has been paid and faith in that
[44:55] penalty suffices
[44:57] if we were living in Wesley's age it
[44:59] would be okay just to preach to believe
[45:02] that the penalty has been paid and faith
[45:04] in that penalty can now bring me to a
[45:07] Sanctified life if we were living in a
[45:10] Pentecostal age it would be okay to
[45:12] believe that the restoration of the
[45:14] baptism of the Holy Spirit has been
[45:19] restored but you don't live in that
[45:22] age therefore if you come
[45:25] short of
[45:28] preaching and believing and living that
[45:32] Jesus Christ is now come in your flesh
[45:35] not in
[45:36] partiality in the
[45:39] fullness the fullness of the word that
[45:41] has
[45:43] returned and that is now living in my
[45:47] flesh we've come up short
[45:55] amen and it's e
[45:59] easy for the young people to go down and
[46:02] start checking the boxes yeah I believe
[46:04] he died yeah I believe he resurrected
[46:06] yeah I believe he sent his
[46:10] Spirit but what about is he living in
[46:13] your
[46:15] flesh what about Jesus Christ is
[46:18] literally walking the Earth in this age
[46:20] and in this day and time in my
[46:23] flesh that's the promised word of the
[46:25] hour amen
[46:28] I'm not saying you're going to come to
[46:30] that overnight and I'm not saying you
[46:31] don't need to go through a process I'm
[46:34] just saying as Paul said let us leave
[46:37] leave is not forsake it leave is meaning
[46:40] let's move
[46:42] forward right let's move forward let's
[46:45] keep
[46:47] going not forsaking those
[46:50] things I mean how silly would it be to
[46:53] get to the end of the road and say I
[46:54] believe the message of the of the hour
[46:57] and that Jesus Christ is living in My
[47:00] Flesh and then you show up and be like
[47:04] well I don't even believe there was a
[47:06] penalty paid for my sins I believe all
[47:08] this I mean that doesn't even make good
[47:11] sense if there's not a penalty paid for
[47:15] me as a sinner I'm toast it doesn't
[47:18] matter what I
[47:19] believe but the the age the day and the
[47:23] age that I live in requires something
[47:25] more
[47:33] and this has always been the
[47:35] argument this has always been the
[47:37] argument back over time
[47:40] remember remember what they confronted
[47:42] Jesus with he's trying to further the
[47:45] kingdom of God to them and reveal to
[47:48] them who he is Jesus Christ Has Come In
[47:50] the Flesh and they say we've got
[47:52] Moses amen
[47:59] see young people Satan is not going to
[48:01] come to you and say you don't have no
[48:03] experience at
[48:05] all he's going to come to you and make
[48:07] you justify your present
[48:12] condition and I assure you he's not
[48:15] going to encourage you to move forward
[48:18] into Jesus Christ is now come in my
[48:20] flesh
[48:28] the reason I'm laboring on this is I
[48:30] don't want to be
[48:32] guilty because if in my
[48:36] heart I have a burden and a cry not just
[48:39] for the young people but anybody under
[48:41] the banner of this message to come to
[48:43] the fullness of its potential if I have
[48:46] that
[48:48] burden how can
[48:50] I leave them in a present condition that
[48:55] is short of the full word of God for the
[48:58] hour
[49:02] amen I hope this is making sense to
[49:09] somebody how can we want our children to
[49:12] be borned
[49:14] again but we won't give them the full
[49:17] word to be born again
[49:29] and the full present tense word is
[49:32] always
[49:36] uncomfortable it always has been
[49:49] uncomfortable if we want new births how
[49:53] many want new
[49:55] births how many have a burden for new
[49:59] births not just your own but if you have
[50:01] been born again for
[50:05] others for our
[50:10] children if we if we have that burden
[50:15] and we want that result we have to water
[50:19] that seed with the right water and put
[50:22] it under the right conditions and the
[50:24] right conditions is preaching the right
[50:26] right word over top of it
[50:30] am and that will never come to fruition
[50:34] preaching a past tense gospel
[50:40] right and again I'm not saying that we
[50:44] we bypass any of the
[50:46] fundamental steps of our faith I think
[50:50] you all know me better than
[50:55] that but we
[50:58] we as the prophet says he said Pentecost
[51:02] cabbage
[51:03] down on the baptism of the Holy
[51:07] Spirit
[51:10] really the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[51:13] they cabbage down on it I mean what a
[51:15] thing to cabbage down on I thought if I
[51:17] had the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'd
[51:19] be
[51:22] okay but he said that not me
[51:26] prise God so if you can cabbage down on
[51:29] the baptism of the Holy Spirit can you
[51:31] not cabbage down on
[51:33] justification and on sanctification
[51:38] right and on God sent a prophet for this
[51:43] age and whatever I believe everything he
[51:46] said we so easily make these statements
[51:49] but do you even know what he said we can
[51:52] make a statement I believe everything
[51:53] that he said really what you're doing is
[51:55] just admitting that he is the authority
[51:58] and that's fine like that's step number
[52:00] one we got to get past that a lot of
[52:01] people
[52:02] haven't but just saying I believe
[52:04] everything that he said recognizing him
[52:07] as the authority and not knowing what he
[52:09] said to apply it to your
[52:11] life does that really do you any
[52:17] good there's going to be a lot of people
[52:20] on Judgment
[52:23] Day not arguing who the author it for
[52:27] this age
[52:30] was Satan's going to be right there with
[52:33] them Satan knows God sent a prophet yeah
[52:37] Satan knows who the Authority for this
[52:38] age
[52:40] was is that the promised word for the
[52:43] hour
[52:52] then I'm not trying to be dogmatic on it
[52:58] but I've just seen it for too many
[53:07] years this message is
[53:11] Christ amen he bled and died for this
[53:18] message if he bled and died for this
[53:22] message which did he feel was more
[53:24] important amen right so why would we be
[53:29] ashamed to say that we've come past the
[53:32] penalty that was
[53:34] paid he's the one himself who said
[53:37] that's more important I'm going to lay
[53:40] my life down for it right would it not
[53:43] be an insult to him to just say we're
[53:45] going to stay here we're going to stay
[53:47] here and preach the penalty's been paid
[53:49] the penalty's been paid the penalty's
[53:51] been
[53:54] paid and
[53:57] you know what that's equivalent to
[53:58] that's equivalent to going to the pawn
[54:01] shop giving the guy the $100 for
[54:04] whatever it is you pawned and then been
[54:07] like see you
[54:08] later that's
[54:10] right the price has been
[54:13] paid you've still got to take it you've
[54:17] got to claim it which was more important
[54:20] the $100 or the item that you gave the
[54:22] $100
[54:24] for that's right
[54:27] this is the same
[54:29] principle and I've got the prophet to
[54:31] back it up he says not Calvary was the
[54:34] most Sublime portion of scripture but
[54:36] Revelation 55 was the most Sublime
[54:38] portion of scripture why because he knew
[54:41] the principle the price has been paid
[54:43] but if you don't take that which you've
[54:45] paid for why pay the price for it that's
[54:48] right why leave it in the pawn shop
[55:00] I don't want to be
[55:05] guilty I don't want to be guilty of not
[55:07] preaching the most Sublime portion of
[55:09] scripture and saying that that is the
[55:10] word for the
[55:12] yah and that anything short of that is
[55:19] Antichrist that's what the scripture
[55:22] says anything short of Jesus Christ is
[55:26] come in the flesh is of an antichrist
[55:33] Spirit they're still going to be
[55:35] preaching some type of
[55:39] Christ and when I say they I'm not
[55:42] speaking of any certain individuals I'm
[55:44] saying the spirits the 200,000,000
[55:48] demons that were
[55:51] released they're not going to come to
[55:53] you message
[55:55] kids young
[55:58] people with Gothic
[56:03] Doctrine I'll tell you what Doctrine
[56:05] they're going to come to you
[56:07] with is that you're
[56:12] okay just the way you are don't go any
[56:15] farther certainly don't go poking around
[56:18] in the Book of
[56:19] Revelation and seeing that there's been
[56:22] a book to claimed and certainly don't
[56:24] believe that you're that book
[56:29] and certainly don't believe that that
[56:30] was the whole
[56:32] purpose that the seventh angel was
[56:34] sent the purpose of that was you could
[56:37] say he's the seventh angel whatever he
[56:39] says is correct and if you live it okay
[56:42] if you don't just say it's
[56:52] correct if we want new births out of our
[56:54] children we better give them them the
[56:56] promised word for the hour if we want
[56:59] new births under our ministry we better
[57:01] preach the promised word of the
[57:03] hour if we don't preach the promised
[57:06] word of the hour we find oursel being
[57:08] Antichrist preaching a Christ but not
[57:12] Jesus
[57:18] Christ that's my
[57:24] burden if we want want
[57:27] something we have to meet the
[57:29] requirement for
[57:31] that even if it's
[57:38] uncomfortable we've got to be
[57:39] comfortable telling our children and our
[57:41] young
[57:43] people then anything short of perfection
[57:46] is not the message of the hour anything
[57:48] short of Jesus Christ himself revealing
[57:51] himself through your being is not the
[57:54] message of the hour amen
[57:58] do we detract from anything that's
[58:00] happened absolutely
[58:05] not but we can't have a burden for
[58:08] something and want
[58:11] something and not be able to tell the
[58:16] truth just
[58:19] because somebody might not understand or
[58:21] somebody might be offended don't do it
[58:24] in an offensive way if you're doing it
[58:25] to be offensive you're wrong in the
[58:27] first
[58:29] place but we can't detract from the
[58:32] promised word of the hour and expect the
[58:35] promised word of the hour to be
[58:37] manifested in our lives or anybody
[58:39] else's
[58:45] lives praise the
[58:49] Lord sorry
[58:57] Matthew 17:10 and his disciples asked
[58:59] him saying why then say the scribes that
[59:01] Elias must first come and Jesus answered
[59:04] and said unto them Elias truly shall
[59:06] first come and restore all
[59:12] things in verse
[59:14] 11 there's two things in
[59:17] there I'm sorry two subjects in there
[59:21] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[59:23] Elias how many knows who the Elias
[59:30] was if you don't that's okay I'll tell
[59:33] you it was brother
[59:37] branam and Jesus answered and said unto
[59:39] them the ministry of brother
[59:42] brandham the seventh
[59:45] angel
[59:48] Elijah truly shall first
[59:53] come but there's an end there
[59:58] and restore all
[1:00:05] things so is the promised word of the
[1:00:08] hour Elias shall truly first
[1:00:12] come or is the promised word of the hour
[1:00:14] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[1:00:16] all
[1:00:17] things cuz it's easy to believe that
[1:00:20] Elias came it's easy to believe that He
[1:00:22] restored all things what's hard to
[1:00:25] believe is those things that He restored
[1:00:28] one of those things is not just a
[1:00:30] Doctrine but one of those things is
[1:00:35] me that's the promised word for the
[1:00:40] hour say I'd like some more backup for
[1:00:43] that I'm glad you ask Luke 1:34 then
[1:00:46] said Mary unto the angel how shall this
[1:00:48] be seeing that I know not a man and the
[1:00:51] angel answered and said unto her the
[1:00:52] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[1:00:54] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:00:55] thee therefore also that Holy
[1:01:01] thing that thing was a person I'll
[1:01:04] remind
[1:01:06] you what shall be born of thee shall be
[1:01:08] called The Son of
[1:01:12] God so did Elias Truly Come absolutely
[1:01:16] he did did he restore all things only
[1:01:19] you can answer
[1:01:23] that it's not going to change whether
[1:01:26] Elias came and restored all things to
[1:01:29] me or should I say restored
[1:01:32] me that that Revelation is not going to
[1:01:38] change but I hope it'll change in you if
[1:01:40] you don't see yourself there when it
[1:01:42] says that He restored all
[1:01:44] things and not just make that a
[1:01:46] doctrinal teaching I remember when I
[1:01:48] first caught this if I'm so way off my
[1:01:50] notes I might as well just tell you a
[1:01:52] story anyhow am I worked at Columbia
[1:01:55] Forest Products in Craigsville West
[1:01:57] Virginia I was probably 20 years
[1:01:59] old I'm working on the blank press
[1:02:03] operation midnight shift 600 to 6 don't
[1:02:07] recommend
[1:02:08] that I'm having a conversation with a
[1:02:10] man cuz he asked me what I
[1:02:12] believe and you know I'm 20 years old I
[1:02:15] got the World by the tail I got
[1:02:16] everything figured
[1:02:18] out I start laying scriptures on him
[1:02:22] just I mean we got two hours before we
[1:02:24] go to our next break so like he got it
[1:02:28] all Malachi 4 Revelation 10 right on
[1:02:32] down the list about the cloud about the
[1:02:35] coming about the seals being
[1:02:38] open I go through all of this I don't
[1:02:40] know how long it was but I'm going to
[1:02:41] say it was probably well over an hour
[1:02:45] I'm sure you all have trouble believing
[1:02:47] that you know what this man did when I
[1:02:50] got to the end of that and I told him
[1:02:51] that Christ had come in 1963 and there
[1:02:54] was a cloud to verify that and his pict
[1:02:55] picture was taken you know what he had
[1:02:57] the audacity to ask
[1:03:01] me that's really interesting where's he
[1:03:04] at
[1:03:10] now he didn't even not believe
[1:03:13] everything that I had just told him and
[1:03:15] about the cloud and
[1:03:17] everything okay that's neat that's
[1:03:20] interesting I'll go with
[1:03:22] that so he was in the cloud where's he
[1:03:25] at now
[1:03:29] it was the worst question Satan could
[1:03:32] allow him to
[1:03:35] ask you have those moments in your life
[1:03:38] you know they say everything goes into
[1:03:40] slow
[1:03:42] motion tunnel vision and all that I'll
[1:03:45] tell you what happened according to what
[1:03:47] brother Brandon said something fell out
[1:03:49] of a mystical channel for me something
[1:03:51] came tumbling down through a mystical
[1:03:54] Channel and this
[1:03:57] man asking me this
[1:04:00] question suddenly sparked a revelation
[1:04:03] in
[1:04:07] me and I
[1:04:10] caught I can show you where he's
[1:04:13] come and I can't show you where he
[1:04:18] left which
[1:04:20] means he has to be somewhere here yeah
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:26] now I'm not saying that I had a full
[1:04:29] spectrum of Revelation on the
[1:04:31] subject but it was the worst question
[1:04:34] Satan could allow that man to ask
[1:04:37] because I started 2 plus 2 equals 4 kind
[1:04:40] of
[1:04:42] thing and I quickly
[1:04:46] realized that up to that
[1:04:49] point I had been preaching to that man
[1:04:51] where Jesus
[1:04:53] was past tense
[1:04:56] not where he was present
[1:05:02] tense you know what happened when he
[1:05:04] asked me that and everything went into
[1:05:06] slow motion and I caught this Revelation
[1:05:09] like I don't know how long it took it
[1:05:11] couldn't have been but seconds but it
[1:05:13] seemed like an
[1:05:15] eternity I had the answer to his
[1:05:17] question he's in his
[1:05:24] people right I mean that's progress I
[1:05:27] still wasn't up to he's right
[1:05:29] here but I at least could acknowledge
[1:05:31] he's in his
[1:05:32] people there's been some growth take
[1:05:34] place there's been some word open up
[1:05:36] since then now if I'm ask that question
[1:05:38] I can just Clearly say he's right
[1:05:41] here you might not like that you might
[1:05:44] have trouble seeing that some days I do
[1:05:46] too but it doesn't change the
[1:05:48] Revelation it doesn't change the
[1:05:50] Revelation and the word for this hour
[1:05:52] that he is right
[1:05:54] here amen
[1:05:57] you know what happened after I told the
[1:05:58] man that he's in his people he didn't
[1:06:01] have any more
[1:06:04] questions that was the end of the
[1:06:09] conversation cuz there is no more
[1:06:14] questions after Jesus Christ is come in
[1:06:17] the
[1:06:18] flesh there may be some doctrinal
[1:06:22] misunderstandings there may be some more
[1:06:24] knowledge gained
[1:06:26] but the answer to the question as
[1:06:29] brother brandom says we have the answer
[1:06:31] to the
[1:06:39] question I'm just going to go a little
[1:06:41] bit further and we're going to close
[1:06:42] because there's no way that I'm going to
[1:06:44] make it through all of
[1:06:52] this Malachi 45 very familiar
[1:06:58] behold I who is the
[1:07:02] ey we all know this is God behold I God
[1:07:07] will
[1:07:08] send
[1:07:11] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[1:07:14] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:07:16] Lord great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:07:19] and He Elijah the
[1:07:21] prophet shall turn the hearts of the
[1:07:24] fathers to the children
[1:07:26] and the hearts of the children to their
[1:07:28] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:07:31] with a
[1:07:33] curse how many have a problem
[1:07:35] identifying brother brandham as the
[1:07:36] Elijah in
[1:07:38] that good it's easy to identify yep that
[1:07:41] applied to brother brandham right there
[1:07:43] Malachi
[1:07:44] 4:5 that's brother
[1:07:50] brandham who's the
[1:07:54] you amen
[1:07:56] and which is the promised word for the
[1:07:58] hour because the prophet's not here
[1:08:01] anymore does that mean we do away with
[1:08:04] the
[1:08:06] prophet but are we going past the
[1:08:09] prophet are we leaving the
[1:08:12] prophet leaving in a scriptural sense
[1:08:15] he's not here
[1:08:22] Saints but even that comment going past
[1:08:26] the prophet leaving the
[1:08:30] prophet you all can sense that
[1:08:33] too let's deal with
[1:08:36] that let's not sweep it under the rug
[1:08:39] why can't we comfortably say we've went
[1:08:41] past the prophet not that we've left the
[1:08:44] prophet but we have went past the
[1:08:47] prophet I assure you if he was here and
[1:08:50] we were still preaching just the prophet
[1:08:53] he would have a problem with us
[1:08:57] he gave his life not on a cross but he
[1:09:00] gave his life for that Ministry he
[1:09:02] surrendered to that
[1:09:04] Ministry why so that we could go past
[1:09:08] the Revelation that God sent a prophet
[1:09:10] and come to a revelation of who this you
[1:09:13] is in ch in verse
[1:09:16] five it would be an insult to his
[1:09:20] ministry if we would skip that and just
[1:09:23] say behold I will send Elijah the
[1:09:26] Prophet no the scripture says behold I
[1:09:28] will send
[1:09:29] you Elijah the prophet which is more
[1:09:34] important the you or the Elijah if he's
[1:09:37] sending the Elijah for
[1:09:47] you and who are these children in verse
[1:09:52] six right
[1:09:55] who are these
[1:10:05] children Joel 2:23 be glad then ye
[1:10:08] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[1:10:09] your God for he hath given you the
[1:10:11] former rain moderately and he will come
[1:10:13] he will cause to come down for you the
[1:10:15] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[1:10:16] in the first month and the floor shall
[1:10:18] be full of Wheat and the fats shall
[1:10:19] overflow with wine and
[1:10:22] oil and I will restore to you the years
[1:10:26] that the Locust hath eaten the
[1:10:28] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[1:10:29] Palmer worm many the great Army which I
[1:10:32] sent unto you and ye shall eat in plenty
[1:10:35] and be satisfi satisfied and praise the
[1:10:36] name of the Lord for your of your God
[1:10:39] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[1:10:41] my people shall never be ashamed and ye
[1:10:43] shall know that I am in the midst of
[1:10:45] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[1:10:47] and none else and my people shall never
[1:10:49] be
[1:10:50] ashamed who's the children of Zion
[1:10:55] how many believes that the Lord will
[1:10:57] restore how many believe the Lord hath
[1:11:02] restored who are these children of Zion
[1:11:05] though it's easy to say yeah he'll
[1:11:08] restore he'll fix things he'll build
[1:11:11] back the bride tree but who's the bride
[1:11:14] tree am amen who's the children of
[1:11:19] Zion I will restore to you who is this
[1:11:23] you here
[1:11:27] it says my people shall never be
[1:11:30] ashamed if you run that back we won't
[1:11:32] take time through but you'll link
[1:11:35] ashamed is most of the time linked to
[1:11:39] nakedness my children my people will not
[1:11:42] be naked and my people will not be
[1:11:48] naked why won't we be naked why won't we
[1:11:52] be ashamed because he's restored
[1:11:55] restored
[1:11:57] what what are we clothed
[1:11:59] with the promised word for the
[1:12:08] hour I wonder if we so easily read over
[1:12:13] the most important parts of the
[1:12:18] scripture which is more important a
[1:12:20] revelation about somebody else's
[1:12:22] position in the scripture or a
[1:12:24] revelation about your position in the
[1:12:26] scripture
[1:12:30] right you say Well they're both
[1:12:32] important you're right it's just one's
[1:12:35] more important to
[1:12:38] you and one's more important to the
[1:12:40] other
[1:12:42] person Eliah Elijah's
[1:12:50] Revelation you know brother brandom
[1:12:52] didn't come out of the womb knowing he
[1:12:55] was Malachi
[1:12:57] 45 there was a revelation that had to
[1:13:00] take
[1:13:02] place and one day he had to come to
[1:13:05] terms with the
[1:13:06] fact that that Elijah in Malachi
[1:13:10] 4:5 was him yeah
[1:13:18] right one of these days we're going to
[1:13:21] have to come to terms with the
[1:13:23] fact that that Elijah
[1:13:25] that was sent in Malachi 4:5 was to
[1:13:34] me brother let me ask you this and maybe
[1:13:38] this will ease some tension did Brother
[1:13:40] Brandon's Revelation that he was Elijah
[1:13:44] in Malachi
[1:13:46] 4:5 detract from your Revelation that
[1:13:49] you're the children in Malachi
[1:13:52] 4:5 like do you have a problem with him
[1:13:54] saying
[1:13:56] this part's me and this is more
[1:13:57] important to
[1:14:01] me no that's him yeah how could we be
[1:14:04] upset that that's more important to him
[1:14:07] he's identified himself in the
[1:14:10] scripture do you think brother Brandon
[1:14:12] would come along and be like I would
[1:14:14] much rather you see that I'm in that
[1:14:16] scripture than you are in that
[1:14:19] scripture how silly this is but why is
[1:14:22] it so uncomfortable when it comes up in
[1:14:24] conversation
[1:14:31] I say we don't let it be uncomfortable
[1:14:33] anymore I say we know where we stand we
[1:14:36] preach the pure word of God for the
[1:14:39] hour and we let the chips fall where
[1:14:41] they may not in a not in a nasty way not
[1:14:45] in an offending way if anything do it as
[1:14:49] most unoffending as you can as Paul says
[1:14:52] so that I might win one to Christ amen
[1:14:54] amen so take the soft approach
[1:14:57] first you know the they say in the
[1:15:01] business world the best leaders and the
[1:15:05] most powerful people is the ones who
[1:15:07] have a great idea and then convince you
[1:15:10] it was your
[1:15:15] idea I wonder if we preach the gospel
[1:15:18] that way if we wouldn't get better
[1:15:21] results I wonder if I preach the gospel
[1:15:24] that way if I wouldn't get better
[1:15:26] results maybe have a revelation and lay
[1:15:30] it
[1:15:31] out instead of running it down
[1:15:33] somebody's
[1:15:35] throat to where they pick it up and see
[1:15:39] what I wanted them to see and come
[1:15:42] preach it to me like I don't see
[1:15:45] it and then have the humility to be like
[1:15:48] that's wonderful and not tell them that
[1:15:50] I already knew
[1:15:53] that I want wonder if that approach
[1:15:55] wouldn't work a little bit
[1:16:00] better as the musicians come
[1:16:04] please Luke 17 we're very familiar with
[1:16:07] this and when it was demanded of the
[1:16:09] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[1:16:11] come he answered them and said the
[1:16:12] kingdom of God cometh not with
[1:16:14] observation neither shall they say Lo
[1:16:16] here or low there for behold the kingdom
[1:16:18] of God is within you and he saith unto
[1:16:20] the disciples the days will come when
[1:16:22] you shall desire to see one of the days
[1:16:25] of the son of man and you shall not see
[1:16:28] it and they shall say unto you see here
[1:16:31] or see there go not after them nor
[1:16:33] follow them for as the lightning that
[1:16:35] lith out of one part under Heaven
[1:16:37] shineth into the other part under heaven
[1:16:39] so shall also the son of man be in his
[1:16:42] day don't get hung up on this
[1:16:43] terminology I don't have time to teach
[1:16:45] you here tonight when you see son of man
[1:16:47] that is Christ in his fullness in
[1:16:50] flesh verse 30 we're very familiar with
[1:16:53] this even th so now he's prophesying
[1:16:56] he's moving from present tense to future
[1:16:59] tense even thus shall it be in the day
[1:17:01] when the son of man is
[1:17:04] revealed how many have heard this
[1:17:06] scripture
[1:17:10] before even thus shall it be in the days
[1:17:14] when the son of man is revealed how many
[1:17:17] have no trouble believing that we live
[1:17:21] and have lived in the days of the son of
[1:17:23] man
[1:17:28] but there's another word in there
[1:17:32] revealed the son of man in the day when
[1:17:37] the son of man is
[1:17:42] revealed does the son of man need to
[1:17:45] reveal himself to
[1:17:48] himself
[1:17:50] on that means this
[1:17:52] Revelation incorporates
[1:17:55] another another
[1:17:58] people how many times have we been
[1:18:01] guilty of reading Luke 17:30 and saying
[1:18:03] that's brother brandom's
[1:18:05] Ministry and forgetting the people
[1:18:07] that's under that word revealed right
[1:18:12] there which is the present word for the
[1:18:15] day what is the present word for the
[1:18:18] hour what will bring the seeds that are
[1:18:21] laying here that need to come to a new
[1:18:23] birth to life
[1:18:25] telling them that God sent a prophet
[1:18:27] telling them that we lived in the days
[1:18:28] of the son of
[1:18:30] man or telling them that the son of man
[1:18:32] is
[1:18:34] revealed in your flesh and in my
[1:18:40] flesh you say my 8-year-old can't handle
[1:18:44] that I say try
[1:18:48] it I say try
[1:18:53] it they made just be so naive and un
[1:18:57] indoctrinated that they might just
[1:18:58] believe it the first time you tell
[1:19:03] them because the seed is predestinated
[1:19:07] for the word of the
[1:19:23] hour the seed can't help
[1:19:29] itself I'll tell you one Surefire way
[1:19:33] not to let that 8-year-old know who he
[1:19:36] or she is is not tell them that Jesus
[1:19:39] Christ is coming the Flesh and that
[1:19:41] we're still living in the days of the
[1:19:43] son of man and this revealed right here
[1:19:46] in verse 30 that
[1:19:49] revealed speaks of me because he has
[1:19:52] revealed the son of man has revealed
[1:19:55] himself to me there's two people in that
[1:19:59] sentence not just
[1:20:02] one verse 37 and they answered and said
[1:20:05] unto him where Lord and he said unto
[1:20:07] them wheresoever the body is tither will
[1:20:11] the E Eagles be gathered
[1:20:17] together who's the
[1:20:19] body wheresoever the body is the body
[1:20:23] the body word of the son of man wherever
[1:20:26] that
[1:20:29] is there's going to be some Eagles
[1:20:33] there how many times have we read Luke
[1:20:36] 17 and checked the Box beside brother
[1:20:39] brandham and we forgot who it was
[1:20:41] revealed to and who these Eagles
[1:20:45] were and
[1:20:48] bypassed the present word for the
[1:20:51] hour brother Brant I'm not just making
[1:20:54] these things up Saints brother brandom
[1:20:55] says in what in the attraction what is
[1:20:57] the attraction on the mountain he says
[1:20:59] these things that we talked about years
[1:21:01] ago speaking sir what time it is is it
[1:21:04] and and the seals and the Thunders he
[1:21:06] says these things that we spoke about a
[1:21:08] few years ago are now
[1:21:15] history if those things are now history
[1:21:19] how can those things be the present word
[1:21:21] for the
[1:21:23] hour not not that they do not are not
[1:21:27] incorporated into the present word for
[1:21:29] the
[1:21:32] hour does that make sense are we
[1:21:35] comfortable with
[1:21:36] that are we comfortable saying that the
[1:21:39] seventh angel is
[1:21:40] history he said it his ministry his
[1:21:44] regular Commission in what is the
[1:21:47] attraction on the mountain he said Is
[1:21:48] Now
[1:21:52] history so what's the presid word for
[1:21:55] the hour the purpose the people for
[1:21:58] which it came to and which it came
[1:22:01] for and what will bring a new birth in
[1:22:06] this
[1:22:07] hour telling them that the seals were
[1:22:12] preached that the son of man did
[1:22:16] come that God did send a
[1:22:20] prophet
[1:22:21] absolutely we got to lay a foundation
[1:22:25] but what's going to make that seed
[1:22:27] that's predestinated for this hour come
[1:22:29] to
[1:22:32] life Jesus Christ is coming the Flesh
[1:22:36] and this is how he came this is the
[1:22:38] channel that he used these are the tools
[1:22:41] that he used but the purpose for the
[1:22:44] penalty being paid the purpose for the
[1:22:47] Resurrection the purpose for the holy
[1:22:49] spirit being sent back the purpose for
[1:22:52] Luther coming and preaching
[1:22:53] justification the purpose purpose for
[1:22:55] Wesley catching light and preaching
[1:22:57] sanctification the purpose for the
[1:22:59] restoration of the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:02] Spirit the purpose of
[1:23:07] that is so that we could come to
[1:23:11] Perfection that we could be Jesus Christ
[1:23:15] is come in the
[1:23:17] flesh if we preach everything except for
[1:23:20] the purpose what are we preaching if we
[1:23:23] preach everything and miss the purpose
[1:23:26] and miss the people of that
[1:23:29] purpose what have we
[1:23:32] gained if we preach everything but Don't
[1:23:35] Preach Jesus Christ is come in the
[1:23:38] flesh how do we expect new births for a
[1:23:42] predestinated seed sitting amongst us
[1:23:45] who is only
[1:23:47] predestinated for the word Jesus Christ
[1:23:49] is come in the flesh let's Stand
[1:23:53] Together if we want
[1:23:58] something we have to speak the word for
[1:24:03] that
[1:24:04] something the appropriate word for that
[1:24:11] something I'm just going to stop because
[1:24:14] if I don't I'll keep
[1:24:17] going and then we'll be here way
[1:24:20] late I apologize if it was a bit quiet
[1:24:26] and maybe
[1:24:27] sobering and maybe
[1:24:31] rough I assure you what I had in mind
[1:24:34] was not what I just
[1:24:38] did but that's what's on my heart
[1:24:42] Saints I don't mean it to be offensive I
[1:24:44] don't mean it
[1:24:47] to I don't mean it to be any other way
[1:24:49] than just a help and I hope that you can
[1:24:52] see through the
[1:24:54] rough parts and
[1:24:57] the parts that
[1:24:59] aren't maybe kosher and just see my
[1:25:02] heart
[1:25:05] that there's people that need a new
[1:25:08] birth and it's not just enough to tell
[1:25:11] them they need a new
[1:25:13] birth there's people that need a new
[1:25:17] birth and they need the word for the
[1:25:22] hour preached to them
[1:25:25] not the word for a past
[1:25:29] hour we need the word for the past hour
[1:25:32] in the present hour we need it all
[1:25:36] because that's the position we've been
[1:25:38] called to we can't preach a
[1:25:42] gospel like any other ages preach the
[1:25:45] gospel because there's no other age been
[1:25:48] in the position we've been
[1:25:50] in with the full word restored amen amen
[1:25:55] we would never detract from the ages of
[1:25:59] partiality it would be silly for us to
[1:26:02] do that because we understand now why
[1:26:04] they preached the way they preached and
[1:26:06] what they preached but they preached
[1:26:07] everything in the fullness that they
[1:26:09] could but now that we've come to an age
[1:26:12] of fullness how silly it would
[1:26:16] be to say that partiality will be
[1:26:20] okay we have to preach the fullness and
[1:26:24] the fullness is not going to be accepted
[1:26:27] and liked by those who just want
[1:26:30] partiality and by like I said I'm not
[1:26:32] I'm not speaking people I'm speaking
[1:26:35] Spirits so this is not an attack against
[1:26:38] anybody or any minister or church or
[1:26:41] anything this is just an attack on that
[1:26:46] spirit because remember what the
[1:26:49] deception is for this
[1:26:52] age to make the people believe they're
[1:26:56] okay when they're
[1:26:59] not and that doesn't mean that we have
[1:27:01] to live in fear and that we have to live
[1:27:04] in uncertainty cuz we have the answer
[1:27:08] amen we can believe we're okay and be
[1:27:13] okay amen just because you believe
[1:27:16] you're okay doesn't mean you're
[1:27:21] deceived that is the deception though
[1:27:24] yeah for anybody trying to get to the
[1:27:27] new birth to trying to have a new birth
[1:27:30] to trying to come to the word for their
[1:27:32] hour is Satan is going to try to make
[1:27:35] you think you've arrived that you're
[1:27:37] okay when you're not the only thing that
[1:27:39] I know to do to combat that is
[1:27:41] continually tell you what the correct
[1:27:44] word for the hour is not the word for
[1:27:47] another age with the word for this age
[1:27:49] let's pray together Lord
[1:27:52] Jesus father I
[1:27:54] pray that you would come here this
[1:27:56] evening Lord
[1:27:58] and just do something Supernatural
[1:28:02] father and take the words that I've
[1:28:04] spoken and
[1:28:07] somehow let the people see what you
[1:28:10] placed in my heart to deliver
[1:28:14] Lord father
[1:28:16] it's obviously been completely different
[1:28:19] of how I thought it would transpire Lord
[1:28:22] but I just commit myself to you Lord and
[1:28:26] I just
[1:28:29] pray that you would accomplish here in
[1:28:32] spite of me Lord that you would
[1:28:34] accomplish
[1:28:35] here what you needed to accomplish Lord
[1:28:39] and I pray that
[1:28:40] you have come and spoken to
[1:28:45] hearts that need to be born again under
[1:28:49] the word for this hour and revealed to
[1:28:52] them Lord
[1:28:54] what that word
[1:28:57] is and that it is
[1:29:00] attainable and not only is it
[1:29:02] attainable but if were your children
[1:29:05] were predestinated to
[1:29:08] it Lord may you just continue to reveal
[1:29:11] yourself to
[1:29:13] us may you bring a birth to those that
[1:29:16] need a birth and may you bring growth to
[1:29:19] those that need growth because I believe
[1:29:22] we can all say with an honest heart we
[1:29:24] fall in one of those two
[1:29:26] categories I pray that you would have
[1:29:28] accomplished both here tonight Lord we
[1:29:31] just Commit This service to you for your
[1:29:34] glory and for your purpose in Jesus
[1:29:37] Christ's name the bride says amen God
[1:29:41] bless you Saints let's sing a song
[1:29:43] brother give me
[1:29:47] more
[1:29:50] Revelation let my flesh be all
[1:29:58] forsaken that the
[1:30:00] word of God guide me
[1:30:04] on my
[1:30:06] way so he can have
[1:30:10] prence each
[1:30:13] day give me
[1:30:21] more Let My Life
[1:30:24] be
[1:30:25] your
[1:30:28] reflection for I
[1:30:31] know this word is my
[1:30:36] Redemption give me
[1:30:40] more
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:44] reel man I was thinking as brother Ben
[1:30:47] was preaching there at the end that you
[1:30:50] remember brother B's story of the eagle
[1:30:52] in the chicken yard
[1:30:55] the eagle in the chicken yard had
[1:30:57] already heard denominational
[1:31:01] clucking but it didn't wake him up to
[1:31:03] who he really
[1:31:05] was it heard a lot of clucking and heard
[1:31:07] a lot of noise and heard a lot of bird
[1:31:10] sounds he was in the bird family and he
[1:31:12] was around
[1:31:13] Birds but one day an eagle
[1:31:17] screamed and the eagle scream reflected
[1:31:20] something that was inside of him and
[1:31:22] only the eagle scream could wake him up
[1:31:25] to who he really was am that's what the
[1:31:28] true revelation of this message is it's
[1:31:30] the eagle scream to
[1:31:33] Eagles a lot of clucking a lot of noise
[1:31:35] a lot of things we've heard but only an
[1:31:37] eagle scream will bring an eagle to a
[1:31:40] revelation of who it is I thank God for
[1:31:43] a
[1:31:44] message that screamed like an
[1:31:47] eagle and something inside it wasn't
[1:31:50] something that was taught but there was
[1:31:51] an automatic reaction yes that that
[1:31:55] sounds right am to me amen I was also
[1:32:00] thinking when I just had this thought
[1:32:02] there in my seat do you remember brother
[1:32:04] M tells the story about the Welsh
[1:32:06] Revival it was an amazing Revival that
[1:32:08] broke
[1:32:09] out in in the area uh uh and it was the
[1:32:13] Welsh Revival there in England and some
[1:32:15] people a delegation from America wanted
[1:32:17] to come and learn about the Welsh
[1:32:19] Revival they might have wanted to know
[1:32:20] where it was taking place and what
[1:32:22] doctrines they were teaching and how
[1:32:23] they structured themselves so they were
[1:32:25] sent over to learn about the W Revival
[1:32:27] and they were looking for where the
[1:32:28] Revival was taking place and you all
[1:32:30] know the story they came in contact with
[1:32:32] a little police officer there whistling
[1:32:35] a song and Swinging his baton and they
[1:32:37] asked him good man could you tell us
[1:32:39] where the W Revival is he said certainly
[1:32:41] he said I am the Welsh
[1:32:43] Revival I think he had a revelation of
[1:32:46] what the Welsh Revival was all about
[1:32:48] right it was an Awakening to him it was
[1:32:50] a life that came to him amen can we say
[1:32:53] the same thing about the message if
[1:32:54] somebody says can you show me where the
[1:32:55] message is what is the message listen
[1:32:58] the message is that God was restoring
[1:33:00] his people back to that right
[1:33:02] relationship back to Sons and Daughters
[1:33:04] of God so that he can manifest himself
[1:33:07] completely in his people again on the
[1:33:09] earth so where is the
[1:33:12] message it's not in a building and it's
[1:33:15] not in a book am the message is in a
[1:33:19] people it is a people amen it's coming
[1:33:22] to perfection
[1:33:25] that's the Revelation that that little
[1:33:29] policeman he caught the revelation of
[1:33:31] the weal Revival not over here
[1:33:34] something's happening and these were the
[1:33:35] signs and these were the things that
[1:33:37] happen and this was the newspaper report
[1:33:39] on it and this is what was taught that
[1:33:40] that he caught what the Welsh Revival
[1:33:43] was he was the Welsh
[1:33:45] Revival God helped me to catch what this
[1:33:48] message is help us all to catch what
[1:33:51] this message is and may God help
[1:33:55] us in all that we say and all that we do
[1:33:59] may it be a true Eagle scream whenever
[1:34:01] we talk to somebody cuz that's the only
[1:34:03] thing that'll wake up an eagle to what
[1:34:06] it
[1:34:07] is amen God bless you how many's heard
[1:34:10] an eagle scream amen and it resounded
[1:34:13] inside remember brother R tells the
[1:34:15] story the little boy goes to his aunt's
[1:34:17] house and never seen a mirror before and
[1:34:19] all of a sudden he goes up the steps and
[1:34:21] he sees a mirror and he moves in the
[1:34:23] little boy moves and all of a sudden he
[1:34:26] understands that that's me brother B
[1:34:29] does the same thing with this Bible when
[1:34:30] the words revealed all of the sudden you
[1:34:32] see that that movement there and that
[1:34:35] character there and the way brother that
[1:34:38] what brother B's talking about that's me
[1:34:40] amen that word that he's talking about

[1:34:44] somebody else it's not other people it's
[1:34:46] me Mama it's me oh God give us that
[1:34:51] Revelation that this message it's about
[1:34:55] me because that's the true Revelation
[1:34:58] that'll carry us let's bow our heads
[1:35:00] together and thank the Lord for his word
[1:35:03] Lord Jesus we thank you for this word
[1:35:06] God I pray that you would help us Lord
[1:35:07] to stay true to this message you've
[1:35:09] given us and may our Revelation grow to
[1:35:13] where we' even understand what it is we
[1:35:15] hold within us that it become more alive
[1:35:18] and more real and that we'd be able to
[1:35:21] share it in its fullness Lord that we
[1:35:23] would be able ourselves to move Beyond a
[1:35:26] partial realization but even in our own
[1:35:28] Revelation that you would open our eyes
[1:35:31] to see the reality all around us and may
[1:35:34] that reality Lord be on display and may
[1:35:37] it be you not
[1:35:38] us God and may God May the revelation of
[1:35:42] that strike others
