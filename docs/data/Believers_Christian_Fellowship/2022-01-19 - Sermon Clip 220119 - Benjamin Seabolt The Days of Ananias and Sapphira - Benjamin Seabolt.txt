========================================

when i say the days of ananias and sapphira the point is not for dead people because if you recall we had these days in brother branham's ministry with brother way brother brandon says he was preaching he exposed that complex in his life and he said he resented me exposing that and he died of a heart attack repeat of scripture a shock hit him so bad he physically had a heart attack and died i'll just remind you that the prophet of god did not leave him laying there dead and i want to put it this way if the power of god would fall in this assembly and do what it did in the days of ananias and sapphira i don't want to be the one standing on the side saying i deserve them right i want to be the one laying there praying for them calling out for mercy calling for their life to come back if there's any way because i'm not above that i'm in hybrid flesh just like you are i'm human just like you are and that's the spirit and the objective that i want to operate with and it's the same way now we we recognize that in a mighty physical demonstration and a very specific demonstration but the same thing happens each and every service and each and every time we come in contact with the word when the word exposes something to us you may not fall physically dead but you can walk out of those church doors dead as a door now because you have rejected the word i don't want that to be the case either if the word of god is coming and i'm not getting it i want somebody to intercede for me and to cry out for me god help him to see it god help him to get it because we all know it's just a it's just a common understanding it is ten times easier for me to see something wrong in your life than it is to see it in my life and it's ten times easier for you to see something wrong in my life than it is in your own that's why iron sharpeneth iron and the purpose of sharpening iron is not to kill your brother or your sister the point is to be able to cut that thing away from your brother and sister without hurting them with the right motive with the right objective to allow the power and demonstration and purity and realness of the days of ananias and sapphira to return into the church with the right motive and with the right objective not for death not for death physical or spiritual not for suffering but so that that person can be free so that they can walk in a pureness of heart truly giving all things
