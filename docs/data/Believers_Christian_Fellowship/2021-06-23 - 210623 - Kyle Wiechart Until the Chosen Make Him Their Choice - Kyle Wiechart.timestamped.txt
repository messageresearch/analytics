[7:43] a little bit even to give brother chad
[7:45] a little break some rest and always an
[7:48] honor to be able to just come and talk
[7:49] about the lord a little bit here so
[7:52] no matter how little it is if it's him
[7:54] we're satisfied
[7:56] and it always serves this purpose like
[7:57] bread upon the water he said it won't
[7:59] return into a
[8:00] void it always serves its purpose so i
[8:03] sure
[8:03] appreciate you all coming out tonight
[8:05] and we'll just have some fun
[8:07] fellowshipping around him um
[8:09] [Music]
[8:10] i have a little testimony before we
[8:12] start is that okay a lot of change
[8:14] my daughter today she had uh had a
[8:18] friend over and that friend
[8:19] lost her keys and she was uh kind of
[8:22] running around the house for about an
[8:23] hour
[8:24] and they couldn't find it and so callie
[8:27] came in
[8:27] and she's kind of running around i says
[8:29] have you prayed and she said yeah i
[8:31] prayed twice
[8:32] and i said but did you believe and she
[8:35] said
[8:36] yes i believe i said well then just
[8:37] trust the lord keep on walking
[8:39] and keep looking you'll find it she said
[8:41] okay she walked out the door she said
[8:43] don't worry everybody we're going to
[8:44] find it
[8:45] and they found it instantly i said well
[8:48] praise the lord
[8:50] you know i'm glad when they
[8:54] when she came back she's like dad you're
[8:55] not gonna believe it i'm like i do
[8:57] believe it
[8:58] i do believe it right callie i believe
[9:01] it
[9:02] so sometimes you just have to believe
[9:04] after you pray that god's going to do
[9:06] what you've asked him to do because we
[9:09] you ask sometimes a myth because you
[9:10] don't believe when you ask that's the
[9:12] problem
[9:13] he's i believe he's just waiting to show
[9:16] himself strong on our behalf
[9:18] i really believe that i think he looks
[9:20] for those opportunities where they're
[9:21] back doing the corner and just say oh
[9:23] just call me on the scene
[9:24] i'm ready to go and i appreciate that
[9:27] that he did that for cali
[9:28] and uh so i thought you might be blessed
[9:31] in that
[9:33] um we'll just go right to the word
[9:35] that's okay a little bit more in my
[9:36] comfort zone
[9:38] um just turn to hebrews chapter 3
[9:42] verse 16. hebrews chapter 3 verse 16.
[9:48] don't exactly know um the
[9:51] the entire direction of this it's one of
[9:53] those things that's you kind of been
[9:55] i've been just meditating on the lord
[9:56] and different things have been
[9:58] jumping out to me and you just kind of
[10:00] grab them all and you
[10:01] you just carry them out here and just
[10:03] kind of curious what the lord will do
[10:05] with it
[10:06] so it's interesting you you walk by
[10:08] faith and not by sight
[10:10] and i just believe that god has a
[10:11] purpose and little inspirations and
[10:13] little feelings
[10:14] and god always makes it work out right
[10:18] hebrews 11 hebrews 3 16
[10:23] for some when they had heard did provoke
[10:26] howbeit not all that came out of egypt
[10:29] by moses
[10:30] but with whom was he grieved forty years
[10:34] was it not with them that had sinned
[10:36] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[10:38] and to whom swear he that they should
[10:40] not enter into his rest
[10:42] but to them that believed not so we see
[10:46] that they could not enter in because of
[10:49] unbelief
[10:50] let us therefore fear lest a promise
[10:54] being
[10:54] left us of entering into his rest
[10:58] any of you should seem to come short of
[11:01] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[11:04] well as
[11:05] unto them but the word preached
[11:08] did not profit them not being mixed with
[11:12] faith in them that heard it for we which
[11:15] have believed
[11:16] do enter into rest as he said
[11:19] as i have sworn in my wrath if they
[11:23] shall
[11:23] enter into my rest although the works
[11:26] were finished from
[11:28] from the foundation of the world
[11:32] next scripture please joshua chapters
[11:40] 24.
[11:46] joshua 24 13
[11:50] says and i have given you a land for
[11:52] which you did not labor
[11:54] cities that you did not build are built
[11:56] not and ye dwell in them
[11:59] of the vineyards and of the olive yards
[12:00] which he planted
[12:02] not planted not do ye eat
[12:05] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[12:07] him in sincerity and truth and put away
[12:10] the gods
[12:11] which your father served on the other
[12:12] side of the flood
[12:14] and in egypt and serve ye the lord for
[12:17] if it seems
[12:17] evil unto you to serve the lord choose
[12:20] you this day
[12:21] whom you will serve whether the gods
[12:24] which your father
[12:25] served that were on the other side of
[12:27] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[12:29] whose land he dwell
[12:31] but as for me in my house we will serve
[12:34] the lord
[12:35] will you add will you bow your heads
[12:38] heavenly father lord we just come before
[12:40] you thankful lord
[12:41] with grateful hearts do we come lord
[12:44] knowing that you called us lord you
[12:46] elected us and you brought us together
[12:47] as a people
[12:49] father i believe that you've ordained
[12:50] this night i believe you've ordained
[12:52] everybody that's sitting and the one
[12:54] that's speaking
[12:55] father i just trust and believe lord
[12:58] that you're going to speak through me
[13:00] and the other counterpart the attribute
[13:02] that you've placed in the bride will
[13:03] hear
[13:04] and believe in those that are sitting
[13:06] before me
[13:07] father i just pray that lord you would
[13:09] come down
[13:10] may your holy spirit have free course
[13:12] lord search our lives search our hearts
[13:14] search our minds lord if there be
[13:16] anything
[13:17] wicked if there be anything that we are
[13:19] carrying with us that cannot continue
[13:21] i pray lord that you would search it out
[13:23] root it out
[13:24] lord take it away from us we don't want
[13:27] to be in your presence with something
[13:28] that is not right
[13:30] lord we want your will we want your ways
[13:32] we want
[13:33] we want to die a greater death to
[13:35] ourselves so that you can have a greater
[13:37] expression in us father
[13:39] so lord i commit this evening all the
[13:41] words into your hands
[13:43] shut my mind to anything that would be
[13:45] contrary lord let me just say what you
[13:47] once said
[13:48] lord we love you and thank you in jesus
[13:51] name
[13:51] amen amen you may be seated
[13:57] i will say i am a is a little bit of a
[13:59] privilege for me this first time i've
[14:01] spoken you don't have masks
[14:03] so i'm very happy it's a strange thing
[14:06] it's the little things in life at this
[14:08] point that make you a little bit happy
[14:10] i get to look out and see all smiles no
[14:12] frowns
[14:13] all smiles we are we are happy people
[14:16] um so it it it's good good to see you
[14:20] guys
[14:20] well your face um
[14:24] i did want to say too i was thinking
[14:25] about brother nathaniel being here i
[14:26] really appreciated the service
[14:28] i think we all were blessed by that and
[14:30] i was just kind of
[14:31] contemplating some of those things that
[14:33] he was saying and i was i was thinking
[14:34] about you know brother banham tells a
[14:36] little story about a violin
[14:38] and that violin was an instrument that
[14:39] was put maybe in a corner couldn't be
[14:42] used for very good of anything but
[14:44] see it was uh he said but in the hands
[14:46] of the master
[14:47] oh my he could play quite a tune and and
[14:50] i got to think you know we're all
[14:51] instruments
[14:52] and in our lives we we may not be able
[14:55] to do very much with it
[14:56] our lives uh can't bring
[14:59] can't play much of a tune let's say with
[15:01] the life that maybe we
[15:03] may we do or what we do with our life
[15:05] but if we'll surrender to the hand of
[15:06] the master
[15:07] he can do things with it we never
[15:09] thought possible because he speaks of
[15:11] the old bible and
[15:12] what are the believers the words on the
[15:13] book and so
[15:15] just because submitting what we got in
[15:17] the little way that we got it into the
[15:19] hands of the master
[15:20] i'm convinced he can play quite a tune
[15:22] and i was so blessed by it and i just
[15:25] was really encouraged by brother
[15:26] nathaniel i
[15:28] have a title tonight and i'm kind of
[15:30] going all around to get there
[15:33] i have a title i'd just like to speak on
[15:35] for a little bit until the chosen make
[15:37] him their choice
[15:39] until the chosen make them him
[15:43] their choice and
[15:46] a little this inspiration for me is
[15:48] coming from some thoughts that i've had
[15:49] here lately in regards to
[15:53] none of us would doubt that we are the
[15:55] chosen of god you believe you're the
[15:57] chosen of god
[15:58] you believe god worked diligently and to
[16:00] seek you out
[16:02] to call you to elect you to bring you
[16:05] out of
[16:05] egypt to bring you out of bondage to
[16:07] bring you out of denominational ideas
[16:09] and traditions of man
[16:11] you would all none of you doubt that and
[16:14] we would rejoice in that we would
[16:16] rejoice in the fact that god had paid a
[16:17] great price and he
[16:18] he he went and had a great victory in
[16:21] redeeming
[16:22] us and bringing us into himself and
[16:24] sometimes i can
[16:26] i can i can i don't know how to say this
[16:28] exactly but
[16:29] sometimes i think we can get too
[16:31] comfortable in just the fact that we're
[16:33] rejoicing in the fact that we've been
[16:34] chosen but do you realize you've been
[16:36] chosen to make a choice
[16:39] like it sounds like strange things but
[16:41] it's actually the truth
[16:43] you've been chosen you know israel was
[16:44] an elect people of god they were god's
[16:46] chosen people
[16:47] god had sent them a prophet god ordained
[16:50] that man and used that man and
[16:51] vindicated his ministry so perfectly
[16:53] that no one could deny that this was the
[16:55] man that god was using to deliver us out
[16:57] of the
[16:57] out of the bondage of egypt but that
[16:59] purpose was to bring them out
[17:01] not to just bring them out and say
[17:02] praise god we are the chosen people
[17:05] but along a wilderness journey he was
[17:06] going to test them try them and see what
[17:09] choice
[17:09] they would excuse me make along the
[17:13] journey to see if they would be worthy
[17:15] to enter into
[17:16] the rest the promised lands of god right
[17:19] and so we find sometimes that just
[17:22] because we're rejoicing the fact that we
[17:24] are chosen that's good
[17:25] i do too but i believe it was more than
[17:28] that
[17:29] i believe that we see we can see this in
[17:31] israel
[17:32] we can see it with elijah we can see it
[17:34] in the life of esther
[17:36] we can see that they there is a chosen
[17:38] group of people
[17:39] that along the wilderness journey and in
[17:42] their time of testing
[17:44] they've got to make a choice i've got to
[17:46] make mine
[17:47] you've got to make yours we all have to
[17:49] make a certain choice
[17:51] because i find it interesting in the
[17:52] bible here he said in genesis 3 let us
[17:55] make man in our own image
[17:56] in the image of god in image of god
[17:58] created man
[18:00] male and female right male and female
[18:03] what is male and female male is seed
[18:05] giver
[18:06] female seed receiver so god when he
[18:09] created man he made us both male and
[18:11] female and he separated that feminist
[18:13] portion and put it in another body
[18:15] so there's another body on this earth
[18:16] that's to be the receiver of the seed
[18:19] and i'm saying that in the sense that
[18:21] now you have to realize what brother
[18:22] branham said about god he said god
[18:24] believed his own
[18:26] word and created the world
[18:29] sometimes we get to think well god just
[18:30] spoke god didn't just speak he believed
[18:33] what he spoke
[18:34] and it was the receiving of the seed
[18:36] that could bring into manifestation
[18:38] everything that you see you see how
[18:40] vitally important the bride is
[18:42] do you see the veil changing from male
[18:45] to female
[18:46] it's just the veil it's just god and
[18:48] more fade it's god
[18:49] bringing himself into reality but it's
[18:52] just as much
[18:53] the pure word of god needed in this day
[18:55] and age as there was someone on the
[18:57] scene that could actually receive it
[18:58] believe it and act on it it's both sides
[19:01] of the story
[19:02] we would none of us deny that we have a
[19:04] perfect interpretation of the word of
[19:06] god with divine vindication
[19:08] but where is the people that actually
[19:10] believe that perfect word of god with
[19:11] divine
[19:13] vindication that can bring it into a
[19:15] manifested state
[19:16] upon this earth as living epistles so
[19:19] many times we can sit here and say
[19:21] praise god i know i'm a chosen
[19:23] okay praise god that you know you're a
[19:25] part of the chosen but can you say
[19:27] praise god i'm choosing him
[19:29] while he chose me the only way you can
[19:31] choose him is you humble yourself
[19:33] you take his yoke upon you my burden is
[19:36] light
[19:37] but that means you take his word each
[19:39] and every day and apply it
[19:42] and this is my thought and i have a
[19:43] weird way i have strange i know i'm
[19:45] strange i get it
[19:46] i'm ok sorry but it's like
[19:50] brother branham came and he's going to
[19:52] clothe us in the wedding garments of the
[19:54] word
[19:54] so we have a perfect word that we can
[19:56] present ourselves to
[19:58] to god almighty for this wedding right
[20:01] and that i don't know how to do this but
[20:03] let's say there's a figure of a woman
[20:06] and it's a dress let's say it's like
[20:08] this
[20:10] okay i do nothing more than this let's
[20:12] say this is the dress
[20:14] but i'm like this now i could say
[20:18] that's the right dress that is the
[20:20] perfect word of god
[20:22] i can rejoice in the fact that that is
[20:24] absolutely the truth
[20:26] but you realize that i've got to get
[20:28] this and that
[20:31] you realize that see i don't i just move
[20:34] on
[20:35] you get word pictures you understand
[20:38] what i'm saying
[20:39] it's a funny way of saying i believe
[20:42] that we have a perfect word but i
[20:44] believe that that word is supposed to be
[20:46] cutting me down to size
[20:48] to get into it i'm not here to just say
[20:51] praise god i'm chosen praise god i'm
[20:52] chosen praise god i'm chosen i'm
[20:54] rejoicing
[20:55] i'm rejoicing in the fact there's
[20:57] there's something on the inside of me
[20:59] there's some portion of god that's
[21:01] saying cut me
[21:03] slice me put me on a diet do whatever
[21:05] you got to do
[21:06] get me in that dress get me in that
[21:09] dress
[21:10] i want to just fit that dress i'm not
[21:13] going to come to god
[21:14] any other form than what the prophet of
[21:16] god laid out as the form which which he
[21:19] has to be
[21:20] in to approach him but that takes you
[21:24] like god can do one portion of it he
[21:26] gave his word
[21:28] but now he's looking for the other side
[21:30] the woman that can receive it
[21:32] and that's what cuts you down to size
[21:35] that is what cuts you down the size
[21:37] i want to take some time and just
[21:38] continue look at that with elijah you
[21:40] could turn to first kings
[21:42] 18.
[21:46] first kings 18 says elijah came unto all
[21:49] the people and said
[21:50] how long hawkey between two opinions
[21:53] if the lord be god follow him but if
[21:56] baal then follow him
[21:58] and the people answered him not a word
[22:01] here was israel in this hybridized
[22:04] mixture
[22:05] of worship to god both with their idea
[22:08] idolatry and some form of mixed in
[22:11] religion
[22:12] there for worshiping jehovah it was a
[22:14] mixture
[22:15] and here comes elijah and elijah god's
[22:17] mercy to the people was to send elijah
[22:20] and what did they do they all gather
[22:21] around and he calls them to it
[22:23] he rebuilds the altar brother banham
[22:25] says he or the bible says he rebuilt the
[22:27] altar
[22:27] and in the evening time all men gather
[22:30] around to see this great showdown again
[22:32] between
[22:32] god and the prophets of balaam right
[22:36] and so every man is gathered around and
[22:38] in first kings 18
[22:39] says and the fire of the lord fell and
[22:42] consumed
[22:43] i'm sorry if the lord be god follow him
[22:47] if baal
[22:48] then follow him and the people answered
[22:50] him not a word i find that tremendous
[22:53] the people won't respond at this point
[22:55] there in verse 21
[22:57] now in verse 38 then the fire of the
[22:59] lord fell
[23:00] and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[23:02] wood and the stones and the dust and
[23:04] licked up the water
[23:05] that was in the trench and when all the
[23:07] people saw it
[23:09] they fell on their faces and said the
[23:10] lord he is the
[23:12] he is the god the lord he is
[23:15] the god so
[23:18] in the service they had a great showdown
[23:21] and in the service with god's prophet on
[23:24] the scene
[23:25] every man fell it says all the people
[23:28] worshiped and said this is god everybody
[23:32] did when
[23:32] in the service when the prophet of god
[23:34] is there and the fire of god is coming
[23:36] down to vindicate the word that's been
[23:38] spoken
[23:39] all men no man could doubt it every man
[23:41] said this is the lord
[23:43] but if you look further on in first
[23:46] kings after
[23:47] elijah has this great showdown and he
[23:49] kills the 400 prophets of balaam
[23:51] then at the threat of a woman you know
[23:53] his eagle eye got filmed over
[23:55] but god wanted to get him to himself
[23:57] there's another side of it but when he
[23:58] was
[23:59] out there he says in first kings 19 18
[24:03] yet i have left me seven thousand in
[24:05] israel
[24:06] all the knees which have not bowed unto
[24:09] balaam
[24:09] and every mouth which had not kissed him
[24:13] i thought all the men bowed i thought
[24:16] everybody had declared that this
[24:18] is god you know in the service they did
[24:21] but when the service was over when the
[24:24] fire wasn't falling anymore
[24:27] when there wasn't the vindication right
[24:29] there in front of them that this is the
[24:30] prophet of god and this is the word of
[24:32] god and this is god moving
[24:34] when it went back to normal life a
[24:36] little kiss here
[24:38] a little worship over here a little
[24:40] compromise to keep my fellowship
[24:45] and in god's eyes what was that idolatry
[24:50] see all of them in the service had no
[24:53] problem saying we will worship god
[24:55] but when it came to everyday life
[24:57] decisions
[24:59] they didn't stay with him they didn't
[25:02] you know what they did they committed
[25:04] idolatry
[25:06] and god refused him he forsook them
[25:09] these were god's chosen people israel
[25:11] was god's chosen people
[25:13] but out of all of those chosen there was
[25:16] only seven
[25:17] thousand in there that would choose him
[25:20] they were chosen but there was only a
[25:22] small group that actually chose him
[25:25] they wouldn't make a slight compromise
[25:27] they wouldn't bow
[25:28] and kiss a little idol for maybe a job
[25:31] or a career
[25:31] family fellowship or friendship or
[25:33] anything like that you see you bring it
[25:35] to present tense we have a role to play
[25:37] too
[25:37] and what i find out is the more i'm
[25:39] looking at the word of god you know this
[25:41] i won't say sisters i'll say brothers
[25:42] too you clean a house
[25:44] if you clean it at night it looks pretty
[25:46] clean but the brighter the light
[25:49] shows a lot of dust i believe the more
[25:52] presence and time you spent in the
[25:54] present in the word
[25:56] it starts to do something in your own
[25:57] life where you now feel yourself
[26:00] you see the little slight blemish
[26:03] compromises along the way
[26:05] how many times brother branham says will
[26:07] you as a preacher shirk someone's
[26:10] you don't want to hurt somebody's
[26:11] feelings so you won't preach the truth
[26:14] you know now here's my question your
[26:17] messiahs
[26:18] how many times for the sake of
[26:19] maintaining a relationship with a friend
[26:21] or a family member will you not confront
[26:24] something that you know you should
[26:26] and say it's right or say it's wrong or
[26:28] take your stand
[26:29] because you don't want to lose a friend
[26:32] you don't want to
[26:33] hurt a relationship you know what you're
[26:35] doing you're making decisions based upon
[26:37] human emotions and not upon your
[26:38] revelation of
[26:39] it's better to honor god than to keep a
[26:43] few friends on this earth
[26:44] jesus said if you if they hated me they
[26:47] will hate you
[26:49] he said woe is you to when all men speak
[26:52] well
[26:52] of you the truth of the matter is if all
[26:55] men speak well of you
[26:57] i doubt that you're taking very much of
[26:59] a stand with him
[27:01] because everybody rejects him but if
[27:04] everybody in the world loves you
[27:08] something's wrong i wonder if you're
[27:11] you know kissing bale a little bit i
[27:14] wonder if you're you know
[27:16] compromising a little bit here and there
[27:18] you know for a job
[27:20] for a relationship for family
[27:23] for lost loved ones for lost children
[27:27] i don't believe in that i don't believe
[27:29] in any of that
[27:30] i believe god has a people that would
[27:32] choose him the disciples said
[27:34] what about us lord we forsook all we
[27:37] left
[27:38] mothers and fathers and all of these
[27:40] things
[27:41] and i have this thought in my mind you
[27:43] know what jesus when they came to jesus
[27:44] and he says hey your mother and brothers
[27:45] are here
[27:46] he said who is my mother and brothers
[27:49] those that do the will of god they are
[27:51] my mother and they are my brothers
[27:53] who is my family my family is the one
[27:56] i'm looking at
[27:58] my family are the ones that do the will
[27:59] of god that's my mother
[28:01] that's my brothers but you see there's
[28:05] these slight little compromises along
[28:07] the way that are actually proving you're
[28:08] not making him your choice
[28:13] hebrews 11 6 but without faith
[28:16] it is impossible to please him
[28:19] without faith means there's no human
[28:22] intellectual understanding and saying
[28:23] well i'll do a little bit of this with a
[28:25] little bit of this and hopefully i'll
[28:26] get a good result
[28:28] not going to work guys either apply the
[28:30] word with faith or it does not produce
[28:32] anything just like my daughter she could
[28:35] pray but she had to believe
[28:36] that god was going to honor the word
[28:40] and james it says wherefore lay apart
[28:42] all filthiness and super
[28:44] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[28:46] with meekness the engrafted word which
[28:48] is able to save your souls
[28:51] but be ye doers of the word
[28:54] and not hears only deceiving
[28:57] yourselves what a deception
[29:01] that is the worst of deceptions is
[29:04] you're hearing the word
[29:05] constantly but you're failing to put it
[29:07] into action
[29:08] and you're the most deceived of all
[29:12] completely deceived what good is to hear
[29:15] the word if we don't obey it
[29:17] what good is it if we don't apply it if
[29:19] we don't take god
[29:20] at his word what good is it it can't
[29:22] actually produce anything you understand
[29:24] that
[29:25] the seed can sit right there on this
[29:27] table
[29:28] and will never bring forth a life but if
[29:30] it falls into good ground
[29:32] a faith to receive it and believe it it
[29:34] will produce
[29:35] but that's a conscious choice you must
[29:37] make every single day
[29:39] i want you to turn to esther
[29:50] brother chad brought this out when we
[29:53] were looking at it and
[29:54] you know god's been very gracious to us
[29:56] i believe
[29:57] you know i do you believe that god
[30:01] moves the ministry to say the things
[30:03] that need said at the right time
[30:04] in the right way to mold ascension see i
[30:06] actually believe that the holy spirit
[30:08] is anointing the things that are being
[30:10] said i don't think we're gathering
[30:11] around just saying that was a good one
[30:13] no i think that's oh god god just
[30:15] checked us
[30:16] you know brother nathaniel he opened up
[30:18] his eyes and said hey you didn't play
[30:19] the right tune at the right way at the
[30:21] right time you know with the composer
[30:23] so when the ministry is addressing
[30:25] something to us as a people i believe
[30:26] that's god speaking correcting us
[30:28] getting us into the right form so we can
[30:30] put on the wedding garment and approach
[30:32] him the right way
[30:33] i believe that i don't believe anything
[30:35] is by accident
[30:36] i believe that god is intimately
[30:37] involved in every detail of my life i
[30:39] believe he's involved in every detail of
[30:40] this church and the ministry that
[30:42] preaches
[30:42] and the things they preach i believe are
[30:44] ordained of god at the time that they
[30:45] speak them
[30:46] they're serving some purpose and when
[30:48] brother branham or when brother chad was
[30:50] bringing out there
[30:51] with vashti and esther and we see that
[30:53] there was a dominating woman spirit
[30:55] there that was there present
[30:56] in the presence of the king that wanted
[30:58] to usurp her authority and usurp her
[31:00] will and usurp her ways
[31:02] and not come to subjection to the king's
[31:06] will
[31:07] i believe that was a warning i believe
[31:09] like when brother nathaniel said hey
[31:10] you better follow the sheet music and
[31:12] you better play your tune you can't be
[31:14] saying hey i want to have a solo part
[31:16] i can't be saying oh i wish i was a
[31:18] different instrument i believe that god
[31:20] is looking for us to play the right tune
[31:22] in the right way to say the right thing
[31:24] in the right way to play our part
[31:26] because this is his
[31:27] it's about him this whole thing is about
[31:30] him you know i don't want to just be
[31:33] glorying in the fact that i'm the bride
[31:35] i want to be glorian in the fact that
[31:36] hi god found a person that's willing to
[31:38] obey him that's willing to believe him
[31:40] and accept him
[31:41] not just say i'm so happy that i'm a
[31:44] bride i am so happy i'm a bride
[31:46] but i pray that i am one of those chosen
[31:48] ones that will constantly be making him
[31:50] my choice
[31:51] every single day and esther it says here
[31:55] and i
[31:56] i want to read this whole portion of
[31:57] this okay esther
[32:00] chapter 2 verse 9
[32:04] if you're turning there
[32:13] and the maiden pleased him and she
[32:15] obtained kindness of him
[32:17] and he speedily gave her her things for
[32:20] purification
[32:22] with such things as belonged to her the
[32:25] seven maidens which were
[32:26] meet to be given her out of the king's
[32:30] house and he preferred her and her maids
[32:32] unto the best place in the house of the
[32:36] women
[32:37] esther had not showed her people nor her
[32:40] kindred
[32:41] for mordecai had charged her that she
[32:43] should not show it
[32:44] and mordecai walked every day in the
[32:47] court of the women's
[32:48] of the house to know how esther did and
[32:51] what should become of her
[32:52] now when every man made turn was come
[32:56] to go into king
[32:59] azariah after that she had been 12
[33:03] months according to the manner of the
[33:04] women
[33:05] for so were the days of her prayer of
[33:07] purification
[33:08] accomplished to which six months with
[33:10] oil and myrrh in six months with sweet
[33:12] odors and
[33:13] the other things for the purifying of
[33:14] the women then thus came
[33:16] every maiden unto the king whatsoever
[33:20] she desired was given her
[33:22] to go with her out of the house of the
[33:25] women
[33:26] unto the king's house in the evening
[33:29] she went and on the morrow she returned
[33:32] into the second house of the women to
[33:35] the custody of
[33:38] the king's chamberlain which kept the
[33:40] concubine she came
[33:42] in unto the king no more except the king
[33:44] delighted in her
[33:45] and that she were called by name now
[33:49] when the turn of esther the daughter of
[33:52] iblimalai the uncle of mordecai who had
[33:55] taken her for his daughter was come
[33:58] to go in unto the king she required
[34:01] nothing but what haggai the king's
[34:04] chamberlain
[34:05] the keeper of the women appointed and
[34:07] esther obtained
[34:08] favor in the sight of all of them that
[34:10] looked upon her
[34:11] so esther was taken unto the king
[34:14] azarias unto his house
[34:16] royal in the 10th month which is the
[34:20] the the month of tabeth in the seventh
[34:23] year of his reign
[34:24] and but obviously brother chad pointed
[34:26] that out revelations 10
[34:27] 7. and the king loved esther above all
[34:30] the women and she obtained grace and
[34:31] favor in his sight more than the
[34:33] more than all the virgins so that he
[34:37] set the royal crown upon her head and
[34:40] made her
[34:40] queen instead of vashti so
[34:44] i'm bringing that out in the sense that
[34:45] if you remember there's more than just
[34:47] two women on the scene here
[34:49] there's more than just a vashti and
[34:51] there's not just an
[34:52] esther there's a lot of fair young
[34:54] virgins that were chosen
[34:56] there were quite a few and not a one of
[34:59] the people could say hey choose me
[35:01] choose me no they were chosen
[35:02] they didn't go submit a form and say
[35:04] look i'm prettier than most of the
[35:06] people in this town
[35:07] no these were chosen virgins
[35:10] and they all went through a time of
[35:12] purification but if you'll notice
[35:15] along that way they all had one
[35:17] opportunity
[35:18] and that opportunity was they were going
[35:20] to have one chance to present themselves
[35:22] before the king
[35:23] and how they presented themselves to the
[35:26] king dictated
[35:27] his choice of them but actually if you
[35:30] look at it with esther she was the only
[35:32] one that made the king her choice
[35:35] because she only required those things
[35:37] that were haggai and haggai had been in
[35:40] the presence of the king haggy i knew
[35:41] what the king wanted and what he desired
[35:44] and and also esther had seven maidens
[35:47] where were they from the king's house
[35:51] so seven made in seven church ages in
[35:53] the presence of the king these seven
[35:54] maidens were there for her
[35:56] getting ready to approach into the king
[35:59] so out of
[36:00] all of these virgins that were chosen
[36:03] only one made him her choice
[36:07] only one she required nothing more she
[36:12] didn't say i'm going to add a little bit
[36:14] more
[36:14] she didn't say i'm going to take a
[36:16] little bit away from it
[36:18] no she said she called a little
[36:21] revelation
[36:22] she must have known they knew what they
[36:24] were talking about
[36:26] something down on the inside she said
[36:28] i'm not gonna take
[36:29] one thing more than what he desires
[36:32] she knew that haggai and these seven
[36:35] maidens had been in his presence from
[36:37] the king's house
[36:38] they knew what he was looking for they
[36:40] knew it
[36:41] and i am convinced maybe it's just me
[36:45] now this is kyle but i'm convinced when
[36:47] the king
[36:47] saw her he must have noticed she didn't
[36:50] require
[36:51] anything else there wasn't anything more
[36:54] she was trying to bring to the table
[36:56] she wasn't kind of painting up her face
[36:58] she wasn't trying to make herself more
[36:59] glamorous
[37:00] she wasn't trying to make herself more
[37:01] beautiful she must have had something
[37:03] that he noticed inside of her it must
[37:05] have been a character
[37:06] to just do what he desires
[37:10] nothing more nothing less remember
[37:14] there's no beauty that we
[37:15] should desire him and the brother bam
[37:18] said there's no beauty that we should
[37:20] desire here
[37:22] she is attracted to the i'll get to it
[37:25] but brother branham says
[37:26] what attracts his attention humble
[37:29] obedience to the word
[37:31] that attracts the attention of our king
[37:34] that's all that attracts he's not
[37:35] looking for how great you can do
[37:37] anything
[37:38] he just wants to see how obedient you'll
[37:39] be with the little things
[37:41] that's what attracts the king and that's
[37:43] the kind of bride he was looking for
[37:46] he's trying to find a wife that is
[37:48] complementary to his nature
[37:50] and that is one of complete obedience to
[37:52] the word
[37:55] you understand what i'm saying i'm sorry
[37:58] i like to keep going if that's okay
[38:00] though to lay these things in
[38:02] in choosing of a bride he says now
[38:05] notice
[38:06] it's interesting how you notice that the
[38:08] churches tries to attract the attention
[38:10] of people with their fine robes and
[38:12] their dressed choirs and their bobbed
[38:14] hair women and
[38:14] their painted faces and they think that
[38:16] they can sing like an angel and then lie
[38:18] like a devil and run around all day and
[38:20] night and dance
[38:21] and think nothing about it and that's
[38:23] what they think it's all right
[38:25] see it's beautiful but you see that's
[38:28] false made
[38:29] that is not the word of god while the
[38:32] true bride will attract his attention
[38:34] the attention of god by keeping his word
[38:37] notice
[38:38] let us notice christ but he didn't come
[38:41] in a kind of beauty
[38:42] he always comes in the beauty of
[38:44] character
[38:45] there christ wasn't big beautiful strong
[38:47] and stout
[38:48] god doesn't choose that kind of a man he
[38:51] ain't looking for great big shiny things
[38:54] he's looking for simple quiet obedience
[38:57] no beauty it really is no beauty it
[39:00] could be simply
[39:01] conducting yourself at work in a godly
[39:04] manner
[39:05] and that'll be the attraction of the
[39:06] king it could be a wife that stays in
[39:08] subject into her husband
[39:09] and that's all he was looking for it
[39:11] could be you just played the instrument
[39:13] that was giving you
[39:15] at the right time the way he wanted to
[39:18] to complete his great symphony like
[39:20] brother nathaniel spoke about
[39:21] it could just be that are you content in
[39:24] that are you looking for something great
[39:26] grand and shiny
[39:27] because if you are you won't find him
[39:30] you won't find him
[39:31] i think so many times we want tickled a
[39:33] little bit we want to be
[39:34] flashy we want to see something flash we
[39:36] want to do something flash we want to do
[39:38] something that looks great in the eyes
[39:40] of man
[39:41] but it doesn't look great in the eyes of
[39:42] god that's not what he was looking for
[39:45] and the masterpiece he says she is
[39:47] smitten from the church
[39:49] from the church body she is smitten with
[39:52] her master for what the same purpose
[39:55] she is the word just the same as joseph
[39:58] was smitten from his brethren
[40:00] because he was the word jesus was
[40:03] smitten from his brethren because he was
[40:05] the word
[40:06] and the churches me and the brightest
[40:08] and from the church
[40:09] because she is the word there
[40:12] is your stages again one two three
[40:15] exactly
[40:16] the word living and in action the bible
[40:20] bride not some man-made bride some bible
[40:24] the bible bride is a smitten and
[40:26] afflicted of god with no beauty that we
[40:29] should desire
[40:30] her but we did esteem her
[40:34] smitten and afflicted of god that's
[40:37] right
[40:37] she stands alone she stands alone but
[40:40] she doesn't stand alone completely
[40:42] there'll be one standing with her it'll
[40:45] be him
[40:46] and it's so interesting because that is
[40:48] the bride we want to be
[40:50] i mean can any of you say i want to be
[40:52] stricken smitten of god and cast down
[40:56] when you're willing to say that you'll
[40:57] find him
[40:59] you see what i'm saying it's like in
[41:00] everyday life are you realizing that to
[41:03] take the word
[41:03] it's not always comfortable it's not
[41:06] easy
[41:07] it's not always shouting it's not always
[41:09] the fire coming down and we can all
[41:10] rejoice and say god is our god
[41:12] no it's in the everyday life living a
[41:15] life that's worthy of the gospel
[41:17] everyday life not putting a relationship
[41:20] or a job or a situation above the
[41:22] willing word of god
[41:24] it's an everyday life that enoch walked
[41:26] out of this world
[41:28] i don't think it was one great service i
[41:31] think it was consistently daily
[41:33] taking one step higher one step higher
[41:36] one step higher
[41:38] every day he's my choice every day
[41:41] i believe the word every day i don't
[41:43] care about my emotions or my feelings or
[41:45] my affections
[41:46] every day i want to be found receiving
[41:48] the word and believing
[41:51] uniting time as the bridegroom being the
[41:53] word and the bride being the hearer
[41:56] of the word they come together in a
[41:59] union
[42:00] they unite like a wedding see they're
[42:03] getting ready for the wedding
[42:04] the word becomes you and you become the
[42:07] word
[42:08] i was really provoked this last week i
[42:10] had a conversation with the man i shared
[42:12] it with brother chad
[42:13] this man i had met him nine years ago in
[42:15] the parking lot of meyer i used to go to
[42:17] church with him
[42:18] and he had said uh we he came over the
[42:21] house we got to talk about the lord and
[42:22] he stayed for
[42:23] kerry would know i don't know it's like
[42:24] i don't know five six hours just talking
[42:26] about the lord
[42:27] and i never ran into him again and he
[42:29] showed up at my office this last week
[42:31] and he wanted to talk about the lord we
[42:32] went to panera and we spent five hours
[42:34] talking about the lord
[42:35] and i honestly was provoked and
[42:37] encouraged because you know what he said
[42:38] he said my brother his wife left him so
[42:41] we started to study
[42:42] marriage and divorce and you know what i
[42:44] come to find out
[42:45] he said almost everybody in my church is
[42:47] living in adultery
[42:48] and they don't know it everybody he said
[42:53] the bible says in ezekiel their blood
[42:54] will be on my hands if i don't say
[42:56] something to them
[42:58] and so you know what he's done it
[42:59] provoked me to righteousness into good
[43:01] works
[43:02] he said i have went to every one of them
[43:04] one on one
[43:05] to their house and showed them these
[43:07] scriptures and say
[43:09] we have a problem he went to every one
[43:12] of them
[43:13] he went to his mom he went to his best
[43:15] friend he went to all the members in his
[43:16] church
[43:17] and he told me you know what my best
[43:18] friend told me he said it won't be long
[43:20] you won't have a friend left on this
[43:21] earth
[43:23] he said i'll always have one
[43:26] and i said god bless you man i
[43:28] appreciate that
[43:29] i appreciate a man he's not a believer
[43:32] of the message yet we'll see i don't
[43:33] know
[43:34] he's listening to the indictment
[43:38] so but i said man you don't find that
[43:41] very often
[43:42] this man the portion of the word that he
[43:44] has he's willing to do everything he can
[43:46] he said
[43:47] i have to declare righteousness i have
[43:49] to tell them the truth
[43:50] he says the bible says no fornicators
[43:52] adulterers the feminists shall enter
[43:54] into the kingdom of heaven these people
[43:55] don't even know they're sitting under
[43:57] ministries that are telling them lies
[43:59] they think they're okay and they are not
[44:02] i said god bless you man
[44:04] god bless you one by one losing every
[44:07] friend he had
[44:08] well not everyone was in adultery but
[44:11] the majority of everyone
[44:13] that he fellowshipped with and then they
[44:14] ran him out of the church
[44:16] because he was causing major problems
[44:19] with the assembly so now he's just kind
[44:21] of wandering
[44:22] he wandered over to my shop there last
[44:24] week so
[44:26] pray for him but i think that's
[44:28] something that should be inside of us
[44:30] i don't think we should constantly be
[44:32] looking of i want to stay comfortable
[44:34] i don't want to cause problems i want
[44:35] everybody to like me i want to get along
[44:37] with everybody i'm sorry i don't believe
[44:38] that's what a christian does in this day
[44:40] and age
[44:40] how can we live in satan's eden with
[44:42] this nonsense
[44:44] and only come and shout and praise god
[44:46] at the service and then go out and kiss
[44:48] baal
[44:49] out and be friends with the world i
[44:51] don't think we can do that anymore
[44:53] i think that is done i think we're going
[44:55] to have one opportunity
[44:57] one opportunity to present ourselves in
[44:59] the right wedding garment before the
[45:01] king
[45:01] and i don't want to be one of those fair
[45:02] young virgins that were chosen
[45:04] just to present what kind of life and
[45:06] style and
[45:08] presentation i wanted to give him i want
[45:11] to be presenting to him what he
[45:13] desired and only what fits
[45:16] in that is all i want to bring to him
[45:19] and if it doesn't fit
[45:21] god help me get me in that dress
[45:24] cut me shape me put me on a strict
[45:27] lettuce diet i don't know whatever you
[45:29] got to do
[45:30] get me in that dress you know what i'm
[45:33] saying
[45:34] i'm not just saying i'm not sometimes we
[45:36] come and we when we shout we praise god
[45:37] and we should praise god
[45:39] but you realize that this word was given
[45:41] to you to mold you to shape you
[45:43] to get you into the form of his bride
[45:46] it's not just something we rally around
[45:48] and just say praise god
[45:49] we rally around with humble bowed faces
[45:52] and tears saying god
[45:53] i'm not fitting in that dress get me in
[45:56] that
[45:57] you do what you got to do you cut me to
[45:59] pieces you shred me
[46:01] you fall you fall let me fall upon the
[46:04] rock and be broke into pieces
[46:06] i gotta get in there you know when i
[46:08] came out here i looked in the mirror
[46:10] when i you know
[46:12] that's funny i'm sorry when i look in
[46:14] the mirror so i look in the mirror i
[46:15] don't say
[46:16] that's a handsome man i don't do that
[46:19] no i say man doing the best i can with
[46:22] what i got
[46:23] you know what i'm saying i mean how vain
[46:27] would you be to look in the mirror and
[46:28] say i
[46:29] am one good-looking man you know what
[46:32] i'm saying
[46:33] yeah a sister is it's just you know when
[46:36] you're
[46:36] young you do that maybe when i was young
[46:38] i'd sit there and say not too bad not
[46:39] too bad
[46:40] now i like to say too many oreos that's
[46:43] what that is
[46:44] that's too many horrors right brother
[46:45] shea it's too many oreos
[46:47] me and him love foreign but you know
[46:49] what i'm saying
[46:51] so that's a natural maybe funny way i
[46:54] don't mean to be joking and distract me
[46:56] but when we look into this word and we
[46:58] can see there's the bride there's the
[47:00] bride there's the bride there's the
[47:02] bride there's the bride we don't say
[47:03] that's awesome
[47:04] yeah i am something special wow
[47:08] i'm all over the place he must
[47:12] you see what i'm saying i'm not trying
[47:14] to say it in the wrong way
[47:16] and there's a balance of that because
[47:17] she is special she's beautiful
[47:19] she's wonderful but to see that that is
[47:22] she is that important to him and she
[47:25] must be a certain way
[47:27] she must have a certain life a certain
[47:30] attitude
[47:31] a certain walk if he's showing me it
[47:35] that many times i better be taking a
[47:37] very close look in that mirror and
[47:39] making sure
[47:40] everything is in order because it must
[47:43] be extremely
[47:45] important understand what i'm saying
[47:50] because i think sometimes you can get a
[47:52] little slanted view on that
[47:54] get to thinking i'm super special i am
[47:56] pretty awesome
[47:58] i know you must be wanting to make sure
[48:01] you better see what i'm looking for
[48:05] and i don't say those things to
[48:06] discourage you because even in myself
[48:07] there's a lot that i don't like and
[48:09] there's a lot that isn't getting in that
[48:11] dress yet
[48:12] but by god's grace i know that he put
[48:15] something down on the inside
[48:17] that receives that word and is believing
[48:19] that word
[48:20] and that word will take a hold and
[48:22] produce its own life
[48:24] my job my responsibility is just to
[48:27] believe it and accept it
[48:28] and obey it to be a doer of the word
[48:32] to be the recipient to be the other side
[48:34] of the portion of god the feminine side
[48:36] to just receive that word believe that
[48:38] word
[48:38] knowing that that life is in the seed
[48:41] and it will bring
[48:42] forth christ that's our job
[48:45] that's our responsibility and that's the
[48:47] bride he's looking for
[48:50] a bride that chooses him daily
[48:55] in choosing of the bride he says now
[48:57] stop a minute
[48:59] men look at your creeds that you're
[49:02] serving look at your churches
[49:04] is it just exactly the word of god have
[49:07] you met
[49:07] every qualification say i'm a good man
[49:10] well so was no
[49:11] nicodemus and so was the rest of them
[49:14] they were all very fine
[49:16] that don't have a thing to do with it
[49:18] women
[49:19] i want you to look in the mirror look
[49:22] into what god requires a woman to do
[49:25] see in god's mirror not in your church
[49:28] mirror god's mir and see
[49:32] if you could qualify in your life to be
[49:36] the spiritual bride of jesus christ
[49:42] ministers think the same do you cut
[49:44] corners here to save somebody's feelings
[49:47] would you do this if it wasn't they'll
[49:49] put you out of the church
[49:51] if you have a feeling in that way my
[49:53] dear brother i warn you in the name of
[49:55] jesus christ you flee from that right
[49:58] now i'm not the prophet of god but i
[50:01] would say if you're doing things for
[50:03] people's feelings i warn you in the name
[50:05] of jesus christ
[50:06] you're not measuring up to the
[50:08] qualifications of the bride of jesus
[50:10] christ
[50:12] we must all be looking into this mirror
[50:15] i think we've been thoroughly rebuked
[50:17] on religion versus relationship and that
[50:19] the fact is too many of us were
[50:21] comparing ourselves one with another and
[50:22] saying we're not too bad
[50:24] but i want to tell you in light of this
[50:26] mirror right here this mirror right here
[50:29] you're not fitting in you might not be
[50:33] able to get in that dress
[50:34] you may be chosen now it's your turn
[50:38] many fair young virgins many fair young
[50:41] virgins
[50:42] only one made him her choice
[50:46] it's okay to keep going this is going to
[50:50] take a strange turn titus 2 3.
[50:57] titus 2 3.
[51:07] it says the aged woman likewise that
[51:10] they be
[51:11] in behavior as becometh holiness
[51:14] not false accusers not given to much
[51:17] wine
[51:18] teachers of good things that they may
[51:20] teach
[51:21] the young women to be sober to love
[51:24] their husbands
[51:25] and to love their children to be
[51:27] discreet
[51:28] chaste ver keepers at home
[51:32] good obedient to their husbands
[51:35] that the word of god be not
[51:38] blasphemed
[51:41] now i'm not now i'm saying what i'm
[51:44] going to say
[51:44] in light of this this is a type of the
[51:46] true church of the living god the things
[51:48] that she
[51:49] must maintain and the things that must
[51:52] be her priority
[51:53] just as in the natural realm this does
[51:56] not say
[51:57] older women instruct your younger women
[52:00] how to keep a career
[52:01] how to have a great social life how to
[52:03] do
[52:04] anything beyond take care of your homes
[52:07] take care of your children take care of
[52:09] your children or your husbands
[52:11] you realize that be discreet be chaste
[52:15] be quiet be obedient you understand
[52:20] now i won't go any farther than that you
[52:22] you deal with that how you feel
[52:26] but the church of the living god must be
[52:28] following the same type in a spiritual
[52:30] manner as that woman is
[52:32] her only objective is her home
[52:35] her fam her husband and her children
[52:37] that's it
[52:39] beyond that i'm adding to what he wants
[52:43] out of me following down brother branham
[52:46] says this in the invisible union of the
[52:47] bride of jesus christ now we find
[52:49] that she was given a sacred trust
[52:52] that she must not break of womanhood
[52:57] have her character to raise her children
[53:00] and to be honorable unto her husband
[53:03] nowadays they pay a bit more attention
[53:06] to that than nothing in the world you
[53:09] ought to set in my office sometime and
[53:11] see the type of
[53:12] women men bring in there where they try
[53:15] to get right with god and confess
[53:16] all the men that they've been with and
[53:18] everything else since they've been
[53:19] married
[53:20] i'm speaking of how it can get that way
[53:22] when you get to mixing up with the world
[53:25] and the church and the fashions of these
[53:26] things
[53:27] that we have you're no more like the
[53:29] original pentecostal
[53:31] was in that day from night you've
[53:34] drifted away somewhere into dark chaos
[53:37] somewhere and you're lost
[53:38] what a sacred trust what a
[53:40] responsibility to a woman
[53:42] now we see why she's a type of the
[53:44] church
[53:45] which has the same responsibility
[53:48] as a woman has a sacred responsibility
[53:51] to motherhood
[53:52] to her virtues to her husband the church
[53:55] has a sacred responsibility to prayer
[53:58] and to the word and to christ just the
[54:01] same as this woman has
[54:03] you see you have one thing you must be
[54:07] concerned with
[54:08] prayer the word and obedience to christ
[54:12] that is you the church of the living god
[54:14] the bride of his choosing
[54:16] that is your role anything outside of
[54:19] that
[54:20] not pleasing to him just as a natural
[54:23] you have your three things if any of
[54:25] those things go lacking
[54:27] i don't care what it is you're doing
[54:29] you're disobedient god
[54:30] and you could be bringing blasphemy to
[54:32] the very things you stand for
[54:34] that's what the word says
[54:39] bible or brother brahm says here in
[54:41] lifting him up out of history
[54:43] we have a home life crisis it seems to
[54:46] me like the home is running
[54:48] on shallow water it used to be that in
[54:50] the home the father the head of the
[54:51] house
[54:52] would sit down in the morning he would
[54:53] speak to his family and they would all
[54:54] gather around the old family bible
[54:56] they would read a little bit and they
[54:58] would all gather around the table and
[54:59] have prayer
[55:01] you don't see that no more and when the
[55:03] and when the day was done
[55:05] ma would wash the dishes and then they
[55:07] would all gather around and read some
[55:09] more of the bible and then they would
[55:10] pray and go to bed
[55:13] no beauty in that is there that looks
[55:15] pretty simple
[55:16] looks kind of old-fashioned can we say
[55:19] that we fit into that dress
[55:21] as our homes look like that as our
[55:24] as your sacred motherhood and your
[55:26] sacred family and obedience to the word
[55:28] of god and you're putting the right
[55:29] things in the right place they're in
[55:31] their right priority
[55:34] i have to i'm speaking to me just as
[55:36] well just so you know i'm prioritizing
[55:38] i have to reprioritize there's certain
[55:41] things
[55:41] i love fellowship but what good is
[55:43] fellowship outside the home if my own
[55:45] home isn't
[55:46] set in order the way it ought to be
[55:49] we don't want to measure up to the
[55:51] church we want to measure up to the word
[55:54] that's my mirror that's my glass that
[55:57] i'm supposed to be looking into
[55:59] intently each and every day
[56:06] brother branham says about moses moses
[56:09] had to make a choice
[56:11] moses being the messenger of deliverance
[56:13] to the people of israel
[56:15] god had to give him a choice and now
[56:17] remember moses would have to type that
[56:19] of brother branham
[56:20] moses was given an opportunity brother
[56:22] branham said he could have been pharaoh
[56:24] he could have been
[56:24] king on earth he could have had all the
[56:26] money the popularity everything he
[56:28] wanted this natural flesh could ever
[56:30] desire
[56:31] moses it was offered to him he was
[56:34] chosen
[56:34] he was elected of god but he still had
[56:37] to make a choice
[56:38] he still had to make a choice and the
[56:40] bible says he chose christ suffering
[56:43] choosing rather to suffer the reproach
[56:45] of christ esteeming christ greater
[56:47] riches than that of egypt
[56:49] right now here's what he says he
[56:53] rejected
[56:54] the popularity he could have had young
[56:56] girls by the hundreds
[56:58] and he could have had
[57:01] sep curse in egypt and had ruled the
[57:04] world
[57:04] the world laid right at his feet he was
[57:07] heir to all of it
[57:08] but by looking in the scripture and
[57:10] seeing the day that he was living in he
[57:13] knowed
[57:13] he knowed that something was in him a
[57:16] predestinated seed
[57:18] went to of god went to work i don't care
[57:21] how popular you could be
[57:23] i don't care how you could be a
[57:26] presbyter you could be a pastor
[57:28] you could be this you could be that but
[57:30] if that word of eternal life
[57:32] god's eternal life by god's word
[57:35] has been foreordained in you you will
[57:38] see
[57:38] that thing at hand and it goes to work
[57:42] moving out like that and he refused to
[57:45] be called the son of pharaoh's daughter
[57:47] because he esteemed the reproach of
[57:49] christ greater riches than the riches of
[57:51] egypt
[57:51] or of this world he esteemed that
[57:54] watch what he done he followed it up
[57:57] quickly he was
[57:59] ousted by his people and the people that
[58:02] once
[58:02] loved him you know it might cost you
[58:05] everything
[58:06] it might cost you your home it might
[58:08] cost you your friendship
[58:09] it might cost you your stitch and soap
[58:11] party it might cost you your place there
[58:13] in the kiwanis
[58:14] it might i don't know what it will cost
[58:17] you but
[58:18] it will cost you everything that this
[58:20] world or pertains to this world
[58:23] you will have to separate yourself in
[58:25] everything that's worldly
[58:27] moses laid aside everything and went
[58:29] into a desert with a stick in his hand
[58:32] days went by and he wondered did i make
[58:34] a mistake no
[58:36] many times people start off and they say
[58:39] oh
[58:39] i'll do i'll do it glory to god and then
[58:42] someone laughs at you and makes fun of
[58:44] you
[58:44] and then you begin to wonder did i do
[58:46] wrong he said they
[58:48] they cannot stand chasm if they cannot
[58:50] stand chastisement they are bastard
[58:52] children and not
[58:53] children of mine see they worked up all
[58:56] in emotion
[58:57] but if that see that seed that i talked
[59:00] about a while ago the soul
[59:02] wasn't there to start with it was
[59:04] anointed with the spirit
[59:05] and he'd done all kinds of things you
[59:07] see he was just anointed on his spirit
[59:10] but when the real holy ghost comes in it
[59:12] produces a life
[59:15] and that's the reality of it you've got
[59:18] to go through a testing
[59:19] moses had to go through his testing but
[59:21] what is it if you're a predestinated
[59:24] seed of god if you
[59:25] are the elect bride of jesus christ
[59:28] you'll look at anything of this world
[59:30] and say it's worth
[59:31] giving that up to follow this word he is
[59:35] worth
[59:36] everything to me
[59:39] so just as moses had to make a choice
[59:42] brother branham had to make a choice
[59:44] brother branham wasn't only just the
[59:46] seven church age messenger he's also a
[59:48] type of the bride
[59:50] brother branham marriage and divorce
[59:52] because thou
[59:53] hast chosen the narrow path the harder
[59:57] way
[59:58] thou hast walked in your own
[1:00:02] choosing thou has picked
[1:00:05] the correct and the precise decision
[1:00:09] and it was my way because of this
[1:00:12] momentous decision a huge portion of
[1:00:15] heaven
[1:00:16] will await thee what a glorious decision
[1:00:19] thou hast made
[1:00:20] now you know the next this in
[1:00:23] itself is that which will give
[1:00:28] and make to come to pass the tremendous
[1:00:31] victory
[1:00:32] in love divine he made a choice
[1:00:36] he had to make a choice he was called of
[1:00:40] god
[1:00:41] he was a prophet of god but along the
[1:00:43] way he had to make his
[1:00:45] own choice and because he was a
[1:00:48] predestinated seed of god
[1:00:50] he would choose the right way this
[1:00:53] shall make and come to bring to pass a
[1:00:56] tremendous victory
[1:00:57] in love divine when you can make him
[1:01:01] your choice not that he chose you which
[1:01:04] he did
[1:01:05] but now a tremendous victory in divine
[1:01:07] love will be when you
[1:01:08] can choose him just as your prophet
[1:01:12] chose him so does this bride choose him
[1:01:15] if you think about it this is
[1:01:16] revelations 10.
[1:01:19] uh oh okay let me fill this in first
[1:01:21] sorry i just skipped
[1:01:22] the true easter seal i could go that way
[1:01:25] i sure could
[1:01:26] brother bam says see you choose it
[1:01:29] yourself moses had to make his choice he
[1:01:31] didn't have to do it
[1:01:32] neither did i have to take this path i
[1:01:35] could have had big buildings
[1:01:37] out yonder and some of them things i
[1:01:39] could have been all across the
[1:01:41] television
[1:01:42] but who would sponsor me uh on
[1:01:45] tearing tearing the very foundation
[1:01:48] but one thing i don't have to bow down
[1:01:50] to nobody
[1:01:51] but to the lord jesus christ that's
[1:01:53] right yes
[1:01:54] i get to preach what the bible says and
[1:01:57] i don't have to compromise with any of
[1:01:59] their organizations
[1:02:00] i don't have to belong to none of them i
[1:02:02] made my choice
[1:02:03] just like he said up there as i was with
[1:02:06] moses
[1:02:06] so will i be with you he made christ
[1:02:10] his choice he had an opportunity god
[1:02:13] gave him one
[1:02:14] god blessed him in this ministry god
[1:02:16] blessed him in his service
[1:02:18] and god gave him a choice god will bless
[1:02:21] you
[1:02:21] he will do mighty wonderful wonderful
[1:02:23] works for you
[1:02:25] but then he'll want to see what kind of
[1:02:26] choice you're going to make
[1:02:29] it's a momentous decision as it is in
[1:02:32] revelations chapter 7
[1:02:34] so is it in revelations chapter 8 and i
[1:02:37] heard a voice
[1:02:38] that spake from heaven say to me again
[1:02:41] and said go
[1:02:42] take the little book that's in that's
[1:02:44] open in the hand of the angel that
[1:02:45] standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:02:47] and i went to the angel and i said unto
[1:02:49] him give me the little book
[1:02:51] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[1:02:53] up and it will make thy belly bitter but
[1:02:56] in thy mouth
[1:02:56] it will be sweet as honey a word spoken
[1:03:00] but then it had to be taken it had to be
[1:03:03] a choice a something inside of you that
[1:03:06] says give it to me
[1:03:07] it's mine just as brother branham what
[1:03:10] is the third pole his hands are
[1:03:12] up and then a sword strikes his hand he
[1:03:15] says
[1:03:16] that's the king's sword but what did he
[1:03:18] say it took a strong hand of faith to
[1:03:20] hold it
[1:03:21] so it must take a strong predestined
[1:03:24] hand it's predestinated hand to be able
[1:03:26] to take a hold of this word
[1:03:27] just as it was in the prophet so must it
[1:03:30] be a strong
[1:03:31] dead or strong predestinated hand of
[1:03:34] faith
[1:03:34] of this bride of his choosing that will
[1:03:37] choose him and take the word
[1:03:39] and the word only
[1:03:43] i'd like to read one more
[1:03:46] i'm going fast
[1:03:49] i like to lay the scripture in ii
[1:03:51] timothy 3 1
[1:03:54] and this know also that in the last days
[1:03:57] perilous times come
[1:03:58] shall come from men shall be lovers of
[1:04:01] their own selves
[1:04:02] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:04:05] disobedient unthankful and unholy
[1:04:08] without natural affection truce breakers
[1:04:09] false accusers incontinent
[1:04:11] fierce despisers of those that are good
[1:04:14] traitors heady high-minded
[1:04:15] and lovers of pleasure more than lovers
[1:04:18] of god didn't say that they didn't love
[1:04:20] god just loved pleasure more than god
[1:04:25] you know sing and shout and praise god
[1:04:27] when the fire is falling there and
[1:04:28] consuming the sacrifice on a sunday and
[1:04:30] wednesday
[1:04:32] but on the other days
[1:04:35] having a form of godliness and denying
[1:04:37] the power thereof
[1:04:39] from such turn away for of this sword is
[1:04:43] those that lead
[1:04:43] that creep into houses and lead cr lead
[1:04:47] captive silly women laden with sins
[1:04:49] led away with diverse loves lusts
[1:04:52] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:04:55] the knowledge of truth
[1:04:57] now as janus and jammer swiss did moses
[1:04:59] so that these would
[1:05:00] resist the truth men of corrupt minds
[1:05:02] reprobate concerning
[1:05:03] the faith but they shall proceed no
[1:05:06] further for the father
[1:05:07] far further for their folly shall be
[1:05:09] made manifested unto men
[1:05:11] as theirs was also but thou has fully
[1:05:14] known my doctrine my manner of life
[1:05:16] my purpose faith long-suffering charity
[1:05:19] and patience
[1:05:20] persecutions and afflictions which came
[1:05:22] to me at antioch and
[1:05:24] at ikeanum at lystra what persecutions i
[1:05:27] endured
[1:05:28] but out of them all the lord delivered
[1:05:31] me
[1:05:31] yea and all that live godly in christ
[1:05:35] jesus shall
[1:05:36] suffer persecution amen
[1:05:40] one thing's for sure paul gave us a good
[1:05:42] example of what that bride looks like
[1:05:44] she will suffer greatly for him she has
[1:05:48] to
[1:05:49] he's worth it matthew 11
[1:05:53] come unto me all ye that laban are heavy
[1:05:55] laden and i will give you rest
[1:05:57] take my yoke upon me upon you and learn
[1:06:01] of me
[1:06:02] i meek and lowly in heart and ye shall
[1:06:06] find
[1:06:06] rest unto your souls for my yoke is
[1:06:09] easy and my burden is light
[1:06:14] i'd like to play something if it's okay
[1:06:16] just for a little bit i had brother
[1:06:18] franco cue it up i could read it but no
[1:06:20] one can say it better than brother
[1:06:21] branham sometimes
[1:06:23] brother franco could you uh play that
[1:06:25] small portion
[1:06:26] from the rapture i remember that night
[1:06:30] before i seen that
[1:06:31] i've seen the preview of the bride i
[1:06:33] stood there and seen a beautiful
[1:06:35] little lady's just correctly dressed and
[1:06:37] they marching this way there's somebody
[1:06:39] standing by me in the division
[1:06:40] and i've seen that said the preview of
[1:06:41] the bride i've seen her go by they come
[1:06:43] on this side went around
[1:06:45] not already coming up the churches
[1:06:46] coming up from this other side
[1:06:48] there come the asian church oh you talk
[1:06:50] about phil
[1:06:51] here come the european church oh my and
[1:06:55] then i heard a rock and roll coming and
[1:06:57] it was
[1:06:58] miss america the church and she didn't
[1:07:00] even have on any clothes
[1:07:01] she had papers like newspapers great
[1:07:04] hold in front of her
[1:07:05] dancing by rock and roll miss america
[1:07:08] the church i stood there in his presence
[1:07:10] i thought oh god as a minister
[1:07:12] if that's the best we could do oh oh you
[1:07:14] know how you feel i thought
[1:07:15] god hiding if i could just get away from
[1:07:17] here if all that we've done and that's
[1:07:19] what we have to produce
[1:07:20] if that's why and then when women pass
[1:07:22] by all doing all kinds of rocks and
[1:07:24] things and
[1:07:25] short hair and painted faces and as it
[1:07:27] passed by like that's supposed to be
[1:07:28] virgins the crimes and when she passed
[1:07:31] by like that
[1:07:31] i turned my head you know what the this
[1:07:33] whole land from me is is this graceful
[1:07:35] the back of them
[1:07:36] and there was going like and i turned my
[1:07:38] head they're weeping like
[1:07:39] i said i couldn't stand it there him
[1:07:41] stand there and me know that me a
[1:07:43] minister of the church and that's why i
[1:07:44] produced for him
[1:07:45] that's an old god i can't look at it let
[1:07:48] me die
[1:07:48] let me let me fade away and like that
[1:07:51] and as soon as it went out
[1:07:52] every time one of them would come they
[1:07:53] go out to a certain place and drop off
[1:07:55] and i just hear the sound of it as it
[1:07:56] went away
[1:07:57] and then i heard something like onward
[1:07:59] christian soldiers
[1:08:00] now look here come that sainted bunch of
[1:08:02] little girls just exactly the way it was
[1:08:04] all correctly dressed their hairs
[1:08:06] hanging way down in their back
[1:08:08] smooth clean marching like this to the
[1:08:10] step of the gospel
[1:08:12] she was a word that looked like one out
[1:08:15] of every nation
[1:08:16] i was looking at as it passed by and
[1:08:18] seen them pass by
[1:08:19] instead of going down they started going
[1:08:22] up now i noticed one of them trying two
[1:08:23] three i'm trying to get outline i
[1:08:24] screamed stay in line
[1:08:26] and the vision left me and i was
[1:08:28] standing in this room screaming stay in
[1:08:29] line
[1:08:31] lying that wonder could it be already
[1:08:34] passed could the bride already be called
[1:08:37] is that what we're going through today
[1:08:39] she has to be molded and made
[1:08:41] into the image of christ and christ is
[1:08:44] the word
[1:08:45] that's the only thing sits in there in
[1:08:47] the words ju
[1:08:48] see there cannot be one thing added it
[1:08:50] can't be a woman with a
[1:08:52] one hand like a man and the other hand
[1:08:54] with a paw like a dog
[1:08:56] it's got to be exactly the word of the
[1:08:58] lord like he
[1:09:00] is the word the bride is a part of the
[1:09:02] bridegroom
[1:09:03] the woman is a part of her husband
[1:09:05] because she's taken out of the husband
[1:09:07] eve was a part of adam from his side and
[1:09:10] so
[1:09:10] is a pride not taken from a denomination
[1:09:13] but taken from the bosom
[1:09:14] of the word of god for this day
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:24] that's what we want to be you find the
[1:09:26] similarities of this preview of the
[1:09:28] bride
[1:09:29] esther all these fairy young virgins
[1:09:32] supposed to be virgins to christ
[1:09:34] supposed to have been made
[1:09:35] him their choice but their folly was
[1:09:38] made known
[1:09:40] they added to and took away from the
[1:09:41] word of god
[1:09:43] and it was not the bride he was looking
[1:09:45] for he had one that he was looking for
[1:09:48] and this is what she was exactly
[1:09:51] what she was will you stand
[1:09:58] i love you guys i really
[1:10:01] and i pray that you make him your choice
[1:10:07] i pray that every day you esteem him
[1:10:10] greater than anything that this world
[1:10:12] could offer
[1:10:13] family friends you know you have
[1:10:15] different things that you'll have to
[1:10:16] give up for him
[1:10:18] we don't have a pharaoh type position
[1:10:21] that we're giving up
[1:10:22] but we nonetheless have to give
[1:10:24] something up
[1:10:25] we'll have to give up friendships jobs
[1:10:28] relationships things that are dear to us
[1:10:30] in this natural world
[1:10:32] but if it's at the cost of christ it's
[1:10:34] worth giving up
[1:10:36] it's just worth giving up i pray that
[1:10:39] this is a blessing and i pray that you
[1:10:42] look at the word and seeing the bride in
[1:10:43] the word and from a condition of saying
[1:10:45] am i matching
[1:10:47] am i doing what he said am i actually
[1:10:49] making
[1:10:50] am i wanting god to actually shape me
[1:10:53] and mold me into that image
[1:10:55] or not let's just bow our heads for a
[1:10:57] word of prayer
[1:11:00] heavenly father we come before you lord
[1:11:03] we do thank you for
[1:11:05] what you've done and lord we do kind of
[1:11:08] in a somber way

[1:11:11] many sins forgive us for our many
[1:11:13] compromises
[1:11:14] lord we want to be found as that one
[1:11:17] virgin
[1:11:18] that makes you your her choice in
[1:11:21] everyday life

[1:11:25] with the world
[1:11:26] not compromising for the sake of
[1:11:28] somebody's feelings
[1:11:30] not compromising not comparing ourselves
[1:11:32] with our church or one with the other
[1:11:34] but lord earnestly sincerely looking
[1:11:37] at your word this revealed truth looking
[1:11:40] at it
[1:11:41] looking at you and trying to see do we
[1:11:44] match
[1:11:45] or don't we and being honest when we
[1:11:47] don't
[1:11:49] and i just pray lord god no doubt you've
[1:11:51] been searching my heart
[1:11:52] i pray that you would search the hearts
[1:11:54] of those that i love so dearly in front
[1:11:56] of me
[1:11:57] and those that would listen lord we want
[1:11:59] to be found as that spiritual bride that
[1:12:01] you are looking for
[1:12:03] not just in form but in a living word
[1:12:06] made
[1:12:06] manifest father i pray that you would do
[1:12:10] that
[1:12:10] i pray that you would quicken us father
[1:12:14] may and i know that they will that
[1:12:16] predestinated bride
[1:12:18] they will make you their choice they
[1:12:21] will
[1:12:22] because there's something on the inside
[1:12:24] calling out for you

[1:12:28] into your hands
[1:12:29] and just thank you for all that you've

[1:14:32] [Music]
[1:14:40] amen praise the lord you know i think
[1:14:43] it's good every once in a while
[1:14:45] to reflect to look hard
[1:14:48] and fast in the word of god and look at
[1:14:51] ourselves
[1:14:52] because there's a way these creepers
[1:14:54] have a way of creeping in
[1:14:56] brother ben talked about the little
[1:14:57] creeper got in and would wind its way
[1:15:00] slowly
[1:15:00] around the corner and next thing you
[1:15:02] know it's pulled it down and it's
[1:15:03] deformed it
[1:15:04] it didn't happen overnight it didn't
[1:15:06] happen instantly
[1:15:07] it happened so unnoticeably then all of
[1:15:10] a sudden it deformed the corn
[1:15:12] and i say lord if there's any creeper
[1:15:14] getting around me lord cut it away
[1:15:17] cut it away take this word show me
[1:15:20] myself and your word and cut away
[1:15:22] anything that would bring a deformity
[1:15:24] anything that would not be pleasing to
[1:15:25] you
[1:15:26] i was thinking about what he was saying
[1:15:29] what brother kyle was saying about
[1:15:31] esther when it came down to it
[1:15:36] esther was the only one that could give
[1:15:40] up all her own ideas
[1:15:42] they all had ideas and no doubt esther
[1:15:45] had some ideas too
[1:15:47] she's human like the rest of them they
[1:15:49] all had ideas on what would be beautiful
[1:15:51] ideas about what would be presentable
[1:15:53] ideas about
[1:15:54] what would be pleasing but when it came
[1:15:57] down to it esther was the only one
[1:16:00] that could give up all her own ideas and
[1:16:02] just submit to what haggai
[1:16:05] had appointed and there's a bride on the
[1:16:08] earth today and she's the only one
[1:16:11] she may have ideas we have ideas we all
[1:16:14] get ideas
[1:16:15] but there's one woman that can give up
[1:16:17] all her own ideas and just take the word
[1:16:21] i say god i believe i'm that one but i
[1:16:24] need your help oh god
[1:16:26] open my eyes show me any area in my life
[1:16:29] lord that that is not righted show me
[1:16:32] wherever i'm taking my own
[1:16:33] idea so that i could surrender that
[1:16:37] so that when you see me you'll see me
[1:16:40] the way
[1:16:41] king ahazera saw esther
[1:16:45] and he loved her above all the other
[1:16:47] virtues
[1:16:49] i want to have that character in me amen
[1:16:53] are we perfect no but the perfect one
[1:16:57] has already saw us as perfect what is he
[1:17:00] looking for character

[1:21:09] amen as we go we can just think on these
[1:21:11] things but
[1:21:14] you know it was it was esther's
[1:21:17] privilege
[1:21:19] to surrender all it was her privilege
[1:21:22] to give up her ideas and all her own
[1:21:25] thoughts and
[1:21:26] just take what haggy i said though she
[1:21:28] may not have
[1:21:29] you know she may not have uh come to
[1:21:33] that conclusion quickly we don't know
[1:21:34] how long it took but
[1:21:36] somewhere along the line she got the
[1:21:37] idea that everything i think could be
[1:21:39] wrong but i know this will be right
[1:21:42] and it became her privilege to surrender
[1:21:44] her idea
[1:21:46] it became her privilege to throw it away
[1:21:49] and after it was all said and done
[1:21:51] when you get to the end of the story i
[1:21:54] don't think she had any regrets
[1:21:56] for laying down her own thinking for
[1:21:58] surrendering everything that she thought
[1:22:00] and just take his word you know i don't
[1:22:04] think
[1:22:05] is it really a sacrifice to give up what
[1:22:08] i think for what the word says
[1:22:10] when we get to the end of the story i
[1:22:11] think we're going to be in the same spot
[1:22:13] it was worth it all there's no regrets i
[1:22:16] didn't lose anything
[1:22:17] i didn't give up anything it was all
[1:22:20] game
