[0:00] And as I said to you, the woman at the
[0:01] well, she initially she said, "Sir, I
[0:05] perceive that they are a prophet,
[0:06] right?" And that was good. That's great.
[0:09] But he talked to her a bit more. Amen.
[0:12] And then she said, "Well, well, when
[0:13] Messiah comes, he's going to tell us
[0:15] these things." Who are you? And when
[0:18] when she thought he was a prophet, she
[0:20] didn't move. Right? But when he when she
[0:22] said, "When Messiah comes, he's going to
[0:24] tell us these things. Who are you?" He
[0:25] said, "I am he." She drops the water pot
[0:27] and she's gone. It changed her. She then
[0:30] gives a report in the city. She doesn't
[0:31] go and say, "I've seen a prophet." She
[0:33] said, "This is Messiah. Come and see."
[0:36] See, it motivated her. And and and Jesus
[0:39] could could rest in that. He's she's
[0:41] caught the revelation. Amen. Because she
[0:44] was elect. He couldn't leave her any
[0:46] sooner. He had to wait until she she
[0:47] caught the the revelation that the man
[0:49] in John nine that he was talking to the
[0:53] uh to the scribes and Pharisees and they
[0:55] asked him, "What sayest there of him
[0:57] that have opened thine eyes?" The
[0:59] Pharisees say, he said, "He's a
[1:00] prophet." Uhhuh. Well, that's a good
[1:02] report. That's how it started. And he
[1:05] says, "Will you also be his disciples?"
[1:08] He was very confident. I love this man.
[1:11] And they said, "We're Moses' disciples.
[1:13] As for this fellow, we know not whence
[1:14] he is." And he goes, "Well, here it is a
[1:16] marvelous thing." You know, he's he's
[1:17] starting to mock them now. You know, he
[1:19] had no fear of them like his parents
[1:21] had. You know, he's like, "Wow, here is
[1:23] a marvelous thing. Ye know not from
[1:24] whence he is, and yet he had opened mine
[1:26] eyes. If this man were not of God, he
[1:28] could do nothing." And they cast him
[1:30] out. But when Jesus heard that they had
[1:33] cast him out, he came and found him
[1:34] again.
[1:37] And when Jesus found him, he asked him,
[1:39] he said, "Dust thou believe on the Son
[1:41] of God?"
[1:43] And he said, "Who is he, Lord?" And he
[1:45] said, "It is he that talkketh with
[1:46] thee." And he said, "Lord, I believe."
[1:50] He was elect. He couldn't leave him just
[1:52] believing as a prophet. He had a good
[1:54] report. He's a prophet. No. He said he
[1:56] had to come to the point where he says,
[1:57] "Actually, who is he, Lord?" Oh, it's
[1:59] him. Okay. And he worshiped him. Amen.
[2:02] Praise the Lord. The two on the road to
[2:03] Emmas. Jesus slips up next to them and
[2:06] he hears the conversation. They're sad
[2:07] and they're talking about and they're
[2:09] saying, he says, "Well, you know what
[2:10] things?" And they say, "Well, if Jesus
[2:11] of Nazareth, you know, he was a prophet,
[2:14] mighty in word and deed that they've got
[2:16] a good report. He's a prophet." But
[2:18] Jesus walks with them and he starts
[2:19] talking to them and he starts breaking
[2:21] the scripture and he says, you know,
[2:22] from the time of Moses and all the
[2:24] prophets, all the things concerning
[2:25] himself and you they must have been
[2:28] thinking, man, we've got to have this
[2:29] guy in our pulpit. We got to bring him
[2:30] back. He's going to he could preach,
[2:32] man, he could preach a great sermon. You
[2:33] know, they still weren't recognizing who
[2:35] he was. So, I got to walk a bit further.
[2:37] He walks a bit further and he tells them
[2:39] what they still didn't recognize him.
[2:41] They walk a bit further. They get to the
[2:42] place where they're staying. And Jesus
[2:44] makes out he's going to go on. He had no
[2:46] intention of going on, but he needed
[2:48] them to ask him to come in. They asked
[2:50] him to come in and then he broke the
[2:51] bread and they recognized that's who he
[2:53] is. Then he disappeared out of their
[2:55] sight. He couldn't disappear out of
[2:57] their sight until they recognized who he
[2:59] was because they were elect. Amen. He
[3:02] can't disappear out of our sight till we
[3:04] catch the revelation of who he is. Amen.
[3:07] It's just uh such a marvelous thing.
[3:10] They were reading between the lines.
