preeminence Among Us Lord we've come to Feast from your hand we've come to glorify your name we've come to hear from you we pray though that as we open your word and look into it I pray you would take and break the bread of Life To Us by your own hand Lord God I am just a vessel there's nothing I can do without you lord but I'm standing here in obedience to you trusting that if I can surrender that you can come by the power of your Holy Spirit and take this vessel and speak through these lips of clay and deliver unto us your Eternal Word but that's what we've come for Lord to commune with you I pray God that you would do the Supernatural part now she would come and you would speak the hearts and lives trusting you we're giving you all of ourselves and surrender in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all this morning certainly wonderful to be here with you amen if you could please take your Bibles while we're standing we'll look into II Corinthians chapter four and I just want to welcome all the visitors that are here today I see several and I said God bless you there's a special visitor gaming brother Ed cater from Newfoundland God bless you he's here with his wife brother Ed and I have had a little bit of Fellowship on the phone but we have never met in person so this is a wonderful day he's from Newfoundland and he was traveling down to Ontario to visit family and he decided to make the extra trip down to see us so God bless you and your wife it's good to have you here also brother Levi and his family is with us again God bless you they're certainly not visitors but they they only get here from time to time so it's good to have you guys as well and I saw brother Arley stutzman over here and Brother Andy Byler God bless both of you it's good to have you in the service and all the other visitors we welcome you and say God bless you and it's good to have you here today amen I want to remind you too brother Emmanuel Sabas was still traveling and so I I was texting with him they're doing well I mean they're still trusting the Lord give him inspiration they go from meeting to meeting still and he's returning home September 11th so he's still got a little bit left in his journey and so I pray you just pray that pray for him pray for his family sister Mimi and the kids that God will continue to strengthen them God's been good to them all but we pray that they come back with wonderful wonderful reports and also I want to remind you that tomorrow brother Ben and sister man is invited the church out for the Labor Day picnic at their place starting at noon so God bless you hopefully we can see you all there and also this afternoon will be the communion and feet Washing Service we'll come back for so God bless you and we can return for that amen let's look at the scripture while we're standing yet in second Corinthians chapter four verse 18. while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal man God bless you as you have your seats amen I love this scripture amen because we are so uh so trained to this life trained to this world trained to the Natural it's everything we've ever known in the natural life we were born into this world we were born into these bodies we were born in this condition amen and as we grow up we see the natural we see the things that around us the things that we can touch and we can feel we can smell it and all of those things but those things are all the temporal but it's the things that are not seen for the things which are are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal so so the scripture Apostle Paul tells us we look not to the things that are seen so all of a sudden when we were not to look at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen amen because the things that are not seen are more real than what's seen and as a Christian there's a greater reality that opens up to us when we're born again by the spirit of God a whole spiritual level opens to us and we begin to have the capacity to move beyond the scene into the Unseen amen for our whole Christian life amen has to do with the Unseen realities amen so I want to look at while we're together let's look at a couple scriptures let's go to First Timothy together First Timothy chapter one and this inspiration came from the preaching on Wednesday night amen I just I was struck as I was done preaching with that with this thought that I want to share with you today and and become so real and in fact the title is the invisible is the real so the invisible is the real if you want to know what real is the invisible is the real and and you know just because something's invisible doesn't mean it doesn't exist the fact that we call it invisible isn't evidence that it exists because if it doesn't exist it can't be invisible I hope that makes sense if I say amen I have something but it's invisible that there's a substance behind that the whole term invisible means something that substance that can't be seen so the fact that we call it invisible means it's real it's a substance it's there we just can't see it amen and let's look at First Timothy 1 17 to show this point it says now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God the honor and Glory forever and ever God is invisible is he real is he substance I venture to say that the invisible God is the only real substance every other substance amen was another substance created for an expression of what was really real but the most real that you can get is all the way back to the original when God Elohim dwelt alone with his thoughts that is the core of real that is the most real that is the originator of real you can get no more real than that real and it's completely invisible totally untangible to anything that we understand to be tangible in this life but that is actually the core of real and everything else amen is is another created reality to express this invisible reality but if you want the real you've got to go back to the Core amen so let's look at Hebrews chapter 12. this is very familiar and say I appreciated the specials very much today man God was good to grant us that and one of those refers to this scripture here Hebrews chapter 12 verse 18. I'd like to begin reading this is something that brother Ben siebel dealt with the last few times he preached but in verse 18 He says for you are not come to the mount that might be touched that burn with fire nor into Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it should be stoned or thrust through with a dark and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but you are coming to Mount Zion so you haven't come to that tangible physical Mountain that you could see that you could feel the earthquake that you could see the lightning and fire and hear the thunder and the voice you have not come to that uh I'd say that reality but you have come to an invisible reality this is what Paul's telling us amen Paul the Apostle is is taking he's taking the Believers beyond the tangible and moving in them to the supernatural into the Unseen amen so you are coming to Mount Zion into the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels so you are come to a place amen he's not saying uh oh he he you're actually brought amen through this new birth to this place this is now a reality to you amen you have come to Mount Zion Amen to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem you say I want to go to the Heavenly Jerusalem Paul says you've come to it it's unseen it's an unseen reality amen and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel see that you refuse not him that speaketh for they escape not whom refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven so there's another voice thundering amen there's another thundering voice Amen in this day not sounding from Earth but sounding from heaven praise God and it's going to take a different set of ears to hear this one verse 27 I'm sorry yeah and this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain now there's come a shaking and the voice in the last day has sounded a thundering and a shaking and that shaking is to remove all things that are temporal all things that are made so that that which is not cannot be shaken what will remain what will remain that which is not made that which is invisible that which is eternal that which is really real so it says we've come to this heavenly Jerusalem if we turn back to Hebrews chapter 11 we'll go back one chapter Hebrews chapter 11 verse 8. speaking of Abraham it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourn in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker was gone praise God he went out wondering amen Abraham never established himself in the land he was looking for something he was looking for something that was real to him amen he wasn't looking for something because it wasn't real amen he wasn't following an imagination but he was looking for something with reality to it he was looking for a city that hath foundations that's not talking about natural foundations where you dig down and plant the stone amen this thing has foundations means it's solidly planted unmovable unshakable it has a foundation and that Foundation is God amen so he was looking for something secure something sure amen something steadfast not anything he could establish on the earth because anything he could establish would be temporal anything he could build would fade away but he was wondering living in tense dwelling with The Heirs of Promise looking for what looking for a city that has foundations whose Builder and maker is gone what city was God building amen it was an invisible City there's a Heavenly Jerusalem the Apostle Paul says in Galatians 4 but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all so now this city amen that that Abraham was looking for Paul says it's your mother it's your mother is that City your mother did you come from the Heavenly Jerusalem absolutely amen it's a reality it's a reality to me because I'm born from there it's a reality to me because I come from there that's the city that I'm looking for that's my origin that's my birthplace amen that's why that's why we say when we leave this world where do we want to go we want to go home how many says that I want to go home if you say you want to go home amen you testify that this is not your home you testify you're just a pilgrim and a stranger I mean that you have an origin from somewhere else that's your home it's invisible but it's real and as through the New Birth when you become a Christian it became real to you before this was real amen but the higher we climb in Christ this becomes less real this becomes less real that becomes the real and the more we can make the shift and move from all of this tangible products becoming real to the Unseen becoming the real amen the less the life is going to have an effect in us to keep us from the promise amen we figure you know so much of what we're hindered by are things that are temporal things that will fade away things that will change how many times we're hampered and we're we're held back and we're held down amen emotionally by all these troubles and trials and misunderstandings and and and and wrongdoings and even our own wrongdoings we have all of these things that are such a hinder to us and hamper us amen but they are all temporal it is all temporal it'll all fade away I mean the circumstance that tripped you up so much a year from now will just be a memory it won't even be a reality that's affecting you anymore it only affected you then and God was using it for your growth anyhow and you moved to another place amen and that thing's no longer affecting you because it was temporal but in the day that we were suffering under that trial it was the greatest barrier in our life the most difficult thing we were facing and we were hampered and hindered by something temporal that was going to change and if we can begin to see our lives this way that these things we Face are going to change these circumstances are going to change these things that we deal with they are temporal even if they last a lifetime that's temporal because a lifetime to man is but a vapor it's been a brief moment of Speck in the eternities and we came from eternity we go back to Eternity we will dwell forever in eternity what is 70 80 90 years anyways so if it lasts my Earthly lifetime it hardly lasted at all it was temporal but we've got to move Beyond these things into the real reality so that they're not chains about our feet and handcuffs on our hands amen the BAM says in the invisible union he makes a statement referring to what we just read about Abraham looking for the city which happens to be my mother dear God we sit solemnly now a Thanksgiving Day it really is Lord I'm Grateful Lord to be living in this day this is the greatest day Paul the Apostle long to see this day the Great Men of old long to see it the prophets long to see it they looked for this day Abraham looked for this day for he sought for a city whose Builder and maker was God it hangs right above us tonight what what what Abraham was looking for is hanging right over you just reach up and touch it amen the brother Brandon believe it was there absolutely did he declare it was there did your eyes declare it was there no but there's another Sense on the inside that surpasses the ten senses that I'm hindered by in my body and it's the sense of Faith which is the super sense and it's the one I need to touch this unseen reality amen because all my other senses have to do with my Earthly journey and have to do with the temporal but there's another sense that can go beyond the temporal into the unseen reality and that's the sense of faith praise God so let's go back to uh verse one Hebrews 11 verse 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so now Faith is a substance that means faith is real faith is not an emotion faith is not a thought faith is is not a figment of our imagination faith is a substance and it's more substance than the thoughts that pass through your mind that are temporal the thoughts of fear and anxiety they're temporal amen they fade away even thoughts of excitement and enthusiasm they fade away all of these emotions are so temporal you can have emotional whiplashing man you can go from the highest height to the lowest lows in the matter of seconds I mean you you can be having the perfect day in one phone call one text message one comment from somebody can take you from the highest to the absolute lowest it's absolutely temporal that's these emotions it's in the spirit realm amen these these these uh uh these senses in the outside realm to see touch feel smell taste and hear amen they they're all temporal amen they're only for a moment the moment that smells there the moment that site's there it's all temporal it fades away amen and it's all Del it's all dealing with the temporal but there's one super sense that God has given his children and that is the super sense of faith that can go beyond all of that amen and you can have the worst day of the worst news you can feel utterly depressed frightened scared with anxiety worry all of these things can come on but a super sense can go beyond the temporal and say but my God has made a promise in his word he'll never leave me nor forsake me the supersense can override all these senses so the invisible is the real so now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen what's my evidence not something I see we have so tried to come up with evidences for being children of God that are tangible because that's the only world we understand we want proofs we want we want to be able to show something or have something that declares uh declares and proves that I'm a Child of God Amen but this faith is the substance of things so forth it is the evidence of the Unseen World what evidence do you want the only evidence that is real and that is faith praise God and that's a gift of God we thank God for that for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear I love this scripture I want to spend just a moment on it by faith we understand that the world's refrained by the word of God so God even uh framed the world through faith his own faith by the word he spoke the word and had to believe his own word so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so God did not take the visible tangible world and make a visible tangible world he made everything we see out of things that don't appear let's just think about that for a moment everything we see in creation was made of things that do not appear so which came first the things that do not appear which means they were substance there is an unseen substance there's something and don't ask me to describe it I don't know how to describe it but there's some unseen something that does not appear and God took that substance and made this tangible world out of that substance that came first that's more real than this because this was made from that so everything that appears was made from that which does not appear so that which does not appear preceded this and is more real than this so it was a reality a substance not an imagination not emotion not a thought an emotion not a thought I mean we have to go beyond the whole religious realm who who are or the the Realms of religion that are dealing with thoughts and they're dealing with theories and they're dealing with all of these things this isn't a thought this isn't a theory amen God's not a theory amen religion isn't a way of thinking it's an absolute substance that superseded this substance that this substance was made from so we have to stop dealing with God as is he's an imagination or he's a thought or he's a concept he's not a concept he's not a religious concept he's also not a Feeling he's not a theory he's not an idea he is the only real reality praise God brother Ben said intellectual conceptions is all right you remember when the eye looks upon it the devil uses your eye and the Garden of Eden proved that the devil chose the head of man to work in but God chooses his heart the devil shows him with his eye something he can see and he says seeing is believing but when God comes to a man he comes to his heart and he lets him believe things by his heart through faith that his eyes does not see for the scripture sayeth that the faith is the substance of the things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen praise God let's turn to John chapter 20. John chapter 20. John 20 and 26 and after eight days again his disciples were within this is after the resurrection and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said Peace be unto you then said he to Thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hands and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and Thomas answered and said unto him my Lord and my God Jesus saith unto him Thomas because thou has seen me thou has believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed Thomas needed to see something Thomas declared I won't believe it until I can take my finger and thrust it into the nail print and take my hand and thrust it and decide Thomas needed to see Something to Believe In amen and Jesus was good to Thomas and that he would give Thomas that opportunity but he says but blessed there's a blessing that comes to those who don't see but believe amen you've never had the opportunity Thomas had you didn't even have the opportunity that they had in that room that day amen when Jesus resurrected and entered into the room you weren't there by the Sea of Tiberius you weren't there to see him caught up with clouds into heaven you haven't had that opportunity but praise God you have the same Faith they have and can believe just as much as they believe without seeing because it's a blessing for us to believe without seeing amen so we're always wanting to see something remember but but he says the blessed is those who can believe without seeing amen praise God and don't get me wrong I still want to see something please don't get me wrong but the blessing is faith let's go to First Peter chapter one you know the Bible proves that the blessing is faith because how many saw Jesus Christ saw him saw the Miracles saw the lame walk but how many believed he was the Messiah the blessing is faith not just seeing huh how much did Judas see but yet he couldn't believe so the blessing is not seen the bless the greater blessing is believing I mean how many Saw God in this day us all the son of man amen working through a son of man and absolutely declaring himself by the sign of the Messiah how many people saw it many people saw it how many people believed how did you believe God gave it to you to believe there was a sea Gene of God that could say that ain't nothing but the truth how did the how how did the woman who broke the alabaster box how did she recognize how did she see why did she know what to do amen it wasn't through training it was through faith how did the woman of Samaria how did she know how did blind Bartimaeus know how did they all blind Barn a man who was blind he could see Jesus he could see who he was amen but when those with open eyes were looking right at him and couldn't see who he was but the blind man was declaring amen thou son of David have mercy on me he knew this was the Messiah amen the Unseen is the reality amen first Peter chapter one verse 6. said wherein you greatly rejoiced them now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold Temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found into the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love and whom though now you see him not ye yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls amen Paul now is writing to the Gentiles they didn't have the opportunity he had he saw Jesus but Judas also saw Jesus so Peter recognized that it is by faith by grace now he says now you have not seen you love you love you haven't seen him but you love him those who saw him couldn't love him but you didn't see him and you love him though you have not seen him not seen him not yet believing you rejoice with joy we have joy unspeakable and rejoicing and what in the unseen reality what brings us joy the Unseen what Thrills our heart amen what what gives us such Joy what gives us such peace what gives us exhilaration and exuberance and excitement amen is not something you can take out and show to somebody else the thing that Thrills our soul is that which can't be seen praise God who is it we love and adore the one that this Earth can't see but we can see him Jesus says the world won't see me but you'll see me and the disciples were confused by this seeing because they still only understand carnal they were seeing him then and they thought they were going to continue to go on seeing him when the comforter came but when the comforter comes you're not going to see me I mean the world won't see me but you'll see me right now the world can see me and you can see me but there's coming a day the world can't see me but you can see me and they asked they asked a very reasonable question amen do you agree it was a reasonable question when they said how is it that we'll see you and the world won't see you like how's that going to happen amen that's a reasonable question that's why we don't rely on reasoning because reasoning takes is absolutely the wrong direction that was an extremely reasonable question to ask but it took him in the absolute wrong direction because this isn't going to be a physical seeing this is going to be a spiritual seeing it says now in questions and answers from 59 the prophet says the Christian looks at things that he does not see with his eyes for we look at the Unseen how do you look at it with your inside eyes you know if you're a child of God with a gene of God inside of you you've got inside eyes and you've got inside ears amen you see it by faith and now to prove that the whole Christian armor is made up of unseen qualities what is a Christian armor somebody says seeing is believing that person would never be a Christian because the armor of the Christian is made up of this love did you ever see it you've seen it in action but you never seen love if you can pull your part of Love out and let me see what it looks like see look love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness faithfulness uh faithfulness gentleness the whole Christian armor is unseen with the natural eye but it is understood by the heart and the message awaking Jesus is now I think that's marvelous and that gives illiterate people like me a chance everybody to believe it because we hear it and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God then we accept that and believe that and upon the basis of our faith in that we are saved healed and whatever more we're drawn we draw from God comes from an unseen resource whatever we're drawing is coming from an unseen resource and we tap into it by faith I'm going to ask you about this unseen resource just because it's unseen doesn't mean it's not real what is this unseen resource it was the same resource that this world was made by because what the scene was made of that which does not appear it's an unseen resource amen but that unseen resource had enough reality had enough tangibility had enough substance that it could make this world the universe the galaxies the stars as far as you can go it made all of that substance out of one a greater substance that was the unseen reality and it's this unseen resource we can tap into now and if it can create a universe can it heal your body if it can create a universe can it deliver you if you can create a universe could he answer your questions how do I get into this same resource that God used to create this world Amen you get there by faith in the word of God and God created this by faith in his own word you get to the Unseen resource and pull out of the bank of resources they're not imaginations they're substance and we pull that substance down by faith amen he goes on in the same court he says Christians the whole armor of Christianity is faith everything that we have is unseen the only things that's real is unseen I like that the only thing that's real is unseen we have our cars we have our houses we have but it's not real you say brother Chad it's real I'll say it this way it's real in a way but in comparison to real it's not real do you understand it's like if you live give a little girl a dolly that's her dolly she becomes a mother to that Dolly that's real to her but is it real in comparison to a live baby that she no it's not it it's real but it's not real there's a greater reality that this reality is reflecting a little girl with a desire to be a mama holding a babies reflecting a greater reality but it's a reflection it's a lower form there's a greater reality yet that this reality came from amen and the whole the whole uh uh the whole concept we have the whole desire to worship God the whole desire to love God and worship God and come together in Fellowship it's reflecting a greater reality yet amen some place that we came from some place we're going to another dimension all together and this is just reflecting that back on the Earth amen and the message look brother remember says now remember the whole Christian armor is Supernatural if you're a Christian you say seeing is believing you can never be a Christian if you believe that oh let's drive this home down now amen you have to prove it to me if I have to prove it to you you can never be a Christian if you say seeing is believing seeing is believing amen seeing is not believing because they saw and didn't believe so I mean praise God you say singers believe me you can never be a Christian if you believe that your faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you cannot be a Christian and have to see the thing the whole armor of God is Supernatural love joy peace Faith long suffering goodness meekness gentleness and the Holy Ghost is all unseen and the Christian doesn't look to what he sees with his eyes he looks to what he sees with his faith and his faith can only be based upon one thing that's the word so glad he said that amen we can have people try to get us to have faith in all kinds of things but we can only really have faith in one thing and that's the word amen praise God in the message looking at the Unseen brother bear says now if you want to know there was something happened in the building just then a healing it's a lady sitting here right out here in the audience kind of a heavyset lady she's got her hands up and her eyes closed to pray she's got a bowel trouble and a back trouble and she's praying for God to heal her she's sitting right there wearing glasses and a dark suit on right at the end of this row you that's got your hands you there that's got your hands up that's what was wrong with you if that's right raise your hands like that I don't know you do I no sir we're strangers go home now you touch the border of His Garment you touched him because I'm 20 feet from you but you touched him the high priest that could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities brother Madam with a gift that God gave him amen that gift was not healing that woman amen that gift was declaring back to her what just happened to her and she had to raise her hand to testify that that's what happened to her amen and she may not have understood what happened but brother Madam understood what happened she had touched to him of the high priest Karma she had touched him amen and and brothers trying to get the people to see it's not me I'm 20 feet from you it's not touching me amen you have to go beyond this vessel this Tabernacle and you've got to go to the high priest and you've got to touch him and if you can touch him you can be made every bit whole we see this in Luke chapter eight I want to read this scripture in Luke chapter 8. Luke chapter 8 is when this woman with the blood issue touches the hymn of Jesus garment brother Ben refers to this so many times I'm going to read from chapter 8 and Luke verse 43. and the woman having an issue of blood 12 years which had spent all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood staunched and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter and they that were with him said Master the multitude thronged thee and press thee and sayest thou who touched me and Jesus said somebody hath touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me such an interesting scripture brother remember refers to it when he says Peter said Peter rebuked him he said in other words he'd say like this Lord what are you talking about who touched you they're all climbing over one another to touch you as I said they all strong the impress thee is what what Peter said he says so he's rebuking Jesus and he's saying what do you mean by that they're all trying to touch you they're all pressing in to touch you he said but I perceive that I've gotten weak virtues gone from me somebody touched him with a different kind of a touch oh praise God you realize that her touch may have manifested in physical form when she reached out and touched the hymn of her garment but others were touching him remember the soldiers were touching him when they stripped him and they beat him and they weren't healed they weren't delivered they didn't have Supernatural experiences there was many guards that were capturing him that touched him he had been touched by many that day they were all thronging and pressing him and touching him amen but he never stopped and said somebody touched me although he was being touched so you see the physical act of her touch amen wasn't the touch it was the representation of the touch it was a physical expression of the touch but the real touch was a faith touch because she knew in her heart she believed in her heart if I can but Touch the Hem of His Garment I can be made every bit whole the touch that touched him was the touch of faith not the physical touch [Music] the physical touch was the manifestation of her touch of faith it was her faith being expressed because she believed if I touched him of His Garment others touched and touched for whatever reason they touched amen but she touched because of her faith amen and when she touched him that way by faith he stopped in his tracks with the crowd thronging and pressing upon him and he says who touched me so much so that Peter and the other disciples are bewildered at the statement but he knew strength left me somebody touched me in a different way oh I say God give us Faith to reach out and touch him amen touch him today in his Supernatural spiritual way may there be a something come alive inside of us in our heart that we realize if I can just by faith reach up and touch him amen you may not have to move your hands you may not have to move your mouth but if your heart can move your faith into action and you can reach out in the spiritual realm and grab a hold of the high priest amen the touch to him of His Garment you can be made every bit whole you can touch him the same way she touched him praise God amen going to the greater reality amen brother Branham came and he he at the end of his ministry he he started nailing down uh this concept of eleazer fetching a bride and a bride calling out a bride for Christ and then he comes into the union he preaches proving his word and in there he tells us that the marriage is now that the union is taking place now the marriage is now and and he comes in the message he preaches the invisible Union of the bride of Christ and he makes this statement and here said in the invisible Union of the church the bride to Christ there's an invisible Union that is going on right now between the bride of Christ and Jesus Christ there is a marriage that is taking place amen and I want to ask you what did you see in that marriage amen what were the decorations like amen what were the decorations like amen what was the what were the Motions amen not everybody got married at the same time but if you've come into this Union with your bridegroom with Jesus Christ then you've come into an invisible Union with Christ amen and there's nothing that you can show there's no evidence that you have you can show evidences amen you can show the outworkings of it but you can't show that Union it's invisible and takes place in The Invisible Realm amen I mean Brother Bear comes down he he's he's he's he's playing the part of Eliezer from the Old Testament and he's here he's a forerunner to Christ he's a forerunner to the second coming he's here declaring the appearing of the Lord declaring that the presence of the Lord is here he's here to preach the opening of the seals showing that the bridegroom is now present what's the bridegroom the revealed word showing that the lamb took the book and opened the seals showing the presence of the bridegroom here for a union he's here to bring the two together he's here to unite the body and the head together so he's doing this in his ministry and he comes to proving his word and he begins to declare that the marriage is now it's taking place now and you go back and you say when was it what ceremony did he say what words when did Brother Branham what point did he unite these two things together you can't go back and say that was the moment that was the sentence that was it amen it was he was preaching Christ and presenting Christ and there was somebody out there that was able to get a hold of Christ and say I want to be in Union with him and there was a marriage that was taking place and a marriage has been taking place since and that should be the most real thing to us that is listen that is if you're married that Union is more real than your physical Union with your spouse your physical Union with your spouse is only a a dollar reflection of this this is the thing that is most real this is the real reality of Our Lives there's a certain reality to our lives there's a reality that we have a job reality we go to work there's a reality we have a house there's a reality we have a family of friends we have we have certain things we do that's all a reality amen but there's a greater reality above all of that and beyond all of that and that greater reality needs to be the reality of Our Lives the Unseen Union between me and Christ amen it should be reflected in my life absolutely but the the actual Union takes place in my soul and I can't take it out and show it to you I've received it by faith I believe it by faith I declare by the faith is the substance of that Union for me faith is the evidence of that Union for me Amen in in the Samaritan Church age out of the church age book Prophet begins to teach and he says what watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God what a statement who in the world has the courage to even make a statement like that only somebody who understands he understands what he's talking about he knows the great Elohim the self-existent one he was there alone nothing else was there as far as I don't even want to say that because it's not that's not even technically true but anything that you would see as tangible even as light dust molecules things in the universe microbes or organisms or nothing was there all of that was created later he dwelt alone with his thoughts so that means before there was manifested light God was with his thoughts let's keep reading and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts oh my goodness and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all of his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real I love this the prophet says the bride was already in his mind she was existing in his thoughts back before he began to create even the Heavenly realm back before he even created the pillar of Fire before there was anything to declare or to express before anything that was made in the heavens or in the earth before any of that he was alone with his thoughts and those thoughts are his attributes we will learn this as we go and and and those attributes were his family and in his mind and his thoughts he had his bride amen and that makes his bride those in the bride existed in his thoughts amen before there was anything else when there was only the originator of real the only true real the real real the only real real the real that all other real comes from in there amen if you're a son or daughter of God you were there then amen so you transcend everything all the Unseen you can go beyond all of that [Music] you say I want to go to heaven you were before heaven was created amen as a thought in the mind of God be we want to go to a place we want to go to heaven we want to escape this that's just moving into another dimension another reality another created sphere amen but before he created that sphere you were real you existed real in his thoughts and when we say you listen I'm not talking about your flesh your eyebrows your hair I'm not talking about all of that God had a thought an identity that he was going to bring flesh into and show that but it's the sieging the attribute the portion of God word life eternal life light whatever you want to call it that was to be you that was to be a portion of God expressed as you and that true reality of you was there before there was anything else amen oh I want to read this again thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real listen we gotta Hammer that down because as human beings amen my thoughts are not real I have thoughts that never materialize I have thoughts that are proven wrong I have thoughts that I have to retract is that right but God's not like me he doesn't have a fallen mind so when we start talking about the thoughts of God Amen we've got to break out of the natural and move beyond the limitations of our mind and recognize a perfect mind that when he thought of himself it was a perfect thought it was an eternal thought he was thinking of himself amen what is the Eternal thought of God it's his eternal thought about himself how he will Express himself his attributes the fullness of him being expressed as a family God thought that before the foundation of the world and you were part of that thought because you were intended to be part of that expression so I know I mean when we start dealing with this we're dealing with things that are so far removed from the things we've known all of our life that only only faith is going to allow us to penetrate beyond our carnal mind beyond all of our experiences beyond the natural that we've been locked into and pierced beyond all of that and see that this is absolutely nothing but the truth and the only real real there is so I want to say the statement again thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real I want to make this other statement from the paragraph before the bride was already in his mind she was existing in his thoughts sometimes I we've had the tendency to almost downplay that like I was there before but not only in his thoughts is there anything more real than his thoughts is there any existence more real than his thoughts so don't say that was only in his thoughts say that was already in his thoughts that's where everything originated from that makes it more real than any other expression that is the real expression that's the genuine that's the first that's I hope you see what I'm saying we can't say well you know I existed before I was in heaven before I have representation in him well that was only as a thought my goodness you want anything more than that I mean only as a thought a genuine thought of God an attribute of God God thinking of himself God himself I was there real existing in his thoughts and you say a statement like only in his thinking only is thinking where else do you want to originate do you want to pop out somewhere else down the line no I want to originate right there and if I originate there no matter where I pop out down the line it goes right back to my original existence in the mind of God so you got to go so far beyond this carnal so far beyond the tangible so far beyond Realms and dimensions because Realms and dimensions were created to express God's thoughts I'm telling you this message is so deep no earthly man could have preached this but it's so simple it's not complicated but when you try to understand it by carnality it just doesn't add up because I only know matter space and time I only know here and there I only know now and then but there was a time that I knew before that and there's something inside of me that still knows what I knew before that word attribute of thought of God a c Gene a portion so many ways to describe it but it links back to the same thing amen that is the unseen reality that must be our reality listen if this unseen reality becomes real To Us by a gift of faith then the trials of Life they're really I I don't want to trivialize anything but really they're nothing now I don't want to trivialize I've been through some hard times listen I've been through some times where I've wept I've wept into my pillow I've had sleepless nights real trials real hard times that I absolutely thought that I was physically dying there's times that I thought my mind my mind was actually being twisted and broken apart inside my head the pressure was so great it was so intense I would there are times when death would have been a release so I don't want to trivialize it and say it's nothing and this Dimension it's the most horrible thing you can go through but when we step away and look at the unseen reality of God it's actually nothing it's temporal it's not the real it will fade away the trial will fade away the this Earthly existence will fade away everything will fade away amen but that which originated and existed in the mind of God before the foundation of the world it will never fade away I want that to be my reality I want that I want all my perspective to be built off that reality and if I can get all my perspective built off that reality then the trial then you talk about overcoming trials it's not a strain to overcome trials it's a revelation that overcomes tries you can fly above it because you're an eagle but you say I'm an eagle that can't cause you to Fly Above It just the word eagle you say I'm an eagle I'm a Child of God saying the words will not bring you above your trial I mean I know I've said them I made bold claims and proclamations and declared who I was and I wasn't lying I believed it but the thing that'll actually lift you up is the revelation of who you really are and who you've always meant been meant to be then it puts everything else in perspective and it brings everything else a little lower praise God so I'm gonna I'm still haven't finished my sentence thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint who is drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal part of God oh can we lock down on that listen yeah we've got to stay tuned in to what the prophet's saying because we know other quotes right but let's stay tuned in for just a minute these thoughts of God they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint who has a plan and that plan will someday translate in the substance or form that's not this kind of thought because we know other quotes and because we have a human existence we think well God thought of me he took a picture of me for the foundation the world and he thought of me and now he's bringing me into substance no you were already substance because the thoughts of God are substance they are real they are Eternal they are substance it's not like oh God had a thought of me and one day he'll make me real when he thought of you you were real that was real this is real in another dimension but it's a less real than not real So when you say one day I mean one day God knew that I would come and he would sow me into the layout of seeing age and I would come for them that's all true but that's only speaking of this outer man amen but the the inner a sieging of God has always been real always been substance amen not waiting to become substance has always been substance so it's not like a man with a blueprint when God sitting back with his thoughts he's not drawing out a plan and then working that plan and one day what he thought that attribute will one day become substance no it was already substance and he was declaring how this substance will be made manifest not become substance and in order to make it manifest he brings it into another substance an Earthly substance a spiritual substance whatever substance amen but the real genuine substance is God is the thought is the attribute is the gene praise God I don't know about you but this is the way I have to start thinking in Ephesians he says Paul says and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ there's a fellowship of this mystery and this word Fellowship is not just simply like Fellowship like we know that's also but but it also means community there's been a whole community of this mystery what is that Community the family of God there's a fellowship of this mystery which God had hid in him what is that mystery that God had hid brother Branham tells us in Christ The Mystery of God there was one goal one plan one great mystery it's Revelation 10 7 The Mystery of God Amen that was what's to be finished in our day in the mystery of God is how God will Express himself Amen in all the Bible characters and all the Bible has been expressing this but Paul the Apostle his ministry was to try to make all men see what is the fellowship of this mystery that God had hid within himself listen you're part of that mystery that God had hid in his back part of his mind from before the foundation of the world and it wasn't a thought like our thought it was substance it was a reality you say was it a living reality is there any other life but God it was a living reality because God is life the source of life he he is life and brother Branham comes on in the Samaritan Church age and he says we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to Quicken amen what's being quicker than you something you cannot see you cannot take out the seed of God and you can't take it in your hand you can't find it in an x-ray brother Gardner can't find it in any of his devices it's invisible it's unseen but it is the greatest reality of my life it is the real part of me it is the really real real me it is what God really meant to be me it's the expression of God that he wanted to come in this expression of me I don't know how to say it right and make it right it's God but it's me it's me expressing God it's a portion of God to be me I don't know the right way to say it all I know is it's the truth and there's a faith there's a faith substance that tells me it's there I can't show it to you amen you can say well you can show evidences there's all kind of evidences there's there's fruits of the spirit there's a there's an overcoming life but there's times that I can show you false evidence and I hate that that's so like I stand here in a reproach saying that but if you followed me around close enough you would find there's times that I speak to you evidence of something else but that evidence is not the reality the reality is what's in my soul that's the reality you know there's people that can show you a true evidence and they're false there's people who can show you a false evidence in the truth what's real is God so we did not become seed when we were born again that seeking of God was already laying there we're only reborn because the spirit of God came in contact with that seed and the two parts of the Chinese ticket came back together for Redemption they were together before they were torn and separated but when they come back together that's Redemption and non-seed there was nothing to Quicken it's amazing because Brother Bear makes some statements that are I mean if you think of his day I can think of being raised in the Pentecostal church so I know all my life what the teaching was and I can reflect back and think of what it was like in his day when he would make a statement like the baptism of the Holy Ghost has nothing to do with it you can have the baptism Holy Ghost every day of your life and die and go to hell and listen the the when I was growing up a boy that was blasphemy that was contrary to scripture blasphemy all these other things because of the way it was taught but brother random showing that that the anointing of God the spirit of God can fall it can fall on wheat and tears it can fall on human beings and they can they can feel it they can even express the anointing in the spirit Realm there can be expressions of that anointing falling upon them and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and it could be a true baptism a holy ghost upon the spirit amen but there if there's no seat there it never goes any deeper because there's nothing deeper for it to contact it's just in the spirit realm and we know this Spirit realm has fallen the spirit will go and be no more someday but there's got to be something real that has to come in contact with not something temporal so the spirit of God's got to move down past the spirit realm into the soul and if there is a portion of God if there's a matching part of the Chinese ticket laying in there then all of a sudden it makes contact and it Springs to life reality finds reality the real touches the real remember says what is the new birth say what brother and what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that sounds so simple to say but that's an absolutely deep statement now you joined a church you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place is Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon what is the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you know there's so many things that we do that are right but they're not exactly it and I know I I that's probably a very confusing statement but we come to church we ought to come to church as part of the word I mean even the life of God would draw us to come to church to be in Fellowship to hear the word to fulfill the word and obey the word but coming the church is not it it's the life on the inside that's it that life on the inside brings a manifestation of fulfilling the word and coming to church and being in fellowship and and and and all the things that we're told to do listen kneeling down and praying is not it either because the Pharisees prayed they prayed for show they made long prayers on the corners of the streets to be seen of men they prayed but it wasn't just the act of praying that was it it's when there was something on the inside that could pray I hope you understand what I'm saying there's a lot of things we can do that are right to do but they're still not it we can order our lives and conduct Our Lives according to the word and listen that can be taught I mean I hope that doesn't discourage anybody or sound wrong but that can be taught the Pharisees were teaching it Paul claims to have come to that place he was taught in the school of Gamaliel he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees as touching the law blameless but he wasn't yet born again he had the seed but it hadn't been quickened to life yet oh praise God help me in The Invisible Union brother bear says well you separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you were born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life The Germ that was in you at the beginning found you explain that to me but I said I have no idea how to explain that to you I've experienced it something found me and where did it find me it found me in me in me was something amen that was laying there waiting to be expressed in a fuller measure and it had to come in contact with the counterpart the life had to come to life word come to word Eagle to Eagle you understand all of this but when I come in contact with the reality because only the real could bring the real to quickening life the false couldn't do it only the real because it was real so it had to be genuine life come to genuine life because it wasn't substitute life this is why the the real Union is the invisible Union the real Union is the invisible Union why is the real Union the invisible Union because in the origin it was invisible and in the mind of God it was invisible in the origin it's visible and now expressed in this life it's back to Invisible again what is it it's a supernatural a spiritual connection amen when life comes to life what was there amen is coming back together here and only the original life only the original word only the real real can bring real to quickening life that's why it had to be the word for your day whatever day you fell in it had to be the word for your day that brought quickening power to the seed amen because it had to be something that was real and original to bring something in you that was real and dormant to quickening life The Substitute couldn't do it the only the real could amen praise God let's go to John chapter 3. I want to read a few scriptures here John chapter 3. and verse 5. this is Jesus speaking with Nicodemus in John 3 verse 5. Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and a spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born in the flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but cast not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit listen I was born of the spirit the individual is born in the spirit he says is Like the Wind the wind is what he says um the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou Hearst the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth everybody is born in the spirit is like this wind you've blown into this dimension nobody can see you I hope that doesn't stumble you if it does I have some quotes we'll read in a minute you have blown in you have moved like the Holy Spirit like the wind you have moved into this dimension what what you were talking about the real real real the seed the attribute the gene the life the light has moved into this life it's been born again and quickened alive and it's moving through this life and he says you can even see the effect of it can you see the effect of the Wind yeah see them move dust and blow dust and move Leaf you've seen the effective wind but you've never seen wind sometimes when you see the effect of when you said look at that wind you never saw the wind you saw the effective win you can see a cloud being pushed by wind to this guy and look at that wind look how windy it is it's windy but you didn't see the wind and in this life he that's born in the spirit is like the wind amen you've blown into this life you're blowing through this life there can be an effect there can be a shaking of the leaves on your tree but nobody has seen you because you are invisible [Music] because before you were ever brought into another substance you were the original invisible substance before there was light even you were there praise God that's why this bride the children of God are a mystery they are a mystery amen brother Ben says in communion the last recorded sermon we have he says what was it there was another William Branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there now what he's talking about he's talking about the Real hymn the genuine hymn he calls it another William Branham I mean that's that's a way of expressing his thought another William Branham a spot of eternal life down there the genes of God the word of God that was placed there so where was the word it was in you that's right that's why the word had to come to you because the word was in you a spot of eternal life a gene of God a portion of word that was placed there Amen in the message things that are to be says this old Earthly Tabernacle here you know what it is this body is like an old coat that you wear a coat that you once wear but now you have one so much better you don't use it anymore what do you do you hang it in the closet for you've got one better you've got a better coat it's more up to date than the one you used to wear that's worn out what it is that garment you are the you are the inside of that there that garment only done one it bore your image but you don't need it anymore now you've hung it up it's a rag and that's the way this old body is it's bore the image of the Heavenly yet it is not you you are on the inside of that body all this helps me so much this is why when when when you get tripped up and you stumble and you fall and you fail Amen brother Bama says you're going to make mistakes you're going to make lots of mistakes remember I said there's traps set for you and you're going to fall into them so he said you're going to fall into them but this is not me this is only a tabernacle of the Earth which is a substance that was made by substance that doesn't appear that's what this earth is made of he made it of things that don't appear and now a portion of this Earth that was made of things that don't appear was brought together to make this body that I live in but it's not me it's a body I live in is it expressing me yes do you say this is uh my hands they are my I can say they're my hands is that a wrong statement no these are my hands but they say this body's not me this body is not the real me and cannot fully Express me that's why so many times in our worship we feel so limited I don't know about you but when you really want to worship God and talk to God and God draws near and you feel his presence and it feels like your heart will just explode you realize you're caged down by this flesh that I wish I had a flesh could express what's in my heart it's not me it's not you you're on the inside of that body you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside come into subjection because the inside is pulling it see bringing in line with the word of God you're inside you yourself your being this body is just an old coat and someday that will what will you do with it for it was only in the Garment for a while that is like the Earthly garment this body your real body your real self is on the inside of this old coat amen you mean there's a body down here yeah there's a soul brother Ben said there's three parts to you you're three persons one of those is a soul amen that Soul that's been regenerated by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and come alive and sprung the life the gene that's alive in your soul that's really you amen so this body is just an old coat and someday what will you do with it there's only a garment for a while like this Earthly garment the body your real body your your real self is on the inside of this old coat that you call William Branham or Susie Jones or whoever it is see someday it will hang in the earth of Earth's Hall of memory you'll put it out yonder in the grave and somebody will put a tombstone up here lies Reverend so and so or John so and so or so and so and it'll lie there a memorial of you the people just seen you in this and what you was your real you was on the inside of that but the old coat itself just bore the image of the heavenly so when I say when you're born again you're like the wind no one's ever seen you they haven't ever seen you they've only seen this outside vessel that declares you the real you is invisible amen the message shalom and now he says as we die like in the physical body as we are now we are separated from one another but it's really this body is the only thing that identifies us to each other because we are bound in five senses see taste feel smelling here and as long as we can see or feel one another why we have evidence that we're here if you're blind and can't can't see then you can feel one another hear one another and the Earthly senses declare one another but really frankly we have never seen each other so glad the prophet said that I can say it amen you've never really seen me but you know I take that back because if you were in the mind of God and a real thought you probably saw me before but it wasn't with eyes like this and seeing like we see in the natural if you were there we were together amen but frankly when we get to this Earthly Dimension talking Earthly we really frankly we have never seen each other did you know that we have never seen one another you hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever is on the inside praise be to God amen now I'm gonna I'm going to a close and I'm going to get into the real heart of what I want to say I said all of that to get here I'm going to go back to a couple older messages brother Branham preaches and in 1956 he preaches the Intervale so no those the Manna fell outside the courts and remember the people eat this manna but God told them to take up this man and put it put a bunch of it back in the Holy place and there was the ark the ark is a type of the human heart the ark the place the hidden place so in you is a hidden place a hidden place that's the ark what was in the ark the word and there in the ark they would take a portion of this manna that was falling all over the camp day by day they would take a portion of this Manna they would put it in a gold pot that represented Divinity and they would place it there in the ark and there in the Shekinah Glory of God it was preserved and fresh always that right but where was it it was in the hidden place and the Ark represents the human heart the ark was also the Throne of God where God wanted to dwell between the wings of the cherubim and in the ark was the word if you're a sea Gene of God what was Planet what was in your soul when you came to this life there was seed Gene of God attribute of God word was inside of you amen now I want to read several scriptures we're going to stay in the New Testament but I'm going to read out of you first Samuel you don't have to turn there but first Samuel 16 6. says and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on iliab and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him this is Samuel going to anoint the king over Israel and he comes to the house of Jesse and the oldest son comes and he thought surely this is him but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of a stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as a man'seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart question is what is God looking for and when it comes to you and I what is God looking at what's he looking for and where will he find it will he find it on the outside realm of you we find in the spirit realm of you what is God looking for he's not looking for those things that come from the outside he's looking from that which is buried on the inside the Lord looketh on the heart um let's go to Mark we'll look at a couple scriptures here in New Testament Mark chapter 7. Mark chapter 7. verse 6. he answered and said unto them well hath Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites that it has written this people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me they were so religious that with their lips they were declaring to be believers they were declaring that they honored God and honored in his word but down in the heart and the Soul it was far removed from God God wasn't looking to the lips he was looking to the heart Matthew let's go to Matthew 23. Matthew 23 and verse 25. Matthew 23 25 he says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites if you make clean the outside of the cup of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you are likened to the whitest sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity I want you to say that the part God is most interested in is inside I think sometimes we get serving God and the idea of true worship and service to God I think sometimes we're too outside focused and in a way we can become secure like the Pharisees were secure when they were outside focused they were children of God they were Seed of Abraham because they could receive the law of Moses because they could do statutes and judgments and orders and because they could do that they believed that they were Seed of Abraham they were part of the promise and Jesus confronts them in the Book of John and and they they say we you know we be Abraham's children and he says I know you're Abraham seed but you don't do the works of Abraham then he says if you were Abraham's seed you would believe me so now he goes all the way down to Faith in the heart and the Seed of Abraham is not declared by the outside ordinance the Seed of Abraham is declared by faith in the soul because that faith is a gift and that Faith gift comes from the sea Gene of God so they had a order of religion they had an order of worship and their order of worship could have the heart separated from God but the body and I would say even the spirit worshiping God so they could be engaging God and interacting with God In the Flesh and in the spirit but their heart could be far from God and God was not fooled by this kind of worship in Romans Chapter 2 I'll just read this to you as well stay in the Book of Matthew Romans chapter 2 verse 28 for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly Apostle Paul saying this neither is that circumcision which is the outward and flesh but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God now he's coming down to show who the real Jew is not the one with the birth certificate the real Jew is the one that's one inwardly and the circumstances listen the Jews had a sign a seal that was given to Abraham to seal this Covenant they had circumcision physically and they could show a physical circumcision and say look I'm under the Covenant of physical circumcision but Paul's coming along and saying that's not it it's not anything on the outside but the genuine circumcision is invisible is not seen your circumcision is not something you can show in proof and give evidence on under the Covenant your circumcision is unseen but I'll tell you who can see the Unseen God can see into your soul and he knows what's there [Music] the rest of us can't we can see effects we can see the way there's the wind moving things we can see evidences amen but there's only one who can Pierce through all of that through your flesh and through your soul and your spirit and get all the way down to your soul and he can see what's there and that's what he's looking for there's a scripture actually I do want you to turn this one we'll come back to Matthew but let's go to First Peter this is a strange scripture for me to use this way first Peter 3. all right first Peter 3 and verse 3. he's speaking to women to wives and he says who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating of the hair and wearing gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which in the sight of God is of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God Adorn themselves being in subjection to their own husbands he's speaking to wives how to conduct themselves to their husbands but also the church is a woman we believe she's a married woman and so this applies to us as well he says let your adorning not be the outward adorning plating the hair and wearing of gold into putting on apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and which is not which is not corruptable that the outside all of those things will fade away and corrupt but the genuine in the soul will be eternal amen even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price he goes on to talk about those that were submissive to their husbands because we're to be submissive to the word but as a church as all churches they begin to move towards outward adornment to become beautiful picture perfect is that right this is what churches do but he said don't let your adorning be of this outward Beauty of this outward glamorization but let it be the hidden man of the hearts that's what will make the difference it doesn't matter what what we do I don't say it doesn't matter it matters what we do on the outside but you can never overcompensate on the outside what's failing on the inside you can never make up for it on the outside you can never sing loud enough to make up for a void in your soul you can never pray enough hours to make up for for having no new birth and no relationship in your soul with God there's no substitute for the hidden man of the heart let's go back to Matthew chapter 6 now Matthew chapter 6. verse 5. and without prayers Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I say unto you they have their reward I want a greater reward than that oh he's a great man he's a Godly Man look how he prays and look how he serves God and brother Jesus is saying that's the end of their reward the reputation they have on this life they have it that's their reward but oh I want a greater reward than that friends I don't want my reward to end in this life it goes on to verse 6 but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when that was shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret and the father would seeth in secret shall reward thee openly he's saying how shall you worship God how shall you pray how shall you serve God Amen not from the outward from the n-word amen When you pray don't stand and pray now there's nothing wrong with praying outside we we pray over our meals together we pray at church there's nothing wrong with that but it shouldn't stop there we've got to go down into our closet down into our soul down to where he that seeest in secret what secret The Secret of your soul The Secret of that realm where nobody else can get to the privacy of your innermost being amen where the ark is amen the human heart [Music] let's go down there that that is where God is looking amen their mouth is this their body is this their worship is this their praise is this but what where is the the secret I want to see into the secret part and I want to see what's done secretly then the relationship that becomes the most important relationship is now the secret relationship not the public relationship but the secret relationship a lot of things can be done publicly like the Pharisees did but they didn't at the end they didn't matter for not Jesus said your Whited sepulchers full of dead men's bones in the inside you have your reward but oh let it be the hidden man of the heart let it be that we go into a closet and I don't I don't mean you literally can only pray in a closet to have this kind of relationship but go down privately with just you and God Amen it's the prayers you pray in your heart that are the most meaningful the real the relationship you have in secret with God is your relationship I I hope that you catch what I mean we can all have a church relationship with God where we as a church worship God as a church we respect his word as a church we keep the order as a church we can do it as a family we can children and a parent's home they can worship God as a family worships God and and they stay in respect and honor to the word of God and respect and all of that that's that's a good form of worship we praise God for that but the real worship of God is the secret worship of God the way you worship God secretly privately in the chambers of your innermost being that is your worship to God that's the one that that's where the reality is and when the reality comes the reality is coming for the reality Within so that these two realities make a contact will that have an effect on the outside absolutely if it doesn't then we've got some questions it should change our Behavior it should change our conduct it should change our address it should change our public worship it should change our fellowship with one another it should change all of that but you can't work on the outside and have it affect the inside it must be the reality and the secret part of your life that's the worship that's the real genuine true worship to God now I want to finish with this quote I want to read this quote because this is the one that had so much impact on me and the message of the Hidden line from 1955. said God said Moses make you a gold pot Hallelujah and in their place this Manna and remember that a Believer when he walked in there that Mana never did run out he's talking about the Manna in the golden pot in the holy of holies in the most inner chamber where it was never public nothing in that inner chamber was public everything in that inner chamber was private hid behind veils it was in secret it was a mystery the high priest went in there once a year amen but nobody could see what was happening in that inner chamber it was secret it was Private it was beyond the vision inside of anybody else and in there there was manna that was placed in there that was kept fresh and could be taken and eaten by the high priest now he says now remember the believer when he walked in there the Mana never did run out it was always fresh and new and sweet as the day when it went by as the years went by and any man who comes to Christ and hides away and the veil falls behind him he's in the presence of almighty God eating the Manna day and night from one hour to the other it's always just as sweet as it was the first day of telling telling to your soul that's what we need today is get in where the things are where in where the things are at not stand off and pretend or not stand off and act but actually get in there now remember only Believers only the elect comes into that that God has chosen you I believe that in Revelation 2 he says he that overcometh so it's promised to Overcomers you said I overcome smoking that ain't what he's talking about so he's looking that's still the outside realm I I quit lying I quit doing this that's not what he's talking about you said I overcome smoking that ain't what he's talking about there's a whole lot more goes to Christianity besides not smoking cigarettes or drinking whiskey he that overcometh shall inherit all things and he will be my son I will be his God and listen I will give him of the Hidden manner I will hide him away and I will give him the hidden things the world on the outside of the curtain don't know nothing about Hallelujah though they eat Manna but they don't know about this I will give to him the hidden Manna I will give him a stone with his name on him you get what I mean entering into the adoption or the hidden place with God ministers all of the Gospel don't don't care about your denominations and what the world thinks but seek to enter into the hidden Manna where the full revelation of God is make love perfect in your heart and you and God and everything else is at rest let anything come what you may you're hidden away what a place to live oh just let me abide there as long as the song said Let me let me rest beneath the tree where the water so freely flows where the lamb is the light and the soul of the save never die amen sure they eat Mana out there but they didn't know about this they never been in there have you my dear brother don't despise my ignorance but I want to ask you something Have you ever come to a place in life where Christ meant more to you than all that arguing you could do about your church I like that amen has Christ meant more to you than all the world I don't mean from an emotion or a mental work of I mean from the depths of your heart that something settled in there that something's taken place that you don't know how it come but you're hid away and your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you entered that place my dear brother have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and act smart but till the love of God Is So anchored into you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of God love for everybody flowing free from everywhere what a place to live that's the hidden place that's the place where we go God to come to my brethren that's the place where God Reveals His secret things that's the place where God does the placing and the calling everybody else is eating manna as the man of offense but there was a special Manna preserved in the Shekinah Glory of God and it was reserved for a private feasting yes yes only when one would enter in into the Shekinah Glory got into the most holy place where the Ark of God was where the word of God was where the Manna was fresh amen he could eat this manna that never Fades away that means this man has kept fresh All Through Time they could eat man on day by day we could go to church day by day we could get pumped up on Wednesday and come back on Sunday we can eat Manna we can go enjoy it amen but the reality has to come where we by ourselves enter into this Third Realm we enter into the depths of soul in a relationship with just God and us and in there is a private man and nobody on the outside knows about where we can Rejoice at the at the preaching of the word we can Rejoice at the tapes we can Rejoice at all of that and we can eat Mana good but there has to come a feasting with the King that takes place in the depths of our soul where he begins to give you a fresh Revelation that will never fade away that won't fade away when you walk out of the sanctuary won't fade away on Tuesday when the trial comes won't fade away on Thursday but there's a fresh Manna in the innermost chamber where you can feed on and it's kept fresh all the time and what is it it's a revelation it's a revelation in that place it's a revelation of God and if it's a revelation of God and if it's a full revelation of God then it's also a revelation of you and in that place is the reality in in the depths of our innermost being in the reality of the new birth when that seed is sprung to life and now beginning to take control our relationship there is the reality because it's the real coming to the real now that may Express hourly that may come up and come out my mouth that may come in my contact that will not May that will come into my conduct come out of my mouth come out of all of that but those are just Expressions expressing what happened down here the reality is not what happens out here the reality is what happens in here and what happens out here is a reflection amen or a demonstration or an expression of what happened down here but the reality is what happened down here that's why a church walk is not going to work lip service group things group religion it's not going to work what has to happen is what has always been real is what is really real the attribute of God that was real literal expressed in existence with God is in the soul of the believer and that Springs to life at an encounter a meeting with the Living God under the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that life on the inside is now a communion with you and God Amen to where there's things that take place in your soul that you cannot describe to another human being there is a relationship that you have with God that is Indescribable that is so deep that there's not even words to explain what God is doing inside of you that is the reality that goes beyond flesh that is that is the unseen reality expressing in this reality that's what I'm striving for that's what I'm preserving that's what I'm holding on to have you ever have you ever just had God just sweep down into your soul and you just bust out in tears for no reason whatsoever and you try to explain that to somebody what was that it was more than emotion it wasn't an emotion there was nothing to be emotional about the ever drawn to you has he ever come in has he ever come to you and done heart surgery and cut something out of your heart and you know he just did you talk to him do you talk to him not at prayer time but at any time is I'll say the way brother bear says it have you ever come to a place in life where Christ meant more to you than all the arguing you could do about your church as Christ meant more to you than all the world I don't mean from some emotion or mental work or maybe from the depths of your heart that something settled in there that's something taking place and you don't know how it come but you're hid away and your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ that's the reality of being a Christian everything else is an expression of that but that's the hardcore reality and I thank God that that's the relationship he wants to have with us we want God wants us we love God but you can never love God unless he first loved us our desire is the reciprocation of his desire he wanted us first he came up with the plan first he desired us first where does this desire come from where does life come from it comes from the unseen reality of God amen but it's real it's invisible but it's real it's invisible but it's the realest part of who I am and that's real Christianity man let's all Stand Together I'm going to finish with this quote just want to leave with this thought in our mind that I want the real the real I mean the real that come before anything else that's real the genuine God is the real real is heaven real yes is Earth real yes but all that real came from the real real and I want the real real real God to be real in my soul and I want my relationship to him to be really real and I want everything that comes out from that to be an expression of real if it affects my attitude I want it to be real if it affects my dress I want it to be real if it affects my relationship I want it to be real whatever comes from that reality I want to be an expression of the real for then whatever manifestation it is in it'll be a real manifestation of the reality oh I thank God that this is the hour we're living in you realize the union has to be an invisible Union where we're at now it has to be because it's got to go beyond everything that's somewhat real to strike the really real and from there it'll bring every expression into place and let's bow our heads and pray together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord God I'm so thankful for the hour we live in when you're calling us to the greatest reality God help us I pray you helped me Lord help me to move Beyond the outside and move deep within God help us not to have a religion that looks to impress or to prove no matter who we impress Lord no matter whom we prove we're a Christian too we can never hide from you nor God do we want to hide from you on your word exposes us we're not living in the age of partial we're not living in the time Lord of group but Lord this is to the individual but I pray you'd come to individual Hearts right now Souls that are holding a gene Lord of yours that we're Beyond time that we're Beyond any other existence God May the word come may you come to that soul and Quicken that seed to life many who's not experienced the reality may they experience what is really real May their faith take a whole Lord May their faith be substance May their faith be the evidence of this thing that's unseen well I mean you bring us into an invisible Union with you a marriage not that's been seen not that was observed by Immortals the Lord a marriage an invisible Union that your bride has entered into with you may you Lord take your Abode in the inner chamber of our heart may you come and sit on your Ark your throne God may you feed us from the golden part of Revelation to reveal this reality to us God made this reality have an effect on us that it would change our thinking our Behavior our reactions may this reality become really real to us granted father by the spirit of Revelation may you open the chambers of our heart may you pour your spirit in are you Quicken us to life and may we be real genuine reality expressed in this dimension we love you father we ask for your help guide us Lord guide our feet bless us as we go bless our lunches and our fellowships but bring us back lord in the communion time and we come back with a heart that's really on fire a heart that's full of gratitude for what you've done for us to redeem us May the reality of these things grow in US till they take over our being we love you father and thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen praise God I love you all we'll be back for communion here at 4 pm
