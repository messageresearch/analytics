get tired of me turning to genesis chapter one amen but praise god it's just the way it is so we want to follow the leading of the lord and look here at genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 we've read this a lot through our lives and we've read it a lot of late and we may read it a lot more as we continue on but we'll start here genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and god created man oh thank you brother i'm just gonna share so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed him and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth let's pray lord jesus we ask that you would bless this reading of your word lord and lord we pray god to be more than just the ability to read but may you do more than that for us now lord may you break it down by revelation may we absorb it lord by revelation may we become one with this word and may it be in us living and breathing and moving through us lord we surrender ourselves to you we pray that you would come and break the bread of life this evening for us that we might feed from your hand lord jesus we ask it in jesus name amen you can be seated and i want to begin with a quote here this evening and i quoted part of this at the end of the service on sunday and i just want to spend a little more time in it because it's i find it amazing but it's out of the pergamian church age from the church age book and it's the section that's uh in italics there because it's where brother branham was told by the angel lord to pick up his pen and write and he began to write and so it's italicized there in the church age book and that's where i'm going to begin right at the beginning of that and just read a portion of that he begins he says here's what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own kind amen this is a this is an important foundation that we want to get a hold of that each specie brings forth of its own kind even according to genesis 1 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass in the herbing seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride church christ's seed will come to the headstone and she will be the superchurch a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with them they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations can never produce this wrong seed so you put in parentheses wrong seed that's the reason they can never produce this they have the wrong seed because each species brings forth after its kind so the denominational seed must always produce a denominational life but it has to be christ's seed and christ's seed produces christ the denominations cannot produce produce this wrong seed they will produce their creeds and their dongas mixed with the word this mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product now now i want to get into this a little deeper pay close attention here the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself so i took out of this a a text for tonight and for a title i want to say the purpose of the bride that's our title tonight the purpose of the bride and i'm taking it from this quote here and i'm going to read this again the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die i think this thing this is amazing amen because because the word alone has life and believes the word brings death anything outside the word brings death the word alone brings life the word alone is life so we understand that concept so now when she left the word amen when she went with reasoning and wisdom contrary to the word of god now her act was going to bring death amen but adam was going to redeem her redeem his wife amen and redeeming his wife he would have to leave the word amen and when he left the word it caused him to die it caused him to die amen now says the second son jesus also a spoken seed word of god was given a bride like as was adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died okay now we go all the way back to god's original purpose and god's original intent amen adam was given a bride to reproduce himself amen and so we see a concept with god that god is going to take male and female and male and female together will reproduce life it's a concept that's a law of god every seed will bring forth after its own kind but when when adam was going to bring forth after his own kind he was given a wife and that wife was going to be given to him to reproduce himself but instead of waiting on the word amen she went without the word she went by reasoning and wisdom and by reasoning and wisdom she brought death not life and so so it caused adam to fall she caused adam to die amen but then god restored adam amen in the last adam which we know is jesus christ and the bible refers to him as the last adam because there's no more need for another atom after him we don't need another adam he is the last adam because he is the son of god amen he was god reproduced himself in flesh the body that he created and dwelt in as the son of god and he lived the perfect life he kept all the law he never was disobedient to the father amen and god had restored back adam amen and restoring back adam now he came in full obedience to the word not leaving the word not leaving one eye out of the word this adam didn't leave the word to redeem his wife this adam stayed with the word and gave his life and death voluntarily to redeem his wife and then the god raised him up they met on the third day and now he can die no more because he kept the word to redeem his wife he didn't leave the word to redeem his wife it makes sense so he kept the word amen and gave his life to redeem his wife amen and he cannot die but when she left the word she doubted she left the word she died we still could not bring forth the full purpose of god because she died so when she caused adam to die we couldn't bring forth the purpose of god amen so now he had to restore adam when he restored adam he gave adam back another bride but that bride left the word she fell she died so now it's the the plan of god is still needing one male and one female amen it still needs the male and the female of the same specie because this cannot be hybridization amen so god's purpose god's plan would still require amen a son and the son's bride amen to come together to reproduce amen another son of god to reproduce the life of the son again upon earth and so god now he cannot leave it in that condition he has to restore because he's got to bring it back to his original intent his original perp his original plan and when he told them be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth amen now he's got to bring forth of his word and it failed the first time and now he restored adam now adam's bride now the one that was was given to him as a restored last adam jesus christ bride she fell amen and she died but god began to build back amen to bring back another bride because there's got to be a bride that will finish the purpose then he goes on to say here in this pick up your pen and right section from a little group of the true seed of the word see it has to come from the true seed of the word because there can be no hybridization so it's got to be of the same seed same word same specie from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with the beloved bride you see why a denomination a church system can never accomplish this amen because they've already been hybridized they've already been brought forth on the wrong scene amen it can only be when god brings back a virgin bride amen and how is she virgin she's virgin by the word because there came a word in this day amen with such life and such power that the word in this day would break every barrier of denominationalism every barrier of hybridization amen and pierced down to the genuine original seed that's down on the inside of the children of god and would pierce all the way down and awaken that seed and that seed is virgin amen and when that seed wakes up and comes to life it takes the pure word for the day to depart the waters of confusion amen to part away all denomination and all creeds and all dogmas but it takes that bright light in this last day to move it all away amen to strike the original seed that's down in the soul and bring it to life and when it does that's a virgin born again new creation of christ jesus virgin bride never did it in the first place you were trapped into it of no fault of your own amen god is going beyond the mind beyond the flesh beyond the human spirit all the way down to the seed with the word that can bring that seed to life in this thing so that he can present him his his last adam so he can present his last adam with the bride to fulfill the purpose aren't you glad you have the message inside aren't you glad you're alive in this day man there's chaos breaking out all around but i'm glad i'm here today i'm glad many prophets and wise men have longed to see your day amen and have not i tell you there's many all the way down through the church ages that long to see this day to understand amen there was men who poured over their bible and then poured over the writings of the fathers to try to understand this great mystery of god amen but to us it's been freely given amen what a day that we live in friends from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride i want to ask you a question who's presenting whom to who he doesn't say there's finally going to come a group of people who get their act together he didn't say there's finally after all denominations finally the people will wake up and realize the nominations failed and they'll get their act together they'll come back to the word no god amen he's going to take from the true seed of the word he's going to take god is going to present him son of bride this is god's doing this is god's work that's why you can't it won't fail friends it can't fail it's prophesied in this day not to fail from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is virgin of his word she is virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin the word of promise came to the virgin mary but the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest so the word came to mary mary wasn't looking for the word the word came to mary and she received the word and the life of that word came into mary and produced its own life and lived its own life in her and came through her it wasn't what mary did mary had nothing to do with it it was what mary surrendered herself to what she accepted what she believed what she received by faith that's all that mary could do but the word came to mary amen it was in a form of the promise and the promise was he himself to be made manifest in the virgin god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6. he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her it still takes a female it still takes a female brother brethren said in the restoration of the bride tree he said but what he was god's perfect prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory going to say something directly he is the bridegroom tree do you believe it from the garden of eden then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bride tree amen god said it all the way up in the beginning in the shadow he couldn't do it by himself when he was alone he's got to have a bride tree to bring forth amen and so the the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bride tree she has got to be born of the same material the word made flesh in the tree hope you get it it's the same life in the female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride the works that i do shall you also praise be to god so there's still there still has to be amen a female there still has to be a virgin that can be presented unto the sun and to the last adam so that so that that bride can be given to him so that he can reproduce himself and and you know when it came to the virgin mary which now he's typing this in this section in the pergamus church age when it came to mary amen mary didn't have to strain and she didn't have to strive and she didn't have to be wise and she didn't have to be educated and she didn't have to pour over the manuscripts amen to get to this place all she had to do was receive what the angel was telling her and she amen she had to accept it she had to believe it she had to receive it amen and that's all that he needs for us to do in this day is just surrender to it amen just accept what what he's telling her the word is coming to the bride the bride just needs to accept it he accomplished all that he promised in that day because she accepted the word let's turn to isaiah together i want to read a couple places here in the scripture isaiah 53. isaiah 53 and verse 4. and isaiah 53 and verse 4 says surely he hath borne our griefs and carry our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before he shares his dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from the prison and from the judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken so the question that i want to leave with is this question that's asked here in isaiah uh 53 and 8 for who for for who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living he was cut off amen he was cut off before he could take a wife before he could bring forth children before he could bring forth his generation he was cut off he was cut off out of the land of the living so who will declare his generation we pick up this same scripture over in acts chapter 8. let's go to acts chapter 8. this is amazing this question because in isaiah when he asked a question but he doesn't give the answer to the question and let's look at acts chapter 8 and verse 26 we'll start at verse 26. in the angel of the lord spaking the philip saying arise and go toward the south and to the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert and he rose and went and behold a man of ethiopia a eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for the worship was returning and sitting in his chariot reading isaiah's the prophet then the spirit saith unt unto philip go near and join thyself to hysteria and philip ran thithered to him and heard him read the prophet isaiah and said understand us thou what thou readest and he said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired philip that he should come up and sit with him and the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so opened he not his mouth in his humility his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth oh boy what a good question who shall declare his generation for his life was taken from the earth and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or some other man then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus amen i want to ask you who was there to declare his generation philip was there to declare his generation the question was amen who shall declare his generation this is the place where the eunuch was reading from amen and he was reading as the lamb led the slaughter and he opened not his mouth and who shall declare his general generation for his life was cut off from the land of the living and he asked the question who is the prophet speaking of amen because now the fulfillment of this prophecy the fulfillment of the lamb led as a slaughter he that amen he that opened not his mouth that fulfillment was jesus christ but he was cut off from the land of the living and now the eunuch has a question about who he is and what's the fulfillment and who is this speaking of amen and who's going to declare his generation that's what it ends with and philip beginning at the same scripture preached unto him jesus because there was somebody on the earth a bride amen that could declare his generation [Music] praise be to god brother abraham says and the spoken word is the original seed the eunuch he had been with all the dd's and ld's and everything but why didn't he get something he come back down studying the prophecy of isaiah brother man said he was up at the camp meeting in jerusalem amen with all you know the you know the theologians and everything and he didn't get the answer to his question because there's got to be somebody who can declare his generation he says he goes on to say the same quote although an angel directed philip to him but the germ of life had to come through the body philip oh brother now we're on the line where did the germ come from through the angel the angel showed him where to go an angel is a messenger here is a son philip had the germ the message the word that's how a child can be born hey amen who will declare his generation amen where who's going to continue amen where where's the progeny going to come from where's the children going to come from who will declare his generation philip was there he had the seed which was the message the word amen that's how children can be born because it's got to come from the body of christ amen philadelph laid his hands upon him philip baptized him in the name of jesus christ there come forth the spirit of god sure now the germ had to come from the body what body christ body correct and philip was a member of the body hallelujah two paragraphs down he says and while peter spake these words he goes right to peter to cornelius's house while peter spake these words not the angel not the cardinal well peter spake these words what he was the body he had the word the word took hold o brother oh my angel directed it but the life come through the body of christ because the man and the woman has become one amen she has his life she has his word she has the message amen and life has to come through the body of christ who shall declare his generation i say it can only be his bride she's the only one that can do it brother branham says in christ is the mystery of god revealed there's just one little phrase he said the word only has life the word only nothing else the word only has life and and christ or the message it is the rising of the sign he says notice the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he has risen go tell my disciples that i am risen from the dead and i will meet them to confirm this to them oh god how in the last day there shall be light again across the earth and i'll prove to my disciples go tell them that i'm not dead i'm not a tradition but i'm a living christ i'll meet them take this message to my disciples that i am risen from the dead the gospel good news you say is that right hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever we his beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now the beneficiaries of his life the life there never was a life lived like it he was the son of god and he died and that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that he is living and how can we do it by word only if it is written the gospel came not in word only but through the power and manifestation of the holy spirit to prove that he is alive praise god philip had more than words he had the message he had the seed he had the germ but he had the life [Music] the word brings life the word is life he had the life of the word and he had the message of that lie amen and he had something that he could give out and the message the choosing of the bride so i remember one time a prophet went to take a king to make a king out of jesse's son to take another king's place saul and so jesse brought him out his great big fine boy he said the crown will look right on his head the prophet went to pour the oil on him he said god has refused him and he refused every one of them till he came to the little old stoop shouldered ready looking fellow and he poured the oil upon him and he said god chose him see we choose by sight god chooses by character character there never was a character like jesus christ i want you to think about that statement there never was a character like jesus christ jesus christ was the reflection of god he was the image of god and made manifest he was something that the world could look to and know what the father is well what the characteristics of god were what the attitude and approach of god they could they could look to the son they could look at jesus christ and the son was a reflection of his father and there never was a character like jesus christ it lives in you and manifest him we see it's true it's not worldly beauty of him that attracts his bride it's his character the character of the church that jesus looks for not where it's big buildings where it's great denomination where it's big membership he promised to meet with wherever two or three are gathered together see there never was a character like christ so christ can never have a bride unless there's a bride like him amen because brother brahma even told us he said a a man that'll take a wife shows what he's thinking of his future home shows what's on the inside of him by the wife that he chooses and that's why christ could not be united with any of these denominations because they didn't have his character his character was i only do that which the father shows me he did nothing outside the will of his father he did nothing unless his father first showed him he was a son in absolute perfect submission to the will of his father and he could not have a wife with any different character than his character because he cannot bring forth hybridization amen she must be of the same root amen she must have this she must be the same specie that he is because he cannot christ will not hybrid amen so he can only unite with what has come from the same source as him or as the same specie as him and he is the manifested word he can only unite with the manifested word amen but when we saw the fullness of the word made manifest it had a character to it amen it had it had a an obedience and a submission amen and a gentleness and a sweetness and a character and a zeal for the word all of these things that we saw in jesus christ was the character that was reflecting the father amen now in the sun that had been restored from the sun that fell all the way back in the garden that was restored and there was never a character like this character but god was going to present him a virgin bride amen and that virgin bride will be a mere match to him she must have the same character he cannot unite with another specie that's why amen what we do and how we act and our temperament matters friends it matters because christ is looking for character he's looking for something that will reflect him god amen god was looking for a son that could reflect him and all of them failed until he got to this son he was looking for now a wife that would reflect the husband but they all failed until he gets to this one amen so now by the spoken word he's going to create his own bride by spoken word so he's going to speak the word and inside of you is a receptor for that word if you're bride of jesus christ down inside of you has been implanted something from before the foundation of the world that was placed in your soul way back there that's been waiting amen for the right season for the right time to spring the life and it's a receptor for this spoken word in this day amen so that he can have a spoken word bride not a reformed bride amen not a trained bride he wants a spoken word bride and the only way he can have a spoken word bride amen because all of humanity was sown into hybridization how is he going to bring this back amen we see what he did with his son he actually sowed a life his life into the virgin womb of a woman and that life amen came forth an absolute perfection no hybridization but his bride now has come through the same way that all humanity has come amen we in our flesh and we weren't born amen the way jesus christ was born we were born fallen in a fallen condition with a fallen nature with the fallen spirit but god had implanted a portion of himself in our soul before the foundation of the world amen because he was going to have a spoken word bride and he knew that when he got to the time that he was going to unite christ with his bride that he would send the purity of the spoken word in our day without without mixture with denomination without hybridization but back to the pure original word and the pure original word was going to come and connect with that seed and it was going to be spoken word bringing spoken word life spoken word birth to a spoken word virgin bride it's the only way he can have a virgin bride in this day is he must bring a virgin word a pure unadulterated word and that pure unadulterated word when it goes down to the pure seed of god and quickens it to life he now has a new creature a new creature born again erases the first birth born again a new creature in christ jesus in the soul and that is a spoken word bride and she's virgin of his word because she was birthed by the virgin word she wasn't birthed by hybrid word she was birthed by the virgin word and being birthed by the virgin word she will have his characteristics she will have his character that character he had to fully submit to the word she'll fully submit to the lord no matter what she grew up in what chicken yard she was in or what denominational church she raised up and what idea or concept of man when she came in when she sees that word no matter how she was taught when the word said you women don't cut your hair she said that's it for me i'm not gonna cut my hair when the men were told dropped these filthy habits and dropped this they said i'll drop it why because she has his characteristics that's the bride that he's looking for that's the only kind he can unite with the one that's the same specie so there's now no more hybridization praise god i'll say like brother bear said now do you see the message now do you see the message now do you know what those seals were hiding now do you know what those seals uncovered what he's been doing is he's building back at churches he's getting it back to a condition where he can bring a spoken word birth and unite it back to his perfect sign amen so that now she can declare his generation and finish the work and finish the purpose amen and finish the plan of god brother ben said in the message things that are to be now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of god because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life that was god there to be a son of god you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there ever was before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god [Music] now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or daughter of god therefore you get what i mean see you are you are now made you are sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate amen let's turn to colossians 1 this is another scripture we quote all the time almost every service but i'm not going to apologize for it colossians chapter 1 verse 26 even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations i hope that means more to you than it's ever meant just that terminology the mystery that's been hid from ages and generations i tell you friend there's been a mystery amen the mystery of the old testament was jesus christ but the mystery of the new testament is the bride of christ there's been a mystery that was foreshadowed all the way back in the garden and there's been a mystery all along but now to the bride it's not a mystery to the bride it's a secret and now she has the fellowship of the mystery even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory that's it friends this is the revelation of the mystery what is the revelation of the mystery christ in you the hope of glory brother ben said in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says it's god himself see it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride catch that terminology the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like adam did at the beginning like adams was rather at the beginning so he says it's god himself see it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through he's he's been governing the body all the way through then the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride that means the complete body of christ wasn't completed before when jesus christ was here but the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side in choosing of the bride i read this quote last sunday but in the message the choosing of a bride he says the other is pregnanted by the word of god it will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride because why because there's been a foreshadow laying down all the way in the beginning in the book of genesis this seventh seal was revealed it was laying there in a shadow that when his first son adam would come within adam was the components to make his bride amen his flesh and his spirit was there but when god looked down on it he said it's not good that man should dwell alone amen and god was not in the habit of saying his creation was not good and he said it's not good that some man shall dwell alone i will make for him a help meet amen and then he pulled out of his side a rib amen and brother man told us he split the feminist spirit from him and he formed the woman and he united two together and brother branham said in the crowning act of creation and now when god is done with this he makes the statement when he saw all that he had done and all that he made behold he said it is very good and after that he takes a rest so all the way back we begin to see that god was creating creating creating creating he got to the sixth day it looks like he's done he comes all the way up in this evolutionary style of creation brother branham said from the sea creatures and the birds and the frogs and works his way all the way up and finally he's got something that's reflecting his image and flesh and it's a son it's adam and he gets this and it looks as if he's done this is the mystery friends because this isn't the masterpiece yet this is part of the masterpiece but the masterpiece image is a masterpiece family amen it can't just be the first part so in god's mind he knows he's not done amen it looks like a climax but it's not a climax it's a false climax and it looks like he's done but he's not done amen and he puts him in dominion and then he he places him in dominion in the garden and over all he's as a god on the earth and it looks as if he's finally achieved all of his creation up to the capping he's done amen but then he says it's not good when he looks at his masterpiece he's made all the breaststrokes amen he's got in the setting he's put his son in the beautiful setting i mean he's worked and worked and worked and he finally he's got everything and he steps back and he looks and he says it's not good that man should dwell alone so you can see that god doesn't have afterthoughts you believe that he's not learning as he goes amen he's not getting to a place and say you know what i never even thought of this but it's not good that he's alone i can't believe i god already knew he already had his heart desire he already had a plan he already had an achievement a goal something he wanted to do and now he's showing it all the way back in genesis amen and in in in that son is a bride in that son amen is a daughter amen and he looks down he says it's not good that she dwell alone he hasn't come to his climax yet it only looks like the climax but the crowning act of achievement the climax will be when he pulls out of adam the female amen and brings the two and unites them back together as one and brother branham said that is the crowning act of all of creation and god couldn't rest until he got that and he cannot rest now until he finishes this bride amen until he finishes this bride amen until he gives the last adam the last woman amen until there's a final complete now we've come back he's got a son that reflects his character now that was fully submissive and obedient to the word now that son needs a bride of his same character and that bride's going to have to come out of him just like the first one it's got to be the same species got to come out of him and now this bride has got to come out of christ to be the bride of christ to be united back to him amen to do what to reproduce his life again and until god has finished that he cannot rest amen praise god the other is pregnant by the word of god he was speaking of the false church now that's been impregnated by the ideas of man wrong conception the other is pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is his bride the body of christ isn't finished yet because until the masterpiece is fully restored it's not finished yet how many knows that a man and his woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and to two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning man his wife are one what is the purpose of the bride to reproduce another son of god to reproduce himself again in the spoken word is the original seed he says that's what the matter today you want some kind of phony makeup with screaming jumping speaking in tongues and something instead of waiting for the real word of god to be manifest through the bride them kind that takes the word them kind that takes the word is god's true bride bringing forth children it's got to be by the word amen and it wasn't that it was not that eve did not want to bring forth children and the deception they meant eve was wanting to bring forth children she had a commandment to multiply and replenish but she didn't wait for the word amen she went by reasoning and by wisdom and any time amen the churches ever failed to wait on the word and go by reasoning and wisdom he mentions caused a failure but them kind that takes the word is god's true bride bringing forth children they can't die a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die all the denominations die they bring death and because only the word has life amen only the word is the seed only the word has life amen so they can't die a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word amen did you get that did you get it she can't die the child can't die because he's a word child he's a seed child he's an eternal child hallelujah spoken word is the original seed again now for the birth of the word is christ not of polluted with denominations the early church no denominations just the word and spirit and spirit irrigated amen god laid the word down like that and the holy spirit irrigated it and there she went she brought forth children certainly so god is showing us that the purpose originally amen is to be fulfilled in this day to bring forth children in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed he says and remember we are now as his bride pregnant with his spirit oh my the church bearing children see impregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminence as evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but alive forevermore this is eternal life and vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him how do you know because you're a church member because christ is living through you so pregnant with his spirit that you're a prisoner to anything else you're confined oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you can bring forth is that because you're a prisoner amen if we want to bring forth the right kind of life if we want to bring forth amen who shall declare his generation amen when philip there with the word had the life had the spirit had the word had the message when god amen picked him up and told him to move from here and move over there why because life comes through the body and he he has got to use him amen to bring forth life to this you knocked the eunuch there's going to be another child born but he's got to be born amen by the message by the word amen it's got to come amen through the life has got to come through the body so he brings philip over amen philip begins to explain to him the question he has out of the scripture and he's now declaring his generation and he physically takes him and lays hands on him amen baptizes him in jesus name laid his hands on him for the baptism of holy ghost amen and immediately he's gone boom he disappears and he shows up miles away in another city why because another child is born amen that ethiopian eunuch had come to life now he is part of the body he is part of the bride amen he now is going to bring forth life and brother benham said that ethiopian took the message down to ethiopia amen and started a revival down there why how how is he going to get to ethiopia how is he going to start a revival in ethiopia amen he's got to have the birth of the word and a child and there's got to be a vessel a bride upon the earth that'll carry that life that word that seed amen and bring forth another child then that child will go start a revival all the way in ethiopia this is god's plan amen amen that's why you know the there's so much you know attempts at evangelism in the denomination world that has no effect because god's method is to be contact he said salt must make contact to preserve life and the life goes from one to the other to the other to the other so who who on this planet has life and who can bring forth the seed who can bring forth the children of god because when the last one comes in then the rapture will go she is impregnated with the spirit he says in christ the mystery god revealed so confined to the gospel nothing else no other idea just the word confined to the word and all the children that you can bring forth is that because you're a prisoner praise god the other member said in future home he says like how them blind people can't see the serpent seed right there eve was put here on the earth and before satan ever touched her or anything else god said to them multiply and replenish the earth that's right but satan comes in here and that was adam's son then adam was a direct descendant of god and you only take the nature of your parent so brother ram is showing serpentine and he's showing the nature of cain and he's showing that cain could not have come from adam because the nature of cain and that's why denominationalism does not come from christ because they do the same thing that cain did amen they they have will worship self-will worship and worship according to their own dictates and their own judgments and their own desires and even when presented with the truth amen they will not take the truth but they continue on in their own way and so when you look at that that's why brother branham could look and he can say amen none of these amen none of these are are the bride of christ because they don't have the same nature amen they don't have the nature that that that church that system was not birth of christ because now they take their own word over the word of god now they go and do their own thing in their own way amen they've got a different nature than the nature of christ because christ never took his own way he only did that which the father showed him so when a church begins to take its own way amen and make its own decisions and do its own thing amen you can show it's showing that the birth wasn't right there was something wrong with the birth amen and brother brenham can look at that and say the denominations have all failed all the all the lutherans can bring forth is lutherans and the wesleyans will bring forth wesleyans and the pentecostals will bring forth pentecostals but the word bride can bring forth the word because she has the word she has the life she can bring forth a replica life of jesus christ a child that's born of the word becomes a prisoner of the word becomes bound by the gospel amen will only do what the word says and the message questions and answers from 1962 brother says and then when adam's son finally was born he was a gentle sweet humble meek person like adam we finally got to abel and the neighbor was killed and then seth was his replacement and when we finally get to adam's son adam's son reflected adam's nature when you get to abel abel now was worshipping amen by revelation amen he was worshiping god according to god's desire and now adam's son is reflecting adam's nature then seth is born and when seth was born now men begin to call upon the name of the lord now seth is reflecting his father's nature but cain in that line prove amen by their conduct and by their actions and by what they do with the word proved that they didn't come from the word amen and i said god let me live so surrender to the word amen that it reflects who my daddy is amen where i came from who my husband is and every child amen that we bring forth man everybody we witness to receives the message may they have the same character of jesus christ amen not propagating selfishness not propagating pride not propagating any attributes of lucifer it becomes so dangerous because it's so subtle and it gets so mixed but i say friends we have no desire and i know you're like me we have no desire to bring forth anything but the word of god amen but we must reflect the character of christ amen and gentleness and sweetness and humility and reverence and obedience and submission amen these have to be the characteristics of the bride because if not you're going to get a hybridization somewhere because he can only bring forth when he has a bride that's the same species i say god amen let me die out the self amen and be a word bride completely bound in chains of love confined to the gospel amen and the only thing that we propagate is the word not our own desires and our own goals and our own ambitions amen that's where churches have failed denominations have failed all the way down through amen instead of propagating the word they begin propagating their ambition amen that comes all the way back from their father lucifer amen instead of moving on in the word they got ambitious amen they had a program they had an agenda they had an achievement that they wanted to achieve amen and it was absolutely wrong and instead of bringing life amen it started to bring death i said let us be the bride of jesus christ and never push an agenda never bring our own will our own desire amen but to wait patiently on god so god can bring his will his desire his word and his word only so that there's anything that's brought forth from our efforts it'll bring forth another child of god born by the seed word of god reflecting back the life of that word amen okay finish this quote then when adam's son finally was born he was a gentle sweet humble meek person like adam so i wonder if if we're going to bring forth children of god what nature are they to have and if we're going to call ourselves bride of jesus christ what nature are we to have i say god reflect yourself in me lord birth by the word and the word only reflecting back the word in the word only but this fellow he's referring to cain now where did that pure lying where did that sin come from where did this fellow came that murder and the bible said that the devil is a murderer where did that lie come from the devil is the father of a lie he is a liar and the father of a lie it had to come from some resource outside of god so cain was the evil one and his father was satan and he brought forth this evil one praise god let's turn to john chapter 8. i want to finish in this portion of the scripture because it so embodies everything that we've read from the prophet what we've been talking about this evening john chapter 8 verse 38 and we know that the jews now are disputing with jesus christ in verse 38 says i speak that which i have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if ye were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham what a simple concept friends let's not make this complicated but let's keep it simple amen if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham now you know brother branham's not saying i'm not saying jesus wasn't saying that every action that they had to make amen had to be exactly correct like there's no more room for error or making a human mistake or doing that's not what we're talking about friends but we're talking about when it comes to the word and your will versus the will of the word amen there's that's where the problem lies amen when we'll manipulate the word or leave a peace out or add our own agenda or idea to it amen when we begin to do that you can tell there's a wrong influence somewhere going to bring a hybrid life out amen and if we if we manipulate the word at all soften it or change it or do anything to the word to try to bring forth children [Music] if we try amen to make this message more palatable amen if we try to leave out some of the bitter places amen of the land if we try to manipulate or change or flex or or somehow mold or pretty upper make more appetizing if we do anything to this message to try to win souls we are going to reproduce the life of lucifer not the life of christ amen because the children of god are born amen when the light of the age strikes that seed it comes to life when the pure unadulterated raw amen pure virgin word strikes a virgin seed it brings forth a virgin daughter but we don't manipulate it amen we don't change it we don't uh we don't make it uh more palatable or we don't add sugar to it to get the kids to take it those things are all dangerous that's reasoning and ideas of man trying to bring forth children amen we don't want to bring forth children we want to bring forth his seed amen and i only want to bring forth his seed if that's one more for the duration of our existence on this earth that's the only one we want that sounds horrible but that's the truth jesus came to seek and to save what was lost he came to save his own he said i didn't come i don't pray for the whole world amen i didn't come for the whole world but i come to say mind that we're in the world the ministry of jesus christ was the seek and to save that which was lost his own sheep that were lost and the ministry of christ is now in the bribe paul and barnabas amen they're going in their journey and they're preaching amen and as they're preaching the jews begin to resist them and he said it was needful that the gospel be first preached to you but be seeing that you count yourself unworthy of eternal life lo we turn to the gentiles then the gentiles began to rejoice and be glad and as many as were ordained unto life believed they didn't all believe but those that were ordained to life believe amen and paul didn't have to change his gospel to get the jews to keep him in the synagogue a little bit longer so that he could win the gentiles what do you do he preached the gospel that got him rejected he preached the gospel that got him kicked out he preached the gospel that got him stoned he preached the gospel that had him hated but he preached the gospel that those who were ordained to life would believe because we're not bringing forth our own children amen the bride doesn't have her own seed she's not out there trying to find a seed so she can replicate replicate replicate he said many more are the children of the desert the desolate than of the righteous it's not about winning numbers it's not a soul-winning program that's denominationalism amen it's about finding the lost seed and you can only find it with the true word for your day amen amen this message is powerful if we leave it alone amen this message has the power to bring a new birth if we leave it alone amen but if we tamper with it all it's going to do is bring some sort of reformation amen a little bit of morality mixed in with some reformation and an understanding of scriptures and another child of the devil that sounds horrible but as soon as you begin to hybrid it it can only bring forward hybrid life it's got to be left pure it's got to be left virgin it's got to be left powerful it's good the word has got to be left alone amen the woman does not have the right to manipulate the seed all she has the right to do is receive the seed so now very simple concept he says i speak that which i've seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father the answer said unto him abraham is our father do you say to him if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham what did abraham do abraham believed on him that was sent to him he believed the word of the lord and the day that it came to him the message of his day the message of the hour abraham believed it but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham you're abraham's children but you don't do what abraham does and you say you're born of the word for this hour but you don't stay true to the word for this hour there's something wrong he says now this did not abraham verse 41 you do the deeds of your father then they said unto him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god you think they didn't know serpent seed jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me i'm telling your friends if god is the father of these individuals out here you're witnessing to they will love the word because the word is christ this message is christ amen this message this word is christ and christ is now here in the formation of his bride if they love christ they'll love you amen and they'll love you for telling them the truth if god were your father you would love me for i proceedeth forth and and came from god neither came i have myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word i've said this before but they weren't deaf obviously they were communicating with them they were spiritually deaf they had no ears in the soul you are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of god see jesus didn't play around with the message and jesus didn't say oh you know i'm sorry that you didn't agree with me you're fine i'm fine we're all fine but jesus told him the truth because only the truth can set you free only the truth can set the seed free inside the soul that's bound over a cloud of darkness a cloud of denominationalism a cloud of man's ideas and hybridization only the truth can set that seed free now that doesn't mean that you present the message arrogant and mean and rough and nasty i don't believe that whatsoever brother branham gave us a perfect example of how to present but as nice as you can tell the truth with as much love in your heart for a lost soul as you can tell the truth don't water it don't manipulate it don't change it just tell the truth but tell it with as much love i mean if you're telling the truth to tell somebody off with the truth then you've got the wrong spirit to begin with amen we've been too many times amen we've been guilty of telling the truth and trying to tell it like jesus did amen but the only thing we were doing was mad and we wanted to tell somebody else so we told them the truth without the spirit of truth you can't tell the truth without the spirit of truth amen the spirit of truth and truth go together amen you were telling the truth with the spirit of another individual that was not christ [Applause] and we've all been guilty of it i said god forgive me and never let me do it again but if i bring the truth let me bring it in the spirit of truth amen and god is love amen and god is the one who told us don't just love those who love you back if you just love those that love you back what reward have you you love those amen that hate you that would despitefully use you that would do all manner of evil against you you love them because god loves the world he sendeth the reign on the just and the unjust amen so when we tell the truth we're telling the truth it may be just an unjust it may be tear but god sends the rain on the tear and the wheat amen why because of love jesus was not motivated by anger help self-preservation or attitude or arrogancy so when he said what he said the only way he could say it was out of love because god is love and god with his father it may hurt it may sting amen but it was the only thing that could help and i say god help me to tell the truth with a spirit of love because i've got to be of the same species you and i if we're going to bring forth children of this kingdom if we're going to declare his generation if we're going to help finish the body of christ then we can only bring forth by his word but we first must be the same species we first must be a spoken word bride brought to life by the spoken word and now virgin by a spoken word birth because he can only have a virgin bride and how are you going to be virgin with all you've done and all you believed wrong all your life how are you going to be a virgin birth bride when in the womb of your mind you have received all kinds of other seed all your life the only way to be virgin is to be born again then the old man is dead the new one has been brought forth by the word and as now as a virgin bride that can be presented to christ and as a virgin bride in this day by a by a virgin word amen being presented to christ now christ now can work through his bride to what to reproduce himself to bring forth another child and that child must be brought forth on the word so first you have to be the same specie got to be converted to be whatever he was you and i have to be the same then we must be united with him and as we're united with him then we must declare his generation in declaring his generation the germ of life the message the word the life comes forth and can contact another seed of life and the process can go on and on and on and on but it must be done correctly it must be sowed in love the life you live must be lived in absolute surrender to christ as a loved slave to christ the attitude that you reflect must be his the love that you must portray must be his it has to be him in you doing the works and then when god can flow through you and through me amen he can bring forth another child and another child and when the last one comes in the rapture will go i say god be praised said lord here i am here i am lord god you've called me you spoke to me you've quickened something that's in me and lord let me be bound by the gospel let no hybrid hybridized thoughts come in my mind actions come into my my actions lord let me be so surrendered to you that you can use me to complete your body how many more seeds out there how many more members of the body are lacking i have no idea they may all be in already we don't know but until we know let's go seek to save that which is lost let's give a true reflection of a true jesus christ let's portray a true life surrender to him and let's give true word true seed word that can bring life and if we're honest and if we're true if we're totally surrendered and totally submissive and speak the truth in love then if there's a seed out there it'll come it'll bring forth another child what we don't want to do is we don't want to look all around us and we don't want to look all around and say you know we've brought this to life and this the life and this the life and all the children that we have birthed have no reflection to jesus christ eve could say i have gotten a man from the lord but when cain acted the way he acted it proved who his father was and a church can say we've brought forth for christ we brought forth for christ but what we bring forth for christ will reflect who their daddy is and if everyone that we bring to christ amen begins to reflect their own will and their own desire their own life and something other than just the pure message begins to mingle it and mix it i tell you we need to be careful of what seed we're receiving and what seed we're dispensing but if there's some life that's coming forth amen from us as individuals or from this assembly it better be a life that reflects the father that reflects christ but when but when she brought forth abel he had a different nature when she brought forth seth he had a different nature and i say god we want to bring forth but we want to bring forth the completion of your body and me and my brothers and sisters and our children that are coming up and visitors and family members and those that will come in we want to sow the right seed in the right spirit with the right life to bring forth a life to complete the body of christ praise god why don't we labor in this together amen god bless you let's stand musicians if you'll come brother ben if you'll make your way up praise be to god when god was alone in heaven the first thing to come forth from god was the word i was the logos and through the logos and out of that logos he created everything that was created so out of god came the logos and out of the logos came all of creation but then out of christ will come abroad and out of the bride will come the rest of the body of christ it's the same pattern reflected there it's the same pattern reflected down here and i say god use us for your glory let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus god we thank you that you've made the gospel so clear to us in this day lord you've made the preaching of the gospel and the ministering of the word lord by demonstration you've put it before our eyes so we could see it we see your word that's been opened to us now we have no excuse lord god i pray you help us to surrender a greater surrender than we've ever had before god may it just be you and us and nothing else may we have a virgin birth by a virgin word so that we can be a new creation by spoken word and that we can be that virgin bride for all of our mistakes we pray you forgive us lord you'd wash us by the washing of the water the word but god you know our hearts desire you know what's in the core of each of us we just want to reflect you lord lord i pray that you would give us that power by your spirit lord to lift us up out of ourselves and out of laodicea out of selfishness lord to be loved slaves to you to reflect your life and god may you use us our lips our actions lord our conduct our appearance may you use us to spread forth this gospel message may through us lord you may bring more children to the kingdom more members of that body lord that you might complete your body in the form of your bride we're here surrendered to you asking that you take us and use us and have preeminence through us we see our purpose lord all the way back in the beginning what the purpose for the bride was and it continues on but you will fulfill that purpose in this day and we surrender ourselves to you and we're surrendering ourselves to that purpose god we love you have preeminence among us use us for your glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] me
