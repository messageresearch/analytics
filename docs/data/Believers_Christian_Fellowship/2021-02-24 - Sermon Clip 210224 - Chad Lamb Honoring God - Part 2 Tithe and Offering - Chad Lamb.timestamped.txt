[0:00] when i look at malachi chapter 3
[0:03] there's of course there's a rebuke there
[0:05] of course there's a curse there
[0:07] but that's not the part that gets me
[0:08] excited what gets me excited is when he
[0:10] begins in verse 10.
[0:12] god himself what he does is he fills out
[0:15] a contract
[0:17] he takes a contract a binding contract
[0:21] and he lays it right in front of you
[0:25] and he's saying do you want to sign it
[0:31] is that what he's done in malachi he's
[0:34] made himself a
[0:35] binding contract he said prove
[0:39] me see if i won't pour out a blessing
[0:43] that you cannot contain
[0:45] this is a contract friends in this
[0:48] contract
[0:49] in order to seal the contract all you
[0:52] have to do is give the tithe an offering
[0:54] that's your signature on the contract
[0:57] and if you sign this contract god
[1:00] himself
[1:01] has obligated himself to this contract
[1:04] and all you had to do
[1:06] amen in order to initiate the contract
[1:09] and the action
[1:09] was to give the tithe and the offering
[1:11] and when you give the tithe in the
[1:12] offering
[1:13] you put god into action because his word
[1:15] won't fail his promises won't fail amen
[1:18] he will never
[1:18] fail to keep his into the bargain amen
[1:21] and when you give your 10
[1:23] and an offering what you have done you
[1:25] know none of this money is ours
[1:28] we've established that we all understand
[1:30] that we're all in agreement it's not
[1:31] our that god has allowed us energy
[1:33] strength jobs all of these resources so
[1:36] that we can have some goods
[1:37] and then it all comes from god amen it's
[1:39] not ours but god is going to ask us
[1:41] to return unto him a portion to signify
[1:44] that we know where this come from and
[1:46] who he is
[1:46] and that we give honor and respect unto
[1:48] him and in return
[1:50] he says i will let you keep 80 to 90
[1:53] percent
[1:55] depending on how much your offering is
[1:58] i will let you keep the rest
[2:02] but the 10 in the offering you give to
[2:04] me
[2:05] is security against the rest that you
[2:08] won't lose the rest
[2:10] i'll prosper the rest i'll bless the
[2:12] rest i'll grow
[2:13] the rest of it and it's not yours
[2:15] anyways
[2:18] this is the best deal going if you could
[2:20] find a business model like this you
[2:22] would sign people up in droves
[2:25] it can't fail it won't fail it's a
[2:27] promise of god in the word of god and
[2:29] all he's asking for you to do is catch a
[2:31] revelation of who he is
[2:32] and where everything comes from who the
[2:34] creator is and who god is
[2:36] and to acknowledge it amen by signing
[2:39] the contract by getting yourself
[2:41] in contract with god by paying the tithe
[2:44] and the offering
[2:45] and whatever he's allowed you to remain
[2:47] he says now
[2:48] i'll bless it i'll prosper it i'll stop
[2:50] the devourer from taking from it i'll
[2:52] plug your bag with holes in it now
