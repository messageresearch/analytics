TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] when you walk around and everybody's uncertain and unsteady don't forget that you carry a secret in your heart you carry a secret nobody knows billions of people in the earth and nobody knows but you carry a secret that makes you smile you carry a secret that gives you peace you carry a secret that gives you joy in the midst of troubles when you've gotten bad news from work you're still you're still at peace everything's okay you've got a secret of your position in christ you have a secret of who you are amen nobody knows who you are but secretly you know you're the bride of jesus christ you know your position in christ and everything's happening right on time you're carrying a secret it seems unfair when the rest of the world is frightened fearful turmoil and they should be afraid friends you can't look at them and say don't be afraid they ought to be afraid but for you you've got a secret the secret listen the secret of the mystery is your security your security is the secret that you hold in your heart your security is not found in the bank account not in the government is not found your secret your security is the secret that you hold [Music] remember the little washer woman down on the ranch and the armor company the owner's son sent him down and and he come privately to her when nobody else was around he told her that you're going to be my wife and i'm going to come back for you and told her all of these things and you know what he left and every day she was mocked by her cousins she was put down and stepped on she washed the dishes and cleaned the house she didn't get the best of anything she didn't get new clothes best clothes she didn't have anything but she had a secret in her heart [Music] she could sing when she scrubbed the floors she could hum when she washed the dishes when they mocked her and made fun of her she could go back to her room and she could cry tears of joy because she believed what she had been told by her bridegroom and she carried within her a secret that gave her joy in the midst of all the trouble that she was in friends can't we do the same thing can we walk in this life the world is falling apart let it fall apart there's a secret in me there's a secret chamber that i've entered into amen and i know that christ is in this little boat amen and the boat's incapable the boats on the able amen it's beyond the remedy but there's a there's one in the boat that's got the power to get it to the other side and he already prophesied before he got in the boat let's get in this boat and go to the other side and he's already prophesied that he's going to come in this boat and he's going to get this boat to the other side [Music] so i just want to rest with the secret in my heart and have joy when the storms rage i want to hum a little tomb saying all is well all is well little bride all is well
