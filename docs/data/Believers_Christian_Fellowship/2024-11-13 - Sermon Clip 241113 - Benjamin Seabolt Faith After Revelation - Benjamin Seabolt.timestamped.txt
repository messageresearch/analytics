[0:00] when the church goes up Satan goes
[0:06] down that is an event that will
[0:09] happen that can be an event that's
[0:12] happening right now
[0:13] though when you come up in
[0:17] Revelation Satan is cast down I'm going
[0:20] to tell you
[0:22] why it's
[0:24] because the accuser of the Brethren is a
[0:27] title and the scripture that we read at
[0:30] the beginning of the service says that
[0:32] there has to be two witnesses in order
[0:34] for anything to hold up preferably
[0:36] three so when you come up and you do not
[0:39] confess doubt when you do not confess
[0:42] impatience when you do not confess
[0:44] disbelief in God's word the accuser of
[0:47] the Brethren is standing there by
[0:49] himself trying to accuse the brethren in
[0:52] violation of God's
[0:53] law because he's standing by himself his
[0:57] testimony will not hold up right amen
[1:01] there has to be a second
[1:03] testimony that's why I would encourage
[1:05] you do not join him in confessing
[1:09] impatience do not join him in confessing
[1:12] unbelief do not join him in confessing
[1:15] frustration right do not let his
[1:18] accusation hold weight in the court of
[1:21] God's
[1:23] law he has nobody else to help
[1:28] him establish Lish his
[1:32] testimony it has to come off of your
[1:35] lips without it he is kicked out of
[1:37] court it will not hold
[1:39] water
[1:41] right that is an event that will happen
[1:44] in the future literally I believe in the
[1:46] spiritual realm but that's an event
[1:48] that's happening right now in our daily
[1:51] lives do not give the accuser of the
[1:54] Brethren place in your life Saints you
[1:56] have the power to rid him of that
[2:00] position
[2:02] Amen Let Your confession be yay and
[2:06] amen Revelation 12 says and they
[2:08] overcome him by the blood of the lamb
[2:10] and by the word of their
[2:11] testimony and they love their lives not
[2:14] to the
[2:15] death I've read this differently
[2:21] today and they overcome him by the blood
[2:24] of the lamb and by the word of their
[2:25] testimony I've always read that by the
[2:28] word of their test testimony being the
[2:31] group The Bride
[2:32] collectively but I've come to find out
[2:34] that's not how God wants me to read it
[2:37] God wants me to read it that they by the
[2:39] word of their
[2:41] testimony their equals me and
[2:45] God Amen yeah I love you dearly you
[2:50] confess whatever you want to confess my
[2:52] testimony is the word of God and by the
[2:56] blood of the lamb and by their testimony
[3:00] equal sign me and God we will overcome
[3:03] if you want to overcome with us confess
[3:06] what he
[3:08] says but I'm no longer going to take a
[3:11] group mentality towards that scripture I
[3:13] will overcome because I'm not going to
[3:16] confess what Satan confesses I'm going
[3:18] to confess what God has confessed and
[3:21] their testimony mining God's
[3:24] testimony will overcome
