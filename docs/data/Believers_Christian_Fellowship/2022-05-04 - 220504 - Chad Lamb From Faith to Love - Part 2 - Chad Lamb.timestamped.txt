[6:46] [Music]
[6:49] god bless you this evening it's
[6:50] certainly a privilege to be together
[6:52] again
[6:53] before we go to prayer i'd like to just
[6:56] give you an update i had heard that
[6:57] brother everett c was not doing very
[6:59] well he was in very poor health and i
[7:01] just spoke with brother paul just a few
[7:03] minutes ago to get an update and he said
[7:05] brother everett's in the hospital and he
[7:07] had caught an infection a little bit ago
[7:10] and he started declining really really
[7:12] fast with that infection
[7:14] but as many of you know brother everett
[7:16] was diagnosed with dementia some time
[7:18] ago and started declining and after this
[7:20] infection and stay in the hospital they
[7:22] noticed a very very rapid decline
[7:25] and in fact i believe they've called
[7:26] hospice and is that correct brother and
[7:28] so they're not expecting him to make it
[7:30] and so as an assembly i'd just like to
[7:32] pray because our brother's been
[7:33] suffering amen and i hate to see anybody
[7:36] suffer
[7:37] it's it's we're going to ask god to
[7:39] either raise our brother up or take him
[7:41] home
[7:42] amen because what's the long what waits
[7:44] for our brother on the other side is far
[7:46] better than anything that he could ever
[7:47] see again on this side
[7:49] but if god still has a purpose for our
[7:51] brother in this life we're going to ask
[7:53] to raise him up quickly for his sake and
[7:55] his family's sake and if not to let him
[7:57] go on to his reward quickly as well not
[8:00] to linger in between so let's just bow
[8:03] our heads and pray together as an
[8:04] assembly
[8:05] lord jesus we thank you for the
[8:07] privileged lord you've given us of being
[8:09] together again tonight
[8:11] and god our hearts are grieving for our
[8:13] brother everett lord as he is in this
[8:15] declining state and a weakened body that
[8:18] is failing because of the curse
[8:20] but god you have paid the price to
[8:22] reverse the curse lord and in you every
[8:25] promise is available lord and we're just
[8:28] asking god that you would come on the
[8:29] scene and that you would move in one way
[8:31] or the other for our brother
[8:33] god if there's a purpose for our brother
[8:35] i pray that you'd raise him up lord god
[8:37] if there's something more for him to do
[8:38] i'd pray that you would rapidly turn the
[8:40] situation around and restore him nor not
[8:42] just to health but restore his mind all
[8:44] those also to health
[8:46] my god if our brother has served his
[8:48] purpose on this life we pray that you'd
[8:50] allow him to go on to his reward and to
[8:52] his rest may he gather with the saints
[8:55] on the other side and rejoice in that
[8:57] place that your prophet tried to
[8:58] describe to us lord and while we're just
[9:01] praying that you would touch the family
[9:03] give them strength give them courage be
[9:05] a very present help in the time of
[9:07] trouble to them comfort them lord
[9:09] comfort his wife and his children lord
[9:11] and i pray that you give them wisdom if
[9:13] they have to make any kind of decisions
[9:15] that your presence lord would lead and
[9:17] guide them every step
[9:19] and god we love you and we love our
[9:21] brother and we thankful lord for his
[9:23] life and we just pray that you would do
[9:25] what's best for him in jesus christ's
[9:28] name we pray
[9:29] amen
[9:31] amen god bless you well we're standing
[9:33] if we could turn to the book of
[9:34] colossians we'll begin reading from
[9:37] colossians chapter 1.
[9:40] so god bless you brother keith sister
[9:43] lee it's good to see you guys back we
[9:44] knew you were coming back to help sister
[9:46] nancy but it's good to see you here and
[9:48] god bless you for that amen
[9:50] let's look in colossians chapter 1 verse
[9:53] 3.
[9:56] and we're going to continue on in the
[9:58] same subject so if we can pull up that
[10:00] first powerpoint well this is going to
[10:01] be from faith to love part two
[10:04] and we're going to begin reading in
[10:06] colossians chapter 1 verse 3.
[10:09] we give thanks to god and the father of
[10:11] our lord jesus christ praying always for
[10:13] you
[10:14] since we heard of your faith in christ
[10:16] jesus and of the love which you have to
[10:19] all saints
[10:20] i think this is a wonderful scripture
[10:22] he's commending them for their faith
[10:23] which is the foundation faith you have
[10:25] in jesus christ and the love do you have
[10:28] for saints which is brotherly love all
[10:29] the way at the top next to the capstone
[10:32] so you see a church in colossians being
[10:34] commended by the first church age
[10:36] messenger that they
[10:38] have an expression of christ in their
[10:40] midst amen god bless you as you're
[10:42] seated
[10:44] while you have your bibles open i want
[10:46] to read several scriptures as we begin
[10:48] let's turn together to ephesians we just
[10:51] go
[10:51] back a couple of books
[10:54] to ephesians chapter one i'm going to
[10:56] read three scriptures in a row just as a
[10:59] refresher and then we're going to
[11:01] continue on ephesians chapter 1
[11:05] and verse 4.
[11:09] according as he hath chosen us in him
[11:12] before the foundation of the world that
[11:13] we should be holy and without blame
[11:16] before him in love
[11:17] having predestinated us unto the
[11:20] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[11:22] himself according to the good pleasure
[11:24] of his will
[11:26] the most wonderful thing
[11:28] that we can know is that god
[11:30] predestinated us amen
[11:32] according to the good pleasure of his
[11:33] will
[11:34] but he didn't just predestinate us to be
[11:36] his child he predestinated us into the
[11:39] adoption of children so he has
[11:41] predestinated us into maturity and to
[11:44] placing amen
[11:46] remember that we've come to this earth
[11:47] to serve his purpose and there's a
[11:49] purpose for each one of us so we haven't
[11:51] just come to this earth to spend time on
[11:54] this earth we've come to serve some
[11:56] purpose in the kingdom of god so he
[11:58] predestinated us unto adoption amen
[12:01] predestination is unto the placing of
[12:03] sluns which you place at a certain level
[12:05] of maturity so god didn't just save you
[12:09] amen so that you could just uh you know
[12:12] say i'm saved and that's it but there
[12:13] was a purpose behind it all amen
[12:16] and that's the thing that gives us so
[12:17] much courage is god will complete the
[12:19] work that he's begun because he purposed
[12:22] for us to do something in this life to
[12:24] serve a purpose to take our position in
[12:26] the body of christ to do something in
[12:28] the kingdom of god and so god has
[12:31] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[12:34] children let's go
[12:36] to the previous book to galatians
[12:39] chapter four
[12:40] we'll pick up one scripture there in
[12:42] galatians chapter four
[12:46] verse six
[12:48] galatians four six and because you are
[12:50] sons god has sent forth the spirit of
[12:53] his son into your hearts crying abba
[12:56] father
[12:57] so we receive the spirit of his son the
[13:00] spirit of jesus christ and our hearts
[13:01] crying out of a father why because you
[13:04] are sons
[13:05] because you already were a son you
[13:07] receive the spirit of the son where you
[13:09] cry abba father
[13:11] amen let's go to the previous book to
[13:13] romans or a couple books ahead to romans
[13:18] chapter 8.
[13:20] and we'll read one more portion of
[13:21] scripture romans chapter 8
[13:26] and verse 14.
[13:28] romans 8
[13:29] and 14.
[13:31] for as many years are led by the spirit
[13:33] of god they are the sons of god for you
[13:36] have not received the spirit of bondage
[13:38] again to fear but you have received the
[13:40] spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba
[13:43] father
[13:44] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[13:46] our spirit that we are the children of
[13:49] god
[13:50] and because you are sons
[13:52] he gave you the spirit of his son
[13:55] amen
[13:56] and we have received the spirit
[13:58] of adoption so what is that spirit that
[14:01] we received it's the spirit of adoption
[14:02] the spirit that will take us to adoption
[14:04] because we've been predestinated to the
[14:06] adoption of children by jesus christ so
[14:09] all these scriptures paint the same
[14:10] picture when we start talking about the
[14:13] virtues and we start talking about the
[14:14] stature of a perfect man
[14:16] if we don't set the foundation right in
[14:18] the word it can become a discouraging
[14:20] conversation because we begin to look at
[14:23] these virtues and say well i mean i've
[14:25] got to measure up to all of this and
[14:27] i've got to add to this to this to this
[14:29] to this but if we don't have the basis
[14:31] of understanding we can get discouraged
[14:34] when there's nothing discouraging in
[14:36] this doctrine whatsoever
[14:38] amen this message did not come to
[14:40] discourage us this message came to give
[14:41] us life this message didn't come to push
[14:44] us away it came to put us in position
[14:46] amen so everything in this message came
[14:48] to unlock our understanding to bring us
[14:51] into our rightful position so there's
[14:53] nothing discouraging in the message amen
[14:56] if the message is presented in a
[14:58] discouraging way it's the wrong ankle
[15:00] preached the wrong way amen and
[15:03] trying to make you the wrong recipient
[15:05] amen but if you're the bride of jesus
[15:07] christ this message came to lift you up
[15:09] and to put you in position to manifest
[15:12] the life of jesus christ and that was
[15:14] according to his purpose and his will
[15:16] not your purpose and not your will so
[15:18] you've been predestinated to make it to
[15:21] the statue of a perfect man
[15:25] now that begins to to flip the whole
[15:27] idea on its head and take it out of our
[15:29] carnal mind and it becomes an exciting
[15:31] doctrine because now this is me amen
[15:34] this is what i am this is who god wants
[15:36] me to be this is what i've been birthed
[15:39] on this earth to express amen it's all
[15:42] mine by these promises by these precious
[15:45] prominence i've been made a partaker of
[15:47] the divine nature so i can partake of
[15:49] this divine nature and become the very
[15:52] thing that i'm looking at and that was
[15:54] god's purpose from before the foundation
[15:56] of the world there's no discouragement
[15:58] here there's only encouragement saying
[16:00] this is you keep climbing amen this is
[16:03] you keep climbing where am i going to
[16:05] stop i'm not going to stop i'm going all
[16:07] the way to the top to express the full
[16:09] life of jesus christ because that's why
[16:12] i was put on this earth and that's why i
[16:14] was born again by the spirit of god
[16:17] amen like we said
[16:19] sunday everything in this world that's
[16:21] birthed his birth to reflect the thing
[16:23] that birthed it
[16:25] and we've been birthed by the spirit of
[16:26] god to reflect god amen
[16:29] so that's our purpose that's why we are
[16:31] here
[16:32] amen we'll take a look at the powerpoint
[16:34] here
[16:36] and in the beginning of stature of
[16:37] perfect man brother benham sets the
[16:39] whole stage the whole tone the whole
[16:41] purpose of the of the sermon he's going
[16:43] to preach he said this morning we want
[16:44] to speak on the subject or teach rather
[16:46] if we can building the living tabernacle
[16:49] building the building the living
[16:50] tabernacle the living god's dwelling
[16:52] place the perfect man the living
[16:55] tabernacle of the living god where he
[16:57] dwells so that's the subject that we're
[16:59] talking about is the dwelling place of
[17:01] god
[17:04] in second peter chapter one whereby are
[17:06] given unto us exceeding great and
[17:08] precious promises
[17:10] that by these promises now listen
[17:13] already in the in the very first verse
[17:15] that we're reading here in verse five
[17:17] whereby are given unto us given unto us
[17:20] not required of us
[17:23] given unto us
[17:26] exceeding great and precious promises so
[17:29] god has given exceeding great and
[17:31] precious promises unto us
[17:33] that by these the exceeding great
[17:35] promises we might be partakers of the
[17:37] divine nature
[17:39] having escaped having already escaped
[17:42] the corruption that is in the world
[17:43] through lust by what being being born
[17:45] again by the spirit of god now we've
[17:47] already escaped the corruption that is
[17:49] in the world through lust we've received
[17:51] he's given to us great and precious
[17:52] promises that by these we may be
[17:54] partakers of the divine nature amen
[17:57] praise god how can we fail
[18:00] just partake amen we're supposed to
[18:03] partake just take it in just receive the
[18:06] promises take in the divine nature and
[18:08] become what god has called for us to
[18:11] become
[18:13] he says
[18:14] in verse five and beside this giving all
[18:16] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[18:19] divert your knowledge into knowledge
[18:21] temperance and to temperance patience
[18:23] and to patience godliness and to
[18:26] godliness brotherly kindness and the
[18:28] brotherly kindness charity whenever you
[18:30] see the word charity it's the word love
[18:33] agape love
[18:35] and so these are where brother branham
[18:37] draws out of this and preaches on the
[18:38] seven virtues
[18:40] and he goes into a statue of a perfect
[18:42] man but he says now remember the black
[18:44] bird with peacock feathers
[18:46] don't forget him see don't try to add
[18:49] it till you're actually born again
[18:52] because if you won't work you can't make
[18:54] it work it'll come to this or this here
[18:56] it'll crumble somewhere but when you get
[18:58] down here a genuine born-again dove then
[19:01] you don't add nothing it adds to you
[19:05] comes on up all right coming into
[19:07] perfection now
[19:09] so
[19:10] you don't you don't have to i've got to
[19:13] do this and you know it's not like every
[19:16] level we come to i've got a three-step
[19:18] plan for going from faith to virtue
[19:22] amen virtue is already in the seed
[19:25] it's the life it's the word it's the
[19:27] light of the hour that is drawing the
[19:29] nature out of the seed amen
[19:32] everything has already been provided to
[19:34] us
[19:35] brother brahm says when you're a
[19:36] christian you just bear the fruit of the
[19:38] spirit you don't manufacture it
[19:40] you don't try to make it up you don't
[19:42] make yourself something that you're not
[19:44] you just become what you're supposed to
[19:46] be and then it takes care of itself
[19:49] amen
[19:50] he goes on to say and in the same
[19:52] message statue of a perfect man well now
[19:55] that's the way it is try
[19:57] trying to manufacture christianity you
[19:59] can't do it the first thing you've got
[20:01] to do is be born again you've got to be
[20:04] changed and when you're changed you
[20:06] become a new creature now you're getting
[20:09] right now see now you don't have to
[20:11] worry about the feathers it'll take care
[20:13] of itself when you're born again
[20:15] so you don't have to worry about a dove
[20:17] putting forth dove feathers he was
[20:18] talking about a buzzer taking dove
[20:20] feathers amen and plucking them in
[20:22] themselves he said that's just a
[20:24] hypocrite that's like you trying to have
[20:26] virtues
[20:28] i'm trying to have if you say i'm trying
[20:31] to have brotherly kindness oh brother
[20:34] you're going to fail if you're trying to
[20:35] have brotherly kindness you're destined
[20:37] to fail amen it's got to be something
[20:39] that comes from the inside out amen
[20:42] that's the reality that's the real
[20:47] now in the message blasphemous names he
[20:49] says you cannot join the church of the
[20:51] living god you're borned into it by the
[20:53] baptism of the holy ghost and when
[20:55] you're baptized with the holy ghost
[20:57] these virtues are sealed in you by the
[20:59] holy ghost so he's been teaching us and
[21:01] we've been talking about this for the
[21:02] last uh two services that he begins with
[21:06] the baptism of the holy ghost as a new
[21:08] birth amen and it's the baptism of the
[21:10] holy ghost that raises you all the way
[21:12] up into the very image of the one that
[21:14] birthed you amen it brings you all the
[21:16] way up into the image of christ it's the
[21:18] holy ghost down here it's the holy ghost
[21:20] in every stage and it's the holy ghost
[21:22] up here
[21:23] amen
[21:25] we showed this picture last time and uh
[21:28] this looks like a capstone but really a
[21:30] prism is a three corner to a three-sided
[21:32] piece of glass and then it takes light
[21:35] and it breaks it into the full light
[21:36] spectrum or the seven colors of the
[21:38] rainbow amen and and so the seven colors
[21:42] of the rainbow together are white light
[21:45] amen white light separated is seven
[21:47] colors and brother brandon talks about
[21:49] this and and we use this picture to
[21:51] depict this because he starts talking
[21:53] about the life of christ through seven
[21:55] church ages and when he builds the
[21:56] pyramid he shows seven church ages seven
[21:59] messengers and seven h's and also seven
[22:01] virtues and he says the way he builds
[22:03] his church is the way he builds the
[22:05] individual
[22:06] and so what is it this hovering over
[22:09] this this god amen the the the life of
[22:12] christ amen it has all of these virtues
[22:16] in it
[22:18] so from the beginning it's building all
[22:20] the way back to the image of christ amen
[22:23] and it's christ drawing the life unto
[22:26] himself
[22:27] all seven virtues are what the divine
[22:30] nature
[22:31] the life of christ
[22:34] so when we started our pyramid we
[22:36] started at the top with love
[22:39] we've always like i said before we've
[22:41] always drawn it from the bottom we've
[22:42] always talked about it from the bottom
[22:44] but if there is no top there is no
[22:46] bottom amen
[22:48] if there's no love of god if there's no
[22:50] holy ghost if there's no life of christ
[22:52] drawing us amen there's no starting
[22:54] there's nothing going to happen amen
[22:56] this has to be first amen when this is
[22:59] first it births us into the program of
[23:01] god and draws us up to itself
[23:06] it says
[23:07] building this monument
[23:08] building this stature see it starts off
[23:11] with the foundation stone faith virtue
[23:13] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[23:15] brotherly kindness now what does it do
[23:18] then they're waiting for the headstone
[23:19] which is love for god is love and he
[23:22] controls and is the strength of every
[23:24] one of these things
[23:26] he controls every one of those virtues
[23:29] and he is the strength of every one of
[23:30] these virtues
[23:32] that's right
[23:33] yes sir right in here right in there you
[23:36] see i got in between all these works in
[23:38] here and here these little waves come
[23:40] what is it the holy ghost coming down
[23:43] through christ see holy spirit the holy
[23:45] spirit is above all this welding this
[23:48] together
[23:49] welding a lot a perfect church for the
[23:51] capstone to cap it off so the holy ghost
[23:54] is above all of this amen what's he
[23:56] doing he's building
[23:58] what were you birthed for to be built
[24:01] into the image of jesus christ that's
[24:03] what you rebirth for who's doing the
[24:05] work the holy ghost is working in your
[24:07] life and building you into the image of
[24:09] jesus christ
[24:11] so what do we do
[24:13] yield amen
[24:14] surrender
[24:16] give up
[24:17] because he's a master builder and he
[24:18] knows what he's doing
[24:21] so we talked about faith being the
[24:23] foundation of our lives the faith
[24:25] foundation of our christian walk
[24:27] and ephesians 2 8 says for by grace are
[24:29] you saved through faith and that none of
[24:31] yourselves it is the gift of god
[24:34] in galatians 5 6 it says for in jesus
[24:37] christ there is neither circumcision
[24:38] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[24:41] faith which worketh by love
[24:44] all of these things you'll find work by
[24:46] love
[24:47] it's the love of god because god is love
[24:50] amen and god is working this in our
[24:53] lives
[24:55] why it was his purpose from before the
[24:56] foundation of the world
[24:58] notice you must be born again
[25:01] and when you're born again you can't be
[25:02] born again without having faith that's
[25:05] right so you see on my chart here i got
[25:06] the very foundation faith is the
[25:08] foundation of all of it for without
[25:10] faith it is impossible to please god he
[25:13] that cometh to god must believe that he
[25:15] is and a rewarder of those that
[25:16] diligently seek him
[25:19] amen so we know that faith also has a
[25:21] resting place
[25:23] and the resting place of faith is on the
[25:25] word of god amen and faith cometh by
[25:27] hearing by hearing the word amen so
[25:30] faith has a resting place our faith has
[25:32] a resting place and our resting place is
[25:34] on the word of god then faith becomes
[25:36] our foundation but we're established on
[25:39] the rock of god's word amen and then
[25:41] faith in that word brings our salvation
[25:44] [Music]
[25:45] now the next one was virtue and virtue
[25:48] here in stature of a perfect man he says
[25:49] well if i'm going to be like jesus i've
[25:52] got to have virtue and a past that it
[25:54] can pass forward from me to people
[25:57] that's an important statement
[26:00] he said if i'm going to be like jesus
[26:03] if i'm going to be like jesus i've got
[26:05] to have virtue and brother of him tells
[26:06] his virtue with strength for when the
[26:08] woman touched the hymn of his garment
[26:09] virtue left him he said i felt virtue go
[26:11] out
[26:12] and he said it pass and a past that it
[26:15] can pass forward from me to the people
[26:18] because virtue went out of him to the
[26:19] people virtue and before you can let it
[26:22] out you've got to have it first
[26:24] you haven't got it it won't come out
[26:26] there's nothing for it to come out of
[26:28] what if someone tried to draw virtue out
[26:30] of us and the check would return
[26:31] insufficient funds
[26:33] so we find out that god wants to build
[26:35] enough strength he wants us to be
[26:37] established strong strong enough to
[26:39] stand on our foundation of faith now god
[26:42] by his grace amen he quickened to us
[26:44] faith we believe the word of god and by
[26:46] the revelation of god and we need some
[26:49] strength to stand but this virtue is not
[26:51] just enough strength to stand it's
[26:54] enough strength for somebody to draw
[26:56] strength from us amen so if we're going
[26:57] to be like jesus we need virtue enough
[27:00] to stand the trial stand the test stand
[27:03] as a christian but also for somebody
[27:05] else to be able to tap in and pull
[27:07] virtue from us
[27:09] this is going to take a work of the holy
[27:11] ghost amen this is not trying harder and
[27:13] trying to be stronger amen you'll fail
[27:15] you'll fail you'll fail but we need
[27:17] virtue that comes from the holy ghost
[27:21] amen
[27:22] i want to look turn with me to to
[27:25] second peter or yeah ii peter
[27:30] i want to look at something here
[27:39] we just read on the overhead about the
[27:41] virtue starting from verse five to verse
[27:43] seven and verse seven ends with
[27:45] brotherly kindness and then the charity
[27:48] and verse 8 says for if these things be
[27:50] in you
[27:51] and the bound
[27:53] they make you that you shall neither be
[27:54] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[27:56] of the lord jesus christ
[27:58] so remember the analogy brother branham
[28:00] gives us of the of the boy who's growing
[28:02] up in his father's house and the father
[28:04] wants to establish him in the family
[28:06] business and give him responsibility
[28:08] amen and so he puts him under tutors and
[28:10] governors and he's typing that with us
[28:13] under the holy ghost growing us up amen
[28:16] and he's growing us up to be in the
[28:18] image of his father and he's bringing
[28:19] him to a certain measure of
[28:22] of wholeness a certain measure of
[28:24] maturity where he can say now he's a
[28:26] mature son and he takes that mature son
[28:29] at whatever age that would be deemed
[28:31] amen still a young man amen and he
[28:33] bestows upon him privilege and
[28:35] responsibility and now he's working in
[28:38] the kingdom like his father's working in
[28:40] the kingdom
[28:41] now now he's given responsibility amen
[28:44] but the father doesn't expect that all
[28:47] of his growing will stop right there
[28:49] he's just come to maturity and been
[28:51] placed as a son in the in the economy in
[28:54] the kingdom of the father and he's given
[28:56] responsibility and privileges but he's
[28:58] still going to grow into the likeness of
[29:00] the father because the father is more
[29:01] mature yet
[29:03] so that's for us amen there's a certain
[29:06] level of these virtues that begin to
[29:08] grow in us amen to bring us to a certain
[29:10] maturity so that god can use us now in
[29:13] the work that he has for us to do in
[29:14] this earth but i don't believe that's
[29:16] the end of our understanding about god
[29:18] or growing into the likeness of christ i
[29:20] believe i'm still growing into the
[29:21] likeness of christ
[29:24] do you
[29:25] if not god never be able to use us we'll
[29:27] be at the point of death and say now i'm
[29:29] ready and then we're gone amen but
[29:31] there's a certain level of maturity
[29:32] where we come to as a christian and he
[29:34] says now he i can give him
[29:36] responsibility now he can work in my
[29:38] kingdom but we're still growing so if
[29:41] these things be in you and abound
[29:44] so they can be in you but they can also
[29:46] abound and i'm saying hey i may have
[29:50] some temperance but i want it to abound
[29:52] amen i may have a little virtue but i
[29:54] want it to abound i may recognize that
[29:56] god's given me patience that i've never
[29:58] had before but i want it to abound amen
[30:01] i'm not stopping amen just because i
[30:03] believe god amen has placed me and i
[30:06] believe i know what the lord wants me to
[30:07] do with my life amen i'm not stopping i
[30:10] want all of these things to abound
[30:13] that's why as we begin to preach on this
[30:15] amen the devil can begin to play in your
[30:18] mind because you can be able to see oh i
[30:20] don't have enough temperatures i need
[30:21] more temperatures i must not be a mature
[30:24] sign god must not be able to use me you
[30:26] may have a temperance but you need some
[30:28] abounding amen
[30:30] you can go back to the lord and say lord
[30:32] i need more amen
[30:34] i need more i need more temperance i
[30:36] need more virtue i need more
[30:38] whatever you find you're struggling with
[30:40] as we go through this just ask for more
[30:42] because these things can be in you
[30:44] and abound
[30:46] amen
[30:52] then we come to knowledge
[30:54] the third step
[30:56] is knowledge
[30:57] and you can see
[30:59] as we begin to climb in these virtues
[31:02] amen it begins to take shape amen your
[31:05] life begins to start to reflect
[31:06] something the thing that you're pointed
[31:08] to you begin to look more like christ
[31:10] and act more like christ and it becomes
[31:12] more visible on the outside that's what
[31:15] happens as we mature
[31:16] amen many times when we start our walk
[31:19] with the lord amen it's not as if
[31:23] it's not as if immediately everything is
[31:26] changed and all of a sudden we come out
[31:27] acting exactly like jesus christ no we
[31:29] have to be patient with one another
[31:31] because we all have to grow up
[31:34] we're birthed amen but we're a newborn
[31:36] baby christian and newborn baby
[31:38] christians still get a lot of things
[31:39] wrong amen they still may have rough
[31:42] edges they still may have a bit of a
[31:43] temper you can have a newborn baby
[31:45] christian and he can still tell you off
[31:49] and you thought i thought you told me
[31:50] you were born again
[31:53] but maybe he's just a newborn baby
[31:55] christian that's got to grow up amen
[31:57] that needs to grow into temperance amen
[32:00] and we've got to be patient with one
[32:02] another
[32:03] not cut somebody out every time they do
[32:05] something wrong
[32:07] because if that would have happened to
[32:08] us we would never be where we're at now
[32:10] we'd be gone
[32:12] amen
[32:13] so in knowledge he says and thirdly you
[32:16] add knowledge knowledge now that don't
[32:18] mean worldly knowledge because that's
[32:20] foolishness to god
[32:22] but you know but knowledge to judge
[32:24] judge what right from wrong how do you
[32:26] judge it then if you've got
[32:28] christian knowledge with your virtue and
[32:30] faith you judge whether the word is
[32:32] right or wrong and if you can lay aside
[32:34] all your creeds and all your unbelief
[32:36] and everything that you claim to have
[32:37] done then you have knowledge to believe
[32:39] that god cannot lie
[32:41] let every man's word be a lie but mind
[32:43] be true see now you're getting knowledge
[32:45] that supreme knowledge you don't have to
[32:48] have four degrees in some college or
[32:50] something like that to have it because
[32:52] all these virtues are given to you by
[32:54] god
[32:55] so where do these virtues come from from
[32:57] god
[33:00] to place upon the foundation of your
[33:02] faith
[33:03] that you might come to the full stature
[33:05] of a real living man of god yes sir and
[33:08] add knowledge because knowledge of his
[33:11] word
[33:13] we read these two scriptures on sunday
[33:15] second corinthians 4 6 for god who
[33:17] commanded the light to shine out of
[33:19] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[33:22] give the light of the knowledge of the
[33:24] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[33:27] we begin to talk about on sunday that
[33:29] god wants us to know him amen
[33:33] god there's things god wants us to know
[33:35] that's why he put a bible in writing so
[33:37] we could read it it's not that i just
[33:39] you know i just want to love the lord
[33:41] and i want to be in a love relationship
[33:43] with the lord and i want to float around
[33:44] saying i love god and he loves me but
[33:46] god wants you to know him amen he wants
[33:49] you to really love him for who he is not
[33:52] for your idea of what he is
[33:55] so god wants to be known so he gives us
[33:57] his word and then he sent a prophet to
[33:59] unlock the mystery that was in the back
[34:01] part of his mind because god wants us to
[34:03] have knowledge of him and he even sent
[34:06] jesus christ and jesus christ was a
[34:09] fleshly reflection of an invisible god
[34:11] so that god would be more known to the
[34:13] human race
[34:14] because god wants to be known so this
[34:16] kind of godly holy ghost knowledge god
[34:18] wants us to know his word so we know him
[34:21] amen so that we can really truly begin
[34:23] to love him not just love our idea of
[34:26] him
[34:28] so as we mature god gives us some
[34:30] strength and then he gives us that
[34:32] knowledge so that we can be established
[34:34] and also so that we're not like children
[34:36] tossed to and fro by every wind of
[34:37] doctrine so that we don't you know
[34:40] because every time you know you hear
[34:42] dynamic anointed preaching it doesn't
[34:44] always mean they're telling the truth
[34:47] there's more than one kind of anointing
[34:49] amen so it can be really exciting and it
[34:51] can be thrilling and you can say that's
[34:53] wonderful and we accept this and we go
[34:55] down this path then somebody comes with
[34:57] more thrilling more exciting message and
[34:59] we drop that and we come to this god
[35:01] doesn't want us to be tossed around by
[35:03] that he wants us to be established on
[35:05] the word and give us holy ghost
[35:06] knowledge so that we know him and we
[35:09] know his word and we can be further
[35:11] established amen
[35:12] and grow more into his image and more to
[35:15] his likeness
[35:17] in ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 he says
[35:20] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[35:22] the father of glory may give unto you
[35:24] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[35:27] the knowledge of him
[35:29] the eyes of your understanding being
[35:31] enlightened that you may know what is
[35:32] the hope of his calling and what is the
[35:34] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[35:37] in the saints
[35:39] not to the saints
[35:43] that you might know the riches of the
[35:44] glory of his inheritance
[35:46] in the saints
[35:48] god wants us to come to a supreme
[35:50] knowledge
[35:53] he says i believe in genuine holy ghost
[35:56] knowledge holy ghost knowledge will
[35:58] always punctuate the word with amen when
[36:00] you get these things that seem to
[36:02] contradict themselves in the bible
[36:04] now i don't want to add to what brother
[36:05] bram said but let's take it also for the
[36:07] message
[36:08] in the bible and in the message when you
[36:10] get these things that seem to contradict
[36:12] themselves in the bible you sit down and
[36:14] study it and prayerfully like that and
[36:17] the first thing you know the holy spirit
[36:19] begins to move in after a while you see
[36:22] it ties together and there you got it
[36:24] see that's
[36:25] knowledge
[36:27] amen
[36:28] it's holy ghost knowledge where it seems
[36:30] to be a contradiction there's a truth
[36:32] laying there
[36:34] where it seems to be a contradiction to
[36:37] opposing things in the bible or in the
[36:38] message there's a truth theory man so
[36:41] let's just pray about it until the holy
[36:43] ghost moves in and begins to tie the
[36:44] thing together and we can see the whole
[36:46] truth and it'll fit the whole picture of
[36:48] the bible
[36:49] it won't be one isolated little nugget
[36:51] dropped in there that doesn't match the
[36:52] rest of the picture but when the holy
[36:54] ghost comes in with holy ghost knowledge
[36:56] all of a sudden that revelation will fit
[36:58] the whole picture
[37:01] amen
[37:02] and then temperance this is where we
[37:04] finished
[37:05] this on sunday temperance means
[37:07] self-control
[37:09] the virtue of one who has mastered his
[37:11] desires and passions especially his
[37:13] sensual appetites
[37:15] and so when we grow
[37:17] we need self-control amen we need to
[37:20] control this outer man that we dwell in
[37:24] so so you know the word the bible told
[37:26] us that we're taught how to possess how
[37:28] we ought to possess our vessels and so
[37:30] temperance will help us possess our
[37:32] vessels
[37:34] and brother bam says the word temperance
[37:37] doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here
[37:39] either no no temperance doesn't mean
[37:40] alcoholic cure not in this case this is
[37:43] bible temperance holy spirit temperance
[37:46] that's just one of the lust of the flesh
[37:48] he's talking about drinking but we're
[37:50] talking about the holy spirit temperance
[37:52] that means how to control your tongue
[37:54] not to be a tattler how to control your
[37:56] temper not to fly off every time anybody
[37:59] speaks cross to you oh my
[38:02] boy a lot of us going to fall off before
[38:04] we get started aren't we
[38:06] then we wonder why god is not in his
[38:07] church doing miracles and things that he
[38:09] used to do yes sir see
[38:11] add these things add temperance to it
[38:15] old temperance how to answer in kindness
[38:17] when wrath has spoken to you
[38:19] somebody say you bunch of holy rollers
[38:21] down there don't jump out and roll up
[38:23] your sleeves now not that but talk with
[38:25] godly love temperance kindness is that
[38:27] the way you want to be
[38:29] when you're riled upon rile not back let
[38:32] him be your example
[38:33] when they said if thou be the son of god
[38:35] turn these stones into bread you he
[38:37] could have done it and showed he was god
[38:39] but he had temperance when they called
[38:41] him beelzebub he said i'll forgive you
[38:43] for him that's right they pulled
[38:45] handfuls of beard out of his face and
[38:46] spit in his face and said come down off
[38:48] the cross he said father forgive them
[38:51] they don't even know what they're doing
[38:53] see after you've come to knowledge
[38:56] then you come to temperance where you
[38:57] can now control yourself and you can
[38:59] control yourself because you have a
[39:01] greater understanding
[39:04] you know i was sharing with some
[39:06] brothers recently you know in psalms 27
[39:10] in psalms 27 david is talking about thou
[39:13] has set me upon a rock
[39:16] and we know a rock is revelation so
[39:19] david was surrounded by his enemies amen
[39:22] but his victory was going to be that god
[39:24] set him up on a rock not that he climbed
[39:26] up on a rock but that god set him upon
[39:28] iraq so god put him based him on a
[39:30] revelation
[39:32] and he says and my head has been lifted
[39:36] above the head of my enemies
[39:38] so what does that mean that means his
[39:40] understanding his revelation
[39:42] his knowledge is lifted above the head
[39:44] of his enemies and now david doesn't
[39:46] have to fight everybody david doesn't
[39:49] have to go tis for tat an eye for eye
[39:51] and this and that because his head has
[39:54] been lifted above everybody he's set
[39:56] upon a rock he has greater understanding
[39:58] and he can be like jesus christ sitting
[40:01] nailed to a cross that father forgive
[40:03] them they don't know what they do how
[40:04] could he said that because he had
[40:06] supreme knowledge he knew the plan of
[40:08] god and he knew that they don't know
[40:10] what they're doing if they knew what
[40:12] they were doing they wouldn't be doing
[40:14] this
[40:16] and when we come to that kind of
[40:17] knowledge on the word and understanding
[40:20] of who we are and what we're here for
[40:22] and what god's doing amen when when
[40:24] somebody begins to mistreat or be unkind
[40:27] or speak evil all of a sudden you can
[40:29] realize they don't understand
[40:31] if they understood amen that's why you
[40:34] know parents can manage children because
[40:36] they know the child doesn't understand
[40:38] they have to manage for their behavior
[40:40] and watch after them and and you know
[40:42] they can spank a little child and the
[40:44] child can turn around and say i hate you
[40:47] it may sting for a minute but they know
[40:49] they don't understand mom doesn't say
[40:51] well i hate you back
[40:55] why because of her knowledge
[40:59] we understand
[41:01] they don't mean it
[41:03] they don't know what we know
[41:05] we can have the same kind of temperance
[41:08] when we come to
[41:09] the correct understanding
[41:11] they don't know what we know
[41:13] they don't understand if they understood
[41:14] they wouldn't say those things
[41:18] amen
[41:20] to be like jesus
[41:22] said when he had the gift he knowed all
[41:24] things for in him was the fullness of
[41:26] the godhead bodily they had seen him
[41:28] perform miracles by telling people what
[41:29] was wrong with them and so forth like
[41:31] that they put a rag around his head like
[41:33] that around his eyes and hit him on the
[41:35] head with a stick and said prophesy tell
[41:37] us who hit you will believe you he had
[41:40] temperance
[41:41] now if you've got it like that add it to
[41:43] your faith
[41:45] if you still blow up and sass and fuss
[41:47] and stew and carry on
[41:49] you ain't got no you you can't add that
[41:51] because it won't add
[41:53] it won't vulcanize you couldn't you
[41:55] couldn't take a piece of rubber you know
[41:57] and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it
[41:58] just won't work no it's got to be
[42:00] flexible just like the rubber is and
[42:02] when you when you when your faith and
[42:04] your temperance becomes the same kind of
[42:06] holy ghost temperance that he had then
[42:08] it will vulcanize with him you're added
[42:11] to it
[42:12] so it's got to be the right kind of
[42:14] temperance this is not uh self-control
[42:16] in the way of like we said before you
[42:19] know grit your teeth count to ten take
[42:21] five deep breaths that's not
[42:22] self-control
[42:24] but temperance is an inner man
[42:26] controlling the outer man
[42:28] temperance is the inner man that's been
[42:31] born again by the spirit finally coming
[42:33] to a level of understanding and maturing
[42:34] where he says okay black dog back a
[42:37] little bit
[42:38] jerk that chain back and say you're not
[42:40] running the show
[42:42] i'm in control you're not chasing after
[42:45] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and
[42:48] pride of life we're not going down that
[42:50] road we don't want those things we're
[42:52] going to turn our head
[42:54] and then we're not going to partake of
[42:55] that we're not going to blow up when
[42:57] somebody says something to us because
[42:59] the inner man is now controlling the
[43:00] outer man that's real holy ghost
[43:02] temperance
[43:04] amen
[43:06] now let's move on
[43:07] to the fifth which is patience
[43:10] i had fun with this one
[43:12] uh
[43:14] it was it was really interesting we look
[43:15] at patients
[43:18] patience is this word here patience but
[43:20] when i get down to the description
[43:22] at the bottom it says steadfastness
[43:24] constancy endurance
[43:27] in the new testament the characteristic
[43:29] of a man who has not swerved from his
[43:31] deliberate purpose and is loyal to the
[43:33] faith and piety by even the greatest
[43:35] trials and sufferings patiently and
[43:38] steadfastly this is patience
[43:41] now you can see why patience and
[43:43] temperance are two different things
[43:44] they're not the same temperance is
[43:46] self-control
[43:48] patience is the ability to endure
[43:52] patience is the ability to hold fast and
[43:55] endure and not budge
[43:58] that is patience
[44:02] in james chapter 1 verse 2
[44:05] says my brethren count it all joy when
[44:07] you fall untied
[44:09] diverse temptations that were
[44:10] temptations means trials or testings
[44:14] knowing this that the trying of your
[44:16] faith worketh patience
[44:18] but let patience have a perfect work
[44:20] that you may be perfect and entire
[44:22] wanting nothing
[44:24] so patience will perform a good work
[44:27] amen and the trying of your faith work
[44:29] is patience so how do i get more
[44:31] patience by the trying of your faith
[44:34] so what's building patience in me
[44:36] tests temptations manifold temptations
[44:40] many different diverse temptations and
[44:42] trials they're working in us patience
[44:45] but patience will bring us to a perfect
[44:47] man
[44:50] it says patience with what what kind of
[44:52] patience
[44:53] first thing is to have patience with god
[44:56] this is what surprised me when i began
[44:58] to look at this the first thing you have
[45:00] to have is you have to have patience
[45:02] with god
[45:03] he said if you've got real genuine faith
[45:06] you'll have real genuine patience
[45:08] because faith work is patience when god
[45:11] says anything you believe it that's all
[45:13] you got patience say well i asked him
[45:15] last night to heal me and i'm just as
[45:17] sick this morning oh my what patience
[45:20] god told abraham and 25 years later
[45:23] there wasn't even one sign he was still
[45:25] believing he was patient with god
[45:29] brother i said the first thing you have
[45:30] to have is patience with god
[45:33] you cannot have patience with god if you
[45:35] don't have faith
[45:37] if you don't have some strength to
[45:38] endure
[45:39] if you don't have some knowledge to
[45:41] understand how these things have worked
[45:42] in the bible in the past
[45:44] if you don't know about abraham and
[45:46] about noah and about moses and all this
[45:47] if you don't have that knowledge amen
[45:49] you're not going to have patience and
[45:50] then if you don't have enough tempers to
[45:52] control yourself while you're waiting
[45:53] for the promise amen you'll never come
[45:55] to patience amen so you can see how
[45:57] these things are building one upon
[45:58] another and as we build we become we
[46:01] begin to reflect more of that capstone
[46:03] amen shake more more looking more like
[46:06] christ all the time
[46:08] and this is the kind of patience we have
[46:10] to have patience with god
[46:13] he says noah had patience
[46:15] yeah noah had real godly patience god
[46:18] said i'm going to destroy this world
[46:19] with rain and noah preached 120 years
[46:22] yet plenty of patience not even dew fell
[46:25] from heaven wasn't nothing just as dusty
[46:27] as it ever was for 120 years but he was
[46:30] patient then god tries your patience
[46:34] that's right god tries it so how do you
[46:36] get patience by trials when you get
[46:38] patient god tries your patience
[46:41] to build more patience
[46:43] amen now this is when we come
[46:46] when we begin to mature this is when you
[46:48] can begin to some see somebody who would
[46:50] just take god at his word and said i
[46:52] have laid hold of the promise and i know
[46:54] that god is going to move this situation
[46:57] in my life and when you come and see
[46:59] that kind of person that's come to this
[47:00] patience amen they're not down every day
[47:04] and they're also not going to the altar
[47:05] every sunday
[47:08] right because they know i've committed
[47:10] to god it's in his word i'm standing on
[47:12] the word now i'm patiently enduring till
[47:14] god does what he promised me he will do
[47:16] i'm not going back and asking him again
[47:18] i've already asked him amen i'm not i'm
[47:21] i'm not going to doubt whether he heard
[47:23] me and have to say it louder i'm not
[47:25] going to have to wait for a more dynamic
[47:27] ministry i mean i've already asked him
[47:29] amen i've already placed my petition and
[47:31] now i'm going to stand like noah i'm
[47:33] going to wait like abraham i'm going to
[47:35] have this patient endurance knowing that
[47:37] he heard me because i'm his child i
[47:39] prayed the prayer of faith he will
[47:41] answer
[47:44] amen if you go back to god for anything
[47:46] don't go back to say god amen did you
[47:48] hear me just go back to say god i still
[47:50] remember what i said and i still believe
[47:54] i'm just letting you know i'm waiting
[47:55] amen i'm letting you know i'm expecting
[47:57] amen you go back to god all the time you
[48:00] can keep knocking on that door and say
[48:01] god i'm still waiting amen i'm still
[48:04] here i haven't gone anywhere i'm still
[48:06] believing you and i'm still waiting for
[48:08] you to fulfill the word
[48:10] not going back to beg him again would
[48:13] you please do you've already asked him
[48:14] he'll do it
[48:16] but going back to say god i'm still here
[48:18] i still believe i still remember what
[48:21] you said and i'm here lord
[48:24] amen
[48:25] praise god we've got to have holy ghost
[48:29] patience
[48:30] we don't have this patience we'll never
[48:32] progress
[48:33] in the in the stature of a perfect man
[48:36] will constantly be falling back
[48:39] i want to read three scriptures out of
[48:40] the book of hebrew if you'll turn with
[48:42] me
[48:43] to the book of hebrew
[48:45] hebrews and we'll begin with
[48:48] chapter 6 hebrews chapter 6.
[48:57] hebrews chapter 6 verse 12.
[49:02] that you be not slothful but followers
[49:05] of them who through faith and patience
[49:07] inherited the promise
[49:09] so how do they inherit the promise
[49:11] through faith and patience
[49:14] let's go to chapter 10.
[49:17] hebrews chapter 10 verse 36.
[49:23] hebrews chapter 10 and we'll read verse
[49:25] 36
[49:26] for you have need of patience that after
[49:28] you have done the will of god
[49:30] you might receive the promise
[49:32] listen listen the way the scripture is
[49:34] worded
[49:35] you have need of patience
[49:38] that after you have done the will of god
[49:39] you might receive the promise
[49:41] if you don't read that right you read it
[49:44] in a way that doesn't need any patience
[49:47] after i've done the will of god i get
[49:48] the promise
[49:50] well then why did you need patience
[49:52] because after you've done the will of
[49:54] god you'll receive the promise but you
[49:56] may have to wait on it
[49:59] you need patience so that after you do
[50:01] the will of god you can receive the
[50:03] promise when you know you've done the
[50:04] will of god you know you've believed his
[50:06] word and you know you stood on the word
[50:08] then have patience
[50:10] and wait for god to fulfill the word
[50:13] hebrews chapter 12.
[50:16] now we know that hebrews chapter 11 is
[50:19] what we call the heroes of faith chapter
[50:20] and it goes to enoch and and
[50:23] abel and abraham and sarah and isaac and
[50:26] joseph and moses and so many different
[50:28] heroes of the faith amen but i would i'd
[50:31] like to read chapter 12 the next chapter
[50:35] chapter 12 verse 1. wherefore seeing we
[50:37] also are compassed about was so great a
[50:39] cloud of witnesses
[50:40] let us lay aside every weight and the
[50:42] sin that this will easily beset us and
[50:45] let us run with patience the race that
[50:47] is set before us
[50:48] let their example encourage us to run
[50:51] our race with patience looking unto
[50:54] jesus the author and finisher of our
[50:56] faith who for the joy that was set
[50:58] before him endured the cross despising
[51:01] the shame and has set down at the right
[51:02] hand of the throne of god for consider
[51:05] him that endured such contradiction of
[51:07] sinners against himself lest ye be
[51:09] wearied and faint in your minds
[51:11] so part of the definition of patience is
[51:14] endurance
[51:15] and jesus endured because he had a
[51:17] revelation of what was coming
[51:19] he was able to endure such contradiction
[51:21] of sinners he was able to endure the
[51:23] cross despising the shame because he had
[51:25] a revelation of what was coming next he
[51:28] could see amen and we're supposed to
[51:30] have patience amen and he's to be our
[51:32] example of patience we may have to
[51:35] endure we may have to wait it may be
[51:37] difficult but we if we have patience
[51:40] we'll see the promise fulfilled in our
[51:41] lives
[51:46] the statue of a perfect man says we
[51:48] should have patience with one another
[51:50] so first we have to have patience with
[51:52] god
[51:54] and now we should have patience with one
[51:56] another
[51:57] we got so much impatience with one
[52:00] another
[52:01] brother branham is is is telling us we
[52:04] have to have patience with god first we
[52:07] have to wait we have to endure
[52:09] but we also must wait on our brothers
[52:11] and we must endure with our brothers we
[52:13] have to have patience for one another
[52:15] and one of the most horrible things is
[52:17] for us to have impatience with our
[52:18] brothers and sisters
[52:20] i mean sometimes we'll be so forgiving
[52:22] of somebody in the world and so critical
[52:24] of a brother or sister
[52:27] amen and i mean it's like siblings in a
[52:29] family
[52:30] i mean they can treat they can treat
[52:32] somebody else like gold and they treat
[52:34] their siblings like
[52:35] and part of the reason is is because
[52:38] they know that that sibling knows better
[52:41] like you've heard the same lesson i've
[52:43] heard you got the same mom and dad you
[52:45] know better but not realizing you're
[52:47] five years older than that one i mean
[52:49] come on
[52:51] and we're all growing and we've got to
[52:52] give each other time to grow and we've
[52:54] got to be patient with one another and
[52:56] not cut each other down so quickly amen
[52:58] let's endure with some patience one
[53:00] another
[53:01] this doesn't mean enduring sin amen this
[53:04] is enduring childishness
[53:07] in one another immaturity we need to
[53:09] have patience with one another
[53:12] he goes on to say have patience
[53:15] if you've got patience
[53:17] if you're not you're you're crumbling
[53:19] off of this building here see
[53:21] it'll knock all the rest of it down that
[53:23] one thing
[53:25] if you don't have patience if you don't
[53:27] wait amen it'll begin to crumble the
[53:29] building and knock it down
[53:31] you got to have that don't add it
[53:33] because it'll wreck your building if you
[53:34] haven't got patience if you haven't got
[53:36] virtue to add to your faith that you say
[53:38] you god if you haven't got any faith and
[53:40] try to put virtue on it it'll break your
[53:42] faith down see well now wait a minute
[53:44] maybe this is all a mistake anyhow maybe
[53:46] god isn't gone maybe there is no god see
[53:49] it'll break the thing right in two
[53:51] then you've got to have patience amen so
[53:54] many people and that claim to believe
[53:56] the message didn't have patience while
[53:58] they were waiting for god to fulfill all
[54:00] of his word
[54:01] and they've walked away they've crumbled
[54:03] the building has crumbled but we've got
[54:05] to have patience amen it doesn't matter
[54:07] if we're here another 150 years and the
[54:09] world has fallen to complete chaos you
[54:11] still have to have patience god's going
[54:13] to keep his word
[54:15] it's all going to come to pass amen just
[54:17] because it's been 60 years it may be 60
[54:19] years more who knows but i'm telling you
[54:21] one thing if you have patience you'll
[54:23] endure to the end
[54:25] and he that endureth to the end will be
[54:27] saved
[54:30] so add to your patience
[54:32] godliness
[54:34] from
[54:35] faith to virtue to knowledge to
[54:37] temperance to patience to godliness
[54:39] and here's how brother benham describes
[54:41] godliness he said fifthly i had
[54:42] godliness oh godliness is to be added
[54:45] what does godliness mean
[54:46] i looked in four or five dictionaries
[54:48] and couldn't even find what it meant
[54:50] finally i was down at brother jeffrey's
[54:51] there we found it in a dictionary
[54:53] godliness this means to be like
[54:56] to be like god
[54:57] oh my after you've got faith virtue
[54:59] knowledge temperance patience then be
[55:01] like god
[55:03] so you say i can't do that brother but
[55:04] i'm oh yes you can
[55:06] let me just read you a few scriptures
[55:08] here just a minute matthew 5 48 we'll
[55:10] take this one and see what it sounds
[55:12] like matthew 5 48 and see if you're
[55:14] supposed to be like god
[55:16] you know the bible says he are gods
[55:19] jesus said so why all the virtue all the
[55:21] things that's in god is in you matthew 5
[55:23] 48 jesus speaking in the beatitude be
[55:27] therefore
[55:29] p-e-r-f-e-c-t what's that perfect even
[55:32] as your father in heaven is perfect
[55:35] you got way up here now before you're
[55:38] asked to do that all these things has to
[55:40] be added first then when you get up
[55:42] there he's asked you now to be perfect
[55:45] godliness sons and daughters of god
[55:49] so he's asking us to be like god
[55:53] when you get all the way up here to be
[55:55] like god godliness
[55:57] godliness also has a meaning
[56:00] of
[56:01] uh let me see reverence respect and
[56:03] piety towards god amen to respect the
[56:06] things of god and to be like god
[56:09] let's look at colossians chapter 1 verse
[56:10] 14 together it says in whom we have
[56:13] redemption through his blood even the
[56:15] forgiveness of sins
[56:17] who is the image of the invisible god so
[56:19] who was jesus christ he was the image
[56:22] this word image means a likeness
[56:25] he was the likeness of the invisible god
[56:27] the firstborn of every creature so if
[56:29] you wanted to see god you looked at
[56:31] jesus and jesus was the image of god
[56:35] then it goes on to say in romans 8 29
[56:37] for whom he did for no he also did
[56:40] predestinate to be conformed to the
[56:42] image of his son so we're supposed to be
[56:45] formed into the image of christ and
[56:47] christ is the image of god
[56:50] so jesus christ is the reflection or the
[56:52] image or the likeness of god and we're
[56:56] predestinated to be conformed into the
[56:58] likeness of jesus christ therefore we're
[57:00] supposed to be like god
[57:03] but we're predestinated to be that way
[57:05] amen we're predestinated to be conformed
[57:08] into the image of his son that we might
[57:10] be that he might be the firstborn among
[57:13] many brethren
[57:15] amen are we supposed to be like god yes
[57:18] but we've been predestinated to be
[57:20] conformed to the image of his son and
[57:22] his son was in his image
[57:24] so we will be in his
[57:27] image
[57:28] thank god
[57:31] the next one brother branham goes to is
[57:33] brotherly kindness this is the seventh
[57:35] one
[57:36] the definition of brotherly kindness is
[57:38] brotherly love
[57:40] and the in the description down at the
[57:42] bottom says love of brothers or sisters
[57:44] brotherly love in the new testament the
[57:46] love which christians cherish for each
[57:48] other as brethren
[57:51] i think it's interesting that brotherly
[57:52] love is all the way at the top of the
[57:55] statue of a perfect man
[57:57] right next to god himself
[58:00] and i think it goes to show
[58:02] how essential brotherly love is but also
[58:05] how difficult it is to achieve
[58:08] we're not asked to get to this at the
[58:10] base where it's wide amen but as we're
[58:12] shaping up as we're coming closer and
[58:14] closer and more into the image of christ
[58:16] himself that we are to have this virtue
[58:19] of brotherly kindness or brotherly love
[58:21] showing we couldn't accomplish it at the
[58:23] bottom amen it's got to be right here
[58:25] next to god himself amen this is a
[58:27] difficult virtue
[58:29] and one of the reasons i don't i don't
[58:31] remember if i told you i know i've told
[58:33] you before but brother abraham said one
[58:35] time i don't know if it was here or to
[58:36] me brother abraham myra he says
[58:38] brotherly love can only be expressed
[58:41] when a brother needs love
[58:44] so when somebody's doing wrong amen
[58:47] it's the only time that you can express
[58:49] brotherly love amen is when say when you
[58:52] have to love a brother
[58:54] and he might be doing he might be a
[58:56] little unlovable at the time but
[58:58] brotherly love will love him anyhow amen
[59:01] so this is one of the most difficult
[59:03] virtues but the most essential to being
[59:05] like god is to have brotherly kindness
[59:07] or brotherly love
[59:11] brother brahman says now that's a good
[59:12] one right here the six seven it's the
[59:15] seventh all right adding brotherly
[59:17] kindness all right when we
[59:20] when we got to that brother lee kindness
[59:22] put yourself in his place on the matter
[59:25] now you say my brother sinned against me
[59:27] said peter shall i forgive him he said
[59:29] seven times a day
[59:31] he said 70 times seven see
[59:33] brotherly kindness now you see if a
[59:35] brother is all out of tune don't be
[59:37] impatient with him see we go back to
[59:39] patience
[59:41] no see be kind to him
[59:44] when a brother is all out of tune
[59:47] when a brother gets all out of tune or
[59:49] all out of whack he said don't be
[59:51] impatient with him but be patient with
[59:53] him amen be kind to him
[59:56] i think this is so important amen
[59:59] because it's so easy to cut somebody off
[1:00:02] and i think sometimes one of the reasons
[1:00:04] that we cut somebody off is because they
[1:00:06] their their conduct or their attitude or
[1:00:09] approach becomes an embarrassment to us
[1:00:13] because we're associated with them
[1:00:16] we're associated by being in a
[1:00:17] fellowship together amen and we're not
[1:00:20] here to cut people off because we're
[1:00:21] embarrassed of them we're here to cover
[1:00:22] for one another amen we're here to love
[1:00:25] one another we're here to nurture we're
[1:00:26] here to help a brother grow into all
[1:00:28] that he is supposed to be but we're not
[1:00:30] going to do that by being impatient and
[1:00:32] constantly being critical of one another
[1:00:36] amen like i said before if somebody is
[1:00:38] openly in sin then you go to a brother
[1:00:40] in love not to cast them out but to
[1:00:43] restore them
[1:00:44] it's supposed to work by love even
[1:00:46] correction is supposed to work by love
[1:00:48] not correction for the sake of the joy
[1:00:50] of correcting a brother because he's
[1:00:51] embarrassing me and he better shape up
[1:00:54] that's the complete wrong attitude but
[1:00:56] it's a care for a brother's soul i meant
[1:00:58] actually actually concern for him would
[1:01:00] cause me to go when i see him out of the
[1:01:01] way and try to bring him back in line
[1:01:04] it's love expressed to bring that kind
[1:01:06] of correction but there's a kind of
[1:01:08] correction that's not corrective it's
[1:01:10] critical
[1:01:12] and criticism is poison
[1:01:15] it'll destroy criticism just to
[1:01:17] criticize amen just to point out flaws
[1:01:20] but with no
[1:01:22] effort
[1:01:23] into bringing a brother back in line no
[1:01:25] spending yourself giving your own energy
[1:01:28] giving your own time amen being a
[1:01:29] support just criticizing pointing out
[1:01:32] the wrong but never being one involved
[1:01:34] in the restoration
[1:01:36] it's wrong
[1:01:38] but you can see
[1:01:40] how it's all the way up here
[1:01:43] amen it's hard
[1:01:45] it's going to take the holy ghost
[1:01:46] molding christ like character in us for
[1:01:48] best be able to get up here to this
[1:01:50] place where we can love our brothers
[1:01:52] regardless of what they do love them
[1:01:54] anyhow
[1:01:57] i can say
[1:01:58] and when it comes to a brother or sister
[1:02:00] amen you know the first thing somebody
[1:02:02] wants to do is when a brother gets out
[1:02:04] of sorts the first thing we want to do
[1:02:05] is say well they weren't a brother they
[1:02:07] must not have been a real believer
[1:02:10] instead of trying to restore such a one
[1:02:13] we try to make excuses for their
[1:02:15] behavior and they're not part of us
[1:02:18] anyways that's completely wrong
[1:02:22] if they've been here amongst us if
[1:02:24] they've been baptized in this church if
[1:02:25] they've taken communion with us amen
[1:02:28] we've got a responsibility to try to
[1:02:29] restore them
[1:02:31] to cover for them they've been part of
[1:02:32] us and among us and not so quickly say
[1:02:34] well they they went out from us because
[1:02:36] they weren't of us
[1:02:39] but to actually take the harder road
[1:02:42] amen when instead of going one mile go
[1:02:45] the extra mile with the brother amen to
[1:02:48] try to restore this is brotherly
[1:02:49] kindness this is brotherly love how do
[1:02:51] you know brother chad because god did
[1:02:53] all of this for me amen he did every bit
[1:02:56] of this for me i had reason to be cast
[1:02:59] away i had reason for him to quit
[1:03:00] fooling with me i had reason to be
[1:03:02] criticized but he in love kept coming to
[1:03:05] me and pulling me back coming to me and
[1:03:07] pulling me back over and over and over
[1:03:10] again
[1:03:12] i think we need a good healthy dose of
[1:03:14] brotherly love and it's got to be in the
[1:03:17] church
[1:03:18] there's no there's no way around it if
[1:03:20] we believe we're at the end of the end
[1:03:22] of the end and i could ask for a show of
[1:03:24] hands but i'm not going to because
[1:03:25] everybody every one of us sees the world
[1:03:26] in chaos we're at the end of the end of
[1:03:29] the end of the end we should have the
[1:03:31] highest level of brotherly love that's
[1:03:33] ever been expressed before
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:38] that's why i love amen when i see the
[1:03:40] way the individuals in the church take
[1:03:42] care of one another care for each other
[1:03:44] fellowship and make meals and call and
[1:03:47] write cards amen it does my heart good
[1:03:50] because that's the way it ought to be
[1:03:51] amen this should be expressed this
[1:03:54] should be the highest level that has
[1:03:56] ever been on the face of earth in the
[1:03:57] gentile church the highest level of
[1:03:59] brotherly love should be now
[1:04:02] we should be at that time amen where
[1:04:04] it's being expressed
[1:04:06] and so when i see the assembly those
[1:04:08] caring for one another i say praise god
[1:04:10] that's the way it should be
[1:04:12] when i see somebody reaching out to
[1:04:14] somebody else it does my heart good
[1:04:16] because that's where we should be
[1:04:17] friends
[1:04:19] we've got to make sure that we don't
[1:04:22] allow that spirit of
[1:04:24] criticism to enter in
[1:04:27] because it'll be poison for us
[1:04:30] and poisoned for the one who's being
[1:04:32] criticized
[1:04:33] but it's going to take
[1:04:35] a whole lot of brotherly love
[1:04:38] and
[1:04:39] there's a whole lot of brotherly love to
[1:04:40] be had
[1:04:42] amen
[1:04:44] we're going to read some scriptures and
[1:04:45] we're going to see how true this is
[1:04:48] john 13 34
[1:04:51] jesus says a new commandment i give unto
[1:04:53] you
[1:04:53] that you love one another
[1:04:55] as i have loved you
[1:04:58] so how should you love your brother the
[1:05:01] same way jesus loved you
[1:05:04] with the same amount of love with the
[1:05:06] same amount of forgiveness with the same
[1:05:08] amount of effort because he says that
[1:05:10] you love one another as i have loved you
[1:05:13] so how has jesus loved you that's how
[1:05:15] you should love your brother
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] as i have loved you that you also love
[1:05:21] one another
[1:05:22] by this shall all men know that you're
[1:05:25] my disciples if you have loved one to
[1:05:27] another
[1:05:29] jesus never told them that they'll know
[1:05:31] you're my disciples because of the signs
[1:05:33] and wonders
[1:05:36] but you'll know because of this kind of
[1:05:39] love
[1:05:40] because you love one another as i have
[1:05:42] loved you
[1:05:44] what a sign to the world when the world
[1:05:47] has no more true love
[1:05:50] there's no true love left in the world
[1:05:53] what a what a sign to the world a people
[1:05:56] who can love each other
[1:05:58] forgive each other
[1:05:59] so we can we can step on each other's
[1:06:02] toes and still love each other and
[1:06:03] embrace one another
[1:06:07] first peter chapter 1
[1:06:09] seeing you have purified your souls and
[1:06:11] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:06:13] unto unfeigned that means without
[1:06:15] hypocrisy
[1:06:17] genuine unfeigned love of the brethren
[1:06:20] see that you love one another with a
[1:06:21] pure heart fervently these are strong
[1:06:24] words amen this is not just you're
[1:06:26] supposed to love each other but see that
[1:06:28] you you love each other with a pure
[1:06:30] heart fervently he's not just saying
[1:06:32] love one another it's going beyond that
[1:06:34] love each other with a pure heart
[1:06:37] fervently that's intently with strength
[1:06:40] amen
[1:06:42] but it says as john of old he's talking
[1:06:44] about john the apostle
[1:06:47] when he got too old to preach
[1:06:49] he would just sit and scream they tell
[1:06:51] me with all of his might little children
[1:06:53] love one another love one another don't
[1:06:56] let nothing come among you
[1:06:58] see i think it's interesting brother
[1:07:01] branham when he comes to preach christ
[1:07:02] is the mystery of god revealed
[1:07:04] if you've read the beginning of christ
[1:07:06] as the mystery of god revealed one of
[1:07:07] the greatest messages he ever preached
[1:07:09] amen where he's really uh unlocking the
[1:07:12] mystery of the seventh seal when he
[1:07:14] comes to the beginning of that message
[1:07:15] he starts saying now you're one sweet
[1:07:17] group now
[1:07:19] but satan won't let it stay that way and
[1:07:20] he starts to give instructions on how to
[1:07:23] love one another and what to do if
[1:07:25] somebody comes in and starts causing
[1:07:26] division he said you just get sweeter
[1:07:28] and tighten that much up closer together
[1:07:30] and the one that satan's using the the
[1:07:33] to bring dissimilation you just love him
[1:07:35] and he'll either change or leave
[1:07:39] brother brahm didn't say call him out
[1:07:42] have a meeting expose all the wrong
[1:07:44] things they said he says you love them
[1:07:46] that much more and they'll either be
[1:07:48] changed or they'll leave
[1:07:51] so what was the approach for trouble
[1:07:53] more
[1:07:55] what was the approach for somebody
[1:07:57] causing dissimulation not to dissimulate
[1:07:59] but gather that much tighter together
[1:08:01] and love more
[1:08:03] so what is the cure
[1:08:05] more love
[1:08:06] more brotherly kindness is the cure to
[1:08:09] troubles
[1:08:10] amen so when he comes to the beginning
[1:08:12] of christ as a mystery god revealed i
[1:08:14] thought it was so stunning that he would
[1:08:15] lay that in right there after the seals
[1:08:18] and he would begin to show us amen the
[1:08:20] devil is always coming to try to come in
[1:08:22] and disrupt brotherhood he's always
[1:08:24] trying to bring a division he's always
[1:08:26] trying to drive a wedge and brother
[1:08:28] branham said don't you let it happen
[1:08:30] amen you've just received one of the
[1:08:32] greatest revelations that has ever
[1:08:33] struck to earth the seals have been open
[1:08:35] amen that time is now i'm coming to
[1:08:37] preach the threefold purpose of god but
[1:08:40] this one thing you have to guard against
[1:08:42] you have to protect brotherly love
[1:08:46] praise god let's take the lesson
[1:08:49] let's not skip through that page and say
[1:08:50] okay what's that threefold purpose no i
[1:08:53] mean what's the what's the point of
[1:08:54] knowing everything if you can't love one
[1:08:56] another
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:01] i mean you may be able to explain all
[1:09:03] the bible verses in the world amen but
[1:09:06] nobody will know that you're his
[1:09:07] disciple if you don't have loved one for
[1:09:09] another
[1:09:10] it wasn't your knowledge of the word
[1:09:11] that declares your discipleship it was
[1:09:13] the love you have one for another
[1:09:17] and the statue of a perfectly man says
[1:09:19] somebody said not long ago said how can
[1:09:21] you believe these things the way you do
[1:09:23] and still go to the assemblies of god
[1:09:25] and the oneness and all the rest
[1:09:28] then put c
[1:09:30] brotherly kindness how can you do it
[1:09:32] brotherly kindness
[1:09:34] hoping someday see patient with him see
[1:09:37] temperate enduring with him knowledge to
[1:09:40] understand what he believes remember
[1:09:41] it's in his heart that's what it is
[1:09:44] virtue
[1:09:45] in yourself to let it go out with
[1:09:47] kindness meekness to him having faith
[1:09:49] that someday god will bring him in see
[1:09:53] brotherly kindness the seventh thing one
[1:09:55] two three four five six seven
[1:10:00] he says the seventh thing now
[1:10:02] now you're coming the next in add
[1:10:04] charity which is love that's the capping
[1:10:07] stone
[1:10:09] and we can't jump over all of these
[1:10:11] things to the capping stone
[1:10:13] they must be in us and abound
[1:10:18] we must have
[1:10:20] these virtues in us and we must strive
[1:10:22] for them and we must protect them and
[1:10:24] not let the devil strip them out of us
[1:10:26] but we must have all of these in here to
[1:10:27] come into the very image of jesus christ
[1:10:30] which is what we're predestinated to do
[1:10:32] and i thank god amen that his spirit has
[1:10:34] anointed us to have brotherly love
[1:10:37] there's an anointing upon this word
[1:10:39] there's an anointing from the spirit to
[1:10:41] have brotherly love that why is it that
[1:10:42] we love each other so much why is it
[1:10:44] that the trustees can barely lock the
[1:10:46] doors on wednesday night because we
[1:10:47] don't want to leave the fellowship
[1:10:50] amen what is that that's brotherly love
[1:10:52] is that just you no that's god amen
[1:10:55] expressing through you amen because the
[1:10:57] attributes of god are part of god and
[1:11:00] god is love and you can't help but love
[1:11:02] your brother he's an expressed attribute
[1:11:04] of god it is god loving god
[1:11:08] it is god embracing god it is god
[1:11:10] fellowshipping with god it's an
[1:11:12] addiction you can't get away from it
[1:11:14] because these are two these are two
[1:11:17] parts of god that are polarized to one
[1:11:19] another they cannot separate that's
[1:11:21] brotherly love
[1:11:24] the holy ghost is building brotherly
[1:11:26] love
[1:11:30] and the capstone
[1:11:32] is the perfection so all of these
[1:11:35] attributes
[1:11:36] have come back together
[1:11:38] and it's christ himself
[1:11:40] is what it is
[1:11:42] christ himself living in the individual
[1:11:44] god dwelling in a tabernacle of human
[1:11:47] flesh expressing his purpose in this
[1:11:49] world
[1:11:52] the statue of a perfect man he says did
[1:11:54] you ever hear this now let me tell you
[1:11:56] this and keep
[1:11:58] put this on your listening put on your
[1:11:59] listening ear
[1:12:01] a chain is its strongest at its weakest
[1:12:03] link that's right it's no stronger than
[1:12:05] its weakest link no matter how strong
[1:12:07] these are built up this is built up if
[1:12:09] you've got a weak link there's where she
[1:12:11] breaks and it's no stronger than its
[1:12:12] weakest link
[1:12:15] now if you possess
[1:12:16] you say you've got this this this you
[1:12:18] don't have this there's where she breaks
[1:12:20] if you got this and haven't got that
[1:12:22] she'll break right there you got this
[1:12:24] and haven't got that it'll break this
[1:12:26] and haven't got this it'll break
[1:12:28] this and haven't got this it'll break
[1:12:30] and you can't have this without having
[1:12:32] this see when you surrender your
[1:12:34] complete being
[1:12:36] then the holy spirit just pours through
[1:12:38] you in these virtues
[1:12:40] then you're a living tabernacle then
[1:12:42] people look out and say there's a man
[1:12:44] full of virtue knowledge he believes the
[1:12:46] word temperance patience godliness
[1:12:48] brotherly kindness full of the love of
[1:12:50] the holy ghost see here there he is
[1:12:52] walking around what is it a stature that
[1:12:54] unbelievers can look at and say there is
[1:12:57] a christian
[1:12:58] there is a man or a woman who knows what
[1:13:00] they're talking about you've never seen
[1:13:02] a kinder sweeter godlier person you're
[1:13:05] sealed a seal shows on both sides
[1:13:07] wherever you're going or coming you see
[1:13:09] the seal just the same there you are
[1:13:11] when a man or woman possesses this then
[1:13:13] the capstone comes down and seals them
[1:13:15] into the kingdom of god which is the
[1:13:17] holy ghost
[1:13:20] they can somebody can see your life now
[1:13:22] i want you to look at the attributes
[1:13:24] that brother branham is talking about
[1:13:25] when somebody says that's a man of god
[1:13:28] that's a woman of god you've never seen
[1:13:30] a kinder sweeter gentler
[1:13:35] praise god
[1:13:37] we want to have the divine nature
[1:13:40] the the whole purpose
[1:13:42] that god has purposed for us in this age
[1:13:45] is that she will be him amen
[1:13:47] we are to be him that means this divine
[1:13:50] nature has to be on full display
[1:13:52] in us
[1:13:53] there's no shortcuts there's no
[1:13:55] workarounds
[1:13:57] there's no
[1:13:58] freebies there's no give me's we've got
[1:14:00] to have his divine nature by the holy
[1:14:03] ghost
[1:14:04] let's look at first john chapter 4
[1:14:06] together i want to read this scripture
[1:14:08] together
[1:14:14] first john
[1:14:15] chapter 4.
[1:14:22] i'm going to begin reading it verse 7.
[1:14:24] first john chapter 4 verse 7.
[1:14:29] beloved
[1:14:30] let us love one another
[1:14:32] for love is of god
[1:14:34] and everyone that loveth is born of god
[1:14:37] and knoweth god
[1:14:38] he that loveth not knoweth not god for
[1:14:41] god is love
[1:14:43] and this was manifested the love of god
[1:14:45] toward us because that god sent his only
[1:14:47] begotten son into the world that we
[1:14:49] might live through him
[1:14:51] here in his love not that we love god
[1:14:54] but that he loved us and sent his son to
[1:14:56] be the propitiation for our sins
[1:14:59] beloved if god so loved us we ought also
[1:15:02] to love one another
[1:15:04] no man has seen god at any time if we
[1:15:07] love one another god dwelleth in us and
[1:15:09] his love is perfected in us
[1:15:12] hereby know ye
[1:15:14] know we that we dwell in him
[1:15:16] and he and us because he hath given us
[1:15:18] of the spirit
[1:15:19] and we have seen and do testify that the
[1:15:21] father sent the son to be the savior of
[1:15:23] the world
[1:15:24] whosoever shall confess that jesus is
[1:15:26] the son of god god dwelleth in him and
[1:15:29] he and god
[1:15:30] and we have known
[1:15:32] and believed the love that god hath to
[1:15:34] us
[1:15:35] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:15:38] dwelleth in god and god in him
[1:15:41] hearing is our love made perfect that we
[1:15:43] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:15:46] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:15:49] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:15:52] love casts out fear because fear hath
[1:15:54] torment
[1:15:56] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[1:15:58] love
[1:15:59] we love him because he first loved us
[1:16:03] if a man say i love god and hateth his
[1:16:05] brother
[1:16:06] he is a liar
[1:16:07] for he that hateth not his brother
[1:16:10] for for he that loveth not his brother
[1:16:13] whom he hath seen how can he love god
[1:16:16] whom he hath not seen
[1:16:18] and this commandment have we from him
[1:16:20] that he
[1:16:22] may loveth that that he who loveth god
[1:16:25] love his brother also
[1:16:29] there's no way around it friends
[1:16:31] this is why brother brahm said john this
[1:16:33] is the apostle john he was the last of
[1:16:35] the apostles to survive the last of
[1:16:37] jesus disciples to survive and he was an
[1:16:40] old man after he came back from the
[1:16:41] island of patmos he was an old man when
[1:16:43] he went to the island of patmos he was
[1:16:45] an old man when he came back
[1:16:47] and and they said brother brahm said
[1:16:49] that that he was told the histories tell
[1:16:51] that he would just sit he's too old to
[1:16:54] preach couldn't stand and break the word
[1:16:55] and preach anymore but he would cry out
[1:16:57] with all that was in him my little
[1:16:59] children love one another
[1:17:01] his last message his greatest message
[1:17:04] the thing that he said last in his final
[1:17:06] moments his final days or weeks or years
[1:17:08] when his strength was failing there was
[1:17:10] one message he wanted to get
[1:17:12] one last word that if he could drop in
[1:17:14] their heart one last admonition that if
[1:17:16] you could get to them they would have it
[1:17:18] all and he says my little children love
[1:17:21] one another
[1:17:23] if you say we love god who we've not
[1:17:25] seen
[1:17:26] but we hate our brother who we've had
[1:17:28] seen then we're a liar
[1:17:31] because
[1:17:32] god who i have not seen is reflecting in
[1:17:34] my brother who i have seen because
[1:17:36] that's the point that my brother will be
[1:17:38] a reflector of god and come into the
[1:17:40] image of the son and if that image
[1:17:42] expressing the father i don't love how
[1:17:44] can i say i love the father
[1:17:47] you're a liar
[1:17:48] he said but if i love god and the love
[1:17:50] of god is in me i'll love my brother
[1:17:52] because god's in my brother and god's in
[1:17:54] me and will love one another
[1:17:57] that doesn't mean we don't correct one
[1:17:58] another that's love also
[1:18:00] but it has to be motivated by love and
[1:18:02] it has to be done in love
[1:18:05] it doesn't mean that everything is
[1:18:07] acceptable some behavior is unacceptable
[1:18:10] but the correction must come by love and
[1:18:11] in love
[1:18:13] not criticism not casting out
[1:18:16] but really loving one another and i
[1:18:19] think this is
[1:18:20] in the day and age we live in
[1:18:22] the most difficult virtue to be
[1:18:24] expressed
[1:18:26] but when it's expressed you have found
[1:18:28] god
[1:18:29] you have found the dwelling place in god
[1:18:32] of god when you found the people that
[1:18:34] can love one another despite it all
[1:18:38] hey
[1:18:39] will you make another mistake
[1:18:42] yes
[1:18:43] i love you anyhow
[1:18:47] will i say something sometime to hurt
[1:18:49] your feelings
[1:18:50] yes love me anyhow
[1:18:53] has your husbands as your wife ever said
[1:18:56] anything that hurt your feelings
[1:18:58] you loved her anyhow
[1:19:00] wife has your husband ever hurt your
[1:19:02] feelings
[1:19:03] you love him anyhow
[1:19:05] we love our brothers and sisters anyhow
[1:19:09] because that's where god dwells
[1:19:12] that's where my lord is dwelling in that
[1:19:13] vessel and i love my brother did he hurt
[1:19:15] my feelings sure he did but he didn't
[1:19:17] mean it amen
[1:19:19] can you say that not i've got to go i
[1:19:21] got exhibit a exhibit b exhibit c i've
[1:19:23] got to straighten that brother why
[1:19:25] didn't we just say he didn't mean it
[1:19:28] dude like jesus did father forgive them
[1:19:29] they don't know what they're doing why
[1:19:31] can't we just say why has it always got
[1:19:32] to be fixed and fixed and fixed when
[1:19:34] it's just a brother he says something
[1:19:36] insensitive it's just a sister she did
[1:19:38] something insensitive they didn't mean
[1:19:39] it anyhow
[1:19:41] just let it go
[1:19:43] they say god i forgive them and i pray
[1:19:45] you forgive them too that's my brother
[1:19:47] they didn't mean it amen she didn't mean
[1:19:50] it they didn't mean to say that they
[1:19:51] didn't mean to do that i mean as they
[1:19:53] mature they'll be sorry for that later
[1:19:57] is there anything that you think back on
[1:20:00] let's say you think five or six years
[1:20:02] back is there any thought you have about
[1:20:04] a discussion you had with anybody or
[1:20:06] something you said in a group setting
[1:20:07] and you and you're like oh my goodness i
[1:20:09] can't believe i said that i can't
[1:20:11] believe i did that
[1:20:12] or has that only happened to me
[1:20:17] we can look back and say oh i was so
[1:20:19] immature i should have never said that
[1:20:20] that was the wrong setting i i'm so
[1:20:22] embarrassed that i said that hey listen
[1:20:24] somebody's going to say something like
[1:20:26] that to you or in a group setting or to
[1:20:27] you amen and five years later they're
[1:20:29] going to look back and say oh that is so
[1:20:31] embarrassing i wish i wouldn't have said
[1:20:32] that
[1:20:33] let god deal with it let people mature
[1:20:35] let them grow up and say just forgive
[1:20:37] them just let it go my brother didn't
[1:20:39] mean that my sister didn't mean that i
[1:20:41] love him anyhow
[1:20:44] this is the hour for that kind of
[1:20:45] expression
[1:20:47] and if we love them like that they'll
[1:20:49] mature so much faster
[1:20:51] amen
[1:20:55] and the statue of a perfectly man he
[1:20:57] says now that is the house that god
[1:20:58] dwells in not a building with a big bell
[1:21:00] on top of it and a high steeple but a
[1:21:03] body has thou prepared me a body that
[1:21:05] god can dwell in can walk in can see and
[1:21:08] can talk and god can work in amen living
[1:21:11] instrumentality of god god walking on
[1:21:14] two feet in you
[1:21:16] glory the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:21:18] ordered of god god walking in you for ye
[1:21:21] are written epistles read of all men and
[1:21:23] if the life that's in christ be in you
[1:21:26] you'll bear the life that christ bore
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:31] jesus christ didn't just live for his
[1:21:33] brothers he also lived for the sinner
[1:21:37] he lived for the co-worker at work that
[1:21:39] has done you rotten jesus lived for them
[1:21:42] can you live for them
[1:21:44] can you shine the light a dark place for
[1:21:46] somebody who would spit on you if they
[1:21:48] had the opportunity jesus did
[1:21:51] and his life is now to live in us we're
[1:21:53] supposed to reflect the same kind of
[1:21:54] light same kind of life
[1:21:57] so now we've put the blood of jesus
[1:21:59] christ in see
[1:22:01] and that brings the faith of jesus
[1:22:03] christ the virtue of jesus christ the
[1:22:05] knowledge of jesus christ the temperance
[1:22:07] of jesus christ the patience of jesus
[1:22:09] christ the godliness of jesus christ the
[1:22:12] brotherly kindness of jesus christ and
[1:22:14] the love of god
[1:22:15] which is jesus christ
[1:22:17] he's the head and controls you and your
[1:22:19] feet is the foundation of faith amen
[1:22:22] controlled by the head there you are
[1:22:24] there is the perfect man of god
[1:22:26] when he possesses these virtues
[1:22:30] i say god
[1:22:32] i want to be a partaker of the divine
[1:22:33] nature
[1:22:34] by the promises that you've given me
[1:22:36] this is the life i want to live
[1:22:39] let's finish by reading a portion of
[1:22:41] scripture from first corinthians
[1:22:43] together and we'll close with this
[1:22:47] first corinthians chapter 13.
[1:22:51] musicians if you'd like you can go ahead
[1:22:52] and make your way up brother john you
[1:22:54] can make your way up
[1:22:57] first corinthians chapter 13.
[1:23:04] chapter 13 verse 1
[1:23:07] though i speak with the tongue of men
[1:23:09] and angels and have not charity i become
[1:23:11] a sounding brass our tinkling symbol
[1:23:14] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[1:23:16] and understand all mysteries and all
[1:23:18] knowledge and though i have all faith so
[1:23:20] that i could remove a mountain and have
[1:23:22] not charity i am
[1:23:24] nothing
[1:23:26] because what's the goal
[1:23:28] the love of god
[1:23:30] the goal is to think like god to love
[1:23:32] like god the sacrifice like god to give
[1:23:35] like god
[1:23:36] that's the goal
[1:23:37] and if we have all of these wonderful
[1:23:39] gifts
[1:23:40] and have not love
[1:23:42] we're still nothing we still haven't met
[1:23:44] the goal
[1:23:46] i want to read that again
[1:23:48] though i give the gift of prophecy and
[1:23:50] understand all mysteries and all
[1:23:51] knowledge and though i have all faith so
[1:23:53] that i could remove mountains and have
[1:23:54] not charity i am nothing
[1:23:57] and i bestow all my goods to feed the
[1:23:59] poor and though i give my body to be
[1:24:01] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[1:24:03] me nothing
[1:24:05] charity suffereth long and is kind
[1:24:07] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[1:24:10] itself is not puffed up
[1:24:13] does not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[1:24:15] not her own is not easily provoked
[1:24:18] thinketh no evil
[1:24:20] rejoice is not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[1:24:22] in the truth beareth all things
[1:24:25] believeth all things hope with all
[1:24:27] things endureth all things charity never
[1:24:31] faileth
[1:24:33] but whether there be prophecies they
[1:24:34] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[1:24:37] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[1:24:39] it shall vanish away for we know in part
[1:24:41] and we prophesy in part but when that
[1:24:44] which is perfect is come then that which
[1:24:46] is in part shall be done away
[1:24:48] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[1:24:50] understood as a child i thought as a
[1:24:53] child but when i became a man i put away
[1:24:56] childish things for now we see through a
[1:24:59] glass darkly but then face to face now i
[1:25:02] know in part but then shall i know even
[1:25:04] as also i am known
[1:25:06] and now abideth faith hope charity these
[1:25:10] three
[1:25:10] but the greatest of these
[1:25:12] is charity
[1:25:15] that's why brother brenham said if i
[1:25:16] could have just one thing
[1:25:19] any gift any ability any working in the
[1:25:22] spirit if i could have one thing i'd
[1:25:24] want love.
[1:25:26] and after looking at the statue of a
[1:25:28] perfect man i understand why because god
[1:25:30] is love and love is the whole pyramid
[1:25:33] love is christ love is the whole picture
[1:25:37] more than any gift more than any dynamic
[1:25:41] ability more than anything
[1:25:44] we should want to have
[1:25:46] god's love
[1:25:47] we should want to come into the very
[1:25:49] likeness and image of god himself above
[1:25:52] everything else that's the target that's
[1:25:54] the goal and that is what we have been
[1:25:57] ordained to achieve in this day
[1:26:00] this is not something that's far away
[1:26:02] this is not a hope so this is not even
[1:26:04] one of those sermons that you preach
[1:26:05] like this is the goal i mean we'll never
[1:26:07] make it really in this life but we
[1:26:09] should keep driving no this is what
[1:26:11] we've been predestinated for this is why
[1:26:14] amen the seals have opened this is why
[1:26:16] the holy ghost has come back in the
[1:26:18] church in full measure to bring the full
[1:26:20] life of jesus christ back into flesh
[1:26:24] this is for us to live this is for us to
[1:26:26] express all of these virtues are
[1:26:29] available we by the promises can be
[1:26:32] partakers of the divine
[1:26:34] nature i say let that truth encourage us
[1:26:38] to keep moving forward keep growing keep
[1:26:40] walking if these virtues be in you let
[1:26:43] them abound
[1:26:45] the virtues being you and and for many
[1:26:47] of you look around the virtues are there
[1:26:49] you've come to maturity i see god using
[1:26:51] you but let's let the virtues abound
[1:26:53] amen and let's live the full life of
[1:26:56] jesus christ upon this earth
[1:26:58] man god bless you let's stand
[1:27:05] this is not the message of the carrot on
[1:27:07] the stick
[1:27:08] to keep the mule moving forward
[1:27:10] there is no stick
[1:27:12] there's only the divine
[1:27:14] promises of god
[1:27:16] that we can be partakers of the divine
[1:27:18] nature
[1:27:19] there's not another church age there's
[1:27:21] not another generation there's not this
[1:27:24] isn't for somebody else this is for you
[1:27:26] and i
[1:27:27] it's preached not out of reach it's
[1:27:30] preached so that we can reach out and
[1:27:32] take it
[1:27:33] it's been given to us let's take let's
[1:27:35] just receive the let's be partakers of
[1:27:37] the divine nature and let it work that
[1:27:40] good work inside of us amen and let's be
[1:27:43] changed into the thing that we're
[1:27:45] looking at
[1:27:46] and come into the very image of the
[1:27:48] thing we're looking at which is jesus
[1:27:50] christ in all of his glory that's what
[1:27:52] this message is this message is christ
[1:27:55] christ has been unveiled so we can see
[1:27:57] all of him
[1:27:59] and we can become
[1:28:01] what we're looking at
[1:28:02] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:28:04] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[1:28:07] we thank you god that you've given us a
[1:28:09] promise
[1:28:11] and this promise come because of
[1:28:12] predestination
[1:28:15] god if it wasn't for predestination lord
[1:28:17] none of us would be able to attain to
[1:28:19] anything
[1:28:20] because in our own strength we're
[1:28:22] failures to begin with
[1:28:24] we've been sowed into hybridization
[1:28:26] we've been born in weakness and we're
[1:28:28] not capable in ourselves
[1:28:31] but that's why lord you determined
[1:28:33] before the foundation of the world
[1:28:35] that you were going to have a church
[1:28:37] without spot or wrinkle
[1:28:39] now you you were going to send the word
[1:28:41] lord that would chip away all of the
[1:28:43] misunderstanding
[1:28:44] that would move away all of the doubts
[1:28:46] and all the fears lord so that we could
[1:28:49] see lord who you really are
[1:28:52] and lord if we can behold you in all of
[1:28:54] your glory
[1:28:55] we can become what we're looking at
[1:28:58] you know and i just pray that you would
[1:29:00] allow each one of us to be a partaker of
[1:29:02] your divine nature
[1:29:04] god that by the promises you've given to
[1:29:06] us we would have faith just to reach out
[1:29:08] and receive more
[1:29:09] to take more lord of your faith and
[1:29:12] virtue
[1:29:13] more lord of your temperance and your
[1:29:15] patience and your godliness lord and
[1:29:17] your brotherly kindness and all that
[1:29:19] love let it weld together in us all this
[1:29:22] virtue so that we would be in your very
[1:29:24] image upon this earth
[1:29:26] and lord not that it would have to be
[1:29:27] that we have to tell everybody who we
[1:29:29] are but lord they'll know they'll sense
[1:29:31] it already they'll know this is a child
[1:29:34] of god that's in my presence
[1:29:36] because of the nature
[1:29:39] god we ask that you would bless us as we
[1:29:41] go from here
[1:29:42] help us to live in this world as you
[1:29:44] would live
[1:29:45] lord you're tabernacled in us let us go
[1:29:48] out with that consciousness daily lord
[1:29:50] and live the life you've called us to
[1:29:52] live
[1:29:53] we love you and we thank you for what
[1:29:54] you're doing in us we can see it lord
[1:29:57] and we want more let these virtues
[1:29:59] abound in us lord we pray
[1:30:02] in jesus christ's name
[1:30:04] amen man god bless you brother john
