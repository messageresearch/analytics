TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the character comes from the seed because all the fruit comes from the seed fruit always comes from the seed and the seed is in your soul amen but it's quickened the life but what has to happen the outside has got to be shaped so the inside as it grows can reflect the right characteristics and the right nature so what does God have to do to us he has to shape us he has to knock off that came from Grandpa that now that part of faithfulness can come from Grandpa he wants that now that temper that comes from Grandpa he doesn't want that all right that loveliness that come from Grandma that Sweet Disposition he wants that amen but that gossip Spirit from Grandma he doesn't want that so now you see the end time evangelism is not just finding the Stones it's shaping the stones amen and we've got to be shaped we've got to be cut by the word of God and there has to be a stone Mason in our life to help cut us and that stone Mason can work through many different gifts but that stone Mason is Christ and what's he doing he's never trying to destroy the stone he's trying to bring the stone into the image he had in his mind before the foundation of the world because that stone is predestinated to fit into this spot no other Stone will fit and this Stone won't fit until it's shaped until it's shaped and it's fit every other Stone will be thrown off so part of the end time evangelism you say I believe the message I believe God sent a prophet I have a revelation in the seals I know the seals are open I know Christ took the book and loosen seals I know all of that so why are you still here why are you still living a daily life why are you still going to work dealing with family and having storm blow shingles off your roof and having temperament problems at work and why are we still coming to church week after week and the routine of coming why are we doing that we know the message we know God sent a prophet we know we're elected we know we're Pride we know the seals are open we know maybe we're still here because he's shaping us maybe he's bringing us into the perfect stature of a perfect man until we can perfectly reflect the life of Jesus Christ why we don't skip church not for legalism for necessity because there's this little thing jetting out the side of the stone that keeps causing me problems whenever I get near another Stone I need somebody who's got a sharp tool to whack that thing off of me and it may be the guy in the Pulpit that Sunday that does it or it may be the sister and the foyer that does it for me however it happens somebody's got to whack that thing off of me because it's causing me lots of problems
