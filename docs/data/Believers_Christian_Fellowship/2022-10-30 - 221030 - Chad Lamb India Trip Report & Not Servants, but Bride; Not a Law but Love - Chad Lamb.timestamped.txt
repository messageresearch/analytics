[4:37] love
[4:38] love his friends to me oh that Christ
[5:05] is he just who I am
[5:09] oh I'm a part of my savior
[5:15] a part of his word is
[5:23] angel
[5:24] Ina
[5:31] sing that who I am
[5:36] doing brother Joseph
[5:52] I'm a part of my day
[6:07] free destination
[6:16] well it's good to be home
[6:18] um definitely homesick for the people
[6:21] the language barrier there makes it
[6:23] pretty difficult to
[6:25] to have kind of a humble feeling but
[6:28] there's still a fellowship there with
[6:29] the brothers even though you may not
[6:31] understand half what they're saying or
[6:33] what you're saying to them
[6:36] greetings from the people in India we
[6:39] had several ministers to send greetings
[6:41] and greetings to the people of India who
[6:44] are streaming or watching
[6:47] um
[6:48] I want to thank every one of you for
[6:50] praying for the trip we had a good trip
[6:54] there was some obstacles in our bodies
[6:56] from the travel that wasn't very
[6:58] pleasant but knowing that everyone was
[7:00] back home praying really helped us out
[7:02] me personally my feet and ankles swelled
[7:06] up like like a bloated animal alongside
[7:08] the road when we got there
[7:11] so I was like oh this can't be happening
[7:13] I don't want to have this deal with this
[7:15] all week but after a couple days it
[7:16] subsided so I knew that everyone was
[7:19] praying
[7:21] um I'm grateful thankful the Lord to
[7:23] have an opportunity to go to India
[7:25] experience of a lifetime much different
[7:28] than than anything around here
[7:31] um
[7:32] and
[7:33] being
[7:35] the above average size that I am
[7:37] uh
[7:40] it was easy to be a celebrity with the
[7:42] children over there
[7:44] you know it wasn't too long after the
[7:46] first service before they were
[7:47] surrounding me and holding out their
[7:49] phones and taking pictures because
[7:51] I'm a giant they don't see him
[7:54] so that was good but uh brother Branham
[7:57] talked about being a celebrity of heaven
[7:59] and uh the people over there really make
[8:01] you feel like that
[8:02] there's definitely a love
[8:05] for
[8:06] the ministry and uh it was it was very
[8:10] humbling
[8:12] um obviously the language the food the
[8:14] physical environment
[8:17] um the travel the travel
[8:20] and the traditions and the music are all
[8:23] different all all extremely different
[8:26] but uh there's the same brotherly love
[8:30] there's the same Unity
[8:33] um the Same Same Love of the word and
[8:36] the same Hospitality
[8:38] I've joked around with a with a few
[8:40] people that have had me over at their
[8:42] house about being being a victim of
[8:45] hospitality in their home but India it
[8:49] takes the crown I mean they they they
[8:52] send it in waves
[8:54] you don't if you're done eating
[8:57] you're not donating
[9:00] someone will offer you more you tell
[9:02] them no they'll back off and then 30
[9:05] seconds later someone new will come up
[9:07] and offer you some more so it's it was
[9:10] wonderful uh I don't know that uh
[9:16] [Music]
[9:18] it is a lot of what I think it's going
[9:20] to be like when we get there just
[9:21] everybody loves you just and all the all
[9:24] the faces of the people are bright and
[9:25] full of life and it was just wonderful
[9:27] to be there and seeing them worship and
[9:30] and being a part of it
[9:32] um my responsibility there was to take
[9:35] lots of pictures and videos
[9:38] and bring that report back to brother
[9:41] Franco which he said I did a good job so
[9:44] we'll see how that goes when brother
[9:45] Chad comes out with everything
[9:47] um
[9:48] I'll let him
[9:50] do most of the speaking on the on the
[9:52] report
[9:53] I showed my children I showed the
[9:56] children in my class this morning that
[9:58] there's a video on YouTube that that the
[10:00] people of India did so they got to see
[10:02] it if you want to see it it's it's a
[10:04] glimpses of sham tarazi convention so
[10:08] you probably won't remember that but but
[10:10] it's out there and I think he's also got
[10:12] the uh of the other sermons up also so
[10:18] that's it for now it's good to be home I
[10:22] really missed every one of you and
[10:24] missed my missed my class and uh being
[10:28] around the children there was uh
[10:31] it really made me homesick so it's good
[10:33] to be home
[10:39] Lord my heart desire
[10:43] always to burn with Spirits fire
[10:49] purpose is to worship you alone
[10:57] the Lord I've been
[11:01] won't you worship and adore
[11:06] to be a fragrance offered to your throne

[18:22] God for the support we had from back
[18:24] home as brother Joe was saying it was uh
[18:27] it was wonderful I appreciate all the
[18:29] brothers who ministered while we were
[18:31] gone Brother Kyle and brother Nathanael
[18:33] and brother Noel we appreciate those
[18:34] Brothers also I talked to brother
[18:37] Emmanuel yesterday and he and sister
[18:38] Mimi are traveling back now they should
[18:40] be home this evening so we want to
[18:41] continue to remember them in prayer
[18:44] also I don't want to forget this I have
[18:46] a special note here I brought back some
[18:49] candy from India I always like to try to
[18:51] bring back some candy for the children
[18:53] so there's a little table set up beside
[18:55] the welcome desk there that has some uh
[18:59] Indian candy amen so all the children
[19:02] are welcome to have some afterwards once
[19:04] the children have some then everybody's
[19:06] welcome to have some but the children
[19:07] get to go first amen also somebody when
[19:10] I was there gave me a big bundle of
[19:12] keychains that they've had made that
[19:14] they only believe in the spirit and the
[19:16] bride say come and there's a couple
[19:17] different keychains there and they
[19:19] wanted to give that to the congregation
[19:20] so that's on the table as well so
[19:22] anybody who wants to pick one up you're
[19:23] welcome to that after the service so we
[19:26] just thank God that we're here thank God
[19:29] that we're home uh also I just wanted to
[19:33] say right from the beginning I'm wearing
[19:35] a brand new suit
[19:36] that brother Roshan and his family
[19:38] bought for me in India and I was really
[19:41] so blessed by that nobody's ever bought
[19:43] me a suit before
[19:44] and we stopped at a store and brother
[19:46] Roshan said we're stopping by a store
[19:47] and he says I'm going to tell you the
[19:49] rules that's like rules why do we have
[19:52] rules and he said I don't remember all
[19:55] the rules but basically it was just do
[19:56] what I say so
[19:59] and so we went in and he said from him
[20:02] and his family they wanted to buy a suit
[20:05] and as a memory from them and and I
[20:08] really appreciated that and then I was
[20:10] terrified I've never bought a suit
[20:11] before in my life my wife buys them all
[20:13] and I've never picked out my own clothes
[20:15] and all of a sudden I don't I like this
[20:18] is going to be a Monumental disaster I
[20:21] don't know what to do so luckily brother
[20:24] rashawn's wife Pamela she helped me and
[20:27] when I got home Angie said that's the
[20:29] exact color I wanted you to have I said
[20:31] well thank you Lord God was working on
[20:34] both ends
[20:35] so I really appreciate their Hospitality
[20:38] as brother Joe is saying they were so
[20:40] kind to us everyone was so kind to us
[20:42] they they take the cake for hospitality
[20:45] and so they were a real treat to have
[20:48] and I really appreciate what they've
[20:51] done for us and everybody was that way
[20:54] everywhere we went they wanted to give
[20:55] gifts they wanted to give food they
[20:57] wanted to treat you good and it was
[20:58] really nice to be with the Believers
[21:00] there and we really enjoyed that also
[21:02] brother Joe's outfit is a gift from
[21:04] Brother Rashon and his family so they
[21:06] took care of him too they said we want
[21:07] to buy you something I said brother Joe
[21:09] you're never going to find Clues to fit
[21:10] in here and sure enough they had clothes
[21:13] that fit him I could not believe it and
[21:16] so it worked out really really good so
[21:19] we just appreciate how good that they
[21:21] were to us everybody was the same way
[21:23] they were so hospitable and friendly and
[21:26] kind to us
[21:27] uh the trip started off just a little
[21:30] bit rough for me and I just saw the
[21:33] grace of God right from the beginning
[21:35] I'd woke up Saturday night if you
[21:37] remember we left Sunday evening and I
[21:40] preached Sunday morning and then brother
[21:41] Joe and I caught a plane about nine nine
[21:44] PM Sunday night out of Detroit and I
[21:46] woke up in the night somewhere in the
[21:48] night three or four o'clock in the
[21:50] morning and my my face was aching I had
[21:53] an abscessed tooth and I knew I had
[21:56] problems with the tooth because I went
[21:57] to the dentist a couple months ago and
[22:00] they found all kinds of affection around
[22:02] some roots of my teeth and they
[22:04] prescribed three root canals for me I
[22:06] had the first root canal done a couple
[22:07] months ago then you have to wait five or
[22:10] six weeks I had the second root canal
[22:11] done I don't know five weeks ago or
[22:14] whatever and I knew I had a third root
[22:16] canal scheduled for next week and so
[22:19] when I was there the doctor was telling
[22:21] me the the Dennis was telling me how
[22:23] they had to spread them out and I said
[22:26] well I'm going to to in India and she
[22:29] goes you're going to India I said yeah
[22:31] and so she goes you know when you get on
[22:34] the airplane that can flare up that can
[22:36] make that worse I said okay
[22:39] and so she says I want you to take
[22:41] penicillin with you and so she got me a
[22:44] prescription for penicillin so I filled
[22:46] it and I didn't want to fill it but it
[22:47] was only five bucks I said praise God
[22:50] I'll take it along so I threw it in the
[22:52] bag well I woke up in the night and it
[22:55] was just it was I've had an abscess
[22:57] tooth before I've had root canals before
[22:58] I knew what it was and it was killing me
[23:01] so I knelt down and prayed and I said
[23:03] Lord I you know you know I'm going to
[23:06] India and I said I don't know what to do
[23:09] I said but Lord if this subsides if if
[23:12] the pain goes away I'll go on the Indian
[23:15] and sure enough it did after I prayed
[23:16] for about an hour it went away I went
[23:19] back and laid back down I got up I
[23:20] preached I had absolutely no problem so
[23:23] I said I'm going so we got in the car
[23:24] and we went and wouldn't you know it on
[23:27] the way up there it starts flaring up
[23:28] again jaw starts swimming starts hurting
[23:31] and we got there early to get through
[23:32] security and all that and I told brother
[23:34] Joe I said work there's a steakhouse in
[23:36] in this terminal I said we're gonna go
[23:38] eat a piece of meat because this is the
[23:41] last beef we're gonna have for 12 days
[23:45] so when you go to a Hindu country who
[23:47] believes their mother is a cow they
[23:49] don't allow you to slaughter cows so
[23:51] so we were we were eating the meat and
[23:53] it kept getting worsted to meal I
[23:55] couldn't eat on this side I had to chew
[23:57] carefully it was getting worse and worse
[23:59] and worse and and all of a sudden you
[24:01] start having thoughts should I get on
[24:03] this plane
[24:04] what what happened what happens if you
[24:07] wind up in India with an abscessed tooth
[24:09] and pain that you can't bear I just say
[24:12] knock it out I mean just take it but so
[24:14] I'm having all these thoughts should I
[24:16] go should I not go but I remembered back
[24:18] to what I prayed in the morning and I
[24:19] said if it eases up and the pain goes
[24:21] away I'll go on to India and it did and
[24:24] so I told brother Joe that what was
[24:27] going on and you know he looked at me I
[24:29] don't know what he thought but if I was
[24:30] him I know what I would think don't do
[24:33] this to me
[24:34] so we're sitting there and all of a
[24:36] sudden I looked at Joe and I said well
[24:38] you can't blame the devil for trying can
[24:40] you and I just determined to go on you
[24:43] know so we did we went on we got on the
[24:46] plane I went ahead and took a first
[24:48] round of antibiotic
[24:50] and wouldn't you know it it started
[24:52] getting better
[24:54] and on the plane ride it got better it
[24:56] still hurt but it got better the next
[24:58] day it got better and by the third or
[25:00] fourth day it was gone amen and it's
[25:03] still gone and I thank God for that and
[25:05] it wasn't the antibiotic because I quit
[25:07] taking it so I'm not good at taking
[25:10] medicine I'm terrible at it and you have
[25:13] to take it at certain times when you eat
[25:15] and don't eat and I couldn't figure it
[25:17] out there's no time there was no time we
[25:19] didn't eat I mean did we ever go an hour
[25:21] without eating only when we slept so
[25:23] there's no time to take it on an empty
[25:24] stomach so I quit taking it and God just
[25:27] absolutely took care of it and and I
[25:30] knew that I knew that was just the devil
[25:33] and I knew it was an attempt right in
[25:36] the airport right we're getting ready to
[25:38] get on the plane there was always this
[25:40] temptation to turn back and this fear
[25:42] that started coming and I just resisted
[25:44] it and pushed through and God
[25:46] supernaturally took care of it and
[25:48] nobody knew that I was up Saturday night
[25:50] with tooth pain I kept that a secret to
[25:52] myself just me and God
[25:54] but God was good God was absolutely
[25:58] wonderful to us and now that I look back
[26:00] on the trip I know I know it was the
[26:03] enemy and I know it was a deterrent
[26:05] because God was so blessed us through
[26:07] the trip and it was so fruitful and it
[26:09] was such a blessing that I needed to go
[26:11] and I needed to be there and God really
[26:13] put his hand upon us and took care of it
[26:15] so we really appreciate you guys praying
[26:18] I really means a lot you may not have
[26:20] known how earnestly we needed your
[26:22] prayers but we sure did but God was
[26:25] super faithful to us I've learned some
[26:27] good lessons through that just to trust
[26:30] God if God answers a prayer and you pray
[26:33] like that trust him it'll be okay amen
[26:36] so God was God was really good to us we
[26:38] had good flights everything worked out
[26:40] great we got there
[26:42] and and started our journey and so we
[26:45] just we thank God for that
[26:47] when uh this is the first time I've ever
[26:50] been to India and so it was a it was a
[26:53] new experience for us but brother
[26:55] rashawn's a friend from way back with
[26:56] known Brothers short Sean for years he's
[26:58] been coming over for years he's preached
[27:00] here several times he's been a good
[27:02] friend and we've worked together to help
[27:04] him with some of his Outreach and
[27:05] Mission work for a long time so I really
[27:08] wanted to go see him and go see the work
[27:10] that he was doing and he had asked a few
[27:12] times but it finally worked out this
[27:14] time so he lives in the state of Punjab
[27:16] which is up north in India and so you
[27:19] can see where he's at there I think yeah
[27:22] you can see and and so it's a nice area
[27:25] it's a really nice area it's an
[27:27] agricultural area so it was good to be
[27:29] there and we got there and he gave us
[27:31] the next day to rest and so we went over
[27:33] and looked at the church project that
[27:34] he's working on brother Rashon started
[27:37] his church in his house and he added on
[27:40] to his house to make a little sanctuary
[27:42] in addition to his house and now they've
[27:44] filled up that Sanctuary they've Spilled
[27:46] Out into the street they've got people
[27:48] sitting in the balcony people sitting
[27:50] all over the in the sanctuary and people
[27:52] sitting out in the streets every service
[27:54] so they've outgrown their sanctuations
[27:57] they're building this one that's bigger
[27:59] and they've moved it away from his house
[28:01] and it's out by the main road that comes
[28:03] into the town
[28:05] excuse me so he's really hoping to do
[28:07] more Outreach and having that location
[28:10] he believes will help there's many
[28:11] people who've wanted to come to his
[28:13] church but they there was no room for
[28:15] them so there's people who went and
[28:17] travel to come because there's no place
[28:18] to sit and there's people who felt
[28:20] uncomfortable coming into his home for
[28:21] church and so he knows that there'll be
[28:23] many more people join in once this is
[28:26] done
[28:27] so he's working on that it happened to
[28:29] be that while I was there they were
[28:30] going to pour the concrete for the
[28:32] ceiling they were going to put the
[28:33] ceiling on it and if you look all these
[28:36] little sticks underneath are holding up
[28:38] the forms for the concrete and they
[28:40] looked like sticks
[28:42] they're little trees and it's holding
[28:44] all the forms in place then they
[28:46] stretched all the rebar across it and
[28:47] they're going to pour the concrete on
[28:48] top so when we were out there I knew
[28:51] what was underneath me it was all those
[28:52] sticks
[28:54] so I kept trying to move away from
[28:56] people you know I think in pounds per
[28:58] square inch
[29:00] foreign
[29:02] but it was fine they had rebar stretched
[29:04] the whole length I mean nothing was
[29:05] going to go anywhere but I just couldn't
[29:07] quit doing some calculations in my mind
[29:10] so but while we were there he asked us
[29:12] to pray over them the capping off of the
[29:15] building and the next phase of the
[29:16] construction and so we had everything
[29:19] word of Prayer
[29:22] [Music]
[29:26] things in the name of our Lord Jesus
[29:28] Christ
[29:30] [Music]
[29:37] [Applause]
[29:41] foreign
[29:41] [Applause]
[29:44] [Music]
[29:46] it was an exciting day for the church
[29:48] there to see the construction moving
[29:50] forward they had they were pumping
[29:52] concrete up through the ceiling and it
[29:55] was a busy day a lot of work was going
[29:57] on and this is the day after that we
[29:59] arrived
[30:14] foreign
[30:22] footage on all the
[30:24] um photography and I really appreciate
[30:26] him coming along he did a fantastic job
[30:28] and before we even got back he had
[30:31] transferred all the files over to
[30:33] brother Franco before I got back brother
[30:35] Franco already had a PowerPoint done he
[30:37] just put every picture and video in
[30:38] there and I just had to sort through
[30:39] them delete reorder and all that and
[30:42] they did a great job so I appreciate
[30:43] their help it was very fantastic the
[30:46] brother Joe was great to have along he
[30:48] was great to travel with and he did a
[30:50] fantastic job
[30:51] uh this is the fellowship hall that they
[30:54] already built they already finished this
[30:56] this has restrooms in it has a kitchen
[30:58] and a store room where they store stuff
[31:00] and the outside little Fellowship area
[31:02] there and that's where they're currently
[31:04] having church we'll show you a picture
[31:05] of that later because we had church here
[31:07] on Sunday and so they're having church
[31:09] here while they finish the building this
[31:12] is the front of the property they put a
[31:14] fence around their property so they put
[31:16] a a brick wall fence completely around
[31:19] the property they were able to buy one
[31:21] acre of property and to build this and
[31:24] have the fellowship home and this is the
[31:27] front fence that they put in they made
[31:28] it a little bit nicer because it's the
[31:30] front and have an entrance on either
[31:31] side but this is the advertisement they
[31:34] were advertising for the convention that
[31:36] they were going to have here on the 25th
[31:38] and
[31:40] they had these posters banners and
[31:43] billboards everywhere like everywhere we
[31:47] drove they had these Billboards and I
[31:49] started getting nervous I thought this
[31:51] is a big deal like I thought we were
[31:52] coming over for services and and they
[31:54] posted this everywhere and they told me
[31:56] they've been in inviting everybody and
[31:57] and you know I'm just praying God give
[32:00] me wisdom on how to take these services
[32:03] and and I learned as I was talking to
[32:05] brother Sean that this is really
[32:08] a big convention for them because it's
[32:11] the first time that they've had a place
[32:13] where they can gather all the message
[32:15] Believers in Punjab in that area they've
[32:18] never had a place or a facility where
[32:20] they can get any more than a couple
[32:21] hundred together at a time so they had
[32:23] invited all the other message Believers
[32:25] and all the other churches and they were
[32:27] planning on coming and they had
[32:29] testified to everybody in their
[32:30] neighborhood and all their friends and
[32:32] put Billboards and stuff everywhere and
[32:34] we're Gathering anybody that would come
[32:36] and and they expected to have quite a
[32:38] few denominational Believers there
[32:40] because the the Christian Community is
[32:43] such a minority in India I think it's
[32:45] only 2.3 percent of the population of
[32:47] India that whenever the Christians have
[32:49] an event they all come together they
[32:51] don't divide much on denominational
[32:52] barriers because they're a minority
[32:54] there's so few they do things together
[32:56] so they believe there'd be quite a few
[32:58] denominational Believers there and a lot
[33:01] of the message Believers so I mean
[33:03] everywhere we drove even in the next
[33:05] Village is over we saw Billboards and
[33:07] Banners and posters and I I said go on I
[33:09] started praying God help me you know I
[33:11] didn't want to disappoint anybody and
[33:13] also it was it was it was the first
[33:16] event that they were going to have on
[33:18] their new church property and it was
[33:20] like an introduction of the church to
[33:22] the community because it's on a main
[33:25] road coming into town they wanted
[33:27] everybody to know that they were a
[33:29] Christian Church where they were and
[33:31] they want to invite everybody to see it
[33:32] as an Outreach and as a witness to the
[33:34] whole area because he says there's not
[33:35] any Christian churches in that Village
[33:37] or some of the neighboring Villages and
[33:39] he believed some Christians would even
[33:41] gather and he could have a chance to
[33:43] testify and witness to them so it was a
[33:45] way to introduce the church to the whole
[33:46] community in the region and a way to
[33:49] gather all the Believers together in
[33:50] that area for the first time ever so it
[33:54] was a
[33:55] much bigger meeting than I thought and
[33:58] had more significance
[34:00] if some of you may remember that brother
[34:02] Jiva rotten and Marla booty he was here
[34:04] a couple years ago and stayed a little
[34:06] over a week with our family and he's
[34:08] there on the left and some of his boys
[34:10] traveled with him and they played some
[34:11] of the music for the meetings so it was
[34:13] good to see him he lives quite far away
[34:15] he lives in the southern part of India
[34:17] but he traveled up because we've stayed
[34:20] in contact and he wanted to have
[34:21] Fellowship so he came up for the
[34:22] meetings
[34:23] and then this brother to the left is
[34:25] brother Samuel bumbaca he he lives in
[34:28] Hyderabad he lives quite a distance away
[34:29] but he came in for the meetings and him
[34:32] and I got acquainted he has been through
[34:34] the covet era he started coordinating
[34:36] Zoom meetings for The Minister's
[34:38] meetings and they had asked me to do one
[34:40] of those meetings over zoom and I did
[34:42] and him and I got acquainted as he
[34:43] coordinated that so it was really good
[34:45] to get to meet him in person and shake
[34:47] his hand and have fellowship and we had
[34:49] some wonderful times of Fellowship
[34:53] brother Joe I didn't know it but he was
[34:55] in the front seat because he's got the
[34:57] longest legs they keep putting him in
[34:59] the front seat and uh so he got front
[35:03] row seats for an exciting ride
[35:04] everywhere he went but he shot a little
[35:06] video of of riding through the streets
[35:09] in India
[35:11] and
[35:12] just see if you can notice any traffic
[35:14] laws let me know if you or if you see
[35:17] what might be a violation of any write
[35:20] them down
[35:22] it's a
[35:24] um
[35:25] I'm glad I wasn't in the front seat
[35:26] because sometimes what I do is just
[35:28] close my eyes and pray that that we
[35:30] don't hit anybody but they're excellent
[35:32] drivers brother rashawn's oldest son
[35:35] henok which is Enoch for us but hanuk in
[35:38] in Punjabi he uh he just started
[35:42] learning to drive recently he was an
[35:44] excellent driver and he drove us
[35:45] everywhere we went and so we felt secure
[35:48] with him but I told him I said if you
[35:50] can drive here you can drive anywhere in
[35:52] America
[35:53] you come on over you you'll be fantastic
[35:56] I mean everybody takes turns before they
[35:58] pull out we stay in our lane I mean it's
[36:01] easy
[36:02] so you have to be a skilled driver to
[36:05] drive here
[36:06] but yeah there's there's many times when
[36:09] it gets to be quite oppressed and
[36:11] there's pedestrians and people on bikes
[36:13] I just close my eyes
[36:17] in the anxiety goes away
[36:24] you just see the conditions for
[36:27] um
[36:28] several of the days we were traveling
[36:30] for meetings we would travel an hour and
[36:33] a half upwards of close to two hours and
[36:35] this is the way to travel so it's not
[36:37] easy travel traveling is quite difficult
[36:39] the vehicles are a bit smaller and roads
[36:42] are rough and so traveling is is is
[36:45] quite a deal when brother Joe said in
[36:47] the traveling he meant the traveling it
[36:49] it's quite exhausting quite tiring but
[36:52] the people are wonderful and the
[36:53] fellowships we had were great this is
[36:55] the first church that we visited
[36:58] this little church was packed out this
[37:01] is brother a Jeep Messi's church and he
[37:05] brother Ajit was a Pentecostal Minister
[37:07] just several years ago I think like five
[37:09] years ago and they were witnessing to
[37:11] him he had a brother-in-law that came to
[37:12] the message that kept witnessing to him
[37:14] then he got in contact with brother
[37:15] Rashawn and they shared the message and
[37:17] after a while he comes to the message
[37:19] shared it with his whole church they
[37:21] baptized I believe about the whole
[37:23] church and this church was established I
[37:25] think if I remember correctly about five
[37:27] years ago and so we came here to
[37:29] minister and you can see part of the
[37:31] service
[37:32] okay
[37:36] [Music]
[37:41] again
[37:52] [Applause]
[37:56] [Music]
[38:01] [Applause]
[38:04] foreign
[38:07] [Music]
[38:08] [Applause]
[38:11] [Music]
[38:18] [Music]
[38:23] they really worship they really love the
[38:25] Lord they really love the word and
[38:26] really respond to the word and really
[38:27] worship but the music style is Eastern
[38:30] not Western it's totally different and
[38:33] for brother Joe and I I mean we couldn't
[38:35] even clap we didn't even know what to do
[38:36] we just we just listened because it was
[38:39] totally foreign to us something that was
[38:41] completely new but it was very
[38:42] interesting just to see and you think
[38:45] about the great worship services that
[38:47] we'll have on the region Beyond when
[38:49] everybody worships the way they Worship
[38:51] the Lord before it'll be wonderful to
[38:53] hear the Africans and the Indians and
[38:56] and the Americans all worship God so it
[38:58] was quite interesting you can see they
[39:00] had the building packed out this is us
[39:02] standing to read the scripture but these
[39:04] little guys to my right were really
[39:06] sitting like on my feet I mean we were
[39:08] packed in from as close as we could I
[39:10] was glad that I'm not an evangelist I
[39:12] don't need to move to preach I can stand
[39:13] still because there was no moving you
[39:15] would have stepped on somebody or trip
[39:16] and so it was packed in and it was it
[39:20] was it was a really good service really
[39:22] good atmosphere
[39:25] the next day we we traveled to brother
[39:27] Aaron George's and we had two Services
[39:28] there and this is the morning service
[39:31] and this is the evening service I had a
[39:34] nice Fellowship nice time there at the
[39:36] church great response to the word and
[39:39] they're so appreciative of the word and
[39:41] and they really respond well and they're
[39:43] really grateful I think this is the
[39:45] church where brother Joe and I probably
[39:47] had our picture taken about 1 000 times
[39:51] maybe one thousand and two hundred I
[39:53] don't know but somewhere in the excess
[39:55] of a thousand every family came up
[39:57] family by family we had pictures taken
[39:59] so I've learned just to stand and smile
[40:01] and not move
[40:05] so that's what I do I learned it a long
[40:08] time ago in the Philippines so it's it's
[40:10] a trait that works so you just stand
[40:12] there and and we had a good time but we
[40:14] got to shake hands with a lot of the
[40:16] Believers and meet a lot of the family
[40:17] so it was really nice
[40:19] the next day we traveled somewhere else
[40:21] you hear some Believers showing up in a
[40:23] truck a truckload of sisters coming to
[40:26] the meeting and the church here was too
[40:28] small to house everybody so they had a
[40:30] wrecked an attempt and had the services
[40:32] in the tent they were having special
[40:33] services and this is where we were this
[40:37] day this is brother butaram and so he
[40:41] also recently came to the message
[40:44] brought us church and he's got a dynamic
[40:47] Ministry he's he's witnessing to a lot
[40:49] of the Sikhs and the Hindus and having a
[40:50] lot of conversions a lot of testimonies
[40:53] of healing and Supernatural things that
[40:55] the Lord's doing as a sign to the
[40:57] unbelievers and bringing them in and so
[40:59] he's on fire I think he's been uh I
[41:02] think he received a message like three
[41:03] or four years ago and he's out
[41:05] evangelizing everywhere and he's doing a
[41:06] great job
[41:08] this is part of the service
[41:12] well that club wasn't
[41:16] that blood
[41:20] that was a creative blood cells
[41:25] God himself
[41:28] and now through that blood
[41:31] making propitiation for our sins
[41:36] is the believer
[41:39] takes all of his sins away from angels
[41:43] [Applause]
[41:52] Zoe the next day which was Sunday
[41:54] morning we had church at brother
[41:56] rashawn's this is where they're in the
[41:58] fellowship hall now they put a little
[41:59] covering over one half of it and then
[42:02] they they have the service in there you
[42:04] can see in all the churches the women
[42:06] sit on one side uh the brothers sit on
[42:08] the other side most of them sit on the
[42:10] floor they have a few chairs in the back
[42:12] and so it's it's really unique just
[42:15] things we're not used to and you go and
[42:16] see it and they worship they respond to
[42:19] the word and it's really wonderful
[42:22] brother Joe because he was a special
[42:23] guest gift getting pushed up to the
[42:25] front we know brother Joe likes to sit
[42:27] up close but this was really close this
[42:29] is closer than he's used to being and so
[42:32] he's a little uncomfortable up there but
[42:33] he was an honored guest and a special
[42:35] guest and he kept sitting up on the
[42:36] platform so it was nice I told everybody
[42:39] I brought the smallest guy in our church
[42:40] with me
[42:42] so I got a few few funny looks at that
[42:45] and then I told him he was My Bodyguard
[42:47] so
[42:49] they probably think we're the land of
[42:51] the anakins you know
[42:52] but but it was nice to have him there
[42:55] watching my back he could watch the
[42:56] crowd if anything happened he would have
[42:57] sprung into action I know it so here we
[43:01] are at the service brother Sean brother
[43:02] Rashaan uh translated for every service
[43:04] so we had eight Services while we were
[43:07] there
[43:08] and he translated for them all he's
[43:10] great to work with he's just such a
[43:12] Harmony and a unity and he does a
[43:14] fantastic job I told him I said if I say
[43:16] anything wrong just fix it up I said
[43:18] I'll never know but he said no brother
[43:20] somebody will tell on me so
[43:23] so we had a good time together
[43:25] here's their Sunday school class all
[43:27] their Sunday school kids gathered there
[43:28] together it was neat to see them I was
[43:30] glad we got a picture of that and here
[43:33] they are practicing for a song this was
[43:34] Sunday Tuesday was the convention Monday
[43:36] was a day off for us so I got a clip
[43:39] later of them singing their song so they
[43:41] were cute
[43:42] and uh this is this is brother Joe
[43:46] having his pre-breakfast drink they told
[43:48] us that coconut water this is a young
[43:51] fresh coconut coconut water is really
[43:53] good for the health so every morning
[43:55] they cut the top off of a coconut cut a
[43:57] hole in it put a straw in it and we
[43:58] drank a whole coconut so we're gonna
[44:01] water every morning and it was good I
[44:03] liked it but your belly kind of sloshed
[44:05] a little bit after that you got a full
[44:06] belly of coconut water but but it was
[44:08] healthy so we got a picture of Joe ready
[44:10] for church this is Tuesday morning and
[44:12] he's so put together and he looks so
[44:14] nice and he's ready to go to the
[44:15] convention and they went ahead of me and
[44:18] I came in later and when I came in the
[44:20] tent was blazing hot baking and Joe had
[44:23] no tie his sleeves were rolled up shirt
[44:25] was on collar unbuttoned and he was
[44:27] Fanning himself with some paper so he
[44:29] looked nice before church but when I got
[44:31] in there it was a different picture he
[44:33] was in full-blown survival mode
[44:35] although I got a kick out of that
[44:37] here's the front this is the same front
[44:39] of the church that we looked at before
[44:40] but they erected a tent uh the tent to
[44:43] the right is for shoes everybody check
[44:45] their shoes they don't wear shoes into
[44:47] their church and so I preached Barefoot
[44:49] all every time but one day one day they
[44:51] wanted me to keep my shoes on and I was
[44:54] like I like preaching Barefoot I thought
[44:55] they have a mat up there and it's
[44:57] comfortable and I think could we put a
[44:59] mat here and kick my shoes on and get
[45:01] comfortable and just stay all day you
[45:03] know but it was it was good so you can
[45:06] see the Billboards up there and they
[45:08] they chartered buses churches that were
[45:11] hours away charter buses whole
[45:13] congregations game whole message
[45:15] believing congregations came like I said
[45:17] it was the first time they've all in
[45:18] that region been able to gather together
[45:20] in one place at the same time so it was
[45:22] a real exciting event for them to have
[45:25] Services together to worship together
[45:26] have Fellowship together and you know I
[45:29] didn't realize this at the beginning but
[45:31] as they kept explaining more of it to us
[45:33] I began to realize what what a
[45:36] interesting and unique time this was for
[45:38] all the Believers that were there
[45:40] this is a song special
[45:45] [Music]

[47:11] [Music]
[47:19] please
[47:24] [Music]
[47:26] [Applause]
[47:30] the name of it
[47:33] is
[47:41] [Music]
[47:57] amen so the kids song I could sing along
[47:59] with
[48:01] but it was nice because they really
[48:04] worship I mean whatever and that that
[48:06] song special with a young girl was
[48:08] singing that family was singing together
[48:10] brother Sean lean Dover started
[48:12] translating the words that that brother
[48:14] wrote that song He's a minister and he
[48:16] was with us a couple days earlier when
[48:18] we preached and I had preached a sermon
[48:20] on the tree of life and he wrote that
[48:22] song just after that sermon and that
[48:24] song is about there's two parts to the
[48:26] tree of life he and she male and female
[48:29] there's two parts to the tree of life he
[48:31] and me and those were all the words and
[48:33] the people were really responding to the
[48:35] song and really enjoying it and I had no
[48:38] idea what the song was about and he
[48:40] leaned over and tell me and it was a
[48:41] real blessing and the people were really
[48:42] worshiping because I was so unique I the
[48:45] music was so unique because it's
[48:47] instruments I've never heard before
[48:48] playing the way I've never heard I saw
[48:50] somebody get up to sing a special one
[48:52] time they looked back to the musicians
[48:53] and they said f sharp
[48:56] and I said I have never heard one of our
[48:58] musicians as long as they would ever say
[48:59] F sharp before I don't know if we
[49:01] normally play or singing that key but it
[49:03] was interesting for me so it was it was
[49:06] really neat to see him worship and and
[49:08] worship the way that they worship amen
[49:11] this is Brother bhutaram the church we
[49:15] were at that was Under the Tent he gave
[49:17] a testimony here in um
[49:20] in this testimony the the man standing
[49:22] next to him is part of his church a man
[49:24] that they prayed for that was healed and
[49:26] if you see in his hand he's holding an
[49:27] envelope and the envelope says MRI and
[49:30] CT scan on it and he's holding two scans
[49:33] in there one scan is where they found
[49:35] that he had a brain tumor and he'd went
[49:38] to three different hospitals and they
[49:39] all wanted to operate immediately they
[49:41] didn't want to treat it they wanted to
[49:43] operate on the brain tumor and and he
[49:45] didn't feel comfortable doing that and
[49:47] he wanted to pray so the church started
[49:49] praying and fasting together and asking
[49:51] God for an answer and the answer came
[49:53] through a sister who had a dream that he
[49:55] would be healed and sure enough the Lord
[49:57] completely delivered the man and they
[50:00] went back to the same doctor and got a
[50:02] second scan after some period of time
[50:04] and the scan showed he was completely
[50:06] clear no brain tumor so he came to the
[50:09] services with both scans in his hand so
[50:12] that was amazing to see and then he had
[50:14] a sister from his church stand up and
[50:16] she was standing there and he was
[50:17] sharing another testimony she had had a
[50:20] new liver disease
[50:21] and she had gotten jaundice really bad
[50:24] they went to the hospital and the doctor
[50:26] said there's nothing that we can do for
[50:28] you they sent her home to die and so she
[50:31] went back home and they started praying
[50:33] the whole congregation started praying
[50:34] together and she started recovering at
[50:36] home she got completely better she has
[50:39] no more problems no more symptoms and
[50:41] she's totally whole and she was standing
[50:42] testifying to the people that the Lord
[50:44] has healed her amen so this was a really
[50:47] good meeting and good testimonies
[50:48] because it was such a mixed audience
[50:50] there the majority of the crowd were
[50:52] message believers they were had gathered
[50:54] together for this convention but there
[50:56] was a still a good portion of people
[50:58] that were denominational Believers some
[51:00] seek some Hindus just people from the
[51:03] community that were there even the
[51:05] police came and sat and listened because
[51:07] they had registered with the local
[51:09] municipality the police came to make
[51:11] sure everything was in order they
[51:12] grabbed seats they sat they listened and
[51:15] I said praise the Lord it must be okay
[51:17] it must be fine so afterwards when we
[51:21] were fellowshipping and visiting one of
[51:23] the police officers came over towards me
[51:25] and and he kept taking out his phone and
[51:27] taking selfies with me and he said to me
[51:29] and take a selfie and get another pose
[51:31] have somebody take his his phone and
[51:33] take pictures of us together so I looked
[51:35] at brother Joe I said I don't think he's
[51:37] going to arrest me I think we're friends
[51:38] and Joe said yeah I think you're fine I
[51:40] think everything's okay now so we had a
[51:43] good time so it's such a mixed audience
[51:45] it was encouraging for the Believers but
[51:47] what a testimony of God's power and a
[51:49] living God that went out to that
[51:51] congregation
[51:53] they told me afterwards that they had
[51:55] over 2 000 people there and I'm a
[51:58] horrible judge of numbers I was thinking
[52:01] like half that or less and so they said
[52:04] they they served I think upwards of 2500
[52:08] people in the morning because they
[52:09] served a meal after the morning service
[52:10] and a meal after the evening service and
[52:14] then after the evening service they
[52:15] served around 2 000 people so you can
[52:18] see it was quite quite a crowd
[52:20] and I was totally stunned when I when I
[52:25] was going over there and they told me
[52:26] that they were gonna have a convention I
[52:27] had no idea the scale I had no idea what
[52:30] was going to happen and I'm glad I
[52:32] didn't know until after I got there but
[52:35] the Lord absolutely supernaturally
[52:38] blessed us I didn't know what to preach
[52:40] I didn't know how to preach with a mixed
[52:42] audience like that you've got the
[52:44] majority of her message Believers some
[52:46] are denominational Believers some aren't
[52:48] Christian at all and it's like what do
[52:51] you say I mean what do you say and God
[52:54] just give me an inspiration it just
[52:55] dropped in and I just began to preach
[52:57] that inspiration and afterwards
[53:00] brother Roshan we were going to lunch
[53:03] brother Marla booty said brother Chad he
[53:05] goes I don't know what you're going to
[53:07] preach the next service because there's
[53:08] two services this day he said you
[53:10] preached the whole Bible
[53:12] you said you were from Genesis to
[53:14] Revelation I said I don't know brother I
[53:16] don't know and brother Rashawn said he
[53:18] said that was the perfect message to
[53:20] preach to Believers and to introduce for
[53:23] those who aren't Believers he said it
[53:25] was perfect and I had no idea what to
[53:27] preach I had no idea how to handle this
[53:29] situation I was really seeking God for
[53:31] answers and God just given inspiration
[53:33] and we went to the pulpit with it and
[53:35] God I mean God just took us from Genesis
[53:38] all the way to Revelation and it was
[53:40] just perfect and I said Thank You Lord
[53:43] uh so thankful and so happy what God did
[53:48] this is the kitchen
[53:49] where you fix food for 2 000 people
[53:53] you can see the size of the pots for the
[53:55] evening meal
[53:57] so that was a massive Endeavor and they
[54:01] did a fantastic job this is the first
[54:03] time they've ever put together a
[54:04] convention like this the first time
[54:06] they've ever hosted as many people and
[54:08] the brothers that did it outstanding job
[54:11] they coordinated and they planned
[54:12] everything and the Lord really blessed
[54:14] their efforts it was a real success
[54:16] here's the tent they set up on the other
[54:18] side of the property and this is how
[54:20] they fed the people they had them all
[54:22] line up and sit on the floor they all
[54:23] got a plate and the brothers came along
[54:25] and dished food out to everyone and got
[54:28] everybody fed in a convenient way and
[54:31] they fed everybody who was there they
[54:32] fed breakfast to some who had traveled a
[54:34] long distance and got there early they
[54:36] fed lunch
[54:37] to a really large crowd and suffered to
[54:40] a really large crowd and they did a
[54:42] fantastic job
[54:43] here's the evening service under the
[54:46] lights the tent was huge I asked them I
[54:48] said how many people can fit in this
[54:49] tent they said three it'll hold 3 000
[54:52] people because when I looked out there I
[54:54] mean it looked like there was still room
[54:56] for other people and they said 3 000
[54:58] people and they said they had over 2 000
[55:00] there
[55:02] this is the where they served lunch and
[55:05] dinner to the ministers this is all the
[55:07] pastors and all the ministers that have
[55:08] gathered together from all the churches
[55:10] some of these ministers are
[55:11] denominational ministers most of them
[55:14] are message believing ministers
[55:16] but then we come to brother Victor this
[55:18] is a really interesting testimony
[55:21] and this is one that was really a
[55:23] highlight of the trip for me
[55:25] this brother is a denominational pastor
[55:28] and he lives about 30 kilometers from
[55:30] Brother rochon
[55:32] and we had a brother there that had
[55:34] traveled quite a distance and and he's a
[55:37] brother who's familiar with our church
[55:38] and by the way so many people send
[55:41] greetings I there's no way I could tell
[55:43] you how many and all their names but so
[55:45] many wanted us to greet the church and
[55:47] thank you for your stand in the word and
[55:48] for your support and they really have
[55:50] been blessed but he was one of those and
[55:53] he came and he wanted to be in
[55:55] Fellowship in the meetings he's a friend
[55:56] of brother rashons so we met him and we
[55:58] talked and he wanted to take us all out
[56:00] to dinner and there was a certain place
[56:01] he wanted to go but brother Rashawn said
[56:03] it's too far away and takes too much
[56:05] time we can't go and so they were trying
[56:07] to figure out where to go and they
[56:08] finally decided there's a place not too
[56:10] far away about 15 kilometers from
[56:12] brother rashawn's in the next city
[56:15] so we went there and we went to a KFC
[56:18] and so we went to a KFC in India and it
[56:22] was good I enjoyed it and so we went to
[56:25] the KFC and but it's it's like a little
[56:27] food court you go into the building and
[56:29] there's a couple different restaurants
[56:29] there's a Subway there's a KFC there's a
[56:32] couple things I couldn't pronounce and
[56:34] there was a few restaurants there so as
[56:36] we're walking in there's a large group
[56:38] of us walking in several ministers some
[56:41] other believers and their wives and this
[56:44] man pulls up on a motorcycle with him
[56:46] and his wife and his two sons and I
[56:48] noticed him when they pulled in because
[56:50] they went right past us and parked and
[56:51] we all went inside
[56:53] and brother Roshan and brother Jiva
[56:55] ratnam were outside talking just before
[56:57] they went in so we all went in and they
[56:58] were outside and he come walking up to
[57:01] them and he said later he told us he
[57:03] said he goes I just thought they look
[57:06] like pastors
[57:08] and he asked him he says are you pastors
[57:11] and they were shocked they said yeah we
[57:12] are pastors he said I'm a pastor and so
[57:15] they they greeted one another they
[57:17] introduced themselves they came inside
[57:18] and we all got acquainted with them they
[57:20] introduced them to all of us and we
[57:22] talked to him and he says I moved into
[57:24] the area four years ago to pastor this
[57:26] church
[57:27] and he said I haven't met one Christian
[57:30] Pastor in four years
[57:32] that I've had no fellowship and I've
[57:34] wanted fellowship and he said when I saw
[57:36] them brothers I just thought they were
[57:38] pastors and he says you could ask so
[57:41] many people you have a 99 chance of
[57:43] asking anyone are you a Christian Pastor
[57:45] they'd say no and he said I don't know
[57:46] how I knew I just knew and I asked and
[57:49] they were
[57:50] so they met they made contact they
[57:52] exchanged contact information and
[57:54] brother Rashaan invited him to the
[57:56] meetings and so well brother Rashawn and
[57:58] I were on the platform uh just before we
[58:01] went to the pulpit to preach in walk
[58:03] brother Victor and his wife and his two
[58:05] children to the meetings so we were so
[58:07] happy so we had the morning service
[58:10] we came back to the evening service and
[58:13] in the evening service they had moved
[58:14] him up to where all the ministers the
[58:16] ministers saddle to the left side of the
[58:17] platform and when I walked up to the
[58:19] platform he was the first one I saw so I
[58:21] I greeted him and he was really happy
[58:23] and smiling and so I could just see him
[58:25] just off the left corner of my eye and
[58:27] while I was preaching that second
[58:29] service while I was preaching I was
[58:32] preaching about the bride and the
[58:33] characteristics of the bride and she
[58:35] reflects uh the characteristics of
[58:37] Christ and I was going through all of
[58:38] that and this brother was having a good
[58:40] time in church I mean he was waving his
[58:42] hand he was getting excited and he was
[58:44] enjoying the service and so he was so
[58:46] excited after the service he came up to
[58:48] talk to us and he and he was saying he
[58:51] loved the word he said he loved the
[58:52] preaching and he was just really excited
[58:54] about everything that he had heard that
[58:56] day both services and then he began to
[58:58] share with us something else he said
[59:00] that day outside of KFC he said I wasn't
[59:04] going to go eat there because it's a
[59:06] little more expensive than what we
[59:07] wanted to spend we were going to go
[59:08] somewhere else and me and my wife taught
[59:10] and decided we were going to go to
[59:12] another place to eat he says I don't
[59:14] know why but I just had to come here and
[59:17] neither one of us wanted to come here it
[59:19] was more expensive we just had to come
[59:20] here and brother tan May wanted to take
[59:23] us all out to eat somewhere else but it
[59:24] was too far we couldn't go so we had to
[59:26] settle for coming here to eat and we
[59:28] both wound up here at the same time and
[59:31] that's where he met the first Christian
[59:33] pastors he's met in four years got
[59:35] contact information came to the meetings
[59:37] and then he told us this he said after I
[59:40] asked him if they were pastors when we
[59:42] walked into the building he said an
[59:44] audible voice spoke to me and said these
[59:46] are your friends
[59:48] and he went inside and he told his wife
[59:50] he had to go back outside and see who
[59:52] said that to him it was so loud and such
[59:53] an honorable voice and there was nobody
[59:55] and he said I believe it was God
[59:57] speaking to me tell me these are your
[59:59] friends so so I don't know what God's
[1:00:02] going to do with Victor but I was so
[1:00:04] blessed by that testimony and by his
[1:00:06] response to the word
[1:00:08] so pray for Victor brother Rashaan
[1:00:11] contacted him they made contact Victor
[1:00:13] and his wife and his children are going
[1:00:15] to come over and spend some time with
[1:00:18] brother Rashawn and his family sometime
[1:00:20] next week or within two weeks so just be
[1:00:23] praying for him I was so excited about
[1:00:26] this testimony and what God can do
[1:00:30] after the meetings we got together for a
[1:00:32] picture brother Joe and I brother Rasha
[1:00:34] and his wife and his three sons brother
[1:00:36] Hannah brother Titus and brother Moses
[1:00:39] so we really enjoyed their family their
[1:00:41] family was very sweet very precious very
[1:00:44] good to us and we really enjoyed our
[1:00:46] time in their home
[1:00:48] the last day that we ministered we left
[1:00:51] on Thursday but Wednesday we had a
[1:00:53] ministers meeting so this is The
[1:00:54] Minister's meetings at brother vikram's
[1:00:57] church and we traveled there as well and
[1:00:59] had the minister meeting I preached for
[1:01:01] the for The Minister's meeting and we
[1:01:03] got a picture afterwards of the brothers
[1:01:04] brother Rashawn told me that they were
[1:01:07] about 10 to 15 Brothers short because
[1:01:09] the brothers the day before were at the
[1:01:12] meetings until late at night traveled
[1:01:14] home and got home in the wee hours late
[1:01:16] hours and night wee hours in the morning
[1:01:17] and couldn't make it back but this is a
[1:01:19] normal monthly ministers meeting that
[1:01:21] they have with all these brothers plus
[1:01:22] an additional 10 or so more so it was a
[1:01:26] great opportunity to meet all the
[1:01:27] brothers like like I said even you
[1:01:30] probably can't tell but I have socked
[1:01:31] feet on it was great preached in my
[1:01:33] socks again we left all of our shoes
[1:01:35] outside and we all come out to get our
[1:01:38] shoes the people in the congregation had
[1:01:40] taken the shoes of all the ministers and
[1:01:42] Polished them all
[1:01:43] and I looked at my shoes they looked
[1:01:45] brand new I haven't polished my shoes
[1:01:46] since I bought them
[1:01:48] and so I I was really blessed by that
[1:01:52] and I was really thankful for that so if
[1:01:54] you look at my shoes today after church
[1:01:56] they look nice but it's not my doing the
[1:01:58] brothers there took care of us
[1:02:00] so that was the trip
[1:02:02] we thank you all for praying it was a
[1:02:05] busy time with a lot of services but we
[1:02:08] saw fruit
[1:02:09] you know it's always hard to leave home
[1:02:12] it's really hard for me to leave home
[1:02:14] it's hard to leave my family it's hard
[1:02:16] to leave the church and there's a lot of
[1:02:18] responsibilities a lot that I worry
[1:02:19] about and it's just hard to travel it's
[1:02:22] just really grueling our flights were
[1:02:24] brutal the times were brutal our bodies
[1:02:27] didn't react well to it it's really hard
[1:02:29] to travel hard to minister I had eight
[1:02:32] services and I was thinking if I stayed
[1:02:33] home it had only been three
[1:02:35] it's like what am I what am I doing and
[1:02:37] I could have slept in my bed and you
[1:02:40] know all the other things but I really
[1:02:42] felt God pulling us to go and when you
[1:02:44] go and you look back and you see fruit
[1:02:46] you see immediate fruit it makes it all
[1:02:49] so worth it then you realize that God
[1:02:51] was in it that pool was from God the
[1:02:54] results are God's but it's I'm so
[1:02:56] thankful he let us see some fruit while
[1:02:58] we were there because it was really very
[1:03:00] encouraging so we appreciate your
[1:03:02] prayers we thank God for all of you
[1:03:04] we're very glad to be home but I can say
[1:03:08] God was good and I know now why the
[1:03:10] devil attacked my tooth
[1:03:12] because there was something that God was
[1:03:14] going to do in that place and I was
[1:03:17] thankful to be part of it I mean let's
[1:03:19] all stand and read the scriptures I got
[1:03:21] a short thought that I'd like to share
[1:03:22] with you before we leave let's turn to
[1:03:24] Genesis chapter 3.
[1:03:32] Genesis chapter 3 and verse 8.
[1:03:42] Genesis 3 and 8 and they heard the voice
[1:03:45] of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in
[1:03:47] the cool of the day and Adam and his
[1:03:49] wife hid themselves from the presence of
[1:03:50] the Lord the Lord God amongst the Trees
[1:03:53] of the garden Spar heads and pray just
[1:03:56] for a moment Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:03:59] that we had an opportunity to share such
[1:04:01] a good report with your children the
[1:04:04] things that you have done Lord You've
[1:04:05] Been So merciful and gracious now as we
[1:04:08] look into your word Lord we ask that you
[1:04:10] would open the word for us that you
[1:04:12] would feed us by your hand and give us
[1:04:13] Lord the food that we have need of for
[1:04:16] we've come to commune with you Lord and
[1:04:18] dine at your table and I pray that you
[1:04:21] would be blessed and all that's said and
[1:04:22] done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:04:25] you all can have your seats again
[1:04:31] brother bear says in the message God's
[1:04:33] provided approach to Divine Fellowship
[1:04:35] he said God loves to fellowship with
[1:04:37] this creature
[1:04:38] in the Garden of Eden we are told that
[1:04:40] when a man walked in uprightness of God
[1:04:43] God come down in the cool of the evening
[1:04:45] and fellowship with his children so
[1:04:48] we've talked about this many times
[1:04:50] before but God built Eden for himself
[1:04:54] God when he rearranged creation
[1:04:58] when he spoke his word he took chaos and
[1:05:01] put it into an order and he took chaos
[1:05:03] and brought it into Eden which means
[1:05:05] pleasure then he planted a garden
[1:05:07] Eastern and Eden and he placed a man
[1:05:09] there and he placed the man and his wife
[1:05:10] over it and he went to take his rest
[1:05:12] because he was so satisfied with his
[1:05:14] work that he had accomplished his desire
[1:05:17] and brother bam tells us that God was
[1:05:21] alone Adam was alone because God was
[1:05:23] alone and he dwelt with the cherubims
[1:05:25] and he dwelt with the angels but he had
[1:05:27] no Fellowship because no one there
[1:05:29] understood him
[1:05:30] and so he had created man and he would
[1:05:33] come down in the cool of the evening and
[1:05:35] fellowship with man and God loved to
[1:05:37] fellowship with his creatures that he
[1:05:39] had created for his purpose and they
[1:05:41] were a fellowship of a father with his
[1:05:43] children and God loved that fellowship
[1:05:45] and it was his desire and his desire it
[1:05:49] was made manifest and it was was what
[1:05:51] God wanted and so I'd like to take for a
[1:05:54] subject if I could not servants but
[1:05:57] bride
[1:05:59] not a law but love
[1:06:01] not servants but bride not a law but
[1:06:05] love
[1:06:07] so God this was God's original desire
[1:06:11] and God didn't Institute a church he
[1:06:14] instituted Fellowship
[1:06:16] he didn't start with the law he didn't
[1:06:19] start with with codes and conducts all
[1:06:22] he started with was his word leave this
[1:06:25] alone it's not good for you everything
[1:06:27] else is fine leave this alone and so he
[1:06:30] established his word amen to keep the
[1:06:33] order of everything that had ordered and
[1:06:35] keep everything according to his desire
[1:06:36] and everything in Perfection all they
[1:06:39] had to do was keep the word of the Lord
[1:06:40] and we know that that there was a fall
[1:06:43] and we know God knew there was going to
[1:06:45] be a fall because there was a lamb slain
[1:06:47] from the foundation of the world there
[1:06:49] was names placed on a book from before
[1:06:50] the foundation of the world so God knew
[1:06:53] they would partake of the wrong tree
[1:06:55] so God knew that they would he had to
[1:06:57] make an allowance for that it all fit
[1:06:59] into his plan and we understand that's
[1:07:01] God's great plan so that he can reveal
[1:07:03] himself to his children to his
[1:07:05] attributes so that the fellowship can
[1:07:07] grow deeper through Revelation and
[1:07:08] understanding but but God's desire was
[1:07:12] to have Fellowship so he didn't start
[1:07:14] amen with with a book he didn't start
[1:07:16] with the law he didn't start with the
[1:07:18] church he didn't start with ceremony
[1:07:20] what he started with was a father and
[1:07:23] his children having Fellowship together
[1:07:25] it shows you what God desires amen God's
[1:07:28] not Desiring order and structure and
[1:07:31] form and all these things what God wants
[1:07:33] is fellowship with his attributes
[1:07:35] he wants to Fellowship what he could not
[1:07:38] find with the angels what he could not
[1:07:40] have when he dwelt alone with the
[1:07:41] cherubims and the angels he created man
[1:07:44] for fellowship and he wanted man he
[1:07:46] wanted to reveal himself to man so that
[1:07:48] man would understand God in an
[1:07:51] understanding and comprehending God he
[1:07:53] would now know God as a savior now no
[1:07:55] God as a Healer no God as a father the
[1:07:58] Angels knew him as the almighty God the
[1:07:59] creator of heavens and earth but they
[1:08:01] didn't understand him as Savior and
[1:08:03] healer and deliver provide her and all
[1:08:05] of these things but God was so much more
[1:08:07] than what the Angels could understand
[1:08:10] so he revealed himself amen even through
[1:08:13] the fall he revealed himself to his
[1:08:15] children so that that we would know God
[1:08:17] so that we could have fellowship with
[1:08:19] God because God loves fellowship and
[1:08:22] wanted Fellowship amen God has divided
[1:08:24] himself in the attributes so that he
[1:08:26] could Fellowship because the one that he
[1:08:28] was going to have Fellowship was within
[1:08:29] him
[1:08:30] because Adam was alone Adam wanted
[1:08:33] Fellowship but everything that was
[1:08:34] created and brought out of the Dust of
[1:08:36] the ground and presented to Adam to see
[1:08:38] whether there'd be a suitable help me
[1:08:40] not one was found there was nothing that
[1:08:42] he could fellowship with because none of
[1:08:44] the animals were like him or could
[1:08:46] understand him so there was no True
[1:08:48] Fellowship he could not find a suitable
[1:08:50] help me because his True Fellowship his
[1:08:53] help meet was within him was part of him
[1:08:55] and it would have to come out of him be
[1:08:58] expressed in a form and be United back
[1:09:00] to him and that would be Fellowship
[1:09:02] perfect Fellowship beautiful Fellowship
[1:09:04] amen and it would be amen it would be a
[1:09:07] display of the seventh seal God's great
[1:09:09] plan and God's Great desire was
[1:09:12] expressed in creation and now God was
[1:09:15] alone but he was alone with his thoughts
[1:09:18] with his attributes with his children
[1:09:20] amen and he was going to portion himself
[1:09:22] out because the fellowship he sought was
[1:09:25] within him he was going to bring him out
[1:09:26] into another expression and then unite
[1:09:29] it to himself again to have the
[1:09:31] fellowship that God desired
[1:09:34] so
[1:09:35] we see now that the fall broke that
[1:09:38] fellowship and God began to restore it
[1:09:40] through the shed blood of an innocent
[1:09:42] lamb now God came down and and shed the
[1:09:45] blood of a lamb to cover as a covering
[1:09:48] as a substitute for his Fallen children
[1:09:50] so that he can begin restoring
[1:09:52] fellowship and we know he went back to
[1:09:54] remaking the Masterpiece that had fallen
[1:09:57] and we go to Genesis chapter five let's
[1:09:59] look at Genesis chapter 5.
[1:10:05] in verse 21
[1:10:11] Genesis 5 and 21 and Enoch lived 60 and
[1:10:14] five years and begotten Methuselah and
[1:10:17] Enoch walked with God after he begotten
[1:10:19] Methuselah 300 years and he got sons and
[1:10:21] daughters
[1:10:23] and all the days of Enoch were 365 years
[1:10:26] and Enoch walked with God and he was not
[1:10:29] for God took him
[1:10:32] and the Garden of Eden God would come
[1:10:33] down in the cool of the evening and walk
[1:10:35] with his children
[1:10:37] but that Fellowship was broken here we
[1:10:39] find Enoch VII from Adam and in the
[1:10:43] seventh dispensation of the Seventh
[1:10:45] Generation from Adam which is a type of
[1:10:47] the seventh Church age something is
[1:10:49] restored that was lost in Eden and now
[1:10:52] God once again is walking with one of
[1:10:54] his children
[1:10:55] he's walking with Enoch showing that in
[1:10:57] the seventh Church age there's going to
[1:10:59] be a restoration of Fellowship between
[1:11:01] God and man and man could walk with God
[1:11:04] again and now God is walking with Enoch
[1:11:07] and and Enoch was not for God took him
[1:11:11] it has turned to Hebrews chapter 11 and
[1:11:14] read about this in Hebrews 11.
[1:11:22] Hebrews chapter 11
[1:11:25] and verse 5.
[1:11:32] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:11:35] should not see death it was not found
[1:11:37] because God had translated him for
[1:11:40] before his translation he had this
[1:11:42] testimony that he pleased God
[1:11:47] look at the next verse but without faith
[1:11:50] is impossible to please him
[1:11:53] so how was it that Enoch had this
[1:11:55] testimony that he pleased God how could
[1:11:57] he walk with God how could God take him
[1:12:01] because he pleased God but without faith
[1:12:04] it is impossible to please God and We
[1:12:07] Know by the message that faith is a
[1:12:09] revelation so Enoch had a revelation and
[1:12:12] that Revelation was how he pleased God
[1:12:15] and what was Enoch's Revelation Enoch
[1:12:17] had the revelation of the whole Bible
[1:12:19] because Enoch built the Pyramid and the
[1:12:21] pyramid is the second Bible
[1:12:23] so the first Bible is written in the
[1:12:25] stars the second's written in the
[1:12:26] pyramid and and he knew the revelation
[1:12:29] of the word and he knew that the
[1:12:31] Capstone must be a hidden Mystery and he
[1:12:33] didn't put it on Amen because Enoch knew
[1:12:36] the plan of God Enoch had Revelation on
[1:12:39] the word and by faith he pleased God
[1:12:42] because God had given him a revelation
[1:12:44] and he was walking in his Revelation and
[1:12:47] he had this testimony that before God
[1:12:49] took him that he pleased God but without
[1:12:52] faith it's impossible to please God you
[1:12:54] can't please God by works you can't
[1:12:56] please God by deed it's without faith
[1:12:58] it's impossible to please God how do you
[1:13:01] please God by faith and faith is a
[1:13:02] revelation what's a revelation based off
[1:13:04] it's based off the word of God Amen and
[1:13:08] Enoch had that Revelation and that
[1:13:11] Revelation to me is what put him in
[1:13:13] close contact with God God had revealed
[1:13:16] himself to Enon and Enoch was walking
[1:13:18] with God
[1:13:22] Enoch had the mystery had the revelation
[1:13:25] of the word what do we have in this day
[1:13:27] we have the revelation of the word amen
[1:13:29] and the hidden Mystery has been revealed
[1:13:32] in this day and what does that do amen
[1:13:34] it puts us in a place where by faith we
[1:13:37] can please God and we can walk like
[1:13:39] Enoch walk we can walk again with God
[1:13:42] because we walk by Revelation because
[1:13:44] God desired to reveal himself to his
[1:13:46] children so that he could have
[1:13:48] fellowship with his children
[1:13:50] now God is known by his creation known
[1:13:55] by his children
[1:13:56] brother bam said in the God of this evil
[1:13:58] age he said the word was from the
[1:14:01] beginning God's plan
[1:14:03] but God revealed by Revelation the very
[1:14:05] thing that he Vindicated and punctuated
[1:14:07] that that was right not religion not an
[1:14:11] altar not belonging to church not making
[1:14:14] a sacrifice not being sincere but by the
[1:14:17] revelation of the word of God so what
[1:14:19] was God's plan from the beginning
[1:14:21] revelation of the word
[1:14:23] that's what that's what Abel did to
[1:14:26] please God Abel by faith offered a more
[1:14:29] excellent sacrifice what was his faith
[1:14:31] he caught the revelation of what
[1:14:33] happened in the garden and why God had
[1:14:35] slain a lamb in the garden and he knew
[1:14:37] it was blood was the problem and now he
[1:14:39] offered blood as the substitute he what
[1:14:42] was it it was an expression of his faith
[1:14:44] which was based on a revelation because
[1:14:46] faith is a revelation of the word of God
[1:14:49] and now Abel's sacrifice was accepted
[1:14:52] and he could commune with God Keynes was
[1:14:54] rejected because Cain had no Revelation
[1:14:57] no understanding of God he had his own
[1:14:59] understanding and that brought a
[1:15:01] separation but Revelation brought a
[1:15:03] Unity
[1:15:06] and Able by faith offered a more
[1:15:09] excellent sacrificed and came
[1:15:12] let's look at James chapter 2.
[1:15:17] as we go down through time God then
[1:15:19] would call
[1:15:21] Abraham
[1:15:23] and I want to look at the designation of
[1:15:26] Abraham
[1:15:35] Enoch we were never told of
[1:15:38] what Enoch did to please God
[1:15:41] Abel it looks like Abel please go on by
[1:15:45] making a sacrifice but according to the
[1:15:47] word he pleased God by having faith
[1:15:50] because his faith is what produced his
[1:15:53] sacrifice it wasn't the sacrifice it was
[1:15:56] the faith behind the sacrifice that
[1:15:58] pleased God it was the revelation of the
[1:16:01] word that pleased God
[1:16:03] in Revelation I'm sorry James chapter 2.
[1:16:07] James chapter 2 verse 22.
[1:16:11] it says seeth Thou how Faith wrought
[1:16:14] with his works and by works Faith made
[1:16:17] perfect and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:16:19] with saith Abraham believed God and it
[1:16:22] was imputed to have imputed unto him for
[1:16:25] righteousness and he was called the
[1:16:27] friend of God
[1:16:29] Abraham believed God what did he believe
[1:16:32] it didn't say Abraham believed in God
[1:16:35] most of the world believed in God but
[1:16:38] Abraham believed God Amen what was it he
[1:16:41] pleased God by faith he believed God he
[1:16:44] believed what God told him he believed
[1:16:46] what God Said the Revelation for his day
[1:16:49] he received it from the Lord and he
[1:16:51] believed it and he acted upon it and he
[1:16:53] pleased the Lord and the Lord said it
[1:16:55] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[1:16:57] what the fact that he believed the word
[1:16:59] of God not his deeds his deeds were an
[1:17:02] outcropping of his faith
[1:17:04] Deeds without faith are not salvation
[1:17:07] but Faith produces the Deeds
[1:17:11] God's not looking for Works God's
[1:17:13] looking for Faith but your faith is
[1:17:15] Manifest in your Works your Works
[1:17:17] manifest your faith so there's been a
[1:17:19] confusion in religion and Christianity
[1:17:22] all down through even Judaism all the
[1:17:24] way down through there's been a
[1:17:25] confusion that I can please God by Deeds
[1:17:28] Deeds don't please God faith pleases God
[1:17:31] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:17:33] God the Deeds we do brother Benham said
[1:17:36] are our love back to him amen his
[1:17:39] Revelation to us is his love to us his
[1:17:42] expression to us our works are our love
[1:17:45] back to him but that's not how we gain
[1:17:47] acceptance any more than how Abel gained
[1:17:49] acceptance Cain worked harder than Abel
[1:17:52] and what did Abel do Abel believed God
[1:17:55] Amen he caught the revelation of the
[1:17:57] hour and he acted upon the Revelation
[1:17:59] and he was accepted his sacrifice was
[1:18:01] accepted he was brought into communion
[1:18:03] with God Amen and he pleased God
[1:18:06] Kane worked harder did more Deeds but
[1:18:09] his deeds were not accepted not because
[1:18:12] they weren't good deeds not because he
[1:18:14] didn't work hard not because he wasn't
[1:18:16] sincere but he had no revelation
[1:18:21] so by faith
[1:18:23] and without faith it's impossible to
[1:18:25] please God it wasn't what Abraham did
[1:18:28] it's what Abraham believed he believed
[1:18:31] God and it was imputed or placed upon
[1:18:33] him for righteousness he was declared
[1:18:36] righteous because he believed God and
[1:18:38] then was called the friend of God
[1:18:41] God
[1:18:43] we never think about God wanting a
[1:18:46] friend
[1:18:48] God is the one who called Abraham his
[1:18:51] friend Abraham didn't call God his
[1:18:53] friend Abraham didn't say God's my
[1:18:55] friend no it was God who called Abraham
[1:18:57] his friend
[1:18:59] showing that God wanted Abraham for a
[1:19:02] friend
[1:19:04] because God is interested in the
[1:19:06] relationship not just the D's not the
[1:19:09] acts not the ceremony not the ritual but
[1:19:11] God is looking for Fellowship amen
[1:19:13] somebody that loves them somebody that
[1:19:16] he can express himself to that will
[1:19:18] receive that expression
[1:19:20] that's what God wanted from the
[1:19:21] beginning
[1:19:22] if we could turn to Isaiah
[1:19:25] I'd like to read this in Isaiah
[1:19:28] what God says about Abraham
[1:19:37] the word of God is so rich and so
[1:19:39] perfect
[1:19:41] I you would never think about God
[1:19:43] wanting a friend
[1:19:47] we think God wants servants but he had
[1:19:49] servants and angels
[1:19:51] and then God want to worship but he had
[1:19:53] worship and angels He had servants he
[1:19:56] had worship he had he was glorified he
[1:19:59] had all of that with the Angelic host
[1:20:01] and that realm and of angels he wanted
[1:20:03] something more than just to be worshiped
[1:20:06] he wanted something more than to be
[1:20:07] served he wanted a relationship and the
[1:20:10] first relationship he expressed with his
[1:20:12] creation was that of a father and his
[1:20:14] children and brother Branham would
[1:20:15] dramatize it he said come down in the
[1:20:17] cool of the evening and he says children
[1:20:19] have you enjoyed the creation that I
[1:20:21] made for you today he was enjoying the
[1:20:24] fellowship he was sharing with his
[1:20:26] attributes and they were sharing back
[1:20:28] with him as they would Express back to
[1:20:30] him all that they saw and all they
[1:20:31] experienced and God loved it
[1:20:34] strong
[1:20:35] I'm so glad the prophet of God Amen
[1:20:38] could catch these glimpses and dramatize
[1:20:40] these things to break us away from
[1:20:42] traditional thinking and break us away
[1:20:44] from ritualistic thinking and religious
[1:20:47] Notions and bring us back to what God
[1:20:49] wanted from the beginning amen because
[1:20:51] what he wanted at the beginning is what
[1:20:52] he will have at the end and what he
[1:20:54] wants out of his bride amen is not
[1:20:57] strict conformance to an ordinance he
[1:20:58] wants somebody that loves him for who he
[1:21:01] is that can catch who he is by
[1:21:03] Revelation and they can come into
[1:21:04] communion
[1:21:08] Isaiah 41 and 8.
[1:21:21] I say 41-8 but thou Israel are my
[1:21:24] servant Jacob whom I have chosen the
[1:21:27] Seed of Abraham my friend
[1:21:31] I would love to see a scripture written
[1:21:33] like that with my name attached to it
[1:21:36] with God speaking through Isaiah saying
[1:21:39] Jacob's my servant the Seed of Abraham
[1:21:41] my friend
[1:21:43] what did Abraham do to deserve this
[1:21:46] friendship that Abraham find God or did
[1:21:48] God find Abraham
[1:21:50] did Abraham uh revealed the word to
[1:21:53] himself or did God reveal the word to
[1:21:55] Abraham it was God revealing to Abraham
[1:21:58] Abraham believed God it was imputed unto
[1:22:01] them righteousness for righteousness and
[1:22:02] he was called the friend of God who
[1:22:04] called him the friend of God God called
[1:22:06] him his friend he said Abraham's my
[1:22:09] friend
[1:22:10] you know so many people I remember in
[1:22:13] school everybody wanted to have friends
[1:22:14] you know everybody wants to have the
[1:22:15] most friends and be the most popular and
[1:22:17] you call all kinds of people your friend
[1:22:19] but they're not your friend unless they
[1:22:21] call your friend back
[1:22:22] you can claim a thousand friends Abraham
[1:22:25] could say God's my friend but What
[1:22:26] mattered the most was God said Abraham's
[1:22:28] my friend
[1:22:32] praise be to God
[1:22:34] let's go to Exodus 19.
[1:22:52] Exodus 19.
[1:22:56] we know that God kept his promise to
[1:22:58] Abraham and delivered his children out
[1:23:00] of Egypt
[1:23:01] and God was bringing the children of
[1:23:04] Israel to himself because he wanted to
[1:23:07] unite with them
[1:23:08] he was going to marry them he was giving
[1:23:10] them in Exodus 19 he's given them the
[1:23:12] proposal of a covenant that if they will
[1:23:14] join into this Covenant he will become
[1:23:16] one with them and in Exodus 19 Verse 3
[1:23:19] it says
[1:23:21] and Moses went up unto God
[1:23:23] and the Lord called unto him out of the
[1:23:25] mountain saying thus shalt thou say to
[1:23:27] the house of Jacob
[1:23:29] and tell the children of Israel you have
[1:23:31] seen what I did unto the Egyptians and
[1:23:33] how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and
[1:23:35] brought you unto myself
[1:23:37] so
[1:23:38] it wasn't the nation of Israel seeking
[1:23:41] after God God went and got them and bore
[1:23:43] them On Eagle's Wings the wings of a
[1:23:45] prophet a prophetic Ministry and he said
[1:23:48] I brought you to myself this was all
[1:23:50] God's doing I went to fetch you and
[1:23:52] redeem you and I sent Moses and I
[1:23:54] brought you to myself
[1:23:57] and he says I brought you into myself
[1:23:59] verse five now therefore if you will
[1:24:01] obey my voice indeed and keep my
[1:24:03] Covenant then you shall be a peculiar
[1:24:05] treasure unto me above all people for
[1:24:07] all the Earth is mine and you shall be
[1:24:10] unto me a kingdom of priest and a holy
[1:24:12] nation these are the words which thou
[1:24:14] shall speak unto the children of Israel
[1:24:16] and Moses came and called for the Elders
[1:24:18] of the people and laid before their
[1:24:20] faces all these words which the Lord
[1:24:21] commanded them and all the people
[1:24:23] answered together and said all that the
[1:24:25] Lord has spoken we will do and Moses
[1:24:27] returned the words of the people unto
[1:24:29] the Lord
[1:24:31] God had fetched them to himself
[1:24:34] he had gathered the children the seed of
[1:24:37] his friend Abraham the natural seed of
[1:24:39] his friend Abraham and he went and
[1:24:41] redeemed them and he brought them to
[1:24:43] himself and he brought them to Sinai and
[1:24:45] there on Sinai he's making a proposal to
[1:24:47] them he said if you will if you will
[1:24:50] heed to my voice and keep my
[1:24:51] Commandments you will be a peculiar
[1:24:53] treasure to me above all the peoples of
[1:24:55] the earth and you will be a a kingdom a
[1:24:58] nation of priests
[1:25:00] and they said we'll do it so Moses
[1:25:02] brings the proposal from the groom down
[1:25:04] to the to the bride to the people they
[1:25:06] agree and he takes their answer back to
[1:25:08] the Lord and the Lord says now now set
[1:25:11] up and prepare prepare yourselves for
[1:25:13] after three days I'm coming down to
[1:25:16] speak to the people and and they make
[1:25:18] preparation and he said after three days
[1:25:20] I'll speak to the people and when they
[1:25:22] hear the trumpet sound long amen have
[1:25:24] them come up to me into the mountain
[1:25:26] and we know that that God did exactly
[1:25:29] what he said he would do but the sight
[1:25:31] was so fearful so terrifying the
[1:25:34] mountain quaked and it was on fire and
[1:25:36] it was so terrifying that Moses said he
[1:25:38] exceedingly trembled and quaked
[1:25:41] and when God sounded out the trumpet
[1:25:44] blast and the trumpet blast was when he
[1:25:46] gave the Ten Commandments that was his
[1:25:47] Covenant with Israel and you pick it up
[1:25:49] in Deuteronomy chapter 5 and it said he
[1:25:52] spoke this and added none there unto
[1:25:54] there was going to be no other law there
[1:25:56] was going to be no book of ordinance
[1:25:57] this was the Covenant you keep this
[1:25:59] Covenant with me you'll be my people
[1:26:01] I'll be your God we'll be connected
[1:26:03] together and you'll be a nation of
[1:26:05] priests
[1:26:06] and when he told them is when they heard
[1:26:08] his voice when he sounded out the Ten
[1:26:11] Commandments and blasted it forth in the
[1:26:13] long blast they were to come up to him
[1:26:15] unto the mountain and when the trumpet
[1:26:18] sounded long and it blasted and the
[1:26:20] voice of God spoke Moses LED them out of
[1:26:23] the camp to go to the mountain and they
[1:26:24] all ran the other way
[1:26:26] they ran far away they ran away from the
[1:26:30] voice of God they ran away from the
[1:26:32] presence of the God because it was too
[1:26:34] terrifying amen and this is when they
[1:26:37] broke the Covenant
[1:26:39] and they said to Moses you go up
[1:26:43] we have heard the voice of God we cannot
[1:26:46] bear it anymore unless we die you go up
[1:26:48] and whatever he tells you will do
[1:26:52] originally God only had this Covenant
[1:26:55] these Ten Commandments to give to Israel
[1:26:57] and and the Bible says and he added none
[1:27:00] there too that was it that was the
[1:27:02] original
[1:27:03] but they couldn't bear the voice of the
[1:27:05] Lord in the presence of God it was so
[1:27:07] mighty and so powerful and we know this
[1:27:09] was all according to God's plan
[1:27:10] everything worked out so he could
[1:27:12] display himself that's why he came down
[1:27:14] in such a fashion amen but they ran away
[1:27:16] breaking the Covenant asking a man to go
[1:27:19] stand between them and God when God said
[1:27:21] come to me
[1:27:23] and now they asked a man to go stand in
[1:27:25] between and asked the man to get
[1:27:28] Commandments and you get Commandments
[1:27:30] and then we'll keep the Commandments
[1:27:33] and God says they spoke well that's what
[1:27:35] we'll do
[1:27:37] and then God gave a law a book of law a
[1:27:42] book of ordinances that he wasn't
[1:27:43] originally going to add to the Covenant
[1:27:46] and now Israel when they were going to
[1:27:49] be a peculiar people
[1:27:51] they were going to be a nation of
[1:27:53] priests
[1:27:54] they now had to establish the priesthood
[1:27:57] and Temple Worship in the Tabernacle and
[1:28:01] ordinances and laws and God put gave
[1:28:04] them exactly what they asked for they
[1:28:07] said you give you go get the
[1:28:08] Commandments we'll keep the Commandments
[1:28:10] and God was going to prove to them that
[1:28:12] you can't keep the Commandments you
[1:28:14] can't be holy you can't do it yourself
[1:28:15] you can't do without me at the end of
[1:28:18] this you'll know that you need me
[1:28:20] and that was the whole purpose of the
[1:28:22] law
[1:28:23] and and God gave him exactly what they
[1:28:26] asked for so that they could find out
[1:28:28] that there was no righteousness no
[1:28:30] ability to be righteous in themselves
[1:28:32] they did not have the ability to keep
[1:28:34] all the law because they were corrupt
[1:28:36] amen and God wants his people to come to
[1:28:39] his voice to obey his voice and come to
[1:28:42] him
[1:28:43] and not send somebody in between and not
[1:28:46] ask for a book of ordinances or laws but
[1:28:48] just to come to his voice that's what
[1:28:50] God wants
[1:28:52] and so for hundreds and hundreds of
[1:28:56] years a thousands of years they they
[1:28:58] worship God by the book of ordinances
[1:29:02] by the law
[1:29:03] and Moses gave them the law they said
[1:29:06] they would keep it and no one was able
[1:29:07] to keep it all
[1:29:09] and now they became servants
[1:29:14] they were going to be as peculiar people
[1:29:15] but now because they said we'll obey the
[1:29:19] Commandments he gave the book of
[1:29:21] ordinances and now they became a nation
[1:29:23] of servants
[1:29:24] where Abraham was their friend was God's
[1:29:27] friend now they become God's servants
[1:29:31] and let's look at Romans chapter 3
[1:29:32] together I want to look at a couple
[1:29:34] scriptures
[1:29:35] here in the New Testament
[1:29:44] Romans chapter 3 verse 19.
[1:29:56] Romans 19 or sorry Romans 3 19 chapter 3
[1:30:00] verse 19.
[1:30:02] now we know
[1:30:03] that what thinks over the law saith that
[1:30:06] saith in them who are under the law that
[1:30:08] every mouth may be stopped and all the
[1:30:11] world may become guilty before God so
[1:30:13] why did God give a law he gave a law to
[1:30:16] make every mouth be silent be stopped
[1:30:19] and every person become guilty
[1:30:23] he wasn't going to require this in the
[1:30:25] beginning if they would have just come
[1:30:26] to his voice
[1:30:28] but they asked for it and he gave it to
[1:30:30] him and it was a lesson that had to be
[1:30:32] learned this was something that God had
[1:30:34] to do to display himself
[1:30:36] verse 20 therefore by the Deeds of the
[1:30:39] law there shall no flesh be justified in
[1:30:42] his side for by the law is the knowledge
[1:30:44] of sin
[1:30:46] let's go to Galatians chapter 3.
[1:30:54] Galatians chapter 3.
[1:30:57] verse 21.
[1:31:03] okay
[1:31:06] Galatians 3 21 is the law then against
[1:31:09] the promise of God God forbid for if
[1:31:12] there had been a law given which could
[1:31:14] have given life verily righteousness
[1:31:16] should have been by the law
[1:31:18] but the scripture hath concluded all
[1:31:21] under sin that the Promise by faith of
[1:31:23] Jesus Christ might be given to them that
[1:31:25] believe
[1:31:26] but before Faith came we were kept under
[1:31:29] law shot up into the faith which should
[1:31:31] afterwards be revealed wherefore the law
[1:31:33] was our Schoolmaster to bring us unto
[1:31:35] Christ that we might be justified by
[1:31:38] faith but after that faith has come we
[1:31:41] are no longer under a Schoolmaster fear
[1:31:44] all the children of God by faith in
[1:31:46] Jesus in Christ Jesus for as many of you
[1:31:48] have been baptized unto Christ have put
[1:31:50] on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek
[1:31:52] there is neither Bond nor free there is
[1:31:54] neither male nor female for you're all
[1:31:57] one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ
[1:31:59] then are you Abraham's seed and heirs
[1:32:01] according to the promise so how are you
[1:32:04] Christ by faith how are you righteous by
[1:32:06] faith not by the Deeds of the law but by
[1:32:09] faith righteousness is imputed unto you
[1:32:11] the same way it was Abraham
[1:32:13] and so God through the sacrifice of
[1:32:17] Jesus Christ he paid the penalty of sin
[1:32:20] he fulfilled the law he kept he kept
[1:32:22] every jot and Tittle fulfilling the
[1:32:24] whole law of God and now God was opening
[1:32:27] the way of Grace once again and what was
[1:32:29] it going to require it was going to
[1:32:30] require believing God Amen if you
[1:32:33] believe God Amen that's faith and
[1:32:36] without faith is impossible to please
[1:32:37] God keeping the law alone was not
[1:32:40] pleasing to God Amen but keeping it
[1:32:43] according to faith in God was pleasing
[1:32:45] to God
[1:32:48] so the law was a school Master to teach
[1:32:51] us that we had to have Christ
[1:32:54] that we could not do it there was no
[1:32:56] righteousness obtained by the law by
[1:32:59] keeping the law itself
[1:33:01] life could not come by just the law it
[1:33:03] came by faith all the way through it's
[1:33:05] been by faith
[1:33:07] let's look at what Jesus says in Mark
[1:33:09] chapter 12.
[1:33:16] mark 12.
[1:33:20] in verse 29.
[1:33:25] Mark chapter 12 29
[1:33:27] and Jesus answered him
[1:33:30] the first of all the Commandments is
[1:33:32] hero Israel the Lord our God is one Lord
[1:33:34] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:33:36] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[1:33:39] with all thy mind with all thy strength
[1:33:41] this is the first commandment
[1:33:44] and the second is like namely this Thou
[1:33:46] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there
[1:33:49] is none other commandment greater than
[1:33:51] these
[1:33:52] so he was asked by one of the scribes
[1:33:54] what was the uh the the first
[1:33:57] commandment of all and he says the first
[1:34:00] commandment of all is the Lord our God
[1:34:02] is one Lord and you shall love him
[1:34:05] this is the Commandment of God to know
[1:34:07] that the Lord is one and you shall love
[1:34:09] him
[1:34:11] with all your heart with all your soul
[1:34:13] with all your mind with all your
[1:34:15] strength that's the greatest commandment
[1:34:17] is to know God and to love him
[1:34:20] the second is likened to the verse or
[1:34:23] similar to the verse to love your
[1:34:24] neighbor as yourself
[1:34:27] and Jesus says there is none other
[1:34:28] commandment greater than these
[1:34:31] let's look at Romans 13. it's going to
[1:34:34] tell us the same thing
[1:34:37] the Apostle Paul will write here in
[1:34:38] Romans chapter 13.
[1:34:46] Romans 13 and verse 8.
[1:34:50] it says oh no man anything but to love
[1:34:53] one another for he that loveth another
[1:34:55] hath fulfilled the law
[1:35:00] they couldn't keep the law but he says
[1:35:02] now if you love one another you fulfill
[1:35:04] the law
[1:35:05] for this Thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:35:08] Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal
[1:35:11] Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou
[1:35:13] shalt not coven if there be any other
[1:35:15] commandment it is briefly comprehended
[1:35:17] in this saying namely Thou shalt love
[1:35:20] thy neighbor as thyself
[1:35:23] love worketh no will to his neighbor
[1:35:25] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[1:35:29] law
[1:35:32] no law
[1:35:34] but love
[1:35:36] brother bear says we have no law but
[1:35:38] love no Creed but Christ no book but the
[1:35:42] Bible
[1:35:43] over and over he says we have no law but
[1:35:45] love because the law is fulfilled in
[1:35:47] this that you love your neighbor as
[1:35:49] yourself
[1:35:49] the first commandment is know the Lord
[1:35:51] God as one Lord and that you should love
[1:35:54] him with all your heart with all your
[1:35:56] mind with all your soul with all your
[1:35:57] strength and the second one likened to
[1:36:00] the first one is love your neighbor as
[1:36:01] yourself by this all the law is
[1:36:04] fulfilled in this God didn't need to
[1:36:08] give them all the ordinances of
[1:36:09] Commandments he only proved in them they
[1:36:11] couldn't keep it what they needed was
[1:36:13] the love of God Amen and then you could
[1:36:14] fulfill all the Commandments
[1:36:17] foreign
[1:36:18] look at Romans chapter 5.
[1:36:29] Romans chapter 5 verse 1.
[1:36:32] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:36:35] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:36:36] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[1:36:39] by faith and to his grace wherein we
[1:36:41] stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory
[1:36:42] of God and not only so but we glory in
[1:36:45] Tribulation also knowing that
[1:36:46] tribulation work is patience and
[1:36:48] patience experience and experience hope
[1:36:50] and hope maketh not a shame because the
[1:36:52] love of God the love of God which is the
[1:36:56] Fulfillment of all the law
[1:36:57] the love of God is shed abroad in our
[1:37:00] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[1:37:02] unto us
[1:37:03] by being born again and United with
[1:37:06] Christ by being baptized by spiritual
[1:37:08] baptism the Holy Ghost into Christ the
[1:37:10] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:37:12] and that's the love of God that is the
[1:37:14] Fulfillment of all the law
[1:37:16] because God's not interested in
[1:37:18] ordinances God's not interested in
[1:37:20] rituals not gone interested in getting
[1:37:22] everybody to line up to the queue what
[1:37:25] he wants is he wants a people who are
[1:37:27] like him and God is love amen and the
[1:37:29] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:37:31] by the Holy Ghost so that now we don't
[1:37:34] need all the ordinances what we need is
[1:37:36] the love of God should have brought in
[1:37:37] our hearts by the Holy Ghost so that we
[1:37:39] can act like God and so fulfill the law
[1:37:44] it's it's it's not it's not religion
[1:37:49] but it says it's not an altar it's not
[1:37:51] religion it's not a sacrifice it's not
[1:37:53] being sincere but it's the revelation of
[1:37:55] the word and he is the word amen it's
[1:37:58] the revelation of God which brings us
[1:38:00] back into Union with almighty God and
[1:38:02] God is love and his love has done all of
[1:38:05] his works and his love has declared the
[1:38:07] law and the Fulfillment of the law is
[1:38:09] found in the love of God
[1:38:12] so there's not ordinances that he wants
[1:38:14] it's not a Commandment that keeps us
[1:38:16] rigidly in line but is the love of God
[1:38:19] should have brought in our hearts that
[1:38:20] keeps us in line not a rigid adherence
[1:38:22] to a commandment but a desire of the
[1:38:25] heart to please God
[1:38:27] and the Very nature of Jesus Christ
[1:38:29] Living in us bringing us lining up to
[1:38:32] the word amen not even maybe knowing
[1:38:35] what the Commandment is but having the
[1:38:37] nature of the Commandment Giver on the
[1:38:39] inside when the love of God shall have
[1:38:41] brought in our hearts brings our
[1:38:42] attitude brings our conduct brings our
[1:38:45] nature in line with God's love and we
[1:38:47] are fulfilling all the law without
[1:38:49] having to understand a strict ordinance
[1:38:52] of the law
[1:38:57] people love religion
[1:39:00] people love ordinances people love real
[1:39:03] books
[1:39:04] it's not sometimes people get so fixated
[1:39:08] on something and you realize why is
[1:39:10] somebody so fixated on this it's because
[1:39:12] when you really dig down deep you'll
[1:39:15] find out that's what's happening is
[1:39:17] they're basing they're basing an
[1:39:19] acceptance by God on an ability to do
[1:39:22] everything right
[1:39:25] so the it's human nature everybody wants
[1:39:28] to know just tell me what to do it's
[1:39:29] like give me all the rules and if I keep
[1:39:31] all the rules I'm fine that's what I
[1:39:34] want to know and it's not about keeping
[1:39:36] all the rules it's about believing God
[1:39:38] it's about accepting him in this day and
[1:39:40] letting his nature become part of your
[1:39:42] nature and fulfilling the law not by a
[1:39:45] book of ordinances but by the law of
[1:39:47] love amen by the very nature of Christ
[1:39:50] on the inside
[1:39:51] bringing us back into fellowship with
[1:39:54] God who is love you can't get back to
[1:39:56] fellowship with God Amen by by keeping
[1:39:58] ordinances because you can keep
[1:40:00] ordinances without faith
[1:40:03] and without faith it's impossible to
[1:40:04] please God you can say no the women do
[1:40:07] not cut their hair you wear this kind of
[1:40:08] clothing you come to church every time
[1:40:10] the doors are open you you read so much
[1:40:12] a day you pray so much a day you do all
[1:40:14] of these things and you'll be accepted
[1:40:16] by God none of those things equal
[1:40:18] acceptance by God what equals acceptance
[1:40:20] by God is faith in God who is the word
[1:40:23] who is the person of love
[1:40:28] so you can see the tendency is always to
[1:40:30] the law
[1:40:32] that's human nature but God didn't want
[1:40:35] God didn't initially establish a church
[1:40:38] he didn't initially establish rules he
[1:40:41] had one rule don't touch that tree and
[1:40:43] fellowship with me
[1:40:46] and God has brought us back into
[1:40:48] fellowship with him by what by the
[1:40:51] revelation of the word by the revelation
[1:40:53] of Jesus Christ God has revealed the
[1:40:55] mystery that was in the back part of his
[1:40:57] mind and that mystery was that the heart
[1:41:00] purpose of God the Eternal purpose of
[1:41:02] God was to have a bride of his own
[1:41:04] choosing
[1:41:05] because he wanted more than servants
[1:41:09] he wanted Fellowship
[1:41:12] I did not marry my wife so she could
[1:41:14] wash my clothes
[1:41:17] I could pay somebody to wash my clothes
[1:41:20] I didn't marry my wife to keep a house
[1:41:22] or to help me raise children I married
[1:41:24] my wife for Fellowship
[1:41:26] for companionship for love
[1:41:29] God is Not Looking for servants
[1:41:33] he's looking for a bride
[1:41:36] he's not looking for uh minions to do
[1:41:40] all of his bidding he's looking for a
[1:41:42] bride who will love him for who he is
[1:41:45] who will understand him will catch the
[1:41:47] revelation of the mystery and come into
[1:41:49] Union with him and give him the
[1:41:50] fellowship that he loves
[1:41:52] that's what he's doing that's what this
[1:41:54] day is all about that's what the message
[1:41:56] is about that's what the mystery being
[1:41:57] revealed is about to bring us back into
[1:42:00] this Union with God Amen to bring us out
[1:42:02] of religion bring us out of
[1:42:04] denominationalism bring us beyond the
[1:42:06] ordinances in the Creeds and bring us
[1:42:07] beyond all of that and bring us back to
[1:42:10] a revelation of God as the Creator who
[1:42:12] loves me and I love him back
[1:42:17] not now
[1:42:19] I never married my wife
[1:42:21] to do the dishes to clean the house to
[1:42:24] help me
[1:42:26] but because she loves me she does all of
[1:42:29] those things anyways
[1:42:31] and she serves me
[1:42:33] but she is not my servant
[1:42:39] she serves me Faithfully
[1:42:42] and listen she serves me Faithfully with
[1:42:45] no pay
[1:42:48] there's no paycheck there's no salary
[1:42:50] there's no benefits
[1:42:53] the only bond is love
[1:42:57] we didn't sign a contract you do so much
[1:42:59] you get so much
[1:43:02] it's all based on love and you can never
[1:43:05] find a more faithful servant than my
[1:43:07] life
[1:43:08] but it is not on a contract basis
[1:43:12] it's not on a rule basis it's not on
[1:43:14] instruction the whole the whole basis of
[1:43:18] the relationship is love and she serves
[1:43:20] me but she is not my servant
[1:43:23] and the Bride of Jesus Christ serves
[1:43:26] Christ with her whole heart and is
[1:43:28] obedient to everything that God wants
[1:43:31] not as servants not under a contract
[1:43:33] basis not to get acceptance but by the
[1:43:36] law of love amen
[1:43:38] it the the Daniel says the Ancient of
[1:43:41] Days did
[1:43:47] ministered unto him and brother
[1:43:49] Birmingham said who ministers unto the
[1:43:51] unto the uh King but the queen who
[1:43:54] ministers unto the bridegroom but the
[1:43:55] bride he said this is the bride and she
[1:43:58] ministers to the king she serves the
[1:44:01] king but she is not his servant
[1:44:04] Israel was their servant because they
[1:44:06] took a law in a rule book an ordinances
[1:44:08] to please God they became servants the
[1:44:10] bride's not his servant but the bride
[1:44:12] serves him
[1:44:14] it's our pleasure to serve him
[1:44:16] but it's the law of love
[1:44:21] we don't serve him for acceptance
[1:44:24] we don't serve him because of fear of
[1:44:26] refusal
[1:44:28] em we love him because he first loved us
[1:44:31] and when he revealed the great mystery
[1:44:33] in his mind he revealed how much he
[1:44:34] loved us
[1:44:36] and in turn it it brought a response a
[1:44:40] reciprocating love for him
[1:44:42] and this love brings us Beyond so many
[1:44:46] orders
[1:44:49] let's look at John 15.
[1:45:03] John chapter 15.
[1:45:10] in verse 13.
[1:45:14] greater love hath no man than this that
[1:45:17] a man laid down his life for his friends
[1:45:19] ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I
[1:45:22] command you henceforth I call you not
[1:45:25] servants for the servant knoweth not
[1:45:27] what his Lord doeth but I have called
[1:45:29] you friends for all things that I have
[1:45:31] heard of my father I have made known
[1:45:33] unto you
[1:45:35] Jesus speaking to his disciples and say
[1:45:37] I henceforth call you no more servants
[1:45:40] what changed them from servants to
[1:45:42] friends
[1:45:44] revelation
[1:45:46] read it again
[1:45:48] henceforth I call you not servants for
[1:45:50] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[1:45:52] doeth
[1:45:53] the servant just obeys but he doesn't
[1:45:56] know the mind of the master
[1:45:59] he doesn't know all things that his
[1:46:00] master does the servant just keeps the
[1:46:03] ordinance the servant just keeps the
[1:46:05] rule and the servant finds acceptance by
[1:46:08] obedience
[1:46:10] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[1:46:12] doeth but I have called you friends for
[1:46:15] all things that I have heard of my
[1:46:16] father I have made known unto you what
[1:46:18] changed the relationship from servant to
[1:46:20] friends because the friend is revealing
[1:46:23] himself to a friend and he says because
[1:46:26] I have revealed to you everything that
[1:46:27] I've heard of my father I won't call you
[1:46:29] servants anymore but I'll call you
[1:46:31] friends because now we're in Intimate
[1:46:33] relationship by revelation
[1:46:35] and if he could look at his disciples
[1:46:37] and say I call you no more servants but
[1:46:39] now I call you friends amen what would
[1:46:42] he say to his bride at the end time when
[1:46:44] he is given he's opened the book and
[1:46:46] loosed to seals and revealed the secret
[1:46:48] that was in the back part of his mind
[1:46:50] amen She's Come Beyond friendship into
[1:46:53] marriage
[1:46:55] praise God
[1:47:00] let's look at
[1:47:02] second second Corinthians 11.
[1:47:08] second Corinthians 11.
[1:47:13] and verse 2.
[1:47:23] second Corinthians 11 and 2 for I am
[1:47:26] jealous over you with Godly jealousy for
[1:47:28] I have espoused you to one husband that
[1:47:30] I may present you as a chaste virgin to
[1:47:33] Christ
[1:47:33] but I Fearless by any means as the
[1:47:35] servant be God Eve through septility so
[1:47:37] your mind should be corrupted from the
[1:47:39] Simplicity that is in Christ
[1:47:41] God had taken him from servants to to
[1:47:45] friends
[1:47:46] and Paul is wanting to espouse them into
[1:47:49] Christ Paul is trying to bring them into
[1:47:52] a marriage
[1:47:54] because the relationship is growing
[1:47:56] closer and closer
[1:48:00] and brother Branham says in the message
[1:48:02] titled love from 1956 that I think love
[1:48:05] is the greatest Force there is in the
[1:48:07] world
[1:48:07] there's nothing more powerful than love
[1:48:09] if I had the choice tonight and was a
[1:48:11] sinner and was standing here before God
[1:48:13] and he said now boy I'm going to give
[1:48:15] you all nine spiritual gifts I'm going
[1:48:17] to let you prophesy give you the spirit
[1:48:19] of Prophecy I'm going to make you a
[1:48:21] mighty preacher give you the word of
[1:48:23] wisdom and understanding I'm going to
[1:48:25] give you the gift to speak in tongues
[1:48:26] and to interpret I'm going to give you a
[1:48:28] gift of healing that you'll have a great
[1:48:30] faith for the sick and I'm going to do
[1:48:32] all these things for you I'll give you
[1:48:34] all that or I won't let you have any of
[1:48:36] those things but I'll let you have real
[1:48:38] love in your heart
[1:48:39] I say God give me love that's right for
[1:48:43] where there is tongues they shall cease
[1:48:44] where there's prophecies that will fail
[1:48:46] where there's knowledge it will vanish
[1:48:48] but where there is love it will endure
[1:48:50] forever that's what drove the heart of
[1:48:53] God to send Christ to the Earth
[1:48:56] it was what was his love
[1:48:59] we had an option for any gift in the
[1:49:01] world and we could become so popular or
[1:49:04] so powerful by all these gifts brother
[1:49:06] Branham said he would refuse them all
[1:49:07] and take love because God is love
[1:49:14] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:49:16] Prophet says but God's great mystery
[1:49:18] what the Eternal God had as a mystery
[1:49:20] has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ
[1:49:23] and given right down to his church
[1:49:26] what was once in God's mind is now on
[1:49:28] the body of Christ Jesus making love to
[1:49:31] the church his bride Whispering secrets
[1:49:34] to her
[1:49:36] how is Christ making love to his bride
[1:49:38] how's he expressing his love to her by
[1:49:40] Whispering secrets to her what Secrets
[1:49:43] the secret that was hidden under the
[1:49:45] seals
[1:49:46] The Secret of his great plan the secret
[1:49:49] of his threefold purpose
[1:49:52] his secret was that he would get back to
[1:49:55] Union with man again and go back to the
[1:49:58] fellowship they had in the Garden of
[1:50:00] Eden that's his great secret and how is
[1:50:03] he expressing Love To Us by Whispering
[1:50:06] that secret to us
[1:50:08] the Revelation that he gave to disciples
[1:50:10] moved him from servants to friends now
[1:50:13] the Revelation that was in the back part
[1:50:15] of his mind is the love secrets that
[1:50:17] he's making love to his bride with and
[1:50:19] drawing her to his side
[1:50:23] in the Feast of trumpets
[1:50:26] he says how can two walk together lest
[1:50:28] they be agreed
[1:50:30] Jesus was walking with his children in
[1:50:33] the Garden of Eden
[1:50:34] but then they broke the word
[1:50:37] but then Enoch come to a revelation of
[1:50:39] the word and once again he was walking
[1:50:41] with God how can two walk together
[1:50:43] unless they be agreed if Enoch's
[1:50:45] Revelation didn't agree with God God
[1:50:47] couldn't walk with Enoch
[1:50:49] but Enoch could walk with God because
[1:50:52] unless to be agreed how can they walk
[1:50:55] together
[1:50:56] so Enoch's Revelation was in agreement
[1:50:59] with God
[1:51:00] and they walked together
[1:51:03] how can two walk together lest they be
[1:51:05] agreed they can't Jesus said they can't
[1:51:07] and how can a church the Methodist and
[1:51:09] Baptists walk together how can the
[1:51:10] Church of Christ walk with the
[1:51:12] Presbyterians how can the Catholic walk
[1:51:13] with the Protestant how can the
[1:51:15] Protestant walk with Protestant
[1:51:17] but the bride can walk with the word
[1:51:19] which is Christ
[1:51:22] it must be an agreement not the
[1:51:24] ecclesiastical system but the word you
[1:51:26] have to agree with the word to walk with
[1:51:29] the word
[1:51:30] and who is the person of the word Jesus
[1:51:33] Christ
[1:51:35] and who are we walking with in this day
[1:51:37] we're walking with the person of the
[1:51:39] word and how can two walk together
[1:51:41] unless they be agreed it's the
[1:51:43] revelation of the word that we received
[1:51:45] that bring us back in contact with
[1:51:47] Christ
[1:51:48] and once again man can walk with God by
[1:51:52] walking with the word
[1:51:55] there has to be an agreement between you
[1:51:57] and the word the word in you and the
[1:52:01] word the person of the word and the word
[1:52:03] dwelling in you has got to come in
[1:52:06] harmony by the Revelation and once again
[1:52:08] man is walking with
[1:52:12] in
[1:52:13] his people amen coming back to Union
[1:52:17] back to fellowship
[1:52:19] look at Zechariah 14 I want to read just
[1:52:21] two scriptures and we'll close
[1:52:32] Zechariah 14.
[1:52:35] and verse 6.
[1:52:42] and now shall come to pass in that day
[1:52:44] that the light shall not be clear nor
[1:52:47] dark
[1:52:48] but it should be one day which shall be
[1:52:50] known to the Lord not day nor night but
[1:52:52] I shall come to pass
[1:52:53] that at evening time it shall be light
[1:52:57] we all know the scripture because
[1:52:59] brother Brandon preached it so well that
[1:53:01] there shall be light in the evening time
[1:53:02] this is the evening time and this is the
[1:53:05] light that has come
[1:53:07] behold the light has come
[1:53:11] and the light is the revelation of Jesus
[1:53:13] Christ that's bringing us back into that
[1:53:16] Fellowship let's go to first John
[1:53:25] first John
[1:53:29] 1 and 7.
[1:53:35] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:53:38] the light
[1:53:38] we have Fellowship one with another in
[1:53:40] the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[1:53:42] cleanses us from all sin
[1:53:45] where is he in the light
[1:53:49] we have to walk in the light as he is in
[1:53:51] the light but in the evening time it
[1:53:53] shall be light again
[1:53:55] it's light again friends
[1:53:57] he's here and we can walk in the light
[1:54:00] as he is in the light if he's in the
[1:54:02] light and we walk in the light we're
[1:54:04] once again walking with him
[1:54:07] come back into Union come back into
[1:54:09] fellowship and now I mean the prophet of
[1:54:12] God didn't come to bring us a church
[1:54:13] order he didn't come to bring us a rule
[1:54:15] book he came to bring a revelation that
[1:54:17] you would Knight the two back together
[1:54:19] and now we are not his servants but we
[1:54:22] serve him Faithfully now everything I
[1:54:24] know he wants it's my pleasure to give I
[1:54:27] my desire is to be pleasing to him but I
[1:54:30] can't be pleasing without a revelation
[1:54:31] without faith I can't just be copying my
[1:54:35] neighbor's works
[1:54:36] it can't just be I don't cut my hair I
[1:54:40] don't smoke or drink I I go to church I
[1:54:42] I confess I believe the message it's got
[1:54:45] to be more than that it's got to be a
[1:54:47] genuine Revelation that has brought you
[1:54:48] into Union with the person of the word
[1:54:51] and then the love of God is shed abroad
[1:54:54] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost and now
[1:54:56] it's not I'm it's not compulsory for me
[1:54:59] to keep the message it's not a mandate
[1:55:01] for me to keep the message I can go to
[1:55:03] the bank of the river and fish every day
[1:55:05] of my life and be just as safe but
[1:55:07] there's nothing in me that wants to do
[1:55:08] that what I want to do is serve him who
[1:55:10] loved me so much I want to love him back
[1:55:12] and if he says this is the way that's
[1:55:14] pleasing to me everything in me by
[1:55:17] revelation of who I am and who he is and
[1:55:19] what he's done for me has brought a
[1:55:21] desire into me to serve him and to
[1:55:23] minister unto him with everything that's
[1:55:25] in me and it's not compulsory
[1:55:28] it's not because I have to to make it to
[1:55:31] Heaven it's not I I I by Revelation I've
[1:55:35] received a revelation that I am a
[1:55:36] sieging of God my name was on the book
[1:55:38] before the foundation of the world it
[1:55:40] was laying on the marriage certificate
[1:55:42] under those seals since before the
[1:55:44] foundation of the world that I can no
[1:55:45] more be lost and God can be lost I'm not
[1:55:48] worried about losing my salvation I'm
[1:55:50] not worried about being a Castaway I'm
[1:55:52] not worried about not making the Rapture
[1:55:54] what I'm worried about is giving to him
[1:55:56] my full service and my full heart and
[1:55:58] serving him because I love him
[1:56:01] because of what he's done for me
[1:56:04] not jumping through a hoop to make it
[1:56:06] somewhere I made it before the
[1:56:08] foundation of the world
[1:56:10] not trying to attain to something it was
[1:56:12] attained for me
[1:56:15] not trying to be good enough look good
[1:56:18] enough act good enough none of that is
[1:56:21] any motivation amen all of that I would
[1:56:23] say is the wrong motivation
[1:56:26] and if that is any motivation left in us
[1:56:29] at all to look good at good attain to
[1:56:32] something be something to climb some
[1:56:33] ladder to get into good graces with God
[1:56:35] we need to go back to God and say God I
[1:56:38] need a revelation from you I need that
[1:56:40] understanding that I know beyond a
[1:56:43] shadow of a doubt that I was part of you
[1:56:45] before the foundation of the world I'm
[1:56:46] one of those C Gene attributes it's
[1:56:48] impossible for me to be cast away
[1:56:50] because I don't want to serve you out of
[1:56:52] fear I don't want to serve you
[1:56:54] compulsory because I have to I want to
[1:56:57] serve you out of love
[1:57:01] I want to be a faithful bride
[1:57:04] I want to be one of those thousands
[1:57:06] times thousands that come to minister
[1:57:08] unto you
[1:57:10] I I want to give you my whole life
[1:57:12] because I want to give you my whole life
[1:57:16] I want to give you my thoughts my
[1:57:18] desires my time my attention I want to
[1:57:21] give you that not to earn something but
[1:57:23] I want to give it to you because I want
[1:57:25] to give it to you
[1:57:28] not because somebody makes me feel
[1:57:30] guilty or ashamed
[1:57:32] not because somebody preaches fear into
[1:57:35] me and makes me feel like if I'm not
[1:57:37] good enough I better get good enough and
[1:57:38] if I'm not doing right I better do right
[1:57:40] amen not not any of that I want to be a
[1:57:43] motivation for me
[1:57:45] but I want to see how beautiful he is
[1:57:49] and how much he loved me
[1:57:52] and I want the love of God not a human
[1:57:55] love I want the love of God to be shed
[1:57:58] abroad in My Heart by the Holy Ghost
[1:58:01] so that I can love him with all my heart
[1:58:03] with all my soul with all my might with
[1:58:05] all my strength and I can love my
[1:58:07] neighbor as myself and I in doing so can
[1:58:11] keep the whole law
[1:58:14] not by reading a checklist and checking
[1:58:18] but by his life shed abroad in my heart
[1:58:23] and that I become a love slave to him
[1:58:30] uh Paul was a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:58:34] and he was bound by chains of love God
[1:58:38] didn't change him
[1:58:39] Paul chained himself to Christ
[1:58:42] what was the bonds that held him so
[1:58:44] tight it wasn't because it was
[1:58:46] compulsory amen it was because Paul
[1:58:48] loved Christ
[1:58:50] and it was the strongest bond there was
[1:58:55] the bond
[1:58:57] the bond that's the strongest is the
[1:59:01] bond of love
[1:59:03] not because we have to
[1:59:05] but because we want to
[1:59:08] and it's not like somebody can make me
[1:59:10] afraid
[1:59:12] you know you're not doing this you're
[1:59:13] not lining up here you need to line up
[1:59:15] here here and here
[1:59:17] listen everything in me wants to line to
[1:59:20] the word
[1:59:22] and if I find that there's some place in
[1:59:24] me not I want to repent and I want to
[1:59:26] lie to that word because I love him
[1:59:30] because I want to serve him and I want
[1:59:32] to please him and I by faith know who he
[1:59:35] is and I by faith know who I am and it
[1:59:37] motivates me to be pleasing to him
[1:59:41] but
[1:59:44] I don't want to be pushed
[1:59:47] coerced
[1:59:48] threatened
[1:59:51] I want somebody to preach the great
[1:59:53] Revelation and love of God
[1:59:55] I want somebody to preach the great
[1:59:57] threefold purpose of God because that's
[1:59:59] what unlocks the mystery
[2:00:02] somebody to preach the real message at
[2:00:04] the end time what is the message the
[2:00:06] message is that God's heart purpose
[2:00:09] the Eternal purpose of God was to have a
[2:00:12] bride of his own choosing
[2:00:15] and he has worked all of this time to
[2:00:18] bring back his plan and unfold it until
[2:00:21] he can get to a place where he has a
[2:00:23] bride Amen in that bride under the
[2:00:25] revelation of the word can be broken out
[2:00:27] of denominationalism can be broken out
[2:00:29] of religion and broken free from all of
[2:00:31] those holes that hold her back and the
[2:00:33] Holy Ghost can be freed from all the
[2:00:35] chains of denominationalism and the two
[2:00:37] can come back together as one that's
[2:00:39] what this message came to do
[2:00:42] and you'll never get there by rule
[2:00:44] keeping
[2:00:46] you'll only get there by the revelation
[2:00:48] of who he is and who you are in him
[2:00:53] and if you ever come to that place
[2:00:57] then nobody has to force you into
[2:01:00] anything
[2:01:02] if you ever come to that place nobody
[2:01:04] has to threaten you nobody has to make
[2:01:07] you feel ashamed or guilty all they have
[2:01:10] to do is show you the word and if you've
[2:01:11] come to that place you'll come to the
[2:01:13] word
[2:01:14] because the word is your mate the word
[2:01:16] is your bridegroom the word is the love
[2:01:18] of your life
[2:01:19] and we will always line to the word it's
[2:01:22] not that we get everything right it's
[2:01:23] not that we know everything yet there's
[2:01:26] many times as we mature and we grow and
[2:01:28] we understand more and we begin to
[2:01:30] understand that what I was doing wasn't
[2:01:32] pleasing the Lord this is what the
[2:01:33] prophet thought this is his desire and
[2:01:35] everything in us gravitates and moves to
[2:01:37] the word of God Amen we haven't arrived
[2:01:39] we haven't attained we're constantly
[2:01:41] moving to be more pleasing to him by
[2:01:43] love it's not like nobody ever has to
[2:01:45] tell us anything again it's not like
[2:01:47] we'll never be corrected for the pulpit
[2:01:49] again but not threatened amen not not
[2:01:51] not made ashamed in the Conformity but
[2:01:54] somebody will just show you this is what
[2:01:56] God likes and all of those have been
[2:01:58] United to Christ will say if that's what
[2:02:00] he likes that's what I like to do
[2:02:02] if that's what he wants that's what I
[2:02:04] want to because I have a great desire I
[2:02:08] want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[2:02:10] and I want to be Shackled by chains of
[2:02:12] love
[2:02:14] not by force not by peer pressure not by
[2:02:18] group conformity
[2:02:20] but by love
[2:02:22] it's the only thing that'll hold
[2:02:23] everything else will fade away
[2:02:26] everything else will fall subservient to
[2:02:30] the power of love
[2:02:31] and that's what I want to be my
[2:02:34] motivation that's what is my motivation
[2:02:37] and that's the way I want to preach the
[2:02:39] message
[2:02:40] that's my greatest desire it's not that
[2:02:42] we won't ever hold the word up again and
[2:02:44] say this is the word this is the
[2:02:45] standard this is God's desire it's not
[2:02:47] there'll never be another correction
[2:02:49] there'll be loads of Correction because
[2:02:51] we've not yet attained
[2:02:53] to everything we're looking for
[2:02:55] but oh God help us to move by revelation
[2:02:59] oh God help us to love you because you
[2:03:03] first loved us
[2:03:05] and help us God to Shackle ourselves to
[2:03:09] you
[2:03:10] by chains of love
[2:03:13] that's what he had in Eden that's what
[2:03:16] he once again
[2:03:17] not looking for servants
[2:03:20] but looking for a bride
[2:03:22] looking for a wife those that will
[2:03:24] minister to him and loving
[2:03:28] I say that'd be the greatest privilege
[2:03:30] of my life
[2:03:31] to be that to my Lord
[2:03:33] to serve him with everything that's in
[2:03:35] me not as a servant but as a wife but
[2:03:37] more faithful than any servant would
[2:03:39] ever be
[2:03:41] because of love
[2:03:43] man let's all stand
[2:03:49] God is wonderful
[2:03:54] and I love him with all of my heart
[2:03:57] he's done so much for me musicians if
[2:04:00] you'll come
[2:04:02] if we think about the great Revelation
[2:04:04] that's gone forth in this day it's
[2:04:06] overwhelming friends
[2:04:08] it's overwhelming the thoughts that he
[2:04:10] had of you before the foundation of the
[2:04:12] world the desire that he had to you to
[2:04:15] be United with you in the desire that
[2:04:16] motivated and moved him to topple
[2:04:19] governments to change the course of
[2:04:20] history to move things on a global scale
[2:04:22] why it was his desire to you that has
[2:04:25] moved him all down through time
[2:04:27] it is desire for you that has hunted you
[2:04:29] out wherever you were in the world and
[2:04:31] brought the Revelation to you it was God
[2:04:33] hunting you out like he hunted out
[2:04:35] Abraham like he hunted out everyone else
[2:04:37] and God brought the Revelation to you
[2:04:39] and placed a seed within you to be able
[2:04:42] to receive that revelation
[2:04:44] oh what gratitude are in our hearts for
[2:04:47] a God that loves us that much
[2:04:49] let the love of God be shed abroad in
[2:04:52] our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[2:04:54] and let that love for him and love for
[2:04:57] our neighbor be the Fulfillment of all
[2:05:00] the law
[2:05:01] and let's bow our heads and pray
[2:05:05] Lord Jesus I love you so much
[2:05:08] I thank you Father for your goodness
[2:05:10] Lord
[2:05:11] God you have been so good to us
[2:05:14] you have loved us with an everlasting
[2:05:17] love
[2:05:17] you've looked down through time and
[2:05:19] watched over us bringing us through Lord
[2:05:22] the generations watched over
[2:05:25] grandparents and parents and all of
[2:05:28] these things that bring us to the place
[2:05:29] we are God you're so good your mercy is
[2:05:33] Grace is so overwhelming to us
[2:05:37] God it makes us love you more
[2:05:40] I pray God that you would forgive us
[2:05:42] Lord for every wrong notion and wrong
[2:05:44] idea
[2:05:46] help us God to break away from the
[2:05:49] traditional thinking of humanity
[2:05:52] help us to move away from religious
[2:05:54] ideas and Concepts
[2:05:56] and help us God to come back to what you
[2:05:58] desire
[2:05:59] to be pleasing to you by Revelation in
[2:06:02] your word
[2:06:04] God help us Lord to surrender more than
[2:06:07] we've ever surrendered before and give
[2:06:10] you first place like never before
[2:06:13] for that's our desire gone

[2:06:25] opened every channel
[2:06:26] and you've invited us to walk into this
[2:06:29] tremendous revelation
[2:06:32] and God we do so with joy knowing that
[2:06:35] you've accepted Us in the Beloved
[2:06:38] that you paid the price of redemption
[2:06:40] that you paid it in your mind before the
[2:06:42] foundation of the world and you brought
[2:06:44] us to this realization because you want
