========================================

i know that jesus is the same today the prophet the bride must have it the on display come for christ in us to be completely glorified is is you may be seated [Music] and revelation only [Music] [Applause] because [Applause] [Music] the bride is receiving new revelations we're able to read between the lines and now the enemy is using all of his weapons to discourage deceive and destroy but only through his attempts he's caused the shack to stand out and to pull away from [Music] [Applause] i can only eat the bleeding my wings have felt the winds of faith and revelation only clears my view i can't return to what i've been and you can't persuade me otherwise because i've recognized that i'm an ego [Music] the bride has been taught by the to eleazar for more revelation truths are unfolding and daily we're growing we cannot stand on our intellect the squeeze is tightening in ways we never thought but all the while the bride's rejoicing i'm seeing more than i'm an ego i can only eat the bleeding word my wings [Music] [Applause] and you can't persuade me otherwise because i've recognized that i'm an ego spirits of old are deceiving causing many to reject christ within his bride yet the life is manifesting and she won't turn back her identity lies [Music] [Music] and you can't persuade me otherwise because i've recognized that i'm an ego i've recognized [Music] [Applause] you can fly in a higher place let's sing it again let's all stands [Music] oh [Music] we praise you hallelujah lord jesus [Music] higher see it again [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey right i am [Music] hi [Music] his brother aaron comes what afraid we have in jesus [Music] hallelujah god i am [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah oh our gracious heavenly father lord we worship you in spirit and in truth and lord we're humbled in your presence lord we sense that you desire to speak to us lord we know that we are not just gathering as the pastors already said traditionally lord we're not merely doing it because we believe it's an obligation to avoid hell but lord something in our hearts draws us to this place knowing that you've promised to speak to us in your word knowing lord that as we as we worship and lift our hands and praise that you come inhabit those praises and that you merely do not inhabit them that we might feel good but lord you're creating within us an expectation that you're here to speak to us and lord as we have done our part in laying aside the things of the of the flesh and the demands upon our time and look to you under expectation and have worshiped you and lifted your name and praise come now lord and take this bread and break it and feed it to us lord i believe myself personally as i look at this word and see it as maybe one sermon you can take it and divide it in such a way to feed five thousand lord divided in such a way that there's even leftovers lord there's more for those who would come later and maybe listen to it so father i pray that you would come now take the words which we read from your scripture and bless them take the burden which you've laid upon my heart lord and may you faithfully deliver it to your children that they may receive it and be benefited by it we ask these things in the lord jesus christ amen while you're standing i'd like to turn to the book of revelation revelation chapter 10 and i'm going to be reading verses 8 to 11 revelations chapter 10 verses 8 to 11. we're very happy to be here together with you and glad to be able to bring my family with me and to be in fellowship we considered a great privilege and an honor to see you and to be in fellowship with you and glad to have maybe a little bit more time together with you today with there being an afternoon service and a communion together maybe we'll have a chance to shake your hands and greet greet some of you we're very very happy to be here we bring greetings to you from hickory bible tabernacle and no the church i'm going to didn't change their name but since the last time i was here i moved and so we're living now in newton north carolina and attending hickory bible tabernacle and they send their love and greetings to you and pastor brother barry coffey sends his greetings to you and especially to brother chad and sister angie so love and greetings from north carolina i'm officially in the south so you pray for me revelations chapter 10 verses 8 to 11 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen you may be seated i'll give you my title here at the beginning the title is bittersweet and drawing that from the scripture where and it says that it was sweet in his mouth and bitter in his belly and so our title is bittersweet and i would maybe ask you now and perhaps i could remind you as we continue to just stay close with me today as i go through this subject it's one that i haven't had the privilege of ministering before and so something that's very heavy upon my heart i'm grateful for the opportunity to deliver it this morning to you but just stay with me as it may seem somewhat of a journey and as we go through certain principles in the scripture and laying the different foundations uh from the message of the hour um my my inspiration is on this this term bittersweet and uh we're just gonna kind of take a journey to arrive to how the lord has dealt with me on what that means for us but let's just start by looking at verse 11 revelations chapter 10 verse 11. and i'm going to just be laying some principles that are very familiar to us and um when we do so it can just be an exercise in saying amen and uh in agreeing and pulling on the word of god and saying sick them to the preacher like we believe that we lay that principle down and then we can kind of get into a momentum of where we're wanting to go and it says in verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and so this is spoken to john and we understand that john here is representative of the bride and that this speaks to the elect in the end time who are to prophesy again and speak the word of god utter to declare and utter the holy oracles of god to many peoples and nations tongues and kings and so this is a worldwide commission to the bride and it is to globally declare the divine revelation of christ so when we read this scripture we personally identify with john being told thou must prophesy again we recognize that this is prophetic of the bride being anointed to declare the word of god around the world to herself be the expression of the lord jesus christ around the world so we're looking at the bride's ministry this is the bride's ministry to prophesy again in revelations chapter 22 verse 17 it says and the spirit and the bride say come so you can see as the book of revelation is closed and as the entire bible is closing there's an announcement or there's a message that needs to be declared and it's not just the spirit saying it but it's the spirit and the bride because it's the spirit through the body of the bride that is saying come so it's not just the scripture saying and it's not the spirit speaking in the environment and hearing it but rather it's the spirit through the bride's body declaring and saying come and there's a number of statements that we could read a number of scriptures that we could read just to stay in that particular channel and i uh and i but i just want to refer to this very quickly and i just feel checked for a moment just to say i want i appreciate brother chad and sister angie and appreciate their friendship the friendship their family is to me and my children and if i didn't acknowledge you there in the beginning it's because i'm nervous and i always say and do something silly or don't say something that's rude uh and insensitive by not saying hello so i apologize for not saying thank you very much to brother chad for his friendship and for the invitation to be here together with you apologize for that and i'm sure there was no offense brother chad but that's just me making it right for not greeting the pastor it's because the last time i was here he didn't even come so i'm just just but i want to read a few statements he was out of town for those who are streaming he was he was out of town it did i just want to read a few statements from the church age book and this will kind of help uh just orient us to how this is uh firmly within the message he says in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age very familiar statement to us and there's many uh uh many times we have heard this and i believe that the emphasis should be not only on how we are the final voice to the final age but that we are only that voice under our messenger so we will never uh we will never even though we know progressive revelation is a concept within the message our revelation will never progress beyond the message so there's progressive revelation within the message but as revelation progresses in the bride it'll never go beyond what has been given the prophet has sown the entire seat of the bible he has brought us a complete and perfect message and so we will always be if we're to be a voice we will always be under our messenger and so this is a principle that's very important for us to understand we will be under our messenger and under our messenger we are the final voice to the final age and he makes the statement the voice of god will be in her and it's not that we have a prophet that is part of the bride but the voice of god is in her as a body he says this once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost and so he's wanting us to understand that there's a dynamic that takes place in the end time where the bride is speaking once again just as it did on the day of pentecost once more the world will hear direct from god as at the day of pentecost if you go and read in acts chapter 2 verses 4 to 11 and starting there in acts chapter 2 it tells us when the day of pentecost was fully come so it wasn't just an anointing or move of god that transpired in a in an isolated event but it was a prophecy coming to pass and there it came a time and a moment where god's word was going to be fulfilled so it wasn't that they gathered in the upper room and they fasted just long enough and they prayed just hard enough and they somehow something just clicked and it was time for the holy ghost to come but it was a time and a season of prophecy that when the day of pentecost had fully come now it was time for god to fulfill his word and there was a people there to receive it it says when the day of pentecost was fully come in galatians 4 4 it speaks of how when the fullness of time had come god sent forth his son well the fullness of time time wasn't over but it was the fullness of prophecy it's time for that prophecy to be fulfilled and brother brahman says just like it was on the day of pentecost once again the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost when this prophetic season comes to its fullness when it's time for the word to come forth and as you read that uh the instance there in acts chapter 2 it says they begin to speak after they were filled with the holy ghost they begin to utter and they begin to speak and it says that men out of every nation under heaven heard them speak and so there's a from devoutment from africa from asia from europe from every nation out of every nation under heaven they all heard the word and who did they hear it through the bride's body in their own language and those were the dynamics of the specifics of the dynamics that on that day here they are speaking in tongues but yet it's in a foreign language it's in a language that other people can hear and he's saying just as the world heard from god on the day of pentecost the world will hear direct from god as at the day of pentecost what is it it's a type of revelations 10 11 thou must prophesy before many peoples nations and tongues and what's happening god is declaring the word through a mini-membered body around the world with many different tongues and nations and every nation under heaven is hearing this word expressed in their own language because once again the world is hearing direct from god and so a many membered body is speaking at the when the fullness of time has come for her to speak and the fullness is coming for her to declare the word he says but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age so she's going to have this very dynamic global ministry but it's going to be rejected he says oh god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride the voice is in the bride so the bride is not without a voice she has a voice the voice is in the bride he says he's he's repeating this over and over the voice of god will be in her she's the final voice to the final age the world's going to hear direct from god how through the bride and with all due respect it's not just pushing play but those who are pushing play are able to speak and declare the holy oracles of god because the voice is in the bride and so that we and i believe he gets to this very specific language so that we can understand it's not a single ministry god's not raising up one man to be our mouthpiece and god is not raising up another messenger to declare the truth and explain to us what the message means and there's no type as mo aaron was given to moses so his have you been given to brother branham to explain everything that he had wanted to say no the bride has a direct connection to the message to listen to it and to hear it and god has gifted and sent ministers to take this word and speak it to us and declare it to us and be in harmony with the original message that was given but then all of us being partakers in this one bread we too are the voice of god in this last day he says in those elect so he's speaking to the individuals those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works so there are individuals who will be his body and will be his voice and perform his works it's the manifestation of christ in in the body in the body form of the bride right it's a manifestation of christ where there's a a body form who's speaking the word and performing his acts this is what the scripture's telling us this is what the message is telling us and so the bride is under commission according to revelations 10 11 to prophesy it is the ministry of jesus christ in bride form brother branham says in the message modern events made clear by prophecy when he begins to reveal himself into the seed form again the same one that went into the ground come back to be the bride and there's times when brother is referring to the church going into the ground and there's other times when he's referring to christ himself who went into the ground and here he's showing us that the bride is now a representation of that seed christ that went into the ground it's coming back to be a bride he says just the bride and the groom is the same flesh and blood the same ministry and the same things doing just exactly what he'd done and so brother branham is emphasizing to us it is the same flesh and blood the same ministry and the same things doing just exactly what he'd done so the bride has the same ministry of christ as christ now i don't want to make the mistake of trying to distinguish what was his ministry and what's our ministry i just believe that our ministry is his ministry and he makes the statement about it this this is just maybe a a fragment or just a phrase but he says manifesting in full measure the bride the same as the groom so the bride is the full manifestation she is a manifestation of the full measure and she's the same as the groom he makes the statement she is him now we understand that's a mouthful and it's a paradox but we believe it he says in the message proving his word when the word here unites with the person and they too become one then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing so revelations 10 11 the bride prophesying again to a peoples nations tongues and kings it is the ministry of the son of man in br in the bride body in bride form it is the ministry of jesus christ once again on earth god has returned back in human beings in physical form and the word has embodied itself in a people and what is being shown forth from her are the praises of god is the word of god and she's uttering the holy oracles of god and so once more the world is hearing direct from god he said well the world's not hearing his voice but they're hearing direct from god and it's from you has sounded out the word of the lord just as as paul wrote to the thessalonians and colossians and he wrote and he said i write to you in ink and paper but you having read my epistle and then lived the epistle you become my letter now in flesh he says so that i don't even have need to go to your place so i don't need to ride that trail again i don't need to come back and hold a meeting i don't need to be resurrected because you by taking my message and living it out you have declared it so i have no need to come back and do it that's just what the bible says and so we're showing here and just laying a foundation the bride's ministry and brother branham writes this in chapter 3 of the church age book when he's writing about the ephesians church age he says the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold that's pure deity wow these are brother brands words i almost wish i would have brought maybe the church age book and highlighted it we could have had the cameraman zoom in on it because somebody may think i'm reading from the catholic the catechism or something of the catholic church but he says the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her oh my she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god now any can anybody raise their hand and testify that this is in the church age book you've read it that i'm not taking this from from the pope brother branham wrote this about the bride so he says how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for god hath spoken it we believe this i believe this is true and as we read these things and even through these portions of the message and the scriptures we've referred to this is a a grand picture this is a very beautiful description of a ministry of a bride of a church and we begin to formulate in our minds this image of something very great and something very grand and in some ways we could say that the way brother branham is describing the bride is exactly the way the catholic church describes herself and how she's tried to represent herself around the world where their temples are very ornate and their churches are very uh adorned with gold and great amenities and everything is is very flashy to the eyes and very uh striking to the flesh and so as we think about this great ministry and we think about these wonderful things that are being said in our minds we can create a very grand and beautiful picture of the bride's ministry but there's something that must happen first before she can fully prophesy again there's a process that she must be engaged in there's something that's happening before she comes to this full manifestation and there's something that john did before he's told thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings there's something that must take place first now to use a legal phrase and i don't know where i would find something like that but to use a legal phrase a conditioned precedent and so in contract law and many different agreements there is a conditioned precedent so that something must happen first before another thing transpires it's an event which must take place before a party to a contract must perform or do their part and so a contractor and a landowner can agree for the contractor to build a barn but the contract can say the contractor will build the barn once the land owner furnishes the materials or furnishes the wood and so the contractor's not obligated to build the barn until the landowner has delivered the materials and so delivery the materials would be a conditioned precedent he had to do his part before the next part is done and so it is an event which has to occur before the title or another right of some sort to property will actually be conveyed and the party receives title so something has to happen before something is received another way of saying is a condition precedent is an event or condition a state of affairs required before something else can occur and the way that i'm wanting to make this relevant is there is a conditioned precedent here in revelations chapter 10. we know verse 11 the bride will prophesy again she will have a ministry she'll be the very manifestation of jesus christ but there's something that transpires and is transpiring before that fully occurs it's not we just read revelations 10 11 and say oh my we're going to we're going to prophesy again but we must be walking in the steps of the scripture it's not just whosoever calls upon the lord shall be saved but no how can one believe on him whom he has not heard and how can you hurt unless unless a man preach and how can a man preach unless he be sent so it's not just calling upon the name of the lord to be saved but it's god sending an ordained minister to preach jesus christ you hear jesus christ believe upon jesus christ and then call upon his name and those are the elements of salvation in believing in his name not just anybody who reads the scripture and says jesus is going to be saved but there's a process to it there's conditions precedent to it and so here's the condition proceeded to revelations 10 11 it's in verses 9 and 10. and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and see it's very bold of john to do this to say give me the little book but he was told to do it and he he had instinctive obedience to that message do it i'm going to do it go tell go to him who has the but go to the mighty angel and and and say give me this book and he says give me give me the little book he doesn't even say please just not may i please have the book he's just under this inspiration give me the little book and it's remarkable and i'm sure this has been ministered here before and perhaps i've even mentioned it myself this is one who in chapter five wasn't even worthy to even look at it let alone touch it i mean he wasn't allowed to look at it he couldn't even look sometimes you say look but don't touch this is don't look don't touch and yet now the one who wasn't worthy and no man was worthy to even look upon this book now all of a sudden a messenger tells him and is commissioned him to go and take it now something has happened what's happened he's heard the revelation of the seven thunders and that has now empowered him to be able to have a right to that book because he knows that that book is his and that book is him that he's a part of this and so he's now a commissioned told to take the book and the angel tells him to take it and eat it up and now who the one who is unworthy to look at it unworthy to touch it is now able to do that which would be the most intimate to actually take it and eat it it's very very dynamic things are transpiring and the angel says and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and it says and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up so i ate all of it didn't leave anything behind i ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey so he's he's it's exactly what the angel said it would be it's going to be sweet in your mouth and he says and as soon as i had eaten it so as he begins to take it into his mouth it's very sweet to him but he says as soon as i had eaten it now that i'm done chewing it now that it's no longer in my mouth as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and this is what i'm wanting to focus on this very passage of scripture here in revelations 10 10. he eats it it's sweet in his mouth but then after he's eaten it it's in his belly as a bitterness and the only way that the bride can prophesy again is she takes the book and eats it it's the only way we're going to be able to have a voice the only way that we have a message the only way that we're going to be able to walk in these very things that we've read already where brother brown says she's the uh she is likened to pure gold and she's summed up all the manifested eternal wisdom and purpose of god before any of this can truly be so we have to first take in the book and eaten the book the bride has been granted the privilege to take the book and eat it and i and this is this is as individuals we're given this privilege and corporately we're given this privilege but you must as an individual be taking this book and eating it it's something that you can't just say wow brother chad and brother kyle the different ministers here brother ben they're taking that word and they're and they're feeding out and they're preaching it and you're just hearing it no you must be taking the book yourself and you must be feeding on it and you must be eating it so it's something done corporately as a body of the christ around the world but it's something that we must do individually and just a few statements to identify the bride's feast in this end time in the message seed is not heir with the shock he says neither will a christian eat on that dead akarians from old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of god fresh the promise of the hour god promised rabbits in the day of luther he promised other things in the days of others but now there's been an evolution to the diet and that's what happens even as a child develops there's an evolution and diet there's been a change in diet that rabbits in the days of luther he says he promised other things in days of others i wish he would have told us what they had in wesley's day and what they had in pentecost days but it was rabbits in the days of luther but now we know what we have now now he's promised a full square meal the full seven course menu for all the seven seals are opened open all seven seals are open and everything is ready for the word of god and now he make this next statement is very important to those who can receive and that's why to some they're not open because they're not the some who can receive but to those who can receive there's a full square mill full seven course menu for all seven seals are open can you receive it amen we can receive it we have a seven course menu the all seven seals are open to us and we're feeding on this meal that has been opened up to us those seals are christ christ are the seals that are open he's the one that opened those seals and that's the menu that we're feeding on and the message rising of the sun as we heard the sister sing the song a genuine quickened eagle lives by that and he raised up christ from the grave dwelling in you as has quickened your mortal body unto his presence you can recognize it you're no longer a scavenger you're an eagle you don't want the things of the world you're a son and daughter of god you're feasting at a fountain that the world knows nothing about this is a secret feast it's a feast in the presence of your enemies has prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies he's prepared this seven course menu what has he done he's actually prepared a feast for you in the bride age while laodicea looks on [Applause] and in the presence of your enemies it's just out of reach they can't get to you but there you are feast and the very language of that scripture is remarkable he's prepared a table and i'm feasting in the presence of my enemies usually if you eat in front of an enemy you're eating in haste you're eating very quickly if you eat it all because you never know what one moment you may need to fight but now the bride is at such rest so hidden away in the secret of his tabernacle hid away in the secret of his presence and the secret of his pavilion from the strife of tongues and the pride of men that we can in the midst of trouble in the time of trouble with our enemies just right there in our presence we can feast at the king's table we can just rest why aren't you worried oh the king's giving me a meal why aren't you worried about what laodicea why aren't you worried about all these enemies gathering throw a hole should have camp against me oh not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident i'm sitting in the secret of his presence dining at the king's table feasting on a king's mill only fit for a queen [Applause] he said the world knows nothing about it you're drinking it the world knows nothing about you are eating hidden manna that the world never know nothing of it i like saying it just the way he said it never knowed nothing of it the world never knowed nothing of it for you are an eagle the world doesn't know about this feast full square meal full seven course menu all seven seals are open you're feasting on a fountain that the world knows nothing about you're eating hidden manna in the secret of his tabernacle he says an anointed one's at the end time the son of man is christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words were fell and brother branham said i'm a man my words will fail so he's making a distinction he even says in one place can you get it separated now so you have a son of man and the son of man we're not feeding on william branham we're feeding on the son of man christ he says but you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man that is what we're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man so it is a feast that we're we are engaged in it's a feast that we have been called to it's even there's it's so striking in scripture and in the message that we can see that in this time of a union this time of a wedding a united invisible union that the bride is feasting and so we're feasting now spiritually and then one day we're going to a wedding supper it's going to be a translation it's going to be a change of our body there's going to be a meeting in the air and there's going to be a wedding feast but right now we're feasting and if i could say this is i'm just building we're on a journey now and so at this point i i'm just wanting to walk together through things we understand things we know things that we believe but and so if we take this from the scripture out john took the book and ate it and he says i ate it up the bride's doing the same thing because he is those seals and we can see just the continuity with the message and the scripture and how brother branham brings this to us and in the mouth it's sweet as honey in the mouth that is it is enjoyable something to be desired something that's pleasing something that satisfies we could even make mention how that revelation to the believers stimulation is something that's pleasurable and as you take this message and you eat it and it and it's quicken to you and you have that privilege of hearing the voice the privilege of taking the word taking this unfailing body word of the son of man and you're eating there's a pleasure that you derive from the taste of it and then tasting it and it being quickened to you and you having the privilege of eating it and just think of the times when you're in a church service or you're reading your bible or you're listening to a message and now it stimulates you and it's exciting and you love it and it's enjoyable and you're like my this is fun and listen the world thinks you're crazy when you talk about how much you enjoy church and they're like and i enjoy church we got a great band we got a good light show and and the pastor he's just cool he preaches and flip-flops and and shorts and he's just down to earth man and today we're doing the avengers in the bible and and the bride you know she's the brides and the church is like an avenger and right the church has this superpower and that superpower and it's really neat it's seeing god in the movies is what we're doing and we really enjoyed church and you're going okay ours is totally different but i enjoy it even more than you enjoy what you got [Applause] i didn't go to the movies i went to church i didn't hear something from from a comic book i heard something from the word of god and i loved it and they say yeah our pastor just speaks for about 30 minutes and ours 30 30 times 4. [Music] and we love it and we enjoy it and we can do it hour after hour and we look forward to it listen some of you can fellowship on this when you're in the world and you really got drunk or you got you got high you did something you just got strung out one night and you really just got really intoxicated you wake up the next morning you're hungover and you feel off he said i never want to do that again but you never feel that way after church the presence of god moves you're feast on the word of god you're like that was wonderful that was great so there's a there's something enjoyable about that aspect but there's another part of the eating there's another part of this condition precedent first it is in the mouth but it must also be in the belly and if you've eaten it properly that's where it'll end up you've taken it properly it ends up in the belly and i just about tasting something and swishing it around and spitting it out or just kind of you know just a little taste a little smell maybe just a little bite just to get the flavor but when you've taken it and eaten it all and you're taking the substance what's been delivered to you what's been ordained to you what's been put on your plate and we're told our whole lives to eat finish your plate finish your plate finish your plate and then when you do that as an adult you're a hog or you're a pig or something i was told it from two years on to finish my plate now i'm getting looked and brothers are handing me a knife you know what the bible says put a knife to the gluttonous one i'm just doing what i've been told for my whole childhood but you got to take all of it and eat it eat it up because it's got to be in the belly ezekiel chapter 3 verses 1 to 3 and there's so much more that can be mined from this but i want to make very quick references to these things in verse 1 of ezekiel 3 and we'll read to verse 3 moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel can you see the the how the the continuity there and the same imagery of revelations chapter 10 now being expressed to ezekiel the son of man he takes the scroll he takes the role he eats it then he speaks the bride is taken this sealed book that's been opened to her and when she eats it she's speaking he says so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat the roll and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee don't just fill your mouth with it but eat enough to where it fills your belly and he says then did i eat and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness so now the son of man ezekiel's having a similar experience where he's taking the role and the scroll he's taking it he's eating as he eats it he's to fill his belly with it fill thy bowels with this roll that i give unto you she says as i it was in my mouth it was sweet as honey to hear the word is sweet the eating of the word the tasting of the word is enjoyable the bible even speaks of those who've tasted of the word of god and they enjoy that they think they've tasted they can enjoy just the little bits and pieces they can enjoy the moments they can enjoy what they've tasted and listening to the word of god is exciting the revelation of the word of lord is stimulated taste it is wonderful but it's got to be in the belly jeremiah chapter 15 verse 16 the words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart isn't that a beautiful scripture thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart thy words were found and i did eat them i was found of this message i was told to go take the book and i did eat them and thy words were under me a joy and a rejoice in my heart for i am called by thy name o lord of god of host lord god of host oh this is so beautiful to me because at the open of the seals you hear your name called [Applause] and even as it was said that to to the prophet you're going to go and anoint to say you're going to go anoint the new king he says and it'll be the one that i name and it was he didn't say david but he was identified he was brought forth a message called him out of the field he stood before the prophet and that was the naming of the king he was identified he was called forth and when this book was opened you were called forth you were named your name was called he says all thou has called me by my name and the word which was given to me i have eaten it it is a joy and a rejoicing of my heart can you identify yourself with jeremiah 15 16. why because eating the word is a rejoicing taste in the word is something that we enjoy that we love but the mouth isn't where the body receives the full benefit of what is eaten where you really get the what you need from what you're eating is in the digesting matthew chapter 15 verse 17 do not yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goethe into the belly and is cast out into the drought jesus is actually referring to the body's ability to process things that are impure and to get rid of things that are not good but also assimilate and digest and take in nurturance and pass it down to the body those things which are good saying that in the natural process whatever you eat it goes in the mouth goes into the belly and this is the process wherein we're good the bible speaks if it was in my mouth sweet as honey but in my belly it was bitter this is the body's process of function of processing food and getting the nutrients out of it so you don't taste the word in your belly and you don't get pleasure in the digestion process in the natural it's it's quite the opposite we experience a lot of discomfort after we've enjoyed the tasting right it was great in our mouths and it was wonderful my bed tasted good my that was rich mal it was great and then at one point you go oh i ate too much oh that wasn't good shouldn't have done that shouldn't ate that last piece why because once it's there you're not enjoying it like you did when it was in your mouth but once it's in the belly that's where you start to get the benefit that's where you're going to process the nutrients from it that's where you begin to administer nourishment to the body and the way the whole digestion process works from that moment as it begins to take be broke down the body is an incredible it's not a natural process but one designed by god to take things from the food and use it to nourish the entire body and the ability to digest certain foods and process certain foods and receive the full benefit of food is a mark of maturity because you just don't give solid food to a baby once it's born there's actually great care that's given to the raising of a child where there's certain things you know the stomach can't handle that kind of it can't handle that kind of sweetness yet it can't handle that kind of milk yet it can't handle there's certain things that the body hasn't matured enough to be able to break down and process uh within the digestive system oh it can be great in the mouth i can still remember the first time with elliot he's our firstborn and he's like wow he really loves this whipped cream wow he really really likes his mom mom mom and all of a sudden it got to the belly and i was like nope not ready for that quite yet why because it hadn't matured and grown to the point where it could process the things that are contained in there and even those sugars and it was too soon they even said don't give honey to a baby but it's three days why because there's a there's not time yet it hasn't evolved to the place where it can process those things in first corinthians chapter three verses one to three says and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ so they're babes in christ they're children of christ he's not taking away their experience but he's acknowledging that there hasn't been the proper growth for him to be able to speak to him in a certain way so you speak to people according to their experience in a way that will nourish them in their present state but in a way that will cause them to grow into the next level so if you're properly feeding your baby they'll grow to be able to handle more solid foods more solid foods to eventually they're not eating baby food anymore they're eating the same table food you are just in different portions and so he says i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able so this is quite a rebuke i've continued to give you milk as peter said his newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby and growing by the milk you'll be able to take on and feast on more parts of the word of god it says i fed you with milk i really want to feed you with meat but i'm not you're not able to bear it not even now are you able to bear it for verse 3 for your yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying in strife and divisions and you're not are you not carnal and walk as men so their carnality was uh was to the place where paul was acknowledging they would not be able to properly digest the real meat of the word but they had to mature they had to grow and he's there's there's making a a point and connecting the ability and the impact of the word how it takes a person out of carnality out of indiana strife and divisions and and brings them to a place where they're feeding on the kind of word which is a mark of maturity and as they are eating properly it's causing them too mature if you only stay in milk you're always going to be carnal it's always going to be strife and divisions but if you want to begin to go further this start eating more of the word of god and not just enjoin it in your mouth but making sure your bowels are full of it it says in hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 to 14. again i just want to remind you we're on a journey each one of these things we're just we're just passing by something and describing it to you as we pass by it just hoping that these different principles are building together to be a blessing to you and hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 to 14 he's speaking of melchizedek called of god a high priest after the order of the melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing your dole of hearing so paul was saying i want to tell you more about who this melchizedek is but i can't because you're dull of hearing so he had more to preach about melchizedek and brother branham comes and picks up and says who is this melchizedek i knew there was a bride that was going to raise up in the end time with the maturity to take that message and eat it so he says you are verse 12 for when for the time you ought to be teachers so they should have matured to the place where they could teach and this is a very important principle as we continue later the feeding on the word of god should bring you to a place to where not only are you able to learn but you're able to teach i've heard and now i'm speaking i've heard the word of god and now i'm declaring out i've heard these things i've received these things i've processed these things i've eaten these things now i can express and manifest these things he says you should be teachers but now you need to be taught again which be the first principles of the oracles of god in hebrews chapter 6 he says let us go on unto perfection that's the teleotaste let us go on to the perfect door the perfect one he says we'll do this if god permits why do you say that because it was a dispensation it was a time it was prophecy and i believe in this hour god has permitted we don't need to lay again the foundation the foundations have been laid we've come to the perfect perfect one he says and are become you ought to be teachers but now you need to be taught again and you've become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat it says but for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness so you're if you're only using milk then you haven't evolved to a greater skill in the word of righteousness for he is a babe now this is corrective but it's not destructive he's correcting them he's rebuking them but he's not completely destroying them saying they're not church they're not bribed they're not the right kind of materials you're saying you haven't matured you haven't grown it says but strong meat belonging to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so it's not just a tasting but it's a taking and processing and assimilating and filling your bowels with it and your body deriving from this message the things that you need that you can grow and mature to be able to take more things and you don't choke on it [Applause] so that when something real heavy is preaching i'll go let's go back to the milk no you've taken what you need from the milk you've taken what you need from a more solid food you're taking things for this message and you're taking it deep say lord this is a meal that's been given to me lord bless this food may it be nourishment to my spiritual body and then you chew it i think my grandma used to say chew it 40 times i chew every bite 40 times and i'd look at her one two three four because i don't think she chewed it 40 times she wanted me to chew mine 40 times break it down chew it up make sure your body can digest it don't just try to take it and swallow it whole something may happen you may choke on but take it think on it pray on it chew on it break it down as it begins to those enzymes begin to be released and it's going to come into your belly and your body's going to get what it needs from it and then you can begin to eat more and more and more and more [Applause] strong meat belongs to them they're full age those who have by reason of use the use of the milk the use of the meat the use of the food that's been given have had their senses exercised they've matured and grown and now they're to a place where they can discern both good and evil and i believe that's the bride's calling today we shall return and judge we must return and discern and know righteousness from wickedness to be able to know and it says you sit among the congregation of gods we should be able to know what evil is and what good is be able to judge and discern that's the season we're living in not a season where the bride is just love everybody we just want to love everybody but having eyes wide open know how to love listen brother brahma said if any one individual reasons against one punctuation of god's word if an individual reasons against the punctuation of god's word that's your enemy but then the bible says love your enemies as yourself and a lot of us know enough about the message to know who our enemies are but we haven't eaten it enough to know how to love them and because we've only tasted it and known that that's against the word then we know they're an enemy and when the carnal way we hate them and we speak evil and we run them down and in the whole process christ is not glorified it's one thing to discern but another thing to have the right attitude and so the condition proceeding is not just a sweet taste in the mouth but it's a bitterness in the belly we've come to this place and we've arrived at this point this is where i want to come to this thought of bittersweet it's sweet to eat this message but if you're eating it right it gets bitter in your belly bitter means harsh it's harsh or piercing that's what the meaning of bitter it was bitter it's harsh in my boat it was piercing in my belly the belly even speaks of the womb we understand that even in this hour of the bride has been impregnated by the word of god there's something that's taking place in this union where she's been impregnated with the word it's the harshest of piercing and the belly even speaks of the stomach so this piercing and this harshness follows the eating this there's something that is uh difficult painful uneasy uncomfortable just as sometimes we eat things in the natural and it makes us uncomfortable and we can feel it in the digestion say well i really enjoyed eating it but now as it's being digested it's there where you get the benefit not when it was in your mouth listen i don't believe we should have any spiritual eating disorders you take what's been given to you you eat it you let your body process it you get the fatness out of it you need revelations chapter five part two brother branham preaches this he says in this sevenful book and i'm reading this just to set in the context of the message how brother branham identifies this bitter belly he says in this sevenful book of the sevenfold book of seven redemption plans has been brought to us thank the lord and that's what this book holds he says now we're going to get over the 10th chapter where this mighty angel proclaims something and he had a little book that john had to eat and when he did he got it into his belly and it was bitter but in his lips it was sweet and as far as i've come across as the only place that brother branham amplifies this he says but in his lips it was sweet when you have to digest it then it gets bitter when you're eating it it's great it's wonderful even here when we eat on it it's great we're with family this is a family meal we're all friends here none of us are eating with a fork in one hand and a sword in the other put our swords down we're eating we're comfortable we're all fellowshipping together but he says when you begin to digest it if i could get ahead of myself when you begin to process it when you begin to apply it when you begin to assimilate it when you begin to express it when it begins to make a difference not when you're just saying amen to it but when you're applying it when you're living it when you're making the hard choices when you're sacrificing as a result of it because when you begin to digest it it gets bitter jesus shout amen here and agree with it but when you live it that's when it gets difficult he says everybody's against you everybody's telling you you're a holy roller and what that term's not really used anymore unless you're reading the message anybody been called a holy roller recently i mean when's the last time that's happened and he says you're this that or the other he says you're off your head this is what they're saying so it's it's not just you're a holy roller you're but it's you're this you're that this the other he says you're off your head he says so it's hard to digest it it's something that follows the eating something begins to take place in a person's life when they're really eating the book when they're really taking this message and assimilating and chewing it and digesting and feeling their bowels full of that role and they're causing the belly to eat then something else happens is it gets in the belly and it's bitter when you have to digest it then things turn against you so it's hard to digest it but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweet in your lips that's all and when you stand up in a meeting and say glory to god hallelujah he says that's when it's sweet when you're in a medium testament says oh when you're going through that great siege it's hard there's a siege there's a squeeze there's a pressing he says it's hard but then when you're out of that great seed you can testify of it then it's sweet in the lips he says that's this book of redemption this book of redemption is bittersweet it's a double-edged sword it's a bittersweet book that's this book of redemption and this i want to share this because i'm going to begin to go further in this journey and uh and focus on some maybe specific aspects of this bitterness but the bitter belly represents the pain and difficulty that comes in taking the word the painful side of eating all of the open book and we must eat the book as i've already mentioned before eating the book is enjoyable and the first first page of my notes as i had the different scriptures and quotes laid out that that part as we read about the bride being the the manifested eternal wisdom and purpose of god and liking the pure gold and her attributes are his attributes and it's the same flesh and blood the same ministry the full measure the pride the same as the group all those things are glorious to read it's glorious on paper but it never feels the same when it's in your flesh it's one thing when you read that it's going to be his body be his voice perform his works but when you do it's a lot different than what you thought it would be [Music] we must take the book and eat it and eating's enjoyable but we must experience the bitterness as well and if you're not experiencing bitterness perhaps you're not actually taking the book and eating it and the bitter belly is the hard part but it's just as necessary as the sweet part if we eat all of it it's gonna there's gonna be a bitterness but it's only after the belly is bitter that we can fully walk in revelations 10 11. he didn't say as i ate it and it was sweet in my mouth and while i had the sweetness in my mouth and i was still just there in a very sweet flavor and something very enjoyable it wasn't then that he said prophesy again but it was after it made his belly bitter he said thou must prophesy again so it wasn't the sweetness that qualified him to prophesy but it was a bitterness in his belly that followed the sweetness that made him qualified to prophesy in order to prophesy again and to be his voice we must have bitter bellies for the bride's ministry to be effective the bride has to have this bittersweet experience why it's a bittersweet mystery it's a bittersweet sweet ministry that follows the mystery it's a bittersweet experience for the bride and this is where i might seem to be getting very specific here but i just feel so directed to this channel bitterness is meant to produce a humility and a meekness if this message was only ever sweet we wouldn't be healthy if it was only always just the things we love to taste the things we love to we love to hear if it didn't have a difficult part if it didn't have a hard part if it didn't have a business we would never be healthy just tell your kids eat what you like see how healthy they turn out just eat what you well i like the desserts well that's fine just make sure you get enough calories we just need to have so many calories a day divide those up among the meals we eat and you can eat whatever you want where they find that it's just not calories there's bad calories and there's good calories and if you could take that type and begin to try to use it in a particular way to understand what i'm referring to here it's not just the sweet that we need it's the bitter we need in order to be healthy we've got to take the the hard part bitterness is meant to produce a humility and a meatness that is required to fully walk in our calling and to be able to manifest his power if it was only sweetness we could never accurately portray his power it was always just good if there's always a pleasure in the mouth we can never accurately portray christ because it wasn't always sweet to him and if we're going to be christ like we must also experience the bitterness of christ [Applause] bittersweet the very word bittersweet means pleasure accompanied by suffering it's a blessing with the consequence that's something that it's there's good side to it like a double each other there's good to it there's a bad a negative to it there's two sides and as john is told to take the book and eat it there's a sweetness to it but there's a bitterness to it it's bittersweet brother brown when he's preaching the seventh seal and i just want to use this as an example to you of what it means to be something bittersweet he says now when that gets on tape he's preaching the seventh seal when what he said gets on tape which it is that it's probably gonna send that it probably send ten thousand of my friends away from me are you talking about bittersweet the bitter it was gonna drive ten thousands of his friends away from him but then draw a bride to christ can we not testify to that yeah brother branham lost tens of thousands of friends but he brought a bride to christ i know when i do this there's going to be tens of thousands that leave me but i've got to make the introduction of the church to her bridegroom i've got it it's going to cause a lot of people to fall away but i've got to make the introduction this introduction was sweet but there was a bitter cost to it says they're going to say brother iran's trying to put himself make himself a servant or a prophet or something before god he says let me tell you my brethren that is an heir i'm only telling you what i've seen and what has been told to me now you do whatever you want to thank god for his faithfulness just tell us what he saw tell us what he was told told to say why because the mystery of revelations 10 when john is told to go to him and take the book the mystery is that there is a prophet that would be there to take that book and hand it to the bride to make the introduction that we could we could take this message and feed on jesus christ so bittersweet there's a sweet side in the bitter side there's a pleasure and there's a pain but this bitterness has a purpose second corinthians chapter 12 verses 7 to 9. i think we're just just moving along maybe right on schedule here listen the few that i come in contact with are all telling me preach as long as you want you can go three hours and i realize it's not a majority and we're not going to vote it's not going to be democratic but the virtually everyone i come in contact with wants me to preach long and since i come in contact with them i don't want to disappoint them i haven't seen you yet so the chance i could get away with it and i believe his brother chad who prayed may he just take his time be comfortable and if he didn't do that over the pulpit he did it back there so god answers prayer i'm just taking my time i'm comfortable today but it's 12 o'clock the clock struck 12. i'm not saying it second corinthians chapter 12. verses 7 to 9. he said lest i should be exalted above measure now think of this this is the bitterness we're talking about this bittersweet lest i be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations so paul had an abundance of revelations those things were sweet to him those things were meek to him and he's actually saying i could be exalted by them so unless i would be exalted above measure through all these sweet wonderful revelations i received there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buff at me lest i should be exalted above measure and so this is a bittersweet experience he's receiving great revelations but at the same time there's a great suffering that's coming to him to keep him in balance but the the revelation alone wasn't going to be what god would use to make him mighty and powerful god was also going to use the suffering god was also going to use the thorn because he says and i sought the lord this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore i rather will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me the power of christ would not merely rest upon him through the sweetness of revelation but through the bitterness of suffering since my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weakness not sweetness it was going to be through the bitterness through the weakness to the suffering through the trial through the hardship that the sweetness would really have a meaning to him i sought the lord to deliver me i sought him and asked him to help me he says my grace is sufficient because in that in that weakness in that pain and in that bitterness my strength is made perfect i could never use you if your mouth was always sweet i could never use you if you were always just sitting in that good i can only use you once it's bitter in your belly i can only use you once it's really dropped to the place where it means something that's when i can use you that's when my per my strength is made perfect so please allow me to mention this that bitterness is not referring to a harsh or negative uh disposition no i've tasted the word and it's so sweet but now it's just it's made me bitter it's made me sour it's made me crabby it's made me mean well because that's what the bible says the bible says i took the book and and it was bitter in my belly but that doesn't mean john had a bitter face you know when someone's eating something drink something bitter eating something bitter like and some of us walk around with a bitter look on our face cantankerous and critical and edgy but that's not what bitterness is talking about why are you so bitter i've taken the book and i've eaten it and i hate all the pentecostals and i hate all the methodists wrong book buddy you haven't eaten this book bitterness that's referred to as the bitterness of suffering the bitterness of hardship that's meant to produce a humility it is the loss due to obedience that's what the bitterness is it's the pain resulting from following truth it's the price for embracing this message that's the bitterness it's not a bad attitude that follows it's not a bitterness that we can see in the scripture that's evil and that's wrong and a root of business but rather it's referring to a suffering a bitterness of suffering it's the difficult in tribulation that comes from doing what is right when i say this ten thousands of my friends will leave me that's the bitterness he didn't say oh i'm so excited to get this tape out because it's finally gonna answer all the critics questions i'm so glad that i could finally preach the seventh seal and i can kind of explain the tent vision a little bit and i can refer to these things that happened at sabino kin i'm so glad that i can do that because now everyone will understand i'm not a neurotic i'm not crazy i was sent for this purpose and brother man was like see i told you this is it he knew that this would be the the nail in their their unbelief the coffin of their own he knew this would seal it he knew this would be what made people think he was crazy i was bittersweet the bitterness in our belly is a result of this word and it's a key to our power because we must experience this part of it the bitterness in our bellies are you doing okay this far i know maybe it's it's getting long and it's dragging a little bit um and i and but i know that most of you are accustomed to teaching ministries and just just word upon word and those things so if i don't move around a lot um and maybe don't get excited just the right way i i apologize do i have permission to wake you up if you fall asleep all right got one here who's agreed anybody else people immediately start yawning too whenever you say that you know i can make you yawn just by doing just by yarn i can make you yawn and you know they say narcissist don't have the ability to do empathetic yawning just just checking you all once you're gonna start doing fake yawns whenever someone yawns now should i should i am i'm a narcissist brother bram says in the message how can i overcome he says jesus told us how to do it how to overcome he told us how to do it he overcome overcome means to stand at the test you have to stand a test you don't have to do it and i was in the meetings here recently when brother danny steeman was preaching and he mentioned how the bride's gonna have to be tested she have to stand the test and he told them he says that doesn't mean you lose your job that's not the test that doesn't mean when you can't make your rent payment he says the whole world suffers that test but the test is being tested by the word that's the test he says to stand the test he said that's right like all the old saints did jesus did amidst all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it and i'm going to skip a little bit because i think this is very relevant to us in this end time because there will be a bride that places death under her feet because he'll bruise satan under your feet shortly the last enemy that's to be defeated is death there will be a bride who will not taste death he says in the presence of death he defeated it he overcome death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the grave he overcame the grave why how how did he do it all by the word and humility all by the word and humility this is very important for us to catch that it was i i listen i i say all the time i'm a word only junkie i'm the word only i believe that i believe the word only but the word only isn't licensed to not have the nature of the word and the atmosphere of the word and to take all that the word covers because the word covers our spirits as much as it does our souls as much as the word applies to physical healing and healing of the soul it applies to our mental attitudes and our emotions and so he says it's all by the word and humility oh my there's the real man there's the one to make your example he defeated everything overcome it how did he overcome it by the word and humility the word could have never worked through arrogance the word could have never worked through carnality it was by the word in humility that he defeated death he's the one to make your example if you are going to defeat death we have the word but we must also have humility [Music] he says overcome how by taking the word the promise in humility humbly walking that's the bitter part if you had a perfect word that was perfectly vindicated you had the the perfect word of god you had thus saith the lord you you were the very you were pure gold and you had all these things we're talking about wouldn't that create a certain attitude that you should probably conduct yourself in such a way for when you go into a restaurant table for ten please a weight sorry you don't obviously you don't you don't know who i am i'm bride yeah pure gold tell that party to move over there tell them to hurry up that's not the way it works it's like that story one time a guy was there was a flight that got cancelled and uh he was there was a long line to get their tickets changed and he just butted right up to the line he says i need my ticket change i need my ticket change right now and i said sir you're going to have to wait your time in line with the rest of the people she says ma'am do you know who i am and so she got on the intercom and she said attention those at gate 12 tension those at gate 12 there's a gentleman at the front desk who forgot who he is [Applause] and if you have that kind of attitude you forgot who you were [Applause] he says in humility humbly walking we have the perfect word but we must have the right attitude and humility in light of the word we can't hold truth and unrighteousness and i think it can be effective brother graham said in harvest time he will judge the church by their attitude towards christ who is the word so attitude is important the kind of attitude that we have not only is our attitude towards the word but it's our attitude with the word brethren makes a statement i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst has it impressed us enough to where we're heavy with it has it laid itself upon us where we feel burdened by how are we sufficiently impressed where we're not stuffed shirt but we're brought low and it's a heaviness to it and it's a way and we recognize how heavy it is we recognize how viable it is we recognize how precious is it's not a light word that just kind of lifts us up and makes us all sweet and arrogant but rather it's something that humbles us are we sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst listen we've had our ears tickled long enough it's time for our bellies to get bitter [Applause] and we'll emphasize this in the afternoon psalm in hebrews chapter 7 part 1 he says your attitude towards christ will make a great impression on what your children will be not whether or not you've received this message believe this message but the attitude with which you carry it the way you conduct yourself with it your life that you live before your family will make an impression on what your children will be we have the word but it's the humility with the word that's going to make a difference in our homes we can't just with arrogance to take the token and beat our children over the head with the token thinking it's going to make the difference it's by the word and humility and the attitude speaks of disposition it speaks of atmosphere it speaks of even this humility of christ the sweet reasonableness of christ who took the authority he had as a son who took the knowledge that he came direct from god and he conducted himself which was very unassuming bill abraham says in the message god had explained he says i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart than to be right in my doctrine and wrong in my heart i would rather be wrong in my doctrine and write in my heart now i'm just going to admit for somebody like me that gets me because i don't think doctrine's a dirty word i believe in doctrine i believe it's in scripture it's doctrine if it's in the message it's doctrine doctrine is teaching my doctrine shall fall forth as reign and this where he was teaching says where he was teaching there was power there to heal them all it's the word that comes from doctrine he was just teaching and i believe in doctor i think it's all doctrine i don't like false doctrine but we can sometimes just wait for me i think there's this maybe a knee-jerk reaction sometimes doctrine oh doctrine's bad no doctrine's not bad you have to have doctrine so this is a balance to me because he says i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart so we cannot take doctrine alone and elevate it above the heart that as long as the doctrine is right we're okay he says i would rather be wrong in my doctrine in write my heart than to be right in my doctrine and wrong in my heart this is the prophet who's given us his rathers and he said i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart and this is very corrective to those of us who who are stickers about teaching and who love doctrine and who thinks that we should be rightly dividing the word of god and really wants to lift up and uphold doctrine but you cannot let that exercise create in you the wrong kind of attitude because there's three scenarios the right doctrine and the wrong heart so you could have the right doctrine and wrong heart or you could have the wrong doctrine in the right heart so in both of those scenarios you're wrong you're either wrong in your doctrine you're wrong in your heart the third scenario is to be right in your doctrine and right in your heart [Applause] and what brother branham said is not giving a preference among three conditions but a pr preference among two conditions because which condition would be most preferred a right wrong or wrong right or right right right or right right right right [Applause] that's what we would prefer we're not reading so i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart so you don't want to be writing doctrine well brother graham said he'd rather be wrong in his doctrine but at least i'm right in my heart well that doesn't even seem to be like the right heart because now you have the wrong attitude towards the right doctor and so what would be better to have the right doctrine and the right heart that's what would be preferred to say i don't care about doctor i just want to be right in my heart that's not the right attitude and neither is i don't care about my attitude because i got the right doctrine to have the kind of attitude where we get lifted up because all seven seals have been opened unto us to get the kind of the wrong kind of ad to get lifted up because we believe these certain things about the bride and her ministry and her calling and what her position is today we have to have the right doctrine and the right attitude in order for that doctrine to be effective brother brahms correcting the wrong attitude that's what he's doing he's correcting the wrong attitude and that's the and that's this is the attitude of the one the one he's corrected i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine than to be right in my doctrine are wrong in my heart he's correcting those who have right doctrine and wrong hearts that's who he's correcting he's not saying it's better to have wrong doctrine but he's correcting those who have the truth but don't hold it in humility he's correcting those who are arrogant with righteousness arrogant with truth arrogant with the things that they have been given [Applause] that's how he says it and get in the spirit i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart god will respect it more so he says so if a man's wrong now what does that bring us to a man who's wrong in his doctrine what of it help him he needs help love him if you can't love your enemy the same as you love those who love you you're no better off than the publicans what is he correcting you have the right doctrine they don't but you can't have the right attitude towards them you have the right doctrine they have wrong doctrine but you can't have the right attitude towards them so he says listen i'd rather be that guy with wrong doctrine in the right heart than you who have the right doctrine and the wrong heart he says so then what you need to do is have the right attitude help him if he needs help if he's wrong then you're right have the right attitude towards him [Applause] [Music] the wrong heart is he refers to it here it's the wrong attitude i believe it speaks of spiritual and emotional maturity i think it deals with elements of pride and selfishness i mean there was brother brown talks about a million more in 44 well now it's us four no more power apart from character satanic i i just want to lay this seat in there we can't properly exercise power or the voice without bitterness when i say bitterness the bitter belly not the wrong attitude but we can't properly exercise power unless bitterness has brought us a humility let me just go further in this journey together the right heart as we may say the right spirit it can be taught that's the beauty when brother abraham says i'd rather be right in my heart and wrong in my doctrine the right heart can be taught right doctor the right heart is in a position where it can be taught and it can grow and learn and it can be corrected to receive right doctrine so a right heart a right spirit can be taught and it can be corrected and that would be maybe the first thing we can identify about having that kind of humility and the right kind of attitude but the component that's most critical to us if we're going to be the final voice to the final age not only can the right attitude be taught but the right attitude can teach if you don't have the right attitude not only can you not be taught you can't properly teach and what good is our right doctrine if we don't have an attitude that can teach it what good is being right about something if you can't convey the correctness of it what's the good of being right if there's an attitude that makes you look wrong what good would it be to have all seven seals open and not have the nature of christ to conduct ourselves in it amen the wrong heart cannot properly be taught nor can it properly teach so what benefit would the right doctrine be in psalms 25 9 the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way think of what jesus said about the meek and those that are poor in spirit the great things that are given to them the meek will he guide and judge the meek will he teaches way why does it the meek are ones who can be taught the meek are the ones that can be guided meek is a mildness of disposition it's a gentleness of spirit it's the opposite of being self-assertive it's the opposite of being arrogant or being selfish and only having yourself in mind it's a mildness of disposition not an iron disposition not an arrogance not but a gentleness of spirit you know in the fruits of the spirit gentleness is the ability to rejoice when others are blessed that's what gentleness is is when you cease god blessing somebody else you can truly rejoice and that kind of gentleness and meekness comes from knowing your position in christ because when you see god blessing somebody else it's not a challenge to your own your own standing in christ when you see somebody else being blessed someone else being used think god doing things in other people's lives or other people's assemblies whatever it might be you can say that's wonderful praise the lord you don't have to say well that's that's this and that's that and deny the lord of god and deny the works that he does you could say you know what i rejoice in that i'm happy with that there's no attitude of self-entitlement to the meek there's no elitism to the meek the meekly guiding judgment the meek will teach his ways so the meek are are not just consumed with their self therefore they're not quick to defend themselves not quick to self-justify it's through meekness that we're able to even be changed by the word of god james 1 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls that's the only way you can receive the word is through meekness the meek will he got him judgment the meekly teaches way i'm just going through these scriptures very quickly to show by the word and humility this humility that's necessary with the word when the word comes to you it's the only way that we can truly be taught is to have the right kind of attitude the right kind of heart the right kind of spirit to have this meekness and humility that's the way that we're taught but it's also the way that we can teach the meek receive correction but we should only correct through meekness we don't go to the one and we try to correct them and you should do this and you should do that and they don't receive and say well you're just not meek if you're a meek you could receive correction it says in galatians 6 1 brethren if a man be overtaken in the fall ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted it's an attitude that's not condescending it's not judgmental it's not dangling somebody over hell or holding their feet to the fire or trying to say well you're just a bunch of serpent seed because you can't listen to what this correction but no you go to him the spirit of meekness we're talking about bittersweet this is the bitter belly revelations chapter four part three brother says god never sent brother neville and i to be bosses not at all we're just your brothers see instructors in the gospel so let's all work together and sometime and let me just say this brother chad and i fellowship a little bit of the last couple days on accountability and mutual dependency among the parts in the body and and this is what i believe brother branham lifts up many times when he speaks about church order and the way the church operated he never made one man the dictator in the church but each office and each member were mutually dependent upon each other there wasn't a co-dependency where everyone's just relying on the pastor and he's the he's the god of the church and we're just going to follow after him whatever he says whatever he does but no he's dependent upon you he's depend on other offices officers are dependent on him and we're all mutually dependent that way there's no code dependency and where there's no codependency there's no manipulation there's no abuse there's no control so he says we're not you're we're not your bosses he says and let me just say this when brother brown says your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking what he was saying is your husband is your pastor spiritually speaking your husband is your spiritual pastor so he wasn't telling everybody here that brother chad's your husband and so you can say well i've got a wife at home and a husband at church no i'm a pastor to my wife that's why she's that's how she's a pastor in the home how she's a co-pastor she's the associate pastor and this is how that's what brother brown was trying to lift up not try to make the pastor the husband would you go do that without asking your pastor would you go do that without asking your husband how could you go on vacation and i'll ask your husband that's a good point i wouldn't go on vacation without asking my husband and they use that to try to tell you gotta you gotta ask your pastor first before you can buy a car before you can do this before you do that why they've manipulated the word and made it something that's not your husband in your home is your spiritual pastor that's why the bible tells the women to learn at home ask their questions at home be in subjection to their own husbands it says it was a little bit of an aside there i apologize for the the trail but he's laying this out we're not to be bosses we're instructors in the gospels so let's all work together and sometime if something operating has to be called or said something said about it called down or something like order and that person that's got that gifts rejects it refuses it remember the gift wasn't right so he's talking about gifts being placed in the church and then being in subjection answering the right way being used the right way he says it wasn't god in the first place and then he says this and this is applicable to what he's saying but it's applicable in general the spirit of god always is ready for correction sweet and humble willing regardless of the context the spirit of god is always ready for correction sweet humble and willing see if it stands up says i'll do it anyhow you know how sometimes so he just stops he says just remember arrogant spirits are not of god if you didn't write anything down i've said this morning write it down borrow pen paper i'll email it to you text it i'll tweet it i'll instagram it i'll snapchat it arrogant spirits are not of god [Applause] we can never be arrogant and be operating under the spirit and influence of jesus christ the spirit of god is always ready for correction sweet humble and willing arrogant spirits are not of god so this great sweetness that we take into our mouth we begin to eat this message and eat this book and we're eating the unfailing body word of the son of man and we're to prophesy again we do not prophesy with the taste of sweetness in our mouth we prophesy with the feeling of bitterness in our belly otherwise we would not prophesy correctly we could get lifted up in our flesh it's that great paradox of having the divine inside of us wrapped around a bunch of carnality and god brings the bitterness that we might bring the carnality under subjection and it's through bitterness that humility and meekness overwhelm our being think of where you would be without suffering think of where you would be without great loss where would you be if you had not lost family where would you be if you had not suffered great tribulation where would we be we would be arrogant the arrogant spirits are not of god the question answers on the seals brother i said will the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture sure that's what's going on right now the bride of christ certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour and that language the bride of christ the great ministry the minister of the hour the full measure all these things his body his voice perform his works it creates in your minds and in the natural mind something very very great but he says it'll be so humble now remember he says how many was here last sunday remember what i preached on humility and his title was god hiding himself in simplicity but the simplicity was synonymous with humility oh don't forget that he says i'm going to stop a minute to warn that again remember when god predicts anything great to happen the people are looking so far away by their wisdom until they miss what happens when god says anything is great the world laughs at it that bunch of ignoramuses that's right but when the great world and the great high church said boy that's glorious god says a bunch of ignoramuses he says you have to watch he said i don't mean maybe it that way exactly that way but that's the way that it is power's sweet but humility is bitter it's the bride's bittersweet ministry it's going to be great and big in the eyes of god but not great and big in the eyes of the world we're not going to be able to do everything just exactly right and all of a sudden our neighbors be like okay i get it now you're good websites are going to shut down because you're able to you're able to produce an apologetic manual that explains every inconsistency every question everything about the message places everything just right and then everyone's the critics going gonna go you know what we retract what we've said before we welcome you to the club of those accepted ways of worshiping christ it'll never happen as a matter of fact it's just the line keeps getting drawn tighter and tighter where you're excluded more and more often from acceptable means of worship and god in simplicity is brother ben i made reference back to that he says remember what i preached last sunday he said remember friend don't look for great big you say god he speaks of a great big things there'll come a time there'll be this that or the other great big things he says i hope you're catching what i'm talking about great big things and i believe that he is specifically identifying how that the world expects the open of those seals the reveal of the son of man those that this the things that were transparent at that very moment where these things have been preached the world was expecting it to be that messiah would go stand over on a mountain with a mile long spear and pick people off he said it was so humble the prophet missed it so there's something about the son of man and there's something about the bride where it's so humble because it's not great big that would satisfy the flesh but it's actually so humble it's a bitterness to our belly so oh when it comes to pass it be great big big like this and it'll be so humble you'll miss the whole thing and just go right on you'll look back and say well that never did come pass right over the top and you've never seen it it's so simple god lives in simplicity to manifest his self in greatness if i could just say this the reason why you have so many eight messengers is because they missed christ because it was so humble and since they didn't see christ they're so arrogant to think that they could be it because in its humility it was missed it's so simple god lives in simplicity to manifest himself in greatness what makes him great because he can simplify himself a big great man can't simplify himself he's got to be a dignitary but he ain't big enough yet when he becomes big enough then he comes down like this and can humble himself isn't that beautiful the emphasis here isn't just calling out the unbeliever who can't see it so he's not just trying to make the point ah the unbeliever he'll never see it he'll never see it why because it's so humble he's instructing us it's instructive to the bride it's corrective to the bride you can't get lifted up in this inappropriately we want to be lifted up in the spirit of the lord we want to be lifted up raised up in heavenly places in christ jesus want to soar like an eagle in the sky but it's not it's there's an opposite thing that's taking place in our flesh he's correcting the bride we got to humble ourselves to be so humble god lives in simplicity manifest himself in greatness if he wants to manifest himself in greatness he has to first live in humility and simplicity whether it says god revealing himself in humility that's where god hides god hides in humility so if god's going to be expressed he has to first be hidden in humility this is the bride's bittersweet ministry full of his power full of his glory bone of his bone flesh of his flesh pure gold yet meek and humble all right let's all stand on our feet for a moment it's 12 31 by my clock just stand on your feet just just stand preston you can stretch a little bit exercise yourself everybody everybody doing good are you doing good all is well stretch stretch get comfortable all right you can be seated i know somebody was asleep and thought yes where are the musicians why aren't they singing take the name of jesus with you brother branham says that's what makes him god to me because he humbled himself god is humility don't ever forget that humility is god never boastful it's always humility brother brown makes this statement i hope you can just take this to your heart this is the this is the bitter belly that john experienced he says not saying anything against people but when you see a person that's got the answer to everything that's contrary to the word and don't leave and say i don't know to the first question you hear just because you want to you know line up with this and then have the answer the rest of the time but he's identifying an attitude you see a person that's got the answer to everything that's contrary to the word i call it the thing of it is scenario syndrome where no matter what quote you share no matter what you say no matter what principles presented they say well the thing of it is and they've got an explanation that's different than what you just read or different than what you understand he's identifying an attitude and an arrogance when you see a person that's got the answer to everything that's contrary to the word it says in the message humble thyself there in the summer of 1963 i've always found out that the man that humbles himself is the man that god exalts when you take a person with his chest out and knows everything and you can't tell him nothing and he's arrogant well that's the person that never gets anywhere but you take that person that humbles themselves and walks sweetly if the bride is going to arrive at her destination she's going to have to walk humbly walk simply walk sweetly why because jesus showed us the way to do it he's the one to make your example all by the word and humility how did he do it by humility humbly walking he says a man who is arrogant with his chest out knows everything got an answer to every question he says that's contrary to the word that person will never get anywhere but he takes the person that humbles themselves and walks sweetly again and humble thyself you know people want power really they want to know what power is they don't really know what goes with it can you see the i i just see so plainly why the lord led me this way and looking at this subject the bitter sweetness to it the power the glory the manifestations all the things that are spoken about the bride the ministry that's represented in revelations 10 11 but then yet there's a bitter belly that precedes it before that because she can't be verse 11 unless she's experienced verse 10. she has to take the book it has to be sweet to her she has to eat all of it but then it has to be in her belly a bitterness there has to be a consequence and so brother bam says they don't really know what goes with power the way up is down if you want power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before god and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ to humble yourself before him that's really power sometimes we think the powers and how loud and how boisterous and how uh emotional people get but he says power is conquering yourself and completing yourself to christ to humble yourself before he says you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogant church just a sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has the favor and power of god in it is that not what we desire to aspire to is the fact that we could be a church that's humble real humble not arrogant just sweet humble he says i'll show you a church that the favor and power of god is in oh may the favor of god be in our midst may the power of god be in our midst and it's not going to be through being loud and boisterous and arrogant but a church that's humble real humble sweet a sweet humble church a church that knows what bitterness is you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogant church that's a church that has favor and the power of god that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before god and letting god just work through us that sweetness in john's mouth soon became bitterness and it was through that bitterness that he was bowed over and it was then from that position of weakness and harm the position of pain and sorrow that god said you must prophesy again can i get just personal for a moment it's a slight nod i may never preach in another church as beautiful as this one as far as the amenities the construction and where else can a preacher have this many things at a pulpit if i wanted to do transparencies i have a vintage service i could put them up here i could hook my laptop there i could control i could do powerpoint i could do everything from here everything's taken care of every monitor is just done just right every office has a computer got printers everything the amenities and the beauty of this church and the things if you invited somebody to church i mean there's no shame in this building there's no shame in the comfortable chairs there's no shame and how well you're all dressed and there's not a real big approach maybe to a lot of things that you can say about this church this is a beautiful beautiful church in terms of its facilities and its offices and its administration and all those things and there's a lot of things that you've enjoyed for many many years that perhaps it was a great pride to you just how beautiful this is but the beauty of the church is not the building it's the character of the people and character can only be forged through suffering and perhaps what this great big beautiful building can hide sometimes is the great bitterness that we have in ourselves not the bitterness of an arrogance but the humility that's being wrought by pain and suffering and the things that we go through and we cannot allow the comfortableness of our assembly and the beautiful things of our amenities and our fellowships and all the technology and the things that we have ever rob us from the humble attitude before christ that we're nothing without you lord show me a church that's humble real humble and that's a church that has the favor and power of god in it brother branham writes in church age book chapter four just just to maybe give you all some hope this is all i have left this is it so it's just a quote a scripture a quote another scripture and two other scriptures and a quote just just just that you can you read that can you see that it's eight point font and a little seven mixed in there some six mixed in there but that's that's all i've got left if you're zooming in if you're watching live streaming and they zoomed in give a real tight shot you know exactly where i'm going bibram says it's strange that god wants to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we're all tried and chastened to sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god so we could take comfort in that the church is not suffering it's not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god a church that doesn't suffer isn't of god paul writes to timothy 2 timothy chapter 2 verse 3 thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ a church that is not enduring hardness that is not suffering is not being tried it isn't of god because all children must be tried and chastened and corrected therefore endure hardness as a good soldier it means suffer trouble endure affliction as a good soldier of jesus christ when it says endure hardness it doesn't mean become hard it doesn't mean become calloused doesn't mean to become bitter towards other people and suspicious and withdraw yourself and close yourself off but endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ he's not telling us that through difficulty through pain and suffering we should ever become hardened in the wrong kind of way that we should ever get our spirits with an iron disposition and we just get so stiff and we still get so rigid and we get so cast because i've been hurt i've been hurt i've been hurt and we allow that to make us hard no he's not saying endure hardness in the way that you become hard but there's a softness that comes when you go through it because you're a church of god that's suffering you're being tried because you're of god and it doesn't make you arrogant it doesn't make you haughty it makes you humble oh how easy it would be oh we're suffering because we've got the truth we're suffering because we got the truth that's the wrong kind of attitude what was the attitude of david per adventure god told him to do that maybe god told them to do that maybe i am suffering because of something i did lord i know i'm not perfect maybe maybe i didn't maybe i haven't always done things right and we're not just quick to play the card that oh we've got the truth card because he said there's no true believer free from it talk about the suffering this is of god this is the will of god it is needful suffering bitterness we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it that's the key we can all take some comfort from knowing that we're to suffer but the real challenge is to be christ-like in doing it to suffer and be christ-like in doing it jesus christ was meek and lowly the bible says he was a man of sorrows acquainted with grief despised and rejected isaiah 53 7 he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before his shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth this is where i'm ending my journey today it's 12 41 i begin a little bit after 11 so i know i've been lengthy the son of man was smitten he was afflicted he was tortured the bible says he came to his own his own received him not he was branded a a heretic a blasphemer beelzebub i could go on and on for an hour and not be finished with the scriptures and quotes that describe the humility of christ his brokenness there was nothing and no beauty in him that we would desire him he was in his early 30s and they thought he was a man around 50. there's no charisma about him apparent to the way he looked and there was just something that you wouldn't be drawn to him just by his stature even his reputation a man whose his birth is suspicious a man whose labor and his calling was nothing to brag about he didn't come from the courts he didn't come from the palace just a humble nazarene yet there was something that god was right bring it out of his experience the bible says he learned obedience by the thing which he suffered and being made perfect became the captain of our salvation he learned obedience to the things which he suffered it was the suffering that was bringing out the gold and bringing to the surface the real character and deity of jesus christ that's why when he would speak he said never a man spake like this man it wasn't because he came direct from the portals of heaven and was robed in gowns and was dressed in such a way he wasn't a saul head and shoulders above everyone else that this man when he speaks he must be a king he's tall he's got a deep voice he's got a charisma about him but yet he was broke so broken so reflected so rejected that his words could have a greater weight and just as the son of man was smitten we must also be smitten to have the same ministry because you are the very manifestation of god on earth and because you're the very manifestation of god on earth there's great opposition and you'll suffer and be afflicted just the same as christ was but the power and glory of christ that i read to you through the first hour or so however long it was just trying to lay that foundation and it only comes through bitterness difficulty trial a struggle humility weakness he says when i'm weak when paul recognizes when i'm weak i'm strong his strength is made perfect and a weakness so i'll glory in the bitterness that the power of christ may rest in me revelations 10 11 he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and brother brown makes this statement in the masterpiece now in order for this to speak he is the word and for the word to speak he must come into the image has he done that in this hour that was the last part for he himself to step into this he must he says he must come into the image and then for the image to speak it's got to be smitten for the image to speak it must be struck hard it's what it means to be smitten it must be afflicted visited with disaster that's in order for us to speak if the bride we must prophesy again and as we ready ourselves oh my we're going to prophesy we've got a great work to do we're going to be the son of man in flesh we've got this thing oh my we're going to be a great church a glorious church a church without spot a wrinkle a super race an invincible army and he steps into her and we have the sweetness of the presence of christ we have the glory and the power of christ that we begin to recognize in our midst and we're becoming sufficiently impressed he says but before you can speak you've got to be smitten you've got to be visited with disaster you've got to be overwhelmed and struck hard before you can speak and i believe that god is in the midst of his bride that he himself has come in to his image and the image must speak and therefore she must be smitten you've been smitten so that you could speak you're smitten so you can be a credible voice the word is very sweet in our mouths but it becomes bitter in our belly why so we can speak to be smitten also has another meaning to be inspired with love we're smitten we've been smitten so we're inspired to speak regardless of the test regardless of the difficulty regardless if tens of thousands of my friends walk away from me i've got to speak this i'll ask the musicians to come and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey have we experienced that and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter this is the consequence for eating this message not just sweetness in our mouths but bitter in our bellies and i shared this with you as we close maybe the musicians can play in the key of g my hope is in the lord let me just encourage you to eat it till you feel it keep feeding on it keep embracing it [Music] and i know that it'll be great bitterness in your belly but it's worth it we should eat it till it hurts he said as soon as i began to take the book so i began to eat it it was sweetness in my mouth [Music] but once i took it all and it entered into my belly there there it was bitter [Music] i know we go through difficult times to go through trials it's bittersweet isn't it believing this message is bittersweet but it has a purpose lord let this sweetness together with this bitterness bring out the sweet fragrance of christ let it produce a christ-like behavior in the midst of trials that you and your wisdom allowed to come to pass allow it the lord to bring forth the christ-like behavior when i suffer for your name's sake it's bittersweet but oh what a great calling we have in this hour let's stand to our feet i encourage you to eat eat this book feed on this book take it into your bosom swallow all of it and let your bowels be full of it [Music] as we rejoice in the sweetness we can glory in the bitterness lord i'm not ashamed of the bitterness in my belly lord is producing in me a nature and a character let's commiserate with the very character and nature of christ if we're gonna be the final voice to the final age then we must be smitten perhaps we'd be willing to say lord smite us lord if i truly be the final voice to the final age that smite be lord that i might smear speak lord lord for you have come into the image and i want it to be loosed i want to be free lord smite me i invite anyone here who needs to touch from the lord who's felt that the lord has brought some correction maybe some drawing of his love and his grace to you just open up your heart to him today and receive him lord don't let his presence pass you by don't let it pass you by without you saying lord here i am lord i'm here to be spoken to lord i'm here to be changed lord i know this i can speak this with plainness in my heart this church has gone through great affliction and great trial don't let it harden your hearts don't let it make you can't be callous say lord today i allow this bitterness to humble me lord the gift of the rejection of my family the rejection by those i love the loss of spouses whatever it might be lord i will allow it to humble me that i may come to you and to be lifted up oh god allow us to be humble before you that's our prayer that's our cry let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer lord our gracious heavenly father i pray now in your divine presence that you would show a grace to these people the ones who are hurting lord the ones who've been buffeted [Music] the ones that have experienced many blows lord what's so remarkable to me is that that meek nature that meek spirit just takes it they don't try to defend themselves they don't try to deflect the blows they don't try to self-justify it they don't even try to tear down the offender the one that's punching them they just take it when they're buffeted lord if there be anyone here today who through the difficulties of life and through the bitterness that they've experienced by taking this book lord may they not shove the book away lord may they not try to fix the bitterness in their belly lord may they not get arrogant or lifted up with pride as a means of protecting their spirits but lord may they humble themselves before you today for father we believe that we are to be the final voice to the final age we believe that we're eating on this book and the book is sweet father if we're gonna truly prophesy it must be bitter in our bellies it's bitter sweet lord but we thank you for it i commit the people to you now desiring that your holy spirit work in their hearts as we worship and i i sits and just feel a little bit of longing in my heart maybe a little lacking that may just be on myself my part lord but i pray you come and you do the next part you take care of the next part i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i stand in all within the presence of the lord from whom the raging of the seas sacrifice the only source of life is [Music] his tender mercies come within rise to offer healing and forgiveness and those who trust in him will find their hearts that raise my hopes is the door [Music] is is [Music] my hope is in the

my sermon's been bittersweet but i trust that it would be effective in your hearts pray for me i had more to share perhaps maybe we continue on this thought this afternoon but i just want to obey the lord but we love you maybe we can sing that course we are the generation we're the culmination the final voice the world will hear we are the generation we are the culmination the final voice the world we're here the lord is near living out the revelation overcoming the truth with every tongue in nations we are the culmination temptation [Music] let's just lift our and voices are the generations foreign hallelujah praise the lord how many feel like you've got good instruction and correction today amen we've said this before but it it it means so much right now to me that god had one purpose one goal one thing he wanted to accomplish and it come in three parts first to get preeminence in a man and he did that in christ jesus second to have premise and a bride and he's doing that now jesus was an example of what preeminence looked like spit on and didn't spit back rowed against and riled not back was hated but loved in return it's a high order friends it's a perfect example it's a high calling but that's our calling what he demonstrated were also to demonstrate amen it's sobering because in the flesh we know it's impossible in the flesh the only thing that's possible is defense arrogance hate bitter response but that's why the flesh has to die so that the spirit of god can dwell in and live and bring all the attributes of christ out of the seed this is a good time to die all over again die we thought we were dead but we realized we got to be more dead and more dead and more dead so that he can have absolute preeminence in his mind that's what we all want it's what we're honing for we're wrestling with the flesh but we just need to surrender to the power of the word and let god have his way amen god through our brother aaron so clearly articulated exactly what he's looking for in this day and it's the cry that's deep within let's just surrender to him and let him have his way say god i've recognized there's more there there's still too much self right i think it's faith fair and safe to say there's still too much self and we want less of self we want it to be all of him and we just appreciate what god spoke to us today i mean as we part and as we sing and pray walk out those doors let it not just be a sermon that was good let it be more than that let's chew on it amen let's chew it let's swallow it let's digest it amen let's make this sermon live because it wasn't just a sermon it was god speaking to his children and god sharing with us what he wants in this day and what light is supposed to shine in this hour i say god let it be manifest right here amen praise be to god we love you with the love of the lord we're going to let you go and we just want everybody to know we'll be back here for the afternoon service you're welcome to come to be here at 3 30 we'll start the singing at 3 30 come in early to be in prayer if you're able to and then we'll have communion service immediately after the preaching amen you know this don't consume me lord can we sing that song consuming you know i just want to make this comment before we sing this traditionally when we understand things that bear light oil lamps candles fire whatever item is going to be used to fuel that light has to be consumed in order to give life and god wants to shine his light through flesh bodies but he's got to consume the flesh part of us the carnal part has got to be consumed that the light of god the light of god the gospel the word christ light can be made manifest how many want to be further consumed today burn it out of me lord burn all of self out of me burn selfishness burn pride burn air burn all of it out of me lord so that your gospel light can shine and guess what it shines as it consumes i want to be fully consumed let's sing this together before you're dismissed me [Music] and bless the broken pieces [Music] lord [Music] me make me me [Music] [Music] fears [Laughter] [Music] love [Music] by his word [Music] is is by
