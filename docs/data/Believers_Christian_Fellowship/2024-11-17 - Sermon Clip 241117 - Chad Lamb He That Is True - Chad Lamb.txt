TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we go back for years we would read John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God we say oh that's Jesus Christ right there but brother bandham tells us you're right there amen he said you know he says You must find yourself in scripture amen if you are a child of God an attribute of God part of the word when it says in the beginning was the word you are included in that scripture now we could be wrong we could be self-deceived we could have the wrong idea we could claim to be something we're not but there is a reality on this earth now there are those attributes living in flesh that were part of the mind of God before the foundation of the world Amen I believe it by faith I could be completely deceived but I don't have any way to prove it the only way that I can prove it to myself is that I believe it from the bottom of my toes to the top of my head I believe it unreasonably I believe it ridiculously but I can't prove it neither can you prove it we may all in this room be sitting and it may be wrong we may not be who we think we are but it doesn't change the fact that it's still true it's still the absolute truth that God's desire was to manifest himself in flesh and he's been portioning out his attributes All Through Time and those attributes would come into manifestation which were his thoughts expressing something of his nature something of his plan and he was expressing it all down through time and every time they expressed it that was Christ the anointed word that was God moving through his word to express him self from cover to cover it was Jesus Christ and where did we find it we found it in people all the way down through and we have no problem saying yeah Paul's one of them and Peter's one of them and David's got to be included and this one's got to be included amen that's fine and that's wonderful but that doesn't do me any good you know what gives me Faith you know what helps me overcome you know what helps me bring this guy into submission is when I realized it wasn't just David and it it wasn't just Paul and it wasn't just Peter but it's me too and now because it's me it matters how I live it matters how I talk it matters what I see it matters where I go cuz I was not here to have pleasure I've not been put here to live my life I've been put here to manifest Jesus Christ the word anointed word for this age and I may only have one little tiny expression but I want to express that tiny expression because that tiny expression is part of God God it is the thought of God from before the foundation of the world that he wants to express through a physical body on this Earth in this day you see this is why the message came to break away denomination to break away Church holds to break away confusion amen because we were trying to serve God by a system we try to serve God by an order we tried to serve God but we didn't realize we weren't going to please God by keeping an order we're not going to please God by agreeing with a tenant or agreeing with a Doctrine we're only going to please God when he has full sway in our life and can manifest what was in his mind through our flesh from before the foundation of the world that's what God's looking for amen
