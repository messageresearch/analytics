TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation God is creating himself in you where you literally become a full manifestation and expression of God himself I mean that's that's hard and hard to grasp and understand but how is this possible because he plays within you a seed that seed can only produce the life that is in it the life of the seed that was in you was God what can it produce it can only produce God now that seed has to come to full manifestation has to come to full maturity and so what is it trying to do now that seed that was placed in you is trying to come into full manifestation expression where you yourself will be the full expression of God himself just like God came in Jesus Christ now God is coming in you because God wants to express himself through you but you have to yield to him it isn't what's it isn't you trying to do something for God it's you dying out to yourself so God can live his life through you so all of a sudden now God has a vessel so that so that he he can do what he's wanting to do through you I mean you you look at what I'm part of the fire department a volunteer um we go to the biggest problem we have is is the drug overdoses and when you go into a house and you see these guys which have been which have that Spirit on them that Spirit controls that body I mean he has no she has no control of himself that Spirit literally controls that body and so we give him Narcan try and bring him around and and sometimes we're successful sometimes we're not but it's interesting to look and to look at the household and look at the the way they're living and all the others that that demon is so has so possessed them where really they have no control over any aspect of their life well flip that over to the other side if we will take and allow God to have total possession of us then then then he can do through us the same thing he did through brother Branham or Jesus Christ or Paul or Peter any of the rest of them it's it's us yielding to him it's us allowing him to have total preeminence and control in our lives and that's where we have to come because we're the Bride of this age we this is this is what we're predestinated to we are predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son we will be exact image exact replica of him
