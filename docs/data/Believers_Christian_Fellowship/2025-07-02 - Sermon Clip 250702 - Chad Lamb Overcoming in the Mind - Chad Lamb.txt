TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hey, listen. We've got to focus on the things that are true, the things that are honest, the things that are lovely, the things that are just, the things that be of good report. And if there's any praise, if it's worthy of any praise, think on these things and don't think on the other things. Refuse to let it have access to your mind. And refuse to let your mind wander all in dark, gloomy places. Bring it back to the truth, to the word of God, and say the word is true and everything else is a lie. That absolutely blessed me so much when I read that that we can get ourselves in such a dark spot over nothing. So I'm not going to let myself get in a dark spot. And by the help of God, I want to focus on that which is true and lovely and just and of good report and of praise because that's the truth. And if I've done something wrong, God will tell me. He's not going to let me wander all over the place not knowing. But I'm not going to start making up things and gloomy thoughts and gloom and doom over nothing over nothing. I'd rather go on blissfully ignorant that I've ever done anything wrong and be happy and joyful and a son of God and happy with every day of my life because I have a heavenly father and he loves me and wait for the time that God says, "Listen, you've missed it, but here it is." And then I can deal with it. Then I know I can repent. I can deal with it. I can make it right. But until then, I'm not going to start inventing. Well, maybe it's this and maybe it's that and maybe it's this and maybe it's that and maybe it's me and maybe it's not me. Maybe it's the people around me. Maybe it's my husband. Maybe it's my wife. Maybe it's my parents. Maybe I got an evil spirit on me from generation. Maybe it's the church I'm in. Maybe it's Satan. That's how he works with negative thinking. We got to throw that away and say there's nothing wrong between me and God. And if there is, he'll show me. He's a good father. He's a heavenly father. He doesn't want me to live in gloom. He wants me to be free in order to be free. He's got to tell me what's wrong. And if he doesn't tell me what's wrong, nothing's wrong. Praise God. You say, "Oh, I don't want to be a fool." I'd rather be a happy fool than a gloomy fool. I'd rather be a happy fool. Ignorant. Everybody else can look at you and say, "Your life is all messed up, but I'm happy anyhow." Rather than overanalyzing, coming too critical and trying to analyze everything that happens and become doom and gloom and everything's bad and yes, we'll never have victory in this battle that way. Always be defeated.
