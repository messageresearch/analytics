[0:00] praise the lord while we're standing
[0:01] let's take our bibles and turn to
[0:03] revelations chapter four
[0:04] we'll go quickly into the word we're
[0:06] going to keep on with the seals

[0:12] revelation to us so we can see amen what

[0:43] we saw you
[0:45] it's god's law of multiplication praise
[0:47] the lord so we're happy to see you here
[0:49] amen let's let's begin reading here in
[0:53] revelations chapter 4
[0:56] verse 1. after this i looked and behold
[1:00] a door was open in heaven and the first
[1:02] voice which i heard was as it were
[1:04] of a trumpet talking with me which said
[1:07] come up hither and i will
[1:08] show thee things which must be
[1:10] hereafter.
[1:12] and immediately i was in the spirit and
[1:13] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:15] one side on the throne
[1:17] and he that sat was to look upon like
[1:19] jasper and sardine stone and there was a
[1:21] rainbow round about the throne
[1:23] in sight like unto an emerald and around
[1:25] about the throne were four and twenty
[1:27] seats and upon the seats i saw four and
[1:29] twenty elders sitting
[1:31] clothed in white raiment and they had on
[1:33] their heads crowns of gold
[1:35] and out of the throne proceeded
[1:36] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[1:39] and there were seven lamps of fire
[1:40] burning before the throne
[1:42] which are the seven spirits of god and
[1:44] before the throne there was a sea of
[1:46] glass like under crystal and in the
[1:48] midst of the thrones
[1:49] and round about the throne were four
[1:52] beasts full of eyes before
[1:54] and behind and the first beast was like
[1:56] a lion and the second beast like a calf
[1:59] and the third beast had a face as a man
[2:01] and the fourth beast
[2:02] was like a flying eagle and the four
[2:05] beasts had
[2:05] each of them six wings about him and
[2:08] they were full of eyes within
[2:11] within and they rest not day and night
[2:13] saying holy holy holy lord god almighty
[2:16] which was and is and is to come
[2:19] amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly
[2:21] father we ask that you would come to us
[2:23] now lord
[2:25] and you would just teach us lord just
[2:26] speak to us just open our hearts to
[2:29] receive your word lord i pray that you
[2:30] would take this vessel of clay
[2:32] and that you by the power of your holy
[2:34] spirit would begin to operate lord
[2:36] and speak words of eternal life through
[2:38] these lips lord
[2:39] that we might hear what you have for us
[2:41] now that we might understand
[2:43] what you're trying to teach us by
[2:45] revelation lord and that we might grow
[2:47] in that grace and knowledge of you lord
[2:49] i pray that you have your way have
[2:51] preeminence in this place tonight
[2:53] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[2:56] you can all be seated praise the lord
[3:01] i just want to remind everybody that
[3:02] we're going to have two services this
[3:04] sunday so it's going to be
[3:05] a little different a little bit special
[3:07] i'm going to take the morning service
[3:08] but then in the afternoon we have
[3:10] brother already robertson visiting with
[3:12] us so he's going to take the second
[3:13] service
[3:14] and we're going to shoot for about four
[3:15] o'clock to have that second service so
[3:18] we hope that you'll be able to
[3:20] come back for that one and then pray for
[3:22] brother craig he's traveling out friday
[3:24] him and his family
[3:25] to go to west virginia to preach for
[3:27] brother tim mckinney
[3:28] and then from there he goes to north
[3:30] carolina because he's ministering
[3:32] thursday night at the missions
[3:33] conference so just remember to keep him
[3:35] in prayer
[3:36] during that time and then if we could
[3:39] bring up the powerpoint please
[3:41] i think this evening on one sunday we
[3:44] talked about the
[3:46] first seal and we showed how how god had
[3:49] a method here in operating and he shows
[3:52] us through the scriptures
[3:53] but i want to take the time to talk
[3:54] about the four beasts this evening
[3:57] because this is an important very
[3:58] important subject and some things we
[4:00] need to understand
[4:01] as we go along here so we see we're
[4:04] talking about the seven sealed
[4:06] book of redemption and you know the most
[4:09] important thing in the prophet's
[4:11] ministry was the opening of these seals
[4:14] it meant everything to him and and it
[4:16] means so much to us
[4:17] if if you brought your seal book there's
[4:19] something i want to look at here in the
[4:21] fifth seal
[4:24] and the fifth seal and i understand not
[4:26] everybody has the exact same seal book
[4:28] but in mine it's page 301 in the fifth
[4:31] seal
[4:32] and it's paragraph 35
[4:35] of the fifth seal page 301
[4:39] but i just want to read this together
[4:41] because i want you to see brother
[4:42] mentions
[4:43] this or phrases like this many many
[4:47] times in the seals
[4:48] he said you can't possibly hit all the
[4:50] things
[4:51] because you could take that just one of
[4:53] those seals and stay
[4:55] just bring it right through the
[4:56] scripture right down see
[4:58] it'd take months and months and months
[5:00] and you still wouldn't have it
[5:02] because the seal itself ties the entire
[5:04] scripture
[5:05] from genesis to revelations one seal of
[5:08] it
[5:10] my goodness i think there's something we
[5:13] we need to see
[5:14] he's saying one seal one seal of it
[5:18] ties the entire scripture from genesis
[5:21] revelations
[5:23] my i say god open my eyes open them
[5:26] wider than they've ever been give me
[5:27] revelation on your word
[5:29] you know because brother branham taught
[5:31] us that on them tapes and them seals
[5:33] on them tapes is rapturing grace is that
[5:36] what he told us
[5:38] so so they took from the tapes and they
[5:40] transcribed into a book
[5:42] so in this book is rapturing grace
[5:46] but there has to be a transition from
[5:48] rapturing grace
[5:49] grace is unmerited favor we didn't earn
[5:52] the opening of the seals
[5:53] we didn't deserve the opening of the
[5:55] seals we didn't deserve to be placed in
[5:57] the seven seal book of redemption we
[5:59] didn't deserve to have part of that
[6:00] inheritance
[6:01] and our name recorded under that
[6:02] inheritance and then we didn't deserve
[6:04] to have it
[6:05] unlocked in our day and revealed and
[6:07] given to us we didn't deserve that it
[6:09] was grace
[6:11] so when you listen to that tape that is
[6:12] the grace of god to you
[6:14] when you hold this book the
[6:15] transcription of the tape that is the
[6:17] grace of god to you
[6:20] but we have to go through a transition
[6:22] phase because
[6:23] grace has to turn into rapturing faith
[6:28] amen is that true and we haven't come to
[6:30] rapturing faith yet because the moment
[6:32] you receive rapturing faith
[6:34] then there's nothing that can stop you
[6:35] from taking a rapture
[6:38] so we've got to come to a full rapturing
[6:40] faith so there's a process that has to
[6:42] go from rapturing
[6:45] rapturing grace to rapturing faith and
[6:47] that process is revelation because faith
[6:49] is a revelation
[6:51] so we have what we need what we we've
[6:53] been given the grace we've been given
[6:55] the word
[6:56] we've been given the unlocked mysteries
[6:58] and now what we need is
[6:59] revelation of what we're holding in our
[7:01] hands what's coming into our ears
[7:04] and that revelation faith is a
[7:07] revelation
[7:08] so rapturing faith is rapturing
[7:10] revelation
[7:11] of the rapturing grace hallelujah
[7:15] how many is happy to be alive right now
[7:17] this moment in time
[7:19] i would rather be here than anywhere i'd
[7:21] rather be right where i know
[7:23] god is continually unveiling himself
[7:25] taking the rapturing grace by revelation
[7:28] producing rapturing faith
[7:30] and we we caught the principle of god
[7:32] and we don't want to miss this
[7:33] because there's the difference between
[7:34] church life and spirit life
[7:36] church life and the message would have
[7:38] you come into
[7:40] another system of belief forsaking
[7:42] another one moving into another one
[7:44] because you see that it's right
[7:45] you agree with it you see that it
[7:47] matches the scripture but once you make
[7:49] this transition
[7:50] now church life the deception of the
[7:53] white horse rider
[7:54] would then move you into this this this
[7:57] new church
[7:58] this new belief this new system and then
[8:00] have you plant yourself there
[8:02] and coast all the way waiting for some
[8:05] magic wand some fairy dust something
[8:07] magical to happen
[8:08] to to give you rapturing faith and bring
[8:10] you in a rapture that's church life
[8:14] that's the deception of the antichrist
[8:16] he doesn't mind if you believe or quote
[8:18] or
[8:18] or confess he doesn't believe that he
[8:20] just doesn't want you to grow in
[8:22] rapturing faith
[8:24] he doesn't want your faith to increase
[8:26] as long as you can make this transition
[8:28] and stay there
[8:29] you'll be fine but when you start to
[8:32] grow that's when you get in trouble
[8:34] and the apostle paul said grow in grace
[8:36] and the knowledge of jesus christ
[8:38] grow none of the purposes of the
[8:40] fivefold ministry in ephesians
[8:42] is that we might all grow into the head
[8:44] which is christ
[8:46] so in no time do we grow into the
[8:48] message
[8:49] we get the revelation that this is true
[8:52] understand malachi 4 move in
[8:54] and then we hit a plateau and we plateau
[8:56] all the way across
[8:58] until magic fairy dust sprinkles down
[9:00] from heaven and then we get a body
[9:01] change
[9:02] that's not going to be the way it is
[9:04] friends remember they're coming to the
[9:06] pinnacle this is a pyramid we're growing
[9:09] into rapturing grace the the rapturing
[9:11] faith the faith you have today should be
[9:14] far outshine the faith you had two years
[9:16] ago
[9:17] if we're looking back and saying ah when
[9:19] i first came to the message so many
[9:21] things
[9:22] happened in supernatural time and 10
[9:24] years ago
[9:25] i can tell you god was real and god was
[9:27] moving 10 years ago brother banham said
[9:29] if that's where your testimony is you're
[9:31] backslidden
[9:32] because you should have a testimony of
[9:34] what god's doing now today
[9:36] growing in grace and knowledge of jesus
[9:38] christ amen growing up into the head it
[9:41] should be producing more faith
[9:42] and more faith and more faith as he
[9:45] unwinds the bible
[9:47] amen we're never taught to coast along
[9:51] and just drift waiting for a rapture
[9:54] you'll never make it
[9:56] this word should be bringing you up
[9:58] higher
[9:59] and up higher and up higher if we see
[10:03] year after year
[10:04] there's more compromise in our life less
[10:06] sincerity
[10:07] less consecration than you've been duped
[10:10] by the antichrist
[10:12] and it's time to come back and
[10:13] repentance and say god bring me back to
[10:15] my first love
[10:18] amen praise god
[10:22] brother
[10:26] brother branham says in the second seal
[10:30] second seal paragraph 137
[10:35] and i'll give you a page number here
[10:38] page number 175
[10:40] in the seal book that i have
[10:44] second seal page 175 paragraph 137
[10:48] you can't make them scriptures lie
[10:50] they're going to be truthful always
[10:52] the only thing don't try to line your
[10:55] thought or the scripture
[10:56] up to your thought but line yourself
[11:00] up with the scriptures boy i'm telling
[11:03] you that's where
[11:04] that's where he's settled that's where
[11:06] he moves in
[11:08] and starts to work in reasoning and
[11:10] logic and
[11:11] intellect and start taking the the word
[11:14] and begin to compromise it
[11:15] because you know what everybody else
[11:17] believes it this way and all around me
[11:19] it's this way
[11:20] and it's been this way for the last 30
[11:22] years and the message and
[11:23] this pastor allows it and that church
[11:25] allows it and my mom and dad
[11:27] and all this other stuff all that is is
[11:29] tainting the word in our minds
[11:31] we got to take the minds the way the
[11:33] word the way the prophet showed it to us
[11:35] the way he taught it to us
[11:36] the way the word is written and let that
[11:38] let
[11:39] our let our lives match up to that
[11:44] and not making the scriptures line up to
[11:46] what's been for the last 30 years
[11:48] or what my experience has always been or
[11:50] my understanding or what everybody else
[11:51] believes
[11:52] forget that take what the prophet has
[11:55] told us and take the word
[11:57] amen the illumination of the word on the
[12:00] scriptures and then make your life match
[12:02] that
[12:05] but line yourself up with the scriptures
[12:07] that's
[12:08] that's then you're running with god no
[12:10] matter how much you have to cut away or
[12:11] lay aside
[12:12] line up with that i say lord give me
[12:16] some grace
[12:17] that's what we want lord that's what we
[12:20] want
[12:21] so we see here we've got the the four
[12:24] the four beasts the four living
[12:26] creatures around the throne
[12:28] and i want you to notice and brother
[12:30] bran points this out over and over again
[12:32] notice the correlation between these
[12:34] living creatures
[12:35] and the throne of god because you'll
[12:37] find that these living creatures or
[12:39] these anointings or these powers
[12:41] are always around the throne
[12:44] amen they're always associated with the
[12:47] throne of god
[12:48] and they're always around the throne and
[12:51] so we know that these
[12:52] these are the powers by which he's going
[12:55] to combat
[12:56] uh the devil the antichrist spirit
[13:00] now we've got this quote we've used it
[13:01] several times now when we go to breaking
[13:03] these seals
[13:04] you're going to see it goes plumbed back
[13:06] in the scripture all the way back
[13:07] for each one of these seals the whole
[13:09] thing together the whole mystery lays
[13:11] right here in these seals see
[13:13] every mystery of the bible lays in these
[13:15] seals and the seals cannot be broken
[13:17] until that time
[13:19] so praise the lord so now we know that
[13:22] the seals have been open
[13:24] rapturing grace has come we're saying
[13:27] lord give us a revelation
[13:29] i want to stop for a minute because
[13:30] usually i get going so fast i forget
[13:32] my name and where i live and everything
[13:34] else when i get up here
[13:36] but i just want to mention this this
[13:37] image here if you see this
[13:39] image you start back here and see this
[13:42] image here
[13:44] you've probably never seen this image
[13:45] anywhere before but this is
[13:47] a description this is drawn based off a
[13:49] description
[13:50] of what brother branham describes in the
[13:52] seals of what they look like one was
[13:54] wrapped around and the end stuck out and
[13:56] a seal put on the end
[13:57] then another one wrapped around that and
[13:58] then seal put on the end and another one
[14:00] wrapped around that
[14:01] and he says you would have to open a
[14:02] seal and unwind it and then open the
[14:04] next one and unwind it
[14:06] and so these were not found on the
[14:09] internet
[14:11] this is this is artwork that was done by
[14:13] a brother in poland named brother joel
[14:16] and and he's been helping us on some of
[14:18] our stuff we're working on the studio he
[14:19] works closely with brother franco
[14:21] and all we did was send him the quotes
[14:23] of brother branham what we wanted and he
[14:24] drew this image for us
[14:28] and then he drew this image for us i
[14:31] just want to say thank you that was
[14:32] wonderful
[14:34] i also want to give a special thank you
[14:35] to brother franco because i forget every
[14:37] time
[14:37] but i did not build this powerpoint
[14:39] myself
[14:41] so if you're sitting there thinking wow
[14:42] that's nice it's easy to see i had very
[14:45] little to do with it
[14:47] in fact anything that doesn't work on
[14:48] the powerpoint now is because i've
[14:50] changed it around
[14:51] it was perfect when i got it so we
[14:54] appreciate brother franco and all that
[14:55] he does
[14:57] so we found out that there's two vines
[14:59] and only two
[15:00] two spirits and only two and we're
[15:02] dealing with two vines
[15:03] two spirits and we're dealing for with
[15:05] war that started in heaven and came down
[15:07] to earth
[15:08] all right one vine began by disbelieving
[15:11] the word
[15:12] one vine began by deceiving
[15:15] and it's going to end at some point and
[15:18] forever be abolished and there's going
[15:20] to be on this earth one
[15:21] vine and only one vine and so the
[15:24] the warfare that we're in is warfare
[15:27] between the two vines
[15:28] and you're on one or the other you're
[15:30] not in the middle amen you're on one or
[15:32] the other
[15:33] there's no gray area there's no
[15:34] switzerland in this battle
[15:36] amen everybody is involved and they're
[15:38] on one vine or the
[15:40] other and then that cuts pretty sharp
[15:43] but that's the word of god that's the
[15:44] way it is
[15:46] and so now we find out we wore not with
[15:48] flesh and blood but principalities
[15:50] powers and rulers in high places
[15:52] and we find out that that we're battling
[15:54] spirits not
[15:55] people and so in the in the fifth seal
[15:59] brother bram says now notice as the
[16:01] antichrist went forth on his beast of
[16:02] ministry
[16:03] god sent forth the beast to combat it
[16:05] because it's warfare
[16:07] it's the battle of the two vines now
[16:09] watch then every time the beast rode on
[16:11] his horse the antichrist rode on his
[16:13] horse on his beast
[16:14] to announce his ministry god sent his
[16:16] beast also in his own mask to announce
[16:18] his combat to it
[16:19] now the scripture says when the enemy
[16:21] comes in like a flood the spirit of god
[16:22] raises a standard against it
[16:25] and so when the enemy went out as an
[16:27] antichrist god sent
[16:28] a certain type of power to meet him and
[16:30] he went out again as a red horse rider
[16:32] another color another power another
[16:34] ministry
[16:35] god sent another one after him to combat
[16:37] it to hold his church
[16:39] sent the third one again and sent the
[16:41] his third beast come and announced it he
[16:43] sent the fourth one
[16:44] so god has not left the church without a
[16:46] defense but god has sent a defense and
[16:48] he's been
[16:49] a battle plan for the church so you find
[16:52] there's a path of the antichrist but
[16:54] there's also a path of christ
[16:56] and so when the enemy comes in like a
[16:58] flood god will raise something against
[17:00] it
[17:01] all right and we want to find out what
[17:03] is raised against it and how do we
[17:05] fight this antichrist now now there was
[17:08] a quote
[17:09] that that i didn't read sunday i'd like
[17:11] to read to from the first seal
[17:13] and he says the white horse rider went
[17:15] out who is he he's mighty and his
[17:17] conquering power
[17:19] is a great fellow in his conquering
[17:21] power
[17:22] amen and he says you want me to tell you
[17:25] who he is he's the antichrist that's
[17:27] exactly what he is
[17:28] because you see jesus said that the two
[17:31] would be so close together until it
[17:32] would deceive the very elect
[17:33] the bride if it was possible so we find
[17:36] out that the y horse rider is the
[17:37] antichrist spirit that's not new to us
[17:39] we understood that
[17:40] but what is amazing is we learned that
[17:43] it was deception
[17:44] a subtle change from the word something
[17:47] slightly different right
[17:49] and we found out that he he's he is he's
[17:52] a
[17:53] mighty conqueror and he came forth
[17:56] to conquer so the white horse rider
[17:59] and on the white horse beast came to
[18:02] conquer
[18:03] conquering and to conquer but remember
[18:06] he comes with no crown
[18:07] and he comes with no arrows he has no
[18:10] authority over you and he cannot harm
[18:12] you amen
[18:13] but he come as a mighty conqueror with
[18:16] mighty conquering power
[18:18] so you have to understand it looks so
[18:21] innocent
[18:22] it looks so harmless but he is a
[18:26] mighty conqueror in the white horse face
[18:32] when he begins as a very
[18:35] very slight deviation from truth
[18:38] and looks white and looks innocent and
[18:41] looks harmless
[18:42] like it possibly can't harm you amen
[18:45] he's beginning to conquer
[18:48] as soon as you accept that as soon as
[18:50] you accept anything other than the pure
[18:52] revealed word
[18:54] any deviation from the pure revealed
[18:57] word of the hour
[18:58] this the minute you in your mind begin
[19:01] to accept something other than that
[19:03] now he's beginning to conquer your life
[19:07] because he's a mighty conqueror with
[19:09] mighty conquering power
[19:11] but he looks innocent harmless
[19:14] and not able to hurt you and he's got no
[19:16] authority over you
[19:18] so we can't play around with the white
[19:20] horse
[19:22] you can't tease around you can't try it
[19:25] out for a while
[19:26] you can't take a few steps down this
[19:28] road to feel it out and you can always
[19:30] come back
[19:30] you'll have you so far down the road you
[19:32] won't realize what happened to you when
[19:34] you wake up
[19:36] no deviation whatsoever from the
[19:39] revealed word of the hour
[19:41] that's the heart cry of the brine so we
[19:44] find out that the
[19:45] the plan here is he's going to ride now
[19:48] i want to just point out a few things
[19:50] uh there's there's definitely some
[19:51] things i want to get to here but but i
[19:53] want to point out a few things as we go
[19:55] now he comes on a white horse but satan
[19:58] has
[19:58] never desired to ride a white horse in
[20:02] your life
[20:04] he doesn't want to ride a white horse
[20:06] because if he wanted to ride a white
[20:07] horse he would have wrote it all down
[20:09] through the church ages
[20:10] but it wasn't the white horse that he
[20:11] wants to ride he wants to ride the pale
[20:14] horse
[20:16] but he's he's crafty right he's cunning
[20:19] amen and so what he knows he knows
[20:21] you'll never fall for spiritual death
[20:23] you'll never fall for eternal separation
[20:25] from god so he's got to come in
[20:28] with ever so slight a deviation
[20:30] something that looks very good very
[20:31] reasonable
[20:32] harmless and then he begins to deride on
[20:36] that until you put a crown on his head
[20:38] because who crowned the white horse
[20:40] rider it was the church that crowned him
[20:43] so you put a crown on his head and when
[20:45] you do he changes horses
[20:48] same rider new horse he moves to a red
[20:50] horse
[20:52] because he didn't want to ride the white
[20:53] horse anyways he's not sad that he's
[20:55] leaving it behind and moving on
[20:57] the plan is working perfect then he
[21:00] rides the white horse or the red horse
[21:02] for a while but the red horse is not his
[21:04] horse of destination
[21:05] he wants to get off the red horse as
[21:07] quickly as he can
[21:08] and he wants to get onto the black horse
[21:11] why because all these three powers wound
[21:13] up into one
[21:14] is where he wants to be and he wants to
[21:16] be in the pale horse
[21:20] which is spiritual death eternal
[21:22] separation from god
[21:24] don't forget he's a mighty conqueror but
[21:27] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[21:30] god raises a standard against it
[21:33] he sent these beasts to combat these
[21:36] antichrist riders
[21:38] so you have to know where you are and
[21:40] what god sent
[21:42] and you know how to fight
[21:45] now we see the devil changes four beasts
[21:47] meant what power that he
[21:49] he was revealed what power he revealed
[21:50] to the world and how they ended on this
[21:52] pale horse
[21:53] let's look at the powers of the beast to
[21:56] combat them
[21:57] and i want to back way up to look at
[22:00] these powers
[22:01] let's go to genesis chapter 3.
[22:05] i love how brother branham says
[22:06] everything begins in genesis and it
[22:09] winds up in revelation
[22:10] two books of the bible that the devil
[22:12] hates one that shows his origin and the
[22:14] other one that shows his defeat
[22:17] but you know what two books of the bible
[22:19] we love
[22:20] the book of revelation in the book of
[22:23] genesis
[22:25] so genesis chapter 3 verse 24 this is
[22:28] after the fall
[22:28] after the judgment of man and it says in
[22:31] verse 24 so he
[22:32] drove out the man and he placed at the
[22:35] east of the garden of eden cherubims
[22:37] and a flaming sword which turned every
[22:39] way to keep the way
[22:41] of the tree of life so this is the first
[22:44] mention of these four beasts
[22:47] we find them right here and we're going
[22:49] to read where brother bram talks about
[22:50] this
[22:51] but as soon as man falls and he's judged
[22:54] now he's put
[22:55] outside of eden and in the east side of
[22:58] eden he put
[22:59] cherubims with a flaming sword to keep
[23:02] the way
[23:02] of the tree of life now that's
[23:04] interesting wording that he says to keep
[23:06] the way
[23:07] of the tree of life he didn't say to
[23:09] keep them away from the tree of life
[23:12] but to keep the way of the tree of life
[23:15] and so we find that these beasts are
[23:17] going to serve a dual function
[23:19] amen they are to keep the way so they're
[23:22] to keep the way pure
[23:24] they're to keep the way unspotted
[23:26] they're to keep the way uncluttered
[23:28] so nothing that can defile is allowed to
[23:30] come into the presence of god
[23:32] but also they keep the way so that when
[23:35] the conditions are right and the
[23:36] conditions are met
[23:37] those who come under the right
[23:39] conditions now can approach
[23:40] back to the east gate eastern gate of
[23:43] eden
[23:45] and we've approached back to the eastern
[23:47] gate of eden
[23:49] hallelujah brother branham says in
[23:52] revelation chapter 4 from 1961
[23:55] he said the lord sent forth from the
[23:58] garden of eden
[23:59] to till the ground from whence he was
[24:00] taken so he drove out the man and he
[24:03] placed at the east of the garden of eden
[24:04] cherubims and a flaming sword a flying
[24:07] flaming sword
[24:08] which turns every way see the four
[24:10] beasts
[24:11] there's only four ways you can go east
[24:13] north west and south
[24:15] these cherubims had a flaming sword at
[24:17] the gate of the garden to keep the way
[24:19] of the tree of life
[24:20] because if ever if man ever got a hold
[24:22] of the tree of life
[24:23] then he he could live forever and these
[24:26] cherubims first mentioned was placed at
[24:28] the east gate of the garden going four
[24:30] ways
[24:32] i should have made that a little
[24:33] different he's drawing up on a
[24:34] chalkboard now he should have made that
[24:35] a little different from that
[24:37] i can't do it justly to god's orders and
[24:39] things so
[24:40] that you'll know what i mean there's the
[24:42] garden of eden
[24:43] and this is the gate right there opens
[24:46] up here swings out
[24:47] and at this gate there was cherubims how
[24:49] many would love to see what he's drawing
[24:52] oh my gate swings out and there's
[24:55] cherubims cherubims and remember it
[24:57] doesn't say
[24:58] cherubim it says cherubims cherubim's
[25:01] was placed there to guard what the tree
[25:04] of life
[25:05] that's what they was to guard the way of
[25:08] the tree of life now remember
[25:10] they're guarding or keeping to keep
[25:12] means to guard
[25:13] so if you if you if they bring you into
[25:15] prison they bring you into a keep
[25:18] they guard you so to keep the way of the
[25:20] tree of life is to guard the way of the
[25:22] tree of life
[25:24] the way who is the way jesus where is it
[25:27] reflecting from
[25:28] here is the holy place here are the
[25:30] cherubims you notice i jumped a little
[25:32] further down you notice these cherubims
[25:34] that john saw
[25:36] here must have been interested in
[25:38] keeping the tree of life
[25:40] they must be interested in human beings
[25:42] or read genesis getting back to genesis
[25:44] again they kept the tree of life
[25:46] guarded it the way of life the way of
[25:49] life how was the way
[25:50] jesus said i am that way i am that bread
[25:53] that come from god out of heaven
[25:55] if a man eats this bread he'll live
[25:57] forever now there is a way back to that
[25:59] tree of life you get it
[26:01] now at this i want to show now and make
[26:04] this shirt
[26:04] it's an altar this must have been an
[26:08] altar at the garden of eden i'll tell
[26:11] you why
[26:12] do you remember both cain and abel come
[26:14] up here to worship so they shows that
[26:16] god's altar was
[26:17] moved and set here at the garden of eden
[26:20] and the only way back to eden is by the
[26:23] altar
[26:24] here you are again see back to eden
[26:26] through the altar
[26:28] and they were kept that way there
[26:31] guarded
[26:31] that they couldn't get back there until
[26:34] this altar was covered with blood
[26:37] remember they're keeping the way of the
[26:40] tree of life
[26:42] and if they're keeping the way the
[26:44] guarding the way of the tree of life
[26:46] then these four powers or these four
[26:48] anointings are essential
[26:51] to finding the way back to the tree of
[26:53] life
[26:54] they're critical to coming back to the
[26:56] tree of life
[26:59] he said oh god can't people see it
[27:03] nothing but the blood there has to be an
[27:06] atonement a mercy seat there
[27:08] this altar of judgment must become a
[27:10] mercy seat
[27:11] and when this altar if the blood is
[27:12] lifted they will stand at that judgment
[27:14] day the fire of god's wrath to guard
[27:16] that tree again
[27:18] only one thing will enter in into this
[27:21] gate to eden again
[27:22] will be through the blood of jesus
[27:23] christ you see it now notice
[27:27] there's cain and here's abel all right
[27:30] now both boys come up to this gate to
[27:32] worship is that right
[27:34] so it must have been god's altar is that
[27:36] right and before this altar they built
[27:38] substitutionary another altar
[27:40] here's the true altar of god is in the
[27:43] heart of man
[27:46] so now he's saying that that
[27:49] after the sin and after judgment they
[27:51] were moved
[27:52] out and now there's an altar of god
[27:54] placed on the east side of eden
[27:56] and man wants to go back into eden where
[27:58] the tree of life is
[28:01] but he can't go in to eat until he
[28:02] crosses this altar this altar is a
[28:04] judgment now
[28:06] and the in the in the and the beasts are
[28:08] acting as judges
[28:09] get in there they're around the judgment
[28:12] seat keeping people away from the tree
[28:14] of life
[28:15] until blood makes this judgment seat a
[28:17] mercy seat
[28:20] and when blood comes upon it it's a
[28:22] mercy seat and now
[28:24] now what was keeping them away brother
[28:26] branham said now
[28:28] is driving them back into the tree of
[28:30] life
[28:31] so the four beasts who are saying you
[28:34] can't come you can't come
[28:35] you can't come because there's no blood
[28:37] as soon as their blood they're saying
[28:39] come come come come
[28:43] now these are now these are the four
[28:45] beasts that are combating the antichrist
[28:47] spirit so you got to keep that in your
[28:48] mind
[28:48] now brother brahm talks all about these
[28:50] altars then he says the true altar
[28:52] is in the heart of man
[28:56] now these four beasts are there so if
[28:59] the true altar is on the heart of man
[29:02] but there's no blood yet on that altar
[29:04] then that's a judgment seat
[29:08] in your own heart if there's no blood
[29:11] there
[29:11] it's a judgment seat and as long as
[29:14] there's no blood there
[29:15] the beasts are keeping you away from the
[29:17] tree of life keeping you away from the
[29:19] tree of life
[29:19] keeping you away from the tree of life
[29:21] but the moment there's now
[29:23] blood on the altar of your heart and now
[29:25] it's not a judgment seat it becomes a
[29:27] mercy seat
[29:28] they're saying come come come you meet
[29:31] the conditions come to the tree of life
[29:34] who's who's doing it who's guarding the
[29:36] way the four
[29:37] beasts they have been since
[29:40] the fall brother branham said these
[29:43] seals unlock the mystery of the entire
[29:46] bible genesis 3 4 beast
[29:50] amen ezekiel 4 beast
[29:53] four beasts revelations four beasts
[29:57] praise god what are they doing they have
[30:00] something to do with the throne of god
[30:02] guarding the shekinah glory of god and
[30:04] they have something to do with judgment
[30:07] so let's keep looking
[30:13] all right now we're getting into so much
[30:17] subject matter that i just want to go
[30:19] slow and let it be absorbed i'm trying
[30:20] to take bite-sized pieces
[30:22] but every bite is a mouthful friends
[30:25] every bite we take is like oh wow i
[30:28] could chew on that for a week
[30:30] but i just want to get to a few things
[30:32] now
[30:33] now we look at the the tabernacle in the
[30:36] wilderness and
[30:37] we've got this this picture here showing
[30:39] that the
[30:40] israelite camp was a huge camp that
[30:42] surrounded
[30:43] the this uh this tabernacle in the
[30:46] wilderness
[30:47] and in this tabernacle god said that his
[30:49] shekinah glory would be there his
[30:50] presence would be there
[30:52] sitting on the altar or on the throne
[30:55] amen and when
[30:56] when when when he was on that throne his
[30:58] presence was among the people
[31:00] and we find this is this is just a
[31:03] picture of that old testament tabernacle
[31:05] with the shekinah glory of god coming
[31:06] down
[31:07] but but around the encampment of israel
[31:10] were camped the tribes
[31:12] and the tribes were camped in a certain
[31:13] order and each tribe had a banner that
[31:16] represented their tribe and on those
[31:18] banners were different
[31:19] animals and different symbols and those
[31:21] symbols had something to do with that
[31:23] tribe
[31:24] so we find the encampment around
[31:27] a roundness and we won't go into it
[31:28] we've been into it before
[31:30] but we find you have the standard of the
[31:32] lion the tribe of judah
[31:34] of the ox of ephraim you have a
[31:38] reuben the man and you have dan
[31:41] the the eagle so you find
[31:44] that god is showing this all the way
[31:47] through the scriptures
[31:48] now when they come and there's a place
[31:50] for his throne there's a place for his
[31:52] mercy seat on earth
[31:53] then he must put around that mercy seat
[31:56] he must put the throne guards
[31:58] he must put the four beasts amen so
[32:01] everywhere that god
[32:03] is the four beasts are around god around
[32:05] his throne they have to be their friends
[32:07] and so now he moses is sitting the
[32:10] tribes in a certain order
[32:12] dan you camp here judah you camp here
[32:14] and ephraim you camped there
[32:16] and and and and all of these you camp
[32:18] ruben you camp where i tell you to camp
[32:20] and when they would raise up their
[32:22] standard and they would stake it in the
[32:23] ground
[32:23] you would see around the tabernacle in
[32:26] the wilderness the lion the ox the man
[32:28] and the eagle
[32:29] and they were there for a reason
[32:33] and the prophet of god tells us now we
[32:35] find out that they were the guards to
[32:37] the mercy seat
[32:38] they watched the mercy seat nothing come
[32:40] to it crossed over the tribes that first
[32:42] before it get to the mercy seat
[32:44] every man willing to give his life every
[32:47] israelite in the camp would die before
[32:49] anything could enter into the camp
[32:51] over there and take that mercy seat and
[32:53] now we find out that was the old
[32:55] testament order
[32:56] now see now israel becomes the guard to
[32:59] the mercy seat
[33:01] israel themselves becomes the guard so
[33:04] if enemy any enemy wants to come
[33:06] in because they represent the four
[33:08] beasts
[33:09] because they're a camp north south east
[33:11] and west as lions man and eagle
[33:13] now their purpose is to keep the way to
[33:16] the tree of life
[33:17] keep the way to the throne of god keep
[33:19] the way to the mercy seat
[33:21] now if any hittite or jebusite or
[33:23] anything else would come along
[33:25] and try to battle their way in every man
[33:27] to a man would give his life to keep
[33:29] them from the mercy seat
[33:31] why because they don't come in the right
[33:32] condition they don't come with the right
[33:34] blood they don't come with the right
[33:35] offering
[33:36] they're not pure seed of god they're not
[33:38] the chosen they're not the elect
[33:39] they're not true israelites they're not
[33:41] coming by the way of the priesthood
[33:43] they're not coming by the way of the
[33:44] blood so they
[33:45] can't come to the mercy seat so to a man
[33:49] they would sacrifice their life to keep
[33:50] them from that
[33:52] but but they were set in camp
[33:55] they were set in battle array they were
[33:57] there guarding the throne
[33:59] and nothing could come to it unless you
[34:02] were chosen elect of god coming the
[34:04] right way
[34:05] and if you were chosen elective god of
[34:08] the tribe of israel
[34:09] and you were coming with a sacrifice in
[34:11] your arms that you were going to offer
[34:12] through the proper channel
[34:14] through the proper priesthood they kept
[34:16] the path clear they kept it open they
[34:18] kept you safe they kept you protected
[34:20] all the way until your blood could be
[34:22] offered on the altar of sacrifice
[34:24] and you could you could have a
[34:26] substitutionary offering atoning for
[34:28] your sins
[34:30] it had everything to do with who you
[34:32] were and how you were approaching
[34:35] if you were the wrong seed you were and
[34:38] you come the wrong way
[34:39] they would slay you dead but if you were
[34:42] the right seed coming the right way
[34:44] they would keep you safe and protected
[34:46] and nothing would stop you from getting
[34:48] to the mercy seat
[34:50] now when you see your position you see
[34:52] the position of the four beasts
[34:53] now you know who is it who is it that's
[34:55] keeping the way to the tree of life
[34:57] who is it that's driving you into the
[34:59] tree of life keeping you safe and
[35:01] protected and guarding your way
[35:02] all the way back till you come in
[35:04] contact with the tree of life it's these
[35:06] four anointings which is nothing but the
[35:08] ministry of christ
[35:10] hallelujah christ is a lion christ as an
[35:13] ox christ is a man
[35:14] christ as an eagle keeping you
[35:17] driving you protecting you all the way
[35:20] back
[35:21] when you come with no blood on the altar
[35:24] of your heart
[35:24] keep you away when you have blood on the
[35:27] altar of your heart
[35:28] they're ushering you in hallelujah
[35:32] and in the new testament or we find the
[35:34] same thing that was guarded the mercy
[35:36] seat
[35:36] oh i hope you get it the mercy seat is
[35:38] still guarded still got the guards
[35:40] we found out that those guards are
[35:42] matthew mark luke and john
[35:44] guarding the book of acts the acts of
[35:47] the holy spirit
[35:48] among the apostles which is the book of
[35:50] acts of the new
[35:51] new testament and the four writers of
[35:54] the gospel matthew mark luke and john
[35:56] all guarded that mercy seat to show that
[35:58] it is god the holy spirit today
[36:02] each scripture matthew mark luke and
[36:04] john every one of them will be back up
[36:06] the true gospel of the lord jesus christ
[36:08] and the acts of the holy spirit
[36:10] so now we're coming to the book of acts
[36:13] but you cannot get to the book of acts
[36:15] because what is the book of acts the
[36:17] book of acts is the shekinah glory of
[36:19] god
[36:19] coming to another throne
[36:23] wherever god puts his throne and
[36:25] wherever his presence come
[36:27] you have to have the four beasts because
[36:30] in the temple
[36:31] if it's at the altar at the east side of
[36:33] eden they've got to be there
[36:35] amen if it's in the tabernacle in the
[36:37] wilderness they have to be there
[36:38] amen if it's in the new testament church
[36:40] it has to be there
[36:43] hallelujah so brother branham is telling
[36:46] us
[36:46] that there's guards guarding the way to
[36:48] what to the presence of god the mercy
[36:51] seat
[36:52] and how do you come you can only come
[36:55] now
[36:56] before you could come with a lamb
[36:59] with a dove with a goat with an oxen
[37:02] whatever that was required for why you
[37:04] were approaching
[37:05] you could approach unto god according to
[37:07] his way but something
[37:08] changed when jesus christ came and the
[37:11] gospels tell the story of the transition
[37:14] and now the only way to come to the
[37:16] throne of god to the mercy seat to the
[37:18] personal presence of god himself
[37:20] is to come through the gospels
[37:23] and the gospels keep the way to the tree
[37:26] of life
[37:26] amen in the gospels guard the way to the
[37:29] tree of life
[37:30] because the gospels tell you the story
[37:33] and ministry and life of jesus christ
[37:36] so what do they do they drive you to the
[37:39] tree of life
[37:41] they keep you away if you don't come the
[37:44] gospel way
[37:46] but if you come the gospel way then they
[37:48] usher you into the presence
[37:50] of god because those gospels tell you
[37:52] exactly what jesus christ did when he
[37:54] was on earth
[37:55] how he acted what his character was what
[37:57] he did his works
[37:59] his life they tell you all of that so
[38:01] now when you get to the book of acts
[38:03] all the book of acts is is a replica of
[38:06] the life of jesus christ
[38:08] and in many member body so the gospels
[38:10] telling the story of jesus christ
[38:12] bring you to the life of jesus christ
[38:15] sitting on the throne of a human heart
[38:17] acting the same way he always acted
[38:21] brother branham said if if you have the
[38:23] spirit of beethoven in you right now
[38:26] what will you do compose music
[38:29] if you have the spirit of diliger in you
[38:31] right now what will you do
[38:32] you'll rob banks but if you have the
[38:34] spirit of jesus christ in you
[38:37] what will you do you'll do what you saw
[38:39] in the four gospels
[38:41] and what was seen in the four gospels
[38:43] was played out again in a mini-member
[38:45] bride and a body in the book of acts
[38:48] hallelujah what was it it was a
[38:51] transition
[38:52] from the temple amen built
[38:55] built by solomon restored by herod it
[38:58] was moving from the temple
[39:00] from the old way over into the hearts of
[39:03] men
[39:04] and now you have to have four guards
[39:08] it's amazing if you look up amen if you
[39:10] look up old bibles and old pictures of
[39:13] matthew mark luke and john
[39:14] over matthew the book of matthew will be
[39:16] a lion
[39:19] amen mark will be a ox amen
[39:22] luke will be a man amen the old church
[39:25] amen the original church and the 19
[39:27] fathers and three 19 fathers they knew
[39:29] this to be true
[39:31] they knew matthew mark luke and john was
[39:33] the lion the ox the man and the eagle
[39:35] and if you look at ancient documents you
[39:37] can find those same images
[39:40] now brother brahm didn't come to bring
[39:42] new he came to restore back
[39:45] to what the first fathers already knew
[39:48] that this is the way to the tree of life
[39:50] these gospels are the path to the tree
[39:52] of life it is the display of the tree of
[39:55] life
[39:58] and if god ever puts out another branch
[40:00] they'll write another
[40:03] and if there's another book of acts
[40:04] being written there then there has to be
[40:06] four throne guards around the bride
[40:10] hallelujah amen
[40:14] god is good so now guarding the presence
[40:18] of god the throne of god the shekinah
[40:20] glory of god
[40:21] is matthew mark luke and john
[40:27] revelation chapter 4 just exactly the
[40:30] tribes of israel camped around
[40:31] guarding their earthly guards of the
[40:34] right to the ark now what are they
[40:35] regarding
[40:36] the right to the ark
[40:40] they're not just guarding the ark
[40:42] they're guarding the right
[40:44] to the ark because if you were israelite
[40:48] pure in blood and you came the right
[40:52] way you had a right to the ark
[40:56] if you weren't you didn't have a right
[40:58] they were guarding
[41:00] they were earthly guards of the right to
[41:01] the ark
[41:03] mercy seat mercy seat nothing could come
[41:05] anywhere around it without crossing
[41:07] those tribes crossing one
[41:09] the lion crossing the man the
[41:10] intelligence of man crossing the
[41:12] workhorse
[41:12] as an ox or crossing the eagle the swiss
[41:15] swiftness of it
[41:16] the heaven the earth in between and all
[41:18] around you see they were guards
[41:20] and above it was the pillar of fire
[41:22] brother nothing touched that mercy seat
[41:24] without the approach
[41:25] and the only thing that could approach
[41:27] it was through
[41:28] the blood
[41:31] right they regarding that that
[41:35] that altar on the east side of eden and
[41:38] nothing could cross
[41:39] back into eden to the tree of life until
[41:41] there was blood on that altar
[41:44] there was a flaming sword turning every
[41:46] which way and they could not
[41:48] come back until the blood was on the
[41:50] altar
[41:51] but after the blood came on the altar
[41:53] now you see the temple guards moving
[41:55] to the throne and where is the throne
[41:57] the throne is in the people
[41:59] by the baptism of the holy ghost now
[42:03] this is so important we're going to make
[42:06] a transition watch it close
[42:08] the only thing that could approach it
[42:10] was through the blood
[42:12] can't approach there's four powers four
[42:15] anointings four beasts
[42:16] to keep you from the tree of life if you
[42:18] don't have blood
[42:19] but when you have blood they're there to
[42:22] keep the way open to the tree of life
[42:24] brother branham said one time they were
[42:26] driving you away now they're driving you
[42:28] back to the tree of life
[42:31] so around the throne of god amen the
[42:34] mercy seat are these four beasts
[42:36] he said now the the message the token
[42:38] which i asked you to listen to i hope
[42:39] some of you got a chance to
[42:41] the new testament means new covenant the
[42:44] blood life the blood life itself
[42:46] is the token now get that the blood life
[42:49] itself
[42:50] is the token the life out of the blood
[42:52] is the token remember the old testament
[42:54] the actual blood of the lamb had to be
[42:56] applied
[42:57] here it's the token of the blood
[43:01] it is the life from the blood that's in
[43:04] the person
[43:05] for the token
[43:08] hallelujah let's look at let's look at
[43:11] this again
[43:13] now look just to believe it is not
[43:16] enough
[43:18] to walk around where it's at isn't
[43:20] enough see
[43:21] that's to make yourself worse for he
[43:24] that knoweth to do good and doeth it not
[43:26] to him
[43:26] it's sin those borderline believers
[43:29] jesus spoke of them the same thing
[43:31] hebrews the sixth chapter for it is
[43:32] impossible for those
[43:33] who were once enlightened and have been
[43:35] made partakers of the holy spirit have
[43:36] tasted of the good word of god
[43:38] and the world to come if they shall fall
[43:40] away to renew themselves again to
[43:42] repentance seeing that they crucified to
[43:44] themselves
[43:44] the son of god and count the covenant of
[43:46] the blood wherewith they they were
[43:48] sanctified
[43:49] now get what he's getting ray say the
[43:51] chemistry there sanctifies
[43:53] it ain't the token the blood
[43:56] is not the token now
[44:00] the life is the token
[44:04] so he's referring back amen to the
[44:06] passover to where there had to be a
[44:08] token or there would be death and it was
[44:10] the blood of a substitute and that
[44:12] substitute had to be visually applied
[44:15] this is this is the the part that is so
[44:18] super critical
[44:19] it had to be he said on display
[44:23] you couldn't be ashamed of it you
[44:24] couldn't come halfway to it
[44:26] he said you couldn't kill the lamb and
[44:28] have blood in the bucket that would do
[44:30] you no good
[44:30] you couldn't just splattered around the
[44:32] ground you had to do exactly what the
[44:34] prophet told you to do and the prophet
[44:36] told you to take
[44:37] his sip and dip it in the bucket and
[44:39] strike it on the lid on the doorpost and
[44:41] you had to do it exactly the way he said
[44:43] and it had to be applied so to kill the
[44:46] lamb wasn't enough
[44:47] to collect his blood wasn't enough to
[44:49] have it in your possession
[44:50] wasn't enough but to avoid
[44:54] death you had to be applied
[44:58] oh this is so super important this is
[45:00] the whole message of the token
[45:02] he's saying it's not enough just to say
[45:04] you believe it it's not enough to come
[45:06] to church and associate with it
[45:07] it's not enough brother braham said you
[45:09] say brother branham i agree with every
[45:10] bit of it he said that's good but that's
[45:12] not
[45:13] it yet he said you've got to take it
[45:17] take it into yourself become one with it
[45:20] and then
[45:20] let it change your entire life until the
[45:23] token which
[45:23] is not the blood of jesus christ it's
[45:26] the life of the blood of jesus christ
[45:28] and the life that was in that blood when
[45:30] he was walking the sea of galilee when
[45:32] he was walking in nazareth in capernaum
[45:34] and jerusalem
[45:35] that life that was in him then that life
[45:38] has to be in you now
[45:39] but it can't be in a bucket by the door
[45:42] it's got to be on display it's got to be
[45:46] so that
[45:47] everyone passing by can see the blood
[45:50] it's not questionable it's not it's not
[45:53] confusing
[45:54] it's either on or it's off
[45:57] amen in the days of the passover it
[45:59] wasn't a question mark it wasn't
[46:01] there's a dark spot there on the lymph i
[46:03] can't tell could that be blood
[46:04] it may not be blood if that that's not
[46:07] the right kind of application
[46:09] that's not what moses said moses wanted
[46:11] it clearly
[46:12] blood red splashed all over the door all
[46:15] over the lentil all over down
[46:17] so everyone could see that we've
[46:20] accepted the sacrifice
[46:23] you can't be walking by your neighbor
[46:25] and wondering did they put it on did
[46:26] they not put it on i can't
[46:28] see it if i get my microscope out
[46:31] can i see a little blood here or a
[46:33] little bit there you can't say well
[46:34] let's apply it
[46:35] faintly
[46:36] [Laughter]
[46:38] it's got to be on display for everyone
[46:40] to see
[46:42] you shouldn't be walking around as a
[46:43] believer and people wondering whether or
[46:45] not you're a believer
[46:46] wondering whether or not you're sold out
[46:48] to jesus christ you've given your life
[46:50] as a total sacrifice
[46:51] they shouldn't be saying maybe he is
[46:52] maybe she i'm not exactly sure maybe if
[46:54] i get a little closer maybe if i ask him
[46:56] a few questions
[46:57] it should be on display the life that
[47:00] was in the blood
[47:01] amen the life of jesus christ comes into
[47:04] you you won't write music like beethoven
[47:06] you won't write banks
[47:07] what you'll do is you'll live the life
[47:09] of the word you'll live it out
[47:11] every portion of it you'll sacrifice
[47:13] yourself you'll lay down your life
[47:15] you'll say i don't want what i want i
[47:17] want what god wants
[47:19] if the word tells me this i'll do it if
[47:22] it kills me i'll do it
[47:24] if the word tells me to pay tithe and
[47:25] give offering i'm going to do it if it's
[47:27] the last thing i got
[47:28] if they come and collect my lazy boy
[47:30] chair or they come and repossess my car
[47:33] the first is going to go to god
[47:36] until there's no mistake anymore that
[47:39] the blood is applied
[47:42] amen too many believers have been too
[47:46] long with confidence and blood in the
[47:48] bucket
[47:51] it's not blood in the bucket it's not
[47:55] saying well i have it in my heart
[47:56] if you have it in your heart it better
[47:58] be on your door
[48:00] it better be an invisible manifestation
[48:04] for all the world to see amen that
[48:07] you've accepted the atonement
[48:10] and under that condition you're ushered
[48:14] back to the tree of life
[48:20] the sixth seal if you'll remember we
[48:22] talked about the sixth seal
[48:24] several weeks ago and i'm gonna touch
[48:25] into it now
[48:27] because we realize and i realize now
[48:30] that i am
[48:30] so far away from notes and stuff but hey
[48:33] praise the lord
[48:36] amen i don't exactly know what i'm going
[48:40] to do
[48:41] praise god let's just go all right in
[48:44] the sixth seal
[48:45] we find out that the seal is the
[48:47] judgment seal
[48:49] now when we're first studying the seals
[48:50] we think all six seals have nothing to
[48:52] do with us
[48:53] it's to you know the tribulation period
[48:55] and it absolutely is the tribulation
[48:57] period
[48:57] and during that tribulation period
[48:59] there'll be a calling out of the 144
[49:01] 000 they'll be the two witnesses moses
[49:03] and elijah that preached to the jews
[49:05] calling out the 144 000 and all of that
[49:08] takes place that doesn't change anything
[49:10] in the seal
[49:10] but brother branham says this sixth seal
[49:12] is the judgment seal of the word
[49:16] because the word brings judgment
[49:20] his word is a sharp two-edged sword
[49:25] dividing amen
[49:29] the sword of the word divides
[49:32] and it cuts pretty close it can divide
[49:35] the spirit and the soul
[49:38] which you yourself can hardly divide in
[49:40] your own being
[49:42] sometimes you can't tell is this me or
[49:45] is this the lord
[49:46] amen your heart man's heart is
[49:49] deceitfully wicked who can know it
[49:51] your own your own spirit is deceiving
[49:53] you all the time your spirit's carnal of
[49:55] the world
[49:56] but the life that's in your soul by the
[49:58] baptism of the holy ghost
[49:59] that part is of god but the other part's
[50:02] not of god
[50:03] and it's so close that sometimes you
[50:04] can't discern it yourself
[50:06] but the word is what separates the word
[50:10] is what splits it right down the middle
[50:12] so you can discern what's me and what's
[50:13] god what's of the enemy and what's of
[50:15] god by what
[50:16] by the word and the word is there to
[50:19] divide
[50:20] all of that wrong nature all of that
[50:23] wrong thinking it's to cut it away
[50:25] and cut down to the soul
[50:29] the word divides so so
[50:32] what uh what i want to explain if i
[50:34] could just explain it this way
[50:37] these guards have a purpose and the
[50:39] purpose is to keep the way to the tree
[50:41] of life
[50:42] so that there's some they keep away and
[50:45] that there's some they usher in
[50:47] do we see that that's the way the
[50:48] prophet explained it so that means
[50:51] these guards are bringing us through
[50:54] judgment right because
[50:57] we have to they have to bring us through
[50:59] judgment so we know
[51:01] whether or not we're coming with the
[51:03] right approach and the right of
[51:04] condition
[51:05] of the right seed so that we can go to
[51:07] the throne of mercy so that we can go to
[51:09] the tree of life
[51:10] because if we're of the wrong seed not
[51:12] predestinated seed
[51:14] if we're of the wrong seed and come the
[51:15] wrong way with the wrong approach
[51:17] they're there to keep you away so the
[51:20] four
[51:21] beasts bring you to judgment hallelujah
[51:28] revelations chapter 3 let's turn there
[51:30] together
[51:35] my goodness there's never any time
[51:39] the word is eternal we're eternal
[51:41] creatures stuck in a time of condition
[51:43] and a condition of time i mean and we're
[51:46] becoming increasingly frustrated by it
[51:48] especially on sundays and wednesdays
[51:52] so we find out in revelations chapter 3
[51:55] verse 14 he's saying unto the angel of
[51:57] the church of the laodiceans right
[51:59] these things saith thee amen the
[52:00] faithful and true witness that beginning
[52:02] of the creation of god
[52:04] so now god's speaking to the laodicean
[52:06] church age
[52:07] then we come over here to verse 19
[52:10] he says as many as i love i rebuke and
[52:13] chasten
[52:14] be zealous therefore and repent so the
[52:18] ones that he
[52:19] loves now god
[52:22] god's love is not like you're in mind
[52:24] love it's not an emotional love it's not
[52:27] based on feeling whatsoever it's a
[52:29] perfect love
[52:30] and it's charity and god those whom he
[52:32] loves
[52:33] he rebukes and he chastens
[52:37] so that we will be zealous and repent
[52:41] so we have to come through judgment amen
[52:44] to come to the lord
[52:47] all right and we find in the church ages
[52:49] i i don't have time to go through it now
[52:51] but you read chapter 2 and chapter 3 you
[52:54] find the word repent
[52:55] shows up over and over and over and over
[52:58] and over again
[52:59] he's constantly the spirit of god is
[53:00] constantly saying repent
[53:02] repent repent repent and here in the
[53:05] seventh church age
[53:06] he changes it before it was repent
[53:08] repent repent
[53:09] now let's be zealous
[53:13] and repent this is a whole different
[53:16] layer when we come to the final stage of
[53:18] the journey for the church
[53:19] it's a whole new layer of repentance
[53:21] this is
[53:22] being zealous and repenting
[53:25] brother graham said in the legacy in
[53:26] church age but god is calling for
[53:28] another zeal
[53:30] it is the zeal to cry i am wrong
[53:34] that's what he's looking for in this
[53:36] last stage for those who are going to
[53:37] come
[53:38] out of laodicea who are going to rise
[53:40] above it they have to be zealous for
[53:42] repentance
[53:43] they have to be zealous to say i'm wrong
[53:45] not a casual i'm wrong or oh yeah i
[53:47] shouldn't have done that
[53:48] but zealous to repent not walking
[53:52] through life
[53:53] and you know so many times you find that
[53:56] that
[53:56] nobody would ever admit to doing this
[53:58] but this is the truth
[54:00] so many times we won't give our full
[54:02] self to the word of god
[54:04] because we're afraid of what we will
[54:06] uncover in our lives
[54:08] we won't give ourselves completely to
[54:10] the message of the hour
[54:12] we won't read the books listen to the
[54:13] tapes be in fellowship because we're not
[54:15] sure we can pay the price that it
[54:17] requires
[54:18] so it'd be better for us not to hear
[54:20] than to hear so we're afraid to hear
[54:23] but whether you take the time to listen
[54:24] to it or not amen
[54:26] you're still responsible to it but so
[54:29] many times we're afraid to hear more
[54:32] because it requires a repentance
[54:36] and so people you ask them they're
[54:37] living a mediocre life and struggling
[54:39] you're saying
[54:40] well how much are you into the word i'm
[54:42] just having struggles
[54:43] you're having struggles because you're
[54:45] not in the word you're not on the word
[54:46] because you're afraid you can't pay the
[54:47] price
[54:49] it takes a total death to self
[54:53] it takes a complete surrender sunday and
[54:56] wednesday won't do it
[54:58] it's got to be every day feasting on the
[55:01] word of god
[55:02] and making a total sellout to whatever i
[55:04] find i find
[55:05] whatever it says it says however it
[55:07] strips me it strips
[55:09] me however it exposes me it exposes me
[55:11] but i'm saying god if it's wrong
[55:13] take it away i don't want it not that we
[55:16] look halfway or are we dabbled just a
[55:19] little bit because
[55:20] we're afraid of what we'll hear the
[55:22] prophet of god saying
[55:26] i don't want to be afraid i want to say
[55:29] lay me bear
[55:31] strip me down take that sword and cut
[55:35] everything off even my own spirit
[55:39] until there's nothing left but what's in
[55:41] the soul
[55:49] the message oneness prophet says now
[55:51] when adam and eve listened to the lie of
[55:52] the devil the holy image of god left
[55:54] them
[55:55] their fellowship was broken with god we
[55:57] read this on sunday
[55:59] their fellowship of oneness with god was
[56:01] broken the very minute they
[56:02] listened to the lie of the devil that
[56:04] broke their fellowship
[56:06] and the very minute that you listen to
[56:08] the lie of the devil it'll break your
[56:10] fellowship
[56:11] that's the very minute that you go out
[56:12] from the presence of god like she did
[56:15] is when you failed to take god's word
[56:17] just
[56:18] as it is
[56:21] you want to know when your fellowship
[56:22] with god was broken
[56:24] it was the minute you didn't take the
[56:26] word just
[56:28] as it is
[56:31] some excuse some reasoning
[56:34] some explanation for why this won't work
[56:37] here
[56:38] and the minute we do that we break our
[56:40] fellowship with god
[56:44] first peter 4 17 for the time has come
[56:47] that
[56:48] judgment must begin at the house of god
[56:52] hallelujah that doesn't mean now now we
[56:55] have to be careful that we realize
[56:57] the scriptures that we're going to show
[56:58] especially this scripture doesn't show
[57:00] that the church bypasses judgment
[57:05] according to the scripture judgment must
[57:08] begin at the house of god
[57:09] so the bride cannot bypass judgment
[57:13] but the bride must come to judgment but
[57:15] she'll never be in the tribulation
[57:17] and she'll never come to the white
[57:19] throne judgment
[57:21] but it doesn't mean that she doesn't
[57:22] come to judgment
[57:24] right what is the whole purpose of the
[57:27] four guards around the throne
[57:28] to keep out and to let in they're
[57:30] judging
[57:33] first corinthians 11 31 and 32 for if we
[57:35] would judge ourselves
[57:37] we should not be judged but when we are
[57:40] judged
[57:41] we are chastened of the lord that we
[57:43] should not be condemned with the world
[57:46] no one bypasses judgment
[57:51] if you judge yourselves you're not going
[57:54] to be judged
[57:55] if you don't judge yourself you're going
[57:57] to be judged
[57:59] [Laughter]
[58:01] you're going to be judged why because
[58:04] then the lord will chasten you
[58:06] so that you won't be condemned with the
[58:07] world because if you bypass judgment now
[58:11] you'll stand in judgment later and god
[58:14] will not let his children bypass
[58:16] judgment now because he does not intend
[58:17] for them to stand in that judgment
[58:19] so if you don't judge yourself you'll be
[58:21] judged and chastened to the lord that
[58:22] you will not be condemned with the world
[58:24] that's grace friends
[58:26] that's absolute pure grace of god
[58:29] that if you fail you fail of your own
[58:32] accord
[58:33] to judge yourselves and you always judge
[58:34] yourselves by the word not by your
[58:36] neighbor
[58:37] not by the church not by other churches
[58:39] you judge yourself by the word
[58:41] amen and if you don't judge yourself you
[58:43] will be judged amen and if you don't
[58:46] and you will be judged that you shall be
[58:47] chastened so you won't be lost
[58:51] that's god's grace to us
[58:55] later seeing church age it says as many
[58:57] as i love i rebuke and chase and be
[58:59] zealous therefore and repent
[59:00] this is the same message that john had
[59:02] as he cried out in the religious
[59:04] wilderness of pharisees sadducees and
[59:07] heathen
[59:07] repent there was no other course then
[59:10] there was no other course
[59:11] now there was no other way to go get
[59:14] back to god then
[59:15] there is no other way now it is repent
[59:18] change your mind turn around repent for
[59:22] why
[59:22] will you die if you don't repent you'll
[59:26] perish
[59:27] that's what john said repent or perish
[59:31] there's only two choices
[59:34] first john 1 19 if we confess our sins
[59:37] he is faithful than just to forgive us
[59:38] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[59:41] unrighteousness and the first seal he
[59:44] says now
[59:45] how can a man say that the bride of
[59:47] christ goes into the tribulation i can't
[59:48] understand it see
[59:50] she's take she took away from the
[59:51] tribulation if the church has been
[59:54] judged what
[59:58] if the church has been judged and they
[1:00:01] have judged themselves
[1:00:03] and have accepted the blood how can god
[1:00:06] judge a man that's perfectly totally
[1:00:09] sinless so how do you bypass judgment
[1:00:14] is to come to judgment and if you come
[1:00:17] to
[1:00:17] judgment amen you will bypass judgment
[1:00:21] remember there was a stone cut out of
[1:00:23] the mountain without hands
[1:00:25] remember in every body comes in contact
[1:00:29] with this stone
[1:00:32] the stone was cut and the stone is
[1:00:34] christ which is the word
[1:00:35] and the stone was cut out of the
[1:00:37] mountain without hands and it says
[1:00:39] everyone who falls upon this stone will
[1:00:42] be broken to pieces
[1:00:43] but all whom the stone falls on will be
[1:00:46] destroyed
[1:00:48] those who fall on the stone which is
[1:00:50] christ the word
[1:00:51] your life is broken to bits so that he
[1:00:53] can reassemble you according to his
[1:00:55] fashion according to the word
[1:00:57] so you either of your own accord fall on
[1:01:00] the stone
[1:01:00] that's by yourself will by your own by
[1:01:03] your own submission
[1:01:04] you either fall on the stone or the
[1:01:07] stone falls on you
[1:01:10] and if the phone stone falls on you
[1:01:12] you're destroyed
[1:01:15] if you fall on the stone you're broken
[1:01:18] up
[1:01:19] but not lost i say god break me up
[1:01:25] just mess me up so that i can be
[1:01:28] perfect hallelujah we're not content
[1:01:32] friends
[1:01:33] with a mediocre life that's not going to
[1:01:35] produce a rapture
[1:01:37] we are supposed to be the full
[1:01:39] manifestation
[1:01:40] of the full life of jesus christ on
[1:01:43] display
[1:01:45] if we can't come to that we're not
[1:01:47] coming to a rapture
[1:01:49] it is not it we have to get away
[1:01:52] from thinking a denominational thinking
[1:01:55] now denominational thinking is that i
[1:01:57] just cruise along and i keep going
[1:01:59] except jesus he's in my heart
[1:02:00] and i keep doing whatever i can first
[1:02:02] kingdom and someday he'll come down
[1:02:04] pick me up and away we go if you think
[1:02:07] that in the message you are
[1:02:08] lost because you've got to shout a voice
[1:02:12] and a trumpet
[1:02:13] amen and that voice is the voice of the
[1:02:15] archangel and that voice is
[1:02:17] in a certain place and that place is in
[1:02:20] the bride of jesus christ
[1:02:22] his voice is in the bride amen and there
[1:02:25] has to be something that
[1:02:27] we do in the rapture cycle there's got
[1:02:29] to be some a position that we
[1:02:31] come to of faith that we rise to
[1:02:35] we can we can't say i'm just going to go
[1:02:37] along like this and i'm going to accept
[1:02:38] everything to be true
[1:02:39] and one day god's going to come down
[1:02:41] split the skies everything's going to
[1:02:42] change
[1:02:43] no brothers and sisters it's you he's
[1:02:45] doing it through you
[1:02:46] in you with you and without you and in
[1:02:48] you he's not doing it
[1:02:50] and as long as we're sitting on our
[1:02:51] hands brother said as long as you're not
[1:02:53] doing what god leads you to do you're
[1:02:55] paralyzing the program of god
[1:02:57] and we're sitting on our hands waiting
[1:02:58] for god to do something supernatural
[1:03:00] when he's already done something
[1:03:02] supernatural he came back in the full
[1:03:04] power of his word
[1:03:06] he came back with his full life and all
[1:03:08] you have to do to get it is take and
[1:03:10] receive his word
[1:03:11] and if you take and receive the revealed
[1:03:13] word you get the life
[1:03:16] but you reject the word you reject the
[1:03:18] message you reject the messenger
[1:03:20] you reject that life
[1:03:24] there's no we gotta we gotta change
[1:03:28] friends
[1:03:29] we got to get away from 50 90 95
[1:03:33] is good enough we got to stop with
[1:03:36] 99 or i've been the believer 35 years
[1:03:39] we've got to throw all that out and
[1:03:41] throw it in the trash can it means
[1:03:42] nothing today i've been a believer since
[1:03:45] the prophet of god was here
[1:03:46] that's wonderful we respect that and
[1:03:48] honor that but you can come to that
[1:03:50] place amen like they followed moses
[1:03:52] through the wilderness all that time
[1:03:54] and they still rejected judas came with
[1:03:56] the lord
[1:03:57] he come all the way through healing
[1:03:58] campaigns and he was there when
[1:04:00] when when hundreds left he was there
[1:04:02] when the 70 left and he remained
[1:04:04] but he didn't go all the way in to be
[1:04:07] part of that mercy
[1:04:08] he didn't get that blood life on his
[1:04:10] altar amen so he was rejected
[1:04:15] 50 75 95
[1:04:18] that's not it it's a full surrendered
[1:04:21] life
[1:04:24] if brother branham if the prophet of god
[1:04:26] said you do this
[1:04:27] then do it if he said you don't do this
[1:04:31] then you don't do it
[1:04:36] we're not just sitting around having a
[1:04:38] picnic waiting for god to do
[1:04:40] something powerful he's doing something
[1:04:42] powerful
[1:04:43] now he's taking a human life
[1:04:46] and a fallen condition and by the
[1:04:48] baptism of the holy ghost with the full
[1:04:50] power of the word
[1:04:51] he's growing a church stronger and
[1:04:53] stronger and stronger
[1:04:55] she's taking him out of his word she's
[1:04:56] overcoming every obstacle
[1:04:58] because you're called to be an overcomer
[1:05:02] he's not the overcomer you're the
[1:05:05] overcomer
[1:05:06] he said i have already overcome
[1:05:10] and because i have already overcome i've
[1:05:13] got a reward for those who will
[1:05:15] overcome you can't depend on his
[1:05:18] overcoming
[1:05:18] he's already overcome now he's waiting
[1:05:22] for your
[1:05:23] overcoming and your overcoming is by
[1:05:26] the revealed word of this hour as the
[1:05:30] message of god
[1:05:31] has given to us in this day
[1:05:34] all of it hallelujah
[1:05:38] praise the lord brother ben tells an
[1:05:41] interesting story
[1:05:43] i'll just relate it to you here
[1:05:46] he says i do believe in purgatory
[1:05:54] does that confuse you i do believe in
[1:05:58] purgatory
[1:06:00] but i believe it's right now
[1:06:03] you purge your own soul purgatory means
[1:06:06] to purge
[1:06:07] when you see you've done something wrong
[1:06:08] get out there and clean it out of you by
[1:06:10] confession and crying
[1:06:11] and fasting and praying
[1:06:15] someone even laughed at me when the lord
[1:06:17] came here not long ago and gave me a
[1:06:19] vision
[1:06:20] i always wanted to see about binding
[1:06:22] that serpent how many remembers the
[1:06:23] vision of him binding the serpent
[1:06:25] he was the serpent was trying to strike
[1:06:27] at a friend it wouldn't strike brother
[1:06:28] try to strike a fan and he says you can
[1:06:30] bind it all right
[1:06:31] and so he binds it and it winds up in
[1:06:34] like a s pattern it chokes itself out
[1:06:36] blue smoke goes out of it he says you
[1:06:38] can unbind it and he speaks and unbinds
[1:06:40] and he binds it again so he's got this
[1:06:41] whole experience
[1:06:42] that's what he's referring to see that i
[1:06:45] always wanted to see about binding that
[1:06:46] serpent i
[1:06:47] always wondered how to i should step out
[1:06:50] like that when that's what i've wanted
[1:06:52] all my life then i began to fast and
[1:06:55] pray
[1:06:56] and he said what'd you do that for i
[1:06:59] said
[1:07:00] in there he's talking about in the
[1:07:01] vision he said i was not
[1:07:03] sincere enough remember in the vision he
[1:07:07] said
[1:07:08] you must be more sincere
[1:07:12] after he come then i wanted to purge
[1:07:14] myself
[1:07:15] not wait till you die and let some
[1:07:17] priest try purging you
[1:07:19] purge your souls brother brandon
[1:07:22] i mean he lived a life right and he
[1:07:25] lived the life
[1:07:26] in 1961 he has this vision and he's told
[1:07:29] he can bind the serpent
[1:07:30] and after that what does he do he says
[1:07:32] you must be more sincere
[1:07:34] he says here afterwards i went to
[1:07:36] fasting and praying
[1:07:38] because in there in that vision he told
[1:07:40] me you must be more
[1:07:42] sincere sincerity matters
[1:07:46] but it's got to be sincerity based on
[1:07:48] truth
[1:07:55] so we come back to the judgment seal now
[1:07:58] whenever you come to judgment you have
[1:08:00] two paths
[1:08:02] every judgment has two paths remember
[1:08:04] the white throne judgment
[1:08:07] you're either sheep or goats separated
[1:08:09] as sheep or ghost
[1:08:10] come into eternal life go into eternal
[1:08:12] damnation there's
[1:08:13] two paths always to judgment
[1:08:17] one path is rejection
[1:08:20] which always leads to destruction
[1:08:25] the other path is repentance
[1:08:28] that puts you in position to receive the
[1:08:31] seventh seal
[1:08:35] when did brother branham open the
[1:08:37] seventh seal
[1:08:39] in the sixth seal
[1:08:43] it was in the sixth seal because the
[1:08:45] seventh seal is not an
[1:08:46] not not a thing it's not a set of
[1:08:50] happenings
[1:08:51] the seventh seal is a person the seventh
[1:08:54] seal is the lord
[1:08:55] amen and it was the lord doing it all
[1:08:57] along remember
[1:08:58] remember when we talked about uh boaz
[1:09:02] and ruth
[1:09:02] boaz is going to redeem ruth and he
[1:09:04] comes and he gives her six
[1:09:06] measures of barley and
[1:09:09] six because the six reveals the seventh
[1:09:14] and six where's the seventh it's the one
[1:09:17] dishing out the sixth remember brother
[1:09:20] branham said when he revealed those six
[1:09:22] seals
[1:09:22] who revealed those six seals the seventh
[1:09:25] it was the seventh seal revealing the
[1:09:27] six seals
[1:09:29] all right in you know the the first
[1:09:32] miracle that jesus ever does
[1:09:34] he goes to a wedding it's a mirror it's
[1:09:36] amazing his first miracle takes place at
[1:09:38] a wedding
[1:09:39] because that's what this whole thing's
[1:09:40] about anyways and they don't have any
[1:09:42] wine
[1:09:43] so he tells them to take six jugs
[1:09:46] six jugs where's the seventh it's the
[1:09:49] seventh
[1:09:49] that's filling the six with wine that's
[1:09:52] converting the water to wine
[1:09:54] so it's always six and the seventh is
[1:09:56] always shown in the six
[1:09:57] so now in the sixth seal because brother
[1:09:59] branham told us that that sixth seal
[1:10:01] began
[1:10:02] under hitler and mussolini in those in
[1:10:04] world war ii and the sixth seal and the
[1:10:06] sixth trumpet which is world war two
[1:10:07] sound at the same time
[1:10:09] so brother brenner's ministry takes
[1:10:10] place under the sixth seal
[1:10:13] during the time of the sixth seal and in
[1:10:16] that ministry the seventh seal
[1:10:18] is revealed where in the sixth and these
[1:10:20] four beasts are bringing you to judgment
[1:10:22] and what's taking place in judgment you
[1:10:25] come to judgment
[1:10:26] and the word is a sword it's going to
[1:10:29] divide
[1:10:30] you have to either go to rejection
[1:10:33] to destruction or to acceptance
[1:10:37] and when you go into septons it'll put
[1:10:38] you in position
[1:10:40] the blood life will come on your heart
[1:10:44] your altar of your heart and it will put
[1:10:46] you in contact with the seventh seal
[1:10:48] the person himself but you have to go
[1:10:51] through the sixth seal
[1:10:53] how many says take me through the six
[1:10:55] you know because if you don't go through
[1:10:57] it
[1:10:58] now you're going to go through it during
[1:10:59] the tribulation period why
[1:11:01] for the purging of your souls brother
[1:11:04] branham said the foolish virgin is
[1:11:06] purged during the tribulation because
[1:11:08] she rejected the purging of the bleach
[1:11:10] of the blood of jesus christ
[1:11:12] and i say i want the purging of the
[1:11:14] blood the
[1:11:15] the bleach of the blood of jesus right
[1:11:17] now and the way it purges you
[1:11:19] is to cut off of you everything that's
[1:11:21] not the word the sword has to come
[1:11:23] and judge what is word and not word and
[1:11:25] the sword has to be laid
[1:11:27] even to the root of the tree
[1:11:31] all the way to everything that's not of
[1:11:33] christ is cut away
[1:11:35] and the only thing standing there now is
[1:11:37] the real genuine life from the soul
[1:11:39] connecting to the seventh seal because
[1:11:42] remember it's going to be the bride
[1:11:47] the bride of jesus christ
[1:11:50] is the seventh seal
[1:11:54] remember the bride coming of christ
[1:11:57] the seventh seal has something to do
[1:11:59] with the coming of the lord
[1:12:01] and we're told that this is now the
[1:12:03] bride coming of christ
[1:12:06] so it's attached to the seventh seal
[1:12:08] when does the bride come
[1:12:10] the bride comes under the sixth seal
[1:12:14] and the sixth thousandth year since the
[1:12:16] fall and the number six which is man's
[1:12:18] number
[1:12:19] in man which is number six is number
[1:12:22] seven
[1:12:24] man's number is six inside of man is
[1:12:27] number seven
[1:12:28] the holy ghost baptism in man in carnal
[1:12:32] flesh
[1:12:33] in man is the seventh seal on display
[1:12:36] but you'll never come to it unless you
[1:12:38] pass through the judgment seal
[1:12:40] your flesh has to be judged your spirit
[1:12:43] has to be judged
[1:12:44] amen and cut away from you
[1:12:47] brother branham says joining church will
[1:12:49] never cover sin
[1:12:51] no dry eyed confession will ever cover
[1:12:53] sin it takes sorrow and repentance
[1:12:55] get this sorrow and repentance and the
[1:12:58] grace of god to cover sin
[1:13:00] for the blood of jesus christ the one
[1:13:01] that god killed at calvary to cover sin
[1:13:05] he said the bible tells us when we've
[1:13:06] done wrong that we should purge our
[1:13:08] souls by the holy spirit get down
[1:13:11] let the holy spirit reveal to us that
[1:13:12] we're wrong doing wrong
[1:13:14] and there stay before him till you die
[1:13:16] out purging
[1:13:18] our souls
[1:13:22] in ephesians church he says now it does
[1:13:24] not mean that she could not have
[1:13:26] repented
[1:13:27] it does not mean that we cannot repent
[1:13:29] we can but it must be quickly it must be
[1:13:32] a true heart cry to god in sorrow
[1:13:35] and then god will restore the glory
[1:13:38] shall come again how many wants the
[1:13:41] glory to come again
[1:13:43] the glory of the life of jesus christ
[1:13:45] the bride on display
[1:13:46] it will only come through repentance
[1:13:49] amen
[1:13:50] and repentance comes through the sixth
[1:13:51] seal
[1:13:53] because the word is here to judge us you
[1:13:56] either
[1:13:57] fall on the stone or the stone falls on
[1:14:00] you
[1:14:02] you're either judged now or you're
[1:14:04] judged later
[1:14:05] but nobody bypasses judgment
[1:14:10] we're not getting away with anything
[1:14:14] and we'll find if we're seed of god
[1:14:17] the children of god they don't get away
[1:14:20] with
[1:14:21] anything other people
[1:14:24] can it works for them it seems to go all
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:27] they seem even to prosper they can live
[1:14:30] in hypocrisy
[1:14:31] in a hybrid condition halfway believing
[1:14:34] the message
[1:14:35] it seems like they prosper they get the
[1:14:36] raises they get the jobs they have the
[1:14:38] house they have the cars
[1:14:39] it seems like everything's working out
[1:14:41] remember the seed of god don't get away
[1:14:43] with
[1:14:43] anything because if you don't judge
[1:14:46] yourselves you will be judged and
[1:14:48] chastened to the lord
[1:14:49] that you will not be condemned with the
[1:14:50] world you say why
[1:14:52] why is it always me why nothing works
[1:14:54] out for me why am i
[1:14:56] always going through the ringer why is
[1:14:57] the preacher always preaching on me why
[1:14:59] am i always crying out to the lord why
[1:15:00] am i always wrong
[1:15:04] because you're the seed of god and if
[1:15:06] you don't judge yourself he's going to
[1:15:07] judge you and chasing you that you will
[1:15:08] not be condemned with the world
[1:15:10] because everybody comes through judgment
[1:15:12] and the seed of god come through it
[1:15:14] now thy rod and thy staff
[1:15:19] they comfort me
[1:15:25] now they guard the mercy seat when god
[1:15:27] is in his
[1:15:29] shekinah glory where is
[1:15:32] his holy gosh a kind of glory where is
[1:15:35] his true throne
[1:15:37] in the heart of men where is the
[1:15:39] shekinah glory
[1:15:40] in the heart of men where are these four
[1:15:43] beasts guarding the way
[1:15:45] keeping the way to the tree of life
[1:15:48] guarding what
[1:15:49] the shekinah glory of god only
[1:15:52] letting you come through the sixth seal
[1:15:55] to the seventh
[1:15:57] never letting you come and compromise
[1:16:01] where's the shekinah glory at the mercy
[1:16:03] seat is that right
[1:16:04] they guard that shekinah glory listen
[1:16:07] friends
[1:16:07] when it goes to show that every
[1:16:09] scallywag can't come there
[1:16:11] and take of that you've got to be
[1:16:13] prepared before you come into the
[1:16:15] presence of it
[1:16:18] doesn't happen haphazard it doesn't come
[1:16:20] from without sacrifice you can never
[1:16:22] you could have never approached to the
[1:16:23] presence of god without a sacrifice
[1:16:26] and you still cannot come into his
[1:16:27] presence without sacrifice
[1:16:29] only now it's personal sacrifice of my
[1:16:33] own life
[1:16:34] and i lay it down and i choose to die to
[1:16:37] have his
[1:16:39] and so now the four beasts are still
[1:16:42] around the throne and you see through
[1:16:46] the church ages
[1:16:48] lion ox man eagle
[1:16:51] what were they they were around the
[1:16:53] throne what was the throne
[1:16:55] those genuine believers that were coming
[1:16:57] through each age
[1:16:58] and what was surrounding the throne of
[1:17:00] god these four beasts
[1:17:02] keeping the way to the throne of god god
[1:17:05] bless you saints let's all stand
[1:17:09] hallelujah well
[1:17:12] we've got some more notes for later
[1:17:16] god is good friends it's getting
[1:17:19] very very hard to preach less than an
[1:17:22] hour and a half
[1:17:24] because the word each one of these seals
[1:17:27] goes genesis to revelations
[1:17:29] they unlock the entire mystery of the
[1:17:31] whole bible
[1:17:34] and i say god i want it all i want
[1:17:37] every jot and every tittle every precept
[1:17:41] upon precept every line upon line if
[1:17:44] i've got to get it here a little and
[1:17:45] there a little i want it all
[1:17:48] amen let's just pray musicians if you'd
[1:17:50] like to come
[1:17:52] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[1:17:54] for this wonderful time
[1:17:56] and god we recognize lord that this
[1:17:59] isn't a time to jump up and down
[1:18:01] lord this isn't a time to shout this is
[1:18:04] a time to come
[1:18:05] to the stone that was cut out of the
[1:18:07] mountain without hands lord
[1:18:09] it's time to throw ourselves down like
[1:18:12] you did in gethsemane
[1:18:14] and die completely to ourselves
[1:18:18] lord we don't want our own way anymore
[1:18:21] we don't want the way that the culture
[1:18:24] tells us social norms or what we've
[1:18:26] adapted through through the message over
[1:18:28] years we want what you called for lord
[1:18:30] in your word
[1:18:31] in the original lord your original
[1:18:33] desire in your heart for a bride that's
[1:18:35] what we want to come to lord
[1:18:38] we want to look like that image you had
[1:18:39] of her before the foundation of the
[1:18:41] world we want to come to that now
[1:18:43] and we know it means a lot of shaving
[1:18:45] down but lord we're saying
[1:18:46] shave us down i raise my hands and i say
[1:18:49] shave me down lord
[1:18:50] i'm laying myself down on the altar take
[1:18:53] this sacrifice consume it with your fire
[1:18:56] burn all of the dross out of me lord if
[1:18:58] you've got to beat me and roll me around
[1:19:00] and beat me do it lord until you bring
[1:19:02] me to that perfect place
[1:19:04] god forgive us lord forgive us for
[1:19:07] accepting things we should have never
[1:19:08] accepted lord
[1:19:10] forgive us for doing things we should
[1:19:11] have never done but lord i just pray
[1:19:15] that if we can repent according to what
[1:19:17] your prophet said
[1:19:18] the glory will return lord we pray that
[1:19:21] your glory
[1:19:22] lord would return the glory that was
[1:19:25] poured out lord on the day of pentecost
[1:19:27] we're praying that that glory would
[1:19:28] return god
[1:19:30] through repentance lord that we would
[1:19:31] judge ourselves now by your word
[1:19:33] and that you would bring us back to that
[1:19:35] position lord
[1:19:36] to that original church position that
[1:19:39] that day that that
[1:19:40] holy ghost was poured out on the day of
[1:19:42] pentecost lord that's what you're
[1:19:43] bringing us to
[1:19:44] that's what we want lord cut out of us
[1:19:47] lord by the sword of your word
[1:19:49] everything that's not like you anything
[1:19:51] that does not align to that
[1:19:53] cut it out lord help us to come to your
[1:19:55] word
[1:19:56] and your word only lord that's our
[1:19:59] desire that's what we long for
[1:20:01] we pray that you just purge our hearts
[1:20:03] now lord as we lay before you
[1:20:06] reveal to us anything lord that's in our
[1:20:08] lives
[1:20:09] that you want out that's not according
[1:20:11] to your word that's not a faith
[1:20:13] and that pray lord that you would purge
[1:20:14] it and how god
[1:20:16] by the power of your holy spirit just
[1:20:18] move it out of our lives
[1:20:20] and lord give us faith to accept your
[1:20:22] word
[1:20:23] we love you god we lay down our soul we
[1:20:25] date on our lives before you
[1:20:28] pray that you'd consume us lord lift us
[1:20:30] up lord to be that mercy seat on this
[1:20:33] earth
[1:20:34] let your shekinah glory flow through us
[1:20:37] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:20:40] amen i just want to say
[1:20:45] there was a day in one day of the year
[1:20:49] in all of israel and it was a day
[1:20:53] when they would celebrate the feast of
[1:20:55] atonement
[1:20:56] and that day is the day that the high
[1:20:58] priest would go in
[1:21:01] and he would go with blood all the way
[1:21:04] to the mercy seat of god because if
[1:21:07] there was blood on the mercy seat
[1:21:10] then there was mercy but if there was no
[1:21:12] blood on the mercy seat it became
[1:21:13] judgment
[1:21:14] instead of the presence of god blessing
[1:21:16] israel the presence of god would have
[1:21:18] cursed israel
[1:21:20] so this was the most significant day of
[1:21:22] the whole year
[1:21:23] because if the high priest wasn't
[1:21:24] accepted they would have to purify
[1:21:26] another and send him in because if there
[1:21:27] was
[1:21:28] no blood on that mercy seat then that
[1:21:31] that presence of god would slay them all
[1:21:33] because they could not stand judgment
[1:21:36] there was no blood of jesus christ yet
[1:21:38] to abolish their says they couldn't
[1:21:39] stand judgment
[1:21:41] they needed mercy the only way that they
[1:21:44] could find mercy is when that high
[1:21:45] priest would go in
[1:21:47] but it's amazing that if you go back and
[1:21:49] read in leviticus 16 and leviticus 23 on
[1:21:52] the day of atonement
[1:21:54] on this day of atonement they were
[1:21:55] commanded every man
[1:21:57] to afflict his soul the day of atonement
[1:22:01] the most significant day the greatest
[1:22:03] day
[1:22:04] when the high priest would go in and
[1:22:05] cover the sins of ignorance with blood
[1:22:08] all the sins that they were doing that
[1:22:09] didn't know about was going to be
[1:22:11] completely covered they were going to be
[1:22:12] free
[1:22:13] it wasn't a day of rejoicing it wasn't a
[1:22:15] shouting it wasn't ascending gifts back
[1:22:17] and forth
[1:22:18] it was a day that they would fast and
[1:22:20] mourn and afflict their souls
[1:22:22] and humble themselves and they would
[1:22:24] become to afflict means to become
[1:22:26] low amen to bow down to humble
[1:22:29] yourselves
[1:22:30] and they would begin to mourn and they
[1:22:32] would begin to weep
[1:22:33] why because of their sins
[1:22:38] the feast of atonement the necessity to
[1:22:41] go in and offer blood was because of
[1:22:43] their sins
[1:22:44] and they weren't jumping up and down
[1:22:45] they were coming to the judgment seal
[1:22:47] and they were going to be they were
[1:22:49] going to be accepted or rejected
[1:22:53] now if we think ahead to israel
[1:22:56] uh to the 144 000 there's two witnesses
[1:22:59] that are going to come and those two
[1:23:00] witnesses come
[1:23:01] it's going to be during the tribulation
[1:23:03] period why because the jews have
[1:23:06] refused jesus christ and now they have
[1:23:09] to be purged in tribulation
[1:23:11] and 144 000 even have to give their
[1:23:14] lives amen as payment
[1:23:16] give their lives because of the
[1:23:17] rejection of the nation of israel
[1:23:19] and so now they're there and the two
[1:23:21] witnesses are witnessing to them
[1:23:22] and when they realize jesus christ is
[1:23:25] the atonement
[1:23:26] and they realize that they were wrong
[1:23:28] and they go to accept him
[1:23:29] it's not a day of dancing and jumping
[1:23:32] and shouting
[1:23:33] everyone separate into their own homes
[1:23:35] and mourn as
[1:23:36] one who's mourning for their only son
[1:23:40] when they see jesus christ and they
[1:23:41] recognize him and they see themselves as
[1:23:44] wrong
[1:23:44] they afflict their souls everyone's
[1:23:46] separated into their own house
[1:23:48] and they said where did you receive
[1:23:49] these wounds and he said in the house
[1:23:52] of my friends there's a times and many
[1:23:56] times in our lives
[1:23:57] that we have to come to the sixth seal
[1:23:59] now remember this happens
[1:24:01] during the sixth seal the 144 thousand
[1:24:05] the affliction of the souls we have to
[1:24:08] come to the sixth seal friends
[1:24:10] and it's not a time of dancing and
[1:24:12] shouting and running about
[1:24:13] it's a time to mourn it's a time to
[1:24:16] afflict your soul
[1:24:17] because you recognize i'm wrong and i've
[1:24:20] been wrong and i've been wrong for a
[1:24:22] long time
[1:24:23] and without the blood of jesus christ
[1:24:24] i'll never be right
[1:24:27] then you mess up again and you come back
[1:24:29] to mourning and afflicting your soul and
[1:24:31] you say
[1:24:31] god without you i'll never be right i
[1:24:34] can never be right there's nothing
[1:24:36] in me that will let me be right in this
[1:24:38] flesh body
[1:24:39] i'm i in my flesh there's no good thing
[1:24:42] no
[1:24:42] not one i'm going to fail you every time
[1:24:45] lord
[1:24:46] i'm coming here afflicted of soul and
[1:24:48] i'm saying god if you don't consume this
[1:24:50] sacrifice
[1:24:51] if you don't kill me dead and give me a
[1:24:53] new life i'm never going to make it
[1:24:56] it's a time of afflictions it's not a
[1:24:58] time
[1:24:59] it's not you don't receive the baptism
[1:25:01] of the holy ghost
[1:25:02] running around the room and shouting and
[1:25:04] rejoicing you receive it in tears
[1:25:06] amen and fasting and praying down saying
[1:25:08] god i am
[1:25:09] nothing absolutely nothing and without
[1:25:12] you i'll always be nothing
[1:25:13] i'm damned and i'm doomed and i'm
[1:25:15] predestinated
[1:25:17] i've been preconditioned to fail but i
[1:25:19] have to have a new life
[1:25:21] i have to have a burning out i have to
[1:25:23] have a total consuming of the sacrifice
[1:25:26] and you've got to totally consume this
[1:25:28] sacrifice
[1:25:31] it's travail of soul friends it's
[1:25:33] weeping
[1:25:36] then you go along and you find out that
[1:25:38] all sticky cockleburg nature gets in the
[1:25:41] way and
[1:25:42] you find you trip up again and you do
[1:25:44] something you shouldn't have done
[1:25:47] you come right back to travail a soul
[1:25:50] say god i now know over and over
[1:25:54] again there's nothing good in me
[1:25:57] nothing worthwhile who can deliver me
[1:26:00] from this body of death
[1:26:03] say lord i need you again
[1:26:06] we look back on our lives and we see
[1:26:09] we've taken this too lightly
[1:26:13] transgress the word of god disobey a
[1:26:15] prophet of god
[1:26:17] take what the culture tells us is
[1:26:19] acceptable and accept it
[1:26:20] take what other people in the church are
[1:26:22] doing is acceptable and doing it
[1:26:24] just going along in a church life and
[1:26:26] and becoming
[1:26:27] in a lukewarm condition we've taken it
[1:26:30] too lightly friends
[1:26:32] it's time we say god no more
[1:26:36] i want to die all over again
[1:26:40] i want you to consume me all over again
[1:26:44] lord give me your life give me your
[1:26:46] spirit
[1:26:47] reveal your word help me not to fail you
[1:26:49] anymore lord
[1:26:52] we are constantly coming to travail of
[1:26:54] soul
[1:26:55] brother branham said we purge our souls
[1:26:59] daily so we backslide
[1:27:03] every day and he said we purge our souls
[1:27:08] daily there's got to be a time
[1:27:11] where every day we take this serious
[1:27:14] that's why we come to communion
[1:27:18] we come serious we come serious and say
[1:27:22] lord
[1:27:23] have i let the white horse rider affect
[1:27:27] me
[1:27:28] am i in deception somewhere in my life
[1:27:31] open my eyes and show me lord
[1:27:34] let me die a greater death let me die
[1:27:37] and come to communion and receive life
[1:27:40] let me recognize your atonement your
[1:27:42] price that you paid to cover those sins
[1:27:44] but i've got to confess them i've got to
[1:27:46] repent of them
[1:27:47] so that they could be under the blood we
[1:27:50] come
[1:27:51] serious we come we come with affliction
[1:27:54] of soul we come
[1:27:55] as to the feast of atonements and the
[1:27:58] feast of atonement those two witnesses
[1:28:01] sound the seventh trumpet bringing them
[1:28:02] to the feast of atonement
[1:28:04] where they mourn as everyone mourns
[1:28:08] sometimes we have to mourn because it's
[1:28:10] our sins that put him on the cross
[1:28:12] we have to mourn because it's our own
[1:28:14] choices that have caused us all our own
[1:28:16] problems
[1:28:18] and in mourning there's a psalm that
[1:28:21] says thou
[1:28:22] has turned my mourning into rejoicing
[1:28:27] because through mourning you get a fresh
[1:28:29] perspective of the seventh seal
[1:28:31] the person of jesus christ and the
[1:28:33] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:35] and that that fellowship that was broken
[1:28:37] comes back like this
[1:28:40] brother branham said when we do wrong
[1:28:41] the holy ghost takes its flight right
[1:28:44] and he said when we repent he comes back
[1:28:47] broken fellowship because of deeds done
[1:28:49] but through repentance restored
[1:28:51] fellowship and through the
[1:28:53] through the sixth seal you get a fresh
[1:28:55] vision of the seventh
[1:28:57] and that's when we come up after
[1:28:59] afflicting the soul
[1:29:00] and it says thou has turned my mourning
[1:29:02] into rejec rejoicing
[1:29:04] my night and today my affliction into
[1:29:08] dancing
[1:29:10] how many wants to go that path
[1:29:13] i'd rather be a little tore up now than
[1:29:16] tore up on the day of the white throne
[1:29:17] judgment
[1:29:19] brother brahm said a christian has
[1:29:21] always tore up wanting to do the will of
[1:29:23] god
[1:29:25] it's okay to be tore up it's okay to
[1:29:28] afflict your soul
[1:29:29] it's okay to repent and it's okay
[1:29:32] to receive that fresh outpouring of the
[1:29:34] holy ghost that renewed vigor
[1:29:36] that renewed vision that renewed
[1:29:38] fellowship
[1:29:40] amen let's bow our heads and pray again
[1:29:44] god lord as we're speaking of atonement
[1:29:47] i just feel lord
[1:29:50] that we need to just lay our lives down
[1:29:54] too much is consuming us lord
[1:29:57] too much of the world too much of our
[1:30:01] own families
[1:30:03] too much of our own ambitions our own
[1:30:05] dreams our
[1:30:06] own desires god is a body we're asking
[1:30:11] that you would just
[1:30:12] consume us all over again
[1:30:16] burn out the dross all over again
[1:30:20] we can't do this ourselves lord we're
[1:30:23] never going to make it
[1:30:25] we're never going to be good enough but
[1:30:28] god if we can die
[1:30:30] you've promised to resurrect us
[1:30:34] lord if we don't die now
[1:30:37] and let you resurrect us in newness of
[1:30:39] life by the baptism the holy ghost
[1:30:42] we'll never take the resurrection in the
[1:30:44] rapture
[1:30:46] we have to die now to be resurrected now
[1:30:50] if we ever hope to be resurrected then
[1:30:53] god let us die let us die
[1:30:57] but there's a promise lord if we'll go
[1:31:00] down in the likeness of your death
[1:31:02] we'll come forth in the likeness of your
[1:31:04] resurrection
[1:31:06] i pray lord if we die to ourselves right
[1:31:08] here tonight i pray god
[1:31:09] that you would give us lord the likeness
[1:31:12] of your resurrection let us come forth

[1:31:26] work put us in the service

[1:31:36] through us we thank you for what we've
[1:31:38] done lord as we go our own way
[1:31:40] we go back to our homes we pray lord
[1:31:43] that you would help us not to forget
[1:31:45] what we've learned here tonight
[1:31:47] that there's a path lord to the mercy
[1:31:49] seat there's a path lord
[1:31:52] lord and it has to be covered in blood
[1:31:54] which is your life
[1:31:55] we pray god that you would give us that
[1:31:57] life
[1:31:59] we ask that you would cover us lord and
[1:32:00] you would accept us lord
[1:32:03] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:32:07] god bless your friends we appreciate you
[1:32:10] being here
[1:32:11] god is good brother branham said the way
[1:32:14] up is down
[1:32:16] if you want to be exalted be a base if
[1:32:18] you want to see how great you can be see
[1:32:20] how low you can become
[1:32:22] there's nothing wrong with affliction of
[1:32:24] soul and abasing yourself
[1:32:26] not a thing brother branham did it all
[1:32:28] the time
[1:32:29] you know in the prayer lines when
[1:32:31] brother brendan would call the prayer
[1:32:32] line
[1:32:33] he would call the prayer line then he
[1:32:35] would start talking and chatting and you
[1:32:37] know people are standing there
[1:32:39] then he'd make a comment you know i'm
[1:32:40] waiting on something right
[1:32:42] i'm just a man i can't help you unless
[1:32:45] he comes how many has heard that
[1:32:48] brother brethren gets to this point over
[1:32:49] and over again on the tapes just listen
[1:32:51] to it
[1:32:51] the lion's called they're standing there
[1:32:53] he begins to greet people and tell
[1:32:55] testimonies and start talking
[1:32:57] and you can tell he's waiting for time
[1:32:58] and the angel of the lord's not coming
[1:33:00] and so there's nothing that he can do
[1:33:01] and he even confesses i'm waiting on
[1:33:03] something
[1:33:04] and then the very next thing he starts
[1:33:05] doing is repenting
[1:33:08] now if i've said anything wrong here
[1:33:09] tonight if i've done anything that's
[1:33:11] wrong if i've heard anybody
[1:33:13] i'm sorry go back and listen to the
[1:33:15] tapes that's his path
[1:33:17] he's waiting lord is not coming what's
[1:33:19] he do he immediately starts repenting
[1:33:21] before an audience of people
[1:33:24] if i've said anything wrong if i've done
[1:33:25] anything that's not right
[1:33:27] lord if i've done anything wrong would
[1:33:28] you forgive me
[1:33:30] and then he goes he's here he's here
[1:33:34] why repentance always brings you to the
[1:33:37] seventh seal
[1:33:39] he demonstrated to us the path he showed
[1:33:42] us exactly how to do it
[1:33:43] he goes to pray for a baby amen after
[1:33:46] having lied
[1:33:46] and the angel lord said how can you pray
[1:33:48] for that baby after you lied
[1:33:50] what does he do he goes right back and
[1:33:52] he repents amen
[1:33:53] he doesn't just repent to the lord he
[1:33:55] goes back to the lawyer he lied to
[1:33:57] he had to make it right with his wife he
[1:33:58] had to make it right with the lord and
[1:34:00] then he come
[1:34:00] right back with a fresh renewed seventh
[1:34:04] seal experience
[1:34:05] and he prays for the baby and god heals
[1:34:07] the baby
[1:34:09] amen the way up is down if you want to
[1:34:12] be great belittle
