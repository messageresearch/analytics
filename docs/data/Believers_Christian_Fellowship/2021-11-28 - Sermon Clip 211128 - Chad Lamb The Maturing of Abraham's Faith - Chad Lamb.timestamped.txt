[0:00] i'm so thankful
[0:02] for the account in hebrews
[0:05] because the account in hebrews to me is
[0:08] the heavenly account
[0:11] when you just read hebrews and you don't
[0:13] read genesis you're like abraham was a
[0:15] great man
[0:18] by faith he left this land by faith he
[0:20] did this by faith and he was looking for
[0:22] a city all of those things are 100 true
[0:25] by faith he left his home
[0:27] by faith he's so drowned in a strange
[0:29] land by faith amen but the bible's not
[0:32] listing that he didn't fully obey
[0:34] because he took lot along he didn't
[0:36] fully obey because of his father he
[0:37] didn't he didn't fully obey because he
[0:39] left the land it's only looking at what
[0:41] abraham believed and abraham believed
[0:43] the promise even if his actions were
[0:45] missteps
[0:47] even if for a little bit he stepped to
[0:48] the right god will bring him back he
[0:50] stepped to the left god will bring him
[0:51] back but the heavenly record only looks
[0:53] at what abraham believed and all along
[0:56] abraham believed the word of god
[0:58] he believed what god said he believed
[1:00] the promise of god he did obey he did
[1:03] walk amen when where he was lacking god
[1:06] was working out the details
[1:09] i hope that there's just a heavenly
[1:10] account of my life and says he believed
[1:13] the message of the hour he stood fast
[1:15] with the word of god he believed what
[1:17] the prophet said amen because i can look
[1:19] back on my life and say i believed but i
[1:21] still did that i believed but i allowed
[1:23] that compromise i believe but i still
[1:25] went along with this even though i knew
[1:26] it wasn't right amen i want all those
[1:28] things erased from my records i want a
[1:30] hebrew account of my life amen that says
[1:33] he believed the message when he heard it
[1:35] he believed it
[1:37] he walked out of his denomination and he
[1:40] walked into the promise of god and he
[1:41] believed the message and left us home
[1:43] and left all of this and left
[1:45] relationships
[1:47] that's the heavenly account
[1:50] the reality was i prayed tears full in
[1:52] my pillow saying god please don't let me
[1:54] be rejected by my family
[1:57] god if i could stay here and win them
[1:59] over god if i could just stay in the
[2:01] church and change the church
[2:06] the earthly account
[2:08] and the heavenly account are looking at
[2:09] two different pictures
[2:12] the earthly account is looking at my
[2:14] actions
[2:16] the heavenly accounts looking at my
[2:17] faith
