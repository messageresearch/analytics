fulfill your purpose in our lives we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen may God bless you while you're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to Mark chapter 12. we'll read a portion of scripture from there and I say I was really disappointed to cancel service on Sunday especially Christmas morning it's such a unique opportunity to have service on Christmas morning and I was really disappointed but I I see the hand of God in it all and God is good and we thank God for that I'm so thankful nobody was got in trouble in the storm and what a unique storm I said I've never seen two or three inches of snow shut down shut down businesses and everything for two or three days so but we tried to go down to see my grandma Saturday morning got down the highway we got down so far we decided to turn around come back because it wasn't working out too well they had the highway shut down and the detour around the highway had a wreck on it and everything was bad so I come back and I just decided it's not going to work so it was a real disappointment but I'm so thankful to brother Franco that he was able to play that tape and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to that message and it just set the day off right for our family and uh and I have a testimony I'll share about that in just a minute but it was quite a blessing so it's good to be here tonight I pray you had a wonderful Christmas I want to pray it was a blessing to you and as we look to New Year I pray it's a blessing for you also amen Let's uh let's read here Mark chapter 12 verse 41. it says and Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were Rich cast in much and there were there came a certain poor Widow and she threw in two bites which make a farthing and he called into his disciples and saith unto them verily I say unto you that this poor Widow hath cast more in than all they which has cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her one did cast in all that she had even all her living amen God bless you as you take your seats we pray that God will bless us as we look at his word amen I just want to take a minute and say thank you to everybody who sent us cards and picture cards and gifts and cookies and treats and everything else we were really blessed by by your show of affection by your love and we love you all very much and we appreciate everything everything that you do every little thing every word everything you do it means a lot to us and so we really appreciate that also this Sunday will be the regular Sunday morning service it'll be New Year's Day and we're just going to have the morning service only and also want to remind you that we're not going to be opening the sanctuary Saturday night for prayer time we won't do that this Saturday we'll get back on the regular schedule next Saturday and I said before we played to take God's gifts always find their places and I was just led to that I was thinking Saturday of something to play for everybody I knew that many of us would be stuck in our homes and traveling wouldn't be that easy we weren't going to be gathering for church and I knew brother random preached so many wonderful Christmas messages and that he would title his Christmas message and and I was just drawn to this one for no particular reason but I felt a pull to it and I knew generally what it was about I've listened to it many times as many of you have so I just it was in my heart so I asked brother Franco if he could play and he did and that was wonderful but I had a message already to preach God had given a thought to me several weeks ago and I've been meditating on it and working on it and and so I was disappointed you know I couldn't come and preach what was on my heart for Christmas but as I sat and listened to the tape brother random goes right into an abortionate tape right into the very thing God was dealing with me some quotes I was looking for but couldn't find and I'm taking my paper out and writing down these these paragraph references so I can go back and look at it later and it was almost like God delayed this I mean uh uh for me anyways because there was a heart to this message a portion that really Consolidated for me as I was listening to the message so for me I was having a double Jubilee and I was thanking God for his goodness and for all the subtle things that he does those little directions that little guidance amen we can miss it so many times but God's hand is in our lives and I'm so thankful for that so even in our disappointment there's a blessing amen so God's been really really good to us and so I just wanted to say that for my title I wanted to take what do we give God what do we give God because you know at Christmas season everybody's thinking about the gift that God gave to us you know he he came as his only begotten son to give to us the Lamb of God for for the Redemption of our souls and we also think about the gifts you know as we were listening to the message the gifts that the the major I brought and the appropriate gifts that they brought and the gifts that we get maybe for our children or somebody gives to us and and there's so much but then I was thinking about what do we give God I mean what do you give somebody who created all things what do you give I mean there's always the question is what do you give to the person who's got everything and what do you give to the person who created everything and and so I had this thought in my heart and I'm just going to share with it as it has been given to me as I've been meditating on it for the last couple of weeks but we see here this this one oh and by the way before I forget today is another very special day because we have a special birthday in our family today is David's birthday happy birthday David amen his birthday being three days after Christmas it's always overshadowed by another event you know it's a happy birthday but uh as we look at this this uh portion out of the scripture where this woman throws in two mites it wasn't the amount of money that she threw into the treasury that impressed Christ it doesn't matter if there's two mites 10 mites 20 mice 200 mites one my it wasn't the amount of money that was impressive or caught his attention what he made note of is that she gave all and and what she brought was was much greater than what anybody else had brought in that day and that time that Jesus was standing there watching them bring to the treasury and deposit some large sums of money and no doubt there was many different kinds of offering or different types of people giving different amounts but the one that he noted was the one who gave all and and when we look at this it's it's in the scripture for a reason Jesus makes note of it to the disciples for a reason is because when God has given us everything I think the one thing that we can give God is everything and and what I've looked at here is God has has set up his laws his ways of operating and he doesn't change them and he's given us free choice and set us up on free moral agency and God is not going to violate that law that he established he's given us the right to choose things in life we can choose how we spend our time how we spend our money choose there's there's so many choices that he gives us the choice amen and and God is not going to violate that law of free choice Amen to make us move in a certain way amen but God is actually leaving that free choice intact to show what's in our heart amen because God wants to know what's in our heart and there's a certain kind of worship God wants and there's a certain kind of worship that's pleasing to God and there's another kind of worship that's not pleasing to God and so this whole law of free choice is set in place and God's not forcing us into things amen but he's he's allowing the circumstances to be as they are to see what's in our heart and what's in our heart can be pleasing to God brother REM says in the in the message the unwelcomed Christ he says he's worth he's worthy of the best what do you do for him give him the leftover oh yes you run around all day and give him three minutes at night before you go to bed he deserves your best friend he deserves everything you've got but what do you do about it you give him just anything he takes it he takes it anywhere anyhow he takes it but she said I want the best and he's referring to the woman who bought the alabaster box of ointment amen and she went into the and she went into the place that sells the perfume and the ointments and she wanted the very best that she could get and she said I want the best and it cost her everything she had to get the best that's what you you ought to do give your best to give your best give him the best of your life give him the best of your songs give him all your talent give him everything you've got give him your feet give him your hands give him your eyes give him your mouth give him your ears give him your soul give him your heart give him give him your praise give him everything you've got Hallelujah he's deserving of the best amen there's a you know when whenever you preach a message like this I want to be very very careful that I'm not preaching in a way that brings condemnation because that's not the point the point is not to make everybody feel bad because if we keep reading quotes and keep reading scriptures we can get very quickly to the point where every one of us including me feels bad because have we all given all all the time no is there more that we could give yes can we do better absolutely I don't know if there's anybody here that says brother Ted not me I've done everything that I possibly can do there's no more to give so we can preach in a way that that brings condemnation but that's not the point the point is what's in our heart amen what do we want to give God what is he looking for and how how can we be pleasing to him amen you know it's it's so wonderful when you when you catch that little vision of something that your spouse wants or one of your children would like or or a friend and and you you get a little insight into their heart and there's something you can do to bless them and you know how exciting it is to get it or do it or make a plan or there's something you know exactly what they want or something they would like to do or a place they'd like to go or and you and you can and you can do it for them what you're doing is expressing what's in your heart and what you're expressing is your attitude about that person what you think about them amen by the gift you give or the service that you render or what you do and it's not a treachery it's not it's not a condemnation it's not I mean it's not trying to do something Amen to get out of trouble it's not trying to do something just to gain something it's just a pure motive just to please somebody and that's the way that I desire to serve God I can't say that I'm always there but that's my desire My Desire is to serve God to please God I want to find out what pleases him I want to find out what he's satisfied with and I want to give it willingly from a heart amen by free choice not because I have to to make it to Heaven one thing the message has done is take away the fear of being lost amen take away the fear of not making the Rapture not the true revelation of this word and who you really are takes away the fear so that we're not serving God out of a fear of missing something or being left behind but now we can serve God from a pure heart yeah so the very Revelation amen brings us the ability to serve God out of a pure heart and that's what I want let's turn to Exodus chapter 35 together there's a theme that's running through this 35th chapter of Exodus and I want to follow it through and catch this theme God is now going to give Moses instructions he's already given him instructions on the building of the Tabernacle and he's going to be instructing Moses on collecting the material for the Tabernacle and they're going to build it but this is how he he he sets it up and this is the instructions he gives Exodus chapter 35 verse 4. and Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel saying this is the thing which the Lord commanded saying so he's repeating what the Lord has said take you from among you an offering unto the Lord whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring it an offering of the Lord gold and silver and brass so when God was going to give instructions on how to build a tabernacle because the Tabernacle and all the vessels they were going to be uh they were going to create a tent a tabernacle a place where God would dwell in the midst of Israel in the midst of the camp he was going to make his presence with them amen and so now he's telling them that they need to gather the materials to make this but he doesn't want forced worship he doesn't want you to be obligated in this offering Amen in this offering is to build a tabernacle where God will come and dwell right in the middle of their camp and he will make his presence with them but he says bring it of everyone that bringeth it with a willing heart amen let's keep going now let's go down to verse 20. and all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses and they came everyone whose heart stirred him up and everyone whom his Spirit made willing and they brought the Lord's offering to the work of the Tabernacle of the congregation and for all his service and for the holy garments and they came both men and women as many as were willing-hearted and brought bracelets and earrings and rings and tablets and all jewels of gold and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the Lord I think it's amazing it says everyone that whose heart stirred him up and everyone whom Spirit made him willing it didn't say everybody but everybody whose heart was willing and whose Spirit stirred him up or made him made his heart willing amen both man and woman everyone whose heart was willing came and brought an offering and it's amazing the offering they brought because what they brought very closely matches the spoil they took out of Egypt so when they left Egypt God told them to spoil their neighbors borrow from your neighbors amen garments and gold and jewels and vessels and all of these things and they put them upon their children they put them upon themselves and they left with the spoil of Egypt gold and earrings and bracelets and jewels and garments and all of these things they took out of Egypt it's amazing that God did not say he did not say carry these out for me and for the Tabernacle that I'll build later he said you spoil and they all carried out and it was theirs it was in their hand it was theirs and when God asked for an offering a free-willed offering for every heart that's willing he's not saying remember in Egypt when I gave you the Rings and the bracelets and all of these things I want them back no they're yours you can do whatever you want with them but what you do with them chose what you think about me you know how hard did they work for all those gifts how hard did they work for all the the gold and the silver that They carried out of there and God gave it to him it was all the grace and the mercy of God but God's not demanding for it to come back but God's giving them an opportunity amen for them to express what they think of God and about his plan to live with them and so everyone who's heart stirred them up and everyone was a willing heart they brought gold and they brought silver and they brought all of these things that God had given to them and it's just amazing God has given what what is it that we have that God hasn't given us the breath that we breathe in and out of our lungs is a gift from God our existence on this Earth our jobs our money and our houses are everything we have has come from God and God's not saying you have to do this and you have to do that no you you can do with all of that as you choose but what we do with all of our time and all of our resources amen indicates what we think about God and his plan to be tabernacled in this earth in this day and say God help me this is an area I need help in amen let's look at verse 29 now same chapter 35 verse 29. the children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses I tell you this is the way to serve God this is the way as a people to serve God of a willing heart if they came with a willing heart when their heart was stirred up they didn't come grudgingly they didn't come angry they didn't give but wish they didn't have to give they didn't they didn't give and talk about what a great sacrifice their giving was what what kind of sacrifice was it when God gave it to them amen and so many times our attitude about things about tithe and offering they just they indicate what we think about God they indicate what our attitude is towards God we think that we give our tithe amen and then we give an offering on top of that and we've done some great thing and we've given something to God to God Amen it's two minds it means it's not the amount of money he doesn't need money here's the cattle in a thousand hills it's not the amount of money that's given that does something for God but it's the Willing heart with joy amen doing something to please God because I know this pleases God because it's his word amen it's according to the word amen that he says test me try me bring an offering bring the tithe and see if I don't pour out a blessing amen God we know God is pleased with these things amen and so I don't have a thing I don't have a scent that I got myself all right so why why do I act like I've done God a favor by giving a tithe and an offering and talk about what great sacrifice that was what do you mean what sacrifice that was that was just I mean that was just an expression of God for giving me everything I've just given him a little bit amen I wish I could do more that's the attitude I want to have let's hold your place in Exodus slip your hand in there or bookmark but let's go over to the Gospel of John John chapter 14. John Chapter 14 verse 15. in John 14 and 15 Jesus says if you love me keep my Commandments it's such a simple little verse if you love me keep my Commandments what what Jesus is not talking about is you better keep my Commandments if you know what's good for you keep my Commandments if you want me to deal fairly with you no what he's saying is you can express your love to me by just obeying me like not it's so simple but it's not a it's not he's not talking about you have to you must you do it or else it's not any of that he's just making a statement if you love me keep my Commandments don't don't don't go try to do some wonderful thing that I never asked you to do don't put some major effort in the wrong place but if you love me just do what I told you to do that that's an expression of love amen not because you have to you do it or else you do it or you're contempting to hell I I was preaching one time and I think I mentioned some time ago that I've had conversations with people in the workplace and and conversations with different ones and you start to mention things out of the scriptures what God desires for a man and a woman how to conduct themselves how to dress and and things like that and how marriage should be and all of these things and sometimes they'll ask you the question well if if I don't do that will I go to hell and you think to yourself is what what are you talking about we just read the scripture we just talked about what God Said what his desire is or what a prophet has declared to be God's desire for our relationships for our families for us in church and you said well I mean is it a heaven or hell issue I don't want to live for a heaven or hell issue amen I want to live to please the Lord amen if it's pleasing to him I it doesn't it may brother Branham he said I can go fishing every day I can go down to the bank of the river and fish every day of my life and be just as saved as I am now the message is taken away the scare now there's no scare but now there's a desire to say Lord what's pleasing to you amen let's go over to First John now I want to read one more scripture then go back to Exodus first John chapter 5. verse 1. whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begotteth loveth him also that has begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous this word Grievous means heavy or or weighted or burdensome or severe for us the the things that God asked is not a heavy burden if it's a heavy burden it's displaying what's in our heart towards God it's not a burdensome it's not Grievous to us God doesn't give the Commandment to be burdensome or to be Grievous that's not the Commandment amen the Commandments are really for our good but but for us the Commandment is not Grievous or burdensome or severe to us it's a pleasure to know what's in his mind it's a pleasure to know what he desires I told you we'd go right back to Exodus but I want to read one more before that in first Samuel so we're working our way back that direction so let's go to First Samuel chapter 15. first Samuel chapter 15. and verse 22. first Samuel 15 and 22. and Samus said hath the Lord as great delight and burn offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams we know the story well it's Saul Saul is serving gone he's not obeying the full word of God he's doing his own thing making excuses that he's making a sacrifice to God and this is Samuel's response what does God rather want does he want to sacrifice an offering or does he want obedience what because it all comes down to showing what you think of God what it really gets down to is what what is my attitude towards God and what do I think about God it's not about commandment keeping for the sake of commandment keeping it's not about rule keeping for the sake of rule keeping or rule keeping for the benefit of rule keeping does that make sense because we say if I do all these things then then God's required to bless me I'm doing all these things for a blessing well you know God will bless you if you obey God will bless you but do his thing but that's not really what I want to display I don't want to serve God just for selfish reasons I want to serve God in my gratitude for God Amen I want to please him because I love him and because of what he's done for me I have a heart of gratitude and I want to find some way to express that heart of gratitude and so gone we can say you know I've done all these wonderful things but I think when it really comes down to it we realize we've done nothing what can I give what can I give to God what can I as a human being give God what gift can I give him what can I do for him amen he's God Amen he's the he's the god of the universe he's the creator of all things what can I give to God man this woman had a desire to serve Jesus Christ she was an ill-famed woman so she went and took all her living to buy this box of ointment this Alabaster Box amen and and God she was going to break it and pour it out on the feet of the one who who designed and created the tree that the box was made out of Amen who who designed and created the very the very plants that the perfume came from amen it wasn't that she was giving to something he didn't have or giving them something he needed it wasn't the perfume it wasn't the Box amen he created all the material it was made out of I mean he could get more at any time amen but what was pleasing to him was a heart that would give everything amen would catch the vision would catch the appropriate time to catch the season and catch who's in our midst and be willing to sacrifice everything for that [Music] I mean she this was Jesus Christ this was God and flesh this was the word for their day this was the message of the hour and he was sitting in Simon's house amen rejected unwelcome unworshiped unserved amen and here was a woman who would take what she had amen and do give everything to serve the word amen you see it was the rejection of Christ and the acceptance of Christ and she caught the anointing for the hour [Music] and she gave everything for that anointing amen he had to be anointed for his burial he had to be welcomed he had to be worshiped he had to be kissed his feet had to be washed all these things had to take place there had to be somebody that would fulfill that not by restraint amen not by force amen not by law but there had to be somebody that would catch the hour that they were in and by inspiration would be willing to give up everything to serve the word there's nothing different about her day than our day we're living in the same kind of circumstances amen and Jesus deserves to be worshiped his feet deserve to be anointed question is who's going to do it I think we'd be climbing over top of each other for the opportunity let me do it let me give all let I mean if we could have I mean Jesus Christ in his physical form sitting here in the front unwelcomed unkissed ungreeted unwashed amen and you knew about it and they said who wants to be the first one it would be a Mad Dash to the front amen but I'm telling you he's here amen and the person of the word amen and there's an opportunity to give all to worship him to give all to greet him and love him and serve him amen let's see it's a shame that we have to live in these bodies I hate living in this body we get so distracted and we get so caught up in the cares of life and we get so busy about other things and and and I mean the same thing happens in our relationships it happens in friendships it happens with spouses it happens with uh your children children to parents parents to children we can get Coast so caught up we let the more important things go get neglected and we let our relationship with our spouse sometimes gets a little neglected because we're busy with something or with our kids or with one another amen that's just life amen that's life but we have to be diligent about saying you know what there's some things more important they mend than whether or not I accomplish this task there's some things more important than whether or not I get a promotion or whether or not I get ahead in life amen I don't want to get ahead in this life I want to serve God and so we constantly need this checkup amen where we say listen it's important that I recognize that I'm easily distracted I mean maybe you're not but I'm easily distracted and and I want to constantly be readdressing where I'm at and not let life Carry Me Away but I want to recognize who's in our midst and what am I doing to declare what I think about Jesus Christ in our midst because that's the real that's really what we're getting down to what I do about this Christ in our midst declares what I think about Christ in our midst look at Exodus 36 now we're following in this vein we've been in Exodus 36 and we'll start at verse 2. and Moses called bezelil and the holy ebb and every wise-hearted man in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come into the work to do it and they received them Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary to make it with all and they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning and all the wise men that brought all the works of the sanctuary came every man from his work which they made and they spake unto Moses saying the people bring much more than enough for the service of the word which the Lord commanded to make and Moses gave commandment and Moses gave commandment and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp saying let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary so the people were restrained from bringing praise be to God this is the this is the result of a willing heart this is this is a people who God said I only want free will offerings I'm not requiring every household do such and such I'm not requiring you give me everything that came from Egypt I'm only asking you to give what you want to give amen and when their heart was stirred up to give they gave an abundance much more than was needed until the worker said you have to make them stop we already have more than what we need and the people were restrained from giving I say praise be to God let that be the attitude of the Bride of Jesus Christ so there's never a lacking in the service of God but there's always an abundance where there's always now this is enough this is enough Whoa stop we have enough amen praise be to God and that was the result of coming from a willing heart let's read verse 7 for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it and too much you know what if God had required of Moses to come out and said everybody has to do x y z there would have been everybody in the camp who was forced finding some little way to cheat or bring the minimum or interpret Moses said this I think he meant this but when the camp was stirred in their heart to give and gave willingly from a heart that wanted to give now they had sufficient and too much I think to me that's what God wants he's got everything but he drew attention to the Widow that gave all he drew attention to the to the Harlot who gave her whole living to anoint his feet what was he what was he showing us he wasn't showing us a repeat process now you just come Sunday morning empty all your bank accounts and dump everything in the offering box and no that's not what he's talking about he's not about just repeat what she did you take the attitude she had amen the spirit that she came in the willingness to give amen that's what God is looking for that's my desire to live that way amen and however God leads me whether we sell off or alabaster box of anointment are put all in the treasury or or do something else amen he he moved the Apostle Paul to give up everything and count everything he had as though it were done so that he might win Christ and give his whole life to preaching the gospel it wasn't it wasn't a mountain of Treasury it wasn't a melon Alabaster Box it was his life of service that he wanted from Paul and I want to give willingly let's turn to Luke chapter 17. like I said right from the beginning I feel so when I bring a message like this is stirring on my heart so cautious not to bring condemnation because that's not the point the point is we're talking about what we all want not not hammering down we didn't do good enough here we should do that and we're all you know we're we're all letting Leo to see a creep and we all know we're letting later see a creep in it's all around us it's knocking on our door it's penetrating every crack amen you leave the door open this month later to see us creeping in amen we know that amen we don't need somebody to pound us over the head and say you know you're not doing this and you're not doing it we we know full well amen what's around us and what we're subject to remember what we need to see is for somebody to say this is what's in the heart of the believer and for us to say that's what's in my heart that's what I want even when I fail that's what I want amen even when I look at the end of the day and said I've wasted time it wasn't what I wanted what I want is to give God everything I want to give him my best amen and I want to go from here not saying oh I should have done this and I messed up and I'm no good and I'm not a good believer but walk out the doors and say that's exactly what's in my heart God help me tomorrow to give my best help me tomorrow to give my all forgive me for what I've done but you've set my feet back on the course that's in my heart man amen you'll never get somebody you can get people to perform under threats you can get people to perform under rewards you can get there's all kinds of ways to get people to shape up and toe the line and all of that but God doesn't even want that what God wants is a willing heart amen somebody that serves him from a willing heart that's why he gave free choice and won't violate it because that's what he's looking for and so in the preaching we don't want to violate that we just we all know what condition we're in we all know that the age that we're stuck in we all know what's all around us you know brother Benham he was preaching the God of this evil age I don't have this quote so I'm just quoting by memory but he in the God of this evil age he's talking about he says Jesus is the God of this this age he said there's a God of this evil age and it's Satan he's the God of this evil age and he asked the question he says now has God lost control or is he allowed this for another purpose [Music] I mean you hear the news you look around you go to the store you drive down the street the question is has God lost control or has he allowed this for another purpose and then brother Brown tells us the purpose and God is evil age he said what is this evil age for this evil age is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve [Music] so you say why has God allowed it God has allowed everything that happened the evil wickedness of this age he's allowed it to prove you to Satan that you're not going to fall the way even no matter what device is in your pocket no matter how available entertainment is no matter how easy it is to take money and lavish it on yourself no matter what conditions are in the world today you're not going to leave the word amen not because somebody amen not because somebody's checking your accounts amen not because somebody's looking over your shoulder when you're on the phone amen you can go unchecked amen we're not creating we're not creating a a message search engine that's filtered amen it's all available everything is available it's at your fingertips it's in your pocket it's it's by every way that you can get it and keep it as private as you possibly could what's it for watch this evil age for it's to prove to Satan she's not like Eve she will stay with the word praise God Isaiah I wish he'd make it easier I wish he would stop he's not going to stop it he didn't want to make it easier what he wants to do is show what's in the heart of the believer and what we want so many times is for God to put restraints on us and lock us down and trap us in a in a dungeon and not let not let us fail I've prayed that many times God if you could just stop me if you could just I prayed so many times in the past a lot of you could just stop me where where I wouldn't but you know what it took a new birth and it took yielding to the Lord and growing in the Lord and my desires changing and staying yielded to that and in that atmosphere and environment and washing out all the desire for sin amen and it now you get to the point where God doesn't have to lock you in a dungeon God doesn't have to lock you away from the world he can sit you right in the middle of Satan's Eden and you're not going to fall like efell you're not going to leave this word yeah doesn't mean you're perfect and you won't make a mistake that's not what I'm saying the saying is you're not turning away from this word for any of the pleasures of the world [Music] so as God lost control or is he allowed it for another purpose how many times I wish my children didn't have to grow up with all the vileness all around them but they were born for this day too they were placed here intentionally I have to trust God that God knows what he's doing I wish my children didn't have to go to Walmart and see what they see in Walmart I wish they weren't exposed to the the things that they see and the things that they hear I wish they weren't but God knew they would be and God didn't lose control God allows another Force to take over to bring Satan's Ease Into The Pinnacle so that he can prove in my children that they're not going to go like evil and I have to have confidence in what God has done amen amen if not I'll live fearful all my life amen and we're not here Overcomers are not here to cower in the corner and live fearful but God has allowed it to show what's in our heart let's look here Luke 17. verse 7. but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he has come from the field go and sit down to meet and will not rather say unto him make ready we're with I'm a sup and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunken and afterward Thou shalt eat and drink does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him I trial not so likewise ye when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do my goodness we we do the minimum I went to church I read my Bible I paid my tithes and you could say I've done nothing because I'm yet an unprofitable servant because I only did that which was required God you know I don't think what we give God if I say I want to give to God I don't think minimal service is what I can give to God I think I can give more than just the minimum just what is required to be a believer I believe that I could please God by doing more than that brother Branham said in God's gifts always find their place this is where things started really connecting for me Sunday morning he said he said here there's only one gift that you can give and that is yourself give yourself to God because God's already give to you his gift now there's only there's only one thing you owe back to God that's yourself to him because of free choice because of free moral agency God has given you life and he's given you the the allowance to make choices in this life but what can I give to God when God has everything I can give him myself by choosing to give him myself let's look at Romans chapter 12. Romans chapter 12 and verse 1. it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so you know presenting our bodies a Living Sacrifice is our reasonable service it's not even extravagant service it's just reasonable service and God allows us to choose what will what will use our body for what we'll give our mind to and our time and energy he lets us make those choices amen but giving him our bodies is a Living Sacrifice is our reasonable service the prophet of God goes on to say in the same message God's gifts always find their places now God so anointed Jesus with the fullness of himself he was God's gift to the world that the wise men are clearly identified that they're offering their gift to him showed that in their heart they knew who he was and what he was going to do for them so no wonder the first thing they did they fell down perfectly in order and worshiped him before they could even understand it they fell down and worshiped him and then presented their gifts that's the way to have real Christmas worship him then present your gift presenting your body as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God what do we do we worship Him First We yield and surrendered to him to his word and then give our bodies to him as a Living Sacrifice that's the appropriate order and and brother Ben was saying in this message we listened to Sunday he was saying that the wise man's gift indicated that they knew who he was that they brought an appropriate gift for the one they were coming to worship they brought the gold the frankincense into myrrh speaking of his deity of his life of service and of his death and so their gifts were appropriate to the one that they were worshiping were and their gift declared who they believed him to be oh praise God I don't want to get ahead of myself but what we give God proves what we who we believe he is and what we think about him that's why I've said so many times and I'll say it over and over again I I care little for what comes out of somebody's mouth when their life is totally contrary to what they speak so many people talk about how much they love God but they will not do the basics to surrender their life to serve him they won't even do the basis I mean like the basis of just coming to services consistently paying tithes uh testifying of of God not even the basis but there's all kinds of I love God and I just love God so much and I'm I'm just loving God he said if you love me keep my Commandments it was so simple amen so the the love that kind of love is is a different kind of love amen it's still that self-centered love I love God but I don't love him enough to die to myself I don't love him enough to sacrifice for him it's really I love The God Who will do something for me amen but I want to have the kind of love where I love the god the God where I want to do something for him so brother bam says Grace is what God does for you works is what you do for God it's Grace that brings you to God it's Works to you do for God he says in the message the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's why we different with the Baptist the methodists and so-called calvinistic people but Calvinism is right then we're going to come over on the Armenian side what did they get works that's the Holiness group bless God I'll let my hair grow out the women say oh praise God I won't even wear a short sleeve shirt the men will say so forth like that that has nothing to do with the kingdom no sir you can let your hair grow long you can wear dresses whatever you want to or you can do this or do that or the other and it won't have nothing at all to do with it you're not saved because of your clothes it's God would just have made some patterns of such Jesus wouldn't have to had to die so he's saying if you could just get saved by doing the the the the works then Jesus wouldn't even have to die you could just do the works you're saved because that God saved you by grace and you do those things just in appreciation so important that's so important to note that that if we're not serving God just out of appreciation then we're serving for merit or for reward or for whatever but we've already been given everything from before the foundation of the world he's already purchased Amen in God's mind it was a finished work and you were sealed in the book before the foundation of the world you were on the marriage certificate before you ever realized it so it's not that I'm trying to do something to get my name on The Book of Life amen now I realize what he's done for me in my works as an appreciation for what he's done so then if that be the case I guess the way we live our life shows how much we appreciate God and you do these things just in appreciation common decency will tell you that you do those things in appreciation works is what I do for God if I never preach another sermon and live here 150 years I'll still be saved sure I'm not saved because I'm a preacher I'm saved because it's God it's the grace of God that saved me there wasn't one thing I could do to Merit it so now it's not serving God for merit or for reward but I want to get down to the pure motive of appreciating him and I want him to know how much I appreciate him I'm not even talking about things that other people see because that's not what we're interested in anyways I'm not here to let you know how much I appreciate him because if I do that then I still want you to recognize me that's still selfish I mean that's how the Pharisees serve God they stood on the corners they brought in their phylacteries they gave loud prayers so that everyone and Jesus said they have the reward they got what they wanted I don't want to serve God to be appreciated by you I don't want to serve God to be recognized so that you'll say oh brother Chad he's a real Saint he's a real child of God Amen if that's the motive if I'm doing it for somebody else to see and acknowledge then I'm still doing it for me but what about the things nobody sees what about your private conversations the sacrifices you make that you don't blow a trumpet and talk about the times you keep quiet when you could have spoken the times when you turned when nobody knew you turned your head nobody knew you kept quiet amen only God knows what you did for him only God knows the extra time you spent in prayer only God knows how you've interceded for somebody who wanted to do you wrong only God sees that amen and it's a service to God and appreciation for him it's praising him and the quietness in my prayer closet and telling him how much I love him not for anybody else's ears to hear it's not not for show not to impress anybody but just to love God back brother Benham said in the message dedication he says you can see the Psalms how David is constant thinking of God too many of us today think of our own achievement something that we could do to better ourselves but David was constantly thinking what he could do for God I think that's amazing statement he was constantly he he got his house built and he was in peace all around and he said I live in a house of Cedar but the Ark dwelleth in the Tabernacle of curtains and he wanted to build a house for the Lord he was constantly thinking of what he could do for God when he failed he's he's crying out in Psalms 51 he says oh Lord open now my lips and my mouth shall show forth praise for thou desire is not sacrifice else would I give it he's saying what can I give what can I give to repay what Can I Give he says doubt doesn't desire sacrifice else would I give it thou delightest non-burn offering the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit are broken and a contrite heart oh God thou will not despise what was it God wanted God wanted a true repentant heart that was sorry for failing God not sorry I got caught sorry I'm in trouble but sorry that I failed God what did God want God wanted something that was real he wanted genuine worship real worship God wanted something real praise God let's look at Isaiah 29 together Isaiah 29. in verse 13. Isaiah 29 and 13. wherefore the Lord said for as much as his people draw near me with their mouth and with her lips to honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men God was not pleased with this what did he want and he wanted them to worship from their heart not by rules not by fear of man not by the the rule of the day not by the peer pressure or the group he wanted he wanted God wanted a man to love him back into worshiping again in the message God's gifts always find their places he said and I say that to us today the things that we bring to him identifies what our thoughts is about him I want you to pay close attention to this quote the the things that we bring to him the Christ identifies what our thoughts is about him you understand what I mean see if you believe it with all your heart every word of that you'll identify it by giving all that you have to it was he talking about he's talking about the word he's talking about the message now let's bring this home let's talk about Christ in our day the message of the hour he says what you what what you bring to him identifies your thoughts about him if you believe it with all your heart every word of that you identify it by giving all that you have to it if we believe that this message is the truth we'll give our whole life to it not part of our life not the religious section of our life for the church part of our life but we'll give all of our life to it our private life our thought life our family life our work life all of our life will give to this message if we believe it to be true and what we give amen indicates what we think about him because brother bear said this message is Christ amen it's not tapes it's not books it's not sermons by a man this message is Christ it's the identified Christ of this age and if we believe that then we'll automatically give our whole life to it amen it's an automatic response by believing it but if you find that there's a there's a there's a little hold back somewhere in life there's a little doubt about this being Christ it's just the truth he said he goes on to say but if you believe it's a good place to associate with better people I I I just marvel at this statement if you believe it's a good place to associate with better people around church and things like that that's just about what you give just a few social hours with some of the congregation or something but if you really believe it with all your heart then you'll give everything that's in you to it and it I it identifies you that you are truly believe the message that you believe it to be the truth if we're if we are message Believers in church Association then it shows what we believe about the message but if we believe that this is Christ Jesus then we'll give our whole life to it then it doesn't matter if there's anybody from the church around or not because I don't need anybody around from the church for me to serve God because I know what this message is I don't need other people Amen to support me I don't need somebody else to tell me if I'm right or wrong or I don't need to change my conduct whether somebody's watching or not because if that's if I'm changing my conduct whether somebody's watching or not then what's happening is I'm indicating what I believe about this message that it's a church thing that it's a group thing amen now trust me I'm not talking about being careful not to stumble a brother somebody has a conviction and you be careful and that's not your conviction I'm not talking about any of that I'm talking about actually conducting yourself differently in front of different people then you realize I have the wrong revelation of this message it's time to be I think it's just time to be real it's time to be honest with where we at and who we are and what we believe amen and if we find ourselves lacking say God Amen I believe help down my unbelief God I need a greater Revelation amen because I find in myself I want to give more I need to give more I need to see who you really are amen the Apostle Paul he was willing to give up everything because he believed the message of his day he gave up he he tells us in the book of Philippians amen I I if anybody has a right to boast I have a right to Gloria I'm of The Tribe of Benjamin a Pharisee of the Pharisees taught in the school and all of these things but he ends up saying I counted it all is done then I might win Christ I've given it all up because he's become my greatest treasure and he believed the pillar of fire he believed what Christ taught him and he proved it by giving his whole life to it Paul did not preach to become popular do you believe false reached for popularity do you believe he preached for money for power Paul preached because he loved God he preached this message because he loved loved God and brother Branham preached this message because he loved God he didn't do it for popularity he didn't do it for anything other than he loved God and in loving God he loved God's people and he served God by preaching this message he didn't do it for power he didn't do it for popularity he didn't do it for profit because he didn't get any of that but what did he do he gave his whole life and do you believe the prophet gave his whole life to this message he gave his whole life to this message he gave up his health his time his energy he gave it all to the word Paul did the same thing Moses did the same thing their conduct proved their faith and I want my conduct to prove my faith I want to be a genuine believer all the time and I want to give all my heart and all my life to this word and when I find myself distracted I want to repent say God forgive me for being distracted forgive me God for getting caught up in this little thing and caught up in that little thing and God I recognize that's not what I'm on this Earth for forgive me God and help me keep pressing amen that's what that's what I want to do that's what I want to give God I want to give myself to him it's the only gift that we can give is ourself and he's given us the free choice to make our choices amen and I want to choose him whether Ram goes on and God's gifts always find their places he says now notice now the same is now they rejected identified deity do you get it they will certainly put their name on a church book and say I'll try to live by this Creed they'll take an oath by this but when it comes to accepting deity and expressing back the same kind of gift that you are identified by your gift I I can't express this enough I don't know how to express it that you're identified by your gift you're saying well well I'm what are you what am I giving you're identified by your gift so if we're not giving all we're identified by our gift amen so what we're giving if we're giving to the one who is all we should give all and in giving all identifies what we think about the one we're giving to and it identifies us so you are identified by your gift the Magi were identified by their gift the the gift identified that they had a revelation of who this was in the manger their gift identified they knew the message they had the Revelation and what they gave identified what they believed and now what we give identifies what we believe if we give Sunday and Wednesday and some tithe and offering it I didn't that's it it identifies what we believe it identifies what we believe about who this is in our midst but if we give every day and we give our thoughts and we give our private time and we give the best of everything it identifies who what we think about who's in our midst and it identifies who we are that we are a genuine believer amen you are identified by your gift that you give that you that you give your entire being to it to identify deity what are we giving our our entire self to he said you give your entire being to identify deity what am I giving my entire being to a set of Doctrine some tapes no to identify deity this is identified the Mighty God this is this message is identified deity I'm not giving myself to a church program I'm not giving myself to a movement I'm not giving myself to a set of doctrines I am giving my whole being to identify deity and identify deity as worth of everything I've got and my gift identifies me then now this way says next then you identify yourself with the deity by giving all you are what you are to deity himself now Christ in this day that we now live in is is identifying himself deity among the people he's still deity because he is the word and when we see the word living itself then we know that man can't do that it's deity the word being made manifest by man and Jesus said himself the son can do nothing in himself I can't do nothing I'm a man Jesus said but my father that dwelleth in me he showeth me all things that himself doeth amen there you are what is it deity being identified in man now the same thing is today that deity the promised word for this day can identify itself in you then can you hold to it show that you believe in it give it deity believe it service and be ready to die out to yourself and your thoughts but today it's rejected as it was then this is identified deity in our midst but is it accepted as deity brother said in the message it is the rising of the Sun so is it today we don't try to be some big person we don't care what the people say about us our name ain't nothing but it's his name our life is nothing it's his life it's his power not our power and there's only one thing that we love to do is to see him glorified I believe with all my heart that's the way Paul lived I believe that's the way Moses lived and that's the way brother Branham lived is not to bring any attention to himself but to give his whole life to be to see Christ glorified and I think that's what we want is to give our whole life to see Christ glorified not our Glory his glory and how can it be when he's glorified in Us by his resurrection that's in US we see him represented again as he was today did you get that see our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not some big name our desire is not to boost some church or make more in Sunday school or try to bring in hogtie push in offer a picnic party or bring Stars buttons or something else like that that's not our desire our desire is to see him glorified glorified not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive in living in US so how is he going to be glorified when he's glorified in us how is he going to be glorified in us when we give him everything he can't be glorified if we're not giving him everything but if we give and yield everything to him and surrender everything to the word then the word can live in us and then deity can be glorified in us and we live not so that we are glorified so that he's glorified in US [Music] so we have to get rid of us so that he can come in us so that he can be glorified in US not us him in US how's it going to happen when I give him everything listen what he says next if I can get myself out of the way so when William Branham not even thought of and you're not even thought of until we can see Jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire and now this is the last quote that I want to read God's gifts find their place he says tonight let me take him as my savior to my heart let me walk in the face of my death or whatever it is like that I promised my life to him I want to take it to him programs makes a statement when he's talking about the little on the street remember from Sunday little on the street he wanted to buy his little daughter a doll she cried for a doll and she died and he wanted to take that doll to her and he walked the streets with his little doll in his heart and he wanted to get it to her and the only way he could get it to her was to die and God wanted to get a gift to us and the only way he could get it was for him to die but now we want to give a gift back to him and the only way to give it to him is to die it's the same thing all over again he died to bring a gift to us now I want to give a gift back to him but the only way that I can give this gift to him is I must die to self and if I die I can get the gift through he said I promised my life to him I want to take it to him no matter what I have to go if I have to go through death if I have to be shot no matter what it takes takes place if I have to be laughed at called crazy everything s communicated from the rest of the Christian churches and so forth it's a gift of God that I hold in my heart he gave it I want to take it to him what is it it's the seed of Faith it's the life that he's planted inside of me and he's quick and amen by his holy spirit coming inside and there's a gift that he placed in me that I want to give back to him but I can only take it to him if I die I said God help me to die and to give everything to you it's not this isn't this isn't a message that we're preaching to to try to get somebody to shape up or make you pay tithes or make you come to church more often amen that's inconsequential amen I mean it matters it does matter but you can come to church every service and pay all your tithes and be as lost as lost can be amen this is a message for all of us to say I want to Fan those flames of that desire that's inside of me and I want to rekindle that desire to give him everything because that's the only way that he can be glorified in this day is when he's glorified in his bride and if that bride is giving partial and holding back some and still with selfish desires and wants to be glorified and known as being spiritual or known as being righteous and she has all of these things going on Amen he's not going to be glorified he'll be the deity amongst us that's rejected why because of self this isn't about a church anymore this is about me as an individual is he welcome here amen is he come to my house and my invitation and is he going to sit here with unwashed feet or am I going to be like the little Harlot when he comes into this house will I sell out all to give him the best offering that I have I want to be the one who gives all I want to be the one promised in my life and I want to take it to him but I've got to pass through the doors of death to self and unfortunately that's not a one-time event I wish that I could die to myself once and then I got it over with go to the chopping block of self-will and have my head caught off but it's dying daily Paul said I Die daily and I want to Die daily to keep giving this gift to him willingly out of a desire out of my heart willingly because that's what I want more than anything is to see him glorified Cain and Abel were going to bring an offering Cain was going to bring a gift to God an offering to God Abel was going to bring an offering to God so Cain through self-will worship he gave God what he thought God wanted and what he gave looked nice and what he gave made Cain look nice because Cain brought a beautiful offering you know the beautiful offering made the one offering it look beautiful there's so many things when we get down to the heart of it there's so many things that we as human beings do to make us look good Cain his offering made Cain look good Abel was going to give a different kind of offering he was going to give an offering that pleased God and the only way to give an offering that would please God is he would have to die to everything he thought about what God wanted and wait for God to tell him what he wanted reveal it by Revelation and then just give God what God wanted with nothing extra when nothing lasts with nothing more but just to give God what he wanted but listen we're back in the same place today oh my goodness there's religious Spirits floating around all over the place amen and they're all around you and I amen so don't think they're somewhere else amen we can keep giving what makes us look good and look like Believers and say the right thing and look good or we can say I want to bring an offering by a genuine Revelation because I know who this is in this hour because he's revealed to me what he wants and what he wants is my life not my not just my money not just some time on Sunday and Wednesday he wants me because that's the plan and this day is to live in people so what does he want not a few hours a couple times a week a few dollars that come out of a paycheck that's not what he wants what does he want it's a revelation of what's going on in this day is going to require amen what we give indicates what we believe out of this message if I believe that this message is what God did through William Branham then I'm going to keep talking about what God did and how wonderful it was and all the wonderful things and I believe in the prophet and I'll keep living for self thinking everything's fine but what God wants in this day he got what he wanted in that day but what he wants in this day is a bride that he can pour himself completely into and she will be so much like him she will be him that's the that's the revelation of this hour Christ in you the hope of glory and you don't get there with a partial with a halfway with holding back for self so when it comes down to it amen when it comes down to it we've got to look at our lives and say what do I believe about this message and does my gift match my revelation it's a good question to ask ourselves and say Lord help me help me God give me eyes to see give me a heart to perceive all that you're doing in this hour and Lord let me die to my own self-will and self-designed and help me get my gift through to you by carrying it in my heart and dying to self to bring this gift is that your desire but would you stand with me I know it's your desire I know what you desire that's why there's no there's no desire in me to go through a million examples and and show how all the ways that we found we know how we fail not the brow beater cause you to look bad or or make everybody raise your hand if you failed this week it's a hundred percent participation in the hand raised I don't want any of that but what I want to do is keep preaching this gospel so that it inspires us to keep pressing on to keep dying out to keep giving more because it's the only thing that'll work in this day is a 100 sell out to the pure revelation of the world no partial is going to work anymore it's going to take everything but it's not going to take everything by coercion it's not going to take everything by a strong personality or dominance it's going to come by a free will offering what does God want for this Tabernacle for him to dwell in he wants us to give everything he's given to us which is our life to give back to him in a free will offering what did you do to give yourself life both natural and eternal nothing he's spoiled Egypt to give you life now he's asking for you to give that life back to him but only those whose Hearts stir them to give an offering willingly not by Church order not by Church rule not by preaching the message so hard that you're scared to death to do something wrong I don't want you to be scared at all I don't want you to be one ounce fearful I want I want there to be an atmosphere where everybody has the freedom to express what's the deepest desire of their heart and that's what I want to come out if that's what comes out there'll be more than enough there'll be more than enough there'll be everything God needs to finish the work in this day I want to give him all because I want to give him all I want to show my appreciation for him by dying to myself I want to either die to myself today I want to die to myself tomorrow and I want to keep dying to myself and keep surrendering more and more what can you give somebody who made it all who created the heavens and the Earth and has everything just give it's not so much what you give but how you give how did the two mites please the Lord how did the alabaster box appointment please the Lord how did Abel's offering please the Lord how will your offering please the Lord is when you give willingly from a willing Heart by Revelation and you surrender to his desire for this hour say God help us all men are musicians if you'd come please let's bow our heads together oh Lord Jesus God I've poured out what you put in my Heart Lord God no doubt that the human element keeps it insufficient I'm not able to express all that's in my heart but Lord there's a supernatural element at work and by that Supernatural element of your spirit through the foolishness of preaching do heart surgery in US Lord now go down into the crevices and the nooks and crannies of our hearts Lord and expose those places where we have to die help us Lord to have our desire to give willingly of our whole selves God do the work that only your word Can Do Lord no human can do it no human effort can do it but God you have a power that's here it's the power of your word you've opened the word to us in this hour to change everything God help us to give more of ourselves than we've ever given before and father I ask that you forgive me Lord forgive me for the distractions forgive me Lord for the for the foolishness that I allow sometimes forgive me for the waste of time and the waste of energy I'm sorry Lord but I pray God as I surrender to you I pray God you would help me give me more I save that I can see more clearly that I might yield in a greater way and that you can do things through a yielded vessel that I never could imagine and I have no strength for on my own but Lord may you declare your deity and flesh through a surrendered vessel and may it be for your glory and for yours alone while we give ourselves to you afresh we ask that you'd have your way bless your people Lord May the word that you've given us today may have hit home Lord May It Strike the court it was intended to strike man go to the place you intended for it to go and May It Go like a seed in good ground and may it bring forth a Bountiful Harvest for God you alone know why you do things the way you do you know why you have things said the way they're said and I'm completely trusting in you Lord to do the work God and our little Minds we can't comprehend but Lord we trust you God do a work in each one of us Lord let us bring an offering that's pleasing to you acceptable in your sight a free will offering of our desire to please you we love you Lord we ask your blessing over us as we go guide our Steps step by step Lord as we lift our feet may you put them down in the very center of your will May every step we take in every path we walk May It Be Your choosing May It Be by your leading and may you get glory in it all we love you we surrender ourselves afresh to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen remember the bin Lord I Want to

dispensation in this body of Flesh this is why my one shot at this Earthly existence to please him and to give him all right that's what I want to do I think it's so good for us to recognize we're still growing we're still changing we're still growing into his likeness and becoming more like him day by day the Journey's not done yet we're still in the journey and may we keep pressing forward may God bless you just keep loving him with all of your heart we'll get there friends we keep surrendering and keep loving keep putting him first and when we find that we have it repent and put him first again we're going to make it there we've been predestinated to make it there it's not that we won't we're going to we have to keep recognizing I can't let this world distract me I I can't let the cares choke me out I've got to keep going back and saying God I'm putting it all aside for you it's a healthy healthy thing to do and God bless you all to sing this again as we're dismissed oh
