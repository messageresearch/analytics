TRANSCRIPT
========================================
remember how brother brandham tells us that the only real Sin there is is unbelief said unbelief in what unbelief in the word of God what did they have what did these spies have in the rest of the nation when they rose up in a bitter cry amen at the at the at the testimony of the the 10 false Witnesses amen they they cried out and wanted to go back to Egypt and all that amen they they they were cut out he was displeased with them because they provoked him in the wilderness by what by not believing his promised word when they come face to face with it they did not believe it amen and so now they were kept out of the promise who was kept out of the promise those that didn't believe now now listen close this is what I want to drive down to it wasn't the ones who were vile and wicked and nasty and had a temper and and didn't always do what Moses said he cut them out because they were hard to deal with that wasn't how he differentiated who went in and who didn't go in and he didn't he didn't take Joshua and Caleb because they were always nice to their neighbor and they said sweet things and they took care of their mom really well he that's that was never the differentiating point that was not the deciding factor but it came down to the basis of faith and unbelief the separation line was faith and unbelief amen that the the the whether you went in or not who didn't go in those that didn't believe what didn't they believe they didn't believe this portion of the word there was others they could claim to believe there was others they acted and participated in but they didn't accept this truth that God God was going to give that land to them when they saw all the unsurmountable odds and they provoked God unto wrath amen and he rejected them and he said they're not going to go in they will not go in and they everyone died in the wilderness but there was two who went in not because they were nicest and better looking and more intelligent that wasn't the basis the basis for them entering in when the others were rejected is because said if God beest were more than able they're but bread for us cuz we believe what Moses said all the way back in Egypt come from God and it's nothing but the truth those are the two that went in it's not Good Conduct amen it's not bad conduct it's faith and in belief in the promised word of God and when I say that I feel like I have to qualify my statements because the more people hear you say something the more questions you have listen it doesn't mean that you're not going to have righteous acts and righteous Deeds amen that's the outcropping of Faith amen if you have faith genuine faith in the word of God you will obey the word of God and when you get off the word of God you'll repent and come back in line with the word of God understand we're not saying act any way you want you're going to go in any ways that's fine no that's a very clear indication that you don't believe the word of God if you trample over it so lightly and esteem it so little but conduct is not the basis faith is the basis
