So, I just uh told brother Chad, he called me this morning and said, "Yeah, I'm happy to be here, but still there's a portion that is vacuum because you're not around." Uh, amen. But really appreciate the trust and confidence. you know, pastors are the most suspicious personalities in the church, you know, but uh I really feel uh being trusted and uh so this is a family for me. Amen. Uh so we're just so glad to uh uh so I bring greetings from my family, my congregation. Uh Ber Dondon just preached in our church and he send greetings to you as well. Amen. and and all the ministers that are associated with uh this little ministry that the Lord has entrusted us. Uh Amen. Uh they all send greetings. Amen. So God bless you, brother Brian, the family. Amen. Of course, uh children of brother Chad, I saw brother Garner in the in the audience. So thanks for the Holopul family for taking good care of me and the the rest of the brethren. All of you, we love you. And uh uh so it's just a wonderful experience and of course I'm excited because this evening we will be hitting the road all the way to the airport uh because I don't want to be nervous tomorrow. I'm flying back home to Manila mid uh midday tomorrow. So it's better to stay in the airport rather than getting nervous on the way to the airport. Amen. So uh all right. So I see sister Marty in the uh audience this morning but the Lord is leading me in this direction. We uh we we met in Phoenix. So this is part two of what uh uh the Lord has placed in my heart. Okay. So uh let's read directly from uh the Bible from the scriptures. Uh so we would like to speak something about the daughters of the firstborn. Amen. Uh and uh we have subtitle on that the bride's battle for inheritance. Amen. And just the Lord will uh give us some kind of inspiration and encouragement of uh this part of the scripture in the Old Testament. Let's read from the book of uh numbers uh chapter 27. Amen. In the book of numbers chapter 27 we read uh uh so in verse one then came the daughters of cilopihad the son of heer the son of Gilead the son of Makir the son of Manasse of the families of Manasse the son of Joseph and these are the names of his daughters Mala Noah and Hogla and Mila and Tiraza And they stood before Moses and before Elazar the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation saying, "Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora, but died in his own sin and had no sons. Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family? Because he hath no son. Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father. And Moses brought their cause before the Lord. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, The daughters of Zilopiad speak right. Thou shalt surely, Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. And if he has no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. And if he has no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it, and it shall be unto the children of Israel, a statute of judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses. Amen. Let's all bow our heads in prayer. Dear heavenly father, we thank you for this wonderful day that you have given us. And Lord, there's nothing we can say except you speak through this mouth, Lord. And we need revelation from you. That is something that steers our faith to keep us moving, to keep pressing on. And so I uh really appreciate Lord uh to stand behind this pullpit with the full trust and confidence. Amen. For the man that you have ordained uh uh in this assembly Lord. So we commit everything Lord into your mighty hands as we give you Lord glory and the honor in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. And everybody say amen this morning. Hallelujah. God bless you. Amen. You may be seated. Uh so as we made mention would like to speak about uh the daughters of the uh the firstborn. Amen. So you see uh the uh the the name the name Zilopead amen is uh uh actually meaning firstborn. Zilopead means firstborn. So, and he has five daughters in this story. He has five daughters. And let me put the first quote here. Uh when brother Brandham was uh uh beyond the curtain of time and he had uh such a awesome experience and he said there's nothing like it. Amen. It's there's no amount of words to describe the the dimension the realm that the Lord placed him. And uh I believe uh uh I know of Paul uh being translated also in that real Amen. And uh uh Paul is like a father to us also in faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he's the father to his generation. And at the same time in this generation, the Lord sent us a messenger, &gt;&gt; a prophet. &gt;&gt; Who is also uh uh as Paul said, I have begotten you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the same thought, the same statement was also quoted by brother Brandham referring to this age. He said, "I have begotten you." Amen. Through this gospel and I am your children. Amen. So that's why we are offspring. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are all offsprings of this message of the hour. Amen. We are being birthed. Amen. By this message of the hour. Amen. And as uh so uh beyond the curtain of time, there was there was a voice and and the voice said, "Amen." Well, this is perfection. said, "This is like the patriarchs when they gathered with their people." He said, "This is after that." Yes. I turned and looked back. There was still laying on the bed and he said, "This is after that." And said, "Oh, then I've died." Well, this is wonderful. This is good for me to be here. I like this. So, it's good to die. Amen. But it must be on God's time. Of course. Amen. So uh uh of course we know that brother Bham didn't die but he was he was transported into that real Amen to be a witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be uh uh to be also the firstborn of this age. Amen. And I said well I can understand. I say all these broms. So he was thinking in his heart. Amen. So he he was with his family. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Are are these Branhams?" Amen. Look like millions of them. &gt;&gt; I said, "All these Branamites?" No. All these Branhams, Amen. No. They said that boy said they are your converts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Meaning they are the result of your ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are the fruit of the message of the hour. They are your converts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, but we we of course we understand that. Amen. It's not brother Benham who converted us. It's the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Christ who has converted us in this generation. Amen. So from that point of view, Amen. From that point of view, Amen. Zilopiad being the father and he had five children. Amen. And Paul in his generation, he said he's going to present his his converts in his generation and all through the ages. Amen. All the messengers in its age. Amen. They were uh h uh uh they were the undersheperd in their generation. They're messengers. And and the message tells us that in every age the messenger is but an example for that age. So that means whatever whatever the messenger experience whatever God reveals to that messenger in the age and the day and age that they are living in it is in the same measure. It is in the same pattern. Amen. And it will produce the same result. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will produce sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now let's see. So we we we uh we get that. So from that point of view, so he is Copied is the father and and he had five daughters. All right. So let's read in numbers 27:1. He said, "Then came the daughters of Zilopiad, the son of Heer, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasse, of the families of Manasse, the son of Joseph. And these are the names of his daughters. Mala, Noah, and Hogla, and Mila, and Tarsa. And they, it gives me uh a reminder of the five wise virgins. Amen. And you know what the five wise virgins are? Amen. They type the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh they have the full measure. Amen. They had they had that extra oil for the extra journey. Amen. And uh uh uh uh that speaks about amen that speaks about amen the Holy Ghost in their generation and the Holy Ghost has something to do amen with the with the with the word of God in the day and age that we are living in. So that means the Holy Spirit amen will lead us into all truth. Amen. And this all truth will bring us amen to the pardonance of the gospel in this generation that the denominations cannot meet. Amen. Because &gt;&gt; uh uh uh they missed the oil in this age that we are living in. Hallelujah. And this is this is the journey. Amen. And I believe everything that we have need of in this earthly journey is all in the message that we have heard. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we are we are feasting on that. So now uh we have we have seen now if zilopiad means daughter or or uh the firstborn. Now look at the definition the meaning of the names amen of his daughters. Number one mahala means forgiven. uh in other uh terms it call it it's it's it's disease because uh uh Zopiad the Bible said he died in his own sin but look at the eldest daughter it means forgiven &gt;&gt; hallelujah so I believe this uh not this is this is not an accident &gt;&gt; amen soiad and his wife back then were inspired by the Lord. Amen. Because uh uh he was a normal person. Uh uh so he died in the wilderness. But so the meaning amen of his first daughter Mala means forgiven. But now in this generation we understand that we are not just forgiven. &gt;&gt; We are being justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh and Noah Noah means uh movement uh and a movement has something to do with a campaign or uh some kind of a revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So some uh so uh uh that means Noah is has something to do with an attraction. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, it's a movement. It it's a that that that there's a a certain direction that uh uh uh it it it is creating some kind of attention or attraction. So that is what this message is all about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now remember the first time you have heard that you were not just forgiven but you were justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means everything that we have done before is not just forgiven but everything was thrown in God's sea of God's forgetfulness and he remembers it no more &gt;&gt; as if you have not done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God don't remember. There is no record on file. And if you when we got that kind of revelation, oh we want to jump. We want to there is something in us that has been steered &gt;&gt; because in our own way we cannot make it &gt;&gt; in our way own way. We cannot go back to God. Amen. But thank God he justified us through his blood. He justified us. Amen. And so then after a while so the the the first experience the first feeling is for us. Amen. To get revived deep inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why when when this uh historian during the the Welsh revival that brother Brana made mention he said you know uh they were looking they went to a certain place they went to wells and they they were looking for a place. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were searching and they were asking every person where is that wells revival and they come across with with a man a policeman. Amen. Yeah. whistling and uh rolling his, you know, walking around. Amen. And and then they asked him, "Amen. Do you know, can you lead us? Do you know where that Wells revival is?" He said, "Huh? Well, revival." Amen. You know, he did not point them to a certain place. &gt;&gt; He did not point them to any geographical location. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revival, you look at me. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're just looking right into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the same thing. I'm looking right into it. That's a real revival. Amen. People who have, you know, you've been changed. Amen. Uh uh something deep inside of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is rejoicing because we found out that we are being justified. Then something has taken has come out of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we have reason to rejoice. We have reason to come to the church. We have reason to spend time. Amen. Uh listening for this message. this day and and and we we don't get tired &gt;&gt; going to church fellowshipping regardless you know uh how much time we spend fellowshipping we love him why what do you call that you're looking at it &gt;&gt; amen so that's mean that's the meaning of the the word Noah amen and then next to that mila mila means queen Praise &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Where is the bride sitting? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride is sitting with him in his throne. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And actually, we're not looking uh into that time in the future. &gt;&gt; We are right now sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the bride, no one, no one sits beside the king except the queen. &gt;&gt; So that is our position. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the bride's position. Amen. Being the queen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember uh uh queen Esther. &gt;&gt; King Asiru said, "Que Esther, you are my queen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak. Just say what you want &gt;&gt; and you're going to have it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know if you're the queen, King Asu said, I can give you even half of my kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is the position of the queen. And you know the uh when when you say I can give you half of my kingdom uh it does not literally means 5050 &gt;&gt; that there is boundary. Amen. I am the king so I own uh up to this this border &gt;&gt; and you are the queen. &gt;&gt; That's your border. That's not it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you are the queen, I can give you even half of my kingdom. That means you have the equal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What he owns, &gt;&gt; you own. &gt;&gt; It's not half. &gt;&gt; Amen. But everything. That's why. Amen. If we know that we own what he owns, we surrender all. &gt;&gt; Amen. We do not reserve anything. That's like husband and wife. There is no more reservation between husband and wife. Amen. Because what the husband possess, the wife possesses also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you know your position this morning that you are the queen, you own what he owns. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we're not afraid. &gt;&gt; Amen. To ask anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't be like that small BTPs in the Pacific Ocean who's not who's so afraid. Oh, I can reserve. I cannot, you know, I have to drink a little bit because maybe sometime in the future I will. No, we're just little bitty piece. Amen. In the property of the king, brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. Amen. So that is, you know, you have the share to the throne. Amen. Because you're the queen. That's the position of the bride. And tearsa means pleasing. &gt;&gt; Godraise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you uh people wonder, you know, uh we're we're we're not after the physical appearance whatsoever. But people from the outside sometimes, you see, she's so beautiful. How come [Laughter] she choose this, you know? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know it's not only love is blind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know your bride the bride is the apple of the eye of the husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's why I told sometimes you know in the morning it doesn't matter what kind of pride egg you have &gt;&gt; your wife present on the table. Amen. You always say praise the Lord. This is the best egg for the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Although although it was different from what it was presented yesterday. Amen. Sometimes it's you know it's medium, sometime it's overcooked but that is the best for the day because it is your bride's presentation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there is nothing wrong in the bride through the eyes of the husband. Amen. It happened way back in Genesis. &gt;&gt; It continued on until today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride remains the apple of the eye of the bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ. Aren't you glad this morning? Amen. So, hogla means circling, dancing, worshipper. So, though for this reason it is also the word, Amen. It's it's it means partridge. Amen. So it's worship. Hogla means worship. So serving the Lord, worshiping is part of our worship is part of our service to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I like that line. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let our lives continue to worship him. &gt;&gt; Because worship is something that gives good smell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the nose of the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Something that smells good. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it is it is our form of worship. That's why everything that they put on top of the on top of the altar, that's their worship. They burn it. Amen. And and and and all you know the the the aroma, Amen. It goes and it it becomes so good. Amen. In the smell of the Lord. That's worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you you you may dance, you may jump, you may run, you may you you know uh but but but somehow Amen. Uh uh what gives the aroma &gt;&gt; what gives the aroma of our worship Amen is the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we put on the altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. in every age. Remember remember the uh uh those martyrs in the generation that went before us during the during the inquisition during the martyrdom. Amen. you know the the uh those uh the historian I believe that was his said you know how could God how could the god that the people worship could just you know cross his arms like that and and watch them &gt;&gt; amen they could not understand how a judge just god can can can you know take that kind of situation people are being burnt at stake amen Amen. But what makes it? It's the life that was in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. The life that was in them becomes the aroma. &gt;&gt; Amen. It smells good. Their lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You know the substance. Amen. It's the substance. And and there's nothing more Amen. than the substance of life that we live. Amen. Now, uh look at this in in in the next quote. He said, "Now remember this. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. But the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, making it lukewarm, formal, and powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing his works, attempted destruction of God's people, and the discrediting of God's word. We're in that age now. &gt;&gt; They try to discredit this word, this message that we believe. Amen. by trying to discredit the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We'll come to that later on. Amen. Remember this age, this generation is trying to discredit, disrespect the prophet of God that he has vindicated &gt;&gt; for the hour. Amen. So now he said attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. He fights that he cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is &gt;&gt; not like what who she is but what she is. &gt;&gt; Amen. and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works. She will be an invincible army. Look at this statement. She can do greater works. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the confidence of God to the bride of Christ in this generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. That she can do greater works. Why? Because there are greater challenges in this day and age that we are living in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The enemy is coming like a flood. &gt;&gt; But thank God, God has lifted up a standard. He has lifted us a word. Hallelujah. The message where we when when when the when we meet, Amen. the standard of this generation, we don't care what's going on outside. We don't care what's going in this age. Hallelujah. We have we are already settled in this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. But everything Amen that Satan will always try to discredit. Amen. Now another thing he said now the bride knows where she stands. She's very few. You know you combine all the message believers uh in Ohio. Amen. One one mega church in the denomination. We're just like this. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just like this. Hallelujah. She's just very very few. There won't be many say just a very very few. You say, "Well, there's a thousand." Yeah, but they've come up through the 2,000 years. Amen. So, now let's move on. Now, let's see after defining all these uh uh uh terms of the daughters of Zilopiad. Now, let's see what they did. He said in numbers 27, he said in verse 5, "And they stood before Moses." They stood, meaning they stand. &gt;&gt; They know where they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They know what they are. They know who they are. &gt;&gt; And they know where to go to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have a claim. They stood before Moses and before Elizar the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the Torah of the tabernacle of the congregation. Amen. And of course they have presented their claim. Amen. So what I would like to say is that Amen. these daughters of Zilopiad they were taught right. &gt;&gt; Amen. by their father. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Their father was no longer around. Amen. But they were there and they had nothing &gt;&gt; except the revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of what they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Except the revelation of who their father was. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were daughters of Zilopead. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now the main thing is that this they have their claim. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't I don't uh define that as complain. They have their claim. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's their claim? Their inheritance &gt;&gt; that belong to their father &gt;&gt; who was a firstborn. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But number one, because they know who they are, what they are, what they are supposed to claim. Now, on top of that, they know where to go to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They approached Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you put that in in in a micro presentation. Moses was their pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So they did not go to other church. &gt;&gt; They did not approach other ministers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; About their claim. &gt;&gt; They did not go from one house to another &gt;&gt; to present their issue. &gt;&gt; They go to their pastor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They go to the prophet. And they stood before Moses and before Elizar the priest. and before the princes and all the congregation of the door of tabernacle of the congregation. Amen. Saying we'll come to that later on. So now because they did the right thing, they approached the right person. Amen. If we go on if we jump in in verse 5, it says, "And Moses brought their cause before the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to see, Amen. in this in this presentation that there was no record in the Old Testament prior to this case that women received inheritance. &gt;&gt; No, no record. &gt;&gt; They had no proof. &gt;&gt; There was no reference &gt;&gt; to their case. &gt;&gt; Y But these women knew where to go. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know Moses the prophet, Moses the pastor probably. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First time. &gt;&gt; And because of the way they presented their case, Moses did not jump immediately saying, "You women, you be silent. You're not supposed to speak. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is already we have we have records before that only the firstborn and the firstborn after amen onwards. &gt;&gt; Amen. Received the inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and Moses could have read you could have stated don't you see &gt;&gt; all records that we have no women &gt;&gt; receive inheritance. Amen. So why come here and present their case? You just be silent. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Moses, because he was vindicated by the Lord, he was not quick &gt;&gt; to give conclusion. &gt;&gt; Amen. To cut them short. &gt;&gt; But Moses brought their cause before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Moses spent time. Amen. He approached God. Hallelujah. And this is what I want to say. When we do the right thing, Amen. And we approach the right person, we go to the right place. Amen. That's why, you know, in the voice of the sign, you know, brother said, we believe that every Christian ought to have a home church that they go to. That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is your home church. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every Christian ought to meet somewhere with believers. And wherever you meet, that's the church. &gt;&gt; So God has pre-planned. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he has predestinated you from eternity to eternity, he also has predestinated us. Who is supposed to be our pastor? &gt;&gt; Amen. I was called to be a pastor. that that's why God has predestinated me a people to pastor to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Elijah. Amen. Elijah. When God sent Elijah to uh to Sarah, there is already a widow waiting for him there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's this? God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Elijah didn't have to to make a a a a a great revival or somewhere. Amen. Hallelujah. But he just got there. But but God said, "I have prepared a widow there." Amen. So that's the main thing. If God I believe God has called me in the ministry, God has prepared a people for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When we go to missions, Hallelujah. And we believe that God sent us there, God prepared people there. God has prepared souls there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I remember once again, let me testify on this. So along with with with my uh murma, I want to drop some uh uh pew uh mission works. Amen. And and you see now in in in Indonesia, remember I always remember this because uh in 2003, Amen. This is the first independent uh outreach that I had outside of the Philippines. And so we went I went to Indonesia 2003. And in 2003, there were we were only working with uh uh three churches at that time. Amen. And uh by God's grace we were able to introduce what you know as I mentioned to you what they have been doing in the Philippines you know about the mystery exposition and and shared them about you know not to uh uh because this is another way of sharing the message. &gt;&gt; Uh we don't mention brother Brandham's name immediately. &gt;&gt; We don't ask the denominational leaders do you believe that that God sent forth a prophet in this generation? Amen. No, we don't believe. Oh, you're a serpent seat. &gt;&gt; We don't do that. Amen. But what we do, we share them the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We share them the word. Amen. And and as we present them uh uh the word. Amen. Uh uh we present the book of Revelation. And most of the time they have similar they have similar responses. They say, "Oh, we have not heard the book of Revelation presented that way." &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, they have the pictures. They know the seven golden candlesticks but they don't realize amen that it's not just a picture it's not just an illustration. Amen. But these are message of God. &gt;&gt; There are instruction behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And unless you understand the symbol you will not be able to benefit from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so because of that they get you know when you connect the first four seals to the church ages. Amen. They get excited and they see that in the scripture they see the church in history. &gt;&gt; They see what are they are fulfilling. Amen. And suddenly we move on on and on. Amen. And so the the the Lord blessed those uh expo early exposition and immediately 2003 2004 I came back. Amen. And you know fast forward because 2004 is too far. It's 20 years already. Amen. So after 20 years, Amen. So this coming October, Lord willing, uh uh uh brother Mahanim told me that they have arranged a a a a camp meeting and they will be gathering. And now we have dozens of churches in Indonesia over 250 million population 90% of them Muslim. But we have Amen. tens of message churches. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now believing this message of the hour and they're doing their own mission works. Why? Amen. There is no big organization. There is no denomination behind it. But God is behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is inspiring his people because this message is is is inspired. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said the word is already inspired. What only needs is somebody who is inspired. And a person that is inspired, who meets the inspired word, the inspired word plus the inspired person, it will produce the right kind of result. Hallelujah. Amen. So that's why now we're so blessed. Amen. And of course recently we have the work now. Amen. You you're you're you're very much involved with that from the very uh first trip that I had. Amen. BCF was uh uh uh behind me. Amen. And now we have established chairs. Little by little is growing. They're doing doing some works on their own also. Amen. So it's it's God behind it. We're just privileged to do our share. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why uh so now so that's why uh he said now uh when when in the message humble thyself uh he said now is this is an illustration of brother Benham. He said there someone was telling me I believe it was my brother back telling a little story today about a man a minister some one of his congregation he said he could walk a log he said pastor sure the Lord is with you there's a river and he said that's a log I can use that lag and cross the river amen congregation said sure pastor you're a man of God you can do that amen he believed his pastor very much amen he said I can pack a lag across my back when I go across. Sure, the Lord is with you. And he went and done it. He said, I can pack a lag and will a wheelbarrow across at the same time. Sure, pastor, the Lord is with you. Your faith can do anything. He said, I can put you in the wheelbarrow. And pack the lag. He say, now wait a minute. He said it's different when you are included in it yourself. Now that it's mighty good for us to say it here. Amen. It's mighty good for us to say I believe that's true. But then put it in action. You got to put it in action. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that means we go with our pastor all the way because we believe God has ordained him to lead us all the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just don't say we believe you, brother. We believe what you're doing. We believe that what you say. Amen. But you see, you go all the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if the pastor can take the risk, you go all the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So not like So it's different when we're included, we must be included. &gt;&gt; If the Lord gives a vision to the pastor, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. It goes down. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even to the lowest part of his body. That's the same thing. God being the head and we are part of the body. Amen. Uh uh the messenger. Amen. Down to the church age. Amen. Uh uh it's like it's like the the precious ointment that run down from the head of Aaron going down to his beard down to his garment. Everybody &gt;&gt; every member. Amen. We are part of it of the great move. &gt;&gt; Amen. in that way. Amen. It's not whatever whatever uh uh uh the pastor accomplished, it's not only attributed to the pastor, but it's the body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now let's go back to the uh uh to the children in verse 8. Now look at the basis of their claim. Now they had nothing. He said, "According to his daughters, Cilopead did not rebel against Moses." Let's look in verse three. No reference, no record on file. It never happened before. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But what was their basis? Amen. said, "Our Father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora." &gt;&gt; Amen. I like this portion. Yeah, we have no basis. We have nothing to offer. But there's one thing we know. Moses, &gt;&gt; there were many men who stood against you &gt;&gt; during the time of challenges, during those years in the wilderness. But we have seen, we have witnessed our father. We have witnessed some uh uh some men visiting our home, convincing our father to go against you. But this one thing we know &gt;&gt; our father, Amen, he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he died in his own sin. But there's one thing we remember and we will never forget that. Amen. Our father respect you so much, Pastor Moses. &gt;&gt; He loved you so much. Hallelujah. Even in front of you, behind you. Amen. Even if those people we have witnessed them. Amen. We they were good men a as we witnessed but when when they visited our home you you may not find it. I'm just giving an illustration. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they said he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look how our children can take a hold. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; On how we respect the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see how it will affect how will they benefit along the road because of their respect. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we put a quote on that? He said, "No." He said, "If you can't respect the man, respect the office he holds in God." That's exactly right. Respect him. If a minister comes up, your pastor always respect him. I've heard congregations talk about their pastor, how just talk about him, run him down, ridicule him. How is that pastor ever going to do anything to you? He can do it. I don't say I don't say this church. I know you love and respect, Brother Chad. Amen. I don't say this church, but I mean churches I have sin. And then you've got to love your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to know that he is a human being. &gt;&gt; And now let us linger in this next line. He said, "But yet God has made him what? &gt;&gt; His &gt;&gt; pastor, &gt;&gt; not our pastor." &gt;&gt; Yeah. God made him &gt;&gt; his pastor. &gt;&gt; That means he is God's choice. &gt;&gt; It's not he's not even our own choice. &gt;&gt; God made him his pastor. &gt;&gt; He placed you his pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like those seven stars. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the right hand of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham said why they are in the right hand? Because that means they were personally picked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were they were personally chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because they were they were in in in the right hand of him who chose them. Amen. He is able to protect them. He takes good care of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God made him his pastor. The Holy Ghost has made him overseer. Then you've got to respect him in that manner. And no matter what the pastor's done, if you respect him in your heart as God's servant, God will respect you for doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I believe. Uh, brother Chad will love me more [Laughter] because I'm saying this in his absence. Amen. The Lord God has made him overseer, then you've got to respect him in that manner. And no matter what the pastor done, if you respect him in your heart as God's servant, God will respect you for doing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So let's move forward now. So you see now we remember in in we remember in the Bible right where Elisha you know Elisha uh he was he was a man of God after Elijah but there were kids. They were ignorant. They were innocent. They knew they knew nothing. &gt;&gt; All right. But suddenly here comes Elisha. He he passed through and uh uh these playful children followed through and they lined up and they were mocking. They were teasing. They were just teasing. Amen. They said, "Oh, look at Elijah. He was baldheaded. He was coming down the road." And some little children began to say, "Old baldhead. Old baldhead. Why don't you go up like Elijah did?" Making fun of him. Now, what was all right? Now, that was all right. them little kids. Maybe it was their parents that taught them to do that. They were little fellows. They were making fun of this prophet, but they got him angry. And he turned around and put a curse on those children in the name of the Lord. And two shears come out of the woods and killed 42 little innocent children. Now that sound that don't sound the nature of the Holy Spirit. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. But he got so emotional. But because the word of God was in him, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Though he used it out of his emotion, it affected the lives of those innocent children. Killed them. Little children. An angered prophet. He cursed them. Children had to be recognized because he was a prophet. Hallelujah. Amen. So that means and and and and and you know brother Bham said you know why these little children they lose their respect to the office. Amen. In the middle he said maybe it was their parents &gt;&gt; maybe on the breakfast table lunch dinner they making fun you know and suddenly you know sometimes Amen. People don't realize &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; that children are just watching and they don't take it seriously. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know they there might be no literal wolves that will be coming out to devour the children but this represents the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you know sometimes something uh come out you know in in the home and the father and the mother and sometimes you don't just agree uh on on a little something and suddenly the father or the mother said we we're not going to church today. Amen. And children are watching. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they think that every time there is a problem let's not go to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes they talk some sometimes issues, you know, there's no church that has no problem. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's no pastor that has no problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why there is a common term, if you have a big church, you have big problems. If you have 100 congregation that means amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't realize that your problem is your pastor's problem. &gt;&gt; But do you realize that the problem of your pastor is yours as well? &gt;&gt; Big churches big problem. Small church small problem. No church. You are the problem. Amen. Because we are called to have a home church. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that means if you cannot find a church to suit you, that means you are the problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you have to thank God because you have a home church this morning to go to. You are part of it. You belong. You have a pastor. Amen. That you have to support. Amen. Hallelujah. So we we we were so blessed. Amen. So all these things. So you come to think of that respect. Amen. Respect. Amen. Is something that our children experience. Amen. They we we influence. Amen. The kind of the kind of influence and this is the claim right. This is the claim of the five daughters. We have not seen our father spoke against the prophet. Amen. And so when the time came, they used that basis, Amen. to uh uh to claim their inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's move forward now. Let's see. In Matthew chapter 27 to 29, 27 to 29. Then hallelujah. Look at this. The soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. And they stripped him and put him in a scarlet robe. And when they had platted the crown of thorns, they put it upon his head and read in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying, "Hail, King of the Jews." Look at the approach. So the approach is very important. Amen. &gt;&gt; They have the right approach to the prophet. Now here comes the people during the time of Jesus. They also called him king. They bowed their knee before him &gt;&gt; and say hail king of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Right? They have they have an outward expression. They bow their knees. Amen. They called him hail king of the Jews. Hallelujah. But they didn't have the right heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. They had the wrong approach. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "And they stripped him and put him in a scarlet robe and when they had plotted the crown of thorns and they put upon he said and read in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews. Amen. And he was not only king of the Jews, he's king of kings &gt;&gt; and lord of lords. &gt;&gt; And he deserved respect. &gt;&gt; But they so disrespected him. And so they did not get the right result. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wrong approach. Kane, of course, we know how kayen am I? My brother's keeper. Amen. Psal Psalm 64 in verse four. Blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. Hallelujah. So that's why even when we come in the tabernacle, the the moment you enter there, there must be a right approach. Amen. Nobody can enter. Amen. A gate cross or somewhere. You have to pass through the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as you pass through the door, you have there the sacrifice, the altar before you you enter into the most holy place. Hallelujah. There is the right approach. Amen. Remember that man in the parable, you know, uh hh uh the uh uh uh the one who who had the the feast, the wedding feast, and one was able to enter there. Amen. One was able to enter there and he didn't have the wedding garment. Where did he come from? Where did he pass through? &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why in this day and age where we have all the information available. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see you have these AIs you know you just you just search and you know you can learn about the message. &gt;&gt; You will get you will accumulate a lot of information about this message of the hour. Anybody can you know search about a certain topic. Amen. And find out and using AI you know what does the message tell about this subject something like that. Amen. You you can get an information but unless you're being led by the Holy Ghost. Amen. Hallelujah. There is there is a vast different difference between information and revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may gather all the information. Amen. You can compile all these books and you can me memorize probably pages and and and and paragraph and and and particular message and quote it one after the other. Amen. So but if there is no Amen there is no transformation there is no life manifestation it remains an information and that will not bring you to the rapture. Hallelujah. Amen. And so now he said that there must be the right approach. Amen. And so that's the same thing with this message of the hour. Amen. And so now let's go back uh uh let's go back to the book of numbers now. And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, "Now Moses presented their case." Now, this is the sequence of the uh of the the the scene. Amen. They presented their cause to Moses. And Moses hh uh presented their case to the Lord. Amen. And the Lord spake unto Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we believe that if we present our case to the Lord, &gt;&gt; he answers. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Moses and the Lord spake unto Moses saying, "The daughters of Zilopiad, speak right." &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Amen. The daughters of Celopi had speak right. Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance, I'm sorry, among their father's brethren. And thou shalt cause the inheritance of their past father to pass unto them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now is the cast here. It never happened before. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But because they presented their case to the right person, they went to the right place and they approached they had the right approach. Now God instructed Moses. Amen. To give them their the inheritance that belong to their father which did not happen before. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt surely. What's the reason? The daughters of Cilopiad speak right. Because of that, thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. Amen. So if we can quote, Amen. We remember because of this right approach, we remember Rahab, Amen. Uh uh he he uh accepted uh uh the the the spies that Joshua sent. Amen. And now moving forward here. Amen. And and and and and in paragraph 199, you know, prior to that, brother Banner was testifying that they they were having just a normal fellowship, having coffee together with Tetas testifying, and there were other brethren. Amen. When he was telling about the squirrel, telling about, you know, the miracles that the Lord had done. Amen. Now, we might not know it. We were not there but probably some were there present and maybe uh for them the prophet was you know it it must be too good to be true for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Luke in paragraph 199 after uh referring to those squirrels. Amen. God being the Jehovah Gyra. He said, "And little old quiet sister Haiti sitting back there a little dust bonnet on like the country women were there. And she put on a little clean dress to come over to help her mother cook me a dinner." And she was sitting with her hand like this. And she said, "That's nothing but the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's nothing but the truth. She said the right thing. &gt;&gt; Here's my Bible. And as a servant of God, I say this, I could hardly hear the last. She said her mother was trying to say something, but I didn't get it. Just as she said, she said that she said the right thing. The spirit of the Lord said to me, tell her to ask what she will and you &gt;&gt; give it to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, sons and daughters of God. Amen. We were declared that we can speak a word and that word will come into existence and we can live into that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe in a simple illustration, you know, our words can create an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It creates an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you look to each other, Amen. You know, sometimes uh uh uh remember one time, brother Brennan, you know, he just arrived home and and here comes the wife. you know, she was kind of uh frustrated, irritated, you know, the these these girls playing and doing all the house chores and everything and you know, some sort of expression. Amen. Of a tired mother in the home, tired wife in the home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when she when when he heard when brother Brandham heard that Hallelujah, he didn't say, "Don't you realize I come from the mission work?" &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he spoke the thing. &gt;&gt; Just a little embrace and said, "Just take a rest. Let me do the rest." &gt;&gt; Amen. It changed the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It changed the atmosphere. And I believe it's the same thing. Hallelujah. Because there is power in the word that when we speak the right thing, it creates the right atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of that very simple statement, I believe that, brother Brennan. &gt;&gt; I believe what you said. Hallelujah. And we know the rest of the story. And he said, "I couldn't speak that room. Everybody felt strange." I said, "Sister Hetti," she said, "Yes, brother Brennan." I said, "Thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; Speak anything that you desire. I don't care what it is. If you want to know what God has given this ministry, speak anything that you desire. Thus sayaeth the Lord, if you'll speak it, I'll speak it behind you and you'll have it right there. Eight people standing there looking. Amen. Thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just a simple statement, &gt;&gt; brother Brennan, that's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; That creates an atmosphere. Hallelujah. Because something good was spoken to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No, no hesitance, no refusal, no resistance. Just believe. &gt;&gt; Because she believed. She respected the prophet that God vindicated. Amen. Brother Brenham. That's nothing but the truth. Amen. With just little excitement in her heart. Brother Brandham, that's nothing but the truth. Amen. He changed the atmosphere. Hallelujah. The earthly simple home atmosphere changed and that presence went Hallelujah. Amen. That presence went reach up to the uh uh to the service. Amen. And and and and God was so true in his word. Amen. And so she said, "Brother Brennham, what shall I say?" I said, "It's up to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. So I mentioned this before and you know that brother Brandham you know he he made he he he he gave a a a choice an option. Amen. But you know God trust that woman so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knew what was in the mind and heart of that woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was in such a place in such a real in such a condition of her faith that when she speaks she speaks the right thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was nothing wrong if she has healing. There was nothing wrong if she asked for some wealth. There's nothing wrong with that because it was supported by a thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But even then she did not only say the right thing to brother Brham. Brother Brham that's nothing but the truth. That's right. But even under the atmosphere of thus sayaeth the Lord. Hallelujah. Hey the right spoke the right thing. &gt;&gt; He she spoke the right choice. I want the salvation of my two sons. &gt;&gt; She asked for salvation. Hallelujah. Amen. I believe. Hallelujah. That same thus sayaeth the Lord is in the bride right now. Hallelujah. We can claim our children. We can claim our parents. We can speak the right thing. Hallelujah. And have passion for their souls. &gt;&gt; While we are still here, hallelujah. The the bride is being placed in such a position. The voice of God is where? In the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God is God is expecting. God is has an assurance to to entrust his voice to us to the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why that is our focus in this generation. We don't want you know it's not our desire to get rich. Why we are we're having business. We're we're working. Amen. Our young people are going to school studying. Amen. Our main focus is not just to get rich, get some higher grades and finish our course and so on. Hallelujah. a a person that is converted. Hallelujah. That's why brother Bham said uh preach about convinced and concerned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are fully convinced by this message of the hour. Hallelujah. And that conviction does not stop to us alone. &gt;&gt; We are concerned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are concerned for souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh uh I was testifying to uh to the brothers to brother Jeriah and of course to the brother Steven and brother Franco while we we were having dinner. Amen. You know while while I'm still here. Amen. While while I'm still here uh uh uh I received three weeks ago I received a uh a message from a person I don't remember and said uh Pastor Danny can you can you visit us? Amen. in this in in in the island and I could not recognize and said, "Excuse me, I'm sorry, but uh who are you? When was the last time we met?" Amen. And and and he said, "You visited us, you know, you you you know, in in sometime in 2018, you've been you've been in this, you know, I've been in that island. It's called RMLON conducted 2018 and at that time uh I had the strong feeling that there were ministers that are very interested but they belong to a very uh uh uh prominent denomination and uh under a certain influential uh uh bishop of some sort. Amen. And so I was prevented from coming back. But here comes a message uh that they said during the pandemic. That was 2018 &gt;&gt; and 2025 already. That's why I forgot. Amen. &gt;&gt; I may be getting old. I remember you know it's good to remember 2003 I came first to Indonesia and it's been 22 years. It's good to hear but on the other side you realize I am 22 years older. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But you see now here comes a call once again. Can you visit us? And they said they're already willing because uh they stream some of our services and now they're willing to go out of the denomination. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I go home, Amen. We have a church affair in October. And then last part of October, I'm scheduled to go to Indonesia. And then uh uh uh uh uh November go back to South Korea because I have constant communication with the pastor over there uh uh from the denomination also. And so I have lineup. I'm still here. &gt;&gt; But you know, these are souls. Yes. &gt;&gt; And so without even thinking because we're after these souls, &gt;&gt; we are ready, you know, to come out of the denomination. And I committed already, okay, let's do it before the end of the year. I will be there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Concerned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We enjoy the message. We enjoy the deep revelation of the word. Our faith is being steered. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we must be overflowing with joy &gt;&gt; so that others will benefit from it. &gt;&gt; We drink. Amen. Come that who that is thirsty come. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you drink then you are able to provide drink as well. &gt;&gt; That's the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. It doesn't stop &gt;&gt; in us. We need to take it to somebody else. Brother said that is being convinced and concerned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So while we are studying students, young people, Amen. we're working, Amen. we're doing some kind of business. Amen. Our main focus still, Amen. If our focus is just to get rich here on earth, we're missing the point. Yes, &gt;&gt; there are still, it's Banham said, and I'm not tired of saying this over and over again. It's not fair that we're enjoying this message so much or hearing this message quite a number of times. But there are people out there that have not heard this message, not a single time. &gt;&gt; We have to do something. Thank God you're doing something. And I thank God. I thank God you're doing your portion. Amen. So he come. Now what happened because of that simple statement? Oh, brother Brennham, that's nothing but the truth. Amen. And there he said, "And those little modern teenage nickel preach boys that had hated the very cause of Christ grab one another and begin to scream the blessings of God. The power of God struck that place. Banks fell into his plate. I don't know what happened for about 10 minutes. The presence of God was so abundant." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. two young souls at that time never knew nothing about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were just playing right there in the back in in in the in in the parking lot. They were not actually in the meeting. But the presence of God, Amen. Hallelujah. Strapped them and the voice of that mother was heard. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Starting from saying the right thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And spoke the right thing. He had the right choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want the salvation of my two sons. Amen. The presence of God moved and there was so much presence. Amen. In that congregation and then the presence of God. Amen. The presence of God. Amen. And then it went to the parking lot. Amen. And reach out for those two boys who knew nothing about it. He knew nothing what their mother spoke. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the presence of God pulled them. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And said they walk, Amen. in the middle and they were raising their hand. And those two little modern teenage sneak preach boys that had hated the very cause of Christ grabbed one another and begin to scream the blessings of God. The power of God struck that place. Banks fell into his plate. Amen. I don't know what happened for about 10 minutes. Glory to God. Amen. Friends, do you realize what that was? I have never in all my life had felt such anointing. Never before. Amen. Brother said, I have never felt such an anointing. The first time, &gt;&gt; my the first time it was ever performed on a human being, it bypass aristocrats. bypassed everything else and went to a poor little with the woman living up on hill there. Hallelujah. It never happened before. &gt;&gt; Even the prophet said first time it happened. First time I felt such kind of an anointing. Where did it start? From a simple mother speaking the right thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We have some some opportunities. Hallelujah. Amen. I I we just pray that when the opportunity comes. Amen. But Bible said God knew what you would ask. God knew what you would ask. &gt;&gt; And you know when God knew what you will ask and your mind goes with the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God entrusts us with thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And that's the main thing. God knew what she would ask. Her two boys were gloriously saved the very minute it was spoken. If she would have asked for a $1,000, it would have been given to her. If she would have asked for her sister's healing, it would have been given to her. Anything that she would ask. Amen. It would have been given to her. &gt;&gt; But thank God she asked for the right thing. &gt;&gt; May we ask the right thing this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. something that is valuable, something that is eternal. May we do something for God's glory. Amen. I I call this verse 7 to 11, the bride as a game changer. [Laughter] Amen. You know why? Because it never happened before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have come into the age of first time. &gt;&gt; Praise God. things that have not never happened before. Things that have never been witnessed before &gt;&gt; but because of the presence of the bride. Hallelujah. Who has thus said the Lord because of the presence of the bride who knows her position what she is standing for. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are many things that have that are happening right now that are happening in this generation for the very first time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Look in verse 11 is verse seven. The daughters of Cilopia speak right. Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren. And thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father. Amen. To pass unto them. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is the first time that women receive direct inheritance. &gt;&gt; First time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Because they stood their ground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes, you know, we think, you know, uh uh uh uh we're in the market, we're in the public place. Amen. Sometimes we're being trapped of something. Amen. And and then and and uh uh but because we know where we are standing, we know how to speak. We know how how we stand. Amen. Things happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember uh uh uh one sister in the church. It's it it happened long time uh ago and I I was doing uh uh a Bible study in an office. Amen. And and and uh there's there's a brother in our congregation uh that witness in the office and maybe those uh uh uh uh employees that he was sharing the the message with, you know, have have some backgrounds and he come up with say let me call my pastor. And so they arranged a Bible study. Now the the the the place was 15 minutes from their office. Amen. It's in a Jollibee. Yeah, brother John know what Jollibee is. Amen. So it's it's it's a one of the food chains in the Philippines. So it's just 15 minutes walk from their office, but it is 1 hour and a half from our home. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I have to drive to hit that break time between 12 and 1. Amen. And uh 12:15 they will be there. We will have some burger. Amen. Of course, our burger is not as good as your burgers here. Amen. Our burgers are big in the picture, photogenic, but they're small in reality. Amen. But here every time if my wife is with me, we just order one and we share it. Otherwise, when I order one, it box follows it immediately. Amen. So that's the way. So I travel hour and a half, but they travel 15 minutes and they get there and then we do Bible study 30 minutes. Amen. And so then we do study, Bible study and it happened you know probably about two months and then we come up to a certain and and one of the sisters she always wear pants. Amen. She always wear wear pants and she he she has this bandana and it look like uh a male you know the first time but but then and she is very you know she's asking questions and then we come up with the point and and she said last time that she said pastor Danny uh the the the the the baptism is periscriptural But you see, I see the believers, they wear skirts, but I cannot. It's been me all along. But but I said, you just believe. &gt;&gt; It's not your problem. It's not even my problem. &gt;&gt; You just believe. If you believe this word, this portion of the word that you believe, Amen. Believe and do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she did. So he said, "Okay, it's okay. So next Sunday I will attend your church. His name her name is Ruby. Amen. But you see and then uh uh she attended and I was surprised she was wearing skirt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he got baptized and uh she said and so since then she never wore pants again. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know because she was close to the manager to the owner actually of the of the of the business she was working with and then the blessing did not stop to her. &gt;&gt; She proposed to the to the employer why don't we why don't we uh make this a uh a proposal that women in our office wear skirts. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there's another employee. Amen. And they say, you know, you know, we are friends. You know, we're friends. But how come, you know, because uh she she had kind of an eczema or something. And then they they kept on. And so they prayed. And so that friend attended the attended the Bible study also &gt;&gt; and she also baptized. She got also baptized. And then this sister, her name is Sister Jane. She testified to her family. &gt;&gt; Amen. And her family, they hosted a Bible study. We got there, the father got baptized, the mother got baptized, and all the siblings got baptized. &gt;&gt; So the blessing was being passed on &gt;&gt; from one soul to another to the family, so forth and so on. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know the good news, none none of them attend my church. Because sister Ruby and his family is close to brother Netor, they go there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the other families, Amen. They are closer to uh uh brother Dennis Credto who is also a product of Mystery Expo. They go there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing remained. I just labored. &gt;&gt; They they benefit. &gt;&gt; But we're all working &gt;&gt; for the glory of the Lord &gt;&gt; because this is not our people. This is God's people. &gt;&gt; Amen. The most important thing is for them to receive the word, to receive the message of the hour and let the word do something for them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But my point is, Hallelujah. The blessing does not stop to us. I was the first one who received this message in my family. Amen. And and and and my my my mother and my two uncles and then my my two aunties. Amen. Now my my my my my cousins and then my n my nieces and nephews, they're coming to the church. I was the first one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So remember this blessing. And this is what I'm trying to tell you. Amen. The inheritance. Amen. Were passed on to their to the to the daughters of Celopia, the firstborn. &gt;&gt; Amen. It never happened before. &gt;&gt; But now it happened. And now he said, he said, "Now, Amen. Uh uh, thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter." It became a mandate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It became a declaration. Not only to the daughters of Zilopihad, but in generations to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the same situation happens, you don't have to ask me, Moses. Hallelujah. The generations after you don't have to ask. Amen. It's already a mandate. It must be a law. It must be something that must be implemented all throughout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just because of these five daughters of Cilopia who stood their ground. &gt;&gt; Just because there is one mother who spoke the right thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The benefit was being passed on to the generations. It became a declaration. &gt;&gt; It is something that you have to recon with. It is something that you can refer to. One time it happened, it will happen again. Hallelujah. Brother Brenham said if God bless the person. Amen. Because he meets some kind of a standard. If God respond to that person and somebody Amen. meets the same standard, God is obligated &gt;&gt; to respond to that call. &gt;&gt; The same thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now in verse 9, and if he have no daughter, then shall you give his inheritance unto his brethren. And 10, and if he has no brethren, then you shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. And if his father have no brethren, then he shall give his inheritance unto his kinsmen that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it, and he shall be unto the children of Israel, statute of judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses. Glory to God. Amen. So it became a decree. Amen. Again, it never happened before. And then in the continuation in chapter 36, it was quoted and they said, "The Lord commanded my Lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel. And my Lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Cilopia, our brother, unto his daughters." Now it is being quoted. &gt;&gt; It's being a reference already. &gt;&gt; Amen. in numbers. And not only that, even Joshua, they were already in the promised land. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were already in the promised land. And Joshua referred to the same thing. But Celopia had the son of Epher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, and no sons, but daughters. And these are the names of his daughters. Malan, Noah, Glamila, and Ta. Amen. So it happened. It continue on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the bride is a game changer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you know who we are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What we are standing for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 205. I believe speaking the church of the living God is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the first time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; It's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being. Ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire. Don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Where is the voice of God? It's in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're living in that age. before it says we are moving into that spear. And let me declare this morning, we are already there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're no longer waiting for anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of course, uh uh uh the the the seven visions, Amen. were uh the destruction of America. But why should we wait? &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. all these things. Brother Venom said there's only one thing that we're waiting that's the body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm looking forward to that. Amen. We have ended. So now he said we're leaving. God is moving into a sphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They say, you know, when we when when when the when the squeeze comes, watch the third pull. Then let me ask you, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't we experience squeeze now? Yes, &gt;&gt; we do. &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery exposition that we were doing before, before it's easy to coordinate, it's easy to arrange. But now because of the social media, they have learned so much about the end time message, about the name uh uh brother William Marian Brham. Amen. It's not that easy. &gt;&gt; Amen. The denominations are also closing their doors now. We're already in the gleaning time. &gt;&gt; We're being squeezed. were being pushed into one corner. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where's the third pull now? It's in the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or maybe Oh, why brother? Why why brother Danny? You know the word said uh you speak to that mountain and that mountain be moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Maybe you speak that mountain to be moved and maybe the the big mountain is still there, but because you speak, &gt;&gt; you don't realize it. You don't see it in your naked eye, but there is already a small stone that rule already &gt;&gt; when you spoke." &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes there are things that we want to happen in our families, &gt;&gt; in our children. &gt;&gt; Amen. We claim our children said you applied the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's our the place of safety. &gt;&gt; Amen. In your naked eye some it might be nothing is happening but because you believe God &gt;&gt; you claim what you have spoken of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't see it but something is already moving in their hearts. &gt;&gt; Maybe your family, maybe your neighbors. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Just believe. &gt;&gt; We're in that realm already. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're there. Amen. So that's why he said when the Methodist failed, God raised up others. And so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to this final age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; I love him. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because he first loved us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Few more slides here. Now see here. &gt;&gt; Uh I say this, we go back to verse one. I say this bonus. I'm done with my main menu. Amen. So this is now the what you call that &gt;&gt; dessert. The dessert. Amen. Numbers 27:E1. Then came the daughters of Zilopiad. Amen. Zilopihad the son of Heer means well the youngest son of Gilead and then Father the son of Makir elder son of Manasse and Manasse eldest son of Joseph and then Joseph. &gt;&gt; Okay. So see the lineage the lineage of zilopiad is zilopiader gilead makir manasse Joseph that's the lineage right &gt;&gt; now we know that Joseph had two sons the other one was Ephraim &gt;&gt; Amen by birth is the elder &gt;&gt; he had the birthright supposedly &gt;&gt; in the eyes of Joseph Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that was in the eyes of Joseph. Now it never happened before. &gt;&gt; It never happened before because all the while Amen. Uh all the benefits go to the &gt;&gt; elder to the eldest the birthright. Amen. But this time listen so in the mind of Joseph Ephraim was the first Manasseh was the second. So when when when he requested blessing from his father who was old and his eyes were dimmed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he placed Ephraim on the right side of uh of Jacob of Israel and Manasseh on the left. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now when when when when Israel was about to give the blessing, &gt;&gt; Amen. he crossed &gt;&gt; his arm. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Joseph jumped and said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute, father. That's not the way it should be." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he tried to correct the prophet. That's not the way it should be. Amen. This is This should be Your right hand should be on A-frame. Amen. I know that's Abraham. Amen. But it's not me. But God crossed my hand. &gt;&gt; And the blessing went to Manasse. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so where is the lineage of Zilopiad? Manasse to the younger. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had greater blessings. So that's the same thing with Israel and the bride. Amen. Because of the cross, &gt;&gt; the blessing went to the bride and we are enjoying that. We belong to that lineage. Hallelujah. Amen. We became the daughters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of the firstborn. Glory to God. Amen. You love him this morning. Amen. So that's your bonus. That's your dessert. Amen. But let me tell you something this morning as I call on our precious brother. Amen. And the musicians, please. Amen. So listen there's one thing that I want to leave on you. Amen. You know the basis of the daughters of Zilopead was our father did not rebel against the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many things going on. Hallelujah. But there's one thing the bride hallelujah claims today. There's one thing that is the basis of our claim of our inheritance because we have a father because we have a prophet in this generation that have begotten us. &gt;&gt; Like Paul through this gospel and and he said I have never been amened to the heavenly vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He said, "Will Paul be presenting his people also?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Will will Paul present Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And he had that confidence. Well, I preached what Paul preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters, we have that kind of confidence. &gt;&gt; Because our prophet did not revel against the word of God. He became obedient to the word until his final life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Final stage of this life. &gt;&gt; Literally, fathers and mothers, this is something we can leave to our children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For them to witness that we have never been a rebel &gt;&gt; to this message to our pastor, to our church. Young people, you may say, "I'm blessed. I finished my studies. I'm blessed with good job." Remember, it's because you have parents who stood their ground &gt;&gt; to this message. They have never been a rebel. &gt;&gt; They stood with the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's why you're enjoying all these blessings. Glory to God. Let's all stand up and praise him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You daughters of the firstborn. Amen. It's time to claim our inheritance. It's here. Thank you, Lord. Let me leave you with some kind of prayer this morning. Dear heavenly father, we are completely committed, Lord. &gt;&gt; We will remain faithful. But at the end of the road, we shall say, "We have run the race. We have finished the course. Oh Lord, thank you for your goodness. Thank you for your mercy. We appreciate this congregation Lord. Hallelujah. For their passion, for their burden to be part of every mission, Lord, that they're being part of. Bless them abundantly. Take good care of our precious brother Chad, his family, and his faithful congregation. Lord. Hallelujah. We thank you and we give you Lord all the glory and the honor in Jesus Christ's name. Everybody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We love you. Just keep on praying for brother Danny, my wife Isabella. Send greetings to you. Amen. And our little congregation back there in the Philippines. So, thank you and God bless you. [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're always thankful when brother Danny comes and he brought us words of wisdom from someone who's been in the field for a long long time and seen many churches and many situations. Um let's actually go to the key of D and sing that song just to be a blessing. Uh this is a song I I hear that uh the brothers sing a lot of times and now we're going to get an opportunity to sing it back to brother Danny as he goes home to continue his missions work. just to be a blessing. I'll go on a jour and cross the deep blue sea, leave home and family. I'll go where the spirit leads me. I'm giving my life away just to be a blessing. One more time. Just to be a blessing. I'll go on a jour. Climb up the highest mountain and cross the deep blue sea. leave home and family. I'll go where the spirit leads me. I'm giving my life away just to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; And we'll just close the service in a word of prayer. Dear heavenly father, we thank you for the service that we heard this morning. Lord, I pray that you'd help each one of us to realize our our position and our potential and our responsibility, Father. Lord, I pray that you would take the word that's been swn into our hearts, Father, that we would be good prepared ground, Lord, ready to receive your word and to bring forth fruit for you. Lord, I pray you'd bless Brother Danny as he travels back home. That you would bless every aspect of his trip, Father. That you would give him renewed energy and vigor to continue the work where he's been placed. Lord, as we're part of the same team, I pray that you would help us here to do our part. Help Brother Danny to do his part, Father. Lord, that you could do something greater than we could do on our own. We commit ourselves into your hands and thank you for the word in Jesus name. Amen.
