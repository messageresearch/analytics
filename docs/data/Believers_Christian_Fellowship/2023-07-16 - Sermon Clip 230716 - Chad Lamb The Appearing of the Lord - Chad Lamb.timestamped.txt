[0:00] you know Sarah was struggling all along
[0:03] and misunderstanding
[0:06] but when God came on the plains of
[0:09] memory he began to deal with her
[0:12] he began to confirm the promise to her
[0:14] he began to show the mystery part was
[0:17] her
[0:18] that she had to Bear the son nobody else
[0:19] could do it it's got to be you
[0:21] it's not for somebody else it's not for
[0:23] another age God has come in this age and
[0:26] he's come to us individually he said
[0:27] listen he's showing the sign of the
[0:30] Messiah it's the son of man has returned
[0:32] Amen in a prophetic Ministry amen
[0:34] showing us it's not another age it's not
[0:36] for somebody else it's for you
[0:38] all these promises are for you amen the
[0:40] chains of the body is for you the
[0:42] overcoming life is for you healing's for
[0:44] you Deliverance is for you the change of
[0:46] your atoms is for you the slipping of
[0:48] Dimension it's all for you
[0:50] overcoming in Satan's eating it's for
[0:52] you amen
[0:54] it's all for you amen and he showed it
[0:57] and then now God so graciously one by
[1:00] one is individuals he'll come to you
[1:02] individually and confirm the promise and
[1:05] what did it do for Sarah what it did for
[1:07] Sarah was gave her faith amen because
[1:10] the Hebrews 11 says by faith Sarah
[1:13] receive strength herself too can save
[1:15] how did she do it by faith God needed
[1:18] Sarah to believe
[1:21] and what does God need from you and I he
[1:23] needs us to believe amen he needs us to
[1:26] believe the word for our day he needs to
[1:28] believe the promise that's for us he
[1:30] needs us not just to believe that it's
[1:31] for Abraham it's for Jesus Christ it's
[1:33] for a worldwide this no he needs that
[1:36] Faith to go down deeper and to
[1:38] understand the mystery part of the
[1:40] prophecies the mystery part of the Bible
[1:42] and the Mystery part of the Bible is
[1:44] that I'm included
[1:47] that I'm part of the word and part of
[1:49] the prophecy amen and God is coming
[1:51] today Amen to to show himself to confirm
[1:55] the promise to show that I'm part of it
[1:57] to build my faith because he needs me to
[2:00] believe
[2:03] praise God Amen so now it's not just
[2:06] saying God sent a prophet God sent a
[2:08] prophet God appeared God appeared why
[2:10] did he appear he came to deal with the
[2:12] woman amen he came to deal with the
[2:14] mystery part he came to raise our faith
[2:16] he come to meet us at an appointed time
[2:18] Amen in a private meeting so that we can
[2:20] have quickened faith to believe we're
[2:22] part of the promise
[2:25] why did that Prophet come amen why did
[2:28] he appear in the plains of memory why
[2:29] did we have a repeat of the days of
[2:31] summer why is all this happening I don't
[2:33] know for you but for me it's so that I
[2:35] could believe that I'm part of the
[2:37] promise that I could believe that I'm
[2:38] included in this Bible
[2:41] it's not just for others it's for me why
[2:44] because he turned his back to the crowd
[2:45] into certain thoughts
[2:49] and I said that's nothing but the Lord
[2:52] that's him
[2:54] he's appearing if he's appearing these
[2:57] scriptures are fulfilled if these
[2:58] scriptures are fulfilled what what's the
[3:00] reason
[3:03] because it's time for the promise
[3:05] it's time for the promise and and
[3:08] Sarah's Got to Believe
[3:10] he said God help me believe
[3:13] help me look at what you've done and
[3:15] recognize it and meet you personally and
[3:17] recognize it for me
