[13:37] Christ's name we pray amen and God bless
[13:41] you we're going to ask you to have your
[13:41] seats for just a moment thank you
[13:44] musicians I have a an announcement to
[13:47] make I like making announcements but I'd
[13:49] like to announce the engagement of
[13:51] brother Alex Bartram and Sister Amy
[13:53] Preston could you two stand for
[13:57] us am amen
[14:02] congratulations amen we're very happy
[14:05] and excited for you all it's one of my
[14:07] favorite things to make good
[14:08] announcements amen I'd love to do that
[14:10] and I I want to beat social media every
[14:12] time you know how hard that is but they
[14:14] were engaged Friday evening and so we're
[14:17] very very happy for them uh just wanted
[14:19] to remind you real quick that brother
[14:20] Gabe is in Pittsburgh this morning
[14:22] ministering for brother Jean so he
[14:24] traveled there yesterday he'll be
[14:25] traveling back this afternoon so
[14:27] remember to keep him in prayer
[14:30] also I was grateful to hear sister
[14:31] Rachel's testimony they called and I
[14:35] talked to her and brother John as well
[14:37] and it what amazed me was that she was
[14:40] having pain because of the pain she went
[14:42] in and found out she had minor there
[14:45] minor small blood clots in the lung that
[14:47] the doctors believe will take care of
[14:49] themselves that it'll it'll be resolved
[14:51] on its own but because of that she went
[14:53] in to find out that somewhere along the
[14:55] way she had a brain bleed and she never
[14:58] knew it
[14:59] and those of you who know that can be
[15:01] quite lethal it's very deadly and they
[15:04] don't know if it was at the time of the
[15:05] accident or after all they can say is
[15:07] that she had a brain bleed but on its
[15:11] own it was self-contained and stopped
[15:14] bleeding and she's not in Risk right now
[15:17] and I just thank God that God took her
[15:19] through that process to show her I've
[15:21] been taking care of you all alone God be
[15:24] praised
[15:29] like brother Blake said we don't know
[15:31] sometimes what God is doing for us and
[15:33] how much he's protecting us and watching
[15:35] over us but there's times that he gives
[15:38] us a glimpse and we realize how special
[15:40] his care is for us also yesterday I got
[15:43] a really wonderful uh testimony from
[15:46] Sister Jose paac she's in Quebec Canada
[15:49] right now visiting her mother and uh she
[15:53] told me that um I think it was yesterday
[15:55] morning she went to move her car they
[15:58] had got a foot of fresh snow I would
[16:01] love to be in Quebec I love snow a foot
[16:04] of fresh snow overnight she went to move
[16:07] her car so that this plow truck wouldn't
[16:09] block it in and when she went to move it
[16:12] she found she she didn't have her key
[16:14] she couldn't find her key she looked all
[16:16] over and she remembered the day before
[16:19] she was out cross country skiing and she
[16:22] remember she fell down at one place in
[16:23] the trail and she thought maybe her keys
[16:25] could have fallen out well she was
[16:27] CrossCountry skiing on top of two foot
[16:30] of fresh snow they had gotten before
[16:32] then the night after another foot of
[16:34] snow fell on top of it so she prayed and
[16:37] she went to the spot she fell down and
[16:39] she dug down and in a very short amount
[16:41] of time she found her key fob hallelujah
[16:44] amen praise be to
[16:48] God she needless to say she was very
[16:52] excited and she called it a miracle amen
[16:55] a miracle cuz she hadd been out on her
[16:58] mother's 29 Acres out there and who
[17:00] knows where but God knew that's more
[17:02] than a needle in a hay stack F we thank
[17:05] God for that amen if you would let's all
[17:08] stand together just want to remind you
[17:11] that today we have communion and feet
[17:12] washing uh this afternoon also want to
[17:16] uh give a greeting to brother cus cob
[17:18] God bless you brother cus he's been here
[17:19] for over a week and I forgot to greet
[17:21] him the last two Services he's actually
[17:22] fing home tomorrow so please take your
[17:24] greetings back to our greetings back to
[17:27] your family for us amen it's been good
[17:29] to have him here amen amen let's turn in
[17:33] our Bibles to the book of
[17:39] Colossians the book of Colossians
[17:41] chapter
[17:48] 1 in Colossians let's go to chapter 1
[17:52] verse
[17:57] 21 he says in you you that were
[17:59] sometimes alienated in enemies in your
[18:01] mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he
[18:04] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[18:07] through death to present you holy and
[18:10] unblamable and unreprovable in his sight
[18:14] amen thank God God bless you as you take
[18:16] your seats keep your Bibles open there
[18:18] and we'll take a look at
[18:21] this uh I'd like for a subject to take
[18:23] the subject the body of Christ and uh as
[18:27] many times we go back and we review
[18:29] something again these are things we'll
[18:30] talk about today are things that are
[18:32] quite common to us but always God has a
[18:34] way of adding some brushstrokes to the
[18:36] picture adding some color and it just
[18:38] gets more vibrant and clear and so we
[18:40] love to Circle back around and look at
[18:42] these things as God deals with them in
[18:44] this and and brother brandham made this
[18:46] statement the God of this evil age he
[18:49] said in God's Own thinking God the great
[18:52] spirit in the beginning before there was
[18:53] a beginning he was God and did you know
[18:57] you were in him then if you are a
[18:59] Christian now you was in him then and
[19:01] then if that be so the whole godhead
[19:03] bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus
[19:06] Christ and when Jesus died at the cross
[19:08] I died with him for I was in him then
[19:12] what a statement for he was the fullness
[19:14] of the word manifested knowing that we
[19:17] would be manifested later and we was at
[19:20] Calvary with him listen there's there's
[19:23] there's no time that I know of in
[19:25] history just I haven't been a huge study
[19:27] of history but read many times and uh
[19:30] biographies and some sermons of and who
[19:32] who told us these things before now who
[19:35] told us that when he was on the cross we
[19:37] were with him then that we were we were
[19:39] there and obviously we know we weren't
[19:41] there in this flesh body it was not the
[19:43] flesh element that's born of man and
[19:45] woman the the the 46 chromosomes that
[19:48] come 23 from Mom 23 that wasn't what was
[19:50] there but that Eternal piece of life
[19:53] that attribute of God that was meant to
[19:55] be us that's the true us that's the
[19:57] reality of God of God's family of God's
[19:59] children that that's in us now was in
[20:02] him then because he was the fullness of
[20:04] the word and we're a part of the word
[20:06] but all the word was gathered up into
[20:08] him and the Word was made flesh and so
[20:11] at this end time the the prophet begins
[20:13] to to the take the veil away and begin
[20:16] to open up to us the realities amen of
[20:19] the word and when we look at this in in
[20:22] uh chapter uh 1:
[20:25] 21 he says you that were alienated and
[20:27] enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet
[20:30] now hath he reconciled and if you look
[20:32] at the end of the word reconciled
[20:33] there's no punctuation there's no calmer
[20:36] there's no period there's there's
[20:37] nothing it goes right from this to the
[20:39] next verse Amen in the body of his flesh
[20:43] through death so how did he reconcile me
[20:46] in the body of his flesh because he was
[20:49] the word made flesh and so where was I I
[20:51] was there I don't I don't have any
[20:54] remembrance of it brother benam said no
[20:55] recollection it it's not like amen it's
[20:58] it's not like what what sometimes we
[21:00] think of humanly but that part that was
[21:02] to be me was there amen so we were
[21:05] reconciled in the body of his flesh and
[21:07] so so Christ the anointed word had a
[21:11] body and that body was Jesus Christ and
[21:16] and we were there amen and sometimes we
[21:19] say you know in in what way we
[21:21] understand what the prophet say we
[21:22] repeat the things that the prophet told
[21:24] us but these little Minds can't
[21:26] comprehend it like we can't I can't
[21:27] explain it but something down inside
[21:29] says amen amen amen and then can you
[21:32] explain that to me how that worked what
[21:34] part what was the chemistry what was the
[21:35] mechanics and I say brother I can't tell
[21:37] you I have no idea but how do you know
[21:39] you were there because I don't know
[21:41] whenever brother Brenham says it
[21:42] something in me starts jumping up and
[21:44] saying that's the truth amen so we were
[21:47] in that body and Christ had a body the
[21:50] body of Jesus Christ but then we know
[21:53] that after that that body was crucified
[21:56] and he became the propitiation for our
[21:58] sins
[21:59] amen that and and and brother bam tells
[22:01] us that that body amen went on to Heaven
[22:04] he still has a body on Earth and that's
[22:07] what we want to talk about let's turn to
[22:09] 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[22:14] together 1 Corinthians chapter
[22:24] 12 1 Corinthians chap 12 verse
[22:30] 12 for as the body is one and hath many
[22:33] members and all the members of that one
[22:34] body being many are one body so also is
[22:38] Christ so what do you mean so also is
[22:41] Christ it means Christ is a many
[22:42] membered body that's what the scripture
[22:44] is telling us for by one Spirit we are
[22:47] all baptized into one body whether we be
[22:49] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[22:51] free and have been all made to drink
[22:54] unto one spirit for the body is not one
[22:57] member but many now let's go down to
[23:00] verse 27 says now ye are the body of
[23:04] Christ and members in
[23:07] particular so Christ is now a many
[23:10] membered body he has a body on this
[23:12] Earth that he's working in but that body
[23:16] is not the singular form that we saw uh
[23:19] in the man who was nailed to the cross
[23:21] but now it's his church it's his
[23:23] redeemed people born again by a spirit
[23:25] they are now the many membered body of
[23:28] of Jesus Christ and ye are the body of
[23:31] Christ but members in particular so I
[23:33] may not be all of it but I'm part of it
[23:36] amen I may be a tiny listen I may be a
[23:40] tiny part of it but praise God I'm part
[23:43] of it part of the body of Christ
[23:46] amen uh brother bam said now if I told
[23:50] you the truth Jesus Christ will work in
[23:52] his church you and I just the same as he
[23:54] did when he was here on Earth in a
[23:56] physical body how many knows that his
[23:58] his physical body sits on the throne of
[24:00] God in his Spirit returned to the Earth
[24:02] to live in the church to energize it as
[24:05] a vine to the branches certainly then he
[24:07] has no hands but mine and yours he has
[24:10] no eyes but mine and yours and brother
[24:12] remember is not saying he has no that
[24:15] body went amen as a propitiation the
[24:17] high priest went into the holy of holies
[24:19] in the Heavenly places for us amen but
[24:22] but he has no eyes but mine and yours no
[24:26] uh hands but mine and yours no mouth but
[24:27] mine and yours that mean doesn't mean
[24:29] his disappeared that he's talking about
[24:31] here on Earth now in this dimension in
[24:35] this manifestation if God if Christ is
[24:38] going to work he's going to work through
[24:40] his body he needs a body to manifest
[24:42] himself and that body will manifest the
[24:45] life that's in the body which is the
[24:47] Life of
[24:48] Christ and so now we he he is the the
[24:52] the the vine we are the branches amen
[24:55] and now the life is coming out of the
[24:57] branches but the life's coming from from
[24:58] the vine it's his life in us so he is a
[25:01] many-membered uh body let's go to
[25:04] Ephesians now I'm laying these
[25:06] scriptures down just as reference to to
[25:09] lay a
[25:13] foundation Ephesians
[25:19] 5 this we're going to get to a scripture
[25:21] in this reading here that's absolutely
[25:24] it's a bit shocking to me as we as we
[25:27] take the full impact of it in let's just
[25:29] begin in chapter 5: 22 and we'll work
[25:31] our way to the scripture I'm talking
[25:33] about wives submit yourselves un your
[25:36] own husband as unto the Lord for the
[25:38] husband is the head of the wife even as
[25:41] Christ is the head of the church and he
[25:43] is the savior of the body therefore as
[25:45] the church is subject into Christ so let
[25:47] the wives be to their own husbands in
[25:49] everything husbands love your wives even
[25:52] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[25:54] himself for it that he might sanctify
[25:57] and cleanse it with the water washing of
[25:58] Water by the word that he might present
[26:01] it to himself a glorious church not
[26:04] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[26:06] but that it should be holy and without
[26:09] blemish so ought men to love their wives
[26:12] as their own bodies he that loveth his
[26:14] wife loveth himself I think this is
[26:17] interesting he's saying we should love
[26:18] our wives as our own
[26:21] bodies as the same body just the same
[26:23] equal to my body amen because that's the
[26:26] way it was in the beginning and that's
[26:27] the way it is with Christ and his bride
[26:30] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[26:32] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[26:35] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[26:37] the Lord the church for we are members
[26:40] of his body of his flesh and of his
[26:43] bones that is the scripture that I find
[26:46] shocking that is the scripture that that
[26:49] that actually takes it away from a
[26:50] metaphorical idea and brings it right
[26:53] down into this tangible presence because
[26:56] we're part of his body of his flesh and
[26:58] of his bones amen I I when when I mean
[27:03] I've read that for many years but in in
[27:05] the last few years it began to have
[27:07] impact on me that that he actually wants
[27:10] this body of Flesh to manifest himself
[27:13] through amen and so he says now we are
[27:16] members of his body of his flesh and of
[27:18] his bones for this cause shall a man
[27:20] leave his father and mother and shall be
[27:22] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[27:24] be one flesh this is a great mystery but
[27:27] I speak concerning Christ
[27:28] and the church so that means we are
[27:31] members of his body of his flesh and of
[27:35] his
[27:36] bones that to me seems pretty
[27:42] tangible
[27:43] Amen in the message Christ is the Myster
[27:46] God revealed he says he is the head of
[27:48] the church which is his body and he
[27:50] wants the preeminent is listen now
[27:52] listen close while we're going he is to
[27:55] be the head of the body his bride's body
[27:58] which is taken from him flesh and Bone
[28:00] like in Adam see the bride so he's
[28:03] taking us back and typing us all the way
[28:05] back to the beginning with what God is
[28:07] trying to do uh here what he's trying to
[28:09] manifest in the end time is he's trying
[28:11] to bring into light what he's been
[28:12] trying to do all
[28:14] along and if we go back to Genesis uh we
[28:18] can turn to Genesis but we're just going
[28:19] to uh uh uh let's turn to Genesis 5 but
[28:22] while you're turning there we'll re
[28:24] we'll just remind ourselves of the time
[28:26] when God is making man and he first
[28:28] makes man a spirit man and he he says
[28:32] let us make man in our image and he
[28:33] makes him a spirit man and then in order
[28:36] for that Spirit man who had control over
[28:38] the Earth and brother Benham said that
[28:40] Spirit man had control over the Earth
[28:41] like the Holy Ghost uh brooding over the
[28:44] Earth so he was in spirit form he was
[28:46] controlling the Earth but the Earth his
[28:48] subjects of his brooding could not
[28:50] interact with this spirit in a tangible
[28:53] way so he took that life and he put it
[28:55] in the flesh so that in the body of of
[28:58] Adam's flesh he could express the life
[29:01] that they couldn't touch before that
[29:02] they now could touch and interact with
[29:04] in a different way so the body was meant
[29:07] to express the life
[29:09] amen amen so then God finds that the man
[29:13] is lonely so he takes this he says not
[29:15] good that man shall dwell alone and
[29:17] brother bam said he was lonely because
[29:19] God was lonely so God is just
[29:20] manifesting what's in his mind he's
[29:22] working it down and everything he's
[29:25] doing everything that God is doing is is
[29:28] is telling us the mystery of his mind
[29:31] yeah amen and it laid in mystery form
[29:33] for so long until a prophet could go
[29:35] into the back part of God's mind and
[29:37] then take the works that he did and
[29:39] attach it to the thought of his mind and
[29:41] then bring a clarity through the entire
[29:43] Bible showing us what God was trying to
[29:45] manifest what he his original desire was
[29:48] he began to work it down and as the
[29:50] great sculptor began to display his
[29:52] Masterpiece he was showing us what his
[29:54] great desire was amen and so then he
[29:57] sees that the man is lonely amen and he
[29:59] and he takes from that man a a portion
[30:02] of the man to make a help meat for him
[30:05] to make the woman amen and when he makes
[30:07] the woman a a brother bham is very
[30:09] specific in the fact that she was flesh
[30:13] of Adam amen she was Spirit of Adam she
[30:17] she was uh uh she was Adam reproduced in
[30:21] female
[30:22] form amen so we find that go you know
[30:25] God wants to make a help me can't find a
[30:28] suitable help me this is in Genesis
[30:29] chapter 2 he tries bringing up the
[30:31] animals he tries everything and
[30:33] nothing's found suitable amen so what
[30:35] God does is lays Adam down and says the
[30:37] only suitable help meat for you is
[30:39] something that comes from you amen so he
[30:42] took portions off of Adam Amen to make
[30:45] the woman and then he United him back
[30:47] together and after United him back
[30:49] together he looked at all he had done
[30:50] and all he had made and he said behold
[30:52] it is very good and then what did he do
[30:56] he went to rest why did he go to rest
[30:59] because his work was done because his
[31:01] Masterpiece was finished his his his
[31:03] mystery of his mind was now on
[31:05] display so he went to rest but I want to
[31:09] look in Genesis 5 at just one scripture
[31:11] here because this will be uh to me this
[31:14] is a a really important scripture and
[31:18] it's worth noting Genesis 5 verse one
[31:23] this is the book of the generations of
[31:24] Adam in the day God created man and the
[31:27] like Ness of God made he him male and
[31:30] female created he them and blessed them
[31:32] and called their name Adam in the day
[31:35] when they were created we going to go
[31:37] back over this slowly this is the book
[31:38] of the generations of Adam and the day
[31:41] God created man in the likeness of God
[31:44] made he him so man was made to reflect
[31:48] God amen amen then that reflection of
[31:52] God because he was originally Spirit
[31:53] form was placed in the flesh so that in
[31:56] this dimension
[31:58] there would be a reflection of
[32:02] God and then he made them male and
[32:06] female he created he them this is plural
[32:10] and blessed them and called their name
[32:12] Adam this is
[32:15] singular in the day when they were
[32:17] created amen and from this story I would
[32:21] like to propose to
[32:23] you that Adam lived in two bodies
[32:29] amen I hope you can see that in the
[32:32] scripture because when you look at the
[32:34] body of the male what when we come to
[32:37] Genesis chapter 5 when we come
[32:40] preall what would you call that body
[32:44] you'd call it
[32:45] Adam but when you come to the female
[32:48] what would you call that
[32:50] body you would call it Adam there's
[32:52] nothing else you could call it right
[32:54] because it was Adam it was Adam it it
[32:57] was Adam reproduced in another form amen
[33:01] and United back together amen it was
[33:03] Adam male and Adam
[33:06] female I hope I hope that doesn't throw
[33:08] anybody I I hope we can put our
[33:10] spiritual jackets on but what God the
[33:12] work that God did amen is he split Adam
[33:15] into two bodies and so Adam now dwelt in
[33:19] two
[33:21] bodies I know it sounds odd I mean I
[33:23] know it but but but it's the truth
[33:26] friends
[33:28] yes in the message Oneness brother Venom
[33:31] said and if you'll notice how that Eve
[33:34] was United with Adam she became part of
[33:36] him God did you notice in Genesis 1:27
[33:39] he created man male and female created
[33:41] he them both male and female when it
[33:43] come to being in the spirit of feminist
[33:46] and masculine then God took from his
[33:48] side a rib did you notice the body part
[33:50] was a byproduct but not the spirit the
[33:53] body part of the woman was a byproduct
[33:54] after the creation had been finished God
[33:57] took from the side of Adam a rib made a
[33:59] woman but not the spirit the spirit was
[34:01] part of Adam for he was both man and
[34:05] woman spiritually speaking both
[34:06] masculine and feminis now don't you see
[34:09] the great picture we in flesh are
[34:11] different we are like a byproduct a
[34:14] created being by holy wedlock but in
[34:17] spirit we are Sons and Daughters not
[34:19] some other Spirit but the spirit of the
[34:22] Living God we are in his likeness in his
[34:24] unity in the perfect image of the Living
[34:27] God because we become Sons and Daughters
[34:29] not separated but the Same Spirit the
[34:31] same God the same person joined in
[34:34] wedlock to Eternal see how God planned
[34:37] it that we should be not a different but
[34:39] him not some other being of some other
[34:42] tribe but a real Union and offspring of
[34:44] the almighty done by a holy union now
[34:47] the body comes from mother and father
[34:49] but the spirit comes from God God
[34:52] separated himself as Adam was separated
[34:55] on the day of Pentecost we find the the
[34:57] Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separated
[35:00] itself and setting upon each member of
[35:02] that church God putting himself
[35:07] together why by the spirit amen by his
[35:10] spirit amen now coming back upon the
[35:13] attributes of his his sons and daughters
[35:15] and what was God doing he was putting
[35:17] himself back together on the day of
[35:19] Pentecost then when the group of people
[35:21] together what does it do it brings back
[35:23] the unified body of the Lord Jesus
[35:26] coming together amen
[35:28] so as Adam as as Adam was taken uh was
[35:34] Eve was taken from Adam she was she was
[35:38] she was Adam's
[35:40] spirit because he said he split the
[35:42] feminist Spirit from the masculine so
[35:44] that was all Adam's Spirit yeah and he
[35:47] took a a portion of that Spirit to
[35:49] feminine and placed it into another
[35:51] vessel amen and so now the life that was
[35:55] in that vessel was Adam's life yeah amen
[35:58] and it was called woman and before the
[36:01] fall before the separation they were
[36:02] both named Adam amen right these are
[36:05] things we understand amen I'm going over
[36:07] it slow amen for a reason because you
[36:10] know we get to know these things like we
[36:13] know them but then they have to be known
[36:16] amen it has to become more than
[36:19] knowledge because knowledge doesn't
[36:21] change our life amen but when it becomes
[36:23] a living reality to us it begins to
[36:25] change the way we conduct ourselves the
[36:27] way operate the way we view the world
[36:29] around us when this thing becomes a
[36:31] living reality to me amen it'll change
[36:34] my perspective on everything around me
[36:36] amen so we have to go go over these
[36:38] things and understand them and put them
[36:40] in the scripture and in the context of
[36:42] the message so that we understand the
[36:44] living reality that we are a part of now
[36:48] we can't look at this body and listen
[36:51] it's not that I could say this body I is
[36:54] is Jesus Christ because this body has to
[36:56] be made over amen right right but this
[37:00] body God redeemed and he and he
[37:03] sanctifies the spirit inside then fills
[37:05] us with his own spirit so that he can
[37:08] use this body to dwell in to manifest
[37:11] his life in this Dimension so that he
[37:13] can once again become
[37:16] tangible prise God Amen so we we know
[37:21] that in order for this to come to
[37:22] Perfection our atoms have to
[37:24] change absolutely and so this thing is
[37:27] still corrupt but even with it corrupt
[37:30] that the price of redemption was paid
[37:33] and the sanctifying power of the Holy
[37:34] Ghost comes so that he can use a
[37:36] perverted body to still manifest his
[37:39] life all
[37:41] right
[37:43] brother uh when we when we look at
[37:46] Genesis 1:26 I've quoted it to you he
[37:49] says God said let us make man in our
[37:50] image after our likeness let them have
[37:53] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[37:55] over the foul of the air and over the
[37:56] cattle and over all Earth and over every
[37:58] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[37:59] Earth so God created man in his own
[38:01] image in the image of God created he him
[38:04] male and female created he them so what
[38:07] was the purpose of God creating man God
[38:09] created Man In His Image to reflect his
[38:12] image amen and then God took him and put
[38:15] him in flesh so that in the Physical
[38:17] Realm of this Dimension there will be a
[38:19] reflection of the life of God in this
[38:22] Dimension all right we're all on the
[38:24] same page I hope and then brother M goes
[38:27] on to say and now remember you
[38:29] Christians were his thoughts before
[38:31] there was a world and you are the
[38:34] manifestation of his thinking before
[38:37] there even was a world you were in
[38:38] Christ amen in God in the beginning that
[38:40] makes you then you see his subjects and
[38:43] the whole thing is God himself
[38:46] materializing himself tangible so he
[38:49] could be
[38:50] handled hey that is an absolute that's a
[38:53] mouthful and it's something beyond our
[38:56] thinking but it's nothing but the truth
[38:58] amen and God the whole thing the what is
[39:01] the whole what is the whole mystery of
[39:03] God what is the whole Revelation 10:7
[39:05] what's the unveiling of God all about
[39:07] it's about this truth amen the whole
[39:10] thing is God himself materializing
[39:12] himself tangible so he could be handled
[39:14] see seen and so forth and that's what
[39:17] God is the whole thing amen oh praise
[39:20] God so so we see that that God wanted to
[39:25] materialize himself God's original plan
[39:28] was have an earth inhabited with sons
[39:30] and daughters and have Fellowship as a
[39:33] brother B said as a family upon the
[39:35] Earth that's what God want to do portion
[39:36] himself out into a family amen and have
[39:39] a whole earth inhabited with his sons
[39:40] and daughters and be in Fellowship all
[39:43] together as a family of God upon the
[39:44] Earth that was the original intent
[39:46] that's what he created man for that's
[39:48] why he told him to multiply and
[39:49] replenish to bring forth amen the god
[39:52] seed the race upon the Earth for God to
[39:54] Fellowship as a family amen and it's not
[39:58] if we could think of it this way I I
[40:00] hope I can say this right listen I get
[40:02] so nervous sometimes when we go to talk
[40:04] about supernatural things because you're
[40:06] trying to use human language and I don't
[40:08] want to put your thinking in the wrong
[40:09] spot or cause you to think in error
[40:11] because I don't even know how to explain
[40:13] some of these things that are realities
[40:15] to us but I'm depending on the spirit of
[40:17] God to make it real in your soul amen
[40:20] you Lord because it wasn't as though
[40:22] that God and and and and if we could
[40:25] just think I don't even know how to
[40:26] think of this right but God wanted to
[40:28] become tangible and he wanted to
[40:30] Fellowship as a family upon the Earth so
[40:32] it wasn't so much that God wanted to
[40:34] come down to fellowship with his family
[40:37] on the Earth but he wanted to Fellowship
[40:40] as a family on the earth amen so what
[40:43] did that mean that means if we would
[40:45] have come forth the right way if we
[40:46] would have come forth amen without the
[40:48] fall without the curse and we would have
[40:50] we would have come the right way then
[40:53] when I fellowship with you and you
[40:55] fellowship with me it'll be good God
[40:57] fellowshipping as his family am God
[41:00] fellowshipping with God why because
[41:02] you're an attribute of God I'm an
[41:04] attribute of God I'm an offspring of God
[41:07] you're an offspring of God I'm part of
[41:09] God being tangible you're part of God
[41:11] being tangible and and and when my hand
[41:13] and my hand have Fellowship together
[41:15] amen it's it's my it's Chad having
[41:17] fellowship with
[41:20] Chad that's God fellowshipping it's not
[41:23] a separate being wanting to come down
[41:25] and and just have no God wanted to he
[41:28] wanted to be in Fellowship as a family
[41:30] upon the
[41:32] Earth
[41:34] amen praise be to
[41:37] God let's go to John
[41:44] 14 so the the thing in all of this that
[41:47] we laid this Foundation I want to
[41:49] highlight that man was
[41:52] created to manifest God cuz he was made
[41:56] in God's image
[41:57] then he was given dominion over the
[41:59] Earth then he was put in flesh upon the
[42:01] earth and the whole reflection was to
[42:04] reflect the life of
[42:05] God in John 14 let's turn
[42:10] there John
[42:12] 14 verse
[42:16] 8 Philip saith unto him Lord show us the
[42:19] father and it sufficeth
[42:21] us Jesus saith unto him have I been so
[42:24] long time with you and yet hast thou not
[42:27] known me Phillip he that has seen me has
[42:30] seen the father and how sayest thou then
[42:33] show us the
[42:36] father believest not that that I am in
[42:40] the father and the father in me the
[42:42] words that I speak unto you I speak not
[42:45] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[42:46] in me he doeth The Works believe me that
[42:49] I am in the father and the father in me
[42:52] or else believe me for the very Works
[42:55] sake so
[42:59] the eternal spirit of God God is the
[43:02] eternal spirit he cannot be seen by
[43:06] man that's his original form brother B
[43:08] tells us and in Christ came from the
[43:11] light which no man can approach unto and
[43:13] no man can see no man can behold no man
[43:16] has seen the father but the Son and
[43:18] whomsoever the son will declare him
[43:20] to so Philip is saying well show us the
[43:25] father I want to see him
[43:27] and and Jesus is saying Phillip don't
[43:30] you know me when you've seen me you've
[43:32] seen the
[43:33] father now
[43:40] now it's a head
[43:43] scratcher what you looked at when you
[43:45] looked at Jesus was actually the
[43:47] son he was the son amen but he said when
[43:51] you see me you see the
[43:52] father he was the son in a form of flesh
[43:55] but God in his original for form is
[43:58] invisible spirit that no man can see
[44:01] amen so what was Jesus Christ he was a
[44:06] reflection of his father who was made
[44:08] the word made material put here on Earth
[44:12] so that it could reflect the life of his
[44:13] father so that when you see the son what
[44:16] you really see is a reflection of the
[44:19] father so he was a reflection of the
[44:23] father in the flesh form of son
[44:27] and we know it's God's body it's the god
[44:29] that body built to dwell in but that
[44:31] that body was actually form of sun yeah
[44:34] and he says when you see me you see the
[44:36] the father why because it's the father
[44:38] that's in me manifesting out through me
[44:41] and when you see the manifestation of
[44:43] the father through these elements what
[44:45] you're seeing is the life of the father
[44:49] you're seeing his life amen you're
[44:51] seeing uh elements of the earth created
[44:54] Earth amen that's been put together to
[44:56] make a body but really what you're
[44:58] seeing is you're not seeing the body
[45:00] you're seeing the life behind the body
[45:02] as the life animates the body and that's
[45:05] the father
[45:08] amen praise
[45:10] God in the leoan church age brother
[45:13] bram's making a statement and he's
[45:15] talking about godhead the subject is
[45:17] godhead but and the Oneness of the
[45:19] godhead but I pulled a statement out and
[45:21] i' I've read it to you before but I want
[45:22] to pull the statement out because it it
[45:24] it's it's been highlighted to me in my
[45:27] own Spirit as I look at this he says the
[45:29] New Testament does not reveal another
[45:31] God it is a further revelation of the
[45:33] one and same God Christ did not come
[45:36] down to make himself known he did not
[45:39] come to reveal the son he came to reveal
[45:42] and make known the
[45:43] father he never talked about two Gods he
[45:46] talked about one God so brother bman
[45:48] this subject is talking about the
[45:50] Oneness of the godhead that's his
[45:51] subject but the the what what stood out
[45:54] to me is he did not come to reveal the
[45:56] son amen but what was being revealed was
[46:00] the Sun what was the manifestation son
[46:03] what was the body son what was what he
[46:06] came to be the Son of God Amen we
[46:10] understand that amen but the Son of God
[46:12] coming to Earth Jesus Christ didn't come
[46:15] to manifest son he came to manifest
[46:18] father even though he was in the form of
[46:20] son amen this is so important hey it's
[46:23] going to come right to you and I some of
[46:25] you already made the jump but this is
[46:27] absolutely pertinent to us because we're
[46:29] supposed to live that same life that was
[46:31] in Christ is supposed to be living in us
[46:33] that means we did not come to manifest
[46:35] ourselves we did not come listen we did
[46:38] not come to manifest bride even though
[46:41] we're in the manifestation of bride even
[46:43] though we're in a Min membered bride
[46:44] body our job and objective on this Earth
[46:47] is not to manifest bride not to manifest
[46:50] self but to manifest Christ amen the
[46:54] same thing Jesus did amen so now we want
[46:57] to get to the place and I pray that God
[47:00] by his Spirit brings us to the place
[47:02] where you can say Amen show me Jesus
[47:04] Christ and we can say have we been so
[47:06] long with you that you don't know us
[47:08] when you see me you see Christ amen not
[47:11] this thing right here but there's a life
[47:13] that's animating this be the life Behind
[47:16] the Veil The Veil is just what happened
[47:19] when my mom and dad come together and
[47:21] put elements together and then I ate the
[47:23] food of the earth and the elements of
[47:25] the Earth come together to make a Veil
[47:27] amen the veil amen is not I I'm going to
[47:31] say this wrong but I the veil is not God
[47:35] the veil is not Jesus Christ right amen
[47:39] the veil is the Tabernacle the temple
[47:42] that he's redeemed back that he's
[47:43] purchased so that he can clean so that
[47:45] he can step behind that Veil and
[47:47] manifest himself until where the world
[47:50] doesn't they see a veil they see Bride
[47:52] form they see a church they see a bunch
[47:54] of people gathered together worshiping
[47:56] under the the truth of the hour but what
[47:58] they're supposed to see what's supposed
[48:00] to be displayed is not the bride but the
[48:04] husband amen the
[48:07] bridegroom praise be to
[48:12] God he says brother bam in this message
[48:16] the identified Masterpiece of God said
[48:20] he came to reflect the
[48:22] father and the father was the
[48:25] word now I feel real religious he came
[48:28] to reflect the father's word God said he
[48:31] would be here there and there he was the
[48:33] perfect Masterpiece of God's Great
[48:35] handiwork he was the perfect reflection
[48:38] of
[48:39] him amen and if I could say this way it
[48:42] was the perfect reflection of him in a
[48:45] body of Flesh taken from the
[48:47] earth I could say it that
[48:49] way in the message things that are to be
[48:53] he said now if we are those attributes
[48:55] of God we cannot live by creat s we
[48:57] cannot live by
[48:59] denominationalism we must live by the
[49:01] word because the bride is part of the
[49:03] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[49:05] husband therefore we must be the word
[49:08] bride and what is the word bride the
[49:11] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[49:14] a Creed or denomination but a living
[49:17] Oracle of God a living attribute of God
[49:19] displaying to the world the attributes
[49:22] of God in the formation of the Bride
[49:24] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[49:27] we're now
[49:28] living so I want to know what's
[49:30] different between this and the
[49:32] manifestation through Jesus
[49:35] Christ because he was the fullness of
[49:38] the word all the attribut of God bundled
[49:40] up into one body of Flesh and he came to
[49:43] manifest the father he come to manifest
[49:44] the word not himself amen and now all
[49:47] that was in God he poured into Christ
[49:50] and all that was in Christ he poured
[49:51] into his bride what is the bride what is
[49:54] the word bride he said what is the word
[49:55] bride and amen it's that portion of the
[49:58] word God's allowed to be manifest in
[50:00] this day but what is the bride supposed
[50:01] to manifest she's not supposed to
[50:03] manifest herself she's in Bride form yes
[50:05] many member body but she's supposed to
[50:07] manifest Jesus Christ his life not
[50:12] ours see we we we know these things this
[50:16] this is not I'm not bringing to you
[50:18] anything that's brand new this is like a
[50:19] review but it's a review that I hope has
[50:22] impact on us because we've known these
[50:24] things but we've taken it as concept and
[50:27] it's a concept and it's a beautiful
[50:28] concept and it's exciting and I'm
[50:30] thrilled to be part of it but I want to
[50:31] be more than a concept I want it to be
[50:33] more than than than than a correct
[50:35] teaching I wanted to come down to where
[50:38] this actual flesh of Mind actually
[50:41] becomes a manifestation a temple a
[50:43] vessel a a tangible part of the earth
[50:46] that he can get control of and manifest
[50:48] himself yeah not me so I stopped
[50:51] thinking about me remember brother
[50:53] brandham said if I can get William
[50:54] brandham out of the way he can come and
[50:56] do things William bram's never thought
[50:57] of that is what I'm longing for friends
[51:00] I'm longing for God to come and do
[51:02] something that's not my agenda my mind
[51:05] my idea my concept protecting myself or
[51:09] promoting myself or or showing myself I
[51:11] want to get beyond that friends I want
[51:13] to get to the place where I can just
[51:15] surrender to the spot where it's not me
[51:17] where I can really come to the place not
[51:19] because of religious terminology and say
[51:22] well it's not me that did it it was
[51:23] Christ in me that did it but where I can
[51:25] really get to the place where listen
[51:26] brother I'm as shocked as you are that
[51:28] that just
[51:32] happened do we get to the to the reality
[51:36] sets in not religious rhetoric but we
[51:38] get to the reality that says listen
[51:40] there was no way I and myself could have
[51:43] done that that wasn't me that was him
[51:46] when you saw that that wasn't me that
[51:48] was the father that was my bridegroom
[51:50] that was Jesus
[51:53] Christ and then we can be honest the
[51:55] other way when we blow it we can say
[51:56] that wasn't Jesus Christ that was
[51:58] me
[52:01] like do where we get to be
[52:03] real that's what we
[52:07] want he says in the message
[52:09] identification again he says then see
[52:11] God come down came down and the
[52:14] character of God was
[52:15] Christ he was the reflection he was God
[52:19] made visible notice God made visible in
[52:23] the beginning was God he wasn't even God
[52:25] then no God is an object of worship only
[52:28] thing he was was the Eternal and in him
[52:30] was attributes and those attributes were
[52:32] thoughts and those thoughts were
[52:34] expressed to words and word was made
[52:37] manifest what is it it's all God
[52:40] becoming tangible you are a part of
[52:46] God when God wanted to make Man In His
[52:49] Image he made him male and
[52:53] female and that expression as it came
[52:55] down through wound up in two
[52:59] bodies the man and the woman and their
[53:02] name was
[53:03] Adam reflecting what God was going to do
[53:07] in Redemption where he once again was
[53:10] going to reflect himself on Earth and a
[53:12] body amen and that reflection of himself
[53:15] was going to be in two
[53:17] bodies the body of his son and then from
[53:20] his son was going to be taken a
[53:22] spirit and that Spirit was going to
[53:25] enter into his bride body amen and it
[53:28] wasn't going to be a different life it
[53:30] was going to be his life in her amen so
[53:34] that now he would dwell in two
[53:40] bodies amen do you ever feel like it's
[53:43] do you ever feel like it's beyond our
[53:44] understanding do you ever feel like do
[53:47] you ever say something like that and
[53:48] you're like how can I say that amen
[53:51] happens to me all the time how can I say
[53:53] that but it's the truth it's it's odd to
[53:57] the normal run of the Gospel it's
[53:58] different to the way people normally
[54:01] talk about it but it's true to the
[54:03] scriptures because it was Paul who said
[54:05] we are his body his flesh and his bone
[54:08] we are one and Christ is a many membered
[54:11] body so it's it's Christ life in his in
[54:14] his body manifesting
[54:17] himself brother B goes on in Christ is
[54:20] the mystery of God revealed to tell us
[54:21] this but what he wanted to do he loved
[54:24] fatherhood for he was a father and the
[54:27] only way he could express it was to
[54:29] become a son of man that's the reason
[54:31] Jesus kept saying son of man see they
[54:33] didn't know what he was talking about
[54:35] many of them but now you get it see he
[54:38] wanted to express himself that was his
[54:40] one of his great three-fold purposes was
[54:42] to express himself identify himself with
[54:44] human beings to reveal hisself in Christ
[54:48] secondly to have preeminence in his body
[54:50] of Believers that is his bride that he
[54:52] might live in people now he could do
[54:54] that in Adam and Eve but sin separated
[54:57] them so now there had to be some way to
[55:00] get it back
[55:01] again that's what God could do in Adam
[55:04] and Eve what what could he do he could
[55:06] manifest himself he could manifest
[55:09] himself tangible in human beings but sin
[55:11] separated it so he had to work a Plan of
[55:14] Redemption Amen to redeem it back to
[55:16] what his original plan
[55:17] was and when the the previous quote that
[55:20] we
[55:21] read he
[55:23] said in him was attribute
[55:27] and those attributes are thoughts and
[55:30] those thoughts are expressed to words
[55:31] and word was made manifest see it's all
[55:34] God becoming tangible and you're part of
[55:36] God why you're part of the word if
[55:39] you're part of the word you're an
[55:40] attribute and an attribute is part of
[55:42] God so when we talk about the seed
[55:45] that's inside of us brother BM said that
[55:47] was meant to be
[55:49] you as God would portion himself out to
[55:52] be a family upon the
[55:54] Earth so really that attribute was meant
[55:57] to be which brother B said is the true
[55:59] you is actually
[56:02] who where did that attribute come from
[56:06] it's an attribute
[56:07] of God
[56:10] Amen it's God wanting to manifest
[56:14] himself and display himself on the earth
[56:16] as a
[56:18] family so what right do I have to make
[56:22] it all about
[56:24] me I have an attribute I have a seed I'm
[56:26] a seed gen of God I'm elect that just
[56:28] means you're a part of God you're an
[56:32] attribute of God that God wants to
[56:34] express on this Earth that this is why
[56:37] brother B says you have no thought
[56:38] coming you have no right to your own
[56:40] thought you have no right to hijack this
[56:42] great Plan of Redemption and make it
[56:44] about yourself or me make it about
[56:46] myself because it's not my life it's not
[56:48] my attribute it's not my word it's not
[56:51] my thought it's
[56:52] his and he's so wonderful that he'll
[56:55] share his life with a family and we can
[56:58] become part of that expression and part
[57:00] of that family but it's all him it's all
[57:03] him it's all about him it's all him
[57:05] connecting dividing himself and then
[57:08] connecting himself back together as a
[57:09] family and when I realize this then I
[57:12] realize that that it's not about me this
[57:15] whole thing is not about me and when I
[57:17] say me I'm talking about whatever came
[57:20] together and made chemistry in my mom
[57:21] and dad and an Earthly Spirit God gave
[57:23] to it at Birth and I've identified that
[57:25] as me all of these years it has nothing
[57:27] to do with that it has everything to do
[57:29] with this life of God down on the inside
[57:31] and it's all about him
[57:33] amen and so when that when that true
[57:37] concept comes down then I realize I
[57:40] didn't do anything I didn't earn
[57:42] anything I I I I can't lose anything I
[57:46] didn't start anything I'm not going to
[57:47] be the one that finishes anything it's
[57:49] going to be his life bringing forth his
[57:52] word in his season according to his
[57:54] thinking yeah amen so now I can't if if
[57:58] I get the real revelation of this I
[58:01] can't get puffed up amen only a false
[58:05] revelation of this can get me thinking
[58:07] I'm Elite in some
[58:09] way but the true revelation of this will
[58:12] take the me that has conscious thinking
[58:15] the me that came from a union between
[58:17] Mom and Dad and that me part of that me
[58:19] part of me yeah not the original me part
[58:22] god part of me but the me part of me
[58:25] amen
[58:26] can just say oh
[58:29] God this is why we can feel so grateful
[58:33] this is why we can we can receive Grace
[58:35] and that we can say oh God I'm so
[58:38] thankful that you chose me and listen
[58:40] you can say God I'm so thankful you
[58:42] chose me and we say why me and I can't
[58:44] believe it's me and all of that well the
[58:46] Original Seed part of you doesn't think
[58:48] like that the Original Seed part of you
[58:50] was with God from before you're not so
[58:52] that seed's not surprised it's part of
[58:54] God it's redeemed it's a child of that
[58:56] seed is not but it's this other part of
[58:58] you that's looking at this great plan
[59:00] say God oh how can this be this is most
[59:02] amazing and then and then we can then we
[59:05] can surrender this outside part to the
[59:08] inside part because we realize it had
[59:10] nothing to do with this part of me this
[59:12] was the what was meant to be me which
[59:14] was actually God being nice
[59:17] enough I I hate to say it that way
[59:19] because that's that's bad language
[59:21] that's that that I don't even know that
[59:23] it properly expresses what God's
[59:24] thinking but God being nice enough to
[59:26] say I'm going to share my life in
[59:28] multiplied form amen so that I have an
[59:31] expression of me but that expression of
[59:33] me will be joy and pleasure as it
[59:35] expresses to one
[59:39] another and then we can separate what's
[59:42] real from what's the
[59:46] veil
[59:49] amen praise be to
[59:54] God now brother B tells
[59:57] us
[59:59] uh when in the when he had the
[1:00:02] experience of the Angel time to pick up
[1:00:04] his pen and write he wrote some things
[1:00:07] and it wasn't brother
[1:00:08] brandham it was his
[1:00:10] hand and it was his pen but it was
[1:00:14] another power that was
[1:00:19] writing so when we get to this section
[1:00:21] of the scripture we can't even say
[1:00:22] brother bam said
[1:00:26] yeah can't even really say brother
[1:00:28] Benham wrote although he
[1:00:31] wrote but I think that's such a clear
[1:00:33] picture of what the whole message really
[1:00:35] is the whole Bible yeah men of old as
[1:00:39] they were Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:40] wrote the Bible am so who wrote the
[1:00:43] Bible Well men of old no the Holy Ghost
[1:00:46] yes he just used the hand of men of old
[1:00:49] that were anointed of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:52] yeah oh if this could become our reality
[1:00:56] if this could become what's true to
[1:01:01] us and if it could become the
[1:01:03] manifestation of Our Lives God will
[1:01:06] finally be accomplishing what he set out
[1:01:08] to
[1:01:09] accomplish remember God's three-fold
[1:01:13] plan God had brother B tells us that
[1:01:16] this is a Christ of the mystery of God
[1:01:17] revealed God had one goal one thing he
[1:01:21] wanted to achieve in all the Bible and
[1:01:22] all the characters of The Bible and all
[1:01:23] the stories are declaring that one goal
[1:01:25] that God
[1:01:27] had and then he comes and tells us and
[1:01:30] it comes in a three-fold manner so one
[1:01:32] goal one ambition one desire everything
[1:01:35] he's been doing has to do with this one
[1:01:37] goal and in the three-fold plan the
[1:01:40] first part of it is get preeminence in a
[1:01:42] man because he was started with Adam
[1:01:46] remember amen but Adam he lost the
[1:01:49] preeminence when Adam left the word yeah
[1:01:52] so then he'd been working back through
[1:01:54] his Masterpiece and he finally gets the
[1:01:56] preeminence back in a man when he
[1:01:57] creates his own body and he lives in it
[1:02:00] as son of man Jesus Christ and he
[1:02:03] finished that part in Jesus Christ and
[1:02:06] the second part is to have preeminence
[1:02:09] in a people in a body amen and brother R
[1:02:12] said and he's doing that now right when
[1:02:16] brother R say he's doing that now I say
[1:02:18] Amen he's doing that now right I I may
[1:02:21] be a long ways from where I ought to be
[1:02:23] but the prophet said he's doing that now
[1:02:25] and this is doing that now in
[1:02:27] me
[1:02:29] right and so but that plan now is to get
[1:02:34] preeminence in a man then to get
[1:02:36] preeminence in a body upon the Earth of
[1:02:39] people which would be bridegroom and
[1:02:42] bride male and female and restore back
[1:02:46] lost Eden amen so the whole Bible has
[1:02:50] been godone working this plan so what
[1:02:52] does God want God wants to have
[1:02:54] preeminence in a body yeah the Son and
[1:02:59] the son's
[1:03:01] wife the singular body in the many
[1:03:04] membered body Al together to make up the
[1:03:07] body and and you think what is a body a
[1:03:11] body is a dwelling place for a life so
[1:03:13] that it can be expressed in this earth
[1:03:16] amen I hope that makes
[1:03:18] sense you have a life inside of you and
[1:03:21] that life is more than your
[1:03:23] body because when that life leaves the
[1:03:26] body we can still touch your body we can
[1:03:28] see your body your body can be moved you
[1:03:31] you you have a recognition your face
[1:03:33] stays the same your body can remain
[1:03:35] after the spirit in you leaves amen but
[1:03:37] then it's not animated it's not doing
[1:03:39] anything it's just laying there lifeless
[1:03:41] amen so what was the body for the
[1:03:44] purpose of the body was to manifest the
[1:03:46] life that was on the inside amen that's
[1:03:49] why he has to get preeminence because
[1:03:52] preeminence means he has full control
[1:03:54] when he has full control he can manifest
[1:03:57] through the body the life that's behind
[1:03:59] the body but when he doesn't have full
[1:04:02] control the manifestation is not pure
[1:04:05] because it's mixed our life mixed in
[1:04:07] with his life and all of a sudden we
[1:04:09] begin to display something other than
[1:04:11] the word amen that's why he must get
[1:04:14] preeminence in a body of Believers again
[1:04:16] so that it can be just his life so that
[1:04:19] we can get to the place where just like
[1:04:22] Jesus was when Philip asked him show us
[1:04:24] the father amen where we get to that
[1:04:25] that place and listen friends we may
[1:04:27] never get to the place where we just run
[1:04:29] around and say that I don't I don't I
[1:04:31] don't mean we should get to the place
[1:04:32] where we say hey here it is you've been
[1:04:35] missing it all your
[1:04:36] life but to where that reality is still
[1:04:40] a reality in our lives even if it's not
[1:04:42] said right
[1:04:45] amen
[1:04:46] amen so he could do that in Adam and Eve
[1:04:49] but sin separated
[1:04:50] them and when he comes to pick up your
[1:04:53] pen and write he says the first son Adam
[1:04:56] was the spoken seed word of God he was
[1:04:59] given a bride to reproduce
[1:05:02] himself that is why the bride was given
[1:05:04] to him to reproduce himself to produce
[1:05:07] another Son of God but she fell she fell
[1:05:10] by hybridization she caused him to
[1:05:14] die so we go all the way back to Genesis
[1:05:17] where we were God made
[1:05:20] man the reason he made man he made man
[1:05:24] in his own image and now this man was
[1:05:27] controlling the Earth but he was in the
[1:05:28] image of God so he's reflecting back to
[1:05:30] the Earth the life of God they put him
[1:05:32] in flesh so that those that he were
[1:05:34] ruling over could see who was ruling
[1:05:36] them that's what brother tells us amen
[1:05:40] but then he realizes that he's lonely
[1:05:43] he's not supposed to be alone and then
[1:05:45] he makes help me so he takes his life
[1:05:46] and he makes another body for the life
[1:05:48] that's in Adam and now Adam is split
[1:05:50] between two bodies come back to one to
[1:05:53] be one flesh and two forms one
[1:05:58] flesh but the reason that the woman was
[1:06:01] even created and given to Adam was to
[1:06:04] reproduce Adam amen not to reproduce
[1:06:11] herself her whole purpose her whole
[1:06:15] purpose was to express Adam's
[1:06:20] life and and God for whatever I don't
[1:06:25] want to say for whatever reason I I
[1:06:27] don't I don't know why but I just feel
[1:06:29] like when we get into some of these
[1:06:30] Mysteries I want to be careful with my
[1:06:32] language am but God for a reason that
[1:06:36] was in his mind for a reason of of
[1:06:38] depiction God would not let Adam
[1:06:42] reproduce himself by
[1:06:43] himself he was going he was going to
[1:06:46] create a mechanism where there had to be
[1:06:48] another part of Adam and two coming
[1:06:50] together would be a reproduction of Adam
[1:06:53] again so Adam could be reproduced
[1:06:55] because God is trying to show what his
[1:06:57] great plan is amen so that has
[1:07:00] everything to do now you want to know
[1:07:02] what the bride's purpose is we can go
[1:07:03] back to the beginning and find out what
[1:07:05] the first bride's purpose is so that
[1:07:07] means the bride in this day she is not
[1:07:10] here Amen to declare herself amen she is
[1:07:14] not here to promote herself she's not
[1:07:16] here for herself she is a vessel that
[1:07:19] has been placed here to reproduce her
[1:07:22] husband Amen to reflect him him on the
[1:07:26] Earth
[1:07:27] again so what caused Eve to fall is when
[1:07:32] when a Temptation come along and caused
[1:07:36] Eve to use her own reasoning her own
[1:07:39] ideas and her own lust to do something
[1:07:42] her own way for her own Reason by her
[1:07:46] own intellect amen that's not
[1:07:50] preeminence yeah right that's her
[1:07:53] injecting herself into the equation and
[1:07:56] she wasn't supposed to inject herself
[1:07:58] she was supposed to surrender herself
[1:08:00] and she was supposed to reflect or
[1:08:02] reproduce the life of Adam upon the
[1:08:05] Earth again and so when she began to by
[1:08:08] the Temptation of the serpent in the in
[1:08:11] the garden she began to reason she began
[1:08:15] to deduce she began to have desires and
[1:08:17] now these were her desires and we know
[1:08:20] it was based on a truth she wanted to to
[1:08:22] keep the word of God but she started
[1:08:24] wanting it her for herself she wanted to
[1:08:26] do something her way for herself amen
[1:08:29] something she could do or something she
[1:08:31] could
[1:08:33] accomplish and that Temptation for her
[1:08:36] Amen to to to do something of her own
[1:08:39] mind of her own way of her own thinking
[1:08:41] of reasoning is what caused the fall
[1:08:46] amen same thing that caused the fall in
[1:08:49] every Church age
[1:08:51] right he goes on and and pick up your
[1:08:54] pen and right he said the second son
[1:08:55] Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was
[1:08:57] given a bride like as was Adam but
[1:09:00] before he could marry her she also had
[1:09:01] fallen she like Adam's wife was put to
[1:09:04] the test whether she would believe the
[1:09:05] word of God and live or doubt the word
[1:09:07] and die she doubted she left the word
[1:09:10] she
[1:09:13] died from a little group of the true
[1:09:15] seed of the word God will present Christ
[1:09:17] with the Beloved bride she is Virgin of
[1:09:20] his word she is Virgin because she knows
[1:09:22] no man-made Creeds or dogmas by and
[1:09:24] through the members of the Bride will be
[1:09:25] fulfilled all that was promised of God
[1:09:27] to be made manifest in the
[1:09:31] Virgin The Word of Promise came to the
[1:09:33] Virgin Mary but the Word of Promise was
[1:09:35] he himself to be made manifest amen so I
[1:09:40] ask you Luke Chapter 2 is it about
[1:09:45] Mary or is it about Jesus amen amen yeah
[1:09:50] it's not about
[1:09:51] Mary it was never supposed to be about
[1:09:54] Mary he said a virgin shall conceive and
[1:09:56] and a son will be given and and it's all
[1:09:58] about God God see God keeps working his
[1:10:02] plan the same way he keep what he
[1:10:04] started with is what he he keeps showing
[1:10:06] us something every time so when it came
[1:10:08] time for him to get preeminence in a man
[1:10:10] and represent himself on Earth and a
[1:10:12] body of Flesh so that we could see a
[1:10:14] perfect reflection of the father he came
[1:10:16] and he didn't just gather up molecules
[1:10:18] and dust and everything and pack it
[1:10:20] together and say this is it but no he
[1:10:22] came and formed it in the womb of a
[1:10:24] woman so now he needed another vessel
[1:10:27] and that other vessel was going to
[1:10:29] produce himself on the earth amen
[1:10:33] because it was part of the promised word
[1:10:35] so then I I I ask you this question what
[1:10:38] did Mary do to reproduce Christ on the
[1:10:42] earth amen what works did she do what
[1:10:45] part of the Bible did she study
[1:10:48] what what effort did she listen she she
[1:10:51] had I don't want to say she had nothing
[1:10:53] to do with it she did have something to
[1:10:54] do with it and we'll get to that in a
[1:10:56] minute but but when when the fall in the
[1:10:59] beginning happened it was because that
[1:11:01] vessel that was meant to help reproduce
[1:11:04] Adam upon the Earth that vessel started
[1:11:06] wanting to get ahead of God's program
[1:11:08] and figure out a way and find a way and
[1:11:10] take their own idea and do something and
[1:11:12] then she was trying listen the eve
[1:11:16] wasn't dirty and bad and wicked Eve was
[1:11:19] trying to accomplish the plan of God Eve
[1:11:22] was trying to do the works of God but
[1:11:24] she she I don't know if she got nervous
[1:11:27] I don't know if she was worried about
[1:11:28] the time element I don't know if she
[1:11:30] just got overly eager I don't know what
[1:11:32] the motivation was behind it but she was
[1:11:34] tempted and tempted by her own lust and
[1:11:37] she decid or she was trapped and tricked
[1:11:39] into the in the in in the thinking that
[1:11:42] she had to do something and if she would
[1:11:44] do something it would further the plan
[1:11:46] of God and in her doing something to
[1:11:49] help the plan of God she ruined the plan
[1:11:52] of God yes
[1:11:56] because God didn't need her to do
[1:11:59] anything he just needed her vessel
[1:12:02] amen now when he comes to the Virgin
[1:12:05] Mary amen what's he going to do he's
[1:12:07] going to reproduce himself upon the
[1:12:09] Earth Amen in a son that's going to be a
[1:12:12] perfect reflection of his life and what
[1:12:15] does he need he needs a vessel but he
[1:12:18] doesn't need a vessel with an idea he
[1:12:21] doesn't need a vessel with a Works
[1:12:22] program he doesn't need a vessel amen
[1:12:24] that thinks she's something special
[1:12:26] right so what he does is he sends the
[1:12:29] angel Gabriel to a little virgin from an
[1:12:31] outway Place who's nobody amen and what
[1:12:34] does he do he tells her hey thou are
[1:12:36] highly favored well hey that was a shock
[1:12:38] to
[1:12:39] her I mean she probably figured her
[1:12:41] family likes her and Joseph likes her
[1:12:43] but she didn't know she was highly
[1:12:44] favored in heaven right and she was a
[1:12:47] chosen vessel and all of these things
[1:12:49] that was a shock to her she hadn't
[1:12:51] earned her way to it worked her way up
[1:12:53] to it become super good that she could
[1:12:54] be part of it she was part of the
[1:12:56] predestinated plan of God and what he
[1:12:58] needed was a vessel that would stay out
[1:13:01] of his way and believe his
[1:13:04] word amen all he needed there was only
[1:13:07] one thing God needed from Mary only one
[1:13:10] thing he needed her to accept his word
[1:13:14] to her and surrender her her life and
[1:13:18] let the word do the work inside of her
[1:13:21] amen that's all he needed he didn't need
[1:13:24] he didn't need her to go on a preaching
[1:13:25] campaign he didn't need all he needed
[1:13:28] was a vessel that he had chosen amen not
[1:13:31] to hinder what he was going to do
[1:13:34] because there was nothing that Mary
[1:13:35] could
[1:13:36] do but nothing would have happened if
[1:13:39] Mary didn't accept his word to
[1:13:43] her so what did he need from Mary he
[1:13:46] needed
[1:13:48] Faith he needed somebody who would
[1:13:50] believe the message of the Angel and
[1:13:53] Mary believed
[1:13:55] then he needed somebody that would just
[1:13:59] surrender and that's what he got she
[1:14:01] said be it unto me according to Thy
[1:14:05] word not my thinking not my idea not how
[1:14:09] I thought this was going to come to pass
[1:14:12] right amen but be it unto me according
[1:14:15] to Thy word yeah and when he got a
[1:14:19] vessel that would believe the Angel's
[1:14:22] message which was the word of God and
[1:14:25] would surrender herself to that message
[1:14:28] without injecting her own thinking then
[1:14:31] he had a vessel that he could use to
[1:14:34] reproduce himself on the
[1:14:37] earth do we get the picture
[1:14:40] amen so in pick up your pen and write
[1:14:43] the angel of the Lord guides his hand to
[1:14:47] write that through the members of the
[1:14:50] Bride will be fulfilled all that was
[1:14:52] promised of God to be made manifest in
[1:14:54] the virgin what was promised of God to
[1:14:56] be made manifest in the Virgin it would
[1:14:58] be the manifestation of the son who is a
[1:15:01] reflection of the father
[1:15:05] amen praise God Amen he says the Word of
[1:15:10] Promise came to the Virgin Mary but the
[1:15:12] Word of Promise was he himself to be
[1:15:16] made
[1:15:17] manifest want to ask you a question has
[1:15:21] the Word of Promise come to us through
[1:15:24] an angel like visitation in this
[1:15:26] thing what is that Word of Promise That
[1:15:30] Word of Promise is himself to be made
[1:15:33] manifest what does he need us to do
[1:15:35] friends what does he need you and I to
[1:15:37] do he needs us to say I believe that's
[1:15:40] the truth
[1:15:41] amen not that we don't ever ask any
[1:15:44] questions Mary said how can this
[1:15:46] be seeing I know not a man like I don't
[1:15:50] understand how you could do this I don't
[1:15:52] understand how it can be me and then the
[1:15:55] answer he gave her was quite simple he
[1:15:57] said the Holy Ghost will overshadow you
[1:15:59] well that I mean that doesn't really
[1:16:00] explain how she's going to conceive
[1:16:01] knowing no man but he said it's not
[1:16:04] going to be your power it's not going to
[1:16:07] be any Man's power it's going to be my
[1:16:11] power for how is this going to be done
[1:16:13] the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow
[1:16:15] you and the thing that's formed in you
[1:16:17] shall be called the son of the most
[1:16:20] high and then she just said be it unto
[1:16:23] me according to your word
[1:16:25] she yielded her life she yielded her
[1:16:27] body she yielded herself and the power
[1:16:29] of God under the anointing of the Holy
[1:16:31] Ghost took over and formed inside of her
[1:16:33] a life and she gave herself over to that
[1:16:35] life and that life began to take control
[1:16:37] of her life began to grow within her and
[1:16:41] began to demand certain Cravings certain
[1:16:43] foods it began to take up all of her
[1:16:45] territory amen amen begin to change the
[1:16:48] way she walks the way she talks the way
[1:16:50] she thinks amen everything began to
[1:16:52] change because of the life that was
[1:16:54] growing inside of her and she had no
[1:16:56] power to make it happen she had no power
[1:16:58] to reproduce it she had no power in
[1:17:00] herself all that she had was a seed Gene
[1:17:03] of faith that could say be it unto me
[1:17:06] that's the truth I accept it now be it
[1:17:07] unto me and when she stayed out of God's
[1:17:10] way but believed God's word and
[1:17:11] surrendered herself to it God came down
[1:17:13] by the Holy Ghost and did everything
[1:17:15] that needed to be done to reproduce a
[1:17:17] son on the Earth
[1:17:26] you know when she
[1:17:28] accepted the word to
[1:17:31] her when she accepted the word to
[1:17:34] her from that moment on brother B said
[1:17:37] she began to testify of what happened
[1:17:40] before she felt one thing so her faith
[1:17:43] wasn't based off her feelings or what
[1:17:46] she felt changed but it was faith based
[1:17:48] off the word of God solidly based off
[1:17:51] what an angel told her and she just
[1:17:53] accepted it
[1:17:55] all that would do us a world of good
[1:17:57] friends amen because we've accepted this
[1:17:59] message but so many times we start
[1:18:01] looking in the mirror looking at
[1:18:02] capabilities or or incapabilities or
[1:18:04] faults or failures and we start thinking
[1:18:06] Well it can't be me for this reason it
[1:18:07] can't be me for this reason and I don't
[1:18:09] really see any great changes in my life
[1:18:12] yet I still kind of have some of the old
[1:18:14] Cravings I had and I I still struggling
[1:18:16] with some of the thoughts I struggled
[1:18:17] with oh my goodness I wish I could get
[1:18:20] to that place where Mary was where I
[1:18:21] could run and say listen to what the
[1:18:23] angel said about me this I'm part of
[1:18:26] that word and it's going to be in me and
[1:18:28] I'm part of the end time plan and God's
[1:18:29] going to reproduce himself in me amen
[1:18:32] and no matter how many people look at us
[1:18:34] Crossways and said God's going to
[1:18:35] manifest self in you I know you I know
[1:18:37] what you're like I know what you're
[1:18:38] doing and I know what you said five
[1:18:40] minutes ago amen but none of that
[1:18:41] matters because he's not depending on me
[1:18:44] doing anything he's depending on me not
[1:18:47] doing
[1:18:48] anything he's depending on me getting
[1:18:50] out of his way he's depending on me just
[1:18:52] accepting and when when Elizabeth began
[1:18:55] to prophesy amen she she when when when
[1:18:58] when Mary goes to Elizabeth and begins
[1:19:00] to announce unto her what happened amen
[1:19:02] the life that was laying dead in the
[1:19:04] womb of Elizabeth sprung to life which
[1:19:06] was John the Baptist amen by the Holy
[1:19:08] Ghost amen at her salutation and then
[1:19:11] Elizabeth began to prophesy and her
[1:19:13] prophecy under her says all of these
[1:19:16] things will come to pass because you
[1:19:20] believed because not because you did
[1:19:23] anything but because you
[1:19:25] believed how is it that this bride is
[1:19:28] going to reproduce Jesus Christ on the
[1:19:30] earth not because you did anything not
[1:19:32] because you prayed harder fasted harder
[1:19:34] studied more no it's going to happen
[1:19:36] because you
[1:19:38] believed and surrendered to it and it
[1:19:41] doesn't matter for her the changes
[1:19:43] weren't immin immediate the changes
[1:19:45] weren't felt instantly amen but the
[1:19:47] faith that she had in that message told
[1:19:50] her that it was going to happen exactly
[1:19:52] the way he was going to he said it was
[1:19:53] going to happen amen and I friends I'm
[1:19:56] here to declare that that I believe with
[1:19:59] all my heart that Jesus Christ wants to
[1:20:02] reproduce himself on the earth and
[1:20:04] manifest himself through you and I amen
[1:20:07] and I I there's not a thing in this
[1:20:10] world I can do to make it
[1:20:12] happen and of all of our attempts to
[1:20:14] make it happen have been
[1:20:16] disastrous that's right what I need to
[1:20:19] do is have confidence in the message he
[1:20:21] gave
[1:20:22] me to believe that message of the angel
[1:20:25] the angel that he sent in this end time
[1:20:27] that angel of the Lord came in this day
[1:20:29] the seventh angel Amen to call out a
[1:20:32] bride to tell her you're the bride
[1:20:34] you're the one Now's the Time the
[1:20:37] prophecies to be fulfilled at you and
[1:20:39] all that he needs from us is somebody
[1:20:42] that can say I believe
[1:20:45] it and I surrendered to it that's
[1:20:50] it listen we don't know there's a lot we
[1:20:53] don't know you know I told you before I
[1:20:55] have a pile of
[1:20:57] questions I don't know if I go to the
[1:20:59] Millennium with the same kind of mind I
[1:21:01] have now which probably won't happen but
[1:21:03] if I do I'm just going to go around
[1:21:04] asking people questions all the time
[1:21:07] Moses when you did this what were you
[1:21:11] thinking we don't know if she had
[1:21:13] morning
[1:21:14] sickness we don't know if she threw up
[1:21:17] we don't know if she felt great we don't
[1:21:20] know if she had odd
[1:21:21] Cravings we don't know if it became
[1:21:24] difficult for Joseph def find what she
[1:21:25] wanted to eat that
[1:21:28] day I mean didn't brother Brenham showed
[1:21:31] us that Elijah was a man of like
[1:21:33] passions as we that life is life and
[1:21:35] normal is
[1:21:39] normal we don't know what persecution
[1:21:41] she
[1:21:42] got brother R told us she was she was
[1:21:45] mocked and persecuted and accused of
[1:21:47] having a relationship with a Roman
[1:21:49] soldier yeah
[1:21:51] right you know it wasn't easy it wasn't
[1:21:53] meet an name Ang believ the message run
[1:21:57] off and everything was great yeah we
[1:22:01] don't know what family members rejected
[1:22:04] her we don't know how she felt we don't
[1:22:07] know if she became uncomfortable we
[1:22:09] don't know if the last few weeks of her
[1:22:11] pregnancy she could barely
[1:22:13] breathe we don't know if she had to lay
[1:22:16] in a certain position
[1:22:19] or we don't know what it was like we
[1:22:21] don't know the whisperings that went on
[1:22:24] behind her back when she walked to the
[1:22:26] market we don't know whether she was
[1:22:30] sick or not we don't know any of
[1:22:32] that but we can only imagine we know she
[1:22:36] suffered
[1:22:38] persecution but the only thing that
[1:22:40] could get her through the difficult
[1:22:42] times was the Angel's message and the
[1:22:45] life inside of her she knew it it may
[1:22:50] not have been always easy it may not
[1:22:51] have been convenient it doesn't mean
[1:22:53] there was no trials it doesn't doesn't
[1:22:54] mean there wasn't hardship attached to
[1:22:56] it doesn't mean there wasn't difficulty
[1:22:58] but she had two things she had the
[1:23:00] Angel's message and she had the life
[1:23:01] inside of her amen friends can we walk
[1:23:05] with confidence through difficult times
[1:23:06] because of the Angel's message and the
[1:23:08] life inside of us the life that's
[1:23:10] growing in us and taking over our life
[1:23:13] can we can we just hang on to the
[1:23:15] Angel's message and knowing what
[1:23:17] happened inside of us and face down
[1:23:20] whatever persecution or difficulty or
[1:23:22] hard circumstances that come along
[1:23:24] because we know what we heard and we
[1:23:26] know it was true and we know what
[1:23:28] resonated inside and we know what's
[1:23:29] growing inside of
[1:23:32] us and then have confidence in
[1:23:37] it brother bam goes on and he begins to
[1:23:40] say begins to write and pick up your pen
[1:23:43] and write many things but he comes down
[1:23:46] to the
[1:23:48] end he says those in the bride do only
[1:23:51] his will no one can make them do
[1:23:54] otherwise
[1:23:55] they have thus sayith the Lord or they
[1:23:56] keep still they know that it has to be
[1:23:59] God in them doing the works fulfilling
[1:24:03] his own word he did not complete all his
[1:24:05] work while in his Earthly Ministry so
[1:24:07] now he works in and through the bride
[1:24:11] where is he's going to do his work
[1:24:12] through US how's he going to do it not
[1:24:16] by our strength and not by our effort or
[1:24:19] intelligence he's going to complete this
[1:24:21] work himself
[1:24:26] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:24:28] for him to do certain things that he
[1:24:29] must now do but he would now fulfill
[1:24:32] through the bride that work which he
[1:24:33] left for this specific
[1:24:37] time so now there's a work that needs to
[1:24:40] be accomplished in this hour that we
[1:24:42] live in
[1:24:43] but I want to say like this it's not our
[1:24:48] work it's his
[1:24:50] work but he's going to do his work in
[1:24:53] his bride body which we're a part of so
[1:24:56] are we a part of that work yes but I'm
[1:24:58] not the one working he's the one working
[1:25:02] I'm just the one
[1:25:05] yielding and sir we would see Jesus
[1:25:08] brother says well that's the same thing
[1:25:10] the great Holy Spirit Messiah the
[1:25:13] anointing comes upon us today and it
[1:25:15] produces exactly his life just the same
[1:25:18] as Beethoven would produce Beethoven
[1:25:21] again if the life of Beethoven lived in
[1:25:22] me why why I could compose songs if the
[1:25:26] life of John Diller lived in me I would
[1:25:28] be a criminal if the life of some other
[1:25:30] person whatever it was that would be in
[1:25:31] me in my life and if the life of Jesus
[1:25:34] Christ is in you that's just what you'll
[1:25:37] be see that's exactly you'll do his
[1:25:39] Works Jesus said
[1:25:41] so so what do I need to accomplish this
[1:25:44] work I need his life in me amen I I just
[1:25:47] need his life in
[1:25:49] me he says in they identify Christ of
[1:25:52] all ages that so he gets the eternal
[1:25:55] spirit his attribute displayed in that
[1:25:57] body then like any picture in its
[1:25:59] negative form it goes into the dark room
[1:26:02] there it's developed it comes out to the
[1:26:04] perfect picture and we go in the dark
[1:26:06] room but to come out after the negative
[1:26:08] has been perfect a perfect picture in
[1:26:10] the image of Christ we go into the dark
[1:26:12] grave into the dark room for developing
[1:26:14] it takes death to develop it and so he's
[1:26:16] showing us that there's going to this
[1:26:19] this Earthly vessel is a negative form
[1:26:22] of what God had in his mind but death
[1:26:25] will bring us at some point Amen to the
[1:26:27] perfect picture of what he had and the
[1:26:30] the Dark Room of death brings
[1:26:32] development now I know I'm dealing with
[1:26:35] some of you who have never seen negative
[1:26:37] film
[1:26:38] before I don't even know how to explain
[1:26:40] this
[1:26:42] friends long long
[1:26:45] ago we used to take pictures and there
[1:26:49] was actual film there was nothing
[1:26:50] digital and when you open the shutter
[1:26:53] certain light came in and Light impacted
[1:26:55] a chemical on a on a film and it and it
[1:26:57] left an imprint or a picture but that
[1:27:00] picture was in negative form so there's
[1:27:02] a positive picture that's taken from
[1:27:04] there's a real image then you get a
[1:27:05] negative picture then you go through the
[1:27:07] dark room and you you you lay this in
[1:27:09] trays of chemicals and it begins to
[1:27:10] develop and all of a sudden you can see
[1:27:12] the image and you get a reflection of
[1:27:15] that image so the original image is in
[1:27:18] the mind of God but then he's going to
[1:27:20] give us a body that's a perfect
[1:27:22] reflection of that image but doing so he
[1:27:24] brings us here in this body which is
[1:27:26] negative form and we go through the dark
[1:27:28] room process amen till we come into the
[1:27:31] development and we come into the picture
[1:27:32] of what was in his mind the mind is the
[1:27:34] real yeah amen the picture is the
[1:27:36] reflection yeah so brother bam tells us
[1:27:39] that's going to happen to us but then he
[1:27:41] brings it down to today and he doesn't
[1:27:43] just leave it as something that's going
[1:27:44] to happen that's for this outside body
[1:27:46] but now he says just like it takes death
[1:27:49] to yourself to develop the picture of
[1:27:52] the image of Christ The Life of Christ
[1:27:55] in you amen you have to dump your own
[1:27:58] out so that Christ can come in you have
[1:28:00] to die to
[1:28:03] yourself just like death will eventually
[1:28:05] bring us to a new body which is the the
[1:28:08] the the the developed
[1:28:10] picture but now to develop the picture
[1:28:13] that God had in his mind of us being a
[1:28:15] many-membered body of Jesus Christ
[1:28:17] reflecting the very life of Jesus Christ
[1:28:19] to this world in order for us to do that
[1:28:22] we have to go through a dark room
[1:28:23] process process in this life and that
[1:28:25] dark room process is death to
[1:28:29] ourselves to where we can lay our life
[1:28:32] down so that he can have
[1:28:35] preeminence and then when we die to
[1:28:38] ourselves then he can through the
[1:28:41] process of our
[1:28:44] death he can bring out the
[1:28:48] picture and what is the picture supposed
[1:28:50] to
[1:28:51] be Jesus Christ
[1:28:54] Jesus Christ only now instead of the the
[1:28:59] One Singular vessel 2,000 years ago now
[1:29:01] it's in a many-membered body but it's
[1:29:03] the picture of Jesus Christ that's
[1:29:05] what's supposed to be
[1:29:07] developed he goes on in the same quote
[1:29:09] he says so does your physical being die
[1:29:12] to be formed and molded into the image
[1:29:14] of him but there is still that attribute
[1:29:16] that cannot be destroyed it can never be
[1:29:18] destroyed it's God in the beginning it's
[1:29:21] God above us God With Us God in us and
[1:29:24] it's all the attributes of God eternal
[1:29:26] life to the sons of
[1:29:29] men God wants to develop the
[1:29:33] picture but in order for to develop it
[1:29:35] we've got to go through the dark room
[1:29:38] process of death and
[1:29:40] surrender I know that's what all of us
[1:29:42] want because we keep coming back we keep
[1:29:44] coming back to hear
[1:29:46] more but there's areas in our life that
[1:29:49] will die and then we realize something's
[1:29:51] still alive and that needs it's a
[1:29:53] process of this dark room God's taking
[1:29:55] us to so that we can become a clearer
[1:29:57] and clearer reflection as we go through
[1:30:00] the dark room process now listen I've
[1:30:02] never I've been in a dark room once and
[1:30:03] it was a field trip when I was a
[1:30:06] kid and so I don't really know how it
[1:30:08] works that's what I'm I'm just prefacing
[1:30:10] I'm no expert but as you go through the
[1:30:13] process more of the image comes out in
[1:30:15] each tray there's several
[1:30:17] trays and through this process of life
[1:30:21] we should be looking more like Christ
[1:30:23] and more like Christ and more like
[1:30:27] Christ we may be in first tray we may be
[1:30:30] in second tray I don't know how many
[1:30:31] trays there
[1:30:32] are and we can get discouraged about the
[1:30:35] tray we're in But realize friends we're
[1:30:38] in the process
[1:30:40] amen even even Mary reproducing Christ a
[1:30:45] body for God to dwell in was a process
[1:30:47] of 10 months yeah this us amen
[1:30:51] reproducing Christ is a process and I
[1:30:54] don't know how long the process will
[1:30:55] take but listen we have to believe we're
[1:30:57] in the process we've got to stop
[1:31:00] thinking I'm not in the process I don't
[1:31:02] know if I'm in the process maybe I'm in
[1:31:03] the process I'm not in the process I
[1:31:05] used to be in the process now I'm not in
[1:31:07] the process that kind of thinking is
[1:31:09] never going to produce anything there's
[1:31:11] got to be something that strikes our
[1:31:12] heart and puts a stake down and says I'm
[1:31:15] not going to let the devil take away
[1:31:16] what the angel told me and what happened
[1:31:19] inside of me I may not be to the end of
[1:31:21] the process and the image you got now
[1:31:23] might just be a little awkward looking
[1:31:25] outline of something I can kind of tell
[1:31:27] I I'm not as I'm not what I used to be
[1:31:30] I'm not what I ought to be amen but I'm
[1:31:32] right here I'm not happy with what I am
[1:31:34] because I know what the picture should
[1:31:36] be I'm not happy with this stage but
[1:31:38] friends let's get excited that we're in
[1:31:40] the process that we're in the dark room
[1:31:43] that there's something happening to us
[1:31:45] that's bigger than us it's beyond us
[1:31:47] it's his work amen and listen it's never
[1:31:50] the picture that's doing anything to
[1:31:51] itself it's always it's always the
[1:31:54] artist that's behind it that is taking
[1:31:56] it through the developing process you're
[1:31:58] not dipping yourself in a tray you
[1:32:01] didn't take the picture you didn't come
[1:32:02] up with the image you didn't have a
[1:32:04] desire to reproduce on the earth that
[1:32:06] was not you that was him and he's the
[1:32:08] one moving you from tray to
[1:32:13] tray
[1:32:16] amen I I want to be
[1:32:19] thankful that I'm in the dark room I
[1:32:23] want to be thankful I heard the Angel's
[1:32:24] message I want to be thankful there was
[1:32:26] something in me that said it's
[1:32:28] truth I just want to be thankful and
[1:32:31] believe that that is
[1:32:34] enough that that is enough that's all I
[1:32:37] need because if that life came in me
[1:32:39] then that life in me will do the same
[1:32:41] thing the Holy Ghost did in Mary and It
[1:32:43] produced amen the Son of God again and
[1:32:46] it come through the process and manifest
[1:32:48] upon the
[1:32:50] Earth and I believe that this Angel's
[1:32:52] message coming to him elect
[1:32:54] predestinated seed who has something
[1:32:56] inside of them that say be it unto me
[1:32:58] according to your word amen is just as
[1:33:00] much in the same place as the Virgin was
[1:33:02] with the same promise for
[1:33:05] us and we got to just rest friends the
[1:33:08] whole Christian walk is based on rest
[1:33:10] and brother B said I know a Christian's
[1:33:12] always tore up wanting to know that he's
[1:33:13] in the will of God absolutely we want to
[1:33:16] make sure that we're doing what God
[1:33:17] wants we're lined up to the word but
[1:33:19] when it comes to whether or not I can
[1:33:21] reproduce anything let's just rest
[1:33:23] because the truth is I can't reproduce
[1:33:25] anything amen I'm wrestling with my
[1:33:29] surrender not wrestling with my Works
[1:33:32] amen I hope that makes sense amen I'm
[1:33:35] not wrestling to produce something I'm
[1:33:38] wrestling to get this flesh out of his
[1:33:40] way so he can produce
[1:33:41] something I'm wrestling this mind and
[1:33:44] this these lust and these desires and
[1:33:46] these thoughts I'm wrestling them into
[1:33:49] subjection to the word so that they can
[1:33:51] stay dead and out of the way amen so
[1:33:53] that he can do what he wants to
[1:33:56] do praise God am he says in the and
[1:34:02] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:34:03] this quotes become so precious to me he
[1:34:06] said it's not expressions in some church
[1:34:08] that we should Express something it's a
[1:34:11] life that you don't live
[1:34:14] yourself but he comes in you and lives
[1:34:17] by
[1:34:17] himself and you become a prisoner to any
[1:34:20] human intellectual being at all you're
[1:34:22] led by the SP spirit and how do you know
[1:34:26] praise be to God it's I want to read
[1:34:28] that
[1:34:29] again it's a life that you don't live
[1:34:34] yourself praise
[1:34:36] God it's a life that you don't live
[1:34:39] yourself remember brother bom said if I
[1:34:41] had the life of Beethoven in me I would
[1:34:43] write music well if you had the life of
[1:34:46] Beethoven in you you wouldn't strain to
[1:34:48] write music you would just write
[1:34:51] music you wouldn't have to put forth
[1:34:54] effort or strength you wouldn't have to
[1:34:57] you you understand amen and he also said
[1:35:00] that the life of John dilig was in you'd
[1:35:02] be a criminal and you wouldn't have to
[1:35:03] put any effort towards it I mean how to
[1:35:06] rob a bank or how to rob a train would
[1:35:07] just drop in your mind you would get the
[1:35:10] inspiration CU it's not your life it's
[1:35:12] another life amen this isn't a life that
[1:35:15] we live
[1:35:17] ourselves Eve was never intended to
[1:35:20] reproduce her own life yeah amen she was
[1:35:23] intended to reproduce her husband's life
[1:35:25] yeah she was there to receive his life
[1:35:28] and yield herself so that his life could
[1:35:30] come through her vessel to reproduce
[1:35:32] himself on the earth amen we're not here
[1:35:35] to live our own life we're not here to
[1:35:38] try to live the life of
[1:35:41] Christ I hope that doesn't stumble you
[1:35:45] but you're not here to try to live the
[1:35:46] life of Christ because if you try then
[1:35:48] you're a human being tried in living a
[1:35:50] supernatural
[1:35:52] life because it's not a life that you
[1:35:55] live yourself it's a life he comes in in
[1:35:58] life he lives
[1:36:00] himself that's the only thing that'll
[1:36:03] work if we try it won't work because we
[1:36:07] can't do it but if we just believe and
[1:36:11] surrender then if that life is in us it
[1:36:14] will do it amen and I know how
[1:36:17] discouraging it is to live a human life
[1:36:20] I know how discouraging it is to still
[1:36:21] have a cck bur nature I know how
[1:36:23] discouraging it to still realize there's
[1:36:24] a black
[1:36:25] dog super discouraging but don't let the
[1:36:28] discouragement of being in a perverted
[1:36:30] form and living in a natural life don't
[1:36:32] let that Rob the truth out of our hearts
[1:36:34] because if it does we lose all hope we
[1:36:37] lose all faith we lose our rest yeah
[1:36:41] amen
[1:36:44] amen in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 let's
[1:36:47] turn here together I just referenced
[1:36:49] this but I would like to read it
[1:36:51] together 2 Corinthians
[1:36:54] chapter 10
[1:37:06] yeah 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse
[1:37:13] three says for though we walk in the
[1:37:15] flesh we do not war after the flesh for
[1:37:19] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:37:20] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:37:22] pulling down of
[1:37:24] strongholds casting down imaginations in
[1:37:27] every High thing that exalted itself
[1:37:29] against the knowledge of God and
[1:37:31] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:37:34] The Obedience of
[1:37:35] Christ what is this friends this is our
[1:37:37] wrestling
[1:37:39] match this is where we wrestle with our
[1:37:42] surrender to bring every thought says
[1:37:46] every I I'll read this
[1:37:49] again
[1:37:50] uh casting down imagin ations and every
[1:37:55] High thing that exalted itself against
[1:37:57] the knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:37:59] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:38:01] of
[1:38:03] Christ Our wrestling is to not allow the
[1:38:07] whisperings of the enemy in our own
[1:38:10] nature to take the leadership yeah amen
[1:38:14] but to let the word always have
[1:38:16] leadership Amen to let the headship of
[1:38:19] Christ the anointed word always be in
[1:38:21] leadership and know other thoughts so
[1:38:24] now we must capture every thought that
[1:38:27] comes into our mind and bring it captive
[1:38:29] arrest it and bring it obedience to
[1:38:31] Christ which Christ is the anointed
[1:38:34] word and so now what are we here to do
[1:38:37] we're here because the greatest battle
[1:38:38] ever fought is fought where in the mind
[1:38:42] and we're here to take these these
[1:38:44] thoughts Amen brother B said he can't he
[1:38:46] can't read your thoughts but he can put
[1:38:48] thoughts in your mind the enemy right
[1:38:50] amen and we're here to to take all these
[1:38:53] imaginations and cast them down anything
[1:38:56] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:38:57] of
[1:38:58] God even the wrong ideas the devil gives
[1:39:02] you about yourself you've got to cast it
[1:39:04] down because what the word says is
[1:39:05] what's true
[1:39:07] amen because when we start to entertain
[1:39:10] negative thoughts about oursel that's
[1:39:11] contrary to the word amen L we're going
[1:39:13] to wind up defeated all over again
[1:39:16] because it's not the word that vain
[1:39:18] imagination is contrary to the knowledge
[1:39:20] of God and it must be cast down amen
[1:39:23] amen because if we receive the Angel's
[1:39:26] message and we receive the life in us
[1:39:28] then the things the devil's telling us
[1:39:29] about ourselves is not the truth
[1:39:33] amen and then every other thought we
[1:39:36] bring it captive in obedience to the
[1:39:38] word of God so that the word of God has
[1:39:41] what preeminence what is it he's looking
[1:39:43] for in the second fold of the threefold
[1:39:45] purpose preeminence how is he going to
[1:39:47] get preeminence when his word has
[1:39:48] preeminence what's the headship the
[1:39:50] headship is the word which is Christ is
[1:39:52] going to have preeminence in the body
[1:39:54] amen as we as we capture all of these
[1:39:58] thoughts and bring him subject to the
[1:39:59] word if Eve would have done that in the
[1:40:01] beginning there wouldn't have been a
[1:40:02] fall amen if she would have just took
[1:40:05] the thoughts that the the devil was
[1:40:07] putting in her mind and lined it up with
[1:40:09] the word amen she would and and how was
[1:40:11] he deceiving her he was deceiving her by
[1:40:13] the
[1:40:14] word multiply and replenish and started
[1:40:17] telling her well this is how you have to
[1:40:18] do it and this is how you do it the
[1:40:19] problem is listen here's the deal God
[1:40:22] had never never yet told her how to do
[1:40:24] it he only said that you will do it amen
[1:40:27] and now she was supposing maybe we're
[1:40:29] going to figure it out on our own yeah
[1:40:32] yeah amen what was her job her job was
[1:40:34] to believe the word to believe the
[1:40:35] promise and wait for God to give further
[1:40:38] instructions yeah amen amen Hey listen
[1:40:41] we've got Bridges to cross we've got
[1:40:43] things to manifest there's things that
[1:40:45] the prophet said was going to happen in
[1:40:47] the end time and and I don't I I don't
[1:40:49] even presume to understand what they are
[1:40:51] be able to lay them out I just know
[1:40:52] things that said statements that he made
[1:40:54] and the question is how are we going to
[1:40:56] produce that and how are we going to
[1:40:57] produce this I have no idea my job is
[1:41:00] not to produce anything my job is to
[1:41:02] believe that it will happen exactly the
[1:41:04] way the prophet said happen and wait for
[1:41:06] further instructions amen cuz if Eve
[1:41:08] would have waited for further
[1:41:09] instructions she would have brought
[1:41:11] forth Christ brother renam said
[1:41:14] amen so we don't have to feel insecure
[1:41:17] that I have to have all the answers Eve
[1:41:19] didn't need all the
[1:41:20] answers that's an insecurity in ity that
[1:41:23] we have to figure everything out and
[1:41:25] when somebody says well what did Brother
[1:41:26] BR mean by this and all of a sudden we
[1:41:28] have to come up with an answer that
[1:41:29] sounds good listen sometimes it's better
[1:41:31] to say I don't know what he meant I
[1:41:33] don't know how it'll happen but I
[1:41:34] believe it and I'm waiting for further
[1:41:36] instructions I'm waiting for a
[1:41:37] revelation from God I can't inject my
[1:41:40] own
[1:41:41] thinking and make it
[1:41:45] happen brother B said and it is the
[1:41:48] message it is the rising of the
[1:41:51] Sun so no wonder he said fear not for
[1:41:53] now notice we are Redeemed by him and
[1:41:55] now risen with him that's what Easter
[1:41:57] means to the people risen with him
[1:41:59] notice now we have his spirit in us the
[1:42:02] abstract deed fully paid no you don't
[1:42:05] say well I hope I make it you've already
[1:42:08] made it
[1:42:11] amen you know how foolish it would have
[1:42:13] been for Eve to say or for Mary to say I
[1:42:16] hope I deliver this
[1:42:21] baby do you know what I mean
[1:42:24] I hope that it's a healthy baby I hope
[1:42:27] that I have a full pregnancy I hope that
[1:42:30] there's no complications I hope that the
[1:42:32] baby's born and
[1:42:35] alive do you
[1:42:38] understand do you know no matter what
[1:42:41] thought entered her
[1:42:42] mind she should never entertained any of
[1:42:45] those because she already had a
[1:42:48] promise you're Pro a promise that
[1:42:51] there's going to be a life that comes
[1:42:52] that's a which is God With Us amen for
[1:42:55] her to doubt that no matter how logical
[1:42:58] it is yeah no matter how logical that
[1:43:01] thought would be maybe she didn't feel
[1:43:03] the baby move for two days and the devil
[1:43:05] began to whisper in her mind no matter
[1:43:07] how logical the thought would be amen
[1:43:09] she's to cast down all reasoning how
[1:43:11] foolish it would believe that God would
[1:43:14] send a messenger to tell her who she is
[1:43:16] to bring a life inside of her to begin
[1:43:18] to Quicken a life and bring a life
[1:43:19] inside of her just to wonder and worry
[1:43:22] if he was going to be able ble to bring
[1:43:23] a birth and bring a life and fulfill the
[1:43:26] promise but that's exactly what happens
[1:43:29] to you and I am me we've got to go back
[1:43:31] to the original Faith amen that original
[1:43:34] thing that sparked inside of us and say
[1:43:36] I don't know how I don't know when amen
[1:43:39] but everything he promised to me is
[1:43:41] going to be manifest and everything he's
[1:43:42] promised to do he's going to do and then
[1:43:45] when he needs to use me to do the
[1:43:47] supernatural he's going to do the
[1:43:48] supernatural
[1:43:53] praise
[1:43:56] God you
[1:43:59] don't I'll read that again you don't say
[1:44:01] I hope I'll make it you've already made
[1:44:07] it and then listen next statement not I
[1:44:11] will make it I've already made
[1:44:17] it amen listen to the next
[1:44:21] statement I never made it he made it for
[1:44:27] me the works were finished before the
[1:44:30] foundation of the
[1:44:31] world everything that he wants to do
[1:44:33] through your body of Flesh was finished
[1:44:35] before the foundation of the
[1:44:39] world what does he need us to do maybe
[1:44:42] to not worry about
[1:44:44] it maybe to not stress about it but
[1:44:48] maybe just to believe Amen to rest
[1:44:51] brother the whole Christian Life is
[1:44:53] based on
[1:44:54] rest do I struggle yes but I don't
[1:44:57] struggle whether or not I'm one of them
[1:44:59] I don't struggle whether or not he's
[1:45:00] going to produce his word I struggle on
[1:45:02] all these thoughts going through my mind
[1:45:04] and all these Desires in my flesh that's
[1:45:06] where my wrestling match is yeah amen
[1:45:09] but whether or not I'm one of them I
[1:45:10] settled that long ago whether or not
[1:45:12] he's going to produce what he promised
[1:45:13] to produce he promised it he'll produce
[1:45:15] it that I'm not struggling
[1:45:19] with he made it for me not me him well
[1:45:22] brother said I don't care what they say
[1:45:24] here he made it for me that's all I want
[1:45:27] that's all I'm caring about I just want
[1:45:29] to I just want to see him
[1:45:33] manifested how can you do it call him
[1:45:35] down no he's in you amen see he he's in
[1:45:41] you well then Lord if I can get myself
[1:45:44] out of the way you can manifest see how
[1:45:47] can you do it because you ordained it so
[1:45:49] all that the father has given me will
[1:45:51] come Glory
[1:45:54] Amen in in the book of Zechariah there
[1:45:58] was prophecy to zerubabel and it says he
[1:46:00] says this not by might nor by power but
[1:46:05] by my S Spirit sayeth the
[1:46:09] Lord What Spirit have we received What
[1:46:13] Spirit has come on this message what
[1:46:15] what has God returned to us he's
[1:46:16] returned his very life to
[1:46:18] us and if the life of Beethoven's in you
[1:46:21] what are you going to do compose
[1:46:24] songs now hey the life of Beethoven may
[1:46:27] come into you and it may it may take you
[1:46:29] a little while to get into the Rhythm
[1:46:31] you may still be trying with your own
[1:46:33] life to write a song and it's going to
[1:46:34] be pretty messy when you can finally
[1:46:37] figure out what's going on and get out
[1:46:39] of the way and let what's inside just
[1:46:40] flow you'll write a nice
[1:46:44] song it's taking us a long time to
[1:46:47] figure out what's going
[1:46:49] on Amen it's taken us a long time just
[1:46:52] to
[1:46:53] realize he's not asking me to do
[1:46:56] anything he's asking me to
[1:46:59] surrender he's asking me to yield he's
[1:47:02] asking me to
[1:47:04] believe when it says when the son of man
[1:47:07] cometh will he find good works on the
[1:47:12] earth when a son of man cometh will he
[1:47:14] find a church in perfect
[1:47:16] order that wasn't the question when the
[1:47:19] son of man cometh will he find Faith
[1:47:22] amen
[1:47:23] all he needs to move his program forward
[1:47:25] is somebody that believes his word and
[1:47:28] will surrender themselves to his
[1:47:31] life so that the Life of Christ can come
[1:47:35] through Romans 8:11 says but if the
[1:47:38] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:47:40] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:47:42] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:47:44] your mortal bodies by a spirit that
[1:47:47] dwelleth in you if you look at the
[1:47:49] context of that scripture and the way
[1:47:50] brother brandham used it is not just
[1:47:51] speaking of quickening after death are
[1:47:54] quickening in the Rapture he's actually
[1:47:56] talking of making this body live that
[1:47:59] word he will Quicken these mortal bodies
[1:48:02] who will do it when you try a little
[1:48:03] harder
[1:48:05] brother when you just knock it off and
[1:48:07] try a little harder and quit fooling
[1:48:09] around
[1:48:11] no if the same spirit that raised him
[1:48:14] from the dead dwell on you it'll Quicken
[1:48:16] this body to the word amen not my life
[1:48:19] his life it's not a life I live myself
[1:48:22] it's a life he comes in and lives his
[1:48:25] son what does he need he just needs room
[1:48:28] to
[1:48:29] work just needs room to work
[1:48:33] friends brother B made the statement he
[1:48:35] said I don't remember what message I was
[1:48:37] just reading it he
[1:48:39] said God can only use what portion you
[1:48:42] surrender to him right he was in
[1:48:45] reference to Samson he said Samson gave
[1:48:47] his strength to God but he gave his
[1:48:48] heart to the Lila and God could use his
[1:48:52] strength
[1:48:53] but what God wanted was his heart he
[1:48:56] wanted all of
[1:48:57] Samson God will use God's a gentleman he
[1:49:00] doesn't take God Only Takes what's
[1:49:03] surrendered and God can use anything
[1:49:05] that you surrender to him so I say oh
[1:49:08] God help us to surrender everything to
[1:49:11] him
[1:49:13] Amen brother B says this is a dying
[1:49:16] spirit and a dying body now you can't be
[1:49:19] in two bodies at one time but there can
[1:49:20] be two Natures in you at one time now
[1:49:23] the nature of the spirit of the Lord
[1:49:24] when you're born again you're not born a
[1:49:25] physical like the baby was but what's
[1:49:27] happened is the spiritual Birth has come
[1:49:30] to
[1:49:32] you he brother B says that there can be
[1:49:35] two Natures you still have your own
[1:49:37] nature but you have the nature of God
[1:49:38] because you've been born again by the
[1:49:40] spirit of
[1:49:41] God and he told us we' we've read this
[1:49:44] before but the white dog and black dog
[1:49:45] it depends on which one you cater to
[1:49:48] which one has
[1:49:49] strength and I want him to have room to
[1:49:53] work inside of me so I want the other
[1:49:56] one to stay dead and stay surrendered I
[1:50:00] want it to be his life in
[1:50:03] me in the patas vision from the church
[1:50:06] age book prophet of God makes this
[1:50:08] statement he says have you ever noticed
[1:50:09] how the world gets into the spirit of
[1:50:11] things that are in the
[1:50:12] world he's going to begin to talk about
[1:50:15] ball games and all that and he's going
[1:50:16] to talk about getting in the
[1:50:19] spirit but but before that you if we
[1:50:23] just think
[1:50:24] about like he said you you can't be in
[1:50:27] two bodies at once but there can be two
[1:50:28] Natures in you at
[1:50:30] once if you think about your own
[1:50:32] physical body you have a body and that
[1:50:35] body is there to manifest the life
[1:50:37] inside of you and there's a life living
[1:50:38] inside that's animating the body you're
[1:50:40] moving according to the life that's on
[1:50:42] the inside the spirit that's on the
[1:50:43] inside but there are sometimes other
[1:50:46] lives come into our
[1:50:48] body have you ever experienced that has
[1:50:50] anybody had the flu
[1:50:53] another life came into your body yeah
[1:50:55] and began to manifest
[1:50:57] itself and certain parts of your body
[1:51:00] you lost control
[1:51:01] of did things you didn't want to
[1:51:05] do amen I won't be any more descriptive
[1:51:08] than
[1:51:10] that why because another life was using
[1:51:13] your body for expression yeah another
[1:51:17] life needed a body to manifest itself
[1:51:20] whether it was germ life or it was
[1:51:22] cancer and a cancer begin to grow and
[1:51:23] begin to rob from your life and your
[1:51:25] bloodstream and it begin to affect you
[1:51:27] and you get weak and you start to lose
[1:51:29] control of certain parts of your body
[1:51:31] what did that it was another life using
[1:51:33] your body for
[1:51:36] manifestation so to me what is the
[1:51:38] battle over the battle in me is over
[1:51:41] expression which life is going to be
[1:51:44] expressed cuz there's a war there's a
[1:51:46] battle over expression God created man
[1:51:48] in his own image because he wanted to be
[1:51:50] a reflection on the earth of God he he
[1:51:53] was in his image he was going to reflect
[1:51:54] God but what was Satan try to do Satan
[1:51:57] tried to find a way to inject himself
[1:51:59] into the same vessels amen so that he
[1:52:01] could express his life from the very day
[1:52:05] one from the very beginning the battle
[1:52:08] has been over which life is going to be
[1:52:10] expressed in these Tabernacles amen amen
[1:52:13] so we understand this that another
[1:52:15] Spirit can come and that spirit will
[1:52:17] manifest its own life whether it's flu
[1:52:20] whether it's pneumonia amen whether it's
[1:52:21] cancer whatever it is that Spirit or
[1:52:24] even demon possession it would begin to
[1:52:26] manifest itself amen so there can be
[1:52:28] another life come in to manifest itself
[1:52:31] yeah well the body of Christ amen
[1:52:34] doesn't need any other life manifesting
[1:52:36] itself what it needs is just the Life of
[1:52:39] Christ
[1:52:40] manifesting so everything else has to go
[1:52:43] we only want one life I don't want my
[1:52:47] personal life manifesting I want his
[1:52:49] life
[1:52:50] manifesting and what's the battle over
[1:52:53] expression there's life there's Spirits
[1:52:56] friends there's Spirits all around that
[1:52:58] want to be expressed and the spirits
[1:53:00] will come and influence your human
[1:53:02] spirit and your own nature and what is
[1:53:04] that spirit that Spirit needs to have a
[1:53:06] vessel for expression remember when God
[1:53:09] came to Legion amen uh at the Sea of
[1:53:12] ganar and and there was a legion of
[1:53:15] demons for their many and he cast them
[1:53:17] out and he said don't send us to the
[1:53:18] abyss but send us into the swine why
[1:53:20] those Spirits needed a body to manifest
[1:53:23] themselves and all the spirits that are
[1:53:25] around us not just sickness but lust
[1:53:27] Spirits demon spirits of every kind what
[1:53:29] does it need it needs a body to express
[1:53:31] its life through and it's trying to take
[1:53:34] the same place that Christ has taken cuz
[1:53:37] that's what happened in the Garden of
[1:53:40] Eden and I don't want this vessel to
[1:53:44] manifest another life another Spirit
[1:53:49] anything but the spirit of my bridegroom
[1:53:51] amen
[1:53:53] amen have I failed I failed
[1:53:56] friends I I've I've been seduced by
[1:54:00] Spirits I thought they were right I've
[1:54:02] done things I shouldn't have done and
[1:54:03] I'm regret and I'm embarrassed of but
[1:54:06] I'm still casting down every
[1:54:08] reasoning every thought every thought
[1:54:11] that exalted itself against the
[1:54:12] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:54:14] captivity every thought into The
[1:54:16] Obedience of Christ I may have failed
[1:54:18] yesterday but that doesn't mean I've got
[1:54:20] to fail tomorrow
[1:54:22] mean I'm not moving from one trade to
[1:54:24] the next cuz he's going to develop this
[1:54:26] picture amen praise be to
[1:54:29] God so because of that
[1:54:32] concept we've got to be wary of what
[1:54:35] Spirits we allow to use this vessel yeah
[1:54:39] because remember this is the only place
[1:54:41] Christ is going to be manifest on this
[1:54:43] Earth in his predestinated vessels so
[1:54:46] where is it the devil wants
[1:54:49] manifestation same spot
[1:54:53] and then brother man begins to tell us
[1:54:55] about being in the
[1:54:57] spirit because I want that Spirit to
[1:55:00] fully possess
[1:55:02] me he says have you ever noticed how the
[1:55:04] world gets into the spirit of things
[1:55:05] that are in the world they go to their
[1:55:07] ball games they sporting events and
[1:55:09] their dances they enter into the spirit
[1:55:10] of it they don't sit there like a
[1:55:12] Wallflower old dried up sticks they
[1:55:14] enter right into the feeling of things
[1:55:16] and become a part of things but oh how
[1:55:19] they hate the Christians for getting
[1:55:20] into the spirit of God's word they call
[1:55:23] us Fanatics and holy rollers there's
[1:55:24] nothing they won't do to show their
[1:55:26] hatred and disapproval but ignore that
[1:55:29] you can expect it knowing where it come
[1:55:31] from just go on and get in the spirit of
[1:55:34] worship remember starts to tell us and
[1:55:36] he has different places that he
[1:55:37] describes this but he says you know how
[1:55:39] they go to a ball game and and the ball
[1:55:41] game is no fun unless you get in the
[1:55:43] spirit of the game you can be the guy
[1:55:46] sitting there trying to read a newspaper
[1:55:48] and then you know everybody else and
[1:55:49] they look at you like you're the odd
[1:55:51] duck and what's wrong with you this is
[1:55:53] why I don't get invited over to watch
[1:55:54] football
[1:55:56] games nobody invites me over because
[1:55:58] they'll be watching the game I'll be
[1:56:00] like what's happening and I don't I mean
[1:56:01] I used to be way into it but that's
[1:56:03] completely gone out of my heart and my
[1:56:04] mind now and they'll be like this player
[1:56:07] this and he did this and he's drafted
[1:56:09] from this and he's going there and for
[1:56:10] me there's just an absolute I don't care
[1:56:14] amen not that you're evil if you care
[1:56:15] I'm not saying that but I'm no fun at a
[1:56:18] ball game cuz I'm not going to get into
[1:56:19] the spirit of it amen but if you're
[1:56:21] going to get into the spirit of it
[1:56:23] you've got to enter in yeah you've got
[1:56:26] to know who's playing on the field yeah
[1:56:29] amen like you can't enter in unless you
[1:56:31] know what's going on unless you you
[1:56:33] you've been involved unless you entered
[1:56:35] into what's happening and you know the
[1:56:37] rules of the game and you know you know
[1:56:39] the odds are the favors this and this
[1:56:41] and blah blah blah and this is an old
[1:56:43] rivalry that goes like 30 years and when
[1:56:45] you get into it it gets more exciting
[1:56:47] and more exciting and more exciting then
[1:56:49] all of a sudden you can have grown men
[1:56:51] amen they see a man men carry a piece of
[1:56:53] leather with air in it across the line
[1:56:55] and grown men jump up in their plate of
[1:56:57] nachos and chips and everything goes
[1:56:59] flying all over the
[1:57:01] place I mean that doesn't happen every
[1:57:03] time you sit down to dinner you don't
[1:57:04] just jump up and throw your food
[1:57:06] everywhere what happened they got into
[1:57:08] the spirit amen and that Spirit took
[1:57:12] control yeah and began to express itself
[1:57:15] through their vocal cords and through
[1:57:17] their
[1:57:18] body if that can happen at a ball game
[1:57:20] can it happen about the word of God
[1:57:22] can we get so in the spirit can we get

[1:58:54] Spirit as his spirit's moving and I want
[1:58:57] to be so in the spirit that the spirit
[1:58:58] has so much of me that is just

[2:01:00] start to just move out of the
[2:01:06] picture the message Christ is Myster of
[2:01:09] God revealed again he says oh if God can
[2:01:12] get him prisoners like that now that's
[2:01:15] when he can express the preeminence you
[2:01:17] see he's got the man or the person that
[2:01:19] he knows nothing but Christ you get what
[2:01:21] I mean that's secondly first to express
[2:01:23] himself completely God in Christ second
[2:01:26] to have the preeminence by this in his
[2:01:27] church which is his body the bride till
[2:01:30] he could have the preeminence to express
[2:01:32] himself through them and thirdly to
[2:01:34] restore the kingdom to its rightly
[2:01:36] position that fell by sin by the first
[2:01:38] Adam back to where he walked in the cool
[2:01:40] of the evening with his people talked
[2:01:42] with them fellowshipped with them and
[2:01:45] now sin and death had separated them
[2:01:46] from this presence in his entire
[2:01:48] expression but God is bringing us right
[2:01:51] back
[2:01:52] to it
[2:01:58] friends what is Christ need in this
[2:02:02] day he needs a
[2:02:05] body what did Adam need he needed
[2:02:08] another
[2:02:09] body to what reproduce
[2:02:12] himself in the days of the Virgin birth
[2:02:15] what did God need he needed a
[2:02:17] body and today to reproduce the Son of
[2:02:20] God to reproduce Christ on Earth what
[2:02:22] does he need he needs a
[2:02:24] body and I want him to have mine and I
[2:02:28] want to be part of that body and I want
[2:02:30] it to be his life living through
[2:02:33] me let's turn to Philippians 1 this is
[2:02:36] the last scripture we'll read together
[2:02:38] Philippians
[2:02:46] 1 Philippians chapter
[2:02:50] 1 verse 20
[2:02:57] says according to my Earnest expectation
[2:02:59] and my hope that in nothing I shall be
[2:03:01] ashamed but that with all boldness as
[2:03:04] always so now also Christ shall be
[2:03:06] magnified in my body whether it be by
[2:03:09] life or by
[2:03:13] death what was his greatest
[2:03:15] hope that whether he was going to be
[2:03:18] executed or whether he would remain a
[2:03:19] little longer because that's what he's
[2:03:20] talking about whether he'd go on or
[2:03:23] whether he'd remain that either
[2:03:26] way his great
[2:03:28] desire is that Christ should be
[2:03:30] magnified in my
[2:03:32] body whether it be by life or by death
[2:03:36] for me to live is Christ and to die is
[2:03:43] gain verse 21 I want to become my
[2:03:48] verse I want it to be for me to live is
[2:03:52] Christ if I remain in this earth and I
[2:03:55] remain on I don't want it to be my life
[2:03:57] remaining I want it to be Christ so for
[2:04:00] me to live I want Christ to be magnified
[2:04:02] in me and for me to live I want it to be
[2:04:04] Christ and if I die it's gain but if I
[2:04:08] live I want it to be Christ Living in me
[2:04:12] Amen brother brenon made this statement
[2:04:15] this the last thing I want to share with
[2:04:16] you in the message
[2:04:19] Paradox so the thing of it is he done it
[2:04:21] because because he could go in the name
[2:04:22] of the Lord God only needs one man in
[2:04:26] his hand he can do the rest of
[2:04:29] it talking about Moses talking about
[2:04:32] other great great what we call Heroes of
[2:04:35] the Bible said God only needs one man in
[2:04:38] his hand and when he says one man in his
[2:04:40] hand he's talking about a man that he
[2:04:42] has complete control of and he preaches
[2:04:44] about this and and Paul a prisoner Paul
[2:04:47] was bound by chains of love to Christ he
[2:04:49] had surrendered everything and given
[2:04:51] everything up and counted it all his
[2:04:52] dung that he might win Christ and he was
[2:04:54] in the hand of God and God could turn
[2:04:56] him any way he wanted amen Moses after
[2:04:58] all his beatings and all his sufferings
[2:05:00] he came into God's hand amen and all God
[2:05:02] needs is one man in his hand he can do
[2:05:06] the rest
[2:05:09] Amen brother said he went down and took
[2:05:12] over the whole nation with a stick in
[2:05:15] his hand that wasn't Moses that was
[2:05:18] Christ in Moses because after all his
[2:05:21] failures and his beatdowns and there was
[2:05:23] a meeting at the with a pillar of fire
[2:05:25] at the burning bush that told him who he
[2:05:27] was and what was going to happen and if
[2:05:30] he just held on to that God would finish
[2:05:32] the work and he finally got Moses in his
[2:05:36] hand man we may have been around this
[2:05:38] message all of our Lives we may have
[2:05:40] heard about it known about it we may
[2:05:41] have been in and out and up and down
[2:05:44] and right but I want to be found in his
[2:05:47] hand I think it's time to get in his
[2:05:50] hand amen amen I think it's time to stop
[2:05:53] with our own agenda our own ideas our
[2:05:55] own wishes our own plans our own
[2:05:57] whatever I think it's time to stop with
[2:05:58] that and just get in his hand and he can
[2:06:01] do the
[2:06:03] rest I believe Mighty things are coming
[2:06:06] amen but I do not believe Mighty things
[2:06:09] and manifestations are
[2:06:11] coming unless we're completely
[2:06:13] surrendered to Christ and we get over
[2:06:16] ourselves and stop injecting ourselves
[2:06:18] and stop wanting to be important and
[2:06:20] wanting to be special and wanting be
[2:06:21] seen in wanting to get credit I don't
[2:06:24] think a thing's going to happen until
[2:06:25] that attitude washes out of us am till
[2:06:29] we get to the place where I have no
[2:06:31] thought coming I don't know what's going
[2:06:33] to happen I don't know how to do it but
[2:06:35] I know he'll do it and I didn't do it he
[2:06:37] did it can you imagine somebody walking
[2:06:40] up to the Virgin Mary amen years later
[2:06:42] and said oh thank you so much for
[2:06:45] bringing forth
[2:06:47] Christ he say are you kidding me I
[2:06:51] had nothing to do with it it just
[2:06:53] something he did in me I was just there
[2:06:56] when he did
[2:06:59] it oh can we get to that place where we
[2:07:02] don't inject ourselves or take some
[2:07:04] pride and oh that was that was a
[2:07:06] wonderful Miracle yeah I had been
[2:07:08] praying three days before I just kind of
[2:07:10] felt that there was stop all that
[2:07:13] nonsense and just be real and honest and
[2:07:15] say listen I had nothing to do with it
[2:07:17] that was all God and if you were praying
[2:07:20] three days before it's because God moved
[2:07:21] moved on your heart to pray not because
[2:07:22] you knew
[2:07:24] anything we got to get to the place
[2:07:26] where we're just an empty vessel just to
[2:07:27] empty out and brother B said The more we
[2:07:29] can empty out the more he can fill up
[2:07:32] and I want more than little petty
[2:07:34] trickles of little special things that I
[2:07:36] try to get special credit for listen if
[2:07:38] God will use whatever you surrender to
[2:07:40] him but I want him to have the whole
[2:07:42] vessel so that he can do things that
[2:07:43] we've never thought
[2:07:45] of and then when he does it we'll be
[2:07:47] like
[2:07:49] wow that was a amazing
[2:07:54] Amen brother B comes to the end of
[2:07:57] preaching the seals he says now don't
[2:08:00] say thank you to any man amen and listen
[2:08:04] I'm grateful to him for staying in the
[2:08:06] little room and waiting for the truth
[2:08:08] but brother B said don't say thank you
[2:08:10] nothing he said that wasn't a man that
[2:08:12] didn't come of my own mind that wasn't
[2:08:13] my doing that was
[2:08:17] God I want to get to the place where we
[2:08:19] can say don't say thank you not that we
[2:08:22] don't appreciate each other we should do
[2:08:23] that but with our mind we understand I'm
[2:08:25] thankful that that came through my
[2:08:27] brother but that was God Amen that was
[2:08:30] Christ my brother can't do that I mean I
[2:08:32] like him and he's special and all but he
[2:08:34] can't do
[2:08:35] that he can't live that humble he can't
[2:08:37] live that surrendered he can't have that
[2:08:39] much wisdom he can't remember that many
[2:08:41] Bible
[2:08:42] verses that was
[2:08:45] God I don't know about you but I want to
[2:08:47] empty out and I want to surrender let's
[2:08:51] all St
[2:08:56] stand I find it the greatest privilege
[2:08:59] of my life to be counted a member of
[2:09:02] this
[2:09:03] body the body of
[2:09:06] Christ and I want to be faithful to what
[2:09:09] he's called me to do the only thing I
[2:09:11] can do to be faithful is not inject
[2:09:13] myself and just stay out of it stay
[2:09:17] surrendered and have
[2:09:19] confidence that God really never asked
[2:09:22] me to do
[2:09:24] anything he just told me to believe him
[2:09:27] he would do it and I believe he
[2:09:30] will so I want to walk forward with
[2:09:34] confidence not arrogance not superficial
[2:09:38] just confident that I don't know what's
[2:09:41] going to happen next and I don't know
[2:09:43] how to solve the problems I don't have
[2:09:44] the answer but I'm confident he'll do
[2:09:46] something because he made promises and
[2:09:49] I'm doing what he called me to do the
[2:09:51] best I I know to do it and I'm confident
[2:09:53] that he'll work the rest out all he
[2:09:55] needs is a man in his hand he can do the
[2:09:58] rest you believe that amen you believe
[2:10:01] he can do the rest amen oh God take me
[2:10:05] in your hand take me in your hand let's
[2:10:09] bow our heads
[2:10:11] together dear Lord Jesus we're so
[2:10:13] thankful Lord for this
[2:10:15] message God there's no way we could have
[2:10:17] known these things until this hour and
[2:10:19] we could have never known unless you and
[2:10:21] a prophet and we could have never heard
[2:10:24] that Prophet unless you gave us ears to
[2:10:26] hear if you hadn't Lord ordained it we
[2:10:29] would never know we would we would just
[2:10:32] be marching on in life as anybody else
[2:10:35] is marching on in life doing the best we
[2:10:38] know how to do lost and confused but God
