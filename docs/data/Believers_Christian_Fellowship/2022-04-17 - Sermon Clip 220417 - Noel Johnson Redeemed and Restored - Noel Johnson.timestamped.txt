[0:00] this is me or us
[0:03] this is him
[0:10] that's all
[0:11] god
[0:12] sees
[0:16] brother branham says god hears our voice
[0:19] speaking
[0:20] through the blood
[0:22] so when we net when we bow our knees or
[0:24] however we pray and we begin to speak
[0:27] unto god it's not us
[0:28] it's us speaking through him
[0:31] and that's all he sees
[0:33] he hears our voice
[0:35] speaking to him and therefore he will
[0:38] hear us because we are the righteousness
[0:40] of god himself because we are in him we
[0:43] are we are part of him
[0:46] satan will tell you oh he said why would
[0:48] god hear your prayers
[0:51] i mean look at the life that you live
[0:54] look at the mistakes that you make
[0:57] oh do you remember the mistakes from
[0:58] yesterday oh yeah that was bad what
[1:01] about last week remember that incident
[1:04] last week
[1:05] oh yeah that was terrible oh and then
[1:08] you think you're going to pray to god
[1:09] and god hear you
[1:11] well man i guess not you know i mean why
[1:14] would god hear hear me being a sinner
[1:17] but i'm not a sinner
[1:19] i'm him
[1:23] you are the very righteousness of god
[1:26] himself
[1:27] because you are in
[1:30] him
[1:31] what did god do with adam and eve in the
[1:32] garden
[1:34] they sinned
[1:35] so what did god do
[1:37] he went looking for them for one and
[1:39] they were hiding in the bushes
[1:42] and god says oh you made a mistake
[1:45] okay
[1:46] things are going to change
[1:48] but then god went out and he found two
[1:50] animals he slew those animals and he
[1:52] took the sacrifices of those animals and
[1:55] gave it to adam and eve
[1:57] whenever god looked at adam and eve what
[1:59] did he do all he saw was the sacrifice
[2:02] he was reminded constantly the price for
[2:04] their sins had been paid for and now i
[2:06] can have fellowship with them and what
[2:08] did god do for us he slew he he hung up
[2:11] on the cross for my sins
[2:14] and so what did he do he clothed me in
[2:16] that sacrifice
[2:18] so now what does he do whenever he looks
[2:20] at me he has to see the sacrifice
[2:22] because i am in him and because i am in
[2:25] him i am the very righteousness of god
