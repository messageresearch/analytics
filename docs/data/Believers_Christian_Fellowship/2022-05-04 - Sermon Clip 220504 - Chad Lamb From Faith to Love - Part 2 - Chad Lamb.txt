========================================

so what is that spirit that we received it's the spirit of adoption the spirit that will take us to adoption because we've been predestinated to the adoption of children by jesus christ so all these scriptures paint the same picture when we start talking about the virtues and we start talking about the statue of a perfect man if we don't set the foundation right in the word it can become a discouraging conversation because we begin to look at these virtues and say well i mean i've got to measure up to all of this and i've got to add to this to this to this to this but if we don't have the basis of understanding we can get discouraged when there's nothing discouraging in this doctrine whatsoever amen this message did not come to discourage us this message came to give us life this message didn't come to push us away it came to put us in position amen so everything in this message came to unlock our understanding to bring us into our rightful position so there's nothing discouraging in the message amen if the message is presented in a discouraging way it's the wrong ankle preached the wrong way amen and and trying to make you the wrong recipient amen but if you're the bride of jesus christ this message came to lift you up and to put you in position to manifest the life of jesus christ and that was according to his purpose and his will not your purpose and not your will so you've been predestinated to make it to the stature of a perfect man now that begins to flip the whole idea on its head and take it out of our carnal mind and it becomes an exciting doctrine because now this is me amen this is what i am this is who god wants me to be this is what i've been birthed on this earth to express amen it's all mine by these promises by these precious prominence i've been made a partaker of the divine nature so i can partake of this divine nature and become the very thing that i'm looking at and that was god's purpose from before the foundation of the world there's no discouragement here there's only encouragement saying this is you keep climbing amen this is you keep climbing where am i going to stop i'm not going to stop i'm going all the way to the top to express the full life of jesus christ because that's why i was put on this earth and that's why i was born again by the spirit of god
