TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] who truly believes [Music] that i do it will be done by is that he is the same yesterday when jesus ascended his word he commanded us [Music] be endured when the holy ghost comes on you praise god oh he's alive is [Music] [Music] how [Music] just worship him tonight [Music] [Music] worship no matter what you age [Music] [Music] hello oh oh let's just pray together [Music] precious lord jesus we just want to pause here for a moment to approach you by way of prayer lord to thank you once again for this opportunity to gather together with your chosen people lord to gather together around you the revealed word for our hour and father as we just saying we're so grateful lord that we do have an opportunity to come and to worship you lord and we don't want to take that for granted and lord we're so grateful that that we have that desire to come and to worship you because we know that only you can place that there lord father but even with that being placed there what type of miserable people we would be if we didn't know how to worship you lord or what she was desiring in worship father but you have came and you have revealed yourself to us father and you have opened yourself your word to us lord that you could reveal the secrets to us to let us know how you want to be worshiped and how to appropriately come before your throne lord and we would just pray that we would never take that for granted to have a desire to worship the true god and to know how that he wishes to be to worship father and we just want to come this evening we want to commit the speaker to you we want to commit to hear to you father we just we just ask as we always do father that you would come now and that you would pick up your word and you would loose the seals from the father that you would pick up the bread and that you would break it lord for no man can do this task lord we're we're not saying that to be humble lord it's just the facts we realize that we can't do it that there has to be a supernatural element come at this point in time father to pick up a gift that you would place in a hybrid vessel and that you would minister a pure word we just yield ourselves to you lord thanking you for this opportunity in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you if you'll take your bibles we'll turn to revelation chapter 22. it's good to be with you this evening appreciate the atmosphere i want to say god bless you brother tommy and sister barb it's good to have you back we sure missed you i just want to continue [Music] this evening on this topic that i administered on last time on the words of the book and it was kind of a little bit of a strange service for me there at the end i really thought that i was going to get to the end of it and wrap it up but for whatever reason he just said stop so i stopped but brother chad had came the next several services and really just preached everything that i had left so i don't really know the the dynamics of how all of that works sometimes all we know to do is stop and we just have to you know rely on that so you'll have to forgive me if there's a lot of repeat in some of this but i didn't feel the need to go back and change my notes just because he already preached it i just say if that's what god once said then i'm happy to be an echo you know i have zero problems being an echo but we certainly appreciate the word that is being ministered and maybe this will just be uh kind of the same thing in a little bit of a different angle and we'll maybe uh ring a little bit different bell with somebody to bring their attention to somebody to something in particular but that's the direction that i want to try to finish up with this evening so we'll read here in revelation 22 verse 18 and it says for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things that are written in this book and then if you'll turn with me over to ephesians 4 we want to read a portion of scripture there ephesians 4 beginning with verse 15. and it says but speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working and the measure of every part maketh increase of the body and to the edifying of itself in love and then for our last scripture we'll turn back to revelation chapter eight very familiar verse here revelation chapter eight just the one verse and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour god bless you as you would have your seats so if we'll just if you'll bear with me just to do a quick review here um again we were laying emphasis on the words of the book being the believer and that we understand that the book of genesis in the book of revelation is a book of symbols and the ultimate reality of those symbols are you and i um we know even in god's first creation that he created and he would start out with with certain things but at the end of that his final reality was a man and then he took a wife from that man so we understand that god brother brandon says god's heart desire what was moving god what he wanted all the time was he wanted to express himself in flesh so that is the reality we can look at symbols and we can we can look at whatever we want to look at but at the end of the day we have to have a reality and we have to understand what that real reality is and what god is trying to get to and at the end of the day what god is trying to get to is me and you so that's that's the purpose and that's what we want to what we want to drive at in the invisible union brother random said dear god we have just read what we believe to be the sacred word of god and that's what we are believing that not one jot nor tittle shall in no wise pass away from this until it is all fulfilled and we believe that our lord told us in revelation the 22nd chapter that whosoever shall take wor one word from it or add one word to it the same his part will be taken from the book of life and we see that by misrepresentation of this world as word as satan misrepresented it to eve caused her to doubt one word through the whole human race into fallen chaos remember that we're going to touch on that at the end of the service but when satan did that remember in genesis 1 1 brother brandon said he brought the word out of chaos but now when he comes and he trips up eve we're back into chaos just one word then we see in the middle of the book came our lord and savior and he gave us this quotation concerning that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the solemn morning in the last book of the revelation of jesus christ who whosoever shall add a word or take a word away his part will be taken from the book of life oh god knowing seeing how fragile we are knowing that we're walking on the brittle threads of this mortal life not knowing what time we're going to be summons to answer on high let us oh lord lay aside everything in our heart everything in our mind and look straight to your word tonight and for you to come and interpret it with living oracles so again we're back to the reality we have the word we have the written word we have the interpretation of the symbols we have the expressed word but now brother branham is saying i'm i'm asking and i'm praying for god to come and interpret this himself by interpreting it through living oracles the final reality so if that is what brother branham is praying for i would just assume that you being a common person like me that would be our prayer if that's what he's praying for i think that's what we should be praying for so we appreciate the interpretation if we want to say it this way the teaching of the doctrines and the interpretation of the symbols but that wasn't just brother branham's prayer his prayer that is that god himself would come on the scene and interpret it in our lives things that are to be i'm going to kind of go fast here because we we really spent a lot of time on this this last time and i believe that the foundation was slayed but i just want to skip through this real fast things that are to be he says we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any man's wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god so if we're looking for the manifestation of god in this hour what should we be looking for very simple a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living so if you're looking for the words of the book to be a reality what should you be looking for christ is the mystery of god revealed again another very familiar quote now do you see the seals when he's in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book so that should put any doubt or confusion in our mind away from what god is looking for god is not looking for ink plots on paper we would never degrade this we would never do away with this thank god that he gave us this because in our wretched broken down condition we needed every tool that we could get our hands on but at the end of the day god is not going around looking for pieces of paper he's looking for the words in the book that's the believer and the word is him and all that's in and all that's in that he came forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb souls that are in prison now 1963 brother branham says what if it is he's asking what if it is this time look at the scriptures piled here could it be is the third pull to preach to the eternal eternally doomed that's rejected the message of salvation will you say the church is going yeah they will they'll go right on just the same but remember all this time noah was in the ark the bride is sealed in with christ the last member has been redeemed the sixth seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to earth this is very profound we've we've had decades of teaching and studying and wondered number one is this is the seals even open and then it'll come to the seventh seal is the seventh seal even open but now brother branham would come and he would say the seventh seal brings him back to earth so now we have to go through the whole rigging road again oh okay brought him back to earth okay he was in brother branham but that's not where he's that's not where he stopped at because brother branham's off the scene so if the seventh seal brought him back to earth in the fullness of his word in the form of the prophet and that prophet goes off the scene we only have one of two options either god is not here or he went somewhere else the seventh seal brings him back to earth the lamb came and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claimed what he owed what he owned what he had redeemed that right it's always been that third pull three is perfection the ministry come to its perfection when it reproduced christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted [Music] as it was in the days of lot so he's referring back to as it was in the days of lot we know what happened on the plains of memory when god himself came down in the form of a human being spoke to abraham but i want to throw something else in here again the ministry come to its perfection when it reproduced christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of lot so he's saying as it was in the days of lot it's going to happen now and that is the perfection that's this third pull so what happened in the days of lot it was god himself took on the form of man and came down and spoke with abraham had fellowship with another human being that was what brother branham says the ministry come to its perfection so now let's look at revelation 8. revelation 8 1. the ministry come to its perfection when it reproduced christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of lot revelation 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour you say well those how do those correspond together because brother brandon says the seventh seal brought him back to earth and he just says the perfection of the ministry was when he reproduced christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of lot and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven it did not say there was silence on earth and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven now we can understand why brother branham says the seventh still brings him back to earth there was silence in heaven why was there silence in heaven because he's not in heaven anymore there was silence in heaven not on earth brother branham says those thundered thunders did not sound from heaven he says they sounded from earth and the seventh seal brought him to earth don't leave all of that past tense don't leave all of that past tense in the 50s and the 60s when the symbols were being exposed brother branham says it came to its perfection when it reproduced christ again amongst natural human beings as it was in the days of lot so brother branham could have came and he could have preached the seals and he could have revealed all of the symbols and it still would not have been in its perfection because it came to its perfection the seventh seal came to its perfection when it brought him back to earth when it reproduced christ again in natural human beings so don't leave it in the days of lot don't leave it in the 50s or the 60s allow it to produce its perfection again amongst natural human beings and as i said i said this last time but i want to say it again because this is i feel this is very pertinent the mind of god has been expressed we would all agree with that i believe in the fullness of its word the mind of god has been expressed but the mind of god is not just here because the symbols have been interpreted the mind of god is here because the people that that mind consisted of are here does that make sense so we can have the interpretation of the symbols but if there is no perfection of that if there is no reality of that then that mind has not has still not been completely revealed it takes a natural human being in flesh to bring that and express that so we can have the mind of god revealed inter as the as the written word interpreted but unless the people are here to believe that and to live that into an ex and to express that it still has not come to its perfection and quite frankly the book has still not been loosed because the words in the book are the believer and until that word is expressed through a believer it has not been it has not come to its perfection in the masterpiece it says now for nearly 2000 years god has again been making him a masterpiece because he struck adam to get a piece off of him part of a rib to make a wife for him and now the perfect masterpiece that he struck at calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the new testament that's all so now you don't have to wonder if this is just a good thought that i've made up and i am sharing it here is brother branham explicitly saying that the bride that is taken from christ is the new testament she is the words in the book she is the final interpretation of the symbols her daily life the thunder that shakes the devil the third pull coming to its perfection the seventh seal that's bringing him to earth the bride the new testament that's all she is just the new testament that's all that's all you are not much just the new testament that's all praise the lord he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and oldest husband and wife see and it takes the old to foreshadow the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece is in the making as is taking him 4 000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2 000 years making another masterpiece a bride for christ another masterpiece just the new testament that's all so if you think a little bit of yourself you're just remember you're just the new testament that's all that you are 1962 an absolute and this is the quote that i shared with you last time that really all of this inspiration uh spurred from he says listen i want to tell you something he had a purpose in saving me he had a purpose in saving you and i am determined by his will to do it not to add to it or take away from it revelation 22 19. so as we expressed last time brother branham took the purpose of his life and he stuck it in the scriptures and he's and he said if you would take away from the purpose of my life that's the same as what is speaking in revelation 22 19 you if you take away from the purpose of my life you are taking away from the words of the book your name will be taken out of the book of life if you were to if you were to try to hinder his ministry his purpose that was equivalent to taking words out of the book but you remember he says he had a purpose in saving me he had a purpose in saving you and then he says i am determined to do it by his will not to add take it or take away from it according to revelation 22 19. so he put you in there as well before he referenced revelation 22 19. so now anybody that would hinder or to take away from your purpose would be equivalent to taking words out of the book or adding words to the book and as i shared last time we could get all worked up about that like yeah somebody's trying to stomp me down they're trying to run my ministry they're trying to take out this part that i serve they're trying to do this they're trying to do that and we can get all worked up about that but my real question is what are you doing about it what am i doing about it because if somebody would take away from my part of the book of life god will deal with them that's what uh forgive me i think it was michael you know when when they were disputing about the body of moses he's he just he just told him he says the lord deal with you the lord the lord he knew where he stood he knew where he stood he just said the lord will deal with you so i'm not concerned if somebody's going to try to wait take away from my part of the book of life because quite frankly if they could take away from my part of the book of life it's not in the book of life because heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not fail so maybe it's something that i've added to the word that they're taking away from and it probably needs taken away from them but if somebody is really genuinely attacking my and when i say this i know a lot of a lot of times we would automatically think okay you're a minister you stand behind the pulpit you preach that's true but but that's i would say that's the minor that i'm speaking about i'm talking about the real purpose for my life that god has for me so don't just say oh yeah that applies to a minister it don't just apply to a minister it applies to each and every one of us that's just a small portion but if somebody would try to take away from the purpose god had in saving me what dangerous treacherous grounds they're on but like i said i'm not even concerned if they do that because that's not the real enemy the real enemy is me the real enemy is what am i getting distracted by what am i doing that would hinder him fulfilling his purpose for saving me that's the real issue because god will deal with somebody else i don't even need to give them the time god will deal with them but i need god to deal with me and i need to be honest with myself and i need to scrutinize myself what if anything am i doing that would add to or take away his purpose for saving me and that's that's really my what i'm trying to express from my heart here is i have to be honest and i've got to be real and i've got to examine that and if there's something there i've got to deal with it and each and every one of you has to do the same the external influence is not what we're fighting the external influence is not what we're fighting it's going to be an internal issue that's going to be detrimental that's what we need to focus on that's what we need to deal with and that's what we need to examine each and every day am i doing anything that is adding to or taking away from the real purpose of my life that god had been saving me doors and doors 1965 some time ago i read a story of the days of lincoln he was deprived of an education but yet with something in his heart some purpose i like a man of vision i like people that's got something they're fighting for just not just laying around well whatever comes along will be all right be up and add it now this is not a motivational speech this this is a reality this is not a this is not a pep rally to get you all riled up of oh yeah i'm gonna go do something for god that's that's not it this that this is a pep rally for you to seek god and find out what he wants you to do and what the purpose is for your life and then go do it but this is not a this is not just a motivator or speech motivational speech of yeah i want to do something for god be up and at it go and do it that could end up really good that could end up really really bad that's not what we're after what we're after is to find the purpose of our life to find the words in the book because the words in the book is what won't fail me and you will fail in our hybrid condition but the word that's in us will not fail the purpose that he had for saving us will not fail and that's what we have to have and then once we find that i would say be motivated be have a pep rally go and do it be about it have a vision but it's not it's just not frivolous we have to seek the purpose first be up and at it and lincoln never had let his education stand in the way he had something to do i think every christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it in that order find your purpose and then go do it for every member of this chapter just not well we have a breakfast once once a month that isn't it or once every saturday have a purpose in life something you're going to do god has placed you here do something about it so he is motivating you to do something about it but look at the order that he puts it in find your purpose not of yourself allow god to reveal that to you find your purpose and then go do something about it so thank you for allowing me the time to do the review let's move forward the identified masterpiece of god then the sad story comes of the enemy now notice this one thing i want you to bear in mind that god gave this man a protection he's speaking of adam he gave him he fortified him inside of his word because he told them what they could do what they could not do he placed him behind his word how did he do that he told him what he could do and what he couldn't do he revealed to him the purpose of his life and that was equivalent to god placing him behind his word now you must never get from behind that when you do you're opening the door to the enemy when you get outside of the purpose for your life you are opening the door for the enemy when they say oh well you can do a little bit of this and a little bit of that god wants you to separate yourself from everything that's called sin completely set aside for him and for him only he has a purpose in your life each individual that no one else on the face of the earth can take your place god has got something for you you're made like that you as did that way for a purpose god is sovereign in his work he makes men different he gives us each one a different place nobody can take your place and you shouldn't try to take anybody else's place goes both ways nobody can take your place and you shouldn't try to take somebody else's place because you are an individual to god and god has a purpose for you he made you thus you say why did he do it he is sovereign he's got a reason for it being that way but we find out that we're all guarded by the word how are we guarded by the word because each and every one of us have a specific purpose and when we stay in that purpose we're guarded by the word that is equivalent to being guarded by the word look at the emphasis look at the seriousness of this look how important we should view this we're literally talking about the words in the book saints and he has said heaven and earth would pass away but my words would not pass away how earnestly we should seek god how much preeminence we should seek we should give him i don't believe that we should we should go a day without acknowledging him as the scripture says acknowledge me and i will direct your paths so what happens if you don't acknowledge him he's not going to direct your paths but look at the seriousness of that god himself has said heaven and earth will pass away but the purpose of my bride's individual's life that will not pass away that will stand but that's only true if we're seeking him for that purpose and we have the true purpose not just something we think is the purpose not just something we want to do not just something we think is right but the real genuine thing it's serious it's not a game i believe if we could really ever catch a glimpse into our true position and what it means we would approach our daily lives much different and i say that for me not just for you i really believe if we could comprehend the seriousness of that just think of the statement brother bran made he says when that bride go when that bride goes there's no more mercy just look at that one single statement and the impact that that has look at the seriousness look how detrimental it is that we get this right and we're not going to get it right on our own saints it's impossible we're going to mess it up every time we have got to earnestly seek him for this revelation why did he do it because he is sovereign but we find out that we're all guarded by the word in heaven we look at the celestial bodies he's referring to the stars brother chad quoted this it was amazing to me so i'm not going to go into it but i've been looking at this this quote that brother branham said about the stars he says you see a shooting star or a star falling he says no you didn't he says you saw some type of weather light you know you know a clinker or something like that he says if one of those real true celestial bodies one of those real true stars would ever move position everything would go into chaos and we know that's true we know that's true because remember god expressed himself in three ways he first expressed himself in the heavenly bodies he expressed himself in the pyramid and then he expressed himself in the written word and the fourth the reality he expressed himself in your non-life so if one of those celestial bodies would move one of those real stars that represents us one of those stars that represents us would move from its position brother branham says it would cause chaos in the whole heavenly realm if you would go over to the pyramid and you would take a little chisel and you would out one of those stones that you thought was insignificant what do you think is going to happen to the pyramid it's going to crumble now it might not crumble in a day it might not crumble in a week it might not crumble in a month it may not even crumble in 400 years but if you take that stone out of there eventually eventually that pyramid is going to come down because if we're the words in the book were the stones in the pyramid and were the stars in the heavens where does that put our daily life what significance you say oh it's just one little stone you can take that out it's going to crumble the body of christ without each and every individual in their position fulfilling the purpose is going to crumble we just read that in ephesians 4 he says every joint has to supply you can't take one of those joints out and expect it to work it's not going to so even if it's a small little stone in the very corner of that pyramid i want it to stay there the same as i don't want one word taken out of this take one word out of this and it's going to crumble your daily life is on the same level it has to be there it has to be in the right spot doing the right thing and it cannot be moved the bible says that even one star differs from the other and there is angels such as there is serpents and cherubims and angels and great angels in degrees and even in the new world to come the kings of the earth bring their honor into the city we're always going to be that way because god is not a sears and robot harmony house he is a god of variety he makes one one way and one another but we must serve him in the way that god has made us and be glad and stay behind the word serve him in the way that he made you be glad about it and stay behind his word stay in your purpose 1963 why christ speak brother branham says moses being born with this great gift of faith then he was anointed and commissioned at the burning bush to deliver god's people now see what qualifies man to be great now see what great qualities this man had he was born for a certain thing god had a purpose in it god has a purpose of you being here if you can only be get to that place how much trouble you save god and yourself to that's self-explanatory i don't think i need to expound on that 1963 influence now we find out uzziah got lifted up and he's going to do it anyhow remember this is when uzziah goes in to the temple where he's not supposed to be and he says he's going to do it anyhow he grabbed up the censer and took off it didn't make any difference what the priest said didn't make any difference what they preached different didn't make any difference what the ministry said they're going to do it anyhow it didn't make any difference what the priest said he was going to do it anyhow and it was against the scripture it was unscriptural for him to do that can we all say amen listen what he says next it's unscriptural for you or i to impersonate anyone else what happened to uzziah when he went in there and took a position that he didn't belong in the ministry is trying to warn them maybe they even tugged on the shirt tell said don't do it maybe they tried to physically restrain them but brother brandon said he's going to do it anyhow and he did it and how did he end up smitten with leprosy brother brandon says leprosy re is is a sign of sin so if you try to fulfill somebody else's position or i'll just say it like he said if you try to impersonate anyone else it is unscriptural he doesn't just say it's a bad idea like you shouldn't do that like it's annoying like people will notice it's unscriptural where is he getting that where is he getting that it's unscriptural for you to impersonate somebody else revelation 22 18. [Music] because the purpose of your life is the words in the book and if somebody else would try to impersonate that it's unscriptural so it's the same for you if you would try to impersonate somebody else's position it's unscriptural and you like i said you'll have to forgive me if some of this is repeat but i i just did not feel to to change my notes to change my direction but i feel that it's relevant i feel that it's important i feel that it's true we have to have a good proper understanding of our position of our calling of our uniqueness of our purpose as individuals in life right so be what you are and be a good one and fulfill your purpose so others can see you if you're a housewife be a real one see if you're a husband be a genuine if you're a deacon be a genuine or a preacher whatever you are but don't try to take somebody else's place this is one of my favorite quotes here it just blew my mind when he when he said this 1964 identification says that wasn't moses's thought he was only doing what god had ordained him to do all of them didn't have to be moses the people only had to follow what he said everyone didn't have to create and do miracles and things that's what's the trouble with people today a lady asked me coming down the road the other day from up here she said brother branham i fast and fast and fast and i still can't cast out devils i said he wasn't born to do such your duty is too fast how profound she's doing something naturally and she's excellent at it and she fast and she fast and she fast but she's all bothered because she can't cast out devils but now a vindicated prophet would come on the scene and it was probably the easiest question that he had that day that's simple sis you weren't born for that your duty is to fast now listen the holy spirit is working on somebody else out there for that to cast out the devils i would hate to be the minister or the one that's to cast out the devil who's done it now for three years straight because of this little lady fasting and she gets a complex i would say that we could agree here she had a complex brother branham said who it was i believe it was sister shakarian she's got a complex she can't cast out a devil i would hate to be the guy that because she got that complex she didn't fast that day and here i am amongst thousands of people brother branham is ministering to thousands of people casting out demons left and right maybe not even brother branham maybe other ministers we won't want to limit the holy spirit to one ministry at that point in time there were healing and and faith ministries all over the place so who knows she may have been operating all of them but what about the guy who's there doing this but she got a complex and says i'm taking the day off he falls flat on his face and now everybody blames him because he can't cast out a devil but he can't do anything unless this little lady fasts because that's her purpose and this is his purpose so how can this guy get all big and proud of himself for casting out devils when in all reality his only power comes from this little lady who has a complex she can't cast out a single devil and all she can do is fast you say well that's real that's real elementary that's how it works saints that is the reality of it that is how it works literally brother branham looked into her life said you weren't born for that you were born for this and somebody else is born for that and unless they both work in tandem unless they both can come to an agreement and a confidence towards god that this is my position i'm going to do it i'm going to be glad and i'm going to be happy and i'm going to let him work out whatever he needs to work out they'll save themselves a lot of trouble and got a lot of trouble because what if she just has it in her mind that unless i can cast out a devil i'm not doing anything else i don't know how many ministries would have went off the scene but it was pertinent that she did that that was her part that's what brother bran says she was born for the holy spirit is working on somebody else out there for that you don't know your place if we had time we'd like to teach those things in long meetings how that one person is burdened like this for something over here you don't know you don't and not it's not for you to know it's him doing it you're just submissive to your call and always line it up with the scripture see if it's right or not your name is not scratched off the book of life when god setting up on his ivory throne with his scroll and his feather pen goes down the list and says bad boy scratches it off your name is scratched off the book of life when you fail to fulfill the purpose wherein he has called you or you try to fulfill somebody else's purpose because that's when you add to or take away from the book and the penalty for that is your name is taken off the book of life because we're properly taught we can always have the argument to that i'm bride my name can't be taken off the book and i'll agree 100 but you're sure going to cause yourself a lot of trouble and god a lot of trouble if you don't find your purpose and stay there i'm not i'm not worried about your name been taken off or my name been taken off we've been properly taught we have an understanding of that but if you think that i'm convinced that we can't cause god a lot of trouble or our brothers and sisters a lot of trouble or ourselves a lot of trouble you're in a different dimension than what i am and please help me to get there how much rest that i no doubt how much rest that brought to that little lady she's all tore up and bothered that she can't cast out a devil a vindicator prophet says don't worry about it you're not called for that you're called the fast you mean you mean the thing that i just do naturally i'm called to do that's why brother branham says god's gift always find their places because it's god's gift not your gift and god's gift will always find its places because the words of the book cannot pass away even if heavens and earth do so why in the world would god create a individual and purpose them to do something that is totally against how he has wired their nature and how he has made them i'm not talking about your hybrid nature i'm talking about your born-again godly holy spirit nature and gifts why would god why would god want me to sing specials i wasn't born for such why would he want me to play the piano i'm not wired for that i couldn't tell you if it was on key or off key or if you needed a key to start it i don't know i know when it works right and i like it but outside of that i don't know but he's wired me for a certain thing he's made me for a certain thing it would be laughable you all have already confirmed that it would be laughable for me to do that now i'm not saying god can't pick me up once or twice and maybe annoy me to sing this special maybe i'll do it next week just to prove that it can i don't know but i'm saying my regular calling my regular duty my regularly my regular purpose it's not to lay before god for songs and for anoint to singing it's to lay before god for inspiration out of the word to teach and to preach that's what comes naturally to me i'm an analytical person why would it be unnatural for me to teach out of the scripture brother branham was wired that way he would have a complex and a meltdown because his gun wouldn't shoot right he would be out in the woods hunting squirrels and bawling like a baby because his gun won't drive tax and god says i made you that way so you wouldn't compromise on the word it's really that simple saints i would encourage you that if you found yourself in a complex or worked up about something or trying to push yourself or make something happen chances are it's not your position because god's gifts always find their places and it works you don't have to make it work remember it's god's gifts and don't don't get hung up on that when and when i say gifts it's not minutes just ministry gifts it's positions in the body it's your spiritual position in christ it's not just a five-fold ministry so you don't have an easy out there you can't say oh i'm not a minister that don't apply to me no it applies to you maybe the only reason that i can get up here and go for an hour an hour and a half two hours three hours whatever we end up at tonight is because somebody prayed about it maybe somebody fasted about it i don't know i don't i don't know whatever it is whatever god has in place to make it work i sure don't want it to stop though because i don't want to be the preaching is foolishness enough let alone when you're up here and you ain't got nothing to say or you can't pick up any inspiration out of the word i don't know maybe somebody was praying six weeks ago when this inspiration started maybe somebody was praying and fasting six weeks ago when brother chad was preaching that and i picked this out of that quote and it just struck with me and inspiration went we don't know maybe it was a year ago we don't know how all the intricate details work and brother branham says it's not our place to know don't worry about it find your purpose be glad in it and stay in it don't deviate away from it because if you deviate away from it you're on a white horse you wonder why you see so many ministries fall off the ledge into just sin and immorality not just pulpit ministries ministries one day they're standing for christ proclaiming it boldly next thing you know they're a homosexual or whatever else is because they got on a white horse and got in a position or a purpose that wasn't theirs and they wouldn't repent so they ended up defending that position on the red horse you all know the pattern i don't need to continue that pattern will not fail it won't fail for you and it won't fail for me it doesn't ever fail out of position you're on a white horse you better repent because if not you're not going to stay on that horse for very long that pattern will not fail so just relax be comfortable in what god has called you to do be comfortable in what god has given you naturally brother branham says most of the time people who have gifts don't even know they have the gift but it's p it's easy for other people to recognize it it's because they just see it and it's well that person just does that naturally but it's a gift they're not necessarily trying because it's god anointing that gift they don't have to try i would be worried about something you have to try to do for god if you're trying to do it i would be worried i would be i would be concerned because if there's not an anointing that just makes it work something's out of place something's not right the holy spirit flows brother bran says the holy spirit is timid the holy spirit is not going to come down and just shove something in the holy spirit is going to flow it's going to work it's going to fit it's going to be natural even if somebody else is attacking that and trying to make it deviate or trying to take your place or trying to take away from your purpose god will deal with that if it's god's gift he's given it for a purpose he's not just going to throw it out there for randomly if he's given a gift it's for a purpose he's going to make sure that it finds its place you don't have to do that relax in that 1962 remember remembering the lord there has to be a creator if there is a creation and if there is a creation it was made by a creator and any man's work reflects himself if he's a good carpenter he does good work he builds and if he's a good mechanic he does good work your work only reflects you remember what i just said why is god going to do work to give a gift and it not work now he's not a good worker it's not going to be the case with god maybe you or me but not with god his work is you and me he's going to make sure it works right and god's creation reflects god and god made everything for a purpose and everything that serves the purpose of god's purpose when it does it has a resurrection if you serve god's purpose then you have a resurrection if you don't serve god's purpose guess what you don't have why is that because if you don't serve his purpose your name is scratched off the book if you do something that is not his purpose for your life you're adding to your name is scratched off the book you weren't in his thoughts no true believer that was in his thoughts an eternal being can be scratched off that book they're not going to find themselves in a place that they can't repent and get out of that look i don't belong here this is not working this is not right this ain't flowing don't think pulpit ministry when i'm saying that saints individual lives if you're seeking a job and it just ain't happening like you're wanting this job and it's not working and you can't get it no matter how hard you try i would say quit trying if you're trying to buy this here and you just can't get enough money for it it's not working i would say quit trying to buy it do you understand the principle do you understand what i'm after don't it can be carnal too we want to apply the spiritual to the spiritual position but it can be very carnal as well how many people are seeking after a career that's not their career how many people are seeking after material goods that's not their material goods how many people are seeking after an entertainment or something some type of hobby or something that's not flowing it's not working they're having to make it happen you all know me well enough to know that i have nothing against hard work i'm not saying you just said around oh whatever god have yep if it works it'll work you know i'll just sit here and if the bills need paid they'll get paid you understand you can go off on either side with fanaticism i'm saying be spiritual and pray about it and really discern really discern and be honest with yourself because at the end of the day you may fool me you may fool your brother and sister you may fool your family but at the end of the day can you look yourself in the eye in the mirror and say my heart is pure i'm not trying to make this happen i'm not trying to force it this is what god is doing or this is what god is not doing that's what matters at the end of the day is if you can answer that question it doesn't matter what i think or what anybody else is thinking if you can answer that question you're in the words of the book heavens and earth will pass away but that will not pass away let's go to ephesians 4. if you'll bear with me to go through this we'll put a bow on this and be done with it notice i did not put a time limit on that just kidding i remember it's wednesday night and there's people here that's worked ephesians 4 i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called i would say another word for vocation is purpose walk worthy of the purpose wherewith you're called notice how he then tells you to walk with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love how can he say that is because paul knows the principle that if you have a relevant if you have a revelation of the purpose or the vocation that you were called and you cannot proceed with lowliness and meekness chances are it's not your position and that's not your purpose because if i have a revelation that god has called me let's just use this because this is simple if i have a revelation that god has called me to stand here and to preach and i do what does it matter what anybody else's say says or does about that if he has called me what can you do to remove me from this position he said heavens and earth will pass away but that won't pass away that's good for you too whatever position capacity gift calling that you're in if it wasn't for that i would never stand here you would be foolish to stand here because i am going to be held accountable for every word that i say here and people's eternal destination is going to be based on that and i'm going to be judged on that why would anybody in their right mind say i'll go and do that the only real reason that somebody will do that there's two reasons somebody will do that number one they don't have a revelation of what we just discussed and they'll do it for pride and popularity or they have a revelation that that is their calling and their purpose and if they don't do that they're taking away from the words of the book so it's a catch-22 your foolishness you're foolish if you do it that's scriptural the foolishness of preaching it's scriptural i'm here to make a form out of myself i probably do a pretty good job of that but i would rather come here and be foolish and make a fool out of myself than have my name stretched off the book because when the revelation of your purpose comes a true revelation i'm not talking about a whim or something frivolous i'm talking about a true revelation and you don't do that you're not going to sleep at night you're going to need xanax you're going to need a house with the padded walls if you're a real true genuine seed of god the same way you say well how can you say that you don't know that yeah i can because the same way somebody would come and they would preach something different than what you know to be true and hear nervous do you get how unsettled do you start feeling how easy it is it to swallow it down you can't once you know the truth like if somebody was to come and tell you that the white horse rider was god himself going out and combating everything are you going to stand for that are you going to rest easy on that are you going to be able to swallow that down no because you know the truth it's undeniable it's already been revealed to you that's the antichrist spirit going forward it's that same confidence it's that same revelation that we have to have in our daily life and our calling and our purpose because if not we're going to find ourselves causing god trouble and our self trouble but once you do find that rest in that be comfortable in that that's why this is just me talking i don't know why i'm talking but that's why i'm su when i see a minister come to the pulpit and he's super nervous i get super nervous why is that because if he's super nervous now i'm not talking about butterflies you would be silly if you didn't have butterflies but i'm talking like nervous like they can't do nothing they're so nervous when i see that it makes me question the revelation of being there because you've got to have a revelation to come there brother branham said that i didn't say that he said you better meet god face to face the pillar of fire on the backside of the desert before you stand there you have to have that or you've got no business standing there so if they haven't got that revelation to the fact that they're so nervous they can't come here and they know this is my position and i can't make it happen i can't force this i cannot come here and break the word he has got to come and do it remember brother branham says the gift was to relax and let him do it that's why i can come to the pulpit and i'm not nervous not now don't get me wrong like i said we're not talking butterfly nervous we're talking nervous to the point i don't know what's going to happen i don't know if he's going to be there i don't know if this will work that would mean that i don't have a proper revelation as the prophet told me i needed to even stand here now let's quit talking about me because i don't like talking about me and let's talk about you it's not just a ministry a pulpit ministry that we're dealing with saints it's you can you go to work each and every day confident this is where he's placed me because if you can't do not expect any fruit from that if you cannot go there as thus saith the lord he has placed me here for a purpose for a reason for something how can there be fruit from that the scripture says that which is not done in faith is is sin you say well that's real simple that's real elementary i'm just trying to pay my bills that's fine i get that but god will take this little thing over here of a problem that you need to pay your bills and then create a position over here to allow you to pay your bills and still allow his spiritual kingdom to move forward and it will work and it will work and if you find yourself having to force the issue or if you find yourself grasping for a position that's just out of reach i would say check that i would say pray about that because if it's you trying to make it work or you trying to do it you're already off the mark and there cannot be fruit from that but if you have the revelation that he has called me and he has placed me here i don't care if you're making two dollars an hour or 500 an hour he's going to pay your bills and you're going to see fruit [Music] so we understand the the importance of ministry and the breaking of the word and the the position to stand here but remember that's the same importance is on your daily life this is just an example that we can talk about because it's easy to talk about and it's easy to show and we would all agree on that we wouldn't want somebody just to come here previously but why would we conduct our daily lives the words in the book with any less preeminence and importance paul says walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you were called with lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love i went off on a tangent i forgot what i was originally going to say the reason paul can say this that you can walk with loneliness and meekness is because if that's revealed to you you don't have to make it work and you don't have to worry about protecting it if god has placed you in that job why do you need to be worried about you getting fired if god has allowed you this capacity to pay your bills and these are not bills that you just went out and got because of ridiculous behavior and doing silly stuff you understand what i'm talking about if god god is he says i've not seen my righteous forsaken god is going to pay your bills and if he's created this position to allow you to do it why are you worried that he's going to take that position away from you there is no man in the world that can take that position away from you it's impossible now if you've put yourself there i would probably start putting your applications in somewhere else because it'll crumble i know that's really simple but if we will take that same principle and apply it carnally and spiritually the kingdom of god will grow and there will be fruit from it and we can move forward with faith not fear not worrying if it's going to work does that make sense [Music] so we don't have to worry about moving forward pridefully or forcefully we can move forward with lowliness and meekness because if i'm in this position and i'm not and i'm called to be in this position there's nobody can move me from it but if i'm in this position and somebody can remove me from it or some external force can remove me from it i say thank god i clearly wasn't supposed to be in that position whatever that position is i'm not talking about ministry and preaching now whatever that position is if you can be moved that means you probably weren't supposed to be there to begin with heavens and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away my words will not be moved now it doesn't ever mean that you can't switch jobs it doesn't ever mean that you might have to work some overtime to pay some bills you understand you can get fanatical with it but that's not what we're after we're after staying in the middle of the road we're after seeking god for revelation that's what we're after [Music] so that was ephesians 4 1 and 2. but i want to go you don't have to turn there you can just listen it's very familiar you'll know where we're going but i want to inject john 13 into this right here because it's applicable paul says walk worth worthy of the vocation where you wherein you are called with all loneliness and meekness now let's look at jesus now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hours was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end and supper being ended the devil having put into the heart of judah security simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and lay aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after that he poureth water into a base and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel with he was girded but unto every one of us i'm sorry that's verse seven in ephesians so we can see jesus i would say coming to the perfection of his ministry the seventh seal being revealed god on earth god in the form of flesh the same pattern that we're now walking in he came to a point a perfection in his ministry that he knew he came from god and he knew he was going to god and he did not have to force the issue because now he could come and he could wash his disciples feet and he didn't have to worry that somebody would say well that is god in flesh i thought he was the one supposed to be being worshipped i thought he was the one supposed to be getting his feet washed you know this i don't know if he's in that position i don't know if that's really him or not there was one man that thought that that's what brother branham said he says that's why judas betrayed him he says he just couldn't see him being the son of god because of his humility he would see him hungry he would see him thirsty he would see him bowing down to others to wash their feet he just couldn't think that that was the son of god the principle applies if we have i don't know of a greater revelation that you can have that you came from god and you're going to god i would venture to say that that would be perfect faith but if that revelation produces something other than lowliness and meekness and the ability to submit yourselves to your brothers and sisters i would venture to say you really don't have that revelation [Music] and i would venture to say that any complex that you would have that you would have to build up your calling or build up your ministry or build yourself up in any capacity to defend this position or this calling i would say that doesn't match the words in the book because jesus knowing that he came from god and knowing that he was going to god amen i'm going to take a towel and wash my disciples feet i'm not concerned about what people's going to say about my position he knew he came from god and he knew he was going to god why do why would he care what anybody else said or believed or thought or degraded why should we if we have that revelation now if you don't and you're trying to defend something i would be concerned but if you have that proper revelation and understand it's not that we conduct ourself in any way that we just want to and we don't care we're the bride paul says don't do anything that'll stumble your brother but i'm saying to rest in that why do we feel the need to defend or to fight or protect or to build up if this is my purpose in life and it is equivalent to the words in the book and heaven and earth that's going to pass away but this position is not going to this purpose is not going to this calling is not going to what is hybrid me going to do to defend it like if god can't defend it what am i going to do to defend it and furthermore why should i be defended picking back up in verse 11 of ephesians 4. or i'm sorry verse 7 but unto every one of us has given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ now to verse 11. and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some of angels and some pastors and some teachers you say you're talking about the ministry again that's five fold ministries pulpit ministries ministries and in the church behind the pulpit yes that's true but think about this for a second do you think for a second that evangelist is going to be um what's the word that i'm looking for that an evangelist is going to be is going to have good results if he doesn't even know who his pastor is like i'm storming the world saving souls for christ who's your pastor uh [Music] don't know get back to you on that that's like the infantryman going out to battle to save the world and he has no general orders or know who his captain is what's he going to do he's going to cause his captain and himself a lot of trouble okay i think you caught that it's just going to cause trouble he gave some of prophets evangelists pastors and teachers brother brennan says even a teacher he says you take a real good teacher he says he still has to have a pastor because he's on thin ice to begin with and he has to have a pastor to keep him on the straight and narrow because a teacher can get so wound up into the spirit and so wound up into the scriptures that he can start seeing things a lot of things some of them which don't exist but his principle will be true but brother branham says you can go to seed on some of those types and shadows and be wrong he says a true genuine teacher still has to set under a pastor to keep him in line same thing for an apostle or a prophet we know a word prophet is above all that but the five-fold ministry of you know a what we would term as a minor prophet under that brother bran says the pastor is the i'm going to get this wrong but he is the most powerful position at the local assembly the highest position we know god has ordained that he's purposed that any of these positions that would go around that i would question he says but what i want to get to here as well is that's just ministering but let's think for a second we would acknowledge the position of a pastor but a pastor will come here to the pulpit and what if he didn't have musicians to set an atmosphere how much fun would that be then i would have to come and sing a solo and a special and now nobody's going to hear a word that i said if you're even still here or the pastor or whoever else he can sing a solo if he wants to do you understand what i'm saying you say well god placed those there look at the positions under those that have to be there maybe it is his position to stand here and to preach and to govern their local body but what is supporting that what if those people just say well because i can't come and preach or because i'm not a pastor i'm just going to hang it up we would have a dirty church if we had a church we would have a poor atmosphere and the word would not go forth and be effective that's the word i was looking for a little while ago about the evangelist he wouldn't be effective it wouldn't work saints so when we read this scripture don't leave it behind the pulpit he gave gifts unto men but unto every one of us unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ and he gave some not all he gave some apostles prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers we're coming to a close i promise just stay with me musicians come now you know that i'm serious i've went slow for a purpose it would be really easy for me to get wound up and and preach this but i went slow for a purpose because i want you to catch what i'm saying even if i've said it 300 times like when you walk out of here you're not going to have an excuse you know what i've said and trust me it's not been easy like there's some of these things that i really want to preach on i might do a part three because i really want to preach them because it would be fun but i want you to hear what i'm saying when israel went out to battle not everybody went to battle you understand he gave some to go to battle when israel went to battle there was only a select group that went to battle but when they came back with the spoils guess who all got the spoils yes it really is that simple i would probably no i wouldn't i know my nature but i was going to say i would rather be working in the kitchen and let somebody else go through the fighting but i couldn't do that because that's not my nature but it would be a lot safer and it'd make a hot it would make a lot more sense but i guarantee you the potato pillar was not sad when they came back with all the spoils and he got to partake of them he was not sad that he didn't get to go out that day and take a knife into the side like he wasn't upset about that he was happy he was pilling potatoes because that's what his calling was that's what his purpose was but there were some that had to go to the battle you don't want a potato pillow pillar at the battle unless you don't want your nation to stand anymore and i know these are some laughable analogies but it's just as laughable when one member of the body of christ tries to take another member position or if they get out of position it's just as laughable like you may not be able to see it but everybody else can and it's laughable the same as it would be the mr potato pillar out there trying to fend off the philistines it's not going to last not very long it's not going to work and furthermore if i'm the other potato pillar and i'm not getting any spoils to pay my bills because this guy got out of position and went to the battle and lost i'm not going to be happy so now it's detrimental to everybody else too he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers and he gave others positions under those to make sure they work those positions are not going to work without me and you underneath of them how much fun would it be to stand here and preach and nobody say amen nobody to pull on the word i wouldn't be able to preach if nobody pulled on the word been there done that never do it again i'll read through my notes and i'll close the service i can't preach unless somebody pulls like i can't make this work i've stood here for an hour and 20 minutes now praise the lord i would have been here literally for 15 minutes if somebody was not pulling on the word you can't make it work like you can't fake it you just can't it either works or it don't work and it's real obvious when it works and when it don't work because it's if a man gets behind it and it's forcing it it's just uncomfortable that's good on the small picture that's good on the big picture verse 12 for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ if your position your calling what god has revealed to you is not working towards the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of christ i would be real concerned about what you're doing or what you're not doing till we all come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god and to a perfect man into the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro see children just do whatever they want if you don't believe that come to my house they don't they don't have a purpose they don't have a clear line of thought it's just whatever comes toys whatever play fish it's just whatever comes along that's what i want you understand what i'm saying but when you come to a level of maturity you get up and your day is maybe scheduled like there are certain things you have to do there's certain roles you have to fulfill if you want to keep moving forward in society and not in an evil way i'm not saying like climb the ladder or moving forward i'm just saying if you want to have a roof over your head and food to eat there's certain things if you want to feed your children who don't care what they're doing and just want to play and fish there are certain things that have to be done paul says don't be like little children be focused that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lay in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may great grow up unto him and through all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joint together and compacted by that which every joy supplyeth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part maketh increase of the body and to the edifying of itself in love this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth this is the part that i want to lay emphasis on that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind paul is saying do not have a spiritual religious life that is equivalent to that which other gentiles have that ye walk not as other gentiles walk so if we don't want to walk as other gentiles walk we probably should ascertain how they walk and make sure we're not doing that so how do other gentiles walk if they have an inkling of a spiritual desire or a religious desire they go and they find a church that they agree with the doctrine and they join it and they go there wednesday and sunday maybe and they say i'm a member of this and this is what i believe don't leave that out there paul says don't walk as other gentiles walk find a doctrine that i believe in a church i can fellowship in one that my lifestyle will fit you understand what i'm saying paul says don't walk as other gentiles walk as other religious gentiles walk i would say as church goers walk gentiles don't do that don't just go find whatever doctrine you can agree with it's good you should agree with your doctrine don't just go ever find whatever church that you can have a good fellowship with that's good you should have that i would say there's a problem if you don't but paul is saying just don't have a church life that's what other gentiles do they find something they can agree with they find something that they're comfortable with they find the youth group that their children fit in they find whatever you understand paul says do not let your spiritual walk be that way this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye hints forth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind in the vanity of their mind their mind not the mind of christ that's the problem don't think for a second that you can't sit in a message church with the true doctrine that you believe in a group of a group of brothers and sisters that you love and can fellowship with don't think you can't set in that type of environment and still be walking as another gentile because if you're doing it of your mind you're walking just the same as another gentile the vanity of their mind verse 18 though having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart this is why the seals had to be loosed because if the seals weren't loosed we would just be walking as other gentiles walked but now the seals have been loosed and the mind of god has been revealed and the life of god has been revealed so now we can walk differently from other gentiles that was the purpose of the seal being loosed because of this scripture here paul says don't walk that way anymore having their understanding darkened our understanding is not in darkness we are walking in the light being alienated from the life of god we are not alienated from the life of god the words that i speak to you they are spirit and they are life the ignorance that is in them we do not walk in ignorance anymore the full word has come christ himself has descended there is no more excuse for ignorance because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over into lasciviousness that just means lust their own desires their own mind to work all uncleanness with greediness that is the direct result of walking as other gentiles you will end up in a condition of uncleanness and greediness and greediness is not just meaning you want money it may just mean that you want a position that's not yours or you don't want a position that is yours or you don't want to be a position under a position because you want to be the main position or you don't want to be the potato pillar because you want to go and fight or maybe you got stabbed three days in a row so you're tired of fighting you want to go be the potato pillar greediness greediness is simple simply self-desire i want it can be i want money i want popularity i want women i want security i want safety i don't want my feelings hurt i want a stable job it can be any of that it can be whatever you want and paul says do not walk that way anymore walk unalienated from the life of god walk with his word walk with the purpose of your life if you just play something softly please because if you'll do that you won't find yourself in a position of uncleanness and you will not find yourself in a position of greediness wanting more of something that's not even yours to begin with or not walking in something that is yours because you're fearful of the repercussions of that but if we will walk unlike other gentiles that's how we're to walk and we should walk that way because we have not alienated ourselves from the life of god which is his word that is the form that the life of god has came in in our day and age [Music] remember when jonah left the scripture says jonah got up and left the presence of the lord and then it says that again he went and he got a ship and he went from the presence of the lord if you'll read the scriptures before that it says the word of the lord came to jonah so if the word of the lord came to jonah but jonah left the presence of the lord what does that make the word of the lord [Music] brother brahm says we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest don't annihilate yourself don't that's not the word that i was trying to use don't and an alienate yourself from the word made manifest because it's the only thing that can give you life it's the only thing that can give you the proper understanding if you'll stand with me this evening it's the only thing that can make sure that you are fulfilling your purpose and not somebody else's purpose it is the only thing that can keep you in the straight and narrow it's the only thing that can make a difference between you and any other church member out there is the revealed word of god both in written form and in your daily life you have to have both you can have the proper understanding of the doctrines but if it is not manifested in your life you're still just walking as another gentile and paul says don't do that don't cut yourself off from the life don't cut yourself off don't be ignorant seek him seek the will of the lord for your life and i said this last service but i just want to say it again because it really sums up everything that i've taken really too long to say if the purpose of god saving each individual really is equivalent revelation 22 18 the words in the book and that is the living word we would agree with that that is the living word we have to seek god with the same desperation for the purpose of our life that we do for the true interpretation of the written word [Music] with as much fervency as we sought him for truth of the written word we have to seek him with that same level of fervency for the real true revelation interpretation of our daily lives the living word [Music] because that is his final reality and when i say that i'm not saying that this hybrid condition is his final reality his final reality is himself in flesh we know this carcass is going to drop away the atoms will change but we're still brother brandon says it's the same element you're made up of that's going to be your glorified body [Music] there's going to be a dna change hybrid and hybridization is going to fall away but the same 16 elements are the same 16 elements that your glorified body is going to have [Music] we have to seek him with that same fervency for the purpose of our individual lives as we do for the interpretation of the written word i would venture to say that there is nobody in here that would be comfortable going back on any of the doctrines that brother branham has preached how many wants to go back to eve eaten an apple we know what happened in the garden how many wants to go back to eve eating an apple and it's suddenly making her realize she's naked and the snakes in the tree talking to her how many wants to go back to not even know no comprehension of why it has to be a blood sacrifice these are elementary things but there there were people maybe maybe not this younger generation because we had things handed to us that the other generation before us had but there was a generation in here that that was new to them that was new to them and they had to seek god desperately is this you is this truth because it's unlike anything that i've ever heard and if it's truth i've got to walk in it there was a desperation there now we know that those doctrines and teachings and revelations have continued to come and there has been a group of people that had sought and seeked sought god fervently whether this be true or not we can't now come to the climax of that and the purpose of that and say oh yeah well my daddy told me it was this so it's that you know that yeah you know my grandma believed that that's what it is no fervency brother rhema says that was the mistake that first church aide made was they failed to keep reaching out in the spirit we have proper doctrine we have proper teaching but the perfection is when it comes into human beings the purpose of our daily lives [Music] brother branham says when he watched that bride going out i told you i would get back to this when he saw the preview of the bride and they were going out it says they came the first time just perfect the worldly church came up running running around rock and roll music he says but then the bride came again and just as they was going out of sight a couple of them started getting off in line and he says they were watching that worldly church that was going off into chaos [Music] what happened in genesis 1 1 there was a world being restored after chaos what happened in the garden of eden chaos from leaving the word what happens at the end time what's the distraction to the true church is the false church leaving the word and going into chaos they left the purpose of their life they left the purpose the words in the book they left that purpose and it led into chaos the pattern will never change it will not it never changed for eve and never changed for the world before that and never changed for anybody it's not going to change for me and you if we don't seek him desperately for the truth of our individual lives we're going to end up in chaos and when one goes into chaos it's going to affect the other just like brother random says the stars does let's pray together lord jesus we just want to thank you for this time of fellowship that you've given us lord lord i've been lengthy it seems like it happens every time lord of just way longer than i intended to be but father i know what you were trying to say here this evening and i've repeated it every way that i know how without just being a complete fool lord i know what you are trying to get to us father and i pray for myself and for every individual here that we can come seeking you lord you have sought us but now that you have sought us you have brought us out of the maori clay you were looking for a reciprocal seeking even so much that you would say in your scriptures that when you would seek me with all of your heart then you would find me lord and we're coming down to the very closing moments of time where every jaw and every tittle has to be lined up just so perfectly and we have no capability to do that within ourselves father father you have truly come and restored completely your written word but i pray that we would seek you now with fervency that you would come and restore every jaw and every tittle of your living word that we would not be distracted by anything going off into chaos but we would walk truly and solely in the perfect revelation of the calling and the purpose of our each and every one individual lives that we would find ourselves with the life of god flowing through us and that we would not deviate away from your word and that your word your living word would fulfill that what you said in matthew the heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away my bride will not pass away the purpose that i had in saving these individuals it will not pass away it will not fail it will not go into chaos i've predestinated it not to father may we yield to that may we submit ourselves to that may we fervently seek that and not be distracted by this world i pray that you would bless the people here this evening lord again i've been way leftier than i intended to be and there's there's people here that's worked father lord i pray that you would just be their portion that you would restore that to the lord that you would give them a good night's rest and that you would anoint them for their work tomorrow lord give them strength give them virtue lord we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you sir [Music] gonna rise higher every day god's only god one way to go [Music] spread my wings today i know the winds of him helped me fly away so high [Music] spread your wings and clouds [Music] god's your guide [Music] the end is [Music] just [Music] higher every day god's only god one way you go through [Music] [Music] know the winds of faith [Music] amen how many want to find your position and man god will lead you just stay true to him i'd say i'd say many times i've talked to people who wanted to know what's my position i don't know what i'm supposed to do in the body and it's obvious to me they're already doing it because it comes natural and it comes so natural they don't realize that they're already in encourager they're already hosting people putting people together they're already doing the thing that they do best and they're already serving the body they don't even realize it i mean what it takes more than anything is a consecrated desire to be in the will of god and to give him preeminence amen brother brennan made it made a statement i was reading in the seals that made it so interesting you know brother is coming to the beginning of the second seal in the beginning of the third seal and right from the beginning he says lord he's praying lord reveal this to us it's coming to the seals lord reveal this to us that we'll know how you want us to act in this day and that we might be better christians so what was the revelation and the seal supposed to do make us better christians amen open our eyes so we understand god's plan and understand what the antichrist spirit is doing and just surrender ourselves to god and god can make us better at what he called us to do by revealing the word to us and one thing i wrote down what brother ben was preaching is we know the second fold purpose of god's threefold plan was to have preeminence in a body but i wrote this little statement three minutes must be given before it is taken god is a gentleman he doesn't come in by force and just take but you must give him the preeminence before he takes the preeminence and in this day i think that's the greatest call i think that's the heart of what brother ben was telling us is surrender to god make make your calling an election primary in life the main focus the main point make it important make be sincere about it and yield ourselves to god and let god use us for whatever he wants to use us for we may not always clearly understand what we're doing but as long as we're in his hand and he's using us and doing it through us it's going to work and it's going to work well i think the main focus my main goal for me the thing that god's been dealing with me on lately is to stay consecrated not be distracted but stay consecrated so that he can use me man god bless you and we sure enjoyed being with you tonight may god take the word may it be manifest what we've heard may it come into a manifestation in our lives that's my desire this is bow our heads and pray lord we thank you we want to thank you lord for the word that you've given us for the focus and attention you've drawn our attention lord and god i don't believe there's one of us who desires to be in the wrong place but with all our hearts we desire lord to find that place and to operate in that place you purposed for us for we believe you saved us for a purpose and god if we can just be true to you and surrendered and humble we know that you'll do things that we never thought of lord things we haven't yet imagined things that we couldn't comprehend so god has a body may we just take this time to surrender to you afresh may we lord just see ourselves placed in your hands and may we not inject our own thinking into the program or our own ideas our own wishes our own wants but god i pray that you would help me just to lay myself in your hand and say god whatever you want from me is what i want you to have what you want me to do where you want me to go what you want me to say or not say lord i want you to have preeminence in me god forgive me for my distractions forgive me for my own ideas forgive me for taking my own mind so many times but god after hearing this word more than anything lord i just want to do your will i want to be in your hand i want you to be in control i want to be surrendered to you god as we come to the final moments of time may you have absolute preeminence in us lord god we don't want to have our own part to play nor we just want to surrender everything to you may you give us a peace and a confidence and a rest that we're in your hand and we've surrendered to you we've given it all to you and that you're going to do what you've purposed to do from before the foundation of the world god you've opened the seals to us to show us how to be better christians now help us to go and manifest that better christian life god take control of our homes of our families of our workplaces just take control of us as we yield to you we ask that you bless us as we go bless brother ben and restore to him all that he gave out and god may you use him for your purpose may you use us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless your friends remember john it's time [Music] god's word has come promise he has made it's perfect faith the way [Music] the bride we're rising every day [Music] [Music] revelation day by day the word has been made so bright just right [Music] [Music] god's only god one way

come into your presence [Music] past the gates of grace [Music] as i look upon your countenance i see the fullness of your prayers and i can only bow down and say you are awesome in this place you are
