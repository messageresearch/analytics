which you put us here we ask your blessing over the word this evening in jesus christ's name we pray amen and while you're standing if you could turn with me to saint john the gospel of john chapter one we'll be getting ready reading from there i'd like to continue on with the same thought from sunday the seven seals opened the entire bible so this will be part two and uh uh there's a lot this keeps opening up and opening up and um so i don't know that we'll get it finished today but we'll just keep moving as we can also i wanted to announce that next wednesday a week from today uh brother samuel vollek will be here from poland brother samuel's brother yatzik's son so if you remember a couple years ago brother yatzik was here from poland and i've been out there to minister before and brother samuel is his son he's a minister in the church and he was my interpreter for the services there so we're looking forward to having him so be praying for that he'll be here next wednesday amen let's look at john chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not let's skip over to verse 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not let's go to verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen may the lord add us blessing to the word as we're seated we could bring up the powerpoint and we'll get started right away in that when we look at this saint john we went through this scripture sunday in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen as we go on these these scriptures keep meaning more and more and more to me as we look at this and god continues to unveil this and and we know that he was in the beginning with god and he was in the world verse 10 and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came as a light and the world comprehended not who came because he came as the word and then that word was made flesh and dwelt among us so i want to look at that a little bit this evening in the quote souls lord in prison now this is a repeat from sunday but it says john looked around and he wept because there was no man even worthy to look on the book and especially to open the seals to reveal what the hidden mystery was the mysteries was in the seven seals when the seven seals was open that opened up the entire bible the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and in those seven seals was held the entire mystery of it now this is interesting and this is where we got our text for sunday and for this the series that we're preaching when the seven seals was open that opened up the entire bible and what's interesting is that the opening of the seven seals when we look at the details of the opening of the seven seals when we had the interpretation of the symbols you we found out what a white horse rider was and what a red horse rider was and a black horse rider pale horse and souls under the altar in the sixth dimension or uh in the sixth seal i'm sorry and all of those things but but when he says when the seven seals was open that opened up the entire bible amen it didn't just reveal just the interpretation of the symbols but there was something else that was laying under all of that that it revealed and it revealed for us that christ was the entire bible he was all of it amen it was all christ and that's what we went into great detail sunday on and we'll look at this again but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets this is brother branham's ministry he's the seventh angel and he's here to finish the mystery of god and to reveal the mystery of god and so we know that he comes in july of 1963 and he preaches christ as the mystery of god revealed he said now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire bible now remember this when those seven seals opened it opened up the entire bible and now brother branham wants to take the text and base it on the entire bible so the seals open the entire bible amen now he wants to take a text basing it on the entire bible but i want us to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god revealed so in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god should be finished he comes and preaches a message called christ is the mystery of god revealed and he bases it upon the entire entire bible telling us that the opening of those seals opened up or unlocked the entire bible that's why brother branham after he preaches the seals he says my bible has become a new book it's a brand new book because there was something he says there was a mystery amen laying underneath of that a secret that was laying through the whole bible amen and that's what we're wanting to get to in christ is the mystery of god he says he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god said well you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it so what i want to what i want to stop and say so far these are all reviewed there's nothing new here this is review from sunday but when he says the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is expressing one goal all of a sudden our thinking completely changes now because we've been reading the bible but we haven't been seeing the bible because we've been reading the bible and reading stories and histories i'm not talking about us in the message but denominationally for generations we've been reading the bible and reading old testament and we're reading the book of isaiah and this is isaiah or this is has a this is ezekiel or this is uh genesis this is the story of them coming out of egypt it was the story of egypt it was the story of moses it was the story of noah and it was all these stories that were disjointed but laying there in the bible and we believed that they were all true but brother branham after he preaches the seals he says these are not individual stories or a collection of historical stories amen this is one story one goal one revelation one thing that god wanted to achieve and it changed our complete completely changed our thinking about the bible and completely changed our understanding of the scriptures now amen brother benham said makes the statement if you read the bible and don't see christ in every verse go back and read it again for you missed something because now the whole bible is about christ and christ is the revelation of god so the whole bible is the invisible god becoming known through the bible so it was god becoming known in noah god becoming known amen and abraham god becoming it was the thought of god that god had thought before the foundation of the world of how he was going to express himself and that thought amen was a word and that word moved into a manifestation and as that word was manifesting it wasn't a story about abraham it was about god it was christ the manifested a revealed word revealing god and so it really begins to change the bible from 66 books to one book from old and new testament to one story one goal one thing that he wanted to achieve and and what was that one thing he wanted to achieve to be known to be made manifest to be declared now in the message it is the rising of the sun says he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ so we talked about this if you remember i i showed the the picture of the cloud amen as it was there in arizona in 1963 because brother benham told us that he shows it in the heavens above before he declares in the heavens before he does it on earth and what did he declare what he declared was the sign the sign showed what he was going to do what was the sign the sign was the headship coming down it was christ it was the head it was the full understanding or the full revelation or the full knowledge of god was coming down to unite with a body it was the revelation of jesus christ so that's what that's what was coming what what is the opening of those seals revealing christ still reviewing he says god's word comes only by the bible god's bible is the printed form of the son of god because the bible said that is the revelation of jesus christ it's god revealing himself through christ and christ is the word we can look back at the bible we look back at the old testament and when when the jews i i don't presume to understand what the jews understood when they wrote the bible 2000 when they read it 2000 years ago but they were reading you know in synagogue and reading coming up and being told of the story of the life of joseph and joseph was a hero to them in the former days one of the patriarchs that who saved you know a great part of the world and saved the the nation of israel but the story wasn't about joseph that story was about christ and it was about christ being rejected from his brethren amen being cast away i mean going to the prison house amen and bearing amen the iniquity of his uh the rejection and iniquity of his brothers and coming forth and raising rising to the right hand of power amen so that he can save all of his brethren that's what that story is about so when jesus christ came in the fulfillment of the story of joseph now he's coming and they're playing out exactly what they've been reading for thousands of years and they're rejecting their brother and they're casting him away amen so that he can raise up to the the the hand of right hand of power so that he can save them and they don't even know what their bible's about they know the bible baby like i said we've been reading the bible but we haven't been seeing the bible amen we read the story of joseph but we didn't see the story of joseph because the story of joseph was foreshadowing the ministry of jesus christ hopefully we'll come back to that amen who is this melchizedek notice now his attribute then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us saint john the first chapter the first verse notice in the beginning but before the eternal notice the beginning was the word when the time began it was the word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word so he's showing us the the the i with the revealing of god first it was attribute it was thought then the thought when it come expressed was a word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he says again who is this melchizedek now god in this stage it's this stage of his creation sorry this stage of his creation later formed into flesh jesus from what from the great beginning spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it just spoke out and morphe later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to taste death for all of us sinners amen i'm going to oh i'm going to read this next scripture and then i want to go to the white board hebrews 1 god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he hath pointed air of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high so i'm going to try to draw this like i did the other day we talked about the thought remember brother branham said god dwelt alone with his thoughts he said he wasn't even god yet because god is an object of worship and there was nothing yet no thought yet had been expressed i mean there was nothing there to worship him and then there was an expression and then there was a manifestation and we used the example sunday of when god thought in in the creation of the earth or the recreation in genesis 1 2 he thought uh let there be light that was his thought amen but when he spoke let there be light that was this expression of the thought but then when the light appeared it was the manifestation of the thought a manifestation of the word which was a manifestation of the thought so there's a line of connection from the thought of god all the way to the manifestation now if god said let there be light and something else had manifest it wasn't his thought it wasn't the word something messed up in between but we know that help me lord to draw we got our little thought box here but then that thought of god brother brenham said then then out from the father came the son came the logos amen and he called it a pillar of fire or a light amen there was an expression there was something from god that came into an expression and and we'll just draw a pillar of fire i don't know if that's a pillar of fire but a light he said a little light came out and that was the logos and that was the sun what was it it was something that came from the father it was now god's thoughts now coming into an expression and he called that sign and that was the full thought of god that was the word logos means the word with the thought but then that thought was formed into a man right and that full word that full thought of god was formed into a man jesus christ the son of god amen and that had he was the expression of the full thought of god that had expressed as a word and that word come into manifestation so he was the perfect reflection of the thought of god of the invisible god when you wanted to see god you had to look at this expression and that expression was perfectly reflecting god making him god in flesh he was god in flesh because he was the thought perfectly expressed there was no perversion there was no corruption it was the perfect expression of the it was a perfect manifestation of the perfect word from the perfect thought making it equal to god but it was son that son was not father father was the thought what came out of the father was the son the son couldn't be the father right so we know this is not pentecostal oneness amen brother ben didn't teach us pentecostal oneness and the godhead but the father was the thought the originator originating everything and the expression that came forth from that that came out of him was a son that son was reflecting the the father the life of the father and it came into manifestation and when it came into manifestation amen he was perfectly reflecting the father he was the expressed image of the invisible god making him the manifestation of god so so let's just oh man let's just do this if you and i were part of that thinking of god from the beginning when god was thinking of manifesting himself he he already thought out the entire bible before he wrote before he had one prophet write one word he had thought out the entire bible and if you find yourself as an expression of that bible you have a part in that then you had a part in god you were in his thinking so so if you're here today amen and you believe that you that that you are part of god that you were in his thinking that you're here to manifest and express a thought god had of you before the foundation of the world that means you were here right there and when out when all the thoughts come into expression you were also here in the logos and if that's true then when that was moved in the flesh you were here too that's why brother branham said we don't have to die for us since he already made me die before my sins when i was with him at calvary amen we why because all of this moved into an expression all of that expression moved into a manifestation in flesh so if you were there you moved into the logos amen you have no conscious knowledge of that it wasn't you like you're standing here today but it was that part of god that wanted to express in you was in there moved into the logos you were there moved into the body of jesus christ was formed into flesh you were there so so what does that make the believer amen what does that make the believer amen you can't say i'm god like jesus and god were the same thing because it's a different portion it's a different volume he was the fullness you're a speck right but i'm happy to be a speck because a thought of god amen that was part of the logos is eternal amen that moved into a manifestation of flesh is eternal it's part of god it's an expression of god it's part of christ see these are some of the things that unlocked under the seals when our bible became a new book and we realized that the whole bible was christ it was christ and moses it was christ and noah it was christ and abraham why were they reflecting they were reflecting the thought of god expressing out in flesh being part of christ so when christ died on calvary he died for them but he also died for me because i'm another one of those thoughts to be expressed all right so when when this logos or word or thought it was here and out of that if we could just write down a timeline here of the old testament in every character in this old testament was noah or abraham moses joshua joseph whatever it was it was expressing part of that thought part of that was being expressed what was what was in here what was in here was now being expressed through here and coming into a manifestation through here but all of this was going to be wound up in the man on calvary all the fullness of the word was going to come into an expression amen that expression would be all the word that was bottled up old testament and new testament was there in calvary so brother is going to say i drew that picture because i want to see some things that brother brenham says as we go along here so he says that he who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person that's why when when when jesus claims that god is his father then they know that he's claiming to be the son of god they take up stones to stone him because he he being a son of god makes himself equal to god well if you're a son or daughter of god where did you come from you didn't just decide to be a son or daughter of god you had to have an origin in the father as a thought and when that origin when that moved into logos you were there amen when it was here in flesh and jesus christ you were there and now that portion that was allotted for this time is in you amen expressing out now you're an expressed manifested son or daughter of god what does that make you amen it makes you part of god that's why i believe if the world ever really understood what we were saying they would take up stones to stone us if they really comprehended what we believed amen and what we were really saying because we literally believe that there is something that's inside of me now amen that's in my soul that was in god before the foundation of the world that was part of the father that he wanted to express and he was going to express it in this day as a son amen now in colossians chapter 1 verse 13 he says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through the blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible listen just stop reading for a minute when i was a little boy amen when i was a little boy and i would read this scripture i envision jesus of nazareth standing there making everything in heaven and everything on earth do you understand what i'm saying as a little boy raising a denomination the only understanding i had of christ or the word or the logos was jesus of nazareth because that was the expression it was all in jesus of nazareth amen but before that body that flesh body was formed amen he was the logos amen he was the word and god made everything by the word by his word he made everything so by the sun he made everything in that sun moved in the flesh when he moved in the flesh he got the name of jesus amen and he was jesus christ but he was always christ so visible and invisible whether there be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist so the word came first and everything came from the word amen that's why for us the word is everything and the restoration back to the word is everything the the word being restored the word being restored to us is not for correct doctrine although it brings correct doctrine but the restoration of the word brings us back to the origin amen he is the word all things were made by the word all by the word all things consist so what did he fall from the word what's she being restored back to the word amen so i want to look at this verse 15 that's in orange here who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature and i'd like to read that out of the emphatic diagram he said he is a likeness of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation so the the king james is the firstborn of every creature but really you could read it the firstborn the firstborn of all creation because the first thing to come forth from the father was the son was the logos and out of him came everything that's made in heaven and in earth all right let's keep going if anybody misinterprets christ jesus christ in the bible of not being god himself making him the second person or one god out of three this would upset every word in the entire bible it would break the first commandment and this is uh this is he's preaching against the trinity doctrine he's teaching the correct understanding it would break the first commandment thou shall not have any other gods before me all right it would make the whole christian race a bunch of pagan worshipers worshiping three different gods see what kind of a bible you'd have then it'd make us what did you say we are which one of them gods is your god see so you see you can't you mustn't misinterpret the bible jesus jesus himself is the interpretation of the bible when he's made manifest listen to this and when he's made manifest in the age that that part of his body is being made manifest if you want christ find where his manifested word where the manifested word is and you'll find christ jesus himself is the interpretation of the bible when he's made manifest in the age that that part of his body is being made manifest we go to john first john 1 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sins this is a conditional statement if we walk in the light as he is in the light we know that he is the light and that light is the life of men so if we walk in the light as he is in the light because we must find where that portion of the word is made manifest for this age and that is christ and that is light and if we walk in that light and then the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin i want to back up and look at this for just a minute i just want to make one comment if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sins the blood of jesus christ is the price of redemption that erases all sin and it was the price that paid for abraham for moses for noah for joseph or joshua and erased all their sin so how when they didn't even know how to confess the blood and believe in calvary did they get the benefit of calvary amen they walked in the light as he was in the light so abraham was walking in the word for his day noah was walking in the word for his day which was the light moses was walking in the word for his day which was the light now that that was a portion of the word a portion of the word a portion of the word shows the same portion of the word that was in moses day being expressed was in jesus christ the same portion of the word that was in noah being expressed in noah's day was in jesus christ so the portion that they were believing and receiving was christ for their day now when christ was expressed in fullness now the word that they believed was the same word that bled for them that died for them he was the bleeding word amen so what did they believe in they believed in the word and that word atoned for them at calvary so you must walk in the light as he is in the light now christ is revealed in his own word god is revealed in every age by his promised word to that age all right the entire bible is the entire revelation of jesus christ making himself known to every age that's the whole bible what is the old testament jesus christ making himself known to that age what are the kings jesus christ making himself known to that age what it's the entire bible is jesus christ which is what the manifestation of the revelation of god and christ is the word the anointed word made manifest now this is important because the opening of the seals open up the entire bible what is the bible the bible is christ all right christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now notice that through the types we could take even david as spoke of a while ago going off his throne rejected by his own people going up the same mountain mount of olives as he he's going over to his prison he was going to his prison house because he was rejected of his brethren and of his own people he went up weeping that was the spirit of christ in him to be rejected as he looked over the jerusalem and wept said oh jerusalem how oft would i a rejected king 800 years later the son of david stood on jerusalem up there above jerusalem and rejected and wept over jerusalem and said now your hour has come that's right see all those things typed him just in time but yet the mystery was hid then men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do some now holding it back in the la in the last days for the great revelation but expressing it expressing himself in moses and david and joseph and elijah and on down through we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show it expressed jesus christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret and full waiting for to make it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended he was waiting for not to be in portion and portion and portion but he was waiting to wrap all the portion up together to let the word be fully comprehended then he would take the veil off of the whole thing and let us go back and see it was christ there christ here christ here christ here and it all matched waiting for to make known in the last days the promise waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it if he told the whole thing because the bible is written in mysteries jesus thanked the father for it and it was written in mysteries that it was written in mysteries in the unveiling of god he said oh brother sister are you catching it look don't you see it's been veiled through these ages according to what god said and it will be opened in the last days those seven seals would be broke and the full thing would come into view of the people what took place all along the hour of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god should be made known in that elijah this last hour how that christ was put out of his church the son of god how he's revealed a son of man again how that the church is to be put in order and everything for the last day no creed no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual i'll take one and leave one i'll take this and leave that one see there's no strings no denominations no bindings or nothing it's the heart with god in him alone notice veiled in human flesh moses with that word speaking what was to be later put behind badger skins so so is christ our moses christ is our moses he was god veiled in human flesh veiled in humanity in flesh that's right and he's the same yesterday today and forever you catch that god was veiled in human flesh and he's the same yesterday today and forever don't forget that he was veiled by badger skins he was veiled in this time he was veiled in a man see now notice same yesterday today and forever promised his word to this age he is still christ the promised word to this age veiled in human flesh the word is god now brother branham was standing there just like john the baptist was standing the day that he was the forerunner to the first coming of jesus christ and he was standing there and they asked him are you him and he says no i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness what did he say i am the manifestation of the word and when he said i am the manifestation of the word he was an expression of christ pointing to the expression of christ and here's brother branham fulfilling malachi 4 revelations uh 17 30. he's feeling he's fulfilling all of these scriptures and he's he's standing here amen and what was he amen he was malachi 4 he was revelations 10 7 he was all of these scriptures what was he he was christ veiled in flesh and he said in the word in this age he's still christ the promised word to this age veiled in human flesh the word is god the anointing is a person the word christ means anointed one the anointed one then moses was christ in his days so who was christ who was moses christ is that true who was noah christ who was brother branham christ now don't make a mistake i'm we're not saying he was the full expression of jesus christ but he was a portion moses wasn't the full expression of christ he was a portion jesus christ was the full expression of christ the word right and so it was still christ but christ in a portion one portion of christ be made manifest in that day one portion of christ be made manifest in this day until it come down to jesus christ himself was all portions made manifest in his day but christ is the revelation of god he's the word the anointed word for that age that's christ moses was christ in his days he was the anointed one jeremiah was christ in his days with a portion of the word for that day but when jesus come he come as the redeemer anointed one and that was both moses and all that was in moses and all the word and all the godhead bodily was in him that's the reason the whole temple veil ran and the mercy seat come in perfect view he was the anointed one notice now the veil in human flesh the promised word to this age must also be veiled notice sin-loving church members and sinners cannot see it because of the human veil so the revelation at the end time the revelation at the end of the church ages must also be veiled and it's veiled in human flesh we saw that in the prophet of god but it didn't stop with the prophet of god in the unveiling of god he says notice notice the title the unveiling of god notice then we then we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him you are part of him as long as christ is in you as christ was of god because god was in him made him god and as christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of christ he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he also see you become part of christ as long as christ is hid in you then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he's in you you are templing christ that's behind the veil the skin we be behind because of this veil the veil again in human flesh hides god the word from the unbeliever that's the day that we're living in now that's the manifestation in his bride christ is in his bride the word amen is in his bride behind the veil of flesh and the veil is hiding him from the unbeliever but you the believer you know he's there you know you're behind the veil with him and what is it you're templing christ amen that's why the the the revelation of the seven seals took the veil off of this and we begin to understand who christ is and how christ is manifest and we don't put it somewhere far off back amen but christ is here today christ is here moving amen christ is here manifesting the word is being made manifest in this day but it's in another veil it's hid behind skins behind the veil hiding him from the unbeliever amen but you know he's there you're temple in christ amen that makes the opening of the seals the peeling back of the mystery it makes it more than just details and interpretations it makes it a living reality in our day it makes it a living christ manifesting himself in another form he goes on you're tempting christ don't read this again you're tempting christ that's behind the veil of the skin behind because of this veil the veil again in human flesh hides god the word from the unbeliever that is writ as it is written written you are written epistles the bible said what is epistle is a written word and you are the written word other words you read it like this it says you are written epistles or you are the word that has been written made manifest nothing can be added to it message paradox he says god condescending from pillar of fire down to be made man and then the holy spirit right in us don't you see what it is the same god coming down all the time i want you to let's read that statement again carefully god condescending who's condescending god from pillar fire down to be made man that's in jesus christ and then the holy spirit right in us don't you see what it is the same god coming down all the time what is god manifest in flesh it's god coming down it's god condescending god above us god with us god in us see like the thought of god the word of god and the manifestation of the word he goes in those three orders again the thought of god the word of god and the manifestation of the word that's what we've been called to be in this day the message who is this melchizedek he says now in the beginning god dwelt alone with his attributes as i spoke this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just god alone but he had thoughts just like a great architect can set down in his mind and draw out what he thinks he's going to build create now he cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it a different form because god is the only is the only only one can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desires now it's a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word then a thought when it's expressed is a word a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's god's attributes then it becomes a thought then a word notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there was ever an angel star cherubim or anything else that's eternal and if you have eternal life you always was i say that quote applies to me by faith does it apply to you now now let's keep going now notice how few recognize him to be the anointed word of the day see god in the beginning being infinite and knowing all things from the beginning and the only thing that these things are is the display of his attributes and you have an attribute it's your thought you think of something then you speak it then you take it that's god that's the same way god manifest himself he thought then he spoke and then he manifested that's god he in the beginning if you ever was or ever will be in heaven you was in heaven to start with i love that statement if you ever was or ever will be in heaven you was in heaven to start with so there's no way for the believer to say i hope i make it to heaven there is no hope about it friends if you started there you're going back there amen you had to begin there to have a guarantee to go back there so then why did you come down amen if you started there's this thought why is god's thought in you now even you're here to be a manifested thought and expressed thought of god to manifest the whatever god thought he wanted to portray on the earth in your vessel in this day was in his thinking before the foundation of the world and you're here to do that you were here to express whatever that was you wanted to express and when you expressed that that is christ that is christ being expressed in your neighborhood that is christ being expressed in your workplace that is christ being expressed in your family that is christ being expressed that thought of god coming down into manifestation and manifesting itself out through a vessel is a manifestation of christ that's what we come here for if you ever was ever ever will be in heaven you was in heaven to start with you're part of god you were his thought he knew your name he knew who you were before there was ever a molecule before there was a light before there was anything he knew you and your name and put it on the lamb's book of life before the world was ever formed see you were his thought and then you become a word and a word is a thought expressed then you are manifested that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself god dwelt alone with his thoughts he'll never do that again because his thoughts are being made manifest there was a time god was alone with his thoughts but that's not the day we live in he'll never do that again because those thoughts are being made manifest and that's why we are right here this day is god fellowshipping with his thoughts being made manifest when you're listening to the message you think well i'm listening to a message no god is manifest god is fellowshipping with his thoughts amen you're having fellowship with his gut with god when you fellowship around the word made manifest in this day god will never dwell alone with his thoughts again he will dwell with his thoughts but after they've been made manifest and expressed there is your name on the book of life the book of life is the word of god because the word is god and god is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the bible before the bible became onward and if you're here to do that won't it vindicate that word so your name was represented in the bible before the bible became one word because that is an expression of god's thoughts the bible was written in his mind before the foundation of the world you were there the book of life was written all the names were put in what what is that the book of life the book of life is the word of god amen it's all god's thoughts amen that would become word amen that become manifested word that was the book of life you were there you were secure you were part of that and he's been moving down to express that this is the condescending of god when we i'll go back here so when we have the thought and then the expression and then the manifestation god wanted his thoughts to be made manifest he wanted to come all the way down to here if you're the manifestation if you're part of this manifestation and i'm going to draw a tiny little speck because you and i can be a little speck of the manifestation of god that means if you're a little speck of the manifestation you were a little speck of a thought here and you're a little speck of the expression here and this is all god wanting to come down and having fellowship with his thoughts with his attributes now here's the part that gets complicated because when we're down here living in this life and fallen flesh amen in a fallen world amen we come in contact with all kinds of difficulties and trials and tribulations and and all of this amen that will uh try to set us back and satan uses all these things to try to derail us from our purpose and we have questions and we have doubts and we have all of this but the opening of the seals the message of the hour came to peel all the confusion away and take us all the way back to the thought so that when you're traveling down in this life amen and all of a sudden you come across an obstacle amen we're not wondering i wonder if i'll make it to heaven i hope i get there but you've had a prophet say you started in heaven you're going back to heaven this thing is not going to derail you amen you were part of the word you're written in the bible you were in the bible before the bible became onward and you could say i can find myself in the bible brother ted where do you find yourself in the bible he'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle there i am in revelations amen the bride has made herself ready that's what i'm doing now putting on the garment of the word putting on the word i'm making myself ready i'm in that word that word is me i'm expressing that word revelation 22 say the spirit and the bright say come i'm saying come so before listen before it was written here i mean i was part of it when it was in the mind of god amen when god put it on writing when he wrote that when he had them pin that scripture you and i were part of that thinking when the scripture was penned the spirit and the bride say come so if we were in his thinking before it was written 2 000 years ago amen and now for 2 000 years it's been declared and now it's becoming manifest who can stand against you what will stop you what will derail you what sickness will take you off the scene what's going to happen to an expressed thought of god until it's finished serving its purpose you can see how the opening of the seals peeling back the entire mystery of the word and revealing christ takes away so much fear amen so much doubt and so much manipulation from the devil from things that happened to us if we could just receive what the prophet of god has told us and believe it we can believe it today but it's hard to believe it whenever your world comes crashing down tomorrow but when the world comes crashing down tomorrow we have to remember that god put me here to express his thoughts and nothing's going to happen to me that'll stop that expression of this thought so this tragedy that i'm in has only come so god could express his thoughts see there's overcoming power in revelation we could we could preach and preach and preach and preach uh i don't know trying to get you to have faith to reach out for the promise and believe that god will heal you it's a promise in the bible try to have faith try to reach out try to have faith but when god sent the message and peeled back the mystery and said you were in him before the foundation of the world and you're only here to express him i'm telling you when you catch the revelation of that you're not trying to have faith you're understanding that god is a healer and he will heal me because i'm here for him and no more trying to encourage and trying to push and trying to get the people to have faith amen the message came to unlock the mystery so you could find yourself in the mystery and then all of a sudden the revelation is faith say will he heal me of course he'll heal me i'm here for him i'm expressing him there's something in my life he wants to express he wants to express a part of his nature a part of his word amen of course you'll heal me amen goes on to saying who is this milk is it now we find him at the beginning his attributes and now you were with him then then is when the book of life comes into view see god in the beginning when he thought of you and thought of others like that thought of himself of being tangible think about that again god in the beginning when he thought of you and thought of others like that thought of himself being tangible what was god thinking he was thinking of himself being tangible that was his thoughts the unveiling of god like the attribute see it is god it is in god an attribute is your thought god in the beginning the eternal he wasn't even a god he was the eternal he wasn't even god god is an object of worship or something see so he wasn't even that he was elohim the eternal but in him was thoughts he wanted to become material and what did he do then he spoke a word and the word was materialized that's the whole picture from genesis to revelations there's nothing wrong it's elohim materializing so he can be touched feel and in the millennium there is elohim sitting on the throne see that's right with all of his subjects around him that he predestinated before the foundation of the world so now what is your bible is it 66 books is it a story about joseph a story about moses story about the history of the jews and story about this no it's god elohim materializing he was materializing in moses he was materializing and no he was materializing all the way down so he can be touched and feel god wanted to fellowship with his attributes would you deny what jesus said himself what the bible itself speaks out which is christ's anointed word and if the word abides in you then your anointed person with the word ye abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will it'll be done for you that's christ in you anointing the word for this age whatever age they lived in god divided his word to the ages that's what we're here for when the seals opened up the entire bible it revealed christ when christ was revealed you and i were revealed it was more than just tying together all the loose ends although that was important all that had to come together and the opening of the seals had to come to reveal the coming of christ because jesus was the only one who could open those seals but he peeled back the mystery and brother brown's bible became a new book because when christ was revealed you and i were revealed with him and it's now not about churches and not about denominations and not about this and not about that now it's all about him materializing himself upon the earth finishing his plan of redemption so that he can be known so that he can be expressed and returning back to where we came from i want to read just two more scriptures my little children of whom my travailing birth again until christ be formed in you second one even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory there's been a great mystery there was a great mystery through the bible and christ is the mystery of god revealed but christ is the word made manifest in its age and in its season and there's attributes that are being made manifest in this day and that's part of that great mystery and that makes you and i part of that great mystery and if we can catch that revelation friends it'll settle us down it'll take away all the bouncing around and doubts and confusion and the ups and downs it'll settle that out and say you know what when christ was revealed i was revealed with him when he moved from thought into logos i was there when the logos when the word was being expressed this is why brother branham said amen when moses was coming out of egypt i was there i was there when noah got into the ark i was there you know when brother bram starts going down through i was there why because i'm part of the same thing that expression i'm part of the same thing come from the same place the word expressed word and everywhere the word is expressed i'm part of that expression that's why moses and noah and all of them are part of you and i that's why all of them without us cannot yet be made perfect because we're all part of the word expressing god and now's our day and now's our portion and when christ was revealed you and i were revealed with him man god bless you let's stand i'm not going to go any further i intended for today to be shorter because i want to take a longer time on sunday i just there's a next part i just did not want to get into yet tonight so i just cut it off and said i just want to do this i'm still not to the part i want to get to these last two services have been foundation for really where i want to get where my heart is so pray for sunday but listen friends when we talk about christ it's so much more than what we used to think when we realize what this great mystery that's been in the whole bible it's god materializing it's god condescending it's god becoming tangible through all of his attributes through all those expressions it's way more than we could ever envision and i still think today we haven't even begun to imagine what it really means but if we could just believe what the prophet told us and accept it and allow that to settle our heart and say i was with him there and i was with him there i was with him there and he's not going to lose me because he can't lose me something not my flesh my flesh is rotten you know this is one of the problems we run into when we start talking about the bride is the expression of christ people start to look to flesh and they say you make a mistake and you do something wrong that's not the part i'm talking about i'm talking about something down in the soul amen that seed gene of god that expresses the word of god amen and so when you see me if you see me make a mistake and you see me do something contrary to the word i just want to tell you right now amen that's not god that's me that's my old hybrid flesh amen as my old nature raising up that's not god that's me but when you see an expression of christ come through me amen and it matches the word it surrenders to the word and expresses i want you to know that's not me that's him see we have a hard time separating the outer man from the inner man the hybrid part from the sea gene of god and if we could just do that we would realize so much of what we struggle with is the outer man and the outer man is going to crumble to pieces one day be dead or be changed amen this is not the part that we're worried about it's the part down on inside that came from god god will refashion the outside amen so that he can live in a full expression on the inside but that's where the confusion comes in you know how can i be the manifestation of christ and i just i mean i talked hateful with my wife yesterday that's not the manifestation of christ that's you in your hybrid form but when you surrender and humble yourself amen and the holy ghost moves you back and you surrender and you make things right that's not you that's god in you when you surrender to this word when you hear the prophet straighten out the scriptures and you say that's right when he straightens out the doctrine and you ditch your ideas and you say that's nothing but the truth that wasn't you that was him if we recognize that a lot of the manipulation that the enemy tries the tactics he tries on us will begin to go away and say listen i know i messed up that's not god's faltest mind i know i failed to manifest christ today that wasn't his fault that's mine but there's something in me that's going to come back and say i'm sorry god amen i'll give myself to you and i'll lay myself at your feet and take me and do your will with me and manifest yourself through me and let this word live in me that's him that's the seed that's rising up and saying it's got to be him and not me we didn't save ourselves we're not wonderful people we're not special we're not great we're none of those things but the real you the sea gene of god on the inside what meant to be you all along that's beautiful and that's perfect and that's special we are a walking contradiction think about it brother branham told his daughter he said if you want to see how important you are stick your finger in a bucket of water and find the hole that you left behind so that's how important you are then brother brahm turns around and says you can no more be lost than god can be lost [Music] and god is not complete without you but then he'll say we're nothing he can do without me but i can't do without him we're a walking contradiction you that was born of earthly parents that is just material from the earth with the earthly spirit that is nothing special nothing important and you're not doing god any favors but that portion of himself that he's portioned out to live down inside of you he'll never lose that part and he can't do without that part it's important for us to keep it separated in our minds or else we begin to look at the outer man as perfection and it causes a whole bunch of confusion but it's the life that's why every day paul said i die daily that's why he said i keep under my body which means to beat it back black and blue i keep under my body lest when i preach to others i myself should be a castaway that's why we have to recognize my enemy is my flesh but the real me is an attribute of almighty god i am a son of god and i can no more be lost and he can be lost but i am worthless and nothing at the same time and if we could have that attitude in that approach it'll settle us down in the time of trouble and it'll keep us from trusting our flesh and becoming proud and arrogant it'll keep us humble and confident it'll keep us bold and checked it'll keep us in the right frame of mind man let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for this wonderful day that you've given us we thank you for this word this revelation that you've given to us as we go over it again lord and rehearse the things that have been told to us lord let it register in our soul let it go deep down lord and may there be a settledness that comes into us lord that we would understand lord what your plan is because of the revelation of the hour that there'd be no confusion and no doubt that we would have a comprehension of what it is you're doing in our lives and what it is you're doing in this age god we pray that you would just help us to surrender lord to give ourselves completely over to you that you might take these vessels and manifest yourself through them for god we believe that is the manifestation of christ in this day that your manifestation of your mind your will your heart is going to be on display in these bodies of flesh god we need you we can't do it ourselves we must have your spirit to anoint us your word to direct us lord and may we flesh out the word that you've ordained to be manifest in this day we love you we ask that you be with each of us carry us home lord use us and anoint us for your purpose we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless your friends [Music] all my sins washed away the sun [Music] oh the sun is [Music] [Applause] [Music] i do believe [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] the sun is up now i can chains go
