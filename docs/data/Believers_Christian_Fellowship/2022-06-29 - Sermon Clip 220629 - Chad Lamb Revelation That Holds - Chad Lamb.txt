TRANSCRIPT
========================================
sometimes i'm surprised in me at the lingering effects of amnesia i get surprised at my own self how on sunday we remember it all right during the preaching of the word and when brother graham's laying it out you were in god before the foundation of the world you're a part of god you can no more be lost than god can be god and you're amen hallelujah you sound just like you did before the foundation of the world when he showed you the plan of salvation and then monday morning you go to start the car and it won't start and you forgot you're a son of god and you forgot you're in the mind of god and you forgot all things work together for good i hope i'm not the only one because i'm this is very exposing if i'm the only one and all of a sudden we we slip right as soon as it goes click click spiritual amnesia creeps right back in the lingering effects of spiritual amnesia instead of allowing a higher revelation to stop and say god's doing something it's all under control i don't have to fret it's going to be okay and and you know what you don't even have to be a son of god to know it's going to be okay the battery's dead or starters i mean it's going to be fine it's good don't worry it's going to be okay but how quickly we slip in to you know grumbling complaining moaning and groaning and and we went from having the most wonderful existence on this earth on sunday to now our life is miserable nothing ever works out for me and but sunday you were a son of god and then the whole thing plan was orchestrated for you amen and now your car won't start or somebody else got the promotion or there's going to be a layoff and your life never works out it works out for everybody else never works out for me and why doesn't god like me and i said we got to have a higher revelation amen the word that came in this day was to bring us higher than that amen it was to bring us out of that if we can't take that how are we going to take squeeze pressure things binding or are tying up or our brother bram said they'll close your churches amen and they'll prevent the ministers from preaching when i don't know how i don't know for how long i don't know i mean what will we see what we don't see i don't know but how will we ever endure that if we can't take all these little things in our life and cause us to come down from a higher revelation back to carnal thinking back to being troubled and bound by the things of the world amen this message has been given to us was for the eagles to fly higher and in the higher realm all of a sudden everything in the carnal starts coming into perspective and so we have the message to lift us above this amen we've got the word of god to give us a vantage point that the rest of the world doesn't have so that we don't forget who we are so that the lingering effects of spiritual amnesia don't creep back in with every trial in every circumstance so that we can stay sons of god all the time
