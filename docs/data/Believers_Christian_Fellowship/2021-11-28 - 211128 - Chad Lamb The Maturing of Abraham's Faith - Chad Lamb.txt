father for the privilege of being here this morning for yet another opportunity to gather together and lift our voices and sing your praises god may we always take advantage of the opportunities that you give to us to glorify your name and to sing of your wonderful mercy and your grace for every gathering lord to us is a privilege and every opportunity we have lord we come with expectation to hear from you i pray god you would take over lord that you would take control that you would come yourself and break the bread of life for you've promised to feed us on your word and it's your word that we have need of lord god we pray you would take control and have preeminence lord and may we constantly be yielding unto you a greater preeminence that you might accomplish your purpose through us in this world in this hour that we live for without you we can do nothing we ask your blessings over the word now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen let's take our bibles and look at romans chapter 4 as we get started amen i trust everybody had a wonderful thanksgiving and i had two really nice days to spend with my family and so i really appreciated that and value that very much and we had a good time and then also i wanted to let you know that reminder that brother jean kadema is away ministering today in pittsburgh so we'd remember him today and also next weekend brother ben siebel will be traveling up to brother dan ratliffs in michigan near ann arbor and taking a saturday and a sunday service so that'll be december 4th and december 5th and brother dan and the assembly there have got a new church and they can fit more people so if some of you want to go up for the saturday service you're welcome and there's room but don't forget you're where your post of duty is on sunday amen but that'd be nice if someone were able to make it and support brother ben and support the church up there so i just want to remind you of that amen let's read romans chapter 4 and then we'll be seated romans chapter 4 verse 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all god bless you as you're seated and may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word amen i wanted to just first talk to you for a minute about the email that we sent out we saw an email letting everybody know that we had had three uh individuals in the assembly test positive for kovid over the last week so we just sent that out as information so everybody would have the information they need to make their choice and so i just wanted to talk about that for a minute i was speaking with brother jeremy sanders and he said this is the new norm and i think we've learned and come to realize that covet wasn't going to be a blip on the map and go away like we thought it was amen it may go away yet i believe it will whatever i don't know what it will do but anyways we see waves we see things go we see it come we see numbers reduced numbers increase we see variants and mutations and open borders and closed borders and this is the world we live in friends this is the way things are god has allowed it but as i reflect on it i believe god has allowed it for our maturing amen god has allowed it for the perfection of our faith because you know we're not able we are not able to get out of this world yet and we're not able to leave these bodies yet because this is the way life is and for us you know we have a promise we have a promise of healing so covet is not a frightening thing for us on an individual level but it affects every other facet of our life amen for some people it is it becomes very uh complicated with a work situation or they may have a family member in a nursing home and you got to get in and out of that nursing home and to get in and out of the nursing home you have to answer a questionnaire you have to have a your temperature taken and and you know i don't think any of us have got such a seared conscience that we can go see grandma and lie every question on the questionnaire right so we are affected by these things we have work situations we have unbelieving family members that create situations there's there's complexity to this issue amen this is not just a do we believe god issue we believe god amen do we fear covet no we don't fear covet we've seen god work miraculously for us in this assembly we've seen god's healing power the blood that was shed at calvary is sufficient for all diseases so we're confident in that and it's not a lack of confidence but we do also have to understand the world we live in and the complication that certain individuals have for some of us it's no big deal we're self-employed we just spend time with each other and our families we you know i mean if you're a single man who's self-employed hey you know do whatever you know but we've got all kinds of intermingling where we mingle out into all kinds of different scenarios and if and if we would end up if there's certain ones among us if we would end up with covet and we would test positive it would create a real hardship and a difficulty for us and maybe other people so as a church you know as the lord leads we'll just do as the lord leads but for me i feel to continue to go on and have service because we're all exposed to covet all the time amen it's in the community it's in the grocery stores it's in the doctor's offices it's everywhere amen and not to say that some things may get more serious we may have to take a different action at a different time we'll let god lead in that we don't have all the answers because we don't know all the circumstances but for me i just believe we'll continue on and everybody knows their situation we can't make a decision as a body we're all going to do this those days are over with this is about an individual walking before god finding god's leadership in their life you know your workplace you know whether you got to get in out of that hospital or in and out of that nursing home you know i mean what if you have travel plans i'll tell you a funny story we were going to oregon and just a little bit before we went to oregon i went to the hospital to visit brother john matthews and john matthews had coveted he was in the hospital with a serious case of covid and i had to get dressed up like a surgeon going in for surgery so he put all the equipment on went in prayed with him visited with him was in there for maybe 20 minutes left and we go to take the flight to go to oregon and there's a questionnaire you know if i flight i was flying delta that time and the questionnaire have you been in contact with anybody with covid in the last 10 days and i had to answer i'm at a kiosk i'm answering it for six people so i'm just in there yes yes yes no no no and i do the same thing for everybody we go to security we get through the gate and brianna goes dad you were in the hospital with john matthews i was like did i lie it really started bothering me but thank god i did the math and it had been like 12 or 14 days amen everything was honest everything was straightforward and what we realized is god looked after us because we were in post god's post of duty we were doing what god called us to do he looked after us but you know something that i wouldn't have been able to do myself is go to that questionnaire and lie and get on that plane because my conscience is too tender for that some people have gotten a little bit higher level than me but i'm not there yet i'm too tender so so we realized that these things can be complicated amen and there's there's different reasons that some people have some people have to be more careful than others for different reasons amen and i don't ever want it to become an issue of one believer has more faith than another believer i hope we're beyond that that's nonsense because really this is an individual walk this isn't about a church walk anymore this is about me walking before god and so that's one of those issues where i was in total ignorance but god already looked after me god already took care of it but we can become brash and we can become bold and arrogant and do things anyways knowing the consequences knowing that i have to get on that flight and answer those questions but i'm doing it anyways i'm i'm serving god i'm doing i don't care about that stupid covid you can call it stupid all you want but spitting at it will not make it go away and won't change the circumstances and won't change the consequences we can call covet names but i don't think it hurts covets feelings we can act and many times we act arrogantly and we act with bravado and brashness thinking that's faith and many times that's not faith at all faith can be honest faith can be honest faith can say this is the situation this is what they'll ask me this is the situation this is what i need to do i mean that's mature faith childish faith is calling names and spitting and saying i don't care that's childish but god has not called us to be children this is the bright age where we come to full maturity rapturing faith in a rapturing condition we can't play games in a childish way and call names and spit at things and defy authorities and lie on questionnaires and is that am i the only one who believes that so so for me it comes down to to those kind of situations and we you know we've had we've heard so many things all of us over the last two years we've heard conspiracy theories and ideas and political nonsense and the news has changed the narrative multiple times science has changed their mind one thing i know is there's uncertainty everywhere and we have no idea what will happen next but i know god will lead through it all and i'm confident he'll take care of his children and we just need to be honest we need to be responsible you know when our our children all had a cold they've all been suffering with a cold one by one they've all got it but when we heard somebody somebody in the assembly had covered the last one of our children to be sick was brooke so i told angie to take brook to get a test knowing there's consequences for the information but we can say we can act this way ignorance is bliss ignorance is bliss but ignorance is not responsible because i'm not a single man off by myself can skip a week of services and nobody'll notice we have we interact with everybody and who we interact with we can affect their lives in minor ways or in great ways so we don't have the option i don't have the option of being ignorant i have to take the option of being responsible but thank god our test came back negative amen in fact she wasn't able to get the rapid test she got the longer one and it goes back and it shows if you've had anything in the last 30 to 90 days and it tests for flu and for covid and she's clear of all of it so once again god took care of us god watched out for us we don't have to pretend and fake and bluff and say god took care of me we can be honest and let god take care of us we can be straightforward honest and god can take care of us you know knowing that if that test would have come back positive we would had a really difficult situation this morning i would have had to quarantine for whatever the quarantined period is missed some services made other arrangements it would have been inconvenient for ourselves and many other people but what if we just decided to ignore that you say well god will take care of it god always takes care of us but you know we understand how the law of gravity works does everybody understand how law of gravity works so it would we could climb up to the top of a tower and say god i want you to prove that your purpose for me is not finished because the prophet said that you'll never leave this earth till god's purpose for you is finished i'm jumping off to prove that i'm still in your purpose guess what if your time's not done god will take care of you you will survive that crash but he also may let you deal with the consequences of falling off of a tower you may wish you were dead by the time you hit the bottom because we live in this dimension god placed us here we can't escape it we have people with who've had heart catheterizations people sitting here with stents we've had knee replacements hip replacement shoulder replacements we've had cataracts removed we've had linda's put in our eyes we've had this that and the other this is the reality friends this is where we live we don't fear any of those things but you deal with them we live here this is the world we deal with so we can climb up to the top of the tower jump off and say i'm going to prove that god's purpose for me is not done if he's not done you'll survive but god may let you limp the rest of your life as a reminder that you don't tempt god we're going to be honest so as we move forward we don't know what will happen we don't know what another wave another cycle we don't know what a new strain might do but we know we work with people who are frightened we know we live in a world that's complex and we know whatever challenge we have to face we can face them with honesty responsibility faith and integrity and the very life of god can be on display and there's nothing that we have to fear so we don't have to fake we don't have to bluff we don't have to pretend that's not faith faith is dealing with the circumstances as they are in dealing with the reality as it is and so i i pray that god brings us to that level of maturity for instance the sharibi family is leaving in a little over a week to go back to uganda to visit their family it's an important trip for them they've been gone from home for a long time their family has grown since they're gone they want to go back and see all the parents the aunts the uncles the cousins and all of that amen but but you know they live in a world there's a reality to this world and they know that if something happens they could jeopardize that trip it's not a fear of govid it's the reality of the circumstances that covet has created amen you know many of us if we haven't yet many of us are going to have to face a vaccination mandate one way or another many have already faced it many are in the process of work you know coming up with the rules and figuring out what they're going to do that is an individual decision that you have to find the leadership of going on nobody can tell you to do it nobody can tell you not to do it you have to ask the lord what should we do many have already had the vaccination many will yet get it there's there's folks who have family that live in canada if they want to see their family they have to have a vaccine you can call covet stupid all you want but if you're going to go see your family you have to have a vaccine that's the law of the land so we we have to deal with the situation and ask god what do you want gone people say i'm not afraid of covert but you're afraid of a vaccine so you're still afraid at the end of day you're still motivated by fear i say let faith lead the way amen the way god leads me what i'm comfortable with i don't feel checked in my spirit i know this is my god's leading for me just let god lead amen and let god lead everybody else i hope that we can come to a level of maturity where one person can say i feel like god led me to get the vaccine and stay in the job i'm at and not quit my job because i feel like god put me there supernaturally and hasn't told me to leave and they're requiring this or i lose my employment i've prayed about it and god hasn't given me the green light to quit so i'm going to submit to the master that i'm under and the next person can say god led me not to do that i'm going to quit and get another job and can we come to a level of maturity where we say they are both right that your decision does not cause me to doubt my decision my decision shouldn't cause you to doubt your decision that we've come to a level of individual maturity and faith before god that i can do as god leads me you can do as god leads you and we can both say god bless you i think you're right so as we move forward we just continue to have church as much as possible unless god leads another way and everybody will have to decide what they need to do based off their situation and so god just bless you and god keep feeding us hey god's been taking care of us amen we've got many many testimonies and of supernatural deliverance and god really taking care of us for us to fear anything so let's just move forward in faith and let god lead when brother kyle called me yesterday to let me know that kerry had tested positive she just had a cold but all of a sudden she lost her sense of taste and smell so they went in and got a test immediately and then i had already started on my notes he called me midday yesterday and i'd already started on my notes and i looked down at my title and the title was the maturing of abraham's faith said god this is for the maturing of our faith amen god is using all circumstances to really get us to grow up amen we thought we were mature but we look back and we say that was childish amen and right now we may feel all big and grown up my question is how will we feel 10 years from now if there's a 10 years from now i say god i need you every hour to lead me and to mature me so we we've been preaching before the meetings on the seat of the seat of promise the seat of abraham things like that i thought that the meeting i thought that the meetings would break my chain of inspiration i'd go to something different after the meetings but i was wrong amen so we're going to pick up and look at abraham but for a title i titled the this the maturing of abraham's faith and i just in the bible study want to follow along to the life of abraham and watch how god brings abraham through amen and brings him to what i would say is a level of perfect faith and i want to look at that today we know that abraham we read here in romans chapter 4 verse 16 that abraham is the father of faith for us amen and we who have the faith of abraham are the seed of abraham so we're following in abraham's footsteps so we want to take the nature of the father of faith amen we want to be children of faith so we want to look at abraham's faith brother branham says in the message to patriarch abraham he said we're facing now a grand text tonight the patriarch abraham which was called the father of the faith because that god made him the promise to inherit the earth and his seed and it's through abraham we being dead in christ become abraham's seed and are heirs with him according to the promise so we he is the father of the faith we're the seed of abraham we're children by faith i want to look at ephesians before we move any further ephesians chapter 2. ephesians chapter 2 verse 8. for by grace are you saved through faith in that not of yourselves it is the gift of god amen i titled this the maturing of abraham's faith but i didn't know what else to title it but we know abraham's faith was a faith that god gave him amen and we know that we have faith our faith is a gift from god amen but so when i talk about the maturing of faith when god gives faith amen that's that's sufficient so when i talk about the maturing of faith that's only from our perspective but but really what i'm talking about is god amen getting more of abraham out of the way so that that faith can be expressed amen so the maturing of our faith is really the changing in our attitude and and changing in our reaction in the way we deal with situations to leave ourselves out of it so that that faith can be expressed amen so when god gave faith he already gave us a mature faith but it's shrouded in this body amen and underneath this intellect and this mind reasoning and all the senses that we have and we we learn as we go how to deny thought how to deny emotion how to deny our eyesight and the circumstances to let this faith really take the lead amen and so that's what we're looking at and talking about this morning let's go to genesis chapter 11 and we'll begin back here in genesis and stay here primarily genesis chapter 11. verse 31 when we when we got that uh covet test and it came back negative i said huh you can still have a cold i didn't realize it was possible still to get a cold so we know i know of about four people who have had that cold and got tested and got negative results so there's a cold going around through but i thought it's amazing we have proof you can still have a cold not everything is covered praise god the old sicknesses are back amen i never thought we'd be happy about that amen god is good friends god is good genesis chapter 11 verse 31 and tara took abraham his son and lot the son of heron his son's son and sarai his daughter-in-law his son abram's wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came into heron and dwelt there and the days of terror were 205 years and tara died in heron i want you to that i want you to look at this scripture and it says tara which was abraham's father took abraham his son and lot and their spouses and they went from er unto heroin now this is really important as we move on because you'll find that that they're making a move and this move is critical to god's calling for abraham but the bible says that tara took them and went terror was still in the lead terror was still the father he was still making the decision amen but then while they're inherent terror died right so let's look at chapter 12 verse 1. now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee brother brennan takes the scripture and he shows us that god had called him before not in heron but when he was in ur god had called him and told him to separate he said get out of thy country from thy kindred from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee so god when he not hearing heron but god now the lord had said unto abram he's talking about something he told abraham previously so when abraham was in ur because this is what the prophet tells us that he called him while he was in ur and he told him leave your country leave your kin folks leave your father's house and come to a place where i call you amen and we know that abraham believed that is that true god told us abraham he had a gift of faith and when abraham heard the voice of god he believed god was calling him to leave and to go to this land amen but the initial action showed that there was still a lot of abraham mixed in and over shrouding this faith because he believed the word of the lord and he must and this is just me he must have shared that with his father hey father you know we've got to go i've got to go and his father said okay let's go and tara still in the lead amen takes abraham and abram at this time and his wife and lot and all their possessions and they move up to heron because they're moving up out of mesopotamia up north to cross over amen into the promised land so now tara is taking the lead it's not that abraham doesn't believe the word of god amen but abraham he it's still working out right we're still going in that direction i know god said leave leave leave but but dad wants to go too it's okay right the reason i say it this way is because when we look back on our lives this is exactly how our lives go we believe the word of the lord when we heard the message we believed it amen but but we reacted to it in such an immature way amen but god through time is developing abraham and bringing abraham into his word and into his promise and dealing with all abraham's situations until the word is completely confirmed amen and abraham comes into the reality of that word so now i read it again the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country from thy kindred from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that blessed thee and cursed him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was 75 years old when he departed out of heron now the initial call was to separate from country kinfolk father's house but we know then after that commission tara takes them to heroin but in god's grace in god's mercy and god watching over his promise he allows tara to die that wasn't an act of abraham's tremendous faith that was god amen bringing about his own word in abraham's life that was god being true to his promise that was god being merciful to abraham that was god watching over his word that was not a result of abraham's tremendous faith although abraham believed the word of god from the very beginning how many of you can look back over your life and say i believe the message when i heard it but i carried a lot of nonsense with me for a long time but by god's grace he would bring he would begin to remove nonsense from me amen different relationships would fade away amen churches would break up people would go different directions it wasn't your tremendous faith that made all of that happen it was the mercy of god to keep his promise to you and keep moving you into the word of god so we watch how god's dealing with abraham because we're the children of faith and the way that god deals with the father of faith is how he's dealing with the children of faith and we can have confidence in one thing that i'm saved by grace through faith and that not on myself it is the gift of god i've done a lot of things amen that i realize now weren't according to that faith amen but i still believed god and god still worked it out you know when when the scripture says in verse 1 now the lord had said unto abram amen it gives us no prerequisite condition on abraham's part god did not say because abraham was found righteous god did not say because he was a good man this is pure raw election brother branham says their family was still caught up in idolatry that took place in babylon and the family tara came down from babylon and brought the family from babylon to er and and brought many of those practices from babylon to earth god was calling abraham out of hedonistic uh heathenistic paganistic multi-god religion and abraham was raised in this he was stuck in this and god was not calling abraham because abraham had merit he was not calling abraham because of conduct he was calling abraham because of the election he had before the foundation of the world he was to somebody who's just like everybody else amen and he says you you're the one get thee out of this land leave the country leave thy kindred leave thy father's house and i'm going to make out of you a great nation and everybody that blesses you will be blessed and everybody that curses you will be cursed and all the nations of the world will be blessed in thee can you imagine abraham what did i do is like mary with a virgin mary she's going to the well to fetch water like she did every day she's a spouse to a man to be married she's as common as common can be and all of a sudden an angel shows up and says hey thou blessed highly favorite of the lord yes it's like gideon gideon is behind he's hiding behind the wine press threshing out wheat amen because the philistines are the keep coming and taking their wheat amen and an angel shows up and said behold thou mighty man of valor mighty man of valor was hiding behind a wine press threshing out a little wheat to hide it amen from the from the canaanites so that they wouldn't take it from them he didn't know he was a mighty man of valor mary didn't know she was highly favored of the lord abraham didn't know he was chosen to be the father of faith neither did you and i know amen when we started our journey in this life we didn't know that we were the seed of abraham we didn't know that we were the children of god elect and four known before the foundation of the world but god came to us in whatever condition he found us in in whatever condition he found us and he come to us and said you're one of them and then there was something in us that believed what we heard just like there was something in abraham that could believe what god told him there was something in us that believed what we heard and now we were believers now abraham from that point on was a believer but abraham did conduct did not always demonstrate that he believed what god told him do you agree with me he told abraham leave your father's house leave your kinder leave your country and all of a sudden tara says okay good idea boy let's go and what's abraham going to do this is his father he he knows what god said but now his father throw him along and can you imagine the pickle he was in many of us have been in pickles before everybody's going this way but god wants us to go this way we don't know what to do and sometimes we've allowed that to sweep us into something we shouldn't have got swept into but somewhere along the line god in his mercy broke that thing apart so that we could get back to where he wanted us to be this when we talk about the faith of abraham amen we're not talking about abraham being a a giant of faith of his own will of his own mind we're talking about a man who who god had planted a seed of faith god come and called god instructed god watched over god protected god moved god changed circumstances god did it all he gave him the promise then god kept his own promise even when abraham wasn't doing a thorough job god still kept his promise to abraham brother branham said this was the unconditional promise amen god had made conditional promises to abraham he broke it to noah broke it amen promises were broke we're broke we're broke so god says i will make you the a great nation i all the families of the world will be blessed in thee he never said if you do i will he said i'm going to do this you're the one and this is what i will do and from that point on god was with abraham making sure that what god promised god was going to do and as abraham worked through this life and through these circumstances and situations kept changing abraham kept releasing more amen to the promise more to the word of god and less to his own thinking amen let's keep going now he says i want to catch this in verse 4. so abram departed that's what god told him to do so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him that was what was not supposed to happen he told him to separate from his kindred and his father's house and so now he goes and lot went with him and you can imagine abra abram he says i'm doing what god told me to do now now listen this is so easy for us to do i'm doing what god said i'm going to a strange land i'm leaving mine going to a strange land and lot decided to come along but it wasn't full obedience to the word of god brother man told us it wasn't full obedience to the word of god so he goes and brother banham says this and jehovah jireh from 1958 said i want you to notice abraham coming down out of babylon with his father and dwelt in the land of shinar and perhaps had his living there his wife was sarah his half-sister now he was 75 years old and sarah was 65 years old before god ever spoke to him and made the covenant with him 65 year old woman 75 year old man and god said walk before me and be perfect god made the covenant with abraham unconditionally wasn't any conditions if you do this i'll do he made a covenant with a man once like that adam and he broke him man breaks his promise god can't break his promise god determined to save man he made the covenant to abraham unconditionally told him i've done this and it's going to be this way this is going to be and you're coming to me at an old age so god gives the promise god's going to keep the promise abraham's the one nobody else will become the one so god has got to get abraham in the condition listen there's nobody else there's there's nobody else that's going to fulfill this promise but us there's going to be a change in the body and the completion of a rapture that's going to take place there's going to be people who change from distant to that dimension and have their atoms change in their body who else is going to do that who will we leave it to god has called us then if god has called us and that's the promise for this hour and that's why the seals were open and that's why this thunder sounded to give us rapturing faith amen then who else will do it we'll do it how are we going to do it we can't do amen he has to do it through us and everything that's standing in the way of that fulfillment one by one god works us through and brings us through and moves it out of the way what's he doing increasing our faith really it's not increasing our faith he's decreasing ourself we are decreasing so that that faith he's already placed in us is increasing so that life of himself that's already there will have greater expression so i believe abraham was learning not to trust himself i think abraham was learning not to have confidence in himself so we know abraham leaves he travels over to the land that god told him and he gets in the land he's still not in full obedience because lot has come with him and now lots of tag along and he's brought lot into the promised land with him he's still not in full obedience but look what happens here in verse six chapter 12 verse six and abram passed through the land unto the place of cesium unto the plain of mora and the canaanite was then in the land and the lord appeared unto abram and said un unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him now as abraham was beginning in his journey he believes god does anybody doubt abraham believes god abraham is not an unbeliever abraham is a believer but he's not in full obedience he's in partial obedience because lot comes with him but as soon as even impartial obedience he makes a step towards god god appears to him anyways and confirms the promise i want to ask you have you always been in full obedience to this word and when you realize looking back i was not always was god still dealing with you or did he quit dealing with you did god still come and inject himself supernaturally in his life did he still speak to you did he still did he still make a way for you did he still heal you did he still deliver you did he still come and appear himself before you amen did he still open the word to you you look back and say i was in partial obedience but he was still there because you were making steps in the right direction and he as a father was guiding you along amen god understands us god understands where we are god's made a promise and he will get to that promise and nothing will stop him from getting to that promise and god is not just going to sit back and say hey buddy you're on your own amen we every every listen every time abraham made a step towards god in the promise god showed up and talked to him god dealt with him god delivered him god brought him further along in the journey amen because god said this is the one this is the promise it will happen and for us god says you're the one this is the promise it will happen when we were when we were in our walk and in our immaturity and in the and then the stages that we went through god was working with us all along bringing us from one situation to the next situation delivering from one obstacle and another obstacle and opening more to us along the way and what has been happening amen our faith has been increasing amen our confidence in god has been growing our understanding of who we are our understanding of the promise it's been growing all along amen brother branham says in the message of grace we'll call another character where god's grace was extended many of them we'll just speak of a few abram abraham abraham no special man came down from the tower of babel perhaps come out of an idolater bunch his father come down in the land of shinar down there to dwell in the city of ur and while he was there god spoke to him by grace not because he was different not because he was a better man but by grace god called him the bible clearly makes that known oh abraham how abraham tested god's patience i love that statement amen that statement is really for us to get understanding i don't know that god's patience can be tested i'm not sure but he said oh abram how abraham tested god's patience told him said abraham stay in this land don't you go out of it but as soon as famine come abraham run so so brother branham describes it to us like this god called abraham nobody else was going to be called god's watching over amen but abraham sometimes amen brother ben says he tested god's patience oh friends look back on your life do you ever look back and say oh is there any place you look back in your life as you walk as a believer and say oh god i'm sorry amen if abraham tested god's patience what about you and i but we found out there's no limit to god's patience there's no end to his mercy there's no cutting off of his grace amen when he's dealing with his children let's go to genesis 12 and 10 and look at this that the brother bam talks about genesis 12 and 10 and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land and it came to pass when he was near come near into the egypt that he said unto sarah his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive i want to take a look at this and focus our attention on this scripture and look at this stage in abraham's journey this stage in abraham's journey abraham is still trying to save himself abraham is trying to save his life because of his wife and he's trying to save his life because of famine god told him brother baby tells us over and over god told him to go to this land and stay in this land he wasn't supposed to leave the land amen but when hardship come when a trial came abraham didn't stick with what god said abraham used his own reasoning and with unknown reasoning he said if we stay here we'll starve and he runs down to egypt because egypt has bread so abraham is trying to save his own life i say this self-preservation is a sign of immature faith you say what else would a man do i don't know what else would a man would do but just stay with god's word and say god you told me to stay in this land there's nothing here you have to provide and god proved that he could because the next generation when isaac comes on the scene isaac goes down to gerrard right on the border of egypt and he's about to cross into egypt for the same reason because there's a famine and god tells isaac he says do not go down into egypt because there was a famine and it's the same passage where he says he planted amen in the time of famine he planted in this famine season and god gave him a bountiful harvest of a hundred times more so god proved in the next generation down what he could do if somebody would stay where god said stay and do what god said do amen you don't need reasoning you need the word of god we don't need logic we don't need self-preservation we need to we need to sacrifice ourselves completely and let the word take dominion abraham and his walk was still preserving himself amen we're going to stay here we're going to die god said isaac you stay here and don't leave isaac planted and he reaped 100 or a bountiful 100 times more everybody else was hungry isaac had more than enough why did isaac have more than enough because he's a better farmer obviously he knows how to put the seed in he he's got irrigation he's a better he he did better because he obeyed god god said don't go he stayed so god's proving what can be done if we stay with his word they say how do you blame him as a man i don't blame him amen as a man who uses reasoning and logic and that's the reasonable logical thing to do obviously if his wife's very fair he knows how things work in that day amen they'll kill me to take her so logically he comes up with a plan to protect himself right but god comes down on the scene and shows that i can protect everybody because when pharaoh is going to take sarah and then he comes down and protects sarah and protects that womb because that's part of the promise see friends what abraham was learning was to take god out his word and not add any thinking to it just to take god at his word let's go over here to chapter 13. i'm just going to take it in order we're just going to march along in order chapter 13 verse 5 and lot also which went with abram had flocks had herds had tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and the herdman of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the in the perizzite dwelled in in the land and abram saith unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee in between my herdman and thy herdmen for we be brethren i want to stop right there for a minute god is in every detail when abram when abram went down into egypt and he had this thing he left the land he wasn't supposed to leave the land amen god preserved him he wasn't supposed to do all that but because of the situation amen pharaoh greatly increased the riches of abraham so that when they come out of egypt now abraham is rich you say man god is good even in his mistake he makes him rich and i say yeah it's good to be a son of god but why did god give him all of these riches amen in the next verse he and lot now have so much they can't live together anymore why is it that they can't live together anymore because god said separate from your kindred so god is going to work a circumstance that's going to cause separation how did god work the circumstance to bring separation he blessed them so abundantly that they could no longer live together god is watching over his word god is watching over his child so let's separate he says verse 9 is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee for me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and behold all the plane of jordan and it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrh even as the garden of god liked the land of egypt as thou comest out of zoar then lot chose him all the plain of jordan lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other abram dwelt in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom but the men of sodom were wicked sinners before the lord exceedingly and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated catch this god's going to come and speak to abraham after lot separated how did god get lost separated god worked the plan god worked the circumstances to do what abraham wasn't able to do of his own self-will god created a circumstance to help the situation along and when they finally separated from one another god comes to speak to abraham again and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward southward eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give him and to thy seed forever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land and the length of it in the breath of it for i will give it unto thee then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamrie which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord i say praise god the grace of god amen abram he he knew the word of god amen but god amen first he allows terror to die to keep the word this is not abraham's great faith in action moving things it's god moving according to his word then he brings a lot along and they get into these situations but god brings brings something along that'll help abraham to do what abraham hasn't yet done of his own accord and it brings a separation but as soon as there's a separation god's not coming down in great wrath and punishment upon abraham he appears to abraham to once again confirm the promise to him see for god amen god is keeping his word for god it's about the promise god is keeping his word let's keep our place here in genesis keep your hand in genesis but turn with me to hebrews hebrews chapter 11 so far we are reading about abraham moving in god's calling in god's commission and we know what brother branham said that god could never really bless abraham until he completely separated but we see how that complete separation came not by the will of abraham but by the mercies of god but let's look in hebrews chapter 11 verse 8. by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he suddened in a strange land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose builder and maker is god i'm so thankful for the account in hebrews because the account in hebrews to me is the heavenly account when you just read hebrews and you don't read genesis you're like abraham was a great by faith he left his land by faith he did this by faith and he was looking for a city all of those things are 100 percent true by faith he left his home by faith he's sojourn in a strange land by faith amen but the bible's not listing that he didn't fully obey because he took lot along he didn't fully obey because of his father he didn't he didn't fully obey because he left the land it's only looking at what abraham believed and abraham believed the promise even if his actions were missteps even if for a little bit he stepped to the right god will bring him back he stepped to the left god will bring him back but the heavenly record only looks at what abraham believed and all along abraham believed the word of god he believed what god said he believed the promise of god he did obey he did walk amen when where he was lacking god was working out the details i hope that there's just a heavenly account of my life and says he believed the message of the hour he stood fast with the word of god he believed what the prophet said amen because i can look back on my life and say i believe but i still did that i believed but i allowed that compromise i believe but i still went along with this even though i knew it wasn't right amen i want all those things erased from my records i want a hebrew account of my life amen that says he believed the message when he heard it he believed it he walked out of his denomination and he walked into the promise of god and he believed the message and left us home and left all of this and left relationships that's the heavenly account the reality was i prayed tears full in my pillow saying god please don't let me be rejected by my family god if i could stay here and win them over god if i could just stay in the church and change the church the earthly account and the heavenly account are looking at two different pictures the earthly account is looking at my actions the heavenly accounts looking at my faith because there was something in me to believe the word but i needed child training to be able to stand on that word and god god brought separations in my life it wasn't me standing up at a family reunion god has called me into the message of the hour i'm leaving you behind like it was a human being scared and trembling and not not knowing how to handle all the situations that were around me but god was looking at a faith seat in there and a promise that he had and a plan he had before the foundation of the world and god said i'll take care of all these situations i'll bring conflict and separation and i'll bring this and i'll bring that and i'll get them into the right place oh i love the life of abraham because i look back and say the same god that led abraham as the same god who's led me the same god who took care of abraham's deficiency is the same god who took care of my deficiencies the same one who corrected abraham's misstep is the same one is correct in my misstep amen i'm following in the path of abraham my father in faith hebrew says abraham believed by faith he left us on absolutely that's nothing but the truth abraham always believed it but he just didn't always have all the actions right but he always believed it in the message forsaking all from 1962 he said and god never did blase abraham until he totally obeyed him abraham wanted to take his daddy along and the old man was a fly in the ointment all the time finally he died then lot there was strife and everything and then as soon as abraham fully obeyed god and separated himself and let lot go on down there in the good lands wherever he wanted to go down in sodom then god appeared to abraham and said lift up your eyes i give the whole thing to you abraham was the one who separated he was the one who separated all to follow to follow god and he is the father of faith he is the one that we believe to be the faithful one the promise was made to abraham and his seed we being dead in christ or abraham's seed airs with him according to the promise if god could do what he did for abraham why can't we let god do it for us amen if if god could take care of all these situations for abraham to keep moving him in the promise why can't we let our past be god taking care of all these situations and move us into the promise instead of cringing over every mistake why can't we just thank god god thank you when i couldn't you could amen when i was failing you weren't failing when i had small vision you had big vision you know sometimes i i think this is just me pondering again that abraham wanted to take care of lot abraham's father took care of lot when lot's father died and now abraham's taking care of lot when when lot's grandpa dies and i think he wanted to take care of life i i don't know this for sure but this is just being a human being lots of family member whose father died grandfather died abraham really has been looking after him and no doubt abraham just wants to take care of him watch over him but god said separate from all so god even understands that part of abraham god even understands that desire in abraham and we see that desire never went away god brought the circumstances for separation when there was separation they separated god confirmed the promise but then lot down in sodom amen got in trouble brother branham said whenever you separate from the believers you get in trouble then the psalmist got in trouble and kings come in and took them away and who was fit to rescue the whole thing it was the one who was separated was fit to bring the rescue sometimes we think non-separation is how we take care of people not understanding that sometimes separation is the way we take care of people remember when god was going to go down and he was going to destroy sodom and he reveals it to abraham and abraham begins a series of intercession amen who is abraham worried about most down in sodom abraham is worried about lot down in sodom so he is interceding with god saying god would you surely the god of all the earth the righteous judge wouldn't destroy the righteous with the wicked what if you find 50 and he begins to what's he doing this shows that abraham still had a desire to take care of lot abraham didn't hate lot that wasn't what the separation was about abraham wasn't tired of lot that's not what the separation was about the separation was the separation for the word but because he was separated unto god he could intercede to god on behalf of lot who was stuck down in sodom sometimes we're afraid of separation and separation sometimes is the very thing that gives us intercession gives us an audience with god and god is mindful of these things god god didn't hate lot he didn't rip him away and destroy him god just brought a separation but abraham was still mindful of law when he got caught up and got carried away i mean i don't believe abraham got caught up in every battle and war that ever took place but this one involved his nephew and his nieces and he went and rescued them and brought them all back when he did that who did he meet on the way back but melchizedek the high priest of god why would god show up in such a tangible way amen to take care of abraham because this is just by the chat again i believe that what abraham did pleased god so we have to understand our separation not i hate these people they're bad influences on me i'm not gonna have anything to do with them i'm separating to the word and i stay separated by the word but my heart is still there god can you help them god can you deliver them hey don't be afraid to go pray for somebody in the hospital when they're sick they don't have to be a believer you can go fight the army of cheddar lamour and you can go into the hospital and lay hands on somebody if they can believe you amen they can be healed don't be afraid to fight for those that we've even had to separate over the word we know mindful we know god is mindful of these things because god says god says when he delivers lot he said god remembered abraham and delivered lot you know the best thing that we can do for our family who don't believers the best thing we can do for others is to give ourselves completely to the word of god and obey everything he says that's what when when abraham and lot separated abraham was still looking out for lot and abraham was still interceding for lot and god was mindful of them let's go to genesis chapter 15. after the battle after he delivers back lot and all of sodom he meets melchizedek melchizedek serves him communion he paid ties to melchizedek amen then sodom on the the king of sodom offers to let him keep all the spoils and he won't do it he says because i will not i've swore i've raised my hand to the god of heaven and i will not take anything unless you say you've made me rich and after that it says chapter 15 verse 1 after these things the word of the lord came into abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and my exceeding great reward and abram said why did god say that because abram wouldn't take any of the spoil and said god is the one who makes me wealthy not you i don't need anything you have all i need is god i want to ask you at this stage of the journey do you think abraham is starting to mature in his faith you think abraham's starting to realize some things amen i believe he's starting to realize some things he said i'm not taking anything unless you get credit for making me rich i swear to god i'm not going to take it off i'm trusting in god and god comes on and says i'm your shield and exceeding great reward and abraham said lord god what will thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eleazer of damascus and abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thy heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward the heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness i'd like to continue saying whenever god spoke to abraham abraham believed it right now god says and as abraham journeys along god is constantly giving him more insight into the promise he's bringing more information along at first he says amen thy seed shall possess the land so now abraham knows he's going to have a seed he said in you shall all the nations be blessed so he knows he's going to have a seed amen but then now god comes along and says out of your bowels shall come a seed so now god as moses or as abraham journeys along god is giving him more insight into the promise more revelation about what he's promised him can you see yourself in this journey so now he knows and the scripture says this i want you to catch this and he believed the lord in the lord and he counted to him for righteousness he believed what god said and god counted them for righteousness so what does he do next chapter 16. now sarah abram's wife bare him no children and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and sarah i said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearken to the voice of sarai and sarah abram's wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife so now we know that that this is the birth of ishmael this is how ishmael comes about but but abram already says he believed god god says no out of your bowel shall come a seed not not this eleazar damascus not your servant not one born in your house but one that comes out of your bowels and he believed god and god counted to him for righteousness but now he comes to sarah and sarah is now stuck in reasoning and the reasoning is god it's obvious i'm not going to have a baby look at me look how old i'm at god hasn't allowed it so now the next best thing that's legal and appropriate in our generation is to take my handmaid and raise up children unto me by that and abraham says okay that sounds reasonable and abraham going into hagar is never doubting or disbelieving god he believed god but he's using his own reasoning to bring about the promise they're using their own strengths they're using their own ideas to fulfill the word of god and god has to break abraham of this kind of thinking so god allows an ishmael to come on the scene let's go to chapter 17. when when ishmael comes on scene god doesn't strike abraham dead see in all of this walk abraham was believing god but he was believing god as a babe that was growing and god was working with abraham to grow him and to move him into position god didn't strike him dead every time he disobeyed when he went from ur to heron with his dad and lot and everything god didn't strike him dead god just made sure tyra passed off the scene so abraham said okay now it's time to go he goes but lot comes along god doesn't strike him down when he gets in the law into the land god shows himself to him and confirms the promise again what's he doing he's growing abraham he's molding abraham he's bringing abraham into the promise if god can do that for abraham can he do it for you and i friends can when we started on this journey we believed the word of god but we did a lot of immature things but we believe the word of god we believed he was our healer we believe the delivery we believe he sent malachi for amen to bring us out of denominationalism we believed amen that he was bringing us to a rapture we believed these things and we did a lot of immature things but he never threw us away because he couldn't throw away his own elect amen he couldn't change the promise he has to work with the elect and work in the promise and bring us into position to fulfill the word what has god been doing with us all these years he's been doing the same thing he didn't to abraham have any of you made a step to the right in egypt and god brought you back and maybe even had a reward afterwards still blessed have you ever made a step to the left and god brought you back yes god didn't choose you because of your actions he chose you because of predestination god will not throw you away because of your actions you may suffer from them but god will not throw you away because of predestination amen it's not this is not legalism this is not good conduct then reward god is looking at who believes me and who believes my word god is the master of circumstances he can arrange things to where separation will come god can set up the circumstances where you'll make the right choice i don't know if you've ever been there i've been there before amen all of a sudden you've got 10 options and by the time it's done you only have one more option does that ever happen to you what was happening god's watching over his word god's bringing his promise to pass god will not lose one genesis 17 15 and god said to abraham ask for sarah thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and sarah that is 90 years old and abram said unto god oh that ishmael might live before thee and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him god's going to bring the promise about anyhow amen and every stage of the journey god is giving abraham clearer understanding of the promise first you're going to be a mighty nation next the seed's going to come out of you well then we have ish we have ishmael no it's going to come through sarah at every stage of the journey god is bringing a little more revelation about he's not changing his word he's bringing a greater understanding of the original promise how many of you see the message the clearer than you saw it 40 years ago 20 years ago 10 years he never changed the message he's given you clearer revelation of his message things that we thought we don't think those ways anymore what we thought was a right interpretation we've given those things up what we thought was right conduct we've turned from those things why because all along the journey god has guided us and turned us and every every step along the journey he's giving us more revelation on the original promise he's not changing the message he's opening more of it for us to see with abraham he wasn't changing the message he was opening more of the message for abraham to see and every time god opened more of the message abraham believed it lo and behold the faith that he had originally was the faith that he had all along the journey the faith the first believers call was the faith that he had that sarah was going to have a child is that right praise be to god so if abraham had the same faith to believe the promise originally the same faith debris believe that isaac will come through sarah what's changing abraham's changing you and i have the same faith that we had to believe this message originally that was the faith of god that was a seed of faith by grace we still have the same faith to believe the message the way we believe it now what's changed we've changed praise god amen let's look at no i don't want to look at this let's go somewhere else we know that later let's go to chapter 21. we'll look at chapter 21 verse 1. genesis 21 1 and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken for sarah conceived and bear abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bore to him isaac listen god keeps his word abraham and sarah had no ability in themselves to bring about the promise of god the only thing they could do is believe god every time god revealed more of the word to them all they could do was believe it and accept it they had no power to do anything but when it was time for god to fulfill his promise god visited sarah according to his word according to the time of life and then sarah conceived and brought forth the son see there's promises in our lives but we have no power to produce them there's times that that we get stuck in a devil's trap of thinking things aren't happening in our lives because somehow there's something wrong with us we're wrong somewhere we have to do a better job we we're not committed enough i mean and i'll tell you the truth here's the truth if you want to know the real truth you're not committed enough i'm not committed and you know what else you're not sincere enough and you're not dedicated enough so when the devil brings that the there's no way that you're ever going to be committed enough to get god to do something for you are sincere and the prophet was told you must be more sincere that's true we must be more sincere but when you become more sincere you'll need to be more sincere yet do you need to do a better job you need to do a better job should you be more faithful you should be more faithful hey we agree when the devil comes and says you need to be more committed just say you're right i need to but that's not going to change the way god views me or my faith in god or god keeping his promise he he is not waiting on me amen to to do something in my own will and my own strength he's waiting for me to believe him and then follow through with what i see and walk and what he's led me to walk in i mean there's things that i don't see yet how will i see it until he opens it there are things we don't understand yet how are we going to understand it until god opened it takes divine revelation you don't get divine revelation by hours of reading but should you read you should read should you read more you should read more you don't read the message enough you don't listen to enough tapes see you can preach that in a way where everybody walks out of here feeling guilty that we haven't taken the rapture yet because i don't pray enough i don't read enough listen to enough tapes i don't read enough messages i'm not consecrated enough or sincere enough what could abraham do to produce a baby what could sarah do to produce a baby there's nothing they could do did abraham need to be more sincere yes did abraham need to be more obedient absolutely without question do you need to do more of the same yes but until god opens it until god changes it what are you gonna do this is not we're not playing a merit badge system with god amen you get so many points and then i'll release a promise to you if you come to church all the time don't miss communion pay all your tithes and you raise your children right i'm going to heal you if we had to live in that setup amen we would be the most discouraged people in the world but we live in a totally different kind of setup from god where god says i already have a plan for you i force saul i will bring it to pass amen all i'm asking you to do is surrender to me as i reveal myself to you believe me all these things are had by faith when god brings it believing abraham believed god at what point did abraham not believe god we would look back and see what abraham then said that's mistakes it is mistakes going to egypt mistake taking lot along mistake going to heroin with his dad mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake mistake what did it change did it change anything in the purpose of god or who he was or what god's plan was i'll ask you this did god work with all of his mistakes he allowed his mistake in egypt to foreshadow his seed coming down into egypt because when his seed goes down into egypt when when he when abraham goes into egypt he goes into egypt because what because there's a famine in the land when the children of israel come to egypt why did they come to egypt because there's a famine in the land when he goes to pharaoh when it's time for abraham to leave when god wants abraham to leave he lets plagues break out in pharaoh's house when it's time for the children of israel to leave he allows plagues to break out in pharaoh's house that's curious and when abraham leaves he leaves wealthy when the children of israel leave they leave wealthy is god you're saying god is even in his mistake and god is even using his mistake absolutely god is in every part of our lives god will allow you to stub your toes so that you know that it hurts to kick that rock i'm talking natural but it's spiritual too god will allow us to make spiritual mistakes to realize that his way is the only way his path is the only one that works amen god subjected us to this life amen we're in the world but not of the world but we suffer the same with the same things the world suffers with if not you wouldn't get cataracts need glasses have braces get a heart stint take an ibuprofen but we're here struggling with faith believing who we are and that god's got a plan in our lives and through it all he's healing delivering guiding he's doing something in my life i'm here for a purpose that's the difference we make mistakes can god work with your mistakes god can work with your mistakes i've said many many times abraham goes down to gerar after the body change you would think everything would be perfect you know but he goes to gerrard amen and still they keep this old lie that sarah is my sister and we know all that happens down there with the beam elect and he goes out of there amen and it's kind of a shameful thing it sounded disgraceful that abraham would do this twice but you know that is the only scripture in all the bible that a prophet can pick up four thousand years later and say see they received a body change at the visitation of god so can god even work with mistakes god can even work with mistakes the key is to have the faith of abraham and believe god's called me god will do what he said he will do do better okay i'll do better i want to do better is there anybody here who doesn't want to be more sincere raise your hand and then we'll have an altar call does anybody here not want to try hard anybody here not to want to be moral be we all want the same thing friends but it's going to take god guiding us there's still things we're blind to there's still things we're going in the wrong direction there's still things he needs to open to us but if we could look back at our life we could have absolute confidence the god who first called me and first brought the message to me has never forsaken me through all of my ups and downs all of my sidesteps he keeps moving me along and as he moves me along he does the same thing for me he did for abraham he keeps opening up more of his plan to me and i see it more clearly oh i will be a seed but it's not going to be my servant it'll come from me oh it'll come from me but it'll come through sarah every step he's learning more thanks be to god let's look at romans chapter 4. keep your place in genesis we're going to come back to that romans chapter 4. and verse 17. romans chapter 4 verse 17 as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickened the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that i might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness thank god for the romans account and for the account in hebrews the romans account was he was not weak in faith well what was this deal with ishmael i don't know but he wasn't weak in faith what was his deal with lot i don't know but he wasn't weak in faith all along he was growing stronger in faith not growing weak in faith growing stronger in faith believing the promise more becoming more sure of god becoming more confident in god's plan and abraham is starting to give up his own ideas and just take god at his word brother branham said in the message have faith in god he said my subject is have faith in god now we are taught in god's blessed word that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word or the of the word now faith is also an experience and many times faith is had by a former experience makes faith grow faith being the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so many people fail to find the real meaning of what faith is some people believe that faith is some sensation or some emotion but the bible said that faith is the substance of things hoped for but the man was telling us that many times faith he said many times faith is had by a former experience that makes faith grow why have we gone through all the things we've gone through so that we can learn to trust in faith and not in ourselves let's go to genesis 22 and i want to look at abraham's great test this is a very very very familiar story but to me when i look at this test when he takes isaac or mount moriah i see a man who has come to perfect faith and confidence in the promise of god you look back on what abraham did and how abraham obeyed or partially obeyed or got in egypt got to goreer had ishmael you look at all of these things and you see a man who is believing god all the way but he's going to right to the left to the right to the left but god is bringing him through all of that and you come to genesis 22 and you find a man who's entered into a level of maturity that i say is a goal or a target for us this is in genesis 22 1 and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am let's go down to verse 4 or no i'm sorry verse 1 again all right verse 2. sorry and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac who now loveth and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains that i will tell thee of and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went into the place of which god had told him now listen this makes no logical sense god had promised abraham his seed the promise at the beginning was attached to abraham's seed god kept confirming the promise of a seed in the land a seed and a land and he kept revealing that seed until finally give a revelation of sarah and isaac and isaac the promised seed and now god comes along to tempt or to test abraham in abraham's test he would take the very thing that abraham has believed in all along the very culmination of all of his faith and all of his experiences he would tell him to take that now take that thing that is the product of thy faith and the thing you've been pointed to all your life and slay it it makes zero logical sense but abraham has come to the place where he is not trusting in logical sense anymore he has learned to take god at his word this is not i'd say this is the same man but this is not the same man that went with his father to her on and took lot to the promised land this is not the same man that went to egypt this is not the same end that went to garage this is not the same man that took hagar and raised up ishmael he's the same but something has changed in abraham abraham has learned something in his journey look at verse 4. i don't want to go to verse 4 yet i want to look at abraham he now is asked to do something that he absolutely cannot explain i mean we thought it took faith before to live the life abraham lived this is going to take a whole other level of faith but abraham doesn't argue with god he doesn't ask for an alternative course of action is that abraham gets up saddles his ass takes the the two young servants takes isaac takes wood takes fire takes a knife and starts moving i say god bring us to this kind of faith verse 4 then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place of far off and abraham said unto his young men abide here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder in worship and come again to you we've talked about this scripture so many times but this is a proclamation of abraham's faith in the promise of god because abraham is not disbelieving or doubting god one iota and neither is abraham reasoning in a way but abraham knows that god said in isaac shall thy seed be called that this is isaac it has to be isaac he's come to the place to have confidence in god's word and not to mix it with his own plan now he's not trying to find a way to save isaac he's not even intent on saving isaac we know because hebrews tells us that he was determined to slay isaac he is not coming up with an alternative plan he is taking god at his word so now he's got two words that look like they contra they're contradictory to one another slay thy son but in isaac shall thy seed be called so now he's going up to moriah to do what god told him to do to slay isaac amen but but when he goes to moriah and when he leaves the two young men he says you stay here the lad and i will go worship and come again to you who's going to go worship the lad and i who's going to come again the latter i hold your place here and turn to the book of hebrews hebrews chapter 11 verse 17. hebrews 11 17. by faith abram of abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him and a figure abraham's mind was not on getting out of this abraham was not working an alternative plan abraham believed god's word so much that if god asked him to kill the very product of the promise he believed that god was able to raise him from the dead in the way that he had received him in a type abraham was so sure of god he wasn't now because god told him to go and offer isaac as an accurate sacrifice he wasn't then going well maybe isaac isn't the one maybe i misunderstood god no he heard god right he knew isaac was the one so hebrews tells us that what was going on in abraham's mind was that abraham said this is the one this is the word of god now abraham is not adding anything to the word of god he won't manhandle it anymore before he would manhandle it he would say now you go into the promised land and you stay in the land where i told you this is what brother bam tells us but he says but surely god won't let me stay here when there's a famine god would understand i got to go and eat that's manhandling the word he says out of your bowels shall come your seed and then sarah comes up with this plan you know hagar and it's legal and he said yeah i agree with you and it would still be coming out of my mouth that's still the word okay we'll go with this plan amen which was not the plan of god but he went with that plan anyway what was he doing he was adding his own interpretation to the word and it produced an ishmael but now we get to this time and this is the hardest test of all harder than leaving kenfo harder than leaving country harder amen than staying in a land that's under famine this is the hardest test of all but this is why abraham is the father of the faith because he's come to a perfect faith slay the very product of the promise if that's what you want that's what i'll do come on son let's go let's go what's he thinking i don't know exactly what he's thinking but hebrews tells us he had thoughts and he was thinking god's able to raise him back up so that means abraham was fully intent and obeying the word of god but he never doubted the original promise what an impossible situation intellectually god has got abraham to a point where abraham's just going to obey and not mix any reasoning into his obedience let's go back to genesis 22. 22-6 and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together amen i i believe it like this like brother marcus was saying about the manifestation of the third pool you'll say something and not even know what you're saying we know by hebrews this is not the plan abraham was thinking abraham was not thinking god will provide another lamb abraham was thinking god can raise him up but when a son asked him the question it wasn't abraham's thinking but something came out of abraham's mouth and what came out of abraham's mouth was the spoken word and in the walking in obedience walking in perfect obedience there was a need abraham had his own thought on how god will work the plan but he wasn't doubting the word but yet he had his own thought on how god will do this but as they're walking along isaac asks a question father the wood father the fire where is the lamb he said god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering and that is exactly what god did showing that abraham was speaking the word of god amen this was the third poll this was the spoken word when did it come it came when he was walking in obedience to god without questions and it wasn't abraham's thinking it just came out of abraham's mouth god will provide himself a burn offering verse 9 and they came to the place which god had told him of and abram built an altar there and laid the wooden order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abram abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abram abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fierce god seeing that thou hast not withheld thy son thy only son from me and abraham lifted up his lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of the place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen god saw god knew the obedience of the man and god provided a plan abraham this time did not have to come up with his own plan abraham this time did not have to figure it out on his own he didn't compromise it he didn't sidestep it he didn't manhandle it he just obeyed it and god supernaturally provided what abraham needed so abraham could keep the word when abraham spoke brother branham said he said they were up there gathering stones for an altar they looked all over the place on that mountaintop there was no ram there he said god created a ram by abraham's spoken word why did god create a ram because god had already given a promise to abraham and god is not going to change the promise god is going to keep the promise he was just testing abraham and now he finally got abraham to the place that abraham was supposed to be but i tell you friends where abraham was is exactly where god foresaw him to be that's where god led him all along i believe with all my heart this bride is going to get to the same kind of faith where she doesn't question she doesn't reason she doesn't sidestep figure another plan leaving a time of famine take extras along she's just going to do exactly what he said and she's going to believe that somehow he'll work it out how's he going to work it out you know abraham had to give up so much to go to mount moriah he had to give up his emotions his thoughts his desires his sign his reputation amen brother bannon tells us all the time about mo about abraham telling everybody i'm going to have a son and they laughed at him and they mocked him hey father of nations where's your son at and now the fulfillment of the promise comes abraham is vindicated abraham is justified and god tells him to take that very thing and slay it he's giving up everything to keep the word of god and in the line of duty god provides this power of the spoken word and a supernatural ram to take his place we want to see supernatural things but we're still trying to go to egypt to get bread we want to see supernatural things but we're still coming up with hagar plans to bring about if we want to see god work supernaturally we've got to stick with god's word and let god be responsible for keeping his worth abraham now is not feeling responsible to bring the promise to pass abraham has passed all of that i said god help me get past all of that i don't want to have to feel responsible amen for healing somebody's body you're the only healer that there is i don't want to feel responsible amen for trying to make the promise work out and make things the way you said they would be i just want to trust in you and you work those out i want to get beyond those things and i want to come to the place where we don't have to take care of those things god will take care of him all i got to do is stand on his word and say god you said i don't know what else to do elijah he could do everything god told him to do on mount carmel i mean he could he could slay the animal he could put the word in order or the the wooden order he could slay the beast he could cover it all with water he could do everything like he saw the vision do but he could never make that fire come down from heaven that was up to god and all he could do was say god i've done this i've done all of this at thy bidding and then he had to wait moses when he took the rod amen god told him cast that rod down now take it up it became a serpent and then it became back to a stick he goes and cast it down and now janice and jamboree's they throw down their rods there's nothing else moses could do he couldn't pretend he couldn't come up with plan b he couldn't make excuses for them having snakes all he could do was brother bam said he did what god told him to do all he could do is stand by and wait for god and what god did is allowed his snake to swallow up the other two and he picked it up and he had his rod plus their rods abraham couldn't do that all abraham could do was keep the word listen there's a multitude of things that you and i can't do i mean we if we just sit down together and we started listening them heal your body save your children i mean what else do we want to list what is it we can't do but the one thing we can do is by his grace we can say amen to the word and say god line me to that word and i'm going to obey it amen not any extra thinking not any extra plan but i'll just take you at your word and if i take you at your word it's no longer my responsibility now it's your responsibility abraham is walking along with the promised son going to kill the promised son he's got a dilemma but he he's not going to worry about it he's just going to do it and his son asked him what about this land what about the sacrifice he said god will provide us a sacrifice no that's not what he said god will provide himself a sacrifice god's the one who gave the promise god's the one who has to keep the promise listen we didn't make up the message that was from the mind of god it is the word of god we don't have to keep it god will keep it we don't have to bring it to pass we have to believe it and walk in it and he'll keep it amen god will provide for himself everything that he needs to bring his purpose to pass it's not up to us it's up to us to receive it to believe it and to obey it it's up to god to take care of the rest and if you're having trouble obeying it he knows how to move you because he won't lose you now let's look at verse 15. and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thy seed is the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seat shall possess the gate of his enemy and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice listen god after abraham did this action this obedience on mount moriah god come down supernaturally and confirmed it again and said because you obeyed my voice i this i this i this and i this listen that was not a new covenant that was not a new promise god was reconfirming the old promise nothing changed in the mind of god god wasn't waiting for abraham to obey god was just god was blessing abraham for his obedience and said i swore of myself i will do this i will do this i will do this and i will do this god was so pleased with abraham he was once again confirming his promise but it wasn't a new promise it was the original promise brother branham says in the message expectation he said now we find out that the child never arrived until 25 years later but instead of growing weak because it never happened the first month he grew stronger all the time because his expectation was greater if sarah was one month older it'd be one month greater than the expectations because god kept his word it would be a lot better for her to have the child at 100 years old than it was at 60 years old see what i mean it was a greater miracle all the time and he never grew weak but he grew stronger all the time now we are the children of abraham the bible said so we being dead in christ take on abraham's seed and our heirs according to the promise we are heirs of the promise with abraham because abraham was given the promise now if we are his heirs with abraham then we are abraham's children and the same faith that abraham have we have ourselves that when god makes a promise just know it's going to happen it can't do anything else and the message possessing thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy you go through a test god tests you like he did abraham he test abraham's seed after him and now the reason we don't possess the gate of the enemy the reason there's so much among us is because that we're not able to stand the test and let me tell you something the test of the word is right he goes on further in the same message he says now abraham the promise is made to abraham and to a seat after him now god give his promise to abraham of his seed would possess the gate of his enemy after he had tried abraham tested abraham now after the testing comes abraham had already been converted we would call it from paganism unto god and then god had given him a sign of the holy ghost the circumcision then after the circumcision then come the testing time listen if it happened to abraham it will happen to us god's going to test us what's he looking for he's looking for perfect faith he's looking for somebody that that has walked with god that god's led that god's establishing the truth that'll just say god you said it i don't know how you work it out but i'm trusting in you i we we come to this position where we were gonna have somebody in our family tested for covet and i i knew what that means i know if it's a positive test then there's quarantines and difficulties and difficulties for everybody else but i i finally got to the place where i said god it is what it is i'm in your hands you know i've got a trip coming up to uganda i want to make sure for the sake of brother abraham and his family that that we're there i want to do all that i can but at the end of the day it has to be god i can only do so much i want to be here faithful in my post of duty to preach when it's my time to preach and to do what god's called me to do but there's only so much i can do it already was what it was i could act like an ostrich and stick my head in the sand and say everything's fine but that's not really honest but i could commit myself to god and say god it is what it is and i'm trusting in you i want to stay in my post of duty i want to go to uganda i want to do what you've called me to do but god if you have another plan then it's up to you i can't change anything it is what it is and i tell your friends that's not the way i was five six seven eight years ago i would have tried to think well if i don't know i could answer this way and you were the same way [Laughter] we're in this boat together years ago i would have tried to say but for the ministry say and because of this and because of that i need to make sure this and i need and and it's better not to know listen i'm not going to go get a test every time i sneeze but if i've got a real concern if there's a real issue and god puts it on my heart then i need to be honest and responsible i told my wife there's six of us in the family if we stayed home every time somebody sneezed and coughed then forget see i'll see you guys in a couple of years i mean it's not going to happen that's not what i'm talking about but i'm talking about when you lose your sense of taste and you say i had a stupid covet i don't care god will take care of me i'm going to the fellowship anyways that's not faith friends that's not integrity that's not honesty that's just not right it's a bravado it's a brashness that has rooted more in fear than in faith more in pride than in faith but god allows these things we can't change them what can you do about it at some point you say god i'm in your hands if you allow it you allow it and i'll trust that it's right i can't see how it's right i feel like i'm supposed to do this i'm supposed to do this but it's up to you we you know for me i made that decision so easy how did i make that decision so easy because two years ago it was really hard decision to make think covets of the devil god allowed it there's things that he's working out of us and when this one's done another something will come may not be a sickness may not be this it may be something it may be a financial disaster it may it may be a natural disaster who knows what it'll be but god is perfecting the faith in his bride until she quits trying to take care of herself she quits playing games she quits going to egypt she quits taking a long lot she stops having hagar until she finally gets the place to say lord i'm standing here your god i'm here what you want is what i want what you allow i accept what you change only you can change it i can't change it i think god is bringing us to maturity friends so that the faith that's in us becomes the thing that dominates our lives a real faith a steady faith a solid faith not a bravado not a not an arrogance not a pride not a spitting at the devil that you can't listen you can't spit on the devil he's a spirit he's invisible you can't spit on you can't stomp on his head he doesn't have a physical head for you to stomp on amen at some point you have to say god's in control i believe the word of god and god i'm taking you at your word and i'm trusting you to do what only you can do at some point you have to say god i'm in your hands not mine if you don't protect me i'm not protected if you don't feed me i'm not fed if you don't if you don't provide for me then i'll go without but i can't i can't make my own mind i'll just follow your word and trust in you i'm not going to take care of myself anymore with my own end to life i'm going to stand on your word and watch you keep your word the bride has got to come to a higher level of faith and that higher level of faith is not not i mean look at abraham when he comes to the perfection of faith he's not casting mountains into the sea god says slay your son he gets up and starts packing a donkey come on son what are you going to do we're going to go kill my son what is this this is perfect faith but but isn't he the one that god told you that the seed your seed shall be in isaac and isaac shall there see be called yeah he's the one what do you think maybe god has changed his mind or something no he's the one then what are you going to do i'm going to go kill him but you said he's the one how do you reconcile these two thoughts it's not up to me to reconcile these two thoughts it's up to me to obey the word of god god will reconcile these two thoughts come on let's go dad what are we doing we're going to make a sacrifice where's the lamb god will provide for himself a lamb and that became the spoken word that created a created lamb this to me this is just me this to me is perfect faith it wasn't a public show it didn't bring any kind of accolades or merits to abraham it wasn't there to prove anything to anybody else it was abraham alone with his son on a mountaintop and god did the supernatural because he believed his word to me this is perfect faith and when i read this story i can see myself all the way through i can see the missteps i can see the immaturity i can see the wrong idea about how the word will be accomplished i can see i can see when you look back and i can see myself friends abraham had a few i have multitudes of those stories but i said god if you can bring me this far would you bring me to this kind of perfect faith where i can just humbly follow after you and watch you do the supernatural and watch you do what i can't do can we finally come to the place where we have confidence in god and just in god are we always going to be mixing this confidence in god with confidence in ourselves say it's time to say humanly naturally physically i can't do it but if i'll just keep believing him and keep stepping where he says step and keep walking where he says walk he'll do everything he promised to do what a journey we're on friends for me this is just me i feel god saying grow up chad it's time to quit acting childish time to quit shaking your fist at the world and just trust in the word of god it's not you know it's not even our job to explain everything we can't explain everything in the message it's not our job to defend the message we can't defend the message it's not our job to make everybody see we can't make everybody see what can we do we can we can believe what god shows us and act accordingly and if we can keep believing what god chose and acting accordingly he'll take care of the rest and i just believe that more than i ever did before i want to read this last quote and as i read that musicians if you'd like to come brother john if you'll make your way up in the message the god of this evil age he says we find now this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve now she is not that type of woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word amen eve was tried the first church age was tried the nation of israel was tried amen this bride will be tried shall be tried by the word and shall stand by the word not her own not her own anything she'll stand by the word i mean let's all stand i said god make me faithful faith isn't what i used to think faith was faith i used to think faith was like being really loud and screaming at the devil i mean i was raised pentecostal so i mean forgive me i started off as a baby faith faith for me was rhetoric but i had a lot of strong rhetoric because down inside i had a little fear and the more you're afraid the louder your rhetoric becomes but what i've experienced is the more faith i have the quieter i get about things the more i believe god's going to work it out the less i fret over it the less i talk about it and the less i shout at the devil i hope you understand what i'm saying i want to have mature faith i want to have a faith that's dependable that doesn't leave me that's not dependent on me working something out but something that just solidly laying there said he's taken care of me before he'll take care of me again he's called me for a purpose and nothing's going to happen to me till his purpose is finished nothing can happen to me unless it first crosses his desk and i believe it and i'm going to accept what comes and believe that he'll bring me out of it all because the scripture says many are the afflictions of the righteous but he is the one that delivers them out of them all so i just believe god and i want to believe him more and i say god give us this kind of faith that abraham had and i believe that's the kind of faith he's bringing us to friends say when we look back and say yep i did that and i did that and i did that but he brought me back out of that he he brought me through that he brought me to where i am today and i'm going to look forward to say god you've kept me there you'll keep me here i'm going to keep walking and trusting in you amen these things that are happening in the world they're only there to perfect the bride all of these things that we face and all the things that are going on i mean if you watch the news you can see all kinds of things are happening everywhere i just found out that there's like five or six nations that they're shutting down travel to the southern part of africa and they stopped in malawi and mozambique guess what's just above allah malawi mozambique uganda [Applause] what can you do about it i can scream at the devil but god's in control i'll tell you the thing that i want most is not to go to uganda is to come home from uganda i would like to have a guarantee that i'm coming home but i believe god called me there because of the circumstance and i believe he'll get me home it's not a plane it'd be a boat be a train but i believe i just trust in god the world is in such a chaos you could make travel plans one day they could be interrupted the next you could be somewhere and borders could shut down but you know what when all of that happened before god could took care of everybody and he'll do it again we can't operate by fear we have to trust in the lord if we are who we believe we are and he is who we believe he is then we have to act like it i say for me it's time to grow up and start acting like him quit running around when things happen it's time to quiet down and say all is well all is well everything is under control i'm trusting in god man let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the privilege lord of gathering together we thank you god for your word and for the picture that you painted for us in your word god i thank you personally i thank you for the life of abraham i thank you god that you wrote everything in the bible the way you wrote it so that i could see a true picture because if all i had was an account in hebrews i wouldn't understand how you could work with me but because you wrote it out in the book of genesis and showed us the missteps the wrong thinking the wrong actions lord i've got more confidence than ever that what you did for brother abraham you can do for me he's the father of the faith by faith i'm a seed of abraham the way you guided him you can guide me lord i'm so thankful for your word i pray god that you would just purge out of me all of the the selfishness lord all of the self-preservation all of the wrong ideas and wrong concept purge it out of me lord and let me just see myself in your hand in every circumstance i'm in your hand through every trial i'm in your hand lord everything that comes and goes i'm in your hand lord let me have confidence in that and quit lord acting and reacting in the flesh but lord let me stay spiritual and see that you're in control of it all god these times have been hard but god worst times are coming god trained us through these things to be able to stand in these hours of temptation and trial may we stand with your word and your word alone no human effort no human reasoning no human strength no will of our own no self-preservation but let us just stand and say god i trust you here show yourself mighty on our behalf again we love you lord we commit ourselves into your hands we thank you for your provision and how you've protected us and taking care of us through it all we ask that you would bless us as we go from here maybe we walk on this earth in confidence lord that you're watching over us like you watched over abraham and every step we take is not outside of your sight and when needed you'll come down and you'll move things along like you did for abraham let us walk forward with this confidence and this joy in our hearts that all is well and you're working your plan and we're quickly coming to the finish line of that plan lord manifest yourself through your bride in this last day we commit ourselves into you in jesus christ's name we pray amen when we come to genesis 22 for me what's on display greater than anything is preeminence who was having the preeminence in genesis 22 god was having the preeminence we know god's had a great plan and threefold the threefold purpose is all about preeminence preeminence in a man he got that in christ jesus
