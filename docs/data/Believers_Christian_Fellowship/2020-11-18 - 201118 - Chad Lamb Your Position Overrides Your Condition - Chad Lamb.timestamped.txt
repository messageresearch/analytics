[4:04] [Applause]
[4:13] hallelujah praise the lord it's good to
[4:16] be here this evening with you good to
[4:17] see you
[4:18] let's take our bibles while we're
[4:20] standing and turn to first john chapter
[4:22] four
[4:23] we'll read this scripture and then we'll
[4:25] let you have your seats
[4:29] look at first john chapter 4
[4:33] verse 4.
[4:39] amen first john 4 and 4
[4:43] year of god little children and have
[4:45] overcome them
[4:46] because greater is he that is in you
[4:49] than he that is in the world
[4:51] it's good to be reminded of that right
[4:53] now let's just bow our heads and pray
[4:56] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[4:59] how
[4:59] one scripture can be so encouraging lord
[5:02] one phrase lord lift it out of your word
[5:04] can just lift our spirits
[5:05] because we're connected to that word we
[5:07] are part of that word it's our
[5:09] identification
[5:10] lord we pray now lord that as you come
[5:13] on the scene and break the word of life
[5:14] to us lord that you would open our eyes
[5:16] to see
[5:17] give us hearts to perceive and receive
[5:18] all that you have for us
[5:20] have preeminence among us take this gift
[5:22] and this vessel for your glory
[5:24] feed your sheep lord tonight as we've
[5:26] come expecting we've come hungry
[5:28] we've come desiring lord more of you
[5:31] lord i know you won't disappoint lord
[5:33] i know you won't disappoint we look to
[5:35] you for all things
[5:37] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[5:40] can all be seated
[5:43] amen i'd like for a subject tonight
[5:47] just to take for this title your
[5:50] position
[5:50] overrides your condition if you just
[5:53] write that down because i think that
[5:55] would be something that we should
[5:56] remember
[5:57] all the time that your position
[6:00] overrides your condition
[6:02] and as we go on to become very evident
[6:04] what we mean by that uh
[6:06] but but brother vamp says in adoption
[6:08] part 1 from 1960 he said we can never
[6:10] rightly be able to have faith
[6:12] until positionally we know what we are
[6:15] amen let's turn to ephesians chapter 2.
[6:21] i'd like to read another couple
[6:22] scriptures but ephesians chapter 2
[6:30] and verse 4 ephesians 2 and 4.
[6:35] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[6:37] great love wherewith he loved us
[6:39] even when we were dead in sins had he
[6:41] quickened us together with christ
[6:43] by grace are you saved and hath raised
[6:46] us up together and made us sit
[6:48] together in heavenly places in christ
[6:50] jesus
[6:51] so we know that we have already been
[6:54] lifted up
[6:54] and seated in heavenly places in christ
[6:57] jesus
[6:58] and brother graham tells us heavenly
[6:59] places oh how i wish i had time
[7:01] here i've got it mark right here in my
[7:03] bible about heavenly places what is
[7:05] heavenly places
[7:06] heavenly places just for a moment is the
[7:08] believer's position
[7:10] in christ see where the believer
[7:13] stands in christ in heavenly places
[7:16] so what is my heavenly place is it's my
[7:19] position in christ
[7:20] and and i'd like to i would like for
[7:23] just the
[7:24] to make the point if you'll allow me to
[7:25] make the point it's
[7:27] he's not talking about heavenly places
[7:31] like so many times and a humanistic idea
[7:34] is i've been in heavenly places meaning
[7:36] i've had an emotionally high experience
[7:38] or i felt really good or i was really
[7:41] lifted up and my emotions are in
[7:42] excitement and all that
[7:44] amen this transcends excitement amen
[7:47] this goes beyond
[7:48] feelings amen your position in christ in
[7:50] heavenly places
[7:51] is secure on your lowest day when you
[7:54] feel worthless and no good like you
[7:56] failed christ
[7:57] and you're you're a miserable christian
[7:58] in the weakest and the lowest that there
[8:00] can be
[8:00] and how could he choose you because you
[8:02] failed him so much your position in
[8:04] christ is still secure
[8:07] so we're in heavenly places not when we
[8:09] feel good we're in heavenly places
[8:12] because we've been lifted up and
[8:13] quickened when we were dead in
[8:14] trespasses and sin he has quickened us
[8:16] up together with him
[8:17] and we're in heavenly places in christ
[8:19] jesus
[8:21] the new birth places us solidly by
[8:23] revelation in this position
[8:25] and nothing will take us out of that
[8:27] position
[8:29] so we've got to make sure that that
[8:32] our position is secured by revelation
[8:35] not by emotion
[8:37] because our feelings and emotions change
[8:39] but we got to catch the revelation of
[8:41] our position in christ
[8:42] amen in our position in christ is secure
[8:46] and transcends our emotion amen
[8:49] so you know
[8:52] somebody can catch you when you're not
[8:55] well when you're distressed when you're
[8:56] upset
[8:57] when you're crying and tearful and say
[8:59] how are you doing you say i'm fine i'm
[9:01] in heavenly places
[9:03] in christ jesus on my low day i'm in
[9:06] heavenly places on my high day i'm in
[9:08] heavenly places
[9:09] in christ jesus and how can you say such
[9:12] a thing you can't say it by
[9:13] intellectualism you can't say it by an
[9:15] emotionalism
[9:16] you can only make that statement by
[9:18] faith in the word of god
[9:20] by a revelation of your position in
[9:22] christ
[9:25] because so many times
[9:29] so many times we sabotage our own faith
[9:32] by our word and our testimony
[9:36] how are you i'm horrible
[9:39] [Laughter]
[9:41] how are you i'm horrible terrible my
[9:43] life is a mess everything's a wreck
[9:46] but that doesn't sound like what the
[9:47] word says the word says you're in
[9:48] heavenly places in christ
[9:50] jesus amen
[9:53] now you can say you know what all around
[9:56] me is trouble
[9:58] my flesh is in trouble my emotions are
[10:01] distressed
[10:02] but i am in heavenly places in christ
[10:04] jesus
[10:05] my position is secure
[10:09] um right now i just want to skip to a
[10:12] scripture
[10:12] i just feel to skip around this a little
[10:14] bit and i shouldn't even say anything
[10:16] because you don't even know i'm skipping
[10:17] around so that was just for me not for
[10:18] you
[10:19] so let's go to luke chapter 10.
[10:23] luke chapter 10 i want to take a look at
[10:26] some scriptures and i love the way jesus
[10:29] speaks the word
[10:31] in a way that may cause us to change
[10:34] maybe a paradigm shift maybe our
[10:36] thinking sometimes is wrong
[10:38] in luke chapter 10 verse 19
[10:42] we know that the seventy went out two by
[10:43] two into the city's round about to
[10:45] preach the kingdom of god is coming
[10:47] has come and they did miracles and they
[10:49] come back and they testified
[10:51] and jesus says to them in verse 19 and
[10:53] behold i give unto you power to tread on
[10:55] serpents and scorpions
[10:57] and over all the power of the enemy and
[10:59] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[11:03] so so when when jesus gives this
[11:06] statement to them
[11:07] it's a statement of invincibility
[11:11] does that sound right we'll read it
[11:13] again
[11:15] i've given you power to tread on
[11:16] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[11:18] power of the enemy
[11:19] and nothing shall by any means hurt you
[11:22] so it's a statement of invincibility
[11:26] and if we if we misunderstand what jesus
[11:29] is saying
[11:31] then all of a sudden we can believe that
[11:34] that
[11:34] if something would harm us in the flesh
[11:37] or trouble
[11:38] us in the spirit in the an emotional
[11:40] realm
[11:41] that that it would hurt us physically it
[11:43] would hurt us
[11:44] emotionally that somehow we don't have
[11:46] this kind of power
[11:50] right but i would say that would be a
[11:52] misunderstanding of the scripture
[11:53] because we know the disciples were hurt
[11:56] they were killed they were stoned they
[11:58] were chased from city to city
[12:00] i mean just look at the apostle paul's
[12:01] life and he said nothing by shall any
[12:03] means hurt you
[12:04] when jesus says nothing shall by any
[12:06] means hurt you he
[12:08] must mean something different than what
[12:10] we would intellectually think he means
[12:12] by that statement
[12:14] and just to show this point let's go
[12:16] over to chapter 21
[12:18] because i don't want you to think i'm
[12:19] too far off the mark
[12:21] chapter 21 verse 16.
[12:25] so i think maybe invincibility isn't
[12:28] what we
[12:28] think invincibility is because this is
[12:31] an invincible army that's marching forth
[12:33] today
[12:34] but invincibility may it may not be
[12:39] the way we think it is let's look at
[12:41] luke 21 verse 16
[12:44] and you shall be betrayed both by
[12:46] parents and brethren
[12:47] and kinsfolk and friends and some of you
[12:49] shall shall they cause to be put into
[12:52] to death and you should be hated of all
[12:54] men for my name's sake let's stop there
[12:57] so now he's telling the same group that
[12:59] he said i give you power over scorpions
[13:01] and serpents and over all the power of
[13:02] the devil nothing shall by any means
[13:04] hurt you
[13:05] he's speaking to some of the same
[13:06] disciples
[13:08] and he says you shall be betrayed amen
[13:12] some of you
[13:12] shall they calls to be put to death and
[13:15] you shall be hated
[13:16] of all men for my name's sake look at
[13:19] the name
[13:20] next sentence but there shall not a hair
[13:22] of your head
[13:23] perish well that sounds like an oxymoron
[13:27] that is a complicated statement
[13:29] they're going to persecute you they're
[13:31] going to hate you and some of you
[13:32] they'll kill
[13:33] but they'll not hurt one hair of your
[13:35] head so apparently not harming one hair
[13:38] of your head
[13:39] is different than what we think it is in
[13:41] this flesh because he's telling you
[13:44] nothing shall perish you've got another
[13:45] body coming your place is secure
[13:47] you'll be in the kingdom you'll be on
[13:49] the millennium you'll have a glorified
[13:50] body
[13:51] because for god everything is now amen
[13:54] there's no
[13:55] there's no then and now everything is
[13:57] now he knows their position is secure
[13:59] amen nothing that they have is going to
[14:02] be lost
[14:04] every brother branham i mean they they i
[14:06] think it was brother bram's wife said
[14:08] uh you're losing your hair he said i
[14:09] haven't lost the one
[14:12] amen same thing as this scripture
[14:16] you can look with your eyes and say his
[14:17] hair is gone and he says i haven't lost
[14:19] the one
[14:22] and she said well where are they he said
[14:23] where were they before i got them
[14:25] that's where they are so you see
[14:28] sometimes we get these statements and
[14:31] invincibility and power over this and
[14:34] nothing might shall be any means hurt
[14:35] you but then he's
[14:36] talking about a life of suffering and
[14:38] persecution and
[14:39] rejection and some of you they'll kill
[14:42] but not one hair of your head shall
[14:44] perish amen maybe maybe just maybe to me
[14:47] when god is speaking of invincibility
[14:49] when god is speaking of security
[14:51] when god is speaking of no harm maybe
[14:54] he's talking about your
[14:55] overall condition in the grand scheme of
[14:57] things
[14:59] because nothing's going to hurt you
[15:01] nothing's going to harm you
[15:02] nothing's going to get you out of your
[15:04] position in heavenly places in christ
[15:06] jesus
[15:06] nothing's going to stop your body change
[15:08] nothing's going to stop you from getting
[15:10] the inheritance
[15:11] nothing's going to stop you from
[15:12] overcoming
[15:15] so sometimes we get the wrong idea of
[15:18] christianity and power and invincibility
[15:20] and all of this stuff and and it gets
[15:23] ingrained into our minds and sometimes
[15:25] when we go through
[15:26] difficulties and troubles the same as
[15:28] the disciples would have went to after
[15:30] the departure of christ some of the same
[15:33] afflictions some of the same
[15:35] difficulties some of the same rejections
[15:37] and
[15:38] ailments and sicknesses
[15:43] and the devil comes along and starts to
[15:45] cause us to doubt
[15:46] our position and doubt our promise
[15:49] because we had the wrong idea of
[15:52] invincibility
[15:56] it's the word that's invincible it's the
[15:59] seed that's invincible
[16:00] it's the life on the inside that's
[16:02] invincible
[16:03] we saw that in the life of paul we saw
[16:06] that in the life of peter
[16:07] we saw it in john john the apostle john
[16:11] they tried to kill him they tried to
[16:12] boil him in oil
[16:13] and they boiled him and and he wouldn't
[16:16] burn
[16:18] but when they beheaded david and when
[16:20] they beheaded peter the knife was sharp
[16:22] and the knife was sure and his head
[16:24] rolled off
[16:26] so was john did john have more faith
[16:29] than
[16:30] than paul
[16:33] peter was hung upside down on the cross
[16:35] and crucified
[16:36] amen did did he have less faith than
[16:39] john because john
[16:40] died of old age and he didn't get born
[16:45] you see sometimes we have the wrong idea
[16:47] of what faith is the wrong idea of
[16:49] invincibility the wrong
[16:50] idea of being an overcomer in this age
[16:55] the greatest example we've ever had of
[16:57] overcoming was jesus christ
[16:59] in his body of flesh on this earth
[17:02] and he overcome and how did he overcame
[17:04] he overcame
[17:06] by surrender to the will of the father
[17:09] and that's our overcoming to keep the
[17:11] word
[17:13] so i want that just to be in our minds
[17:16] now brother brahm says here i want to go
[17:18] back to our position heavenly places
[17:21] is our as a believer's position in
[17:23] christ
[17:25] and an adoption he said like i just
[17:27] quoted
[17:28] you can uh you can never rightly be able
[17:31] to have faith
[17:32] into positionally you know what you are
[17:36] and then christ is the mystery of god
[17:37] revealed he says but god's great mystery
[17:40] what the eternal god had as a mystery
[17:43] has now been unfolded in jesus christ
[17:46] then give right down to his church
[17:48] what was once in god's mind is now in
[17:50] the body of christ
[17:53] what was in god's mind is now in the
[17:56] body of christ
[17:58] where is the body of christ it's on
[17:59] earth
[18:01] it's the believers it's the elect seed
[18:03] amen so now what was in his mind the
[18:05] revelation the secret the mystery
[18:07] and what was in god's mind is now in the
[18:09] body of christ jesus making love to his
[18:12] church his bride
[18:13] whispering secrets to her you know how
[18:16] you tell your wife things you know the
[18:18] little girl you're going to marry you
[18:19] love her so much you just tell her the
[18:20] secrets and get her up next to you
[18:22] and and love you and everything you know
[18:24] how it is that's what god christ is
[18:26] doing to the church
[18:27] he is letting her know the secrets just
[18:29] the secrets
[18:30] not these flirters i mean his wife all
[18:33] right now look
[18:34] but by having the revelation of his
[18:38] secret
[18:38] made known to them by his grace so he's
[18:42] rolling up his wife and he's making love
[18:44] to his wife
[18:44] not the flirters not everybody out there
[18:46] but just his predestinated bride
[18:49] he's pulling up to his side and he's
[18:50] whispering to her the secrets
[18:52] amen why because revealing himself to
[18:55] her through the secrets by the opening
[18:57] of the seals
[18:58] and revealing her to the great mystery
[19:00] of god
[19:02] that that revelation and that great
[19:04] mystery when he reveals
[19:06] christ when he reveals himself to her
[19:09] she is included in the mystery
[19:11] she is included in the secret and so
[19:14] when he's whispering love secrets to her
[19:16] ear
[19:16] he is positionally placing her within
[19:19] himself
[19:20] in the word and so that
[19:23] love secret that he's giving not to
[19:24] everybody but only to his wife
[19:26] amen is the very thing that is revealing
[19:28] to her what she is
[19:30] her position so that she can have the
[19:32] right kind of faith
[19:33] and i would say in this day it's
[19:35] impossible to have the right kind of
[19:37] faith in this
[19:38] hour or amen without christ himself
[19:40] whispering the love secrets in your ear
[19:43] because you can never rightly have the
[19:45] right kind of faith amen
[19:46] and until you're positionally placed
[19:50] in christ by the revelation of the
[19:52] mystery is positionally placing you
[19:54] today
[19:55] in his body in your age amen in christ
[20:01] so i want to turn to psalms 27.
[20:06] i'm bouncing around but we'll bounce
[20:08] onto a good spot maybe
[20:11] psalms
[20:18] 27.
[20:28] psalms 27. we'll begin at the beginning
[20:31] but we know brother branham when he
[20:32] started preaching the rapture message
[20:35] he started in this scripture this is his
[20:37] opening scripture
[20:38] and he read the first five verses of
[20:40] psalms and
[20:41] and so so when brother branham comes to
[20:44] open the subject of the rapture that
[20:45] teaches about the rapture
[20:47] he goes to psalms 27 and that was no
[20:50] mistake
[20:52] and and i want to read it together we'll
[20:54] read the first five verses but i want to
[20:55] read more of it here in a little bit
[20:57] the lord is my light and my salvation
[20:59] whom shall i fear the lord is
[21:01] the strength of my life of whom shall i
[21:03] be afraid
[21:05] now listen brother branham when when
[21:08] he's
[21:08] starting with this scripture there's a
[21:09] reason he's starting with the scripture
[21:12] he he is he is he knows the conditions
[21:15] of the rapture
[21:16] he knows the atmosphere around the
[21:18] rapture he's going to preach the rapture
[21:20] and as he preaches the rapture he's
[21:21] going to start to show us that the lord
[21:23] himself shall descend with a shout
[21:25] with a voice with a trump and he's
[21:28] saying he does
[21:29] all of this while he's descending the
[21:30] lord himself descends
[21:32] amen with a shout what was a shout amen
[21:34] it was a message to gather the bride
[21:37] and brother showing that this that that
[21:40] under the shout the rapture cycle has
[21:42] begun
[21:43] there was a rapture taking place that
[21:45] there's a rapture going on
[21:46] amen but he's setting the conditions for
[21:48] the rapture in psalms 27
[21:52] because if we don't understand if we
[21:55] don't understand
[21:56] what he's doing why he's doing what he's
[21:58] doing it looks like he reads the
[22:00] scriptures
[22:01] out of psalms 27 then skips context and
[22:04] goes
[22:04] over uh the first thessalonians first he
[22:07] goes to peter and talks about scoffers
[22:08] arising and then that day
[22:10] saying everything remains the same and
[22:12] we've got those scoffers still today
[22:14] that say
[22:14] you claim the rapture's on but
[22:16] everything's the same
[22:18] i'm looking for something to happen but
[22:19] it's happening friends it's happening
[22:21] day by day
[22:22] it's happening so those are the two
[22:25] opening scriptures he tells you
[22:27] there's a condition for this in psalms
[22:28] 27 and then there's going to be scoffers
[22:30] saying
[22:31] amen where is the promise of his coming
[22:32] for everything remains the same as it's
[22:34] always been
[22:36] and they're missing it and then he goes
[22:39] down to the
[22:40] uh thessalonians and he goes to the lord
[22:42] himself shall descend with a shout with
[22:44] the voice with the trumpet
[22:45] and then he starts laboring on that and
[22:47] he's talking about that and he doesn't
[22:48] come back and address
[22:50] why he opened with psalms 27.
[22:53] but i think for us it's evident when
[22:55] he's when you begin to read that
[22:57] he's showing you the conditions
[23:00] and the time of the rapture the lord is
[23:03] my light
[23:03] and my salvation whom shall i fear
[23:07] the lord is the strength of my life of
[23:09] whom shall i be afraid
[23:11] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[23:13] foes come upon me to eat up my flesh
[23:15] they stumbled and fell though a host
[23:18] shouldn't camp against me my heart shall
[23:20] not fear
[23:21] the war shall rise against me and this
[23:23] will i be
[23:24] confident one thing have i desired of
[23:27] the lord that i will seek after
[23:29] that that i will seek after that i may
[23:31] dwell in the house of the lord all the
[23:32] days of my life to behold the beauty of
[23:34] the lord
[23:35] and to inquire in his temple for in the
[23:37] time of trouble he shall hide me
[23:40] in his pavilion and the secret of his
[23:42] tabernacle
[23:44] shall he shall he hide me he shall set
[23:47] me up
[23:48] upon a rock brotherhood comes along
[23:53] knowing where he's going he's going to
[23:55] talk about the rapture the secret
[23:57] catching away
[23:58] amen the thing that all christendom has
[24:00] been looking for for 2000 years he
[24:02] begins to speak on it but he
[24:04] starts with such a uh knowing what we
[24:06] know now it makes sense but
[24:08] but not understanding he starts with
[24:10] such an odd spot
[24:12] he starts saying we're gonna talk about
[24:13] the rapture i mean the rapture is
[24:15] i mean it's the rapture is the the
[24:17] release the rapture is the freedom the
[24:19] rapture is the victory the rapture is
[24:21] the overcoming
[24:22] and that's the true but what is the
[24:24] atmosphere of the rapture
[24:25] what is he doing in the rapture he is
[24:28] creating a pavilion he is creating a
[24:30] tabernacle he's creating a secret place
[24:32] amen where you can go amen in a time of
[24:36] trouble so you'll have no fear
[24:38] amen he's the light of your salvation he
[24:40] is your light whom shall you fear
[24:42] though all the enemies gather about all
[24:44] the forces of hell
[24:45] there's been a place provided up upon a
[24:48] rock
[24:48] which a rock is a revelation
[24:51] and then the revelation of jesus christ
[24:53] is the rock that the church is founded
[24:55] on
[24:55] and christ is the mystery of god
[24:57] revealed
[24:59] so now in the time of rapture it's a
[25:01] troublesome time
[25:02] amen but he's creating a safe place he's
[25:05] creating a place of security
[25:07] a place of safety in a troublesome time
[25:10] in the rapture cycle and it's up
[25:14] upon a rock on a revelation
[25:17] in his pavilion
[25:20] in the secret of his tabernacle
[25:24] not the outer court not the inner court
[25:27] but the secret of his tabernacle
[25:30] the holy of holies
[25:35] i'm going to go on and read the rest of
[25:36] this brother bam only reads the first
[25:38] five verses but i just would like to
[25:39] read it
[25:40] it says then now shall my head be lifted
[25:42] up above mine enemies round about me
[25:45] therefore will i offer in this
[25:46] tabernacle sacrifices of joy
[25:48] i will sing yeah i sing praises unto the
[25:52] lord
[25:55] david just described
[25:59] earlier in this let's go back to verse
[26:03] two
[26:04] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[26:07] foes come upon me
[26:09] to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[26:12] fell
[26:13] though a host shouldn't camp against me
[26:16] my heart shall not fear
[26:18] the war should rise against me and this
[26:21] will i be confident
[26:23] one thing if i desired of the lord that
[26:25] i will seek after
[26:26] that i may dwell in the house of the
[26:27] lord all the days of my life to behold
[26:29] the beauty of the lord
[26:30] and inquire in his temple for in the
[26:33] time of trouble he shall hide in me
[26:36] in his pavilion and the secret of his
[26:38] tabernacle shall he hide me shall set me
[26:40] up
[26:40] upon a rock and now shall my head be
[26:45] lifted up above mine enemies
[26:48] round about me therefore will i offer in
[26:50] his tabernacle sacrifices of joy
[26:52] i will sing yeah i was singing praises
[26:55] unto the lord
[26:57] in the time of trouble
[27:01] on the rock in the pavilion
[27:05] in the secret of the tabernacle
[27:08] david's head is lifted above his enemies
[27:10] means his understanding is higher than
[27:12] everybody around him his revelation has
[27:16] lifted his head
[27:17] christ has lifted his head his
[27:19] revelation is understanding
[27:20] up above all of us enemies and in that
[27:23] condition
[27:24] all he can do is sing and rejoice and
[27:27] sing praises to the lord
[27:29] you see friends in your position in
[27:32] christ when we understand our position
[27:34] i mean it doesn't matter how many foes
[27:36] how many are encamped how much trouble
[27:38] david was in trouble friends he was in a
[27:40] troublesome time
[27:41] he had enemies all around they wanted to
[27:44] gather around and eat up his flesh
[27:47] but god in that time had created a place
[27:50] on the revelation of jesus christ in the
[27:53] in the pavilion in the secret of his
[27:55] tabernacle he had a place where his head
[27:58] would be lifted above his enemies
[27:59] and in that place david cannot mourn in
[28:02] that place
[28:03] david cannot be gloomy in that place
[28:06] david can only sing praises unto the
[28:08] lord
[28:11] praise god see
[28:15] in the rapture time
[28:16] [Music]
[28:18] in the rapture time it can be a
[28:22] troublesome time
[28:23] [Music]
[28:25] but there's a place of security in the
[28:28] rapture
[28:30] when the world is in trouble and there's
[28:32] trouble all around
[28:33] and the enemies of god would try to take
[28:35] out the servants of god
[28:37] in any way they can any demon i mean
[28:40] you think where do you think the demon
[28:42] guns are trained
[28:47] amen brother branham said when the when
[28:50] the bottomless pit was open and
[28:52] amen those demons come out of the river
[28:54] euphrates he said
[28:56] those hundred or uh two hundred thousand
[28:58] thousand he said where did they go
[28:59] and then did they go to the nomination
[29:01] no they go after the bride
[29:04] so you've got enemies round about that
[29:06] want to eat up your flesh amen
[29:08] you've got foes that would like to
[29:10] destroy you amen
[29:11] but in this time amen in the end time in
[29:14] the harvest time in the rapture
[29:16] time amen when the gates of hell have
[29:18] been open and thousands and thousands of
[29:20] demons have
[29:21] ushered out gunning for the bride amen
[29:23] there's been a secret spot put on a rock
[29:25] that he has lifted his bride into that
[29:27] spot
[29:28] amen and put her head above all the
[29:30] enemies amen more revelation
[29:34] and all she can do is sing
[29:37] and praise his name and rejoice
[29:43] see i want to read a couple scriptures
[29:45] here and then
[29:46] or a couple quotes and then keep keep
[29:48] going and the easter seal
[29:50] says oh if we if we are ordained
[29:54] on that ground if we are ordained to be
[29:55] on that ground like the eagle walking in
[29:57] the chicken's nest
[29:58] if you're ordained on the ground the
[29:59] holy spirit is here to find you
[30:01] and when it finds you you recognize its
[30:03] call and know the hour you're living
[30:05] you know that these things are supposed
[30:07] to happen quickly you're raptured up to
[30:09] meet it
[30:12] and now you're setting in heavenly
[30:14] places in christ jesus
[30:17] oh what a promise what a heavenly father
[30:19] who should give us these things
[30:22] don't keep putting the rapture off in
[30:24] the future
[30:26] we're looking forward to the change in
[30:28] the body
[30:30] but god has already called us up with a
[30:33] shout he has already brought us out of
[30:35] laodicea
[30:36] there's already been a door open in
[30:37] heaven there's already been a voice that
[30:39] says come up higher and then when we
[30:41] heard the eagle scream
[30:42] quickly we were raptured up to meet it
[30:47] there's a position for us said in the
[30:50] rapture
[30:51] message to the church the bride the
[30:53] rapture is a revelation to her
[30:55] it's revealed to her that the revelation
[30:57] the true bride of christ will be waiting
[30:59] for that revelation of the rapture
[31:01] now it is a revelation for the
[31:02] revelation is faith you cannot have
[31:04] revelation without it being faith
[31:06] faith is a revelation because it's
[31:08] something that's revealed to you
[31:09] faith is a revelation faith is something
[31:11] that has been revealed to you like it
[31:13] was to abraham
[31:14] that could call anything contrary to
[31:16] what had been revealed to him as though
[31:17] it wasn't so
[31:19] now faith that's what faith is the
[31:20] revelation of god the church is built
[31:23] upon a revelation
[31:24] the whole entire body so the rapture is
[31:27] a revelation
[31:28] to the bride he says in the rising of
[31:31] the sun
[31:32] because i live you live also speaking to
[31:34] his wife because i live you live also
[31:36] what a resurrection that was
[31:38] and what a resurrection this is to be
[31:41] quickened from the
[31:42] dead to be made alive in christ jesus by
[31:44] god's quickening power
[31:47] so brother branham is telling us amen
[31:50] there's people being raptured up
[31:52] right now amen caught up in the heavenly
[31:54] places amen with a revelation that is
[31:56] seeding them securely
[31:57] in christ jesus there's a resurrection
[32:00] out of dead denominationalism there's a
[32:01] resurrection out of the deadness of the
[32:03] church and then he's bringing back
[32:05] what's he resurrecting he's resurrecting
[32:07] a bride back
[32:10] and we were part of that resurrection we
[32:12] were part of that rapture
[32:15] and so now we find ourselves in psalms
[32:18] 27.
[32:20] when we look at psalms 27
[32:24] i want to i want to look at that in the
[32:27] conditions of the rapture
[32:29] and say the the the only place
[32:34] to overcome is in the secret of the
[32:37] tabernacle
[32:39] the only place to have joy the only
[32:41] place to have victory
[32:42] the only place to overcome is in the
[32:44] secret of the tabernacle
[32:46] because out there are enemies that want
[32:48] to eat his flesh out there there are
[32:49] foes that are gathered around
[32:51] out there is every force that would try
[32:53] to destroy him but the place of
[32:54] rejoicing the place of joy
[32:56] amen the place of security the place of
[32:58] safety is
[33:00] in the pavilion in the secret of the
[33:01] tabernacle up upon the rock
[33:03] and that is our position friends and our
[33:06] position in this rapture cycle
[33:08] transcends our condition
[33:12] our position amen is overriding
[33:15] our condition because it doesn't matter
[33:17] what condition we're in
[33:18] you can be sick you can you can have
[33:20] complications you can have distresses
[33:22] you can have work pressures
[33:24] but your position overrides your
[33:26] condition your conditions should never
[33:28] override your position
[33:30] you can see because there's been a place
[33:32] provided for us because there's been a
[33:34] rock that has been revealed to us in
[33:36] this day
[33:37] the revelation of jesus christ christ
[33:39] the mystery of god revealed
[33:41] opened amen as the seals were open now
[33:43] there's a place
[33:44] up on a rock up above our enemies where
[33:46] our head can be lifted up
[33:48] and then we can go into the pavilion of
[33:50] the lord and to the chambers of the lord
[33:52] into the secret
[33:53] chamber of the lord through the secret
[33:55] place of the tabernacle
[33:57] and in there we have joy and there we
[33:58] have rejoicing and there we have
[34:00] shouting and there we have security and
[34:02] there we have peace
[34:04] and there we're feasting with the lamb
[34:07] feasting on the lamb
[34:09] eating the manna that has been preserved
[34:15] seated with christ jesus in heavenly
[34:17] places
[34:18] but i want to tell you in this day
[34:21] that's the only place to be
[34:24] everywhere else amen will bring distress
[34:26] amen we'll bring stress
[34:28] amen we'll bring depression we'll bring
[34:30] anxiety we'll bring
[34:32] fear
[34:37] i say if god has provided us a place in
[34:40] this rapture cycle
[34:43] then it behooves us to stay in that
[34:46] place
[34:48] and the whole goal of the enemy is to
[34:50] get us to look outside
[34:53] and the war now the struggle is just to
[34:56] stay in the place that's provided
[35:01] brother brahm says in spiritual amnesia
[35:03] you that wants the holy spirit you that
[35:05] wants the experience not an emotional
[35:07] excitement you want the holy ghost the
[35:09] life the germ of life in
[35:10] inside you and you want to get rid of
[35:12] that amnesia that's making you
[35:14] you can't identify yourself you don't
[35:17] know where you stand
[35:18] you don't know what you are let's get
[35:21] rid of it right now
[35:23] there is a new birth here for you a real
[35:25] genuine
[35:26] new birth i don't want any of that old
[35:30] amnesia lingering on anymore
[35:32] i want to know who i am where i am what
[35:35] i'm here for
[35:37] that amnesia means you can't identify
[35:39] yourself
[35:41] amen you don't know your position
[35:47] in modern events made clear by prophecy
[35:49] prophet of god says you're
[35:51] a gene of your father you were in your
[35:54] father
[35:55] yet you had no fellowship with you with
[35:57] you because you was in there
[35:59] but you knew it not and he knew it not
[36:01] but you was manifested
[36:02] that you might that he might fellowship
[36:04] with you and you're being born again
[36:06] you're born of the eternal life and
[36:08] that's the only one form of eternal life
[36:10] and that's god's life
[36:11] zoe the greek word zoe only one form of
[36:13] eternal life
[36:14] then if you are a son of god or a
[36:16] daughter of god you were in god
[36:18] all the time but he knew what bed and
[36:20] time that you'd be planted
[36:22] so now you you're you're made a creature
[36:25] a son of god
[36:27] manifested son or daughter of god to
[36:29] meet the challenge of this hour
[36:31] to vindicate the true and living god of
[36:33] this hour
[36:34] the message that's coming forth in this
[36:36] time
[36:38] i'm going to read that again you you're
[36:40] if you're made a creature a son of god
[36:42] manifest son or daughter of god to meet
[36:44] the challenge
[36:45] of this hour to vindicate the true and
[36:47] living god of this hour
[36:49] the message is coming forth in this time
[36:52] and so you've been placed here you've
[36:55] been placed here for a specific time
[36:57] and you've been placed in a position in
[36:59] this time by the new birth you're in
[37:00] this position
[37:01] that god had created for david that
[37:04] david was talking about in psalms 27
[37:06] and you're here for a purpose you're in
[37:08] a position and you're here to meet the
[37:10] challenge of the hour
[37:13] and
[37:19] there's a couple other things i want to
[37:20] say i'm just trying to ask god to help
[37:23] me to say it right
[37:24] because when i say it wrong it stumbles
[37:26] but i don't want to i don't want to
[37:27] stumble
[37:30] brother bam says in why little bethlehem
[37:33] i don't worship a jew i worship god when
[37:35] i worship jesus
[37:36] christ i don't worship some fiction or
[37:37] some kind of historical something
[37:39] i worship jesus christ the presence of
[37:41] jesus christ right now
[37:43] which is his word that's manifested in
[37:46] this age
[37:48] i hope you we all believe that we all
[37:50] know that but it's those things have to
[37:52] sink
[37:53] deep friends i'm not worshiping some
[37:56] fiction or some kind of historical
[37:58] something
[38:00] i worship jesus christ listen
[38:03] how does he worship jesus christ the
[38:06] presence of jesus christ
[38:08] right now which is his word
[38:11] that's manifest in this age
[38:15] so how are you going to worship jesus
[38:17] christ without worshiping through the
[38:19] word that's manifest in this age
[38:21] the present tense jesus christ
[38:29] he says again and when their eyes were
[38:31] open they knew him
[38:33] would you like to to look took a trip
[38:36] with cleopas and them
[38:37] on the road to emmaus i like to walk
[38:40] with them and it's possible i'm glad to
[38:41] be
[38:42] living today that i can still do the
[38:44] same thing walk with him today just the
[38:45] same as they did then
[38:48] they thought of it the thought of it was
[38:50] how that jesus had risen up from the
[38:52] dead
[38:53] but the sad part of it was some of them
[38:55] who loved him didn't know it
[39:00] jesus says because i live you live also
[39:03] the word is resurrected the word is here
[39:06] amen you can walk with the word and some
[39:08] people have been walking with the word
[39:10] amen and they didn't even know it he's
[39:12] resurrected the word is restored and
[39:15] he's come back in the fullness of the
[39:16] word
[39:17] and some don't even know it
[39:20] it's the same thing today he said now
[39:24] some of them who loved him didn't even
[39:26] didn't know it and that's certainly a
[39:28] picture of today
[39:29] there are so many people who love him
[39:30] who doesn't yet realize that he's alive
[39:34] it's some kind of a history that they
[39:36] have learned in some school
[39:38] in some book of theology some ethical
[39:40] code of ethics that they studied
[39:41] somewhere
[39:42] and jesus is a historical figure to them
[39:45] and yet in the history
[39:46] they love him and don't realize that he
[39:48] is alive with
[39:49] us walking right around with us just as
[39:52] he always did
[39:53] he is here just the same as he ever was
[39:58] how in the manifested word for this age
[40:01] and the message of the hour that's how
[40:04] he's walking around
[40:07] in an anointed ones at the end time says
[40:10] remember david now
[40:11] he was honest sincere trying to do god
[40:14] of work and wasn't ordained to do it
[40:16] they the anointed one but jesus said
[40:18] they're teaching for doctrine the
[40:20] interpretation of scriptures of man
[40:22] see not the word of god not his
[40:24] vindicated word teaching a historical
[40:26] christ sees something that was
[40:29] now see there's nothing wrong with that
[40:32] there's nothing wrong
[40:34] with the historical jesus there's
[40:35] nothing wrong with with the christ that
[40:38] was the rock that followed them through
[40:39] the wilderness
[40:41] there's nothing wrong with the pillar of
[40:43] fire that led them into acts there's
[40:45] nothing wrong
[40:47] with christ that was typed in the ark in
[40:49] noah's day
[40:50] the error was leaving him in history
[40:53] and brother branham preached lifting
[40:55] christ out of history amen
[40:57] because because it's not wrong to
[41:00] believe in that
[41:01] it's wrong to reject him today it's
[41:04] wrong to leave him
[41:05] historical christ
[41:08] and many people will say well i mean
[41:10] he's not dead he's alive
[41:12] amen he he he he's not a dead christ
[41:15] he's not just a god of history
[41:16] he's not just a christ of history he's
[41:18] christ today but you ask him
[41:20] where and they want to put him off
[41:21] sitting in a seat somewhere
[41:23] in another place in another dimension
[41:25] and not realize that he's here
[41:26] he's a present tense jesus christ and
[41:28] you can worship a present tense jesus
[41:30] christ
[41:31] not a historical figure not a historical
[41:33] god but a present tense jesus christ
[41:36] that is here among
[41:37] us what in the manifestation of his word
[41:41] which is what his bride church come back
[41:43] to grain again he's back in the grain
[41:45] it's harvest time it's the restoration
[41:47] of the bride tree it's the promised word
[41:49] for this hour
[41:50] it's the manifestation of the light and
[41:52] the word for this day
[41:53] and it's a present tense jesus christ
[41:56] [Music]
[41:58] and you can worship a present tense
[42:00] jesus christ but there's billions who
[42:02] are worshiping a historical christ
[42:04] and they're missing the present tense
[42:05] jesus christ
[42:07] [Music]
[42:09] amen in the present tense jesus christ
[42:12] amen the revelation is the rapture cycle
[42:15] it's lifting
[42:16] out of denomination it's lifting out of
[42:18] laodicea it's lifting
[42:19] out of man's ideas and lifting us back
[42:22] into heavenly places back in the mind of
[42:24] christ
[42:25] and the revelation of god
[42:31] and that has provided that revelation
[42:33] this message of this hour
[42:35] has provided the secret of the
[42:37] tabernacle
[42:39] it has provided the hiding place up on
[42:41] the rock
[42:42] it has provided the hiding place in the
[42:44] pavilion in christ it has provided the
[42:45] hiding place in the secret of the
[42:47] pavilion in the holy of holies and an
[42:49] invisible union with christ how do i get
[42:52] there
[42:52] amen the word alive today has provided
[42:55] the safety place has provided the place
[42:57] above the heads of your enemies
[43:00] you can't get there without the message
[43:02] of the hour you can't get there without
[43:03] this revelation
[43:04] what rock will you stand on if it's not
[43:06] christ the mystery of god revealed
[43:10] if it's not the seventh seal what rock
[43:12] are you standing on that will lift you
[43:13] above the heads of your enemies
[43:16] the secret place is in christ amen
[43:19] in communion with christ feasting on the
[43:22] lamb as the lamb is in you and you're in
[43:24] him
[43:26] that's the only place of safety it's the
[43:28] only place of security
[43:31] and the only way to get there is through
[43:33] the revealed word of the hour
[43:41] and so saying that
[43:45] you see so many things that are so
[43:47] troubling
[43:49] and friends we're in a troubling time
[43:53] i mean we're in a precarious time where
[43:56] where i've said many times where things
[43:58] that were so solid now don't seem solid
[44:00] anymore
[44:02] things that will seem secure and safe
[44:04] don't seem safe or secure anymore things
[44:08] that were normal are no longer normal
[44:11] you have this sense that anything can
[44:14] happen at any time
[44:16] there's a sense worldwide that that what
[44:18] was so solid now seems so fragile
[44:24] and and it was a false sense of security
[44:28] and if we put our security in the united
[44:31] states government
[44:32] that's a false security
[44:37] says in the message he careth for you
[44:41] we can't look at democracy
[44:45] [Music]
[44:48] if i would have said this during the
[44:49] reagan administration
[44:52] i'd have got run out of message churches
[44:57] we can't look at democracy now it was
[44:59] right
[45:00] but it's run it's lived its life
[45:04] kings lived their life and kingdoms and
[45:06] dictators and all lived there today
[45:08] democracy was the best thing they had
[45:10] but it's so polluted through politics
[45:12] it's rotten to the core
[45:14] no hopes on it at all
[45:17] i hope we can believe the prophet no
[45:20] hopes on
[45:20] it at all you're just like trying to
[45:23] build on a charred city that's burnt to
[45:25] smolders
[45:26] you can't build it it's ruined and gone
[45:29] and it has to be that way it must come
[45:31] that way the bible says it'll be that
[45:33] way
[45:34] satan is the ruler of every nation every
[45:37] kingdom belongs to satan
[45:39] and he rules him according to his own
[45:42] way
[45:42] of ruling no the people have the power
[45:47] [Laughter]
[45:52] democracies failed to run its course
[45:55] it's rotten by politics
[46:01] i don't mean to trouble you but this is
[46:03] what the prophet said
[46:06] and it's better to come to terms with it
[46:07] now
[46:09] because it's not going to get any better
[46:15] satan is the ruler of every nation every
[46:16] kingdom belongs to satan and he rules
[46:18] them according to his
[46:19] own way of ruling
[46:30] brother rem says in birth pains now she
[46:32] must rot of course
[46:34] speaking of the united states as i have
[46:36] said in order to bring new birth look
[46:38] what she has rotted into notice my
[46:40] brother and she's totally
[46:41] rotten her politics and system is just
[46:43] as rotten as they can be
[46:45] there isn't a sound bone in her in her
[46:48] world system in her politics and her
[46:49] religious politics
[46:50] and whatever it is one says i'm a
[46:52] democrat i'm a republican i'm a
[46:53] methodist i'm baptist
[46:55] why the whole thing is rotten to the
[46:57] core there's got to be something give
[46:59] way
[46:59] she can't stand if you put a george
[47:01] washington or abraham lincoln in every
[47:03] county in these
[47:04] united states it still couldn't come
[47:06] back
[47:07] it's beyond redemption
[47:11] it's beyond redemption
[47:20] brother remember says in god's provided
[47:22] place of worship this world must soon
[47:24] come to an end it can't go much longer
[47:27] sin is too deep it's beyond hope there
[47:29] is no more hope for the world it's past
[47:31] that
[47:32] i believe the holy spirit is gleaning in
[47:33] the fields finding this one and that one
[47:35] for the hour
[47:36] is far spent i'm going to say this i
[47:39] want to make a few more statements but
[47:41] also say
[47:41] brother branham said i'm glad that i
[47:43] live in america i'd rather live here
[47:44] than anywhere else
[47:45] and i agree and he said here are canada
[47:50] so that's throw off to the canadians
[47:53] said here are canada and i'm still that
[47:55] way but i wonder if we'll still be that
[47:57] way
[47:58] years from now if there is years from
[48:00] now are things continuing would we still
[48:01] feel that way
[48:02] i still feel that way today so it's not
[48:04] a bash against where we live
[48:06] i'm glad grateful where he's placed me
[48:07] there's benefits there's been privileges
[48:09] there's been a a a a a way of living
[48:12] that's been nice nice to raise a family
[48:14] nice to live in
[48:15] relative peace
[48:18] but that's not where our security comes
[48:20] from that's not what we put our hope in
[48:22] it's not our place of safety that's not
[48:24] our refuge in the time of storm
[48:25] that's not the thing that brings us
[48:26] security our position in christ brings
[48:29] us security
[48:31] the nation has to fall has run its
[48:33] course it's beyond redemption there's no
[48:35] hope for it anymore these are the things
[48:37] that brother branham has told us
[48:41] but you see
[48:44] you see the denominational world
[48:47] especially the evangelicals
[48:49] and the right-wing conservatives which
[48:51] are mostly christians
[48:54] it's their only hope
[48:57] you can see in the way they talk you can
[48:59] see them the way they act
[49:00] it is their only hope amen and i mean
[49:03] they're
[49:04] up in arms i mean ready to fight
[49:07] because it looks like an election is
[49:09] rigged and being stolen
[49:10] losing their candidate and they're i
[49:12] mean just absolutely beside themselves
[49:14] and i would say that they have no
[49:17] pavilion and no
[49:18] secret tabernacle that i have because
[49:20] i'm singing and rejoicing and happy
[49:22] and thankful and glad because
[49:24] everything's ticking just the way it's
[49:25] got to be
[49:26] these things have to fall they have to
[49:28] collapse every system of man has to fall
[49:30] to ruin
[49:31] amen because we're coming amen to that
[49:33] seventh trumpet amen all the way over in
[49:34] revelation 11
[49:36] where he says the kingdoms of this world
[49:38] have become the kingdoms of our god and
[49:40] his christ
[49:42] that's what i'm putting my hope on
[49:44] that's where my faith is
[49:45] i'm not turning this around not patching
[49:47] it up not
[49:48] not not somehow a grassroots effort to
[49:51] fix it there is no grassroots effort to
[49:53] fix this the prophet said it's beyond
[49:56] redemption
[49:58] amen in the religious world i mean
[50:00] they're trying to redeem america bring
[50:02] it back to her glory days there is no
[50:04] more glory days
[50:05] america has become the beast of
[50:07] revelation 13 and must be the beast of
[50:10] revelation 13.
[50:12] it's prophecy that's what it must be
[50:16] and i say that to say this don't
[50:20] let that discourage you one drop
[50:24] one drop if anything it should be
[50:26] encouraging because the prophet said it
[50:28] amen we're seeing it it's manifest it's
[50:30] the truth amen
[50:32] it was thus saith the lord it's right
[50:36] and one thing that discourages me i mean
[50:38] when you see people who are message
[50:40] believers getting
[50:41] caught up in that political realm to try
[50:43] to turn the thing around
[50:44] and save the nation when the prophet
[50:46] said it's beyond redemption
[50:48] and what's happening is the devil is
[50:50] trapping you and pulling you out
[50:51] of the secret of your tabernacle
[50:53] stealing your joy because of an election
[50:56] stealing your joy because of a nation
[50:58] that's under the rule of satan
[51:01] that he is ruling the way he wants to
[51:03] rule it
[51:05] and we're losing our joy over that
[51:10] we're becoming fearful and anxious and
[51:13] nervous
[51:13] and irritated amen and getting on
[51:15] facebook and fighting
[51:17] with democrats
[51:25] you understand friends
[51:29] our victory is finished
[51:32] it's already been met the battle's won
[51:35] the victory is ours the kingdom is ours
[51:39] the kingdoms of this world has become
[51:40] the kingdoms of our god in this christ
[51:42] and i'm a joint heir i'm part of that
[51:45] christ
[51:47] i'm falling air it's going to be
[51:50] renovated and burned over
[51:51] and i'm falling air to it why do i want
[51:54] to prop it up
[52:00] see a denominational faith
[52:04] in a historical jesus
[52:08] brings a denominational response to
[52:10] current events
[52:13] i hope you can catch that
[52:18] but if we can just take what the prophet
[52:20] said in believing
[52:22] all these things have to be this way
[52:25] everything's ticking right on time
[52:28] [Music]
[52:30] it's not that there's not discouraging
[52:32] thing that's happening it's discouraging
[52:34] and it's not that you can't get rocked
[52:36] in your flesh it's not that you can't be
[52:38] surprised or shocked
[52:39] it's not that you can't real amen but
[52:42] but
[52:43] there's nothing we can do about it the
[52:45] only thing we can do is run into the
[52:47] place of refuge
[52:48] and begin to sing and rejoice because my
[52:50] head is lifted above my enemies
[52:52] i'm set on the firm foundation of the
[52:54] rock of the revelation of jesus christ
[52:56] i'm in the secret of his tabernacle
[52:58] i am secure my security was not in the
[53:00] nation my security sure isn't in social
[53:02] security
[53:05] my security is not in a stimulus package
[53:07] or the us dollar holding its value
[53:09] my security is not in the u.s military
[53:11] or a strong border
[53:12] my security is not in elected officials
[53:15] my security is in christ
[53:17] my security and my refuge and my place
[53:19] of safety is in that secret tabernacle
[53:22] amen set upon this rock of christ the
[53:24] revelation of this hour
[53:25] worshiping the present day jesus christ
[53:28] the word may manifest in this hour
[53:29] this message
[53:33] and why can't we be happy in there
[53:37] why can't we sing and praise and rejoice
[53:40] though there's enemies all about though
[53:42] everything's going wrong
[53:43] those are there's a tightening up coming
[53:45] there's a pressure and a squeeze coming
[53:46] upon the bride
[53:47] why can't i still sing and the secret of
[53:50] his pavilion
[53:52] laws are changing things are changing
[53:54] rapidly i think
[53:56] what god has done for us is by his grace
[53:59] he has
[54:00] absolutely done the best thing he can
[54:01] ever do for us by peeling back the false
[54:04] front of democracy and showing us that
[54:06] we live in a tyranny
[54:10] so how can you say that by the time we
[54:12] have a constitution the constitution has
[54:14] been overridden
[54:17] how has it been overridden by a
[54:18] declaration of emergency
[54:22] and now we found out that under certain
[54:25] conditions
[54:28] when conditions change in states of
[54:31] emergency
[54:36] i wonder if the catholic church can
[54:37] create states of emergency
[54:42] in states of emergency governors have
[54:45] become dictators
[54:48] bypassing their own legislative branch
[54:50] and ruling with the pen
[54:55] i hope i'm not making you angry
[54:58] i hope that you're just realizing it's
[55:01] the truth
[55:03] so many people maybe even message
[55:05] believers were caught in the falsehood
[55:07] of
[55:07] a democracy a godly nation uh
[55:11] friends is not a godly nation brother
[55:12] bam said it wasn't a godly nation he
[55:14] said it's worse than sodom and gomorrah
[55:21] we're under the falsehood of we live in
[55:23] freedom we don't live in freedom
[55:28] tomorrow night you can't go out past 10
[55:30] o'clock you can't leave your house in
[55:31] the state of ohio
[55:32] how free are you
[55:36] you might as well come to terms with it
[55:38] you might as well face the facts
[55:42] that america's gone brother bam told us
[55:45] all those things were already in place
[55:47] we just didn't see
[55:48] him until a worldwide pandemic comes
[55:50] along when a worldwide pandemic comes
[55:52] along we see what he was telling us was
[55:54] already there
[55:57] already in laws already in place already
[56:00] passed by congress congress's
[56:01] amen already passed by legislative
[56:03] branches those things are there
[56:05] but they just wait for the right
[56:06] conditions where they can go into effect
[56:08] emergency clauses and worldwide
[56:09] pandemics and and
[56:11] and domestic war
[56:15] these things are coming friends one
[56:17] after the other after the other
[56:21] god in his grace peeled the false front
[56:24] of democracy off
[56:26] so that we can lose all hope in that
[56:30] so that we can quit being upset and
[56:32] bothered and discouraged
[56:33] by what the prophet told us already was
[56:41] and just say you know what
[56:45] the world's crazy scary things are going
[56:48] all around
[56:50] do you know what i'm going to do i'm
[56:52] going to pick up my seal book and go
[56:53] back into the secret of the tabernacle
[56:58] you know what i would encourage all of
[56:59] us to do
[57:01] is get off our phones and computers and
[57:03] quit watching the news and go back to
[57:05] the message
[57:08] and that goes for all of us it's not
[57:11] wrong to check the news
[57:12] i'm not please don't get me wrong
[57:14] brother bam talked all over
[57:15] all the time about reading the newspaper
[57:17] so i mean we're not condemning checking
[57:19] the news
[57:19] but it all of a sudden it becomes so
[57:21] shocking and things change so fast
[57:23] also you become addictive and the
[57:24] updates and the and you're constantly
[57:26] and what you're doing is you're
[57:27] constantly delving in a world of
[57:28] unbelief
[57:30] in a world that is falling apart a world
[57:32] that is discouraging
[57:33] a world that is changing so rapidly amen
[57:36] and then then you you if you listen to
[57:39] commentators i'm telling you you're
[57:40] going to pick up their spirit
[57:43] i'll tell you for sure you start
[57:45] listening to commentators on the radio
[57:47] and talk show host
[57:48] you will pick up their spirit amen and
[57:51] and i can spend some time with you
[57:52] and i could tell you who you've been
[57:54] listening to on the radio
[57:56] because if you listen to this guy he's
[57:57] super sarcastic you'll be super
[57:59] sarcastic
[58:00] this other carl guy he calls the
[58:02] opposing party names and you'll start
[58:04] using the same names he uses for that
[58:05] opposing party
[58:09] do you understand what i'm saying
[58:13] what's the point they're all fussing and
[58:16] fighting
[58:16] amongst themselves what are they trying
[58:19] to do
[58:20] everybody wants to be the captain of a
[58:21] sinking ship
[58:25] it's taking torpedoes it's full of holes
[58:27] the mast is broken in half
[58:28] i mean the sails have burnt up in fire
[58:30] there's no food there's no water
[58:32] and who wants to be the captain they're
[58:34] standing in line to try to pilot this
[58:35] boat
[58:37] let them fight over it let them have it
[58:45] i'm part of a kingdom kingdom of god is
[58:48] in me
[58:50] that kingdom is sure that kingdom is
[58:51] secure
[58:53] i'm i'm on a rock in a pavilion
[58:56] in the secret of a tabernacle and i will
[58:58] sing praises to the lord i will rejoice
[59:00] yea
[59:00] i will sing praises unto god for
[59:02] everything in my life
[59:04] is perfect
[59:07] i am secure i am safe
[59:10] everything is fine with me
[59:16] let's turn to mark four
[59:19] mark chapter four
[59:34] mark chapter 4 verse 35
[59:45] and the same day when even was come he
[59:47] saith unto them let us pass over and to
[59:49] the other side
[59:50] and when they had sent away the
[59:52] multitude they took him even as
[59:54] he was in the ship and they were also
[59:56] with them other little ships
[59:57] and there arose a great storm of wind
[59:59] and the waves beat unto the ship
[1:00:01] so that it was now full and he was in
[1:00:03] the hinder part of the ship
[1:00:05] asleep on a pillow and they wake him and
[1:00:09] say unto him master carest down not that
[1:00:11] we perish
[1:00:12] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[1:00:14] said unto the sea
[1:00:15] peace be still and the wind ceased and
[1:00:18] there was a great calm
[1:00:19] and he said unto them why are you so
[1:00:21] fearful and how is it that you have
[1:00:24] no faith i want to read quite
[1:00:27] quite a lengthy quote out of calling
[1:00:30] jesus on the scene from august in 1963.
[1:00:34] brother ben was he's telling he's taking
[1:00:35] the same scripture and he's dramatizing
[1:00:37] he's telling us the story around it
[1:00:39] and so it is you know it might have been
[1:00:41] the young john that hadn't had his heart
[1:00:43] so scarred with so much theology
[1:00:45] he must have said something like this
[1:00:47] think of it right here in the ship
[1:00:49] this one that is identified by jehovah's
[1:00:52] word to be jehovah's servant
[1:00:53] in whom he is pleased is right here in
[1:00:56] the ship with us
[1:00:57] what a secured feeling
[1:01:00] oh please just hang with me and catch
[1:01:02] this story the way brother ben was
[1:01:03] telling him
[1:01:04] what a secure feeling oh if we tonight
[1:01:07] could only catch that vision
[1:01:08] the very jehovah that made the heavens
[1:01:10] and the earth is right in this little
[1:01:12] vessel of ours
[1:01:14] while we're sailing life solemn maine
[1:01:16] for the holy ghost is jehovah in spirit
[1:01:18] form
[1:01:19] in you god the holy spirit has got
[1:01:22] himself in you
[1:01:23] jesus said at that day you'll know that
[1:01:24] i am in the father the father and me i
[1:01:26] in you and you and me oh oh my then god
[1:01:29] all that god was he poured into jesus
[1:01:31] all that jesus was he poured into his
[1:01:33] church dividing himself on the day of
[1:01:35] pentecost
[1:01:36] that pillar of fire come down and busted
[1:01:38] himself up the shekinah glory
[1:01:39] and put it in different ones tongues of
[1:01:41] fire was seen upon each one the holy
[1:01:44] spirit
[1:01:44] god identifying himself in human beings
[1:01:48] talk about amazing grace how sweet to
[1:01:49] sound what a
[1:01:51] what a secure it is how secure we feel
[1:01:54] to know that
[1:01:55] when we're driving on the highways
[1:01:56] whatever we're doing that jesus lays in
[1:01:58] the ship
[1:01:59] amen the one who who can perform any
[1:02:02] miracle can do anything that he wants to
[1:02:04] do
[1:02:04] doing it again perfectly identifying
[1:02:06] himself he is in our little boat as
[1:02:08] we're sailing life solemn maine
[1:02:10] same as he was then so is he now what a
[1:02:13] feeling of security
[1:02:14] while sailing the troubled waters of
[1:02:16] life
[1:02:18] that's our security friends further down
[1:02:21] he says they
[1:02:22] they were something like us today those
[1:02:24] disciples out there on that ship that
[1:02:26] night
[1:02:26] after the revival was feasting on the
[1:02:29] results
[1:02:30] brother mum says they were having
[1:02:31] testimony service talking about all that
[1:02:33] they had seen him do
[1:02:36] i want you to catch this they were
[1:02:37] talking about all that they had seen him
[1:02:39] do previously
[1:02:41] and he was in the ship but he was asleep
[1:02:49] it says now maybe between the revivals
[1:02:52] now
[1:02:53] he said they were feasting that night
[1:02:55] after the revival was feasting on the
[1:02:57] results
[1:02:58] now maybe between the revivals now we
[1:03:00] are looking for another stir
[1:03:03] where there has got to be something
[1:03:04] happen now that will gather the church
[1:03:06] together
[1:03:07] there will have to be some kind of a
[1:03:08] press
[1:03:11] god always does it that way to run his
[1:03:13] people together
[1:03:15] is oppressed a bad thing or a good thing
[1:03:18] depends on if you're flesh or if you're
[1:03:20] in the spirit
[1:03:24] he said i believe that it's already
[1:03:26] being formed
[1:03:27] that will shut out everything that won't
[1:03:29] agree with them and then it's going to
[1:03:31] run the church together
[1:03:32] and we're waiting for that to happen and
[1:03:34] we're living on the results of the great
[1:03:35] revival that we just
[1:03:37] passed and he is resting
[1:03:41] a couple paragraphs down he says then
[1:03:43] trouble arose
[1:03:44] all of a sudden
[1:03:47] the ship began to rock the sails blew
[1:03:50] off the oars broke the water filled up
[1:03:51] the boat
[1:03:52] trouble at hand see it happened suddenly
[1:03:55] all hopes of survival was gone though
[1:03:57] they had seen him do so many great
[1:03:59] things when trouble strikes they forgot
[1:04:01] all about it now i want to ask you
[1:04:04] something as a brother isn't that about
[1:04:06] the attitude of the people today
[1:04:08] well come to church here and shout and
[1:04:09] praise god when our brothers and so
[1:04:11] forth speak
[1:04:12] the word we can hear the promises we
[1:04:14] just praise god for what he's done
[1:04:16] listen at the testimony of that one
[1:04:17] saying i was once blind
[1:04:19] my eyes were blind now i see one said
[1:04:21] the doctors give me up with cancer and
[1:04:23] in two weeks or two days or some
[1:04:24] there wasn't one speck of cancer that's
[1:04:27] been a long time ago
[1:04:28] they can't find it no more yet i laid
[1:04:30] bound up in a wheelchair paralyzed i
[1:04:32] walked as good as anybody else we hear
[1:04:34] those testimonies
[1:04:35] but just like it let it strike our
[1:04:37] little house one time
[1:04:38] then we forget all about the glory that
[1:04:40] we've been enjoying
[1:04:42] all those great things oh it's us now
[1:04:45] see
[1:04:45] those things happen for a purpose they
[1:04:47] happen to try you
[1:04:49] now trouble that we can't remedy seems
[1:04:51] like the doctors can't remedy
[1:04:53] and there is nothing can remedy they
[1:04:56] tried to pull their sails it blew away
[1:04:58] they tried their oars they broke they
[1:05:00] run to the middle of the ship it filled
[1:05:02] up
[1:05:02] satan was determined to take them now he
[1:05:04] thought he had jesus asleep
[1:05:06] away from them and then he could slip in
[1:05:08] on them
[1:05:09] now that's the way it is today when
[1:05:11] satan gets a chance here he comes
[1:05:13] and you go to the doctor he says there's
[1:05:15] nothing you can do it's advanced
[1:05:17] who he hasn't gotten nothing for a
[1:05:19] nervous breakdown we haven't gotten
[1:05:21] anything for mental troubles
[1:05:22] no we can't do nothing arthritis no we
[1:05:25] can't do nothing for that
[1:05:26] we can maybe give you cortisone and
[1:05:28] that'll kill you so we haven't got
[1:05:30] nothing for it leukemia
[1:05:31] nothing we can do about it see then you
[1:05:33] get all trouble
[1:05:35] but look back hasn't he healed leukemia
[1:05:38] hasn't he healed cancer
[1:05:39] hasn't he done everything right hasn't
[1:05:41] he kept his word see get
[1:05:43] trouble when it strikes our little ship
[1:05:45] this little bark that we're sailing in
[1:05:47] is frail anyhow gets filled up with
[1:05:49] doubts
[1:05:50] world notice trouble that they could not
[1:05:54] remedy
[1:05:55] then fear sets in
[1:05:59] listen troubles they could not remedy
[1:06:04] as long as those fishermen could
[1:06:06] navigate the boat
[1:06:08] they weren't fearful as long as the sail
[1:06:11] was intact and the oars were in their
[1:06:13] hand
[1:06:13] and they could set a course and steer
[1:06:15] there was no problem but when they come
[1:06:16] to the situation that they could no
[1:06:18] longer remedy
[1:06:19] then fear set in i'm telling you friends
[1:06:23] we're in troublesome times in this
[1:06:25] country and
[1:06:25] all around that we cannot remedy
[1:06:29] there's not a thing we can do to protect
[1:06:31] ourselves defend ourselves
[1:06:34] there's nothing
[1:06:37] notice trouble they could not remedy and
[1:06:40] fear sits in just like it is now
[1:06:43] even we got fears and national troubles
[1:06:46] amen we got fears and church troubles
[1:06:50] we got fears all around everywhere now
[1:06:52] we say well now
[1:06:53] what can we do about it if we could only
[1:06:55] remember that he
[1:06:56] is in the ship see but but yes
[1:07:00] he is in the ship this is him in the
[1:07:03] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:07:04] god and the word was god and the word is
[1:07:06] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:09] did you catch what he said he said if we
[1:07:11] can just remember he's in the ship
[1:07:13] where's he at the word that was in the
[1:07:15] beginning is the same yesterday today
[1:07:17] and forever
[1:07:18] how's he in the ship he is the word and
[1:07:21] the word is here
[1:07:23] the revelation of the word is here he is
[1:07:25] in the ship
[1:07:28] but i don't see him if you see the
[1:07:30] revealed word for the day you see him
[1:07:33] if you see the manifested word in this
[1:07:34] hour you see him and he's in the ship
[1:07:37] in what form is he in the ship he's in
[1:07:39] the form of the word
[1:07:41] made manifest in this day
[1:07:46] i'll read that again is he in the ship
[1:07:49] that's the question but is yes is he in
[1:07:52] the ship
[1:07:53] here this is him brother brahm's going
[1:07:56] to identify him this is him
[1:07:58] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:07:59] word was with god and the word was god
[1:08:03] what's that it's him
[1:08:07] and the word is the same yesterday today
[1:08:08] and forever how is the word
[1:08:10] the same yesterday and today forever
[1:08:12] because the word has always been in
[1:08:13] every age the manifested word for that
[1:08:15] day and the manifested word and the
[1:08:18] present tense
[1:08:18] day is always the same yesterday today
[1:08:21] and forever
[1:08:25] it's still just take this it's the
[1:08:27] remedy it's the medicine
[1:08:29] it's the cure for every breakdown it's
[1:08:31] the cure for every cancer it's the cure
[1:08:32] for every ailment
[1:08:33] it's god manifested in a word the word
[1:08:36] is god
[1:08:37] jesus said it's a seed the seed being
[1:08:38] planted in the right kind of ground
[1:08:40] it'll grow exactly what it is and every
[1:08:42] promise will be produced
[1:08:44] we forget all about it now that now that
[1:08:47] he is in the ship
[1:08:49] they should have known that he knew that
[1:08:51] that thing was going to happen
[1:08:55] it just brother i'm saying they're
[1:08:57] troubled oars are broke amen
[1:08:59] the sail is torn it's taking on water
[1:09:02] they can no longer steer it amen they
[1:09:03] get troubled
[1:09:04] and they forgot that he's in the ship
[1:09:06] they had spiritual amnesia
[1:09:08] and they forgot that he was present with
[1:09:10] them in the form of the manifested word
[1:09:18] and they should have known that he back
[1:09:21] there sleeping was already
[1:09:22] aware that this was going to happen
[1:09:25] they should have known that he knew that
[1:09:27] the thing was going to happen do you
[1:09:28] believe that
[1:09:29] certainly he knew it he knew all the
[1:09:31] time it was going to happen why
[1:09:33] he only did it to to prove to test their
[1:09:37] faith
[1:09:38] why was he sleeping to prove their faith
[1:09:41] he could have stayed active he could
[1:09:43] have been walking around the boat he
[1:09:44] could have been encouraging the whole
[1:09:45] time
[1:09:45] don't worry i know all about this don't
[1:09:47] worry i know it's going to happen
[1:09:48] amen don't worry everything's going to
[1:09:50] be fine but the whole scene was set to
[1:09:53] prove and test her faith
[1:09:55] so he was back in the boat sleeping amen
[1:09:58] so that they would so that they would
[1:10:00] forget
[1:10:02] he was there sometimes things strike us
[1:10:06] and it seems like god is asleep
[1:10:10] things happen and it seems it seems like
[1:10:13] he can't be reached
[1:10:17] but you should know you should know he
[1:10:20] already knew this was going to happen
[1:10:23] coven 19 did not take jesus christ by
[1:10:26] surprise
[1:10:29] neither does the thing that's coming
[1:10:31] next has taken him by surprise or the
[1:10:33] thing after that or
[1:10:34] it's not taking him by surprise they
[1:10:36] should have known he's in the ship and
[1:10:37] he already knows it's going to happen
[1:10:41] he's in our little ship our little bark
[1:10:43] it's frail it's weak
[1:10:44] amen there's things that we can't remedy
[1:10:46] but don't forget he's in the boat
[1:10:49] and don't forget he already knew this
[1:10:50] was going to happen he's only allowed
[1:10:52] this to happen to prove the faith of his
[1:10:55] bride
[1:10:55] because his bride will stand on the word
[1:10:57] amen she'll stay
[1:10:58] with the manifested word and she won't
[1:11:00] budge off of it
[1:11:02] even when it seems like it's not working
[1:11:04] to remedy the situation
[1:11:05] she's being tested to stay with the word
[1:11:13] and sometimes he does the same thing for
[1:11:15] you and me
[1:11:17] he lets things happen just to see what
[1:11:19] we'll do about it
[1:11:22] are you going to get on facebook forums
[1:11:25] political analysis arguments
[1:11:30] are you going to go to the secret of the
[1:11:32] tabernacle
[1:11:36] you know the other day i got so tired of
[1:11:40] reading news
[1:11:42] i just picked up the breach
[1:11:46] and i just started slowly very slowly
[1:11:49] going through the breach one or two
[1:11:50] pages at a time
[1:11:52] and guess what i did i sang
[1:11:55] i rejoiced i sang praises to the lord
[1:11:58] because i realized i'm in the secret of
[1:12:00] a tabernacle
[1:12:02] i realized he's present how is he
[1:12:04] present the manifested word
[1:12:05] amen what was breaking my spiritual
[1:12:07] amnesia that was causing discouragement
[1:12:09] it was the breach friends it was the
[1:12:11] message of the hour
[1:12:12] that was reminding me he's in the boat
[1:12:15] and he already knows about it
[1:12:16] don't lose sleep don't get stressed
[1:12:19] don't let your blood pressure go up
[1:12:21] everything's fine
[1:12:28] i'll read this again sometimes he does
[1:12:30] the same thing for you and me
[1:12:33] he lets things just happen to see what
[1:12:35] we'll do about it do you believe that
[1:12:36] the scripture said every son that cometh
[1:12:38] to god must be tried
[1:12:39] chastened prude satan will make you
[1:12:41] prove every inch of ground that you
[1:12:43] claim he certainly will
[1:12:45] so sometimes god lets those things
[1:12:48] happen
[1:12:51] jesus says in luke 17 or luke 12 32
[1:12:55] fear not little flock it's the father's
[1:12:58] good pleasure to give you the kingdom
[1:13:01] don't be worried don't be fearful
[1:13:06] i'd like to read another scripture
[1:13:09] together psalms 23
[1:13:11] and we'll end with this one
[1:13:24] how many of you believe are in the
[1:13:26] rapture how many heard the shout
[1:13:29] come up higher many's been called out of
[1:13:32] laodicea called out of denominationalism
[1:13:34] resurrected a new life if that's the
[1:13:38] case then you've been placed in the
[1:13:39] secret of the tabernacle
[1:13:41] in the pavilion on the rock with your
[1:13:44] head above your enemies
[1:13:46] your position overrides
[1:13:49] your condition
[1:13:52] but i'm sick in my body but i'm in the
[1:13:55] secret of the tabernacle
[1:13:57] i'm up upon a rock i've heard the shout
[1:13:59] i've come up higher
[1:14:01] i'm in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:14:03] my position in christ is secure
[1:14:05] it doesn't matter now what happens this
[1:14:07] is something god knew was going to
[1:14:08] happen
[1:14:08] he's allowed it for his glory he's
[1:14:10] accomplishing something some purpose and
[1:14:12] whatever whatever's happening in my
[1:14:14] life whatever troubles come upon me god
[1:14:16] is going to get glory in this and god's
[1:14:18] going to accomplish his purpose
[1:14:19] and my life and the lives of others so
[1:14:22] i'm not
[1:14:23] i'm not going to let it bring me down
[1:14:24] and i'm not going to let it pull me
[1:14:26] out of the secret chamber i'm going to
[1:14:28] stay right here and sing praises to the
[1:14:30] lord
[1:14:33] he says in psalms 32 verse 1
[1:14:37] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:14:41] he's making me to lie down in green
[1:14:43] pastures he leadeth me besides the
[1:14:45] waters
[1:14:46] he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[1:14:48] the paths of righteousness
[1:14:49] for his name's sake yea though i walk
[1:14:52] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:14:54] death
[1:14:54] i will feel no fear no evil for thou art
[1:14:58] with me
[1:14:59] because you're in the boat he's in the

[1:15:06] how dark it gets in the shabash and the

[1:15:26] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
