[0:00] when Jesus resurrects from the dead is
[0:02] seen of his disciples he gathers them
[0:04] together he speaks to them right before
[0:05] he leaves in Acts chapter 1 he says tear
[0:07] you in
[0:08] Jerusalem and wait for the promise of
[0:11] the father that I spoke to you about
[0:14] what is the promise of the father he
[0:16] spoke to him about this was the promise
[0:18] that the comforter is coming
[0:21] right he he said it many ways in many
[0:23] ways he said my father will come to you
[0:26] and I will come to you and we'll make
[0:27] our Abode in you
[0:30] all right now brother Brandon is
[0:32] preaching Christ is the mystery of God
[0:34] reveal after the opening of The Seven
[0:35] Seals and he's talking about the day in
[0:37] which we live in today and he's going to
[0:39] grab the same scripture amen and he's
[0:43] going to bring the same scripture to a
[0:44] fulfillment
[0:46] today he said Jesus said at that day
[0:49] that's this
[0:51] day at that day when when this
[0:54] Revelation is made
[0:56] known you will know that I am in the
[0:58] father and the father in me I in you and
[1:01] you in meall when the Revelation is made
[1:05] manifest at that day you shall know that
[1:08] I and the father are one I am in the
[1:10] father and the father is in me then when
[1:13] the revelations comes forth then it's I
[1:15] in you and you and me there you are see
[1:18] the manifold three-fold manifestation
[1:20] what for what for to bring it back
[1:24] praise God back to what back to what it
[1:27] was at
[1:28] Pentecost amen
[1:31] amen praise God
[1:34] Amen now oh God help me I get so fooled
[1:39] that I don't know how to bring it out it
[1:41] just gets so full so you're going to
[1:42] have to bring it out work a little
[1:43] harder
[1:45] now praise
[1:47] God at that day at the Feast of
[1:50] Pentecost that's right when they were
[1:53] hiding in the upper room when they were
[1:55] afraid of the Jews when they weren't
[1:57] certain what to do when they had this
[1:59] confusion now they're waiting and they
[2:00] don't know exactly what they're waiting
[2:02] for they know exactly what it's going to
[2:03] look like don't what it's going to
[2:04] happen and then they're nervous about
[2:06] the authorities and they've got all this
[2:07] going on listen at that day they knew
[2:11] that he was in the father and the father
[2:12] was in
[2:13] him they knew that they knew he was the
[2:17] Messiah they knew he was the son of the
[2:19] Living God they knew he alone had the
[2:21] words of eternal life they knew he had
[2:23] died and that he had resurrected and
[2:25] that he ascended on
[2:27] high they knew all of that
[2:30] they had faith in all of that they
[2:32] witnessed to that and they believed it
[2:38] all but it seems like they needed
[2:40] something a little higher in the
[2:43] Revelation because that Revelation had
[2:45] them hiding that Revelation had them
[2:47] uncertain that Revelation I mean still
[2:50] had Peter going back to fishing and all
[2:52] kinds of stuff but they needed the next
[2:54] step in the Revelation and that next
[2:56] step in the Revelation would come in
[2:58] that day you'll know that I'm in the
[3:00] father you and me and I in you now
[3:03] you're part of the mystery you're part
[3:05] of the plan what changed it Pentecost at
[3:08] Pentecost God by filling them with his
[3:11] Spirit made them the Fulfillment of the
[3:14] word and part of the prophecy then they
[3:17] rush out with boldness then they know
[3:19] the word then they speak the word then
[3:21] they preach with boldness then they look
[3:23] into the then they look unto the lame
[3:25] man that says look unto us
[3:30] look unto us why they're now part of it
[3:34] it's inside of them they're in Christ
[3:36] and Christ is in them and it changes
[3:38] everything for
[3:40] them and at this day amen at that day
[3:44] that's this day
