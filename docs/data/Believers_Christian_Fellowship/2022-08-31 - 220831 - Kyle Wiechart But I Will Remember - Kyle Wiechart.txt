right away it's nice to be here this evening always an honor and a privilege to come and see what he will say i really never quite know you would think the more you do this the better and easier it's supposed to get but it doesn't work that way i realize you're just more dependent more needy each and every day for his leadership and his guidance before we read this i thought i was going to go a completely different subject brother chad asked me on saturday and as i began to study out that direction i just hit a brick wall i couldn't go anywhere i had no inspiration whatsoever and and then i just didn't know what to do on monday and then on tuesday i still didn't know what to do and then i just did some bible reading and some devotion time and in my morning devotions just something jumped off the page to me and it's kind of an odd chapter in the bible it's an uh it's a bit of an odd scripture setting made me question i had to sit there and really ponder it meditate on it and um and then that evening i still thought i was going to go a different direction and every time i'd go back and think of what i read that morning it just kind of lit me up again so if it's all right i want to talk about it i want to look at it i think there's a reason for it i actually believe with all my heart there's a reason for it it's just sometimes things light up at the right time and you just want to follow that leading and this is you know the last time i ministered i had 10 pages of notes i knew what i was going to preach two weeks before i felt really good about it i was like my lord will you do this every time this is wonderful and then i come tonight and all i have is a direction like it's just like go north and i don't know any other way i'm just i'm just heading this way and so he'll have to turn me as we as we travel this road but there's one thing i have confidence in god keeps his word we've assembled ourselves together this is what he said to do and he said he would he promised to meet us there and that's all i know and that's what i have a confidence in is this journey goes on in life i just have a promise he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me he'll be with me wherever i go so i don't always have to understand or figure everything out i just have to follow his lead wherever he leads me i just want to follow so i hope it's okay i'm going to really need you to pull because again i'm just going north right now and if he says go south we're going to go south and we'll see what happens i'd like you to turn in your bibles to psalms 77. and i have a little bit of a lengthy reading but i kind of have to read the whole in order for the context and the thought so i want to look at the entire chapter of psalms 77. just say amen when you're there amen let's begin i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me in the day of my trouble i saw the lord my sore ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted i remembered god and i was troubled i complained and my spirit was overwhelmed saylah thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so troubled that i cannot speak i have considered the days of old and the years of ancient times i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with mine own heart and my spirit made diligent search will the lord cast off forever and will he be favorable no more is his mercy clean gone forever doth his promise fail forevermore hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies selah and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember thy wonders of old i will meditate also on all thy work and talk of all thy doings thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god as our god thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy strength among thy people thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph selah the waters saw thee oh god the waters saw thee and they were afraid and the depths were also troubled the clouds poured out water and the sky sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven and the lightnings lightened the world and the earth trembled and it shook thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known thou lettest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron may we just bow our heads for prayer most gracious heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity lord to think of all the people this day in this world are doing so many other things and you by your grace have brought us into your presence to hear your most precious words and we're not like other churches that would gather wondering lord well god will you speak to us and i no we know you'll speak to us tonight father we're we're in the presence of the most high this is not a church like other churches this is a church where we come to hear the voice of god and we hear it we're we come into a place where when we ask you a question you actually speak back to us father this is one thing that we know that lord you're a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart you know our goings and our comings you know if i like david said if i make my bed and hell thou art there lord you know where we are you know what's going on so father god i just pray that you would take me in my insufficiency your unworthy servant lord and just use me to speak your words to your most precious precious bride father lord encourage our hearts strengthen us lord and focus our vision father we pray we love you and thank you in jesus name amen you may be seated for a moment so this is the scripture that i was drawn to that just seemed to jump off the page from me and i want to bring some special emphasis to this and different portions of this and break it down for a moment but my title for tonight is but i will remember amen but i will remember and here we see david is in quite a turmoil condition he's uh he's wondering certain questions that don't sound like david usually talks here's david asking questions like god have you forgotten me god have you forsaken me god have you removed your tender mercies from me and if you remember the tender mercies of david is that god deals with his children in a way of always correcting them to keep them on the right path it's never a penile judgment i'm done with you get out of the way when god corrects his children it's it's remedial it's to put you back in line and david's asking these questions almost with like oh lord have you have you forgotten your tender mercies to me will you no longer speak to me will you no longer deal with me has thy anger risen up in such a way that thou has forgotten about me but oh i remember david got struck by inspiration he says oh but i remember god and i remember what you did for the hebrew children and it's such an interesting thing here david in his mind goes back to the the stories of old and he goes back to moses and here's god with a mighty outstretched hand delivering the children of israel from the egyptians he's taking them he's bringing down flies he's bringing in frogs he's bringing in darkness he's he's sending the death angel land god is mightily on the move to set his children free and in the process of them coming free he brings them right up to a red sea this is a shocking thing in all of david wandering he gets encouraged and he remembers oh god you haven't forsaken me oh god you never forsake your people many times you just lead us to the red sea and we can't see your footsteps anymore where did you go i don't know where you went lord but you promised you'd be with me and this encouraged david and his inspiration struck him he said you didn't leave me lord you just brought me to a red sea and i just don't know where you're at but he knew the footsteps were going right through that red sea he didn't couldn't see him anymore but david had a confidence and he remembered the lord and when he remembered the lord he was encouraged and the recognition that god never forsakes his people he just takes you to a point in time he likes to test you a little bit see what kind of stand you're going to take take you to a point you don't know where you're going you don't know if he's forgotten about you you don't know if he's just totally done with you and then just to see what you will do god likes to do these things he likes to bring us into situations where it looks like god do you want to destroy me i mean you have to think what were the hebrew children saying thank you lord you brought me from here right here wonderful look at all that and then uh oh red sea lord did you did you forsake me lord have you forgotten about me no if they could have only recognized that red sea was going to be their deliverance and the destruction of their enemy see what the devil intends for evil god always uses it for good and what they did not recognize that the difficulties and they couldn't understand and the trials that was right before them was only the thing that was setting up to bring the deliverance that they had to have and was going to be in the destruction permanently they would never see their enemy again and this has consistently and always been the pathway of the believer you're he's there with you one day and you know he's walking with you and you can see him you can feel him you know he's walking it's like lord it's like oh wow you're with me everywhere i go in every decision and then before long you're just wonderful it's fantastic and then lord where did you go did you lead me into a trap did you lead me into something you want me to be destroyed no see this was the question david had david was really curious but the spirit of the lord came upon him inspiration struck me said no i remember i've seen this before i know how you deal with your children i know exactly now what you are doing you've not led me to destruction you're bringing my deliverance and so many times we forget about that and uh so brother branham says in 1959 he said isn't it a strange thing how god does he will let you get right down to the last the last mile you know he likes to do that he did that with the hebrew children he knew he he could trust so he let them them boys walk right up to a fiery furnace till they could almost smell that fire and he never moved and when it came it comes time he will move but he waits till his own time he wanted to see what kind of reaction they'd have he knowed they'd make their stand and when he knows that you will make your stand he will let satan take you to the very last mile but just remember he's still there he wants to see if you really mean what you are talking about oh i believe god's a healer yes sure i am and the next day you got all those pains well maybe i don't got it sure you got it he's just wanting to see how you're going to react on what he said you say oh praise god i believe in the baptism of the holy spirit and the first little temptation comes up and you fly off like a buzzsaw he's trying to see your reaction to the action he's trying to test you and every son that cometh the god must first be chastened and tested every child that comes he puts them through the test to see how they will act quite a test quite an opportunity that god has given us in this day and i thought it would be all right i hope this is all right i'd just like to go through this and show you this example over and over and over because david was encouraged he was down in the dumps but he got encouraged when he remembered the right thing he remembered how god has moved before and if he did it before he'll do it for me and so those footsteps that looked like they were leading into destruction were actually leading to their deliverance and oh how god likes his wonders we can't figure him out we truly can't the more you try to figure him out oh you just have faith in god that's just simple you have faith in god you know he loves you you know he's watched over you and i'll tell you i went for a walk the other morning after i read this and i just went for a walk and i was just having my own devotional time and i began to myself remember i began to remember all the times he delivered me and it's so easy for us to forget that it's so easy to forget the mighty hand of god that delivered you time and time and time again and the first little issue and problem that arises in your life it's like you forgot everything it's like oh god where you must not love me you must have forsaken me what are you talking about my goodness and i remembered i was i was walking there and uh and this and i remembered and it's the first time i could remember this i remember when i was 16 years old and it really struck me and i was going back in my mind just remembering these times when i knew he drew close to me and would talk to me and tell me something and i remember i climbed up on the top of our roof i was 16. it was before my dad got home was about 11 30. he worked second shift he wasn't home my mom was in bed and i used there was an antenna on our house and i used to climb up on that to antenna and i used to sit on that roof and just look at the sky and on them summer nights you look at the sky you see all those stars and it's kind of a real funny feeling that used to come over me and you began to look at all that and you know there's a god somewhere there's some god somewhere and i didn't know where he was but i remember sitting on that roof saying lord i don't know where you are but i am going to find you i remember saying that as a kid what in the world where did that come from i'm a 16 year old kid going to a worldly school i'm not born again i have influences all around me i have 16 year old thoughts what on the world is in this young boy sitting on a roof saying god i don't know where you are but i'm going to find you here's what i also said and i remembered saying it and i don't know why he brought it back to my remembrance but as i was walking through i remember saying this lord if i knew you were on some mountain somewhere in this world i would forsake all and fight and then as i was walking i realized oh my he was on a mountain it was mount sunset i didn't realize and i've been climbing this mountain and i'm seeing him more clear every day by his grace i didn't know what i was saying i had no idea why i would say that why would a 16 year old boy say that i don't know what mountain you're on but i'm gonna find you lord i'm gonna find you i'm so glad see he brought back to something to my remembrance sometimes you just got to do that you got to stop and think what did he bring me through why did he do those things i have to you know sometimes you know david said i have to stir myself up in the lord sometimes you got to do that you're kind of con constantly maybe sometimes you sit back waiting god you need to do something to stir me up why david didn't act like that david said you know what i'm going to remember the mighty hand of god that delivered me over and over and over again and i'm going to stir myself up in the lord i'm going to remember his goodness and his grace to me i'm going to remember how he brought me through this and he brought me through that and he brought me through this and as i kept going thinking about there then i went in that that night and i began to talk to my daughters and i remembered that joshua said hey build up all these stones so you can tell your children how god brought a great victory here and you know we're called to do that we are supposed to remind our children and talk to our wives and talk to our families and talk to one another of the goodness of god and the great victories that he brought us through we should build up some stones from time to time and say hey this here right here is where god brought my deliverance and i was going back in my mind and i started to assemble some of those stones from my daughters and they were supposed to go to bed at nine and i think i got in bed at 10. sorry sweetheart but i couldn't stop because i kept thinking of his goodness to me and i kept remembering all the times he interviewed on my behalf and i began to think also you know what i was in a home and sadly by it just i came out of a broken home now typically that would be a destructive thing for a young man you know not raised in the message not raised in the truth and now the home is broke up and there's there's no covering there's no protection i don't have a mother and father that's there to to kind of shackle me you know put things together and hold me and just what the devil would like to destroy me with was the very thing that caused me to dive into the message the very thing the very thing that convinced me that these other ministers do not preach the word of god because they want to they don't want to hurt people's feelings they're so concerned with the feelings of individuals they don't stand on the word but here's this man who unadulterately preaches the word of god just the way it is and yet i still know he loves me and it cuts me to shreds and i still know that's the real love of god that's the corrective hand of god no matter how hard it is that's still the loving hand of god that's the tender hand of jehovah no matter how straight and cutting it is it's still the love of god and actually the men that think they're doing people a favor by telling and capitulating to their feelings is the hatred they hate the people the bible says if a mother father doesn't correct their children you hate your children so the new ministers that don't want to tell people the truth they hate you they don't love you now you speak the truth and love but honestly tell the truth if you love someone you'll do that you would do that with your children you'll do that with one another but all of these things you would think that it would destroy me it was setting something up it was bringing my deliverance it was such an interesting thing so i just spent like an hour talking to my kids remembering i was remembering i was going back wow man how he delivered me here from the paul of the bear and oh he delivered me here from the lion oh he delivered me from this oh he delivered me from all these other habits i had in my life and these things that were there to destroy me man just one thing after another but the problem of it is too many times you stop thinking about that why you know what i've realized i don't care what the problem is it's really not a big deal amen it's really not a big deal the only time a problem gets big in your eyes is when god comes out of your view if my eyes are singularly focused upon the fact that god's with me his promises with me he said he would be with me he'd lead me he'd guide me how big does god get when you talk about it you ever think of that you look at how david's acting as he gets to talk oh i remember i remember the hand of god that delivered him oh i remember this he's getting excited he's not worrying about his complexes and his problems and his difficulties in his troubles he's talking about his delivery and it stirred him up again and he realized all these troubles no it just paid paved the way from my deliverance so i began to think of those things and i began to look at all these hebrew children down through the or these individuals we look at through the through the ages daniel shadrach meshach and abednego how they came captive they were prisoners in a land that wasn't their own and here they are they they are told they have to eat meat from the king's table and they remember no we are servants of jehovah no we're not going to defile ourselves with these things these are the things of the word we're not defiling ourselves see they remembered god and when they remembered god and stood for his word god remembered them and when god remembered them he made them fat and happy and looking good and they were what i think it was five seven times better looking than the other ones god took care of them because when they remembered god god remembered them and then you bring it up to shadrach meshach and abednego and here they are and here's an enemy that had risen up and they hated chad raknesha neck and bendigo there was a jealousy and hatred and they were looking to conspire and get these boys destroyed and they were put out a decree that you must bow to this image and here comes the image of belchesar which is an image of daniel and here it comes through the land and and these boys say nope long live the king but we're not bound down to that image we're not bound down to the image of a holy man and this is this thing that you're putting up we're not bowing the need to that it's compromise to the word of god and we're not doing it and so you can kill me you can do whatever you want but i'm still not bowing the need of this false false made religion and as it came up before them okay no problem we're going to take you to the fiery furnace here they go but see they had remembered their promise to god they remembered who they were they remembered what they were on this earth for they even remembered how to act in the in the confines of being a prisoner of babylon here they were this wasn't their home all the pressures around them and they knew they would die if they took this stand that it could and if god didn't deliver them they knew they would die but they said that's okay that's okay we'll die if we must if god god can deliver us but he doesn't have to if he doesn't want to so they didn't have a clue what was going to happen they just knew they were taking their stand for the lord they knew they were standing on the word but this situation was going to lead them right into a fire but oh when they remembered god god remembered them it didn't take long before the presence of the fourth man was revealed and that fire just set them free and it consumed their enemies thereafter a fire heated up seven times it just destroyed all their enemies and set them free oh god works in mysterious ways this wonders to perform don't get nervous don't get upset don't get frustrated just remember amen just stop and remember then you bring it up to daniel same situation here comes daniel and daniel prays every day twice a day i believe it was and his enemies go into action how can we get a get daniel oh they they put together a great plan man this was a good one oh they knew how to catch him this time and daniel never missed a beat it wasn't going to cause anything to him to change he wasn't going to all of a sudden forget he was a servant of the most high god though it could cost him his life he just kept serving the lord he just kept praying he never missed a beat and there he goes here we go into a a den of lions but it didn't matter because he was asked the question is all well with the daniel he said yes the lord has sent his angels to shut the mouths of the lions okay daniel let's see if your enemies if you'll shut the lot mouth of the lions for your enemies nope the very pit of lions set him free glorified god and destroyed his enemies god does this over and over and over so many times we're trying to figure things out don't don't try to figure everything out we are sheep lead i don't know how i'm going to get through the red sea but if you said i'm going i'm going i'm going to get there i don't have to worry about it i begin to think about esther here comes esther on the scene and the very one that's there to try to destroy him little does haman even realize he's setting up for his own demise because esther remembered the instruction of haggai and she was accepted by the king so then in a in a critical moment and at a critical time she had to go into the presence of the king the king remembered her and he loved her and she had a ear with the king and the very gallows and the very uh things that were made to destroy the jews and mordecai heyman hung on his own gallows man see and it set all the jews free it set them all free the very thing that looked like it was going to be their destruction was the very thing that was their deliverance and it was the destruction of their enemies this continues on and as i began to think this through i remember the scripture in proverbs it says whosoever diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth the stone it will return upon him amen and the devil goes out and tries to destroy god's elected children and all it does is destroy himself so we just can't forget that these pathways that many times god takes us down it's not for our destruction everyone just relax stir yourself up in the lord and remember what he's done for you yes it's not him that willeth or him that runeth but it's god that showed you mercy the bible says here um i wanted to go to the scripture here in uh psalms 20. it says now know i that the lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots some in horses but we will remember the name of the lord they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright it's a very simple thought but wow it's a powerful one yes it is if you just remember what did he do for you what did he do for us and so as i began to continue to ponder on this and i began to look here at our own assembly and i would like brother franco if it's okay if you could bring forth a powerpoint and uh so many times like i said earlier we're wanting god to stir us up amen and i think we're supposed to be stirring ourselves up in the lord i think we're supposed to be looking at the promises of god and what he's done for us and it's hard to look at how big he is and all he's done for you and you not get excited about serving the lord and being one of his elect because from the same pulpit if you all remember many years ago there was the um tearing down i would say of the things that we hold so dear respectfully saying those things but we all know those things and in our church here um from this pulpit the things that we hold so dear we're just we're being destroyed and dismantled before our very eyes this is no disrespect but this is home this is family for a second you know we're just talking personal but i'm so glad that god would restore he wouldn't forget about us don't think for a second god's forgotten and i just wanted to bring this back to your attention that many years ago there was quite a move quite a move to try to discredit and destroy everything that we hold dear from this very sacred holy spot and it i find it quite interesting that the focus of the attention was upon what was taken place right here in 1963 it was published in may 17th and it happened on february 28 28 days and this was the big point of contention and for some reason this was the point of attack it must be that this is a pretty big deal it must mean that there's something behind this right here that you cannot miss it must mean that this is the capping stone it must mean that this is the thing that'll melt it all together bring the whole mystery the whole mystery plan the whole mystery plan of redemption into view right here and i find it interesting i'll stop for a second here i had i'd gotten a book from the uh from from goodwill it was a big old book and it was the book of history of america for the last hundred years and i began to look through that book and you i couldn't let my daughters look at it it was too graphic it was too horrific if you look at the history of united states in the last hundred years it's a pretty sickening thing to look at you look at the death you look at the destruction you look at the murder you look at the social things that have taken place you see a systematic ripping apart of families and of of the things that god said in order to keep thing all together it's just horrible and it's the entire story of death it's a history and a declaration of death but when god came down in 1963 he decided he was going to not go in those kind of history books he's going to show up in life magazine because this was not a sign or a history point in time we could say that was the time of destruction no this was a point of life this was the thing that was going to bring life in for everybody else to be set free this is a really big deal a very very big deal and brother branham your prophet said this is the vindication of my ministry that this message is the truth so i want to call back to your remembrance what god did for us because from this pulpit a subtle enemy began to work and he began to systematically destroy the very things that we hold dear but god wouldn't let it stand he was not going to let it be destroyed and from this pulpit a sermon was preached saying that was caused by a thor rocket and it's not what we think it is and basically the prophet spoke wrong okay that's that's your opinion and uh so from this pulpit that happened and i want to bring back to you remember in something it was on may 16 2012 10 years ago now time flies but let's not forget to may 16 2012 this cloud was from this pulpit called that it was caused by a thor rocket uh june 29th the next month a huge storm comes through lima with straight-line winds and literally almost rips the roof off of this church and you all know about this it compromised our entire roof system and it caused it to start leaking in here and there used to be we all know that who was here back then there was water leaks everywhere but what's so interesting about that there became a a bit of an issue with the insurance companies and the installers that installed it and there wasn't going to be any money handed out to fix the problem so it sat leaking for two years on may 7 2014 two years later a gentleman who had his opinion about what this cloud was resigned from this position and no disregard to demand but when he resigned the next day all the repairs to our roof system that were being battled out with insurance companies was finalized and fixed and sealed and buttoned up the very next day don't forget it was also that same week that we got all new lighting in here that's why i can barely see anything up there it's very bright but it made it bright everything became illuminated everything became much much clearer to see and then it was august 10th that by god's grace god came down and vindicated himself not a man but god amen no disregard you brother chad i don't think you have a problem he's saying that but god uses vessels to vindicate his word and god just used our brother chad to bring back into remembrance no no no no this is not a thor rocket this is the mighty hand of god i saw a cloud the size of a man's hand but i hear an abundance of rain behind it you know you could laugh at it you can make fun of it you could say there's nothing to it that's fine that's your opinion all right but for me i've heard and i have seen i once heard but now i see and i'm feeling the effects of the abundance of rain that followed that cloud that came back through how many of you did none of us could deny what happened none of us could deny that this word became a living word it became a living reality that the word of god was becoming something that was such a thrill to us again here was a man that was destroying the altars but remember god brought a man on the scene one time by the name of elijah and he rebuilt the altar and when he fully obeyed the word of god and he put all the stones back where they were he could step back he didn't have to do anything anymore because god himself would vindicate this to be the truth and god himself vindicated he was here he was in our presence and he was defending himself we don't have to defend him i don't have to argue fuss debate with anybody god vindicates his word my only obligation is to believe it amen and remember the mighty hand of god that has brought us through time and time and time again so bcf little flock that uh assembles here do you remember what he did don't let it become a common thing because that was not common you think it's all by accident that the roof couldn't get fixed you think by accident it had to be the roof that was compromised why the roof why the capping of this building why the very thing that keeps it all sheltered and held together and protected from the elements why that it had to be that it had to be that and that's what had to be fixed when the word was put back in its place when god was back in his position then we could rejoice and we all felt the effects of that abundance of rain that came behind it didn't we i sure did i certainly certainly did and so in just looking at this i didn't even use the powerpoint brother franco i'm sorry so i forgot it was there honestly but we all know what this is he says turn it to the right i heard a voice said turn it to the right he said that's our lord up there see that's not just a picture that's our lord up there that's the vindication of this message that's the vindication that god did not forget about us he didn't forget about us he paid a price 2000 years ago but it was time to redeem the thing he paid the price for he didn't forget about me behold i send you kyle elijah the prophet i'm reading my name into it because i'm a part of it that's mine you can argue you can debate you can fuss you can stay grounded on the things of the earth i'm sorry i'm looking up a little bit higher i see a cloud and i hear an abundance of rain and i'm getting caught up into it every day by his grace so behind this cloud we all remember there was a rainbow covenant and i'd like you to look if you don't mind oh no i have it in here brother franco see i'm all a mess but this rainbow covenant it was over the cloud and we saw in revelations 10 7 a mighty angel that descended out of heaven with a cloud above his head don't forget he remembered his promise to you he's coming to redeem his promise and bring you back into your perfect view and it says here brother ban i thought maybe the voice means turn it to turn it to the right and when i did i seen the hoffman's head of christ at 33. here look in here see his black beard his face his nose his eyes his nose everything else see the part of his hair here coming up and his wit his his wig with a white angel wig to show that this message of him being god is the truth he is the supreme judge of the universe supreme judge of heaven and earth he is god and nothing else but god he is god expressed in human form called the son of god which is the sun and which the sun was a mask and if we don't make our message exactly right identified by the scripture identified in service identified by his presence the same yesterday today and forever therefore those seven seals are the truth brethren amen to me i'm rejoicing in this promise that god did not forsake us he could have but he didn't it's not our merit it's not anything we did right there's none of us that did anything right it was his grace it was all grace grace to you grace to me he didn't have to but he did i'm so glad that he did he must have had a couple hebrew children he's going to let him get right up to the fiery furnace he's going to make it look like this thing is done it's destroyed and it's over but don't worry i'm going to come deliver my children myself and the presence of the fourth man has been clearly revealed amongst us speaking to our needs i told you this is a strange church this is a church when you come and you ask a question god speaks back yes amen this is the presence of god unveiled before your very eyes hidden in simplicity but yet speaking nonetheless and those seven stars that were in his hand and i just was reminded of elijah there on that showdown i love how elijah he just did what the word told him to do nothing more never added anything never took anything away he just said lord i've done all you told me to do and god himself vindicated it he vindicated that he was god that this was his message and what he said was or this was his messenger and what he said was the truth god himself vindicated and then he goes to pray because he said i hear an abundance of rain coming and then he has gaza his his servant go up there and he has to go up seven times and on the seventh time and remember geheza eventually backslides he's stricken with leprosy because he he cares he cares too much about money and popularity so he didn't even believe fully this message because he went up there and says i just see a little cloud the size of a man's hand oh elijah says ah no i hear an abundance of rain behind that cloud you don't realize what's behind that cloud no that's the confirmation that this message is the truth and so that you look at that pillar of fire above the the head of brother branham i don't know maybe it's just me but it also looks like a hand at an angle and i look at the other side and i know brother chad even preached on the seven stars in the hand of god so it's fitting that it's the hand of god upon his seventh angel messenger his seventh star sorry i'm getting excited remembering what god's been doing in my age i'm sorry sorry okay at the end of the day sports don't excite me football don't excite me nothing else excites me this stuff excites me guys here i am laying on a roof 22 years ago saying lord if i know where you are whatever mountain you're on i'll forsake all and go climb that mountain by god's grace i've been climbing i've been i didn't realize i was climbing climbing mount sunset seeing the revelation of the mystery of god unveiled in my hour where the very headship of god himself the word is coming back and uniting with the bride and isn't it interesting you know there's sometimes a debate on whether or not this is the coming of the lord can i just throw out a little thought maybe i'm wrong this is me but just moving by inspiration here for a second but when god came to abraham and he said i am going to visit you according to the time of life he first gave the word and then the manifestation of the word to follow when god said in genesis 1 let there be light what was that the word but when the light sprang forth there it was the manifestation of the promise that he made and so what god said in 1963 the coming of the lord the revealing of the seven seals and the mysteries of god made known a perfect interpretation of the word of god it was his coming and now the manifestation of the word i'm looking at it every single day the seventh seal is being unveiled every single day it's peeling back the mystery of my life and of your life and you're finding yourself as part of the mystery of god that was hidden from the foundation of the world and so oh can i keep going for a second i'm sorry i'm really done i don't have any more notes but i'd like to go for just a moment i remember i was speaking at my grandma's funeral and i was trying to think of what i would say and i i i was looking at and i had been handed an obituary from the funeral home and the obituary you always seen in a picture it's a picture of a face with a name then if you go and you read the story the mystery of the person is unveiled and so when i looked at that picture and i began to read the min the mystery of this person first it was a name but then i found out they were born at a certain time and they had these certain chil this this mother and this father they were a daughter and then as the mystery continues to unveil of this person they became a wife and then as the mystery continues to unveil it they realize they're a mother they have children and the ministry continued to unveil they were a grandmother and this was their purpose and this is what they did and it so did something to me because i realized in this natural life when someone's picture goes in a newspaper it's the end of something but when a famous person and i looked up obituaries i looked up that what is an obituary and the by and uh google is there's a certain like a funeral said what is a proper obituary well a proper obituary must contain the name of the individual what uh part of the family they were in what was the full extent of the family who is all in the family and uh what was their purpose what were the things that interested them in their life right okay and where the funeral arrangements will be held and but it says in in parentheses it says but for someone famous usually you will find their obituary in nationally publicized publications i said well praise god god god didn't show the cloud and lima lima news he came to life magazine because he had to vindicate this isn't a death this isn't an ending this is a beginning what people will realize as time goes on that that cloud was signifying the beginning of something not the ending of something we're not looking back at a cloud from 50 years ago saying well that was a wonderful event no that cloud is now defining my purpose on this earth that cloud is now defining my everyday motive my objective where i'm going what i'm doing because i found out when i was understanding the mystery that was unfolding behind this name of jesus christ i found out he had a family and as i started to peel back the mystery of jesus christ i found out hey he had a son and that son was me and so on unveiling the mystery of that cloud right there i unveiled the mystery of my life and you've been unveiled in the mystery of your life and why you pecul cool your birth and why you had the parents you had and why you ended up here and why you just happened to have brother chad a friend out in cincinnati called jeremy sanders you know and why did he have to have this kind of a friend why couldn't he have different friends no it had to be that friend at that time at that moment and that friend had to tell you about something that was going to quicken a seed your peculiar life your misunderstood life your questions shouldn't have any god knows exactly what he's doing so just go back and remember what he did for you amen it's all had a purpose all along the way this isn't done it's just begun i don't care what anybody says i don't care what scoffers may say i don't care if there's a it doesn't matter to me anymore it really doesn't matter i'm moving on i'm going because i already got caught up into it i already got caught up into it i'm sorry it's too late for me you'll have to work on somebody else and i remember this in genesis i stumbled across it and god said this is a token of my covenant which i'm i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations i do set my bow in a cl in the cloud and it shall be a token of a covenant between me and the earth and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that a bow shall be seen in the cloud and i will remember my covenant and so god didn't forget god knew what he was doing the most sublime scripture in all the bible revelations 5 when a bloody lamb would come and take the book and loose the seals and unveil the mystery that he had hid for 2 000 years that god himself was going to unite himself with man again and she'll be a prisoner a love slave to his word and his word only living simple humble christian lives but love slaves prisoners to his word and his word only musicians will you come praise god i would like to just um share i'll finish with that one but i want to read you this for a second testimony as i stood there watching them they got closer and closer and they turned and walked out in the woods and i just stood there just dumbfounded this is a story when brother branham was in the woods and he had a i think there was a couple three deer that came up before him if i remember the story right and he could have shot all three deer but he had told god he knew that bothered god he knew that he didn't like that because he was shooting dear for all of his friends and if you know anything about brother branham you know he had some complexes he loved the affection of people he loved people he had been rejected from his entire childhood made fun of as a boy he had those scars in his life you know but he had remembered a promise that he made to god he said i won't do that no more and here he got up in this the mountains and he had the perfect opportunity three deer standing right in front of me said i could shoot them all in three seconds they'd all be mine one for brother woods one for another brother and one for himself and when i and and they went away and the voice spoke down down again and the sun was shining on my back he said you remembered your promise didn't you i said yes lord i remembered my promise i know that's you and i can't see you lord but i know you're here somewhere i said i don't see you but i hear your voice i know you're here said you kept your promise you re sorry you you remembered your promise you remembered your promise sorry you remembered me yes um and i remembered mine too i'll never leave you nor forsake you see it's not just when i remember my promise to god but oh when he remembers his promise to me that means the world to me to know that i stood for his word he'll stand for me that's all i can do i don't know how to do anything else honestly as i'm getting older i'm realizing i'm just a miserable failure at everything anyhow i really can't do anything right anyhow the only thing that's been right was the grace of god that helped me in this life to see the truth in this hour and i ain't taking it for granted it means everything to me notice in colossians the 18th verse in the book of colossians it says now he is the head of the church the body who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in that in all things he might have the preeminences he is the head of the church which is his body and he and he wants his preeminences now listen close while we're going what he is going to be the head of the body his bride's body which is taken from him flesh and bone like in adam the bride born from the dead sea that's born from the dead sin of unbelief what killed eve unbelief is that right their unbelief in what by for in unbelief in god no she had faith in god sure did she say there is no god no sir she wasn't an infidel well she said you know i don't believe his word at all no no she believed all but one little thing amen that's all it took god wanted the preeminences and god is gaining the preeminences will you stand with me so i delivered my soul i don't know what to tell you i i have nothing more to say everything's that needed to be said i think has been said um he didn't tell me to go south or or west or anything but i hope you're encouraged i love you all very very much stir yourself up in the lord parents go home and talk to your kids tell them about the stones that were built up where god delivered you i think it'll be a tremendous thing sometimes i think we overthink this thing i think you really just need to testify and tell of what he did for you let him see the life that was manifested for you by his grace let him let them see i think in my my own opinion i let them see the mighty hand of god the right hand of god that delivered you time and time again and they can sit back one of these days when they come up to a red sea and they'll say you know what i remember this story before like david i remember this when they can't figure out where to go i remember my dad told me a story one time that it looked like he was led right up to the red sea but god took him right through the red sea he couldn't see his footsteps but god delivered him and then they'll be having encouraging and then they'll start talking like david talked about when they remembered when they remembered i'm so glad god remembered i'm so glad i don't know why i just want to say that it's just it's not that we just it's not that we remembered god it's that god remembered us it's god that remembered us let's just have a word of prayer father thank you i don't know what other words we could say but thank you lord how you've watched over us how you've protected us how you've guided us like a shepherd with the little sheep lord we couldn't lead ourselves we had no strength and ability of our own lord we were lost in a lost and dying world and what we thought was our strength our abilities was just our weakness father the greatest strength that we have is to be able to be humbled and be made weak and just trust the mighty hand of god that has led us safe this far father i just want to thank you i thank you lord for talking to me from a kid lord those little inspirations that used to put in my heart that used to come out i'm so glad there was a deep calling so there had to be a deep to respond i'm so glad for it lord i think we all are we can look back to see the mighty hand of god that delivered us and lord no matter what the situation that is before us no matter how dark and dim and foggy it looks ahead of us father may we just go back and remember this is part of the plan you love to test your children you love to see what you really mean to them lord we're a people that know that we have received of you by your grace and we know that that mighty hand is still with us so father god thank you thank you so much from everything we got in our hearts thank you for leading us as a people thank you for protecting us and lord we believe we're pressing on lord you're leading us lord by your grace be with everyone mother father child young person old person lord lord continue to unveil the mystery of your purpose and your coming in us lord we love you we commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen god bless you all it was an honor as always i sure appreciate being able to stand with the people who love the lord more than their own lives it's really an honor in this day and age with so many distractions to have a people that can rejoice in what god is doing i really
