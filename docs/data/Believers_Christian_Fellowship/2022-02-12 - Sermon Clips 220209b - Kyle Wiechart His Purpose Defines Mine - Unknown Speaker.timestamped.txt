[0:00] so i cannot pursue my will and his will
[0:02] at the same time
[0:03] i'll be unstable in all my ways
[0:06] i have to put one purpose before me and
[0:08] i have to make sure that i block
[0:10] everything else that tries to stop that
[0:13] to see that come to pass i have
[0:15] something i've got to do
[0:17] every father in a home knows this
[0:18] situation you don't just sit back and
[0:21] and trust that everything in your home
[0:22] goes all right every father has to stand
[0:24] up and be a man take control of his home
[0:26] and say this isn't according to god's
[0:28] will
[0:29] this this situation how we handled this
[0:31] with the children that wasn't according
[0:32] to god's will i have to take control of
[0:34] my own home with my own children and if
[0:36] anything goes wrong in my own home guess
[0:38] whose fault it was mine
[0:39] so a father has a responsibility to his
[0:41] wife and to his children to see to it
[0:43] that his home is reflecting christ the
[0:44] way christ would want it to be reflected
[0:46] right
[0:48] a young man
[0:49] would have to live his life he knows how
[0:50] to has to be able to control his life
[0:52] and control his desires in such a way
[0:54] that if god looked into the secrets of
[0:56] his life he could say this is a young
[0:57] man that's reflecting me the way i want
[0:59] to be reflected
[1:00] you can look to a wife and say hey
[1:02] here's an unbelieving husband but this
[1:03] wife is so purposed in her heart to see
[1:05] christ reflected in her that now she
[1:07] handles her husband in the right way
[1:09] though he may not be serving god it
[1:10] doesn't matter you're serving god
[1:13] the wife serves god the wife reflects
[1:15] christ the way god christ wants to
[1:16] reflect regardless of the husband's
[1:17] situation
[1:19] you know she has to purpose in herself
[1:20] to do that
[1:22] you see what i'm saying nobody's off the
[1:24] hook
[1:25] everybody has a place to play everybody
[1:27] has uh everybody's a wash woman
[1:29] somewhere with a purposeful washed woman
[1:31] somewhere
[1:32] god has a custom-made circumstance and
[1:35] situation that he just so placed you in
[1:37] to see the glory of god manifested in
[1:39] you maybe you're the only one that can
[1:41] do it
[1:42] maybe you're the only one that could
[1:43] really reflect christ in the situation
[1:45] you find yourself in to the the way he
[1:47] would want it to be reflected
