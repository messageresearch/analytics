[8:57] then we are subjects to yield to God's
[9:00] spirit as long as we think that we can
[9:04] do it then we can't do it
[9:06] but when we get to a place where we know
[9:08] we can't do it then we yield ourselves
[9:11] to God and he does it
[9:13] so then if it's us trying to do it we'll
[9:16] fail
[9:17] but if we'll just yield ourselves to God
[9:20] then God can't fail

[19:50] was so thankful for the hour in which
[19:52] you've allowed us to live Lord where you
[19:54] have taken the veil off of the great
[19:56] mystery of your book
[19:58] and Lord you've taken the veil off of
[20:00] our lives and you've drawn us to
[20:03] yourself Lord in a deeper relationship
[20:05] well we want that to go deeper and

[20:42] Lord live in each one of us express
[20:45] yourself today through your word may
[20:47] that word drop into our hearts and take
[20:49] root and bring forth fruit we commit
[20:52] ourselves to you we commit this service
[20:54] to you we ask that you would take
[20:55] preeminence Among Us in Jesus Christ's
[20:58] name we pray amen amen God bless you all
[21:02] certainly good to be here with you this
[21:05] morning if what we're standing if you
[21:07] could turn in your Bibles to the Book of
[21:08] Genesis we'll begin at the beginning
[21:11] amen
[21:12] so we'll look at the Book of Genesis
[21:14] chapter one I just want to make two
[21:17] announcements uh first to let you all
[21:19] know that this coming Sunday April 2nd
[21:22] brother Samuel valwalk will be here
[21:24] ministering for us and that's brother
[21:25] yatzik's son Samuel he was with us about
[21:27] a year ago if you'll remember him so
[21:29] he'll be here this Sunday and then the
[21:31] following Sunday is Easter so Easter
[21:34] Sunday brother Roshan Massey from India
[21:36] will be here and he'll be ministering
[21:37] that Sunday and he's staying for uh
[21:40] several days for about a week so he'll
[21:42] be ministering Sunday and that Wednesday
[21:43] I've asked him to take both services so
[21:46] be in prayer for that as well
[21:49] I mean let's let's look here Genesis
[21:51] chapter 1 verse 26 we'll read just two
[21:53] verses and let you have your seats
[21:55] Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and God said
[21:59] let us make man in our image after our
[22:01] likeness and let them have dominion over
[22:03] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[22:06] the air and over the cattle and over all
[22:08] the Earth and over every creeping thing
[22:09] that creepeth upon the Earth so God
[22:12] created man in his own image in the
[22:14] image of God created he him male and
[22:16] female created he them man God bless you
[22:20] as your seeden
[22:22] keep your place in the scripture there
[22:24] we'll read that again and not that it's
[22:26] an unfamiliar portion of scripture we
[22:28] know it quite well preached from it many
[22:30] times but you know we live in such a day
[22:33] under the message of the hour that the
[22:35] veil has been taken off and all of these
[22:38] things have so much more meaning and the
[22:40] more we look at it the more it grows
[22:42] amen but I'd like to give you uh just a
[22:44] report back from Friday night service
[22:46] I'd spoke to you Wednesday and let you
[22:48] know that we were going over to Holmes
[22:50] County to have a baptismal service and
[22:53] it was really a wonderful time I went
[22:55] over there and brother Jonathan
[22:57] Baumgartner rode with me Brother Kyle
[22:59] Weichert they wrote over there with me
[23:01] and then it was amazing because brother
[23:05] John small called and said hey I'm going
[23:07] to be over there picking up material
[23:08] that day on Friday would it be okay if I
[23:11] stopped by and I should sure be fine so
[23:14] what was interesting is when when Friday
[23:16] uh morning I think it was Levi texted me
[23:19] and says hey have you worked out
[23:21] something or can you work out something
[23:22] for a song leader for tonight and I said
[23:24] yeah I think I think it's already worked
[23:27] out so praise God that worked out really
[23:30] good to Brother John and his wife were
[23:32] there and he led the songs there was a
[23:35] man there by the name of Arley stutzman
[23:37] Arley stutzman had recently left the
[23:39] Amish church and he had gotten contact
[23:43] with Levi Yoder through his sister his
[23:46] sister had given him Levi's number and
[23:48] Levi had started witnessing to him and
[23:50] Sharon the message with him gave him
[23:52] some material he was reading they were
[23:55] they did bible study on I think the
[23:57] water baptism
[23:59] and Arley just saw it he just instantly
[24:02] saw it and he knew it was right and he
[24:04] wanted to be baptized in the name of the
[24:06] Lord Jesus Christ so he he wanted to do
[24:08] it right away so that's when Levi put
[24:10] this together and then hardly invited
[24:12] about uh some of his friends and family
[24:15] and I think he had about eight or nine
[24:17] guests there that he had invited and
[24:19] then there was us from the church
[24:20] brother Levi and his family and some
[24:23] other friends and so we just did a
[24:26] service on water baptism in the name of
[24:28] the Lord Jesus Christ and we had I had
[24:31] the most fun I've had in a long time
[24:33] just going back to what for us is a
[24:36] fundamental basic truth but just to go
[24:39] back through the scriptures and see how
[24:41] solidly we've been placed in the word by
[24:44] this message
[24:45] I mean with unquestionable doubt you go
[24:48] through the scriptures and see what was
[24:50] the faith that was once delivered to the
[24:52] to the Saints this is it amen we've been
[24:55] returned back to the apostles Doctrine
[24:57] and so I had a I had fun studying and I
[24:59] had to find preparing it and it was very
[25:02] very well received everybody had Open
[25:04] Hearts many of arly's family have
[25:06] already left the Amish church and their
[25:09] their fellowshipping in different places
[25:11] in different ways but they had uh we had
[25:14] an excellent time excellent reception
[25:16] wonderful baptism and uh everybody just
[25:20] stood around in Fellowship for a long
[25:22] time afterwards we had a great time and
[25:25] Arlie wants to come and visit the church
[25:27] and his his sister and his
[25:30] brother-in-law uh they they said they
[25:33] wanted to come Levi had been inviting
[25:34] them so I expect to see him sometime he
[25:36] told me he says we want to come we'll
[25:38] see you as the Lord leads we'll see you
[25:40] sometimes so I pray that you all get
[25:43] acquainted with brother Arley and with
[25:45] his family there so I appreciate you all
[25:47] praying it was really wonderful there's
[25:50] something about fresh ears
[25:52] I mean we've heard we've been so blessed
[25:55] we've had so much spiritual food we've
[25:58] been on such a spiritual diet by what
[26:00] God has given to us I'm just so thankful
[26:03] that that somebody else got to hear amen
[26:05] it does something for me and I enjoyed
[26:07] it so I appreciate you praying about
[26:09] that and many of you asked about it and
[26:12] God was good
[26:14] so if they show up you have to meet
[26:16] brother Arley if he shows up sometime in
[26:19] the next few weeks amen so as we look
[26:22] into the Bible this morning we look into
[26:24] this scripture here all the way back in
[26:26] Genesis and we know this really well
[26:28] that that God made Man In His Image he
[26:30] made them male and female and the image
[26:32] of God made he them we know that and one
[26:36] thing that I love about the the
[26:38] revelation of the word in this hour is
[26:41] God God is wanting us to know him
[26:45] he's revealing so much of his word
[26:48] because he is the word and as he takes
[26:50] the veil off the word he's unveiling
[26:52] himself because God wants to be drawn
[26:54] into a deeper relationship amen and so
[26:57] in order to have a deeper relationship a
[26:59] deeper Fellowship he must unveil himself
[27:01] because without the unveiling of God
[27:03] there's a certain distance that that
[27:06] that blindness creates a certain
[27:08] distance that ignorance creates and it's
[27:10] the same thing true in our lives if we
[27:13] want to get to know somebody you have to
[27:15] get to know somebody if you want to draw
[27:16] closer to them and move into a deeper
[27:18] relationship you have to get to know
[27:20] them and there has to be a certain Veil
[27:22] taking away and a certain Revelation
[27:25] that comes forward and if we want to be
[27:27] friends with somebody you have to get to
[27:29] know them to be friends you can't be
[27:30] friends with somebody you don't know
[27:31] anything about
[27:33] you say oh that's a good friend of mine
[27:34] where do they live I don't know what's
[27:36] their name I don't know what do you know
[27:38] I just know he's a good friend
[27:40] but but gone
[27:42] uh did this and and one thing I I I I
[27:47] look at sometimes is so many times we
[27:51] view the word of God through our
[27:53] perspective our lens we're standing on
[27:55] Earth looking up and that's always the
[27:57] perspective we've had but by the grace
[27:59] of God the message has taken us to the
[28:01] other side back to God's mind and from
[28:04] God's mind looking down amen and it
[28:06] gives us a total different perspective
[28:08] on why the Bible's written the way it's
[28:10] written and why God did the things that
[28:12] he did so for us and we're always on
[28:15] this side of the equation looking up
[28:16] wanting to know about God and God's on
[28:19] the other side wanting to reveal himself
[28:21] so he can be known
[28:24] amen the prophet of God said in the
[28:26] message who's this Melchizedek he said
[28:28] God came down and became flesh and died
[28:30] to death in Christ so that he could
[28:33] clean the church in order to get into it
[28:35] for Fellowship
[28:36] God loves Fellowship
[28:39] that's what he made the man at the first
[28:41] time for was for Fellowship God dwells
[28:43] alone with cherubims so now we get a
[28:46] little insight into God and what's going
[28:48] on in Genesis God had created all the
[28:51] Heavenly hosts he created the cherubims
[28:53] the seraphims all the Angels they
[28:55] worshiped him he was God Amen because
[28:57] God is an object of worship and so being
[29:00] worshiped in the Heavenly realm he had
[29:02] subjects he had those that would obey
[29:04] his law he had those that would worship
[29:06] him he was the great ruler of the
[29:09] heavens and he he was adored and he was
[29:11] worshiped and he was obeyed
[29:14] but now God is is now furthering his
[29:18] work of creation and he's coming to the
[29:19] Earth and he's fashioning the Earth in a
[29:22] certain way and now he's making
[29:24] something on the earth he comes all the
[29:26] way through creation and he comes to the
[29:28] point where now he's putting something
[29:30] on the earth that reflects him
[29:32] he's putting his reflection on the earth
[29:34] he's making Man In His Image and and now
[29:37] God there's a reason that he's doing
[29:39] this and and and to me God wanted more
[29:43] than just to be an object of worship
[29:46] because if all he wanted was to be an
[29:48] object of worship he already had that
[29:50] before we get to this place
[29:52] so now God is expressing more of himself
[29:55] in the word he he in himself has greater
[29:58] desires than just to be an object of
[30:00] worship
[30:02] just to be a great deity who is obeyed
[30:05] he must have more desire than that
[30:08] because now he's doing more work than
[30:10] that
[30:11] so now we look at what he's doing
[30:14] and he says now in the beginning when
[30:16] God came down in the evening and talked
[30:18] to Adam and Eve in the cool of the day
[30:20] and his great voice whispered to them
[30:22] and they had to Fellowship love one to
[30:24] another how the moving of the spirit
[30:26] went through the bushes the lions come
[30:28] up the Tigers all of them they worshiped
[30:30] the Lord man was conscious at all times
[30:32] that his presence was with him
[30:34] man in the Garden of Eden had God
[30:37] walking with him he had he had
[30:39] fellowship and that's what God wanted
[30:41] God wanted Fellowship
[30:44] so we we know this we we've we've been
[30:46] through this we've talked about this
[30:48] amen God wasn't just creating more
[30:50] subjects to adore him and worship him he
[30:52] was creating people that he would come
[30:54] down and walk with amen and he would
[30:56] fellowship with them and talk with them
[30:58] and share his life with them
[31:00] but then we get to Genesis chapter 3.
[31:04] and let's look here in Genesis chapter
[31:06] 3.
[31:13] and I forgot to give you my subject a
[31:16] title for a subject is a personal God
[31:19] a personal God
[31:22] in Genesis chapter 3 verse 8.
[31:26] and they've heard the voice of the Lord
[31:28] God Walking In The Garden in the cool of
[31:30] the day and Adam and his wife hid
[31:32] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[31:34] God amongst the Trees of the garden
[31:37] and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[31:39] said unto him where art thou
[31:42] and we know we got to this condition
[31:44] because they listened to the serpent
[31:46] they fell they found themselves naked
[31:48] they made fig leaves now God comes down
[31:50] and they heard the voice of God in the
[31:53] garden
[31:54] and they hid themselves from God they
[31:56] had never done this before they never
[31:57] hid from God they'd always run up to God
[31:59] and had fellowship with God and that was
[32:01] God's pleasure that was God's desire
[32:03] remember when God made Eden Eden means
[32:06] pleasure it was God's pleasure amen it
[32:08] was God's design it was God's desire it
[32:11] was what he wanted and then he put a
[32:12] reflection of himself in the garden and
[32:15] he come down and he Fellowship that was
[32:17] God's desire amen remember it was not
[32:19] man's desire it was God's desire
[32:22] this wasn't man's idea we didn't come up
[32:24] with this concept and this idea God did
[32:27] this is what God wanted
[32:30] and so now now all of a sudden something
[32:33] has changed and now instead of running
[32:35] to God they're hiding from God but look
[32:37] it says God God says and the Lord God
[32:40] called unto Adam and said unto him where
[32:42] art thou remember it's God calling man
[32:45] man has never sought out God God has
[32:47] always sought out man
[32:49] it was God who came looking amen none of
[32:52] the disciples chose Christ chose every
[32:55] one of them he even says you have not
[32:57] chosen me but I have chosen you amen and
[33:00] I have called you and I've ordained you
[33:01] it is God calling man not man looking
[33:05] out for trying to find God Amen God and
[33:08] Jesus said no man can come to me lest
[33:10] the father draw him first it's God who
[33:13] wants man more than man wants God
[33:17] is that right
[33:18] from from our perspective when we've
[33:21] been down on Earth for generations for
[33:23] thousands of years looking up amen man
[33:25] has thought that he wanted God and he
[33:27] wanted to find God and he wanted to get
[33:29] God Amen that's impossible unless God
[33:32] first wanted man
[33:34] and he wanted fellowship with man that's
[33:36] the reason man wants fellowship with God
[33:38] is because God first wanted fellowship
[33:40] with man
[33:41] all of our desire is a reciprocation of
[33:44] his
[33:46] so now we find that for the first time
[33:49] they're hiding from God and running from
[33:52] God and separated from God but God is
[33:55] still Desiring Adam and he's still
[33:58] looking and calling for Adam God doesn't
[34:00] say oh they fell and as if God didn't
[34:02] know I mean God's not down there on a
[34:04] discovery Mission trying to find out
[34:06] what happened God already knows what
[34:07] happened he's down there calling for
[34:09] Adam because he wants to restore the
[34:11] broken Fellowship
[34:15] in Genesis chapter 3 verse 22 let's look
[34:18] at that now
[34:23] and the Lord God said behold the man has
[34:25] become as one of us to know good and
[34:27] evil and now lest he put forth his hand
[34:30] and take also the tree of life and eat
[34:31] and live forever therefore the Lord God
[34:33] sent him forth from the Garden of Eden
[34:35] to till the ground from whence he was
[34:38] taken now Fellowship is broken the the
[34:42] pleasure that they had in the Garden of
[34:44] Eden now the man is separated and he
[34:46] sent away and he's walking out of that
[34:49] place that he had
[34:51] and the prophet says now the love that
[34:53] he had for the human race and yet had to
[34:56] see them separated from him and the
[34:59] fellowship that he had with his children
[35:01] in the Garden of Eden in that
[35:03] heartbroken condition that he's had to
[35:05] be in all that time because his word
[35:08] said the day you eat thereof that day
[35:11] you die
[35:16] and you look at the heartbroken
[35:19] condition of Adam and his wife as they
[35:21] walk out of the Garden of Eden now
[35:23] clothed in bloody skins because God
[35:26] slayed an animal slayed a lamb Amen to
[35:28] cover for their sins and they're walking
[35:30] and now they're leaving Paradise they're
[35:32] leaving the presence of God they're
[35:33] walking into the world now he's earned
[35:36] earned bread by the sweat of his brow
[35:37] she's to bring forth children in sorrow
[35:39] now you see they're in a heartbroken
[35:41] condition but you could look at that and
[35:43] miss that God is in a heartbroken
[35:46] condition
[35:47] that God created man and God and had
[35:50] fellowship with man as his children in
[35:52] the garden God enjoyed the fellowship
[35:54] God had pleasure in the garden God
[35:57] wanted to walk with them
[36:00] and so man wasn't the only one who lost
[36:03] out in this fall God also but we know it
[36:06] all serves God's purpose and God knows
[36:08] what he's doing because Jesus Christ was
[36:10] the land slain from the foundation
[36:11] before the foundation of the world God
[36:13] knew that he was going to have broken
[36:15] Fellowship but God knew he was going to
[36:17] restore Fellowship
[36:20] because that's what God wanted there
[36:22] wouldn't have been a lamb slain from
[36:23] before the foundation of the world
[36:24] unless God wanted to restore Fellowship
[36:28] praise God
[36:30] so I mean if I could just say
[36:32] no matter how much we want God and we
[36:35] feel that we want God it's impossible
[36:37] unless he first wanted us and he wants
[36:39] us more than we want him
[36:41] so all that desire we have for God Amen
[36:44] that should encourage us amen because if
[36:46] we have a desire for God and a love for
[36:49] God and we want God it must mean he
[36:51] wants us amen
[36:53] praise God
[36:55] so I just want to look at this
[36:58] from the messiest things that wasn't so
[37:00] from the beginning
[37:02] it says can we make it
[37:04] we make it to a Creed and when God has
[37:06] no Creed God is a person
[37:10] I'd like to spend some time on this God
[37:11] is a person
[37:14] God dwells within his church and you are
[37:16] his church if you've been born again and
[37:18] filled with the Holy Ghost you are God's
[37:20] church God dwells in you
[37:23] you have so many thoughts about God but
[37:25] we realize God is a person
[37:28] and and God loves and he wants to be
[37:32] loved
[37:33] God has emotion God will look at these
[37:36] things in the scripture but but God is a
[37:39] person not just an object of worship he
[37:41] is an object of worship but he's a
[37:42] person
[37:44] amen he goes on to say God is a person
[37:46] God can speak God can talk God can write
[37:51] if you look through the Bible and look
[37:52] at how many times God came to people and
[37:55] began to relate to people and talk to
[37:57] people and Converse with people and save
[37:59] people the whole book is about people
[38:01] and God God and people God and his
[38:04] people
[38:06] I mean if we look at Psalms chapter
[38:07] seven let's look real quickly at two
[38:09] verses here Psalms chapter 7 verse 11.
[38:22] Psalms chapter 7.
[38:25] verse 11.
[38:32] I'm just going to touch two places to
[38:34] show what I'm talking about and then
[38:36] we'll move on uh Psalm 7 verse 11 God
[38:40] judges the righteous and God is angry
[38:42] with the wicked every day and so now I
[38:45] just want to show God gets angry God has
[38:47] emotion God can be angered God can be
[38:50] pleased
[38:52] let's go to Genesis chapter 6 now
[39:00] I'm just laying these in as a foundation
[39:01] so we could springboard and build off of
[39:03] this but I want to lay these things down
[39:06] solidly Genesis chapter 6 verse 6.
[39:11] and and we know this is the the fall of
[39:13] Man when we're coming to him calling
[39:15] Noah he sees wickedness in the earth and
[39:17] and verse 6 says and it repented the
[39:19] Lord that he had made man on the earth
[39:21] and it grieved him at his heart
[39:24] we've been through the scripture before
[39:25] but think about that it grieved him at
[39:28] his heart God can be grieved in his
[39:31] heart
[39:32] we're not the only ones with emotion God
[39:34] has emotion amen we're reflecting back
[39:37] God God can be angered God can be
[39:39] pleased God God can be grieved at his
[39:42] heart
[39:44] and I think it's good for us to know
[39:46] because God's Not A Sterile something
[39:49] far away an object of man's idea just an
[39:52] object to be uh of Adoration of worship
[39:55] that's far off unfeeling and cold and
[39:58] informal that's not God God is a person
[40:01] God feels God can be grieved in his
[40:03] heart he can he can feel pleasure amen
[40:05] he can enjoy Fellowship
[40:08] I think it's important for us to
[40:10] remember that
[40:14] uh
[40:16] God
[40:20] depressed is more than just
[40:22] the the
[40:23] object of worship or the great deity God
[40:27] wanted to be known as a father
[40:29] he wanted to be known as a brother
[40:32] he wanted to be known as a friend
[40:36] he wanted to be known as a husband
[40:39] these are all relationships
[40:42] amen this is God's desire
[40:44] let's look at James chapter 2.
[41:00] James chapter 2.
[41:04] I want to read verse 23 and then I'm
[41:07] going to quote from Isaiah James 2 23.
[41:13] and the scripture was fulfilled with
[41:15] saith Abraham believed God and it was
[41:17] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[41:19] he was called the friend of God so God
[41:23] can be a friend
[41:25] to me I I know that we know this we know
[41:28] the Bible but when you really stop and
[41:30] think about it it's a marvelous thought
[41:31] God can be a friend
[41:34] God can be a father God can be a brother
[41:36] God can be a friend he's so much more
[41:39] Dynamic than what religion has made him
[41:42] religion has made him the far off God
[41:44] who's up there he's decreed we worship
[41:47] we obey but that's not what God wanted
[41:49] God wanted to come down in the cool of
[41:52] the evening in the Garden of Eden and he
[41:54] wanted conversation and fellowship with
[41:56] his creation
[41:58] religion has made him a far-off distant
[42:00] deity but that's never what was in God's
[42:03] mind it was never his desire when God
[42:05] now starts to relate to his children
[42:07] he's a father there is children amen and
[42:10] he comes to them they don't go to him he
[42:13] comes to them because he wants to come
[42:15] to them
[42:16] because he desires to come to them to
[42:19] know them to reveal things to them for
[42:21] them to know him
[42:23] and now that Fellowship is broken and
[42:26] he's been in that heartbroken condition
[42:28] and then when he saw the evil of man it
[42:30] grieved him at his heart amen but he
[42:32] starts a restoration process to bring
[42:35] back that Fellowship that was lost in
[42:37] the Garden of Eden
[42:39] and we find ourselves in that
[42:41] restoration project of God
[42:44] amen
[42:45] but Isaiah 41 and 8. I'll just quote it
[42:48] to you Isaiah 41 and 8 says but thou
[42:50] Israel art my servant Jacob whom I have
[42:52] chosen the Seed of Abraham my friend
[42:56] I love this terminology because God now
[42:58] is speaking through the prophet Isaiah
[43:00] and he's saying you're the Seed of
[43:02] Abraham my friend Abraham didn't say
[43:05] God's my friend God said Abraham's my
[43:07] friend
[43:08] if God said Abraham's my friend that
[43:10] means God wanted to have a friend
[43:14] amen
[43:15] I hope we're seeing God way more Dynamic
[43:18] than just a religious deity
[43:21] amen
[43:23] so I I mean I don't know about you but I
[43:25] would love it if God would say Chad
[43:27] you're my friend
[43:29] that would change my feeling and
[43:31] thinking towards God not God says I am
[43:34] your God no you are my friend
[43:38] different
[43:40] and we know that Jesus tells his
[43:42] disciples I'll no longer call you
[43:43] servants but I call you friends
[43:46] and now friends
[43:48] but we know God Wants More Than Just a
[43:50] Friend
[43:51] and we live in the day where we realize
[43:53] God wants a wife
[43:55] amen and I I've said before your wife
[43:59] should be your friend
[44:01] but then she becomes more than a friend
[44:03] is that right your wife starts off as
[44:06] your friend and then she becomes your
[44:07] wife Jesus is speaking to disciples
[44:09] you're saying my friends but now in the
[44:11] end time we know that there's a call for
[44:12] a bride amen for the bride of Christ to
[44:15] be United with Christ because he's not
[44:17] sterile he's not far off he's not
[44:19] unfeeling he's not a great deity in the
[44:21] skies God is a person with emotion with
[44:24] feelings and he wants friends he wants a
[44:27] bride he wants to be United he wants to
[44:30] express himself to a being that can
[44:32] understand him and that could understand
[44:34] who he is and love him for who he is
[44:37] when when you as a man want a wife you
[44:41] want somebody that you can express
[44:43] yourself to that will understand you
[44:45] that has an expression back amen you
[44:47] don't want a wife and you don't want a
[44:49] cardboard cut out why if you don't want
[44:51] to be a cardboard cutout husband you're
[44:52] not looking for somebody to carry a
[44:54] title you're looking for a person to
[44:57] share your life with
[44:59] God's not looking for a church that'll
[45:01] be his church his subjects on Earth he's
[45:04] looking for a bride that will share his
[45:06] life
[45:07] he wants to share his very life his very
[45:10] person that's why he is given already of
[45:13] himself and portioned out his attributes
[45:15] so that they can come to expression and
[45:17] be United back to him in Fellowship
[45:21] God wants a wife
[45:23] he's a person
[45:25] he has feeling he has a desire amen
[45:31] in the smyrnan church age out of the
[45:33] church age book
[45:34] he says now according to the word of God
[45:36] the bride was chosen before the
[45:38] foundation of the world this choosing of
[45:40] the bride was purposed in himself in
[45:42] quotes Ephesians 1 9 and then then of
[45:46] course Romans 9 11 Romans 9 11 says that
[45:49] the purpose of God according to election
[45:51] might stand who chose he chose he chose
[45:55] because that's what he wanted amen if
[45:57] God chose you it's because he wants you
[46:00] listen it's not just that he felt sorry
[46:03] for you one day and you were reported no
[46:05] before the foundation of the world he
[46:06] chose you
[46:08] because he wants you not to say he'll be
[46:11] a subject that'll be obedient he'll do
[46:12] what I say no he wants Fellowship
[46:15] he wants you to be in fellowship with
[46:18] him
[46:21] says you can't read it any other way the
[46:23] heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God
[46:26] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[46:30] and that purpose was in himself and
[46:32] being Eternal was decreed before the
[46:34] foundation of the world what's the heart
[46:36] purpose of God to have a bride of his
[46:39] own choosing
[46:40] that's where we've come to that
[46:43] Revelation in this end time that should
[46:45] bring us into a closer Fellowship
[46:48] let's turn back to Genesis and look at
[46:50] Genesis chapter 2.
[46:52] I'm going to continue on just a minute
[46:54] with this story
[47:00] Genesis chapter 2.
[47:14] verse 18.
[47:16] and the Lord God said it is not good
[47:19] that man shall be alone I will make him
[47:21] a help meet for him
[47:23] we've been over this before but if
[47:25] you'll just allow me to cover some
[47:27] familiar ground again
[47:29] God says it's not good that man should
[47:32] dwell alone but it's a curious statement
[47:34] because God's the one who made him and
[47:36] put him in The Garden Alone
[47:37] so it's like whose fault is it that the
[47:40] man is in the garden by himself well
[47:42] obviously it's God's fault so when God
[47:44] says it's not good I mean it's not like
[47:46] God didn't know what he was doing and
[47:48] he's made a mistake he's God he's
[47:49] infinite his wisdom is perfect he does
[47:51] everything correctly so the the very
[47:53] language here is for us to ask the
[47:56] question why did he say that
[47:58] amen and the reason he said it is God
[48:00] has something else he wants to express
[48:02] when he's going to make Man In His Image
[48:04] and the image of God he made them male
[48:06] and female he made it he made them amen
[48:09] so now what he has is he has a son Adam
[48:12] all alone in the Garden of Eden and when
[48:14] God looks down he says it's not good
[48:17] that that man dwells alone because God
[48:19] is trying to reveal something of himself
[48:22] to us
[48:23] he's not making creation say oh whoops I
[48:26] made a mistake I left the part out oh
[48:28] goodness me I forgot
[48:30] God didn't forget God wants us to see
[48:33] what his great plan is
[48:36] so now we go into 19 and out of the
[48:38] ground the Lord God formed every beast
[48:40] of the field and every fount of the air
[48:41] and brought them unto Adam to see what
[48:43] he would call them and whatsoever Adam
[48:45] called every living creature that was
[48:47] the name thereof
[48:49] and Adam gave names to all cattle into
[48:51] the fowl of the air and to every beast
[48:53] of the field but for Adam there was not
[48:55] found a help meet for him and the Lord
[48:59] God caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[49:01] Adam and he slept and he took one of his
[49:03] ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[49:05] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[49:07] had taken from man made he a woman and
[49:09] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[49:12] this is now bone of my bones Flesh of My
[49:14] Flesh she shall be called woman because
[49:16] she was taken out of man therefore shall
[49:19] a man leave his father and his mother
[49:22] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[49:24] shall be one flesh
[49:27] amen this is what God is the very
[49:30] beginning of the Bible is he's laying
[49:32] down the pattern amen his desire what he
[49:35] wants to reveal he's laying down his
[49:37] Masterpiece his Masterpiece that the
[49:40] Great Master is working on and when he
[49:42] gets it done he takes his rest and he
[49:44] finds that it's all perfect and he rests
[49:46] but then the fall comes ruination comes
[49:49] to his Masterpiece and the rest of the
[49:51] Bible is God building back his
[49:53] masterpiece
[49:54] God bringing back this original image
[49:57] because this is what he wanted when he
[49:59] would come down in fellowship with his
[50:01] son and his son's wife amen so now God
[50:04] God God is showing us something and that
[50:07] gets ruined now he's building it back
[50:08] but what did he show us he showed us
[50:11] that it's not good that man dwell alone
[50:13] God says I will make man in my image in
[50:16] my reflection male and female so God
[50:19] says I'm making man after my image and
[50:22] I'm going to put him first alone God did
[50:25] it intentionally and when he was alone
[50:27] he's going to say it's not good that
[50:28] he's alone and now he needs to help me
[50:30] so I'm going to do some creative work
[50:33] and create all of these animals to come
[50:35] up but nothing in creation would meet
[50:38] the need of Adam
[50:41] nothing God why because God was alone in
[50:44] heaven and he made his creative work and
[50:46] cherubims and seraphims and Angels but
[50:49] none of the creation in heaven would
[50:51] meet his need the only thing that could
[50:53] meet his need was something that would
[50:55] come from inside of him
[50:58] so now in order to be the help me to
[51:00] meet the need of Adam amen when God said
[51:03] is not good the solution for the not
[51:06] good was not something else he could
[51:08] make the solution for the not good was
[51:10] something that was in Adam
[51:13] so God would pull out of Adam a rib take
[51:16] that feminist Spirit out of Adam create
[51:18] Adam's wife unite the two back together
[51:20] and after he unites the two it says all
[51:23] that he saw he saw all that he made and
[51:25] all that he had done and he said it is
[51:26] very good and he took his rest because
[51:28] now he's done
[51:30] until then he's not done
[51:32] and God in his Creations reflecting
[51:35] himself he was alone in the heavens amen
[51:38] he wanted Fellowship but he made these
[51:41] angels He made these cherubims he made
[51:43] the seraphims and they worshiped him as
[51:45] God making him an object of worship he
[51:47] was God they were subjects to him making
[51:51] him deity
[51:52] but yet he goes and does something more
[51:56] because God wants Fellowship what what
[52:00] was he going to fellowship with the
[52:01] children that would come out of him
[52:03] something that was in him
[52:05] the prophet says it this way in the
[52:07] Masterpiece and as he began to work upon
[52:10] creeping things the little animals upon
[52:12] the Earth and then he began to bring it
[52:13] from that into something else higher
[52:15] then finally he brought into the larger
[52:17] animals such as the lion the tiger the
[52:19] bear then he brought it into the life of
[52:21] maybe monkeys and apes and so forth now
[52:23] not in evolution as we think that one
[52:26] come from from the other that was a
[52:28] complete creation God working in a
[52:30] pattern and finally there came forth
[52:32] upon the earth a Perfection and that was
[52:34] a man and then he could see in that man
[52:38] that it looked like him so now when he
[52:41] looked upon him he was a reflection of
[52:43] what his creator was
[52:45] God had now been able to achieve the
[52:48] thing he had wanted a man in his own
[52:50] image and then I might say to this that
[52:53] when he made this man there was
[52:55] something about him yet that didn't look
[52:57] just right because he was by himself
[53:01] and that's how God had been by himself
[53:04] he was the Eternal and the man now in
[53:07] the image of God also existed in the
[53:09] Earth by himself so he must have struck
[53:11] a little blow over on his left side and
[53:14] from there he took the peace that struck
[53:15] off it and made him a help me you know
[53:17] why and then he wasn't by himself he had
[53:20] somebody with him and that that's his
[53:24] great work what's God's great work not
[53:27] that the man was alone but that the man
[53:29] and his wife were together that's the
[53:31] great work
[53:32] because that's what God wants
[53:34] and he has any sculptor would take his
[53:37] Masterpiece first he had a masterpiece
[53:39] of himself but now he's seen that the
[53:42] Masterpiece was lonesome like he was
[53:46] what a statement now the Masterpiece
[53:48] Adam was lonesome like he was who was
[53:51] the creator
[53:53] Adam was now reflecting God
[53:58] he was lonesome because God was lonesome
[54:00] because there was nothing there was
[54:02] nothing that could fellowship with God
[54:04] on the level that God wanted Fellowship
[54:08] not as a great deity not as a great God
[54:10] to be worshiped but he wanted somebody
[54:13] who understood him and Adam and all the
[54:15] creation didn't have another creature
[54:17] like him that understood him so God
[54:20] brought that creature out of him and
[54:22] United and now amen Adam had the
[54:25] fellowship he was longing for and it was
[54:27] the cure for his loneliness
[54:30] now God is doing the same thing
[54:33] God Amen has attributes within himself
[54:36] that he's bringing out as children amen
[54:38] and uniting them back to himself amen
[54:40] and God wants to have fellowship with
[54:42] creatures that are like him and
[54:44] understand him amen
[54:46] that's the day that we live in
[54:49] we don't live in the day of ignorance
[54:51] and partial now we live in the day when
[54:53] God is unveiling himself
[54:55] so that we can know him
[54:58] amen
[55:00] he goes on to say and Satan's Eden
[55:05] says so God knew that he would be here
[55:07] then he put us in flesh so that we would
[55:09] be contacted in an order he could
[55:11] contact
[55:12] he became one of us when he became Jesus
[55:14] Christ the son of God himself the
[55:16] fullness of the manifestation of God
[55:18] therefore that was God's purpose to
[55:21] display his attributes and fellowship
[55:24] he said as children of God we are part
[55:27] of God's attribute that was in him made
[55:28] flesh like he was made flesh so we can
[55:31] have Fellowship one with the other as a
[55:33] family of God upon the Earth and that
[55:35] was God's purpose at the beginning yes
[55:38] sir that's what God wanted at the
[55:40] beginning so what did God want God
[55:42] wanted us all to Fellowship as
[55:44] attributes of one great family
[55:46] fellowshipping together that's God's
[55:48] original desire
[55:50] hey guess what the fall of Man had
[55:52] ruined the law but God's been working to
[55:53] bring us back to his original desire
[55:55] what does God want God wants his
[55:58] attributes in fellowship with him in the
[56:01] Earth again amen and that's what he's
[56:03] working through Redemption Redemption
[56:05] means to buy back to bring back to its
[56:07] original this was the original it fell
[56:10] God now is redeeming us back to his
[56:12] original plan to have a family himself
[56:15] in Fellowship upon the Earth
[56:21] and there's a reason I'm going I know
[56:23] this is familiar but there's a reason
[56:24] I'm going into this because so many
[56:27] times amen when we when we think
[56:29] religiously we think God and we put him
[56:32] in another category and we put him far
[56:34] away but God doesn't desire to be there
[56:37] friends God does not want to be far away
[56:40] and in a different category God wants to
[56:43] be with you God wants to be in you God
[56:45] wants to be in fellowship with you
[56:48] he's only there because we put him there
[56:50] not because he desires to be there this
[56:53] is the same God who would seek out a
[56:55] friend in Abraham when Abraham wasn't
[56:57] seeking God God come and found Abraham
[57:00] Abraham couldn't say you know what I
[57:02] want to be God's friend I'm going to go
[57:03] find God and I'm going to worship him he
[57:06] was living down in in in Mesopotamia he
[57:09] was doing whatever the Mesopotamians do
[57:11] but it was God who come and got him
[57:13] because God wanted to fellowship with
[57:14] Abraham
[57:15] because God had a plan
[57:18] and listen how did we find God
[57:21] how did you find God were you you're
[57:23] searching all over for God no God was
[57:25] searching for you
[57:27] because he wants you amen not just to be
[57:30] a church member but he wants you in this
[57:33] age to be his bride
[57:35] he wants something more
[57:39] amen
[57:41] brother says that's the way he was he
[57:44] was in the beginning by himself God
[57:46] dwelt Alone with his thoughts he'll
[57:49] never do that again I love this
[57:52] statement listen to this God dwelt Alone
[57:54] with his thoughts he'll never do that
[57:56] again because his thoughts are being
[57:58] made manifest
[58:00] God was alone with his thoughts but
[58:02] he'll never be in that lonely condition
[58:04] again because he portioned himself out
[58:07] of her time and he's been redeeming
[58:09] those thoughts and bringing them back
[58:10] together and someday we will all sit as
[58:13] a family of God upon the face of this
[58:15] earth and the new heavens and the new
[58:17] Earth having the fellowship that God
[58:18] desires
[58:21] he'll never do that again because
[58:27] today is God fellowshipping with his
[58:31] thoughts
[58:33] what are you a thought of God that's
[58:35] expressed in this hour Amen to be the
[58:38] bride in this day and why because he
[58:40] wants to fellowship with his thoughts
[58:44] so we've got to stop making us I'm a
[58:46] little person down here he's a great God
[58:48] over there no amen by the revelation of
[58:50] the hour amen by the quickening of the
[58:52] word that's in you you realize I came
[58:54] from God and I'm going back to God God
[58:57] thought of me before the foundation of
[58:58] the world Amen I was recorded in the
[59:00] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[59:02] foundation of the world I'm his thought
[59:04] expressed on the earth and what did he
[59:06] want in the beginning he wanted to
[59:07] fellowship with his thoughts if that's
[59:09] what he always wanted what does he want
[59:11] from me now
[59:13] to fellowship with his thoughts
[59:17] amen God did not come in the end time
[59:20] and bring a prophetic Ministry to peel
[59:22] back the mystery of his Bible so that we
[59:24] would stay in religious thinking about
[59:26] God
[59:27] he wanted to draw us back into that
[59:29] Fellowship
[59:32] amen
[59:34] after man fell
[59:36] was separated from God God started
[59:39] expressing himself back to man again
[59:41] amen and he expressed himself as a man
[59:44] and he came as Melchizedek amen the the
[59:47] great priest of God and he was a
[59:49] theophany form but he was in the form of
[59:51] man and he come and he served communion
[59:53] bread and wine to Abraham then when he
[59:56] was dealing with Moses and Moses says
[59:58] let me see your glory he tells Moses I
[1:00:00] can't you can't see me my face or you'll
[1:00:03] die but I'll put you in the cleft of The
[1:00:04] Rock and put my hand and after I passed
[1:00:06] by you can see my back parts and Moses
[1:00:09] saw the back parts of a man
[1:00:11] what is God constantly doing he's coming
[1:00:14] as Melchizedek he and God comes on the
[1:00:16] plains of memory and he takes amen part
[1:00:18] of the earth and he forms a man to step
[1:00:21] into to come and talk to converse with
[1:00:23] Abraham God is wanting to show what his
[1:00:26] desire is is he he made us in His image
[1:00:29] so he keeps coming in form of man
[1:00:31] through the Old Testament so that he can
[1:00:33] have fellowship with his people
[1:00:36] so that we would know him not a far-off
[1:00:39] thing not a distant feeling but a person
[1:00:43] he made personal contact with Abraham he
[1:00:46] made personal contact with Moses he made
[1:00:48] personal contact
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:55] the prophet says in the message
[1:00:57] countdown he says and I believe then and
[1:00:59] there that everything on Earth reflects
[1:01:02] Heaven I believe that because that you
[1:01:04] see everything struggling for life is
[1:01:06] because that there is a life that it's
[1:01:07] reflecting from and I believe that when
[1:01:09] God made man he started reflecting the
[1:01:11] smaller things such as animal life then
[1:01:13] the next thing he created was something
[1:01:15] different that just exactly the way the
[1:01:17] Bible says he didn't he made first the
[1:01:19] trees in the botany life and he made man
[1:01:21] and then the last thing that ever come
[1:01:23] forth on the earth in the form of
[1:01:24] creation was a man
[1:01:26] nothing higher ever come because why it
[1:01:29] was a perfect reflection of the highest
[1:01:31] in heaven which God is a man God's in
[1:01:34] the form of man see God is a man so
[1:01:37] therefore it proves it and then God came
[1:01:39] down to dwell among us he was a man when
[1:01:43] God came to dwell Among Us what form did
[1:01:44] he take he took the form of the man
[1:01:46] Christ Jesus he come in the form of man
[1:01:49] that was God's desire
[1:01:51] so it shows that the Perfection of the
[1:01:54] evolution was God which is a man
[1:01:58] why am I who I am why am I in the shape
[1:02:01] I am because that's where God wants to
[1:02:02] have Fellowship
[1:02:04] this is reflecting god let's turn to
[1:02:06] Second Corinthians chapter four
[1:02:18] second Corinthians chapter 4.
[1:02:21] verse 5.
[1:02:27] for we preach not ourselves but Christ
[1:02:29] Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[1:02:31] servants for Jesus saying for God who
[1:02:33] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:02:35] Darkness has shine in our hearts to give
[1:02:37] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[1:02:39] of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:02:43] I think it was amazing that that God
[1:02:45] told Moses you cannot see my face and
[1:02:48] live but he's going to reveal himself in
[1:02:50] the face of Jesus Christ now you can
[1:02:52] look at Jesus Christ who was what he was
[1:02:54] the image of the invisible God
[1:02:57] he was God in flesh he was the very
[1:02:59] image of the invisible God and God came
[1:03:01] down in flesh to what to redeem his
[1:03:04] children but also to fellowship with
[1:03:06] them so that they would understand God
[1:03:08] not as a far-off something but now God
[1:03:11] is in flesh
[1:03:13] he could be touched he could be seen you
[1:03:15] could hear him talk he could he could
[1:03:16] reach down and write in the sand amen
[1:03:19] now God was making steps closer to man
[1:03:21] because God wanted to be understood by
[1:03:24] man
[1:03:27] why did God send this message
[1:03:30] he didn't send it for confusion
[1:03:32] he sent it to peel away confusion
[1:03:35] and as he peels away confusion he draws
[1:03:38] us closer to himself
[1:03:40] it's the unveiling of God
[1:03:43] where God's unveiling himself to his
[1:03:45] children so that we know him so that we
[1:03:47] can relate to him so that he can relate
[1:03:48] to us he came as a man and now we see
[1:03:51] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:03:53] Christ
[1:03:54] the image of the invisible God
[1:03:57] and you can love him and see him as a
[1:04:00] man and relate to God God didn't want to
[1:04:03] stay far away
[1:04:05] I don't think today he wants to stay far
[1:04:08] away
[1:04:09] let's look at John chapter 1.
[1:04:12] the Gospel of John chapter 1.
[1:04:27] John chapter 1 verse 1.
[1:04:30] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:04:33] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:04:35] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:04:38] let's go over to verse 14 now
[1:04:40] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:04:42] among us and we beheld his glory the
[1:04:44] glory is of the only begotten of the
[1:04:46] father full of grace and truth
[1:04:50] I'd like to say that the word is a
[1:04:52] person
[1:04:53] the word is it's not just print on paper
[1:04:56] amen but the Word was God the word was
[1:04:59] with God the Word was God and then the
[1:05:01] word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:05:03] in the flesh of Jesus Christ so the word
[1:05:05] is a person
[1:05:07] the word is God the prophet tells us
[1:05:09] that Jesus Christ is the word and the
[1:05:11] word is God the word is a person amen
[1:05:13] that's why for me it's not it's not just
[1:05:17] doctrines it's not just teachings it's
[1:05:19] not just print this word is a person
[1:05:21] amen this message that come to peel back
[1:05:24] the Bible didn't come to bring us
[1:05:26] theological understanding and teachings
[1:05:28] and doctrines so that we could have
[1:05:29] teachings and doctrines it's here to
[1:05:31] reveal the person so that it becomes
[1:05:33] more personal
[1:05:35] not less personal more personal
[1:05:38] by revealing his mystery is great plan
[1:05:40] is all of his desires he becomes more
[1:05:43] personal not less personal
[1:05:46] that's why
[1:05:49] you know to me there's there's there's
[1:05:53] there's two schools of thought
[1:05:56] if I could just share it this way
[1:05:58] there's a school that says this is what
[1:06:00] the word says and we must obey the word
[1:06:02] and and and and there's nothing wrong
[1:06:04] with that but it can move to a
[1:06:05] legalistical side
[1:06:07] to where now we know the commandment and
[1:06:09] we must keep the commandment and we're
[1:06:11] keeping the Commandment for the sake of
[1:06:13] keeping Commandments
[1:06:15] but then there's this other side that
[1:06:17] says but God is so loving he's a loving
[1:06:19] God and he loves me and and God accepts
[1:06:22] me and loves me
[1:06:24] right have we seen the two sides and
[1:06:27] then there's a liberal side
[1:06:29] but the truth is always down the middle
[1:06:31] the truth is this commandment is not
[1:06:34] just a commandment to do and don't this
[1:06:36] commandment is a person this is God
[1:06:39] and God does love me he loves me so much
[1:06:42] he shared his thoughts with me so that I
[1:06:44] can express my love to him by taking his
[1:06:46] thoughts and putting them on me and now
[1:06:48] I'm expressing back to him his very
[1:06:50] heart's desire
[1:06:52] it's not about rule keeping it's not
[1:06:54] about theology it's not about liberalism
[1:06:56] well God just loves me and accepts
[1:06:58] everything then you're proving you don't
[1:07:00] love God Amen because this word is him
[1:07:04] he is the word amen the word was with
[1:07:06] him the word was him the word was made
[1:07:08] flesh the word is also a person so when
[1:07:10] we reject the word we also reject God
[1:07:13] claiming that God loves us but I don't
[1:07:15] love his word how can you love him and
[1:07:17] not love his word he is the word the
[1:07:20] word was him the word came out from him
[1:07:22] the word is expressing him how could we
[1:07:24] not how could we reject the word and say
[1:07:26] we love God
[1:07:29] but how could we also hold to the word
[1:07:33] so hard and so critical and so rigid
[1:07:37] and have no emotion and no feeling and
[1:07:39] no love
[1:07:40] for God's people
[1:07:42] for God himself you we could take the
[1:07:45] hard theological cold formal
[1:07:47] understanding of word
[1:07:49] and you've done the same thing you've
[1:07:51] got textbook religion but you missed the
[1:07:55] person
[1:07:56] the very person that this word was
[1:07:58] supposed to bring us in contact with a
[1:08:01] person who loves you a person who can be
[1:08:04] grieved a person who can be pleased
[1:08:08] to me I don't want either
[1:08:11] I just want him
[1:08:13] I want him
[1:08:15] the word is also a person
[1:08:18] Jesus was the Fulfillment of all the New
[1:08:20] Testament all the feasts spoke of him
[1:08:22] all the sacrifices spoke of him all the
[1:08:25] prophets were declaring him everything
[1:08:27] in the Old Testament was declaring
[1:08:28] Christ so that means Jesus Christ amen
[1:08:31] the person was the Fulfillment of the
[1:08:34] word the word is a person
[1:08:36] are we in agreement on that the word is
[1:08:39] a person that's why we love the word
[1:08:41] amen we love the word because it's our
[1:08:43] Lord
[1:08:47] let's look in John 15 together
[1:08:56] foreign
[1:08:59] 15.
[1:09:03] verse 15.
[1:09:08] John 15 15. henceforth I call you not
[1:09:10] servants for the servant knoweth not
[1:09:12] what his Lord doeth but I've called you
[1:09:14] friends for all things that I've heard
[1:09:15] of my father I have made known unto you
[1:09:19] so the question is how did Jesus make
[1:09:22] them his friends they didn't just say
[1:09:24] you're my friend he says what makes you
[1:09:26] my friend is that I've revealed the
[1:09:29] mystery to you
[1:09:30] I took what the father told me and I
[1:09:33] revealed to you the servants don't know
[1:09:34] these things but friends do I have
[1:09:37] revealed this to you making you my
[1:09:39] friends and so if God opens himself up
[1:09:42] and reveals it it makes the relationship
[1:09:44] deeper
[1:09:45] and we live in the day where Christ is
[1:09:47] being unveiled to take the relationship
[1:09:49] from friends now to a wife
[1:09:53] amen now let's look at the next verse
[1:09:55] ye have not chosen me
[1:09:58] but I have chosen you
[1:10:00] amen this wasn't the disciples choice
[1:10:03] this was God's choice
[1:10:05] and I'd like to say if you're if you're
[1:10:08] part of the Bride of Jesus Christ it's
[1:10:09] not your choice
[1:10:11] it's his choice
[1:10:13] and he chose you for a reason and he
[1:10:16] wants to have fellowship with you and I
[1:10:18] he wants to express himself to us and
[1:10:21] express himself through us
[1:10:24] let's look at Matthew 28 together
[1:10:36] Matthew 28 and 19.
[1:10:48] Matthew 28 and 19 go you therefore and
[1:10:50] teach All Nations baptizing them in the
[1:10:52] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:10:54] the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe
[1:10:56] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[1:10:58] you and lo I Am with You alway even to
[1:11:02] the end of the world
[1:11:04] now he's promising that he's going to be
[1:11:06] with them he promised he would be the
[1:11:08] comforter to them he would come to them
[1:11:10] but he says I will be with you I
[1:11:14] personal pronoun the prophet says over
[1:11:16] and over I the person of Jesus Christ he
[1:11:19] will be with you amen this is personal a
[1:11:22] personal God
[1:11:24] brother Graham says the Bible said when
[1:11:26] when he the Holy Ghost has come he will
[1:11:28] testify me he is a person not a thought
[1:11:32] the Holy Ghost is a person not a thought
[1:11:35] a person not a concept a person not an
[1:11:38] emotion it's a person
[1:11:40] it's a person making personal contact
[1:11:42] it's a person coming to fellowship with
[1:11:45] the person it's a person coming to live
[1:11:47] with a person
[1:11:50] this is what God wants this is God's
[1:11:52] desire
[1:11:54] says but where is that Jesus Dr Morris
[1:11:57] Reed had the president of the great
[1:11:58] Sudan missions the greatest in the world
[1:12:00] came to me recently in the room he said
[1:12:02] brother Branham I have enough degrees
[1:12:04] with honorary degrees to plaster your
[1:12:06] wall he said but where is Christ and any
[1:12:08] of it has the teachers been wrong
[1:12:11] I said I would not wish to say that sir
[1:12:13] as a person with a grammar school
[1:12:15] education I could not say that those
[1:12:17] great fine teachers has been wrong but
[1:12:19] they've told you the truth but Christ
[1:12:21] doesn't go by degrees that you get there
[1:12:24] through theology Christ is by faith he's
[1:12:27] not a myth he is a person
[1:12:34] the holy spirit's not a thought
[1:12:37] it's a person
[1:12:38] when he the Holy Ghost has come and he
[1:12:41] is a personal pronoun it's absolute it's
[1:12:43] a it's a person of Christ in the form of
[1:12:46] the Holy Spirit living in you
[1:12:49] not a thought not a concept not an
[1:12:52] emotion amen it's it's it's not even an
[1:12:56] experience although there's an
[1:12:57] experience that goes with it it's a
[1:12:59] person
[1:13:00] it's the person of Christ coming to make
[1:13:03] contact with you as a person it's two
[1:13:06] persons coming together
[1:13:09] we've religion has made this so many
[1:13:12] other things they've made it a certain
[1:13:14] experience they made it a certain
[1:13:15] thought accepting a certain Doctrine but
[1:13:17] when you really get down to the core of
[1:13:19] it it's the person of Jesus Christ
[1:13:21] coming to you as a person and two
[1:13:23] persons coming together
[1:13:25] that's what God wants that's what he
[1:13:28] desires that's what he's restoring
[1:13:33] Jesus said to his disciples in John 14
[1:13:35] 18 he says I will not leave you
[1:13:37] comfortless I will come to you
[1:13:40] who come to you if the comforters come
[1:13:42] to you Jesus Christ has come to you not
[1:13:45] a thought not an emotion not an
[1:13:47] experience not a I'm not saying there's
[1:13:49] not emotion and not experience but what
[1:13:51] what is it what's the point of all of it
[1:13:53] the point of all of it is that he the
[1:13:55] person has come to you
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:58] salvation is not sterile salvation is
[1:14:01] not repeating where salvation is not
[1:14:03] mental agreement amen it's so much more
[1:14:05] than that it's a recognition that God
[1:14:08] wants me and that he the person has come
[1:14:11] to me the person and now we're together
[1:14:14] it must be so much more than sterile it
[1:14:18] must be so much more than religion
[1:14:19] there's got to be a reality where two
[1:14:22] people connect together
[1:14:24] it's a relationship amen it's God's love
[1:14:27] expressed and his love received it's so
[1:14:30] much more than what what the whole
[1:14:32] religious World in humanity has made it
[1:14:34] amen it's the person of Christ
[1:14:36] coming to you as a person
[1:14:40] the thoughts of God being expressed
[1:14:42] coming back together again
[1:14:47] you remember the story that brother Adam
[1:14:50] tells when he's going away on a mission
[1:14:53] trip and as he goes on this trip he says
[1:14:56] wouldn't it be wonderful what a what a
[1:14:57] loving family if I would take my wife
[1:14:59] aside and say listen honey when I'm gone
[1:15:01] overseas and if you look at any other
[1:15:03] man you're a divorced woman when you get
[1:15:05] back in and she says well let me talk to
[1:15:08] you for a minute if you go and make eyes
[1:15:10] at any woman or you do anything like
[1:15:12] that and he said wouldn't that be just
[1:15:14] such a lovely family
[1:15:16] he said the reality of it is even if I
[1:15:19] made a mistake
[1:15:21] I believe she would forgive me for it
[1:15:24] right
[1:15:25] but he said I love her so much I would
[1:15:27] never do it
[1:15:29] said and if I would slip up if something
[1:15:31] happened I make a mistake I would be so
[1:15:33] heartbroken I couldn't wait and feel so
[1:15:35] guilty I couldn't wait for the minute
[1:15:37] that I can go and confess it to her and
[1:15:39] make it right
[1:15:41] my brother said that is our relationship
[1:15:43] with God that's the way that it should
[1:15:46] be amen just as real as it is listen
[1:15:50] amen we we as a husband and wife as
[1:15:53] parents and children and and friends
[1:15:55] together we have personal contact with
[1:15:57] each other and that personal contact
[1:15:59] builds such a relationship and such a
[1:16:01] love that we don't want to disappoint
[1:16:03] one another
[1:16:05] now there's many things that we do in
[1:16:07] life for one another amen not we don't
[1:16:10] do them out of convenience because
[1:16:11] sometimes they're not convenient we
[1:16:13] don't do it for our own pleasure because
[1:16:15] sometimes it's not for our own pleasure
[1:16:16] many times it's the personal
[1:16:18] relationship that causes us to make
[1:16:21] sacrifices for one another
[1:16:23] and it's our love that keeps us Amen in
[1:16:26] unity it's our love that is the bond
[1:16:28] amen we become you know how the prophet
[1:16:30] said that Paul was a prisoner Bound by
[1:16:33] chains of love to Jesus Christ
[1:16:36] not by a law not by rules not by a
[1:16:40] religious code but by his love for the
[1:16:42] person of Jesus Christ
[1:16:45] he was bound until all he wanted to do
[1:16:47] was please him
[1:16:49] and we bind ourselves in a loving
[1:16:52] relationship with a husband and wife
[1:16:53] until we're committed we can have faith
[1:16:55] in one another even if we're separated
[1:16:57] over great distances amen I I traveled
[1:17:00] the world I can be on the opposite side
[1:17:03] of the planet and I have no question
[1:17:05] whatsoever about the faithfulness of my
[1:17:07] wife and she has no question whatsoever
[1:17:09] about my faithfulness and it's not
[1:17:11] because of law it's not because of a
[1:17:13] rule book amen it's because we love one
[1:17:15] another
[1:17:16] because we as two persons have come
[1:17:18] together in a relationship and that
[1:17:20] relational bond is so strong that no
[1:17:22] matter what I wouldn't do anything to
[1:17:24] hurt her and she wouldn't do anything to
[1:17:26] hurt me
[1:17:27] now if a human relationship can do that
[1:17:29] amen why not a relationship with God
[1:17:32] that's why I do not understand people
[1:17:34] living in sin
[1:17:37] I understand making mistakes
[1:17:40] I completely understand making mistakes
[1:17:43] amen we make mistakes all the time I
[1:17:45] disappoint my wife all the time she
[1:17:47] disappoints me we have to make that
[1:17:48] right but how can we say we love God and
[1:17:51] continually live in a situation we know
[1:17:53] is contrary to his will and to his will
[1:17:56] how can we say that oh I love God so
[1:17:59] much but I'm trampling all over his word
[1:18:01] which he is the word the word is also
[1:18:03] the person
[1:18:05] but my love for him should cause me to
[1:18:08] want to please him because I know God
[1:18:10] can be pleased
[1:18:13] sometimes I I feel like religion is
[1:18:17] still Among Us
[1:18:20] I feel like religion is still creeping
[1:18:23] in to where I can trample the
[1:18:26] Commandment of God and come and sing a
[1:18:29] song Amen and I'm looking at the church
[1:18:31] and I'm looking at my brother but I'm
[1:18:33] not realizing I have just stomped on the
[1:18:36] heart of God
[1:18:38] amen but a personal relationship won't
[1:18:41] allow me to do that if I fail him I
[1:18:44] can't wait to make it right and tell him
[1:18:45] I'm sorry
[1:18:47] because to me he's more than a book to
[1:18:50] me he's more than a theology to me he's
[1:18:52] more than the building he's more than
[1:18:54] the Fellowship of the Saints to me he's
[1:18:56] a person and that person is a personal
[1:18:58] God to me
[1:19:02] amen
[1:19:04] we've grown past
[1:19:07] legalism I pray we've grown past Church
[1:19:11] order keeping the conduct I want to grow
[1:19:14] past all of that
[1:19:16] I want to grow back into the place where
[1:19:18] I love him
[1:19:20] the person of the word is who I love
[1:19:24] I love him because he first loved me
[1:19:29] I love him because he gave himself for
[1:19:32] me and showed and demonstrated his love
[1:19:34] for me by redeeming me and then calling
[1:19:36] me to himself and then unveiling himself
[1:19:38] to me and that love relationship is what
[1:19:41] is binding me I want to be bound with
[1:19:43] the same change that Paul was bound by
[1:19:48] that's the relationship I believe God is
[1:19:51] looking for
[1:19:53] a wife who loves you
[1:19:56] not a wife who serves him out of fear of
[1:19:58] hell not not not not a wife who who says
[1:20:02] oh he'll let me get by with anything I
[1:20:04] want no he's looking for a wife that'll
[1:20:07] love him back in the same way he loves
[1:20:10] for a relationship
[1:20:12] because God is a person
[1:20:16] if if that could just get down home to
[1:20:19] us God is a person
[1:20:22] God must be known
[1:20:24] personally
[1:20:26] God must be experienced on a personal
[1:20:29] level
[1:20:32] I don't want to disappoint him
[1:20:36] I want to love him back
[1:20:38] because he first loved me
[1:20:42] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:20:44] the prophet said what is the new birth
[1:20:46] then
[1:20:47] say well brother Brandon what is the new
[1:20:48] birth it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:20:51] Christ personally to you
[1:20:54] a personal contact with a personal God
[1:20:58] now you joined a church you shook hand
[1:21:00] you've done something different you said
[1:21:02] a Creed you promised to live by a code
[1:21:04] of rules but Christ the Bible he is the
[1:21:07] word that was revealed to you and no
[1:21:08] matter what anybody says what takes
[1:21:10] place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever
[1:21:12] it might be it's Christ in you that is
[1:21:15] the Revelation that the church was built
[1:21:18] upon
[1:21:19] with that relationship with that
[1:21:21] Revelation and that relationship listen
[1:21:24] it doesn't matter where you go you'll
[1:21:26] serve God
[1:21:28] it doesn't matter what environment you
[1:21:30] land in you'll serve God it doesn't
[1:21:32] matter if it's at work at school with a
[1:21:35] crowd of unbelievers in the church now
[1:21:37] all of a sudden my conduct is not
[1:21:39] changing with the environment that I'm
[1:21:41] in
[1:21:43] in church I can be one way when I'm with
[1:21:45] the Believers I'm always this way when I
[1:21:47] get with another crowd I change to this
[1:21:48] amen I say the relationship has to go
[1:21:51] deeper than that until you're in such a
[1:21:53] relationship with the person of Jesus
[1:21:55] Christ until wherever you're at you
[1:21:57] don't disappoint him
[1:21:59] and whatever you do you want to please
[1:22:01] him because he's come alive to you in
[1:22:04] this relationship
[1:22:07] and then nobody has to watch us
[1:22:11] we don't need we don't need somebody to
[1:22:15] to go on patrol and make sure we're
[1:22:16] doing all right we don't need deacons to
[1:22:19] come into our house and inspect
[1:22:21] because none of our deacons want to come
[1:22:23] into the house and inspect I guarantee
[1:22:25] it
[1:22:26] we don't need to watch each other we
[1:22:28] don't need to be inspectors we don't
[1:22:30] need to be critical what we need is to
[1:22:33] get people in love with a living God
[1:22:35] Amen we need people who come into a
[1:22:37] relationship with a living Jesus Christ
[1:22:39] to the person of the word himself who
[1:22:42] comes to a person themselves and the two
[1:22:45] unite together as per two persons
[1:22:47] together as one
[1:22:49] once that's happened then you don't have
[1:22:51] to worry about where they go or what
[1:22:54] they see or what they hear because
[1:22:56] there's so there's such a desire within
[1:22:59] us not to disappoint Christ
[1:23:01] not to displease him
[1:23:04] then all of a sudden our attitudes
[1:23:07] change our conducts change our all the
[1:23:10] things in our life begin to change
[1:23:15] let's look at John 17. together John 17
[1:23:18] verse 3. I want to spend a little time
[1:23:21] with this thought here as we wind down
[1:23:23] to a close but this John 17 is the
[1:23:26] thought that I want to leave with you
[1:23:42] John 17 3.
[1:23:47] and this is life eternal that we might
[1:23:51] Know Thee the only true God in Jesus
[1:23:53] Christ whom thou has sent
[1:23:55] I'm going to spend a little bit of time
[1:23:56] on this phrase John 17 3.
[1:23:59] this is life eternal
[1:24:02] so what is eternal life
[1:24:05] to know him
[1:24:08] this is life eternal
[1:24:11] that we might Know Thee the only true
[1:24:13] God in Jesus Christ and thou Ascent what
[1:24:16] is eternal life
[1:24:18] to know him
[1:24:20] to know him
[1:24:22] we can make it a reward at the end of a
[1:24:25] journey we can make it this but really
[1:24:26] this is eternal life
[1:24:29] is to Know Thee
[1:24:31] to know God is eternal life
[1:24:36] in Jehovah Jireh the prophet says in the
[1:24:38] the Christianity is misrepresented to
[1:24:41] the people
[1:24:42] Christianity has been misrepresented to
[1:24:44] the people as a declaration of creed
[1:24:46] Christianity is a living being Jesus
[1:24:50] Christ the resurrected God that's alive
[1:24:52] and Among Us Now Christianity is a
[1:24:55] person not a Creed
[1:24:57] to know him is life not even to know his
[1:25:00] word that isn't life no him and he is
[1:25:03] the word
[1:25:04] sounds like a contradiction that he's
[1:25:06] saying not even to know the word but to
[1:25:08] know him which is the word amen and what
[1:25:11] we're talking about is to know the word
[1:25:14] in an intellectual way is not the same
[1:25:16] as knowing the person of the word
[1:25:19] we can read and study and comb through
[1:25:21] and and read books of Theology and we
[1:25:24] could read Greek and Hebrew and we can
[1:25:26] have a mental understanding of what
[1:25:28] every word in this Bible actually means
[1:25:30] amen and still not know him who is the
[1:25:33] person of the word this word was written
[1:25:35] about a person and a person came and
[1:25:37] fleshed this word
[1:25:40] and we need to know him
[1:25:43] that's why the prophet would be
[1:25:44] criticized that you don't know your
[1:25:45] Bible very well he said well that may be
[1:25:47] true but I know the author
[1:25:49] awfully well
[1:25:51] I tell you what's more important to know
[1:25:53] the Greek phrases and the and to know
[1:25:54] the punctuation are to know the person
[1:25:56] that this book is written about the one
[1:25:58] who wrote it about himself to unveil
[1:26:00] himself to himself so that himself and
[1:26:03] himself can come back together
[1:26:07] amen
[1:26:08] to know him is eternal life
[1:26:11] not to just know about him I'd say the
[1:26:14] world is full of people who know about
[1:26:16] Jesus Christ
[1:26:18] but how many people know him
[1:26:21] how many people know him that's a good
[1:26:23] question
[1:26:25] maybe billions of people know about him
[1:26:28] no information about him know roughly
[1:26:31] when he lived roughly some events that
[1:26:33] happened in his life there's billions of
[1:26:36] people who know about the Bible and they
[1:26:38] know some of the stories but how many
[1:26:40] people know him
[1:26:42] and how many people know the author real
[1:26:44] well
[1:26:46] I want to be one of those amen if
[1:26:48] there's one percent if there's a half a
[1:26:50] percent if there's a ten I don't care
[1:26:51] who it is I want to be one of them that
[1:26:53] know the author real well I want to know
[1:26:56] him amen because that's that's life
[1:26:58] Everlasting that's eternal life is to
[1:27:00] know the person amen not to know the
[1:27:03] theology to know the person
[1:27:05] it's like well well if that's all it
[1:27:07] thinks why do we read the Bible so much
[1:27:09] and why did the message come and why is
[1:27:11] there so much information amen I I don't
[1:27:14] know about you but I never once got
[1:27:16] tired of learning about my wife
[1:27:22] and your brothers if you don't agree
[1:27:23] don't answer out loud
[1:27:26] Just Disagree quietly please
[1:27:29] because Christ in order to draw the
[1:27:32] relationship deeper and deeper there
[1:27:34] must be a greater and greater unveiling
[1:27:37] God wanted to be known he didn't want to
[1:27:40] stay distant and unknown and behind the
[1:27:43] veil there was a veil that veiled us
[1:27:45] Amen to a mystery that he held within
[1:27:47] himself in the back part of his mind
[1:27:49] there was a plan a purpose a desire and
[1:27:52] all of this Bible that he was trying to
[1:27:54] achieve and it was hid behind the veil
[1:27:56] but in order to go to the next step in
[1:27:58] the relationship with his attributes he
[1:28:01] had to take that Veil away so that we
[1:28:03] could know that even the back part of
[1:28:04] his mind because with greater Revelation
[1:28:06] comes a greater relationship
[1:28:09] it's true in humans it's true in God
[1:28:12] it's true all the way around that that
[1:28:14] we talk about this thing and the word
[1:28:16] keeps unveiling and unveiling what's it
[1:28:18] doing it's unveiling to you the person
[1:28:20] you're in love with it's unveiling to
[1:28:22] you more about Christ amen it's it's not
[1:28:25] about passing tests it's about knowing
[1:28:28] him
[1:28:29] and to know him is everlasting life
[1:28:34] I don't think we'll ever get tired of
[1:28:36] finding nuggets in our Bible
[1:28:38] I don't know that well I don't know that
[1:28:40] we'll ever come to the end of it before
[1:28:41] the body change but I I certainly don't
[1:28:44] believe that we will ever grow tired of
[1:28:46] God opening a scripture to us and say ah
[1:28:48] I never saw that before
[1:28:51] it wasn't about gaining a new piece of
[1:28:53] information it was about seeing God all
[1:28:56] over again fresh and it freshens
[1:28:58] something inside of us
[1:29:01] do you think you're the only one who
[1:29:04] enjoys that or do you think maybe God on
[1:29:06] the other side
[1:29:09] we're looking again so many times even
[1:29:12] in receiving Revelation we're standing
[1:29:14] on Earth looking up and we're saying oh
[1:29:17] that was so amazing I just saw that and
[1:29:19] it makes me love God so much more but
[1:29:21] who was it that opened your
[1:29:23] understanding to understand the
[1:29:25] scriptures
[1:29:26] it was the one who wanted you he wanted
[1:29:29] to take your breath away
[1:29:31] he wanted to surprise you he wanted to
[1:29:34] reveal more of himself because he wants
[1:29:37] to draw you into a deeper relationship
[1:29:40] Revelation is not about heading on its
[1:29:42] Revelation is about a deeper
[1:29:44] relationship
[1:29:47] until the bride and Christ become
[1:29:49] inseparable
[1:29:52] by
[1:29:53] invisible chains of love
[1:29:57] to where she'll never deny him or
[1:30:01] disappoint him shall never leave his
[1:30:03] Commandments leave his word she won't do
[1:30:05] what the first church did she won't do
[1:30:07] what every other Church did she won't do
[1:30:09] what Eve did she won't why because he's
[1:30:12] brought a revelation so much and brought
[1:30:14] us into such a love relationship now the
[1:30:16] persons have become one and we wouldn't
[1:30:18] do anything to disappoint him it's his
[1:30:21] grace to us
[1:30:23] the message has come to take us deeper
[1:30:27] the message is deep
[1:30:30] because God is deep
[1:30:32] his love is deep
[1:30:34] you say but I don't understand it you
[1:30:37] don't have to understand it deep you
[1:30:38] just have to know how deep the love of
[1:30:40] God is
[1:30:41] that he will he'll he will open himself
[1:30:43] to the depths of his being
[1:30:46] he will open up mysteries in his mind
[1:30:49] that have never been unveiled before
[1:30:50] things that have laid in the shadow of
[1:30:53] the back part of God's mind he'll open
[1:30:54] up that's how much he loves this bride
[1:30:58] and that's how much he wants to be
[1:31:00] connected to this bride God's love is
[1:31:03] deep
[1:31:04] God is a person
[1:31:09] prophet of God says to know him is life
[1:31:12] the person Christ himself
[1:31:16] not comparing it's a revelation that God
[1:31:19] built his church upon and we don't build
[1:31:21] upon the same that the Bible said Abel
[1:31:24] by faith and faith is a divine
[1:31:25] revelation faith is a divine revelation
[1:31:27] all right this whole thing is built upon
[1:31:29] the Revelation then and unless this is
[1:31:31] revealed to you Jesus said I thank thee
[1:31:34] father that thou has hid these things
[1:31:35] from the wise of this world and revealed
[1:31:37] them to babes such as we'll learn now
[1:31:40] the whole thing is built there you've
[1:31:42] got to know the person
[1:31:45] to know him is life the person
[1:31:49] the message influence he says not to
[1:31:51] know that his book not to know this or
[1:31:53] to know that or know the Creed but to
[1:31:55] know him is life know him as the person
[1:31:58] Christ in you the word made flesh in you
[1:32:00] that's knowing him
[1:32:03] let's go back over that again so what
[1:32:06] does it mean to know him brother Chad is
[1:32:08] it when I've got the doctrines when I
[1:32:09] understand the mystery of the seventh
[1:32:11] seal what does it mean to know him amen
[1:32:13] this is what the prophet said it said
[1:32:16] know him as the person Christ in you the
[1:32:19] word made flesh in you that's knowing
[1:32:22] him
[1:32:23] what does it mean to know him when he is
[1:32:26] revealed to me and in me
[1:32:30] that's knowing him
[1:32:33] and then after if that ever takes place
[1:32:35] I don't think we could ever have I don't
[1:32:38] think we could ever Tire of knowing him
[1:32:43] that's why we'll read through the same
[1:32:45] Bible again and again and again you read
[1:32:49] the same books and the same chapters why
[1:32:51] I just want to know him more I love him
[1:32:54] I love everything I read about him I
[1:32:55] love everything I see about that's why
[1:32:57] we'll pick up the same message books and
[1:32:58] read the same book again and again how
[1:33:01] many times have you read your church H's
[1:33:02] book
[1:33:03] how many times how how often do you go
[1:33:06] through it again and say I love this
[1:33:08] book
[1:33:09] it's not the book it's the person the
[1:33:12] book's about amen
[1:33:14] how many times have you read a scripture
[1:33:16] say I love that it's not the scripture
[1:33:18] it's the person that you're loving
[1:33:21] it's the word oh I just love the word
[1:33:23] you're not loving print on paper you're
[1:33:26] loving the person of that word
[1:33:29] keep loving the person
[1:33:32] grow in love for a person let it be a
[1:33:36] personal love for a personal God because
[1:33:38] God is a person not something far away
[1:33:41] and distant
[1:33:43] he wants to be really close
[1:33:48] that's knowing him
[1:33:50] the word made flesh in you that's
[1:33:52] knowing him when he and you and he
[1:33:54] become one like I said last night in the
[1:33:57] super sign he's got to come to you God
[1:34:00] and man must come one
[1:34:05] I
[1:34:06] I've said this many many times I'll say
[1:34:08] it again
[1:34:10] I don't want religion
[1:34:14] I don't want religious Notions I don't
[1:34:18] want religious ideas I want God
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:23] and if you're like me we're sitting in
[1:34:25] the best place Seekers of God have ever
[1:34:28] set in the history of humanity
[1:34:30] because now for the first time all of
[1:34:34] God in the mystery of God has been
[1:34:36] unveiled
[1:34:38] if you love God there's so much to
[1:34:42] discover about him and the day we live
[1:34:45] and he has unveiled himself so much that
[1:34:49] he's created such an atmosphere for
[1:34:51] closeness
[1:34:53] he's come so close that now he wants to
[1:34:56] be expressed in full measure in a people
[1:34:58] on the Earth in this last day
[1:35:01] he wants you to be his very body the
[1:35:03] body of Jesus Christ
[1:35:06] and he wants to dwell in you not a
[1:35:08] thought not an imagination not a Creed
[1:35:10] not a Doctrine not an idea but a person
[1:35:14] wants to dwell in you and I
[1:35:16] I say God you can have me
[1:35:19] you can have me
[1:35:22] brother Ben said in the message a hidden
[1:35:24] life in Christ
[1:35:26] he said now we're going to speak tonight
[1:35:28] on the holiest of holies the dwelling
[1:35:31] place where God himself dwelt we know in
[1:35:34] the Old Testament Tabernacle when Moses
[1:35:36] was given instructions there was three
[1:35:38] parts this Tabernacle there was an outer
[1:35:40] Court in inner court and then the holy
[1:35:42] of holies and God dwelt in the holiest
[1:35:44] place of all the holy of holies between
[1:35:46] the wings of the cherubim and now the
[1:35:48] prophet is going to relate that to us
[1:35:50] because now we are a Triune being we're
[1:35:53] a body we're a spirit we're a soul
[1:35:56] and now he's saying God wants to dwell
[1:35:58] himself in the holiest of holies
[1:36:01] said them days he dwelt in his
[1:36:03] Tabernacle and today he twelves it he
[1:36:05] dwells in you as his Tabernacle you know
[1:36:07] that you are the Tabernacle of God
[1:36:12] the Temple of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:15] he dwells in you as a tabernacle but we
[1:36:18] must take this place we must make this
[1:36:21] place a dwelling not an outer court or
[1:36:25] the first holy place but we must live
[1:36:27] with God in the holiest of holies a
[1:36:29] consecrated hidden life alone quiet with
[1:36:34] God
[1:36:37] we become too excited upset about too
[1:36:40] many things it shows there's something
[1:36:43] lacking the church ought to be a million
[1:36:45] miles up the road to what it is now
[1:36:47] we're still back down in the Adolescent
[1:36:49] age fussing and fighting and quarreling
[1:36:51] and stewing and we ought to be
[1:36:52] consecrated hid away in the holiest of
[1:36:55] holies with God
[1:36:58] where does God want to dwell today
[1:37:02] what what house will you be build me
[1:37:05] what Tabernacle will you build God
[1:37:07] he wants to dwell in your Tabernacle
[1:37:11] where is the dwelling place of God
[1:37:12] according to the Apostle Paul in the New
[1:37:14] Testament it's in his body his church
[1:37:16] it's in Believers you are the Temple of
[1:37:19] the Holy Ghost you are the Tabernacle of
[1:37:22] God Amen you're the place God wants to
[1:37:24] dwell but now where does he want to
[1:37:26] dwell he wants to dwell in the innermost
[1:37:28] part of you to the core of who you are
[1:37:30] your essence Amen in your soul he wants
[1:37:33] to Quicken the true you to life and
[1:37:35] dwell there
[1:37:37] amen and and the prophet of God says we
[1:37:40] get so upset we're fussing and stirring
[1:37:42] we should be a million miles up the road
[1:37:44] what he means it means we must not have
[1:37:46] come to that place yet
[1:37:48] to where no matter where I go he's with
[1:37:51] me
[1:37:53] it's not
[1:37:54] there's no more foolish Notions of when
[1:37:57] I'm over here I can do this because I'm
[1:38:00] not with the church people
[1:38:02] they're not what what does that have to
[1:38:04] do anything with you and God
[1:38:09] now when I'm over here when I'm on
[1:38:12] vacation
[1:38:13] listen if you're a tabernacle of God
[1:38:16] he's with you on vacation he's with you
[1:38:18] in your bedroom he's with you in the
[1:38:20] middle of the night he's with you on the
[1:38:21] back side of the desert he's with you in
[1:38:23] the high place he's with you in the low
[1:38:25] place he's with you on your best days
[1:38:26] with you on your worst day why he is
[1:38:29] joined unto you the person has come to
[1:38:32] you and you and him are walking together
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:38] I can
[1:38:40] I can transgress the law
[1:38:45] and it not bother my conscience
[1:38:47] unless people find out then I feel
[1:38:49] guilty and they feel bad about me then I
[1:38:51] feel bad because people feel bad about
[1:38:53] me
[1:38:55] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:38:57] if we have a rule a code of conduct and
[1:38:59] rules
[1:39:00] I will keep those rules so that I can
[1:39:03] still look good in your eyes
[1:39:05] because I don't want you to think bad of
[1:39:07] me that's Pride
[1:39:11] and I can reverse the pride and say well
[1:39:13] I just don't want to stumble you
[1:39:20] we can keep rules
[1:39:24] to look good in one another's eyes and
[1:39:26] not to fail in one another's eyes
[1:39:29] we can have a church walk where we all
[1:39:32] walk in a certain level of agreement and
[1:39:34] we all and we should walk together and
[1:39:36] encourage one another and provoke one
[1:39:38] another to love and good works we should
[1:39:39] do that but we need something more than
[1:39:42] that friends
[1:39:44] we need a we need a personal God who's
[1:39:47] with us all the time and we need to
[1:39:48] recognize a personal God who I love so
[1:39:51] much I don't want to do these things to
[1:39:54] him
[1:39:55] it's not that I'm worried about what
[1:39:57] what what you think when you find out or
[1:39:59] what my wife finds out or what my
[1:40:01] friends find out
[1:40:03] I want to serve God in such a way that
[1:40:06] he always knows anyways
[1:40:09] I want the relationship to grow so deep
[1:40:11] that I don't want to disappoint him
[1:40:15] that I don't want to fail him and that I
[1:40:18] always want to do what's pleasing to him
[1:40:23] I know that you're the same way I am
[1:40:26] that God is a personal God and I want
[1:40:30] him to be a personal God
[1:40:32] but I want to be personal back to him
[1:40:37] I want to talk to him I want to worship
[1:40:39] him I want to tell him I love him I want
[1:40:41] to have an intimate relationship with
[1:40:43] the Living God not a sterile
[1:40:45] relationship that's sterile and
[1:40:47] categorized and I pray in the morning of
[1:40:50] prayer I pray in the evening and I come
[1:40:51] to no I want that relationship to grow
[1:40:54] all the time
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] if you're like me you find yourself
[1:40:58] talking to him all the time
[1:41:00] talking to him when you're driving
[1:41:01] talking to him I I find and when I
[1:41:03] really started meditating on this God is
[1:41:06] drawing us so close to him amen I
[1:41:08] literally fall asleep talking to God and
[1:41:11] I wake up talking to him in the morning
[1:41:13] man that's what God is drawing us into
[1:41:15] with this word we have in this day he
[1:41:18] wants to be real he wants to be a real
[1:41:20] person to us and we want to be a real
[1:41:23] person back to him
[1:41:25] I don't want to put him in a box of God
[1:41:28] there's God
[1:41:29] here's a box of word I want that God
[1:41:32] that word that Christ to be a person and
[1:41:35] I want to have my arms wrapped around
[1:41:37] him and embrace and I want to tell him I
[1:41:39] love him and I want to serve him and I
[1:41:41] want to please him every moment of every
[1:41:44] day of my life
[1:41:47] where the devil doesn't want you to have
[1:41:49] a personal relationship with a personal
[1:41:50] God
[1:41:52] he wants us to have religion
[1:41:54] because we can trample on religion
[1:41:57] and then maybe we're sorry you can't
[1:41:59] trample on God
[1:42:01] when you come into a personal
[1:42:03] relationship with him we love him we
[1:42:06] surrender to him we yield to him
[1:42:10] amen let's all stand
[1:42:13] I pray that God takes my heart
[1:42:16] and plants it into yours
[1:42:19] amen
[1:42:21] not to know him is life not to know
[1:42:24] about him I should say his life but to
[1:42:27] know him his life musicians if you could
[1:42:29] come and Blake if you can make your way
[1:42:31] up let's bow our heads and pray
[1:42:34] your heavenly father we thank you Lord
[1:42:36] Jesus for your word
[1:42:39] God the hour that we live in
[1:42:42] you have opened up a channel like has
[1:42:44] never been opened before
[1:42:46] God you're drawing us Lord closer to
[1:42:49] yourself and a closer walk
[1:42:51] than ever before
[1:42:53] I pray God that you'd help us to heed
[1:42:56] that
[1:42:57] to benefit from it Lord to recognize Who
[1:42:59] You Are
[1:43:01] what hour we live in and what you're
[1:43:03] accomplishing
[1:43:05] God I pray you forgive me Lord
[1:43:07] for my failures forgive me for my the
[1:43:11] things that I do that grieve You at Your
[1:43:12] Heart Lord I don't want to do it anymore
[1:43:15] God my desire is to be pleasing to you I
[1:43:18] pray you look at my heart and see
[1:43:20] that my desire Lord is to please you
[1:43:23] to love you to serve you
[1:43:25] to give my body over to you that you
[1:43:28] might finish your work through this
[1:43:29] vessel
[1:43:30] God I thank you that you've made
[1:43:33] yourself so real in this day that we
[1:43:35] live that you've opened yourself Lord
[1:43:37] and unveiled yourself
[1:43:39] and draw on us
[1:43:41] God if there's any here young person old
[1:43:43] person anybody Lord
[1:43:45] that has stayed sterile
[1:43:48] that have categorized you
[1:43:51] made a religion
[1:43:53] I pray that this morning Lord that you
[1:43:55] would help them break beyond that Veil
[1:43:59] God I pray that they would go beyond
[1:44:02] you as a god
[1:44:05] it would go beyond you as Jesus Christ
[1:44:07] the historical figure
[1:44:10] but they would go Lord into the depths
[1:44:12] of the reality of who you really are
[1:44:14] a person
[1:44:16] that loves them
[1:44:18] that wants them
[1:44:20] that wants to fellowship with them
[1:44:22] Lord I pray that you'd open the channels
[1:44:24] of our heart greater than they've ever
[1:44:25] ever been opened before
[1:44:28] may we receive more of you than we've
[1:44:30] ever received before
[1:44:32] may you find a Dwelling Place a
[1:44:34] habitation in our soul
