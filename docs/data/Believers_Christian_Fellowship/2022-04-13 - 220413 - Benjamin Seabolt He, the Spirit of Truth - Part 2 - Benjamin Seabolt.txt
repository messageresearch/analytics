our god lord and as we've sang the songs of zion and we have lifted up our hands to you lord may we at this point in time just completely open our hearts to you lord father and we're just so grateful for this opportunity that you have provided to us to once again come and together around you lord jesus the revealed word for our age lord and we're so grateful that we can stand here as a chosen people when we can sing a song to praise our god lord that you have given us i salve to see in what form that you have came in in our day in our age and we don't stand here worshiping a god of our a figment of our imagination or some feeling or something that we would project to be a god but you have given us eyes to see your word lord and a revelation to know that you are your word and you are the spirit of the truth and that is our god and that is who we come to worship here this evening that is who we come to bow ourselves down before this evening because we are wrong lord but you are right and we want to worship you and give you the proper place father we would just ask now that you would come lord and that you would do what only you can do lord and that you would take the book and that you would loose the seals father and that you would take the bread and that you would break and that you would feed your children lord for no man is capable or even worthy to do this father but you are lord and we would just ask that you would come and do that that you would have the preeminence lord and that you would accomplish what you have supernaturally and uh predestinated this service to accomplish in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you this evening if you'll take your bibles we're going to go to john chapter 14. i'm sorry john chapter 16 john chapter 16 to bring you greetings from our pastor he sent me a message today that all is well on that side of the world that they had arrived safely had their first service everything had went really well so we're thankful for that and we'll just continue to remember them in prayer i'd just like to take a moment to say i appreciate our pastor and i believe he's a great man of god he continues has been and continues to be a great inspiration and a blessing to me and i have to take advantage of the times that he's not here to say those kind of things because if he's here he starts getting red in the face and starts looking down at the floor and maybe kicking his feet around a little bit and i know i'm getting in deep water it's kind of like when he holds up the sign and just says be quiet and start preaching so we have to take advantage of those opportunities but i do have a quote for it and brother branham said i would rather give a man a rose on this side than give him a whole wreath when he when he's gone so i don't i don't think he wants to argue with me about that when i i have quotes on my side so but i know you all feel the same way and we just appreciate him and we miss him when he's gone and uh we only have two services left till he's back just in case anybody's counting but uh we just pray that god would be with him and accomplish what what has been ordained to accomplish there let's uh pick up here in verse 12 chapter 16 verse 12. and i just want to continue with this thought that we had been speaking of the last time on he the spirit of truth and i didn't get very far last time and that's you're all's fault you all are to blame for that but that's okay we'll just keep plucking along and see how far we get this time but in verse 12 chapter 16 of john it says i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you god bless you as you would have your seats and if you'll just give me the benefit to recap just a little bit here this is an extremely important portion of scripture as we would approach this topic because this portion of scripture emphatically declares to us that the spirit of truth is he and he is a personal pronoun reference to a person so it's a declaration that this spirit of truth is not the spirit of some man-made idea or some denomination or some object somewhere but the spirit of truth is a spirit of a living person um so that is if you would want to say a foundation piece for this topic because we know the spirit of truth as we studied last time the spirit of truth is the holy spirit it is the holy ghost it is the token it is the new birth so there is a lot of terminology that you can put to this one topic but at the end of the day we never want to deviate from the revelation that this is a person and this person is none other than the person of god himself so when you receive the new birth when you receive the holy ghost when you receive the spirit of truth we are receiving the spirit of god himself i don't think we fully grasp and understand that i'm not saying that i i'm not declaring that i do but brother brennan made a comment he said one of these days you're going to find out god is in you one of these days you're going to find out that god is in you that's very very significant first john 5 says this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that bear beareth witness because the spirit is truth so now we would go to another very foundational statement here to not try to separate the spirit and the truth and i should have gave you my disclaimer from the beginning if you hear some things that our pastor has been teaching on or that's already been said i apologize for that but it is what it is and i would like to think that as i would mature as a minister that i would start getting comfortable with the fact that people were going to preach things that i've already been looking at and people are already going to say things that i've been looking at and i'm going to say things that people are already preached so it is what it is but again i have word for that because jesus himself came along and he said verily verily so he said it and then he said it again so i think jesus is still in the business of saying verily verily now he may say it on a sunday and then again on a wednesday he may not say it back to back but i still believe he's in the business of saying verily verily but we never want to deviate away from this revelation that the spirit and the truth are the self same being they are the same thing and you will not get the spirit i'll say this you will not get the true spirit without the without the truth without the word brother brandon says that that word has to come first that word has to come in first that word has to already be there in order for it to be quickened so first john 5 6 and 7 gives us that revelation there continuing in verse 7 it says for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one first john 4 6 says we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us but he that is not of god heareth not us hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error so if you hear the true word of god there is only one spirit that will declare that to you anything else is in error ephesians 5 verse 8 says for ye were sometimes in darkness but now you are in light in the lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth and again i'm just recapping these scriptures because i want to make sure that that is very fresh in your mind that this spirit that we are after that we are seeking this spirit of god is the spirit of truth so if we want the spirit of god we have to seek and die to our own selves and seek the spirit of truth that is what we're after if we receive the spirit of truth we've got what we're after but we're not going to get what we're after without getting the truth and recognizing the truth john 14 17 says even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i again person i don't think that we can overemphasize that because the denominational world has made the holy spirit everything else but the person i would say that is one of them one of the basic and most important things that was loosed under the preaching of the seals and under the revelation of the seals and the losing of the book that he the spirit of truth is the person the holy ghost is a person the holy spirit is a person the evidence of receiving the holy spirit is receiving the person because you then act like that person you don't act like a denominational idea you don't act like anything else you will act like the person of christ i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you john 15 26 says but when the comforter is come whom i will send you unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from from the father he shall testify of me and ye shall also bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning so now again we have another terminology come into this we have the spirit of truth we have the holy spirit we have the token we have the new birth but now jesus is saying when the comforter comes and this is i would say a lot of where my inspiration for this is coming because i'm going to use thousands and thousands of words to talk on this topic and teach on this topic but really my inspiration and really where i'm wanting to get to is addressing the problem of knowing what we're seeking for knowing what we're seeking for when we talk and we speak about the holy spirit that's really what i want to address is the uncertainty of what am i seeking for what am i after what do i need because if we don't know what we're seeking for we're not going to recognize what we've got if we receive it and furthermore we can receive something i believe we can genuinely receive something and still not have the comforter of knowing what we've received and that's the spirit that i want to expose that i want to deal with if we want to you know get all pentecostal we can say that we want to jump on his head and give him a black eye and whatever but i just want to expose that and i want to settle that because what comes with that spirit is what brother branham says is a plague on the age and the plague on the age is a nervous tension so with that spirit of uncertainty there comes the plague of the age the nervous tension because you don't know where you stand with god because you don't know what you're seeking or you don't know what you've got but if we are able to answer the question of what he is what it is that i'm seeking what is the holy spirit what is the token what is the new birth what is the comforter if we're able to properly identify that and know that for certainty that's going to alleviate that nervous tension maybe not in your spirit realm not in your flesh realm but in the innermost being you're going to know that you know that you know and that's just a spirit that i'm not very fond of when i see people that are unsettled when i see people that are uncertain that bothers me i do not like that um and i don't like it in myself and i'm not saying that i fully arrived yet so i just want to address that spirit because when we're standing in uncertainty we have no power and again i'm not preaching this as power to you know go out and do great mighty miracles and manifestations and you know things that maybe would be visible i believe those things will be there i believe those things are there i believe in all of those things you all know me well enough to know that but i'm talking about the power to stand the power to stand when everybody and everything else falls away i'm talking about the power of certainty to know that i have met god and i have met his requirements the power that job had the even when your friends come your closest friends your religious friends come and try to talk to you in a different way or to shed a different light the power to know that you know so again there's lots of things that we're going to say here but that's really the inspiration that i want to address here is we don't want to be going from pillar to post we don't want to be swayed we want to be solid we want to be stable and we want to be steadfast and we want to know who we are we want to know that we have met the requirements and in order to meet that requirement we obviously have to know what that requirement is but when we do when we do that i am thoroughly convinced and i have had the experience just like many of you uh can testify as well when we arrive at that point john 15 and 26 comes into effect because we have the comforter we have the comforter and again this is a situation to where you can fool your neighbor you can fool the person sitting beside of you you can fool your pastor you can fool your mom you can fool your dad you can fool everybody else but you know the man inside of the man inside of the man whether he's right or not and i'm not interested in fooling people i'm not interested in you fooling people i'm not interested in those types of things but i'm interested in myself and as a body the inside man the innermost being knowing i'm right with god that i'm standing with a clear conscience that my heart is pure i have met the requirements and i have the comforter with me verse 27 and it says ye also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning we are not going to be able to bear the proper witness witness is testimony manifestation we are not going to be able to bear that and reflect that and project that if we do not have this proper understanding so the point of the comforter of coming is that we can then display something just as uh you know brother chad was preaching the last couple of services the purpose for that light to have come so that it can continue its manifestation so we want to fulfill our portion in the scripture here but we're not going to be able to do that without a proper understanding ephesians 1 verse 12 says that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth in whom ye also trusted after ye heard the word of truth so if you're trusting in something before you've heard the word of truth that's probably your own idea but when you have heard the word of truth from he who god has sent and you have trusted in that now you have access to the comforter continuing it says in whom you also trusted trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit so this is a ceiling that comes after you have heard the truth the only way to hear that truth is through he is through he whom god hath sent not somebody else which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and future home brother branham says then jesus said in john 14 when he the holy ghost is come he will bring these things to your memory he will show you what day you're living in so look at the attributes that's starting to come forth now from the holy spirit from the token from the comforter from the spirit of truth it's going to show you what day you're living in it's going to it's going to reveal to you your proper positional placing spiritually this is an evidence this is a manifestation this is a work of the holy spirit we can make it a lot of things the world in the denominational world has made it a lot of things but this is this is what i want to do i want to bring it back to a scriptural standpoint i want to bring it back to what the prophet taught us because if we don't stick with what he taught us and what this what he expounded from the scriptures we're going to make he the spirit of truth something that he the spirit of truth is not and we're going to make his manifestation something that they are not and then another thing you'll know him he will show you things to come see right back to the prophetic again when he's come john 6 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing nothing the words that i speak to you they are spirit and they are life again we cannot separate the two john 6 28 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on whom he hath sent again that's what i would term a baseline evidence for all believers there may be many many many and no doubt there is vast manifestations of the working of the holy spirit but the the baseline evidence of the indwelling person of christ as you will believe on he whom he hath sent that is one manifestation that every believer every true believer will never deviate away from and must have john 8 42 says jesus said unto them if god were your father you would have loved me for i proceedeth forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth you believe me not so jesus himself is coming along and he is tying these things together the reason that you can hear my words and receive my spirit is because the father we in another portion of scripture says because you have already been taught of the father so it because you have the element of the word laying in you it gives you the capability to hear the truth to hear my word and again as we you you know said probably a thousand times last time i don't think we can over emphasize that we cannot overemphasize the fact that we have a capability to hear and respond and yield to the true word of god there is only one class of people that has that capability the devil can run you around the bushel and everything else and all your mistakes and failures and faults but that is one thing that he can never trump the capability to hear and receive and yield to the true word of god for your age is only given to one class of people her name is mrs jesus christ we take that for granted saints we take that for granted i know i do i know i do because it's so common to us and it should be common to us because brother branham says a true believer his faith to him is just common faith it's just everyday living so we operate in that word in that realm and we should operate in that realm brother bran says real faith he says your unconscious to it it's just there but i think every once in a while we should take some time and recognize and give thanks for having the capability to hear the voice that god has sent us a voice we we are blessed just to have him sent us a voice we are blessed just to physically and carnally have that voice strike our eardrums but to be a class of people that that can now go from our ear to our heart and then have a result that we set aside our mindset and our wants and our desires and our thinking and yield to that with saints without that without that capability we're lost without that capability to hear and yield to that voice we are cannon fodder in the best case scenario we should never never take that for granted and i just want to testify tonight that i'm thankful for that i am thankful number one that he sent me a voice i'm so grateful for that but i am so grateful that he gave me something on the inside of the inside to be able to respond to that voice to be able to recognize that as truth i'm going to skip just a little bit here brother branham says and ashamed he says when a man ever meets god not in some emotional work up some enthusiasm or some religious doctrine some catechism or creed or a dog dogma that he has accepted for a comfort for himself but when he really comes to the place like moses did on the backside of the desert to walk up to face to face with almighty god and you see the voice speaking to you remember he's talking about looking god face to face when you see the voice speaking to you exactly with the word and the promise of the hour it does something to you see you're not ashamed of it it does something to you and remember you might need a spirit that would act like god you might meet a spirit that would do this that or the other follow it a little bit and see how it compares with the word of god you might meet a spirit that would tell you you are saved and give you a glorious feeling and you would shout and scream and then when it comes to denying the word how can the holy spirit that wrote the word deny his own word that spirit must punctuate every promise of god within a man if it isn't then you never met god you met a deceiving spirit and the world is full of it today so again we're coming to that razor's edge that he talked about we're coming to where a person or people would be interacting with a spirit acting like god acting like god remember god is the word so if this if this is a spirit acting like god and it's a shrewd spirit and a deceiving spirit what do you think it's going to be riding on when it comes your way it's going to be riding on a white horse a slight deviation but it's going to be packing a lot of word but it has to be a deceiving spirit acting like god because what you're seeking is god so it wants to give you what you're seeking without you really getting what you're seeking so the only way that it can do that is to do exactly what it did to eve eve's desire was not ungodly seeking god is not ungodly eve's desire to re multiply and reproduce was not ungodly her motherly desire was not ungodly but remember what her desire was it was to be a mother so satan did not come to her telling her how to sew better how to cook better how to till the garden better what did he come riding to her on her desire with a slight deviation a deceiving spirit acting like god did he not do exactly that to the point that he told her if you will partake of this word that i'm offering to you you will become as god is this not the exact thing that the holy spirit does to us when we receive god we become part of god so we see the pattern in the beginning don't think that we get down here to the end of the time and all of a sudden here we come with a godly desire of seeking the holy spirit and satan's going to come to us with something out in left field no he's going to come to us with a spirit acting like god riding on a slight deviation of the word you say that's pretty scary i would agree it's pretty scary but this saints is exactly why the seals had to be loosed remember there was a lot of information under the seals but there were spiritual principles that were loosed under the seals that were taught under the seals and that was what we were after so brother branham can come along and in five seconds revealed that the white horse rider is satan he re he reveals the symbols of the book in five seconds or less but he says we can take this topic and we can preach months and months and months on it and never touch it why because he knows the spiritual principle that's being loosed so the loosing of the seals is not just necessarily to understand the interpretation of the symbols although it is remember there's seals on the book and there's seals on the backs in the book and seals on the back side of the book but the reason this is so important to us is because brother branham comes and he says now we have the devil's answer this is after the seals he says now we have the devil's answer how do we have the devil's answer because the seals revealed the devil's tactics i can't say this the way that i'm wanting to say this i just i hope that you can understand because the seals revealed satan's tactics we can then garner the truth from it because if we know this that the devil's tactics and what he's to do we can combat that by not taking that route so by default if we know what the enemy is going to do and we do opposite of that we get the right thing so even if the seals when they were preached and when they were broken even if the seals did nothing but reveal what the devil's tactics were and i may be wrong but i'm of the opinion that was the main thrust of them even if they did nothing but that by default it would reveal to us what we needed to do and remember when we look at the seals and even if you look at the symbols within the book the symbols within the book are speaking of satan because it's talking about a white horse going forth so even the symbols within the book are talking about satan it's not talking necessarily about seeing christ you understand what i'm saying it's a it's a white horse that goes forth and that's satan and then it's a red horse and that's satan and then a black horse and that satan and a pell horse that said it's talking a lot about the enemy the symbols themselves and if you go back and study the seals you will you will notice that even in the preaching of the seals he is dwelling primarily on the enemy but what is he doing he's revealing the enemy and that is why the seals had to be loosed because the enemy had to be exposed in order for us to know how to combat that because in the last days perilous times shall come and there will be wolves and sheep closing on a white horse with a slight deviation of the message and they'll fight for that and they'll cause spiritual famine and they will cause death reading quotes and speaking what the prophet spoke and that would be a problem and that is a problem but i'll give you a greater problem is when we read the same quotes in the same scriptures and we take our own understanding and we don't even let a wolf in sheep clothing give us that but we want to cling to our own ideas and not bring it subject to the voice and whom he hath sent because when that is happening it is not going to be something totally out in the left field most of the time it is not going to be something way off what it's going to be is it's going to be a slight deviation of the world word it's going to be a deceiving spirit acting like god that's still giving you what you really want in your carnal nature that's the deception that's why the seals had to be loosed is so that we can recognize that white horse when it comes we have to recognize the white horse or one big trouble but now that the seals have been loosed there is a people in the face of the earth that can recognize that slight deviation quickly we don't have to end up at the end of the pattern before we realize there's a problem i would venture to say that we're coming to the point in time as maturity is developing within the bride i believe that we are fighting the white horse more and more and more and this is a good thing because if we're fighting the white horse that means we're still in the front front lines and he hasn't breached we're not on the red horse we're not on the black horse thank god we can't end up on the pale horse by his predestination but just because you're dealing with the white horse on a daily basis does not make you a bad person i would venture to say it makes you a good person because at least you're not on the red horse or on the black horse so you're going to be fighting a battle that's not the issue the issue is when you let the white horse in when you let that deceiving spirit acting like god deceive you away from the true word from he whom he hath sent so now that we recognize how this spirit is to come we have the ability to combat it without the seals being loosed remember we we have thousands of years of church history thousands of years of church history of how they fell and why they fell but now that we have that loosed we don't have to repeat that that's the only difference between us and the other church ages saints but brother branham we know this scripturally this had to be done at the end time because there had to be a people in the face of the earth that would not take his bait that would not fail and the only way for us not to fail is to know his tactics he says you met a deceiving spirit and the world is full of it today thank god we have a word to recognize a deceiving spirit continuing further down in this quote he says now that quickening power that came upon jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day if it's not a mockery holy spirit and again as i expounded upon this last time this is so profound to me the terminology that he would come and he would use describing this enemy and describing this tactic of a mockery holy spirit something that is impersonating a spirit so well that it would even take the same title of the holy spirit but it would be a mockery holy spirit again this is this is a honed razor's edge and this is the battle that we fight within ourselves between our soul and our spirit realm and the only way that we're going to overcome that is to allow the word to discern between the soul and the spirit to believe on whom he hath sent and allow he whom he has spent sent to discern between our soul and our spirit and that takes something as as the old saying is to just being honest with ourself because again this is this we're living in in a day and an age that we have the capability to deceive and to fool those that are around us we just have to acknowledge that we have to accept that it is what it is but that's not my concern my concern and brother branham said all hell is against the revelation to the individual it's not about you understand what i'm saying here it's not i'm not doing away with the local church body but it's not about the local church body and what it's projecting or even what your neighbor is projecting it is about knowing beyond a shadow of doubt on your soul where you're at and being honest with yourself allowing he the spirit of truth to come and discern your life because if not we're going to end up with a mockery holy spirit something that's taking most probably most of the word but still disregarding part of it he says but is the if it's the real true holy spirit it will manifest the promise of this hour the promise of this hour is a full manifestation of the word i'll just make that real simple don't get confused in what the promise of the hour is the promise of the hour is a full manifestation in bright form the promise of the hour is a full manifestation of the unadulterated word of god without your interpretation or without your deviation being manifested through your being brother branham gave all types of terms to this age he called it a bride age an astronaut age but i think he called it an abrahamic age but i think my favorite description was he come and he says this is a free age this is a free age we are free to live a life and a manifestation without compromise we have the capability and the power to do that because satan's tactics have been exposed and we have had a true word and a wave sheath set before us we do not have to compromise and settle for a mockery holy spirit or a partial manifestation of the word okay that's where we ended up last time so this is all new stuff now i know you're excited 1965 god's power to transform we just listened to this but brother branham says speaking of cain he says remember he thought of god he worshipped god he had a church he built an altar he made a sacrifice he prayed he worshiped were any of those bad were any of those different than what we do not a bit but he was rejected religion see that is satan's business so now couple this with the quotes that we just read of a mockery holy spirit and a deceiving spirit acting like god now he comes at the very end of his ministry and he says that religion which could be defined as a mockery holy spirit a false comforter that's what religion is he says that is satan's business that was his business in the beginning that is his business now brother brandon says it's not the people out there in the bar rooms and on the street and out there in the world that's going to be disappointed on that day he says it's going to be the people who thought they were right satan's business is religion giving you a false comforter that's his business that's what he wants to do to you each and every day he says not to kill the whole thing not to destroy the whole message he's not going to set himself up for failure he knows he can't do that he can't kill the whole thing but what he can do is make it his business to pervert it and to pervert it on the individual level that's his business not to kill the whole thing he says all no not communist no no the antichrist is not communism the bible said it would deceive the very elected if it was possible don't notice the iron curtain but the purple one meaning the religious one notice cain came to worship but he had the wrong seed in him serpent seed the hiss of the serpent had hissed over him for he was the seed of the woman he watched this carefully he knew the perfect will of god but he refused to do it you say that bad bad bad person that's the battle we face each and every day god has sent us a voice to reveal the remember his will is his word and has revealed the perfect word and the perfect will of god to us if we deviate away from that we've done the same thing cain has done so we can make it as far off as we want it to be but it's really not and like i said before i'm not interested in far off i'm interested in right here because this flesh is still hybrid just like yours is it still has serpent seed mixed in with it understand so we're going to fight the same thing that that cain fought the spirit that that cain was dealing with is the same spirit we have to fight and what was that the true word of god came to him and he refused it now thank god we're elect we're predestinated that we will eventually get it right and i believe that with all my heart i believe we are predestinated to get it right the bride of jesus christ is predestinated and quite frankly as brother branham said later in this message that's the only that's the only reason we're going to get it right because if we were left in the condition that we were that we're in we're going to get it wrong that's the whole point of him sending us a voice to free us from that he said he knew the perfect will of god but he refused to do it that is the battle saints that is the battle did you know that satan knows the will of god but just refuses to do it so again we come to these parallel tracks and we come to these contrasts so if a spirit acting like god that isn't god and a mockery holy spirit and a religious spirit knows the true word of god but fails and refuses to do it and we're not wanting a mockery holy spirit or a deceiving spirit or a religious spirit we're wanting the true person of the holy spirit what should we then do to get it elementary i know but that's really how simple it is receive the true word of god which is his will and don't refuse it yield to it the key to all of this is die to yourself the key to all of this we like i said we can use thousands and tens of thousands of words and no doubt we'll continue to do that but really at the end of the day it's that simple to die to ourself let the word from he whom he hath sent expose the fallacies in our life and die to that by default you will receive the spirit of truth but you must die to yourself because that is what cain failed to do that is what satan failed to do even in heaven remember that's where the battle started that's what satan failed to do he refused to die to himself cain just manifested that in a fleshly form that spirit has continued to manifest itself all the way down through time until we come to the last age at the very closing moments of time and now there's a people in the face of the earth who has heard the true will and word of god and refuses to compromise on that but dies to themself and allows a free age to be manifested through themselves a free age the word is free to manifest itself so this mockery holy spirit that brother branham is speaking about remember this may not be something written down as a creed in a denominational church somewhere or even in a message church somewhere let's not be so naive to think that there aren't message churches who have an unwritten creed like this is what we believe and if you don't like it there's the door we understand there's i mean there's been decades of doctrines and ministries and people and followings um you know we're not children anymore let's just call it for what it is there there have there have been deviations away from the message i hope that's not shocking to anybody but we understand that when brother branham is talking about this mockery holy spirit this may not be a written creed in in against the written word of god somewhere this may simply be a spirit that somebody has received and is projecting that you have received and are projecting and that that can be your creed a creed is something that you're living by it can be your own creed you may be a one-man denomination that's why we have to have the voice because only the voice can come and expose those things and the greatest battle ever fought brother random says now what did satan do satan had the others anointing now satan anoints his servants what does he anoint them with with unbelief satan and his demons anoints humanity to disbelieve god's word i don't think that needs expounded opponent now if you want to confirm that you turn to genesis 3 4. that's the first thing he did he never leaves his same tactic he does it all the time again this is why the seals had to be loosed because now that we know his tactics we know he's not going to change that we know how to combat him we now we know how to overcome him he says he does it all the time now he didn't disagree with the word he's exposing the tactic now catch it he didn't disagree with the word he just caused her to kind of misconstrue it a little bit you know just kind of make it sound like the way he wanted it to sound don't take the whole word this is the mockery holy spirit this is a spirit acting like god that's trying to deceive the individual and he's doing it brother branham said all of the time back then and now the deception here brother brandon says the deception is to make people believe they're saved when they're not now i want to pre-qualify the terminology of saved when i'm speaking of saved i'm speaking of that from the revelation that we have of what saved means we know we were saved before the foundation of the world but in the christian world uh there is that term being saved when i'm speaking of saved i'm speaking of the new birth you dying and the word having the effect total effect receiving he the spirit of truth um the token the comforter so when i'm saying saved i'm not saying that in a generic form of yes i recognize jesus christ was the son of god he died on a cross and bled and died for me hallelujah i'm saved that's not what i'm referring to what i'm referring to is being saved truly recognizing that that was the word that bled and died for me and if i don't accept the word for my age i'm not accepting that word but because i accept this word for my age i also accept that word that died on the cross for me you can't have one without the other so if we receive the true word for our age we've died to ourself when we have allowed the true word for our age to come into our being we are saved we have been saved and we are currently saved and we're going to be saved in the future we have the token we have the new birth so that's what i'm referring to when i say saved but brother branham says the deception is for satan to come and to make you feel that you are saved when you're not he says that is the deception of this age and remember that is going to come through the religious ranks because that is where satan does his business at so satan is going to come into the religious ranks he is going to come into what we would say the ranks of the message and he is going to preach a gospel he is going to preach a message with a slight deviation that will still make you believe that you are saved and he is trying to comfort you with that satan's deception is to make you believe that you are saved when you're not the only other tactic that he has the only other tactic that he has is if you really are saved to make you believe you're not that's his two tactics he is going to convince you that you are saved when you're really not or if you really are he's going to try to convince you you're not because he knows if you have that proper understanding and you have the indwelling comforter he is powerless before you because the scripture says if my heart does not condemn me nothing can stand in my way so because religious is his business that's the only thing that he has i got to convince you you're saved before you really do get saved but if by for chance you do get saved before i convince you you're not saved i have to make you believe that you're not saved when you really are saved that is his business and that is what takes the comforter away from us that is why the seals had to be loosed that is why we had to have a vindicated prophet come and tell us what is right and what is wrong and that is why we have to die to any of our own thinking and strictly legalistically militantly take what he said is truth because anything else is going to leave us running around the cow shed anything else is going to bring us down from our proper position anything else is going to bring condemnation into our heart remember religion is satan's business you're not going to beat him at it you are not going to beat satan at religion it is his business and he has spent thousands and thousands and thousands of years just in this dimension mastering it let alone what he did in the other dimension you are not going to beat him with your mental prowess we have one chance saints we have one hope and that is to take what the voice said to us and if he said that the evidence of receiving god in your being is to believe on him who he hath sent and yield completely to that word that is the one and only evidence and you have done that do not allow satan to talk you out of it amen do not allow him to talk you out of what you have received and furthermore be honest with yourself you're not going to gain anything by fooling me or your brother and sister or yourself if you haven't died out completely to that word do it so don't try to convince yourself you're saved if you haven't died out to the complete word of god if you haven't repent or perish but if you have do not let him back you down on that that is not the age that we live in we live in an age to where we must know who we are because if we do not know who we are and what we have received we stand no chance of changing dimensions if we are not steadfast in our belief of what we are here and now how do we think we're going to have rapturing faith to project us into another dimension you get there brother branham says it does not change anything you take what you are with you if you're a hot head here you'll be a hot haired head there what makes you think that we can stand here as a wishy-washy not knowing whether we're the bride of jesus christ and then suddenly change dimensions and be like oh yes i'm the bride of jesus christ no you're going to have to know that beforehand it's not going to it's not going to change when you get to that dimension because you're not going to get to that dimension and i can say that with an understanding that it's not changing whether you're bright or not you can be standing here and that applies to you and your bride but what i can say is we're not changing this dimension until all of us brian members come to that perfect revelation so you're going to come to it if your bride you're going to come to that i'm not preaching this is like you might miss it you're not going to miss it you're going to catch that revelation but i would say do that tonight do that here do that now don't wait be honest with yourself look inside allow the word to come and discern between your spirit and your soul and really really get real with god and say have i completely died out to my own thinking in my own ways and am i solely resting on the voice your voice he the spirit of truth and if you're not you're on treacherous ground because his rod and his staff is on the way but if you are allow that rod and that staff to be a comfort to you brother branham says we have the devil's answer and i want to declare that tonight that we have the devil's answer we do not have to be pushed to and fro we do not have to be unsettled we do not have to be unstable we do not have to have a nervous tension dictate our life we have the devil's answer of whether i am right with god or not farther more we have the devil's answer of whether god is in me or not god is his word and if i have died to myself and i am living by his word brother branham said in the church age book would not a life being manifested by the word be the word if you are manifesting the word there's only one way you can do that and that is if you are the word so this is not a message to put somebody in or take somebody out i don't have the power to do that i wish i did but i don't he alone has that but he has sent a word to make us recognize who we are and what we have and i just and i'm just you know i've been myself tonight i hope that's okay but i just i just don't like it i don't like it when i see a people who has the answer to something be pushed about i don't i don't want to be wishy-washy myself and i don't want to be i don't want to be around people that are wishy-washy i want to be a part of a local body who knows who they are and does not have to back up on that and again we are not preaching sinless perfection i'm talking when i say a body who knows who they are there is nothing wrong with recognizing that i'm somebody who made a mistake this morning but i repented of it and i made it right and now i am manifesting the word we get so so many people get confused oh lord have mercy help me we there's this saying that drives me nuts when they talk about brother branham they say well the word that he brought is my absolute but the man's not my absolute drives me nuts because this was a man i will remind you that god asked him to walk with him and changed his atoms as the wave sheath that what brought him to this atom changing is the same faith that's going to bring me to my atom changing so you when you can come and properly divide to me what part was the man and what part was the word then i'm okay with that saying but until you can divide to me what part was the word and what part was the man i'm going to say that brother william branham was my absolute and the word that was in him literally changed his body i'm okay with that now don't think that i'm so naive that i'm saying he didn't make mistakes because he did but allow me to say this is not repentance part of the word so if he made a mistake and he's repenting and he makes that right is he still not manifesting the true word now what would be a problem is if he made a mistake or he willfully send and he willfully did something wrong and he did not repent and line that up with the word but this was a voice that was so clear and this was a wave sheep and a manifestation that was so clear not only would he do it and go and make it right and continue manifesting the word but he would come and declare it from behind the pulpit and if i'm wrong when that god have mercy on me but i don't feel that i am praise god i have no problem saying that he brother william branham was my absolute because he he manifested the whole word repent i'll say it again repentance and recognizing you're wrong and did something wrong and made a mistake and correcting it and lining it up with the word that's still part of the word and it's only a problem and a deviation away from the word if you don't do that you know why i want that to be true and why i believe that's true is because i need that to be true not carnally spiritually because if that's not true for him i don't stand a chance because i made a mistake today probably more than i even know about and i'm probably going to make a mistake tomorrow but it does not change the fact that i have the capability to say look at the word and say that was wrong die to my own will go and make that right and keep manifesting the word the only other option that you have is to demonstrate sinless perfection in your flesh and if you can do that i'm perfectly fine with that but until somebody can demonstrate that to me i'm going to say that i'm comfortable with the voice that was declared through william branham and through even his hybrid flesh as being my absolute because it consistently and until his dying day and leaving this dimension subjected himself soul spirit and body to the word of god that is my goal and he did it why can that not be my absolute in the entire package repentance is part of the word and if it's manifested it's still the word manifesting now granted it's probably not not the most glorious manifestation that we want it's probably not the one that we're most comfortable with it's probably not the one that you want to brag about to your friends but just because you think i'm completely crazy i would remind you of what he said in the church age book of all of the things that brother branham said the last day bride's zeal could be he said the zeal of the last day bright would be to repent amen praise god so if you've come to sinless perfection and you don't need to repent anymore that probably means you're not part of the last day bride because you don't have brazil the zeal of the last day bride is to repent repent recognize there is a slight deviation of the word in my life and line it back up with the true word remember what it says in revelation chapter 5 5 we touched on that last service the root and offspring of david a man who'd done many many things wrong and would consistently say i am wrong the word is right help me to line up to that word we are not getting very far at all that's okay first john 3 8 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil i kind of got ahead of myself when i was talking about this but again this is why the seals had to be loosed the seals weren't just loose to reveal christ although it was just loose to reveal christ but christ being revealed was for one purpose per the scripture the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works may i interject the tactics of the devil that's why he had to be manifest so that we could destroy the tactics of the devil brother rehner said in the church edge book when he was baptizing in jordan the word of god jesus came to him the word always comes to the truly spirit field the word always comes to the truly spirit field so if you think you're filled with a spirit you may be but if you want to check what spirit that is see if the word comes and backs up that spirit that is the evidence of being filled with the holy ghost did you notice that jesus said that the world could not receive the holy ghost well in this verse i just read neither could they receive the word i think i've beat that quite a bit that we get the point they were declaring that we have the holy spirit but they didn't have the word so jesus comes along and he says you can't accept my word therefore you do not have my spirit we cannot receive he the spirit of truth without receiving he the word that is the form that he has chose to come in and that is the form that we must accept him in and if we have accepted him in that form do not allow a spirit to deceive you out of what you have received be comfortable in it being as simple as what it really is i want you to note very carefully that jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of god for your age evidence has to do with receiving the word tell me if i'm crazy but has not the religious world made it everything but that they have made it everything but that but let's come back to the simplicity of the gospel let's come back to the comforter because if we allow it to be everything that the religious world has made it you talk about a nervous tension you're never going to be settled you will never be steadfast your heart will never have peace but if and again that defies the whole purpose of the comforter so if the comforter that you have is not comforting you i would say that you have the wrong comforter and i would offer you the right comforter receiving the true word of god for your at your age from he whom he hath sent there is nothing else that will comfort you like that comfort saints there is nothing else that can bring that there is nothing else that has that capability but allow it to be as simple as what it is in first corinthians 14 37 it says if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write into you are the commandments of the lord now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow acknowledge and follow you all thought that i'd gone away from my legal legalistic side didn't you no no no it's not all grace it's not all grace to acknowledge and follow what god's prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order paul had to say those who claimed another revelation verse 36 what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only the evidence of a spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the word of god we should take great comfort in that the evidence of a spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the truth or word but to receive the truth word and to believe and obey it i'll say that with a stern voice to believe and obey it the bride of jesus christ is a very special class of people you can never make it too little too legalistic for the bride of jesus christ and you can never make it too much grace for the bride of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ is the only one that can receive a statement such as if you don't line up with the true word of god you're lost but if you line up with the true word of god you can't be lost but the bride of jesus christ don't have the capability to be lost so they're going to line up with the true word of god so you can preach it as tight as you need to preach it and they'll still line up or you can preach it as loose as what you want to preach it and they'll still line up it's a it's a very unusual class of people because it's the only class of people in the face of the earth that i can come and i can preach the gospel and i can say you go and do what you really want to do i give you complete liberty go and do what your heart's desirous and it'll work for the bride of jesus christ and then i can come over here and say don't do anything and check everything that you do and don't you dare deviate from one of the commandments of the word and they'll say amen to one and amen to the other because the bride of jesus christ has something in her heart that nobody else has and at the end of the end of the end of the end people are really going to do what they want to do anyhow so i can preach it tight i can preach it really tight and it's still not going to save you if you're unsavable and at the end of the day like i can preach it so tight that i can make you line up for months and months and months and then at the end of it you're still going to go do what you want to do anyhow like it might be the last 30 seconds of this of this earth but you're still going to go do what you want to do anyhow the bride of jesus christ is a peculiar person it's a very unique class bride of jesus christ as the prophet said her heart's desire is going to be to repent and line up to the true word of god it is such a unique thing saints repentance is such a unique thing the capability to repent should never be overlooked cain could not receive the revelation but god in his mercy came down and told him just do this and he could not die to himself repent and line up to that word the bride of jesus christ you can come and again preach it as hard as you can preach it and she will repent and line up to it i'll even go so far as to say that you can preach it so tight she won't even like it she won't even enjoy it she won't she won't even come and hear that minister again but she'll still line up to the word that he spoke it is a paradox it is a paradox but cain could not grasp the revelation and even when god would come and tell him verbatim he did not have the capability to repent but the bride of jesus christ does in whatever form that word comes along tight or loose legalistic or grace she will still find the word check herself by it and line up to it that is a unique capability if we are going to live as christians we have to have his spirit we're going to wrap this up so just stay with me it's 8 30 a little after just give me a couple more minutes okay we're not going to go long i know it's a wednesday night and i'm not going to get to the end so there's no need to even try so just go a little bit farther than we're going to close it says if we are going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit if there is anything good oh boy i shouldn't have just said that before i read this quote okay if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be listen to these three things that he says now the prerequisite to this is if anything good is to come my way it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears this this we have to get this this is foundational we have to get this brother branham says if we are going to live as christians we must live by his spirit and if there's anything good to come by my way meaning if god is going to bring anything good by my way it has to do three things it has to be revealed by the spirit what capability do you have to make the spirit reveal something to you i'll answer it for you none this is grace this is pure grace this is nothing but grace this is predestination at its finest in order for god to do anything good with you he has to bring his spirit by your way that's first and foremost you will never progress spiritually unless this happens unless something tumbles down through a mystical channel and lodges in your heart you don't have a chance this is the first thing it has to be revealed by the spirit this is true scripturally brother iran's not out left field remember the day of pentecost it says peter stood up and he preached the gospel and their hearts were pricked without their hearts being pricked they would not have stood around for anything else you tell me what capability that they had to prick their own heart none the spirit had to come by their way and the spirit's going to be riding on one thing the word when the word comes by your way it's the spirit coming by your way it's god coming by your way when you come around and you press player you hear a minister preach the unadulterated word of god that's god coming by your way don't take it for granted don't take it for granted let him come by your way in every form that he wants to come by your way the first thing that has to happen is the spirit has to reveal something to you he says then it has to be confirmed by the word that second you will never get away from that ever it has to be confirmed by your word because if a spirit comes by your way how are you going to discern whether it is a mockery holy spirit or a spirit acting like god a religious spirit unless you have something an absolute to check it by you're going to fail unless you take it back to he whom god hath sent that spirit can be any spirit it may be the right spirit but it may be the wrong spirit and there is only one way to properly discern it is allow he whom god hath sent to discern it for you that is the one and only way now when i'm preaching this i'm preaching this when as i said from a what we would term a salvation standpoint or as a spiritual maturing standpoint i'm not talking that if the spirit reveals to you don't go down this street tomorrow and make sure you go to work five minutes earlier i'm not talking about those what we would call very specific intimate um revealings of the spirit you understand what i'm saying because you say all of the spirit i just feel to go to work early tomorrow like there's an unction telling me i need to go early okay well then you read in the newspaper the next day the time that you would have been going through the intersect we we've all experienced this have we not we've all seen these that's not what i'm talking about because if you try to check that by the word you're going to be like i don't see anything in here about the intersection of elm and worth like can't be the word so i'm going to work right on time no that's not what i'm talking about brother branham says that god can do things outside of his word now he will never violate the principles of his word to do that never but when he's saying god can do things outside of his word meaning god can do things very specific for us on an individual level in our daily lives that you're not going to find a scripture or a quote for but that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about what we would say foundational truths as re as relating to receiving the holy spirit the new birth and the token so everybody understand me where i'm coming from has to be revealed by the spirit it has to be confirmed by his word and remember the word is a person so when we're talking doctrine it's going to be confirmed by the written word when we're talking specifics in your life it has to line up with the nature of the word and the principles of the word so you can still check those things that come by your way like if something tells you to advance and invest all your money in this i would be checking that by the nature of the world the word not the world by the word so if it's telling you to invest all your money in marijuana grow operations i would probably check that by the nature of the word you understand it works both ways so just because you can't find a scripture it says don't invest in drug operations don't don't think you're ever going to get away from the nature of the word but as we're speaking doctrine it has to be confirmed by the word as interpreted by the prophet revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and here comes my legalist legalistic side again made manifest by the results that it bears so if the results and the manifestation of your daily life is not one that matches the nature of the word the spirit of the word and the written word you do not have the holy ghost that's hard i know that's the truth somebody needs to hear it but if it does you cannot produce that which means you have the holy ghost you should take great comfort in that it's very very simple so let's back up a step if the manifestation of your daily life does not match the principles and the nature of the word the person of christ and his written word you do not have he the spirit of truth you do not have the token you do not have the holy ghost you do not have the new birth that would be a problem if you didn't have access to it but you do not have to walk out those doors tonight without it it's a very very simple process because god has given us a word and all that you have to do tonight to change that condition is be real and be honest and admit to god that you've been putting on a show for a long time and that you are tired of doing that and that you want the real goods and that you want the person of christ and from this night forward you are dying out to your own interpretation of the message and just taking it as he whom he had sent declared it that in itself gives you access to he the spirit of truth it is your choice if you walk out these doors without the new birth tonight you do not have to come here and fast you do not have to come here and pray you do not have to come here and cry you do not have to shout you do not have to jump you do not have to dance you do not have to do anything tonight other than admit that you are completely and utterly wrong and that he whom god hath sent is right and you take the word as he has declared that is the only requirement now that spirit will come right in behind you and say that right in behind that statement he'll say it's not that easy but let me expose that spirit for you because there was a great important person that came to the prophet one time and he says i need healing in my body he says okay just go jump in the river seven times you'll be fine it says on no no no it can't be that simple it can't be that simple just do what the prophet said do spirits don't die spirits don't die we have spent the religious world has spent thousands and thousands of years writing that spirit it can't be that simple just do what the prophet said do just go dunk seven times and i'll be fine it's the same spirit that wants to come to church tonight because religious religion is his business and tell you after that i just declared to you the only thing you have to do to have god indwelling in you is die to yourself and receive he the spirit of truth the words the truth as declared by the prophet of this age that will come along and say no it's not that easy he doesn't know my past he doesn't know where i really am at he doesn't know what's really going on with me and i will just admit i don't don't have a clue don't have a clue if god reveals something then that's that's one thing but standing here right now i don't have a clue i don't need to have a clue because he the spirit of truth does know and i'm preaching what paul preached and i'm preaching what brother branham preached and it's still good tonight if brother branham was standing here you would say he has the capability to look into my life and see what's going on and he could say those things but just because that gift of discernment is not here does not mean that the words that that gift that that voice spoke is not still accurate furthermore it shows signs of maturity in a people that they don't have to have that gift to declare those things and still recognize that what he said is truth because brother branham says that the point of all of those gifts was just to bring attention to the voice and make you god conscious to make you realize that he's here and that what he's saying is true i want to encourage you to allow it to be as simple as what it is and don't leave this building tonight washi washi you do not have to leave this building wondering you can come to an individual proper understanding whether or not you have completely died out to the voice that has been sent to you you have that capability if you are in your right mind tonight you have that capability to search your life to search your soul and be real with god and ask yourself that question am i still hanging on to my own ideas about something and i would venture to say that it's probably not what we would consider a dirty idea or a sinful idea it's sinful because it would be against the word but i'm not talking about schmutty dirty living i'm talking about a slight deviation away from the word to still hold on to something that you want check yourself check yourself it really is that simple and if that is the case i would just encourage you to manifest the word repent make it right and believe on the word yield to the word receive he the spirit of truth tonight again it is by your own choice if you walk out those doors without the holy spirit the religious world will tell you it's a seven days process it's a ten day process it's a fast and a prey and a slobber and whatever else and i'm not against any of that it may be that way but it doesn't have to be that way death to self entitles you to the token that is the only requirement you cannot get around it there's no wiggle room with it like there's only one requirement but like it is a requirement like there's no wiggle room musicians please come there's no wiggle room with it you're not going to get around it but if you meet that requirement allow it to stand for what it stands for and allow the results to be what the results what the scripture says god himself says if you will do this i promise i will do this that is his promise and now we have a prophet come on the scene and says that he wants to do his part more than what you want him to but you have to die to yourself you have to do the one thing that cain wasn't able to do you have to do the one thing that that mockery holy spirit does not want you to do die to yourself if we are going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results that it bears you don't have to worry about this spirit producing the life it's going to produce or you're going to blow up this is the life of god you think the life of god is going to come into your being and not produce itself not a chance it will produce itself it will manifest itself in diverse ways but don't try to make your manifestation match somebody else's manifestation because then what you've done is you've made them your absolute instead of the word you're absolute their manifestation may be right but it does not have to be your manifestation all of our manifestations have to be believing on he whom he had sent and dying to ourselves does that make sense to everybody is everybody on the same page did i preach it too hard did i preach it too soft comments questions i want to go one step farther here and then we're going to sing i promise the holy spirit as defined by the scripture is he the spirit of truth that will reveal to you things which are remember the scripture says this to reveal to you things which are remember when peter received the holy spirit he stood up and he said this is that right so the holy spirit comes on the scene and it reveals to you this is that but the scripture also says it will re will reveal to you things that are to come so it doesn't just reveal this is that it reveals things to come now this is imperative to bring us to a settledness those of you that are sitting here who have received the holy spirit but are still unsettled here's your answer here's your answer because it is a working of the holy spirit the holy spirit works so it reveals to you things which are as in i'm a hopeless cause i need help i'm lost i need saved that is a working of the holy spirit right but that is not the end of the holy spirit and that's where people get confused because they'll accept that portion and repent and accept a savior and accept the word and then three days later they trip and they fall and they say i thought i had it but obviously i don't but the holy spirit is to reveal to you the problem and say this is that you're a sinner you need saved you're hopeless you need hope you're lost you need saved that is what's revealing things that are present tense but it does not stop there per the scriptures the scripture says it will continue to reveal to you things that are so now that you've received the true baptism of the holy spirit and the true birth allow it to be what it is but do not think for a second that it's not going to do what the scripture says that it's going to do and the scripture says it's going to continue to reveal to you things that are a lot of people think that's doctrinally speaking and that's prophetic speaking and it is but that's not what i'm concerned about because i can live without those things just don't freeze it up on me don't freeze up he says satan's not concerned about how right you are in your doctrine if you miss the life you're not going to come up anyhow will the doctrine be there absolutely but the life has to be there the spirit has to be there the new birth has to be there so i can on an individual basis function and be fine without those things because god will set gifts in the church to bring those things to me but as an individual i cannot progress without the new birth i have to have that but this holy spirit will continue to reveal things that are meaning you did this today and it doesn't line up with my word amen so now it does not do away with what the holy spirit revealed back here as in things that were you had a problem you needed fixed got that taken care of the scripture says he's not going to stop there he is going to continue to reveal to you things that will be meaning you will still have problems you will be in problems he will continue to reveal to you you are a problem i'm preaching what paul preached i beat myself black and blue daily i want to do right but i can't will somebody help me do you think for a second paul was not converted paul was converted but the holy spirit i know shocking was doing what the holy spirit said it would do in the scripture it continued to reveal to him his problems things that will be don't get those too confused allow there to be an experience allow there to be an experience of a new birth and allow it to be steadfast brother brandon referred to it as a thai post allow it to be concrete never deviating if you have that experience if you don't get it but if you have it don't deviate away from it and don't get confused by the working of the holy spirit you do not need to be reborn born again what you need to do is be borned again and allow the spirit to continue to reveal to you things that are the holy spirit does two three things it comes and it reveals to you you got a problem and you need to fix it you have to do that three things you have a problem and you need to fix it you have a problem you need to repent god cannot repent for you that is the only power that you have i promise we're closing after these three things you the only power you have is the power to repent that is the threefold manifestation of the holy spirit it comes to you and it reveals to you you have a problem you need to do something about it you have to repent now because we've been around the message and we have proper teaching with i would say within the ranks of the message we're privileged because when it comes and it does that it can also reveal to us things that are manifesting in our life that we need to lay down like we don't have to wonder whether it's right to smoke and if you're smoking quit it there are some people with their willpower they can receive that they can recognize its anti-word they can lay it down and stop that is the working of the first phase you got a problem fix it repent and his brother uh branham taught us there's things it's just our reasonable duty if it's wrong lay it down quit doing it start dressing right start acting right like don't ask the holy spirit to do something for you you can do yourself and you know to do you understand but now we come to the second phase and the second phase is you recognize you have a problem and you have no power to overcome it you still have the holy spirit this is simply another face he reveals to you the things that are you have a problem you need to fix it okay lord i have done all that i know to do and all that i can do but i still have this in my life and i cannot overcome it you are not lost you still have the holy spirit the holy spirit is now working so now what it does is you repent of that and you acknowledge the fact that you have no capability to make yourself right now he is released to do the second fold of the holy spirit he has come on the scene and he is going to fix and help you overcome what you know is wrong in your life but that's the second phase but now we come to the third phase and it's we're still born again we still have the token we still have he the spirit of truth but the third phase is where people get confused because the third phase is when he really comes and shows you things that are because now there are problems in your life that you don't even know about how can you repent of something when you don't even know there's a problem you say that's impossible oh no it's not no it's not because it's bred into us and a sea bolt has a really hard time seeing sea bolt problems it's all that a seabolt ever knows so if a seatbelt has problems looking and understanding what a seabolt's problem is who do you think is going to affect seabolt's problems holy spirit has to come on the scene and do what the holy spirit does reveal to you that things that are and will be uh the holy this is why your brother and your sister can come to you and be like hey have you ever thought about this like maybe that's not exactly right and you're like that's embarrassing not sure how i missed that one okay i'm the only one praise the lord your dna and hybridization is so strong it's blinding that is why iron sharpeneth iron and your brother and sister you all are i know you believe this because we do it all the time we look at each other we're like what is wrong with that guy like problem we can't see it saints a sibolt cannot see a seabolt's problem echola cannot see a coal ass problem i can go down the list if you want me to i have amazing discernment right now we cannot see our own problems therefore we by default are hopeless at the end of the day we can do what we know to do is right and it's filthy rags we can even acknowledge lord i got a problem and i can't overcome it and he can come and he can fix it for us but when we end up at that third phase the final phase of of perfection we have got to come and be real with god god i know i've got problems that i don't even know about you have got to come and reveal them to me so that i can make them right and when you come to that level don't think for a second that your your new birth went anywhere because if you ask him that question he's going to start revealing things to you and you're probably going to feel like he was never born again because when somebody comes along when a cola comes along and tells the sea ball to sibo's problem it's like yeah that's embarrassing i don't know how i missed that clearly i don't have the holy ghost that's how obvious and simple they'll be that's why we have to allow he the spirit of truth to continue to work to be steadfast steadfast in our experience don't deviate away from your experience if you don't have one get one if you're not born again die to yourself be born again but if you've been born again do not deviate away from that but allow him to continue to work let's sing amen please save me from myself [Music] [Music] it's not in one dream but in praise that we find the strength [Music] but in praise let's just pray together then we'll be dismissed you're obviously more than welcome to stand worship if you would like but i know it's getting late precious lord jesus we just want to thank you once again for this time of fellowship that you've given us lord and i pray that you would just come now lord and ride upon the words that have went forth and accomplish that which they've been intended to do lord i pray that there's if there's any under the sound of my voice lord that have not had that true born again token experience that you would come tonight and you would grant them that lord may there not be an individual walk out of these doors that have not completely died to themselves and given over to the truth as revealed by the voice that you have sent to us lord and as such if if we would do that part which is the only part we can do i pray that you would come and that you would fulfill your promise and that you would fill each and every one with the holy spirit he the spirit of truth father we would just ask that you would be with our pastor and brother ilia as their way lord would you just anoint them mightily and supernaturally for the work that they're doing that you would bring them home safely to us at the appropriate time father we just ask that you would be with the people now as they would continue through the week no doubt that many of them have to go to work tomorrow and the rest of the week just pray that you would anoint them lord and may we move forward steadfastly and unshakeable knowing what you have done for us lord but at the same time may we move forward humbly knowing that if you don't come on the scene and continue to reveal things that are in our life that are wrong we have no ability to line them up with your word father may we submit ourselves completely to you to allow you to do what you need to do to bring this bride to perfection we love you we worship you we're thankful for you lord we just honor you here tonight we give you all the glory we commit ourselves to you in the name of the lord jesus christ the bride says amen god bless you saints will just continue to sing you may be dismissed as you [Music] [Music] in like but in resting oh it's not in one drink but in praise we find the strength of the lodo one more time oh it's not in trying but in trusting [Music] oh it's not in one [Music] when we walk with the lord in the light of his word what a glory he sheds on our way and while we do his good will [Music] he abides with trusted for there's no other way to be happy in jesus but to trust [Music] [Music] not a cloud in the sky [Music] but his smile quickly drives hit away [Music] [Music] can abide [Music] for there's [Music] [Music] and [Music] is [Music] for the favor [Music] are for them who will trust obey trusted your way for there's no other way to be happy in jesus but to [Music] to trust [Music] [Music] jesus
