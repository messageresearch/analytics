[8:20] seats and we'll we'll go through some of
[8:23] our scripture reading thank you
[8:24] musicians
[8:26] amen let's go ahead and go through some
[8:29] of our scripture reading the scripture
[8:30] reading that brother brenham had at the
[8:32] beginning of this so we don't lose track
[8:34] of what he opened with and our first
[8:36] scripture will be revelations
[8:37] chapter 1 verse 17. so when the prophet
[8:40] of god started this service he
[8:42] he read three scriptural passage
[8:44] passages of scripture so we'll read
[8:45] through those
[8:46] and then in the second part we started
[8:49] with another one the fourth one we'll
[8:51] read that as well
[8:52] revelation chapter 1 verse 17.
[8:57] revelation 1 and 17 says and when i saw
[8:59] him i fell at his feet as dead
[9:01] and he laid his right hand upon me
[9:03] saying saying unto me
[9:04] fear not i am the first and the last
[9:08] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[9:10] behold
[9:11] i am alive forevermore amen and have the
[9:14] keys of hell
[9:15] and of death let's turn to romans
[9:18] chapter 8 this is the second
[9:20] portion of scripture that brother
[9:22] branham opened this service with
[9:24] romans chapter 8 verse 11.
[9:29] in romans 8 verse 11 he says but if the
[9:32] spirit of him
[9:33] that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[9:35] in you he that raised up christ from the
[9:37] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[9:39] bodies
[9:39] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[9:43] now we'll turn to mark 16 this is the
[9:45] third passage
[9:46] of scripture that he opened with mark
[9:48] chapter 16
[9:50] verses 1 and 2.
[9:56] verse 1 and when the sabbath was passed
[9:59] mary magdalene and mary the mother of
[10:01] james and
[10:02] solomy had brought sweet spices that
[10:04] they might come and anoint him
[10:06] and very early in the morning the first
[10:08] day of the week they came into the
[10:09] sepulchre
[10:10] at the rising of the sun amen part way
[10:14] into the service brother branham goes to
[10:16] another scripture that's leviticus 23
[10:18] i'd like to read that together
[10:21] leviticus chapter 23
[10:27] and verse 9.
[10:30] leviticus 23 and 9 and he read from 9
[10:34] down to 11 so we'll read those three
[10:36] verses
[10:38] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[10:40] speak unto the children of israel and
[10:41] say unto them
[10:42] when you become into the land which i
[10:44] give unto you and shall reap
[10:46] the harvest thereof then you shall bring
[10:48] a sheaf of the firstfruits of your
[10:49] harvest unto the priest
[10:51] and he shall wave the sheep before the
[10:52] lord to be accepted
[10:54] for you on the morrow after the sabbath
[10:57] the priest shall wave it
[10:58] and he and ye shall offer that day when
[11:01] you wave the sheaf and
[11:03] wave the sheaf a he lamb without blemish
[11:05] of the first year for a burnt offering
[11:07] unto the lord
[11:08] sorry i went a little further than i
[11:09] intended it was supposed to be 9 10 11.
[11:12] um so now let's take our book
[11:16] and i want to do just a little review
[11:18] before we get into the questions i'm
[11:19] just going to read
[11:20] pull a few snippets out from the
[11:21] beginning let's go all the way back to
[11:23] paragraph 23.
[11:27] paragraph 23 is on
[11:30] uh page four top portion of page four
[11:34] i always want to go and hit a few
[11:35] highlights so that we don't lose track
[11:37] of what we've journeyed through
[11:39] so far so in paragraph
[11:42] 23 he says now my text this morning i
[11:45] want to take for a text
[11:47] it is the rising of the sun and for a
[11:49] subject i want to use
[11:51] the quickening power so his text was the
[11:53] rising of the sun and he took that out
[11:55] of mark 16
[11:56] and his subject was the quickening power
[11:58] let's look over the next page at
[12:00] paragraph 29
[12:02] and 30 on page five as people today are
[12:05] trying to say we should wash feet once a
[12:07] year on thursday and on friday we should
[12:09] take the communion
[12:10] and all different doctrines they argue
[12:12] about whether it should be this day or
[12:13] that day or whether it should be a
[12:15] sabbath day
[12:15] or the first day of the week or all
[12:17] these things are just merely tradition
[12:19] tradition what good would any of it do
[12:22] you whether you had land or not lent if
[12:24] there is no life in you
[12:25] it's only a memorial which there's
[12:27] nothing against it but they have
[12:28] certainly carried out their tradition
[12:30] but left off the main thing satan
[12:33] doesn't care how religious you are how
[12:34] right you are in your doctrine
[12:36] if you miss that life you won't come up
[12:38] anyhow
[12:39] no matter how religious how good how
[12:41] many churches you belong to or will
[12:43] belong to
[12:44] it doesn't matter one thing unless you
[12:46] have been born again
[12:48] amen let's turn over to paragraph 41
[12:51] at the top of page seven
[12:57] very 41 it says but this time when the
[13:00] sun rose there was a dual sun rising
[13:03] another sun rising it was not only the
[13:05] sun rising it was the eson had risen
[13:08] to bring eternal life to all god's
[13:10] promised seed that by foreknowledge
[13:12] he had seen laying upon the earth and
[13:15] let's go to
[13:16] next page of paragraph 49 on page 8.
[13:22] he says i'm sure this morning that even
[13:24] we who believe it cannot comprehend what
[13:26] a great thing that was
[13:28] because he raised from the dead we also
[13:30] have already raised from the dead
[13:32] for we were in him man let's go to
[13:35] paragraph 54 at the top of page 9
[13:38] verse 54
[13:41] now and then not only that he sent word
[13:44] to his disciples his believing fear not
[13:46] for i am he that was dead and is alive
[13:48] again forevermore
[13:49] and i have the keys to death and hell
[13:51] i've already conquered it
[13:53] don't fear anymore for every
[13:55] foreordained predestinated seed of god
[13:57] shall come to life when that light
[13:59] spreads across the earth of the glorious
[14:01] gospel
[14:02] in every age it'll bring forth a crop
[14:04] that god ordained it to
[14:06] he had raised from the dead it's a
[14:09] guarantee friends amen
[14:11] let's go to paragraph 79
[14:15] over on page 12.
[14:22] paragraph 79 we are the benefactors of
[14:25] his resurrection quickened after being
[14:28] dead in the world in sin and trespasses
[14:30] he has quickened us together with him
[14:32] raised with him now
[14:34] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[14:36] jesus
[14:37] his his spirit brings his same life
[14:40] again on the earth
[14:41] listen his spirit brings the same life
[14:44] his same life again on the earth if the
[14:47] spirit of god that raised up christ the
[14:48] body the anointed body
[14:50] if the spirit of god anointed that body
[14:52] in such a way that when that seed fell
[14:54] in the earth he just wouldn't let him
[14:56] rest there no
[14:57] he quickened him and raised him up that
[14:59] same spirit by the same works by the
[15:01] same power
[15:02] by the same signs being you it'll also
[15:05] raise you up amen
[15:08] let's look at paragraph 89
[15:12] over on page 13. paragraph 89
[15:15] we're going to read several paragraphs
[15:16] all the way into the next page with this
[15:19] that's why they had to waive the sheaf
[15:22] where it was the first one that
[15:23] come to maturity and it was waived as a
[15:25] memorial of thanksgiving to god
[15:27] believing that the rest of them would
[15:29] come it was a sign
[15:31] and today because he was the first son
[15:32] of god to come to full maturity to be in
[15:35] god
[15:35] he was plucked up from the earth and has
[15:37] waved over the people
[15:39] oh what a glorious lesson by the
[15:40] quickening power the first one
[15:43] although he had he had been typed in
[15:45] many times as we'll see later
[15:47] that he was tight but this was really
[15:49] the first fruits of them that slept
[15:51] he was waved over the promised seed that
[15:53] had promises
[15:54] the promise of life he was waved at the
[15:57] day of pentecost when there came a sound
[15:59] from heaven like a waving
[16:00] mighty rushing wind and was waved over
[16:03] the people the pentecostal people that
[16:05] was up at pentecost
[16:06] waiting for the blessing to come and to
[16:08] be waived again we realize in the last
[16:11] day according to luke 17
[16:12] 30 and the sunday again and the day that
[16:15] the
[16:15] s-o-n of man will be revealed or waved
[16:18] again over the people
[16:19] now who is the son of man in the
[16:21] beginning was the word and the word was
[16:23] with god and the word was god
[16:25] and the word was the word was made flesh
[16:27] and dwelt among us
[16:28] and if all the teaching that we have had
[16:30] and the confirmation of the word of god
[16:32] by word of god
[16:33] by signs by wonders we see today that in
[16:36] the book of luke here that
[16:38] that as we just quoted or the luke the
[16:41] 17th chapter in the 30th verse and
[16:42] malachi 4 and the different scriptures
[16:44] that we are acquainted with
[16:46] that that word again is waved over the
[16:47] people that the dead traditions of man
[16:49] is dead
[16:50] and the son of god is alive again with
[16:52] the baptism of the holy spirit right
[16:54] among us
[16:55] and is giving us life as christ was the
[16:58] first one to raise from all the prophets
[17:00] and so forth although typed in many
[17:02] places
[17:02] he was the first fruits of those that
[17:04] slept and the bride coming of christ
[17:06] coming out of the church they'll have to
[17:08] be a sheaf waved again
[17:10] in the last days oh my waving of the
[17:12] sheaf what was the sheaf the first one
[17:14] that come to mature
[17:16] the first one that proved it was a wheat
[17:18] that proved it was a sheaf
[17:20] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[17:22] talking about
[17:23] it was waved over the people and the
[17:25] first time there will come
[17:26] forth for the bright age for a
[17:28] resurrection out of dark
[17:30] denominationalism will be a message that
[17:33] the full maturity of the word has turned
[17:35] back again in its full power
[17:37] and being waved over the people by the
[17:38] same signs and wonders that he did
[17:40] back there because i live ye live also
[17:44] speaking to his wife
[17:45] because i live ye live also what a
[17:47] resurrection that was
[17:48] and what a resurrection this is to be
[17:51] quickened from the
[17:52] dead to be made alive in christ jesus by
[17:55] god's quickening power
[17:56] he was waved to them the word which he
[17:58] was was waved back to them on the day of
[18:00] pentecost
[18:01] the word made manifest now and as i say
[18:04] it's to be waved again
[18:06] in the last day praise god
[18:10] it's been waved friends the word made
[18:13] manifest
[18:14] has been waived let's go to paragraph
[18:16] 154
[18:19] and that'll be found over on page 21.
[18:25] paragraph 154 at the bottom of page
[18:28] 21. but brother when you hear the scream
[18:32] there's something
[18:32] in you you're an eagle to begin with why
[18:35] you are that seed
[18:37] that that the resurrection of the s-o-n
[18:40] has drawn
[18:41] and the wave sheep upon the earth to
[18:43] make you recognize that you are an eagle
[18:45] and not a denominational chicken
[18:47] now we talk about the wave sheath right
[18:49] and we understand
[18:50] that god took the first one to prove
[18:52] that it was a mature seed
[18:54] amen and he waved it over the people the
[18:56] son of man ministry the word made
[18:58] manifest has been waived in this day
[19:00] but now he comes and he says that the
[19:03] resurrection of the s.o.n has dawned and
[19:05] the wave chief upon the earth
[19:07] to make you recognize that you are an
[19:09] eagle why was the wave sheep waved upon
[19:11] the earth so that you would recognize
[19:13] you're an eagle and not a denominational
[19:15] chicken
[19:16] so that you would see something
[19:17] different so you would see the word made
[19:18] manifest you would see the reality of a
[19:20] living word the scriptures made alive
[19:22] and you would know i'm not this but i'm
[19:24] that
[19:25] that wave sheath was waved so that you
[19:28] would recognize
[19:31] and the wave sheep upon the earth to
[19:32] make you recognize that you are an eagle
[19:34] and not a denominational chicken you see
[19:36] it
[19:37] ha if the spirit that raised him from
[19:39] the dead
[19:40] the word the dynamic of the word dwells
[19:43] in you it also quickens your mortal body
[19:45] now how we now how we flesh of his flesh
[19:48] and bone of his bone
[19:49] because quickly while you were yet
[19:51] mortal sinners morty mortal ready to die
[19:54] these bodies it quickened that body
[19:56] what's quicken
[19:57] brings to life the spirit that once
[19:59] liked to drink to run around to commit
[20:01] adultery and all these things
[20:02] it quickened why the thing died and you
[20:05] are resurrected it quickens your mortal
[20:07] body
[20:08] therefore your bodies is the temple of
[20:10] the dynamics because why
[20:12] from the beginning you are part of the
[20:14] mechanics oh
[20:15] there is your resurrection there is the
[20:18] church
[20:18] in the resurrection with him these
[20:21] bodies right now are quickened
[20:23] so you've heard you believed it changed
[20:25] you from a denomination
[20:27] to the word praise god this
[20:30] is the resurrection amen you're part of
[20:33] that resurrection you're
[20:34] in this resurrection you've experienced
[20:36] this resurrection
[20:37] it's going on now amen paragraph 191
[20:42] this is the last one we'll read and then
[20:44] we'll get into our questions
[20:46] paragraph 191 on page 25.
[20:52] now when you get the dynamics you have
[20:53] been quickened from mortal to
[20:55] immortality
[20:56] it makes the whole body come subject to
[20:58] the word
[20:59] it'll make you act different look
[21:01] different live different it'll just make
[21:03] you different
[21:04] now look ben quickened you who were once
[21:06] dead in sin and trespasses and darkness
[21:08] has he quickened
[21:09] what by his spirit that raised up jesus
[21:12] on easter morning from the dead
[21:14] and if it dwells in your mortal bodies
[21:15] now watch it also quickens brings the
[21:18] life
[21:18] makes it subject to the word now how can
[21:21] you claim to have that spirit and throw
[21:22] yourself away from the word
[21:24] you're quickened by something else for
[21:26] it will quicken your mortal bodies to
[21:28] the word
[21:29] sure it will amen
[21:32] praise the lord all right
[21:36] can we pull up this powerpoint we'll go
[21:37] ahead and go to our questions
[21:41] we are going to begin on page 30
[21:45] at paragraph 230. so we're going to
[21:47] start at page 30 on paragraph
[21:49] 230 that's towards the top of the page
[21:51] and we're going to go all the way to the
[21:53] end of the message
[21:54] all the way through his prayer at the
[21:55] end so let's look at our questions here
[21:58] and you can write these down if you wish
[22:00] to
[22:01] first question what three steps must you
[22:04] take
[22:04] to walk the highway to heaven's doors
[22:09] now sometimes these questions i write
[22:11] they may sound a little funny in their
[22:12] grammar the way they're written
[22:14] but i wrote it that way for a reason
[22:16] because there's a certain way something
[22:17] is spoken by the prophet
[22:19] so we want to catch that what three
[22:20] steps must you take to walk the highway
[22:23] to heaven's doors like i said before
[22:26] there's no trick questions these all
[22:28] come in chronological order
[22:30] i mean it just helps us stay focused and
[22:32] glean nuggets
[22:33] out of the message
[22:37] question one again what three steps must
[22:39] you take
[22:40] to walk the highway
[22:44] highway to heaven's doors

[23:22] and question number three what is
[23:26] the opening of the seals
[23:35] what is the opening of the seals

[23:47] so many good nuggets here
[23:51] question three what is the opening of
[23:53] the seals
[23:54] and question number four what does the
[23:57] breaking of the easter seal from around
[23:59] our lives
[24:02] reveal
[24:05] question number four what does the
[24:07] breaking of the easter seal
[24:10] from around our lives reveal
[24:17] these are so exciting i want to just
[24:19] blurt it out
[24:21] but we'll wait
[24:26] once again question number four what
[24:29] does the breaking
[24:30] of the easter seal from around our lives
[24:33] reveal
[24:37] all right let's go ahead and go to the
[24:38] tape we're going to begin like i said on
[24:40] page 30. so if you want to turn to page
[24:42] 30
[24:43] we'll begin a paragraph 230. so brother
[24:45] franco if you want to go ahead and start
[24:48] the tape
[24:51] now load it quick them into the presence
[24:54] of god why
[24:55] it was the spirit of god that raised up
[24:57] jesus from the grave
[24:59] and the spirit of god are given that
[25:01] eternal life comes from the greek word
[25:02] if you look up zoe
[25:04] which moves it through you
[25:07] and then quickens their even their mind
[25:13] how can you say that that spirit dwells
[25:16] in you
[25:19] though you've done everything that you
[25:20] thought was right here's your evidence
[25:22] when you got it now
[25:24] if the spirit that was in crisis
[25:28] in you it also
[25:31] quickened you to the word for he is the
[25:34] word
[25:35] and if he contrary quickens you away
[25:37] from the word then it isn't the spirit
[25:39] of christ
[25:42] care what you've done until that moves
[25:44] you in the word
[25:46] my sheep hear my voice and they shall
[25:48] live by
[25:49] every word every word
[25:52] i was talking about the other day my own
[25:54] mother
[25:55] she's going on now and she was a very
[25:58] odd woman
[25:59] and she was you know about half indian
[26:02] and she was
[26:03] up but in there she was a person who
[26:05] didn't dream
[26:06] but all i think she had four or five
[26:07] dreams all of her life but every time
[26:09] she dreams a dream
[26:11] it was true she had a dream it was true
[26:15] i remember one time i first started
[26:16] preaching many years ago was living
[26:18] right up here on the road right just
[26:20] above here
[26:21] i was preaching right at this church she
[26:23] dreamed the dream that i was standing
[26:25] here by the side of a three step
[26:29] and i was standing preaching to
[26:30] everybody that they must walk up these
[26:32] three steps
[26:34] before they hit the highway and on the
[26:37] highways a little
[26:38] pearly like white line runs right into
[26:41] the
[26:42] the doors of heaven to the pearly gate
[26:44] and that pearl has been stretched out to
[26:46] the top of these steps
[26:47] if that ain't my message exactly today
[26:50] justification sanctification
[26:50] sanctifications
[26:52] and i was saying that a person has to
[26:55] come
[26:55] by these three steps to be able to walk
[26:57] that highway
[26:59] and said that there was a lady came by
[27:01] now you know what kind of shoes people
[27:02] wore
[27:03] 35 years ago but there's a lady come by
[27:05] i have a great big pair of the actually
[27:07] where today spike your shoes
[27:09] and she come by and i said wait a minute
[27:11] sister you can't walk that highway there
[27:14] and i think you can't beat it and she
[27:16] said um
[27:23] i'll show you i can be justified
[27:25] sanctified and deal with the holy ghost
[27:26] still wants it
[27:27] and she i just let her go couldn't do no
[27:29] more about it couldn't stop her
[27:30] and she jumped up on the highway to look
[27:32] back your sister said yeah i told you
[27:33] she started to run up and she you know
[27:35] what the bible said in isaiah fifth
[27:37] chapter
[27:38] that you have outstretched neck they
[27:41] have to
[27:41] pitch over see
[27:44] missing as hefty accurate as we go
[27:48] making a tinkling with her heels
[27:50] her daughter's design in the last thing
[27:52] and she started up that highway just as
[27:54] hard as she could run
[27:55] and as while the road got narrower in
[27:57] there she started really
[27:58] missing like that and off she went
[28:01] mother said the harvest screams that
[28:03] i've heard in my life with that woman
[28:05] falling into those flames and smoke
[28:06] going down down like that i turn around
[28:08] said see
[28:10] she just obeyed everything but one word
[28:16] see everything but one word sure
[28:18] pentecostal women can be saved
[28:20] sanctified and deal with the holy ghost
[28:22] and then faith
[28:25] absolutely mention lightly by bread
[28:27] alone but by every word
[28:30] see and she failed it and as i said see
[28:32] she went on in all right
[28:34] but she she failed to listen tell her
[28:37] what was ahead
[28:39] and he's wrote the gospel by the
[28:41] disciples apostles and doctrines of the
[28:43] apostles and prophets
[28:45] and so forth and they won't listen
[28:48] followers this creating power is zoey
[28:51] bringing the word
[28:52] the mind that was in christ within you
[28:55] then
[28:56] i'm trying to show you that you when you
[29:00] uh raised when god raised jesus from the
[29:03] dead
[29:04] he raised up you also and also
[29:07] quicken to life with him you are now
[29:10] quick and lie
[29:11] although banned you were but an
[29:13] attribute in his thoughts
[29:15] but god has saw all in him
[29:18] at the finish see when god looked down
[29:21] upon the body the spirit left him in the
[29:23] garden against him and he had to die a
[29:24] man
[29:25] remember friends he didn't have to do
[29:27] that
[29:29] that was god god anointed that flesh
[29:33] which is human flesh and he didn't if he
[29:35] went after his god
[29:36] he never died that kind of death thank
[29:39] kill god
[29:40] but he didn't have to do it but remember
[29:43] he
[29:44] went there with you in him
[29:48] see god had never separated the bride
[29:53] from the groom yet so when god looked
[29:56] down
[29:56] upon the body of christ he saw both
[29:59] neglect females
[30:01] it was all redeeming that one body
[30:05] see they are one
[30:08] same same word the same word spoke of
[30:11] the groom speaks to the bride
[30:13] well how can the bride come and fail to
[30:16] manifest everything was promised of him
[30:18] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[30:20] the bride but when he did everything
[30:22] even to prove it by raising himself up
[30:24] from the dead
[30:25] afterwards then don't the group the
[30:27] bride have to do the same thing
[30:29] has to be exactly what the word said
[30:30] should be in these last things
[30:33] don't you have to return to your mouth
[30:34] before don't you have to be manifested
[30:36] like wasn't the days of sodom
[30:37] don't the world have to be just exactly
[30:39] like it is isn't these things a perfect
[30:41] identification of the word of god
[30:44] made known to us well friends i know i'm
[30:47] keeping you a long time 15 minutes yet
[30:48] so dinner
[30:49] but maybe i'll get through but then but
[30:51] notice looking here
[30:52] what a perfect thing it is i don't want
[30:54] to see it against me
[30:55] look notice this but god foresaw
[30:59] the bride in the groom
[31:04] hallelujah see to save his wife like
[31:08] adam
[31:09] he had to go with her i had him know
[31:12] what he was doing
[31:13] he didn't know what she was doing but
[31:15] adam walked out with his wife
[31:17] see and jesus took his wife's place
[31:22] and became sin for her remember he
[31:25] became
[31:25] you he stood your punishment that you
[31:29] might stand in his place
[31:30] he stood in your place that you might
[31:33] stand in his place
[31:35] what a love what a fellowship how can we
[31:38] deny how can we do
[31:40] anything but love him friend uh she
[31:42] could stay on ours but let's move on
[31:44] for it right uh
[31:47] the pentecostal experience today and the
[31:49] coming
[31:50] of the holy ghost in this last days as
[31:52] promised is like the
[31:54] abstract to a title deed
[31:57] see now you can get a title sure
[32:01] okay you can get a title to your place
[32:03] but that's still going to say it's yours
[32:05] no sir somebody way back energy come in
[32:08] and put a claim on it
[32:09] but when you get an abstract
[32:14] that shows that everything is ever
[32:15] against it is struck off
[32:18] coming back from the foundation is that
[32:19] right and when a man
[32:22] has said that he believes the word and
[32:25] then when the holy spirit comes it
[32:28] is the abstract to the title and that
[32:31] gives you permission when you have that
[32:33] abstract and
[32:34] every bit of that belongs to you and
[32:36] everything's on it belongs to you
[32:40] hey and that gives
[32:43] us the abstract when the holy ghost
[32:46] comes upon this pile of eve
[32:48] that god saw back on her for the
[32:51] foundation of the world and put a name
[32:52] on the book of life but was born through
[32:54] a man and woman
[32:55] and subject to sin and guilty of sin
[32:58] but when i believed on it i received the
[33:01] deed
[33:02] but when the holy ghost comes it was the
[33:04] abstract
[33:06] that everything against me whether my
[33:08] mother done it my father done it my
[33:10] grandmother earned it like a little
[33:12] epileptic child
[33:12] prayed for a few minutes ago to come to
[33:14] you from the grandparents therefore if
[33:16] she fell down
[33:18] and upon the child i said but when the
[33:20] abstract has come
[33:22] it struck off omitted everything
[33:26] i'm uh abstract foreign
[33:31] amen and it sure is the spirit that
[33:34] raised christ from the dead i have an
[33:36] abstract need
[33:38] that i'm part of that body with the
[33:41] abstract of the holy ghost making that
[33:43] body of word lit up just exactly like it
[33:46] did in him
[33:47] let's be prominent right there the
[33:49] abstract
[33:50] call my sins are struck out all your
[33:53] sins are struck
[33:54] by the blood of jesus christ and the
[33:56] holy ghost has come as an
[33:58] abstract to the title deed that god give
[34:02] me by grace by foreign
[34:04] amen oh my what scared us
[34:07] no wonder he said fear not anything he
[34:10] that was dead
[34:11] and alive again and i'm alive
[34:12] forevermore had the keys of death and
[34:14] hell
[34:15] don't worry about nothing even if he
[34:17] would hurt you
[34:19] beautiful let's go right quick now the
[34:21] abstract title
[34:23] the death is settled everything against
[34:26] it has been struck off
[34:29] glory i may act silly but i feel good
[34:33] oh an abstract deed do you realize what
[34:36] that means
[34:38] you realize what that means brother
[34:40] there's nothing you can take it away
[34:41] from me
[34:43] amen i am a holder hey man
[34:46] what a why why i have now cashed
[34:50] in on my beneficiary of his death burial
[34:54] and resurrection
[34:56] he become me that i might become him now
[34:59] he became a sinner that i might become a
[35:00] son
[35:02] amen holy abstract deeds
[35:06] for these signs shall follow them that
[35:08] believe
[35:10] the abstract deeds now quickly before it
[35:13] got 15 minutes forward
[35:14] let us now notice quickly the quickening
[35:17] of the spirit
[35:18] i'm going to show you some signs so
[35:20] you'll understand look now
[35:22] watch what this quickening power
[35:26] was my subject as the sun has raised up
[35:29] look how done on them at pentecost what
[35:32] it did to them
[35:33] what that quickening power did to them
[35:37] it's quicker than now let's notice what
[35:40] it did
[35:41] on stephen stephens is full of
[35:44] quickening power wasn't that right
[35:46] see he was full of quickening power it
[35:48] didn't make him scared he said you
[35:50] stiffness uncircumcised the heart and
[35:51] ears
[35:52] you always resist the holy ghost like
[35:53] your father's destroy you
[35:56] which one of the prophets has chosen for
[35:58] the coming of the just one in your
[35:59] father's stone
[36:00] oh my done something to him
[36:03] sure he is full of questioning power and
[36:06] they said we'll get rid of that guy
[36:07] and when he died just stone him in the
[36:10] torah
[36:14] i see the heavens open
[36:17] christian power was working i see the
[36:20] heavens open and jesus standing at the
[36:22] right hand of god
[36:23] that's what quickly power done for
[36:25] stephen
[36:26] notice another fellow had just quickly
[36:29] power his name is philip
[36:32] he was so full of quickly power just
[36:33] have a great big meeting down in samara
[36:35] devils is being cast out people's
[36:37] baptized the name of jesus christ
[36:38] that's had a real meeting and the spirit
[36:41] spoke to him
[36:42] oh the the dynamics come down
[36:46] and it said leave this revival but while
[36:48] the minister said don't make any
[36:49] difference
[36:51] he's full of quickly power he had the
[36:54] gasoline
[36:55] and the dynamic was falling upon him
[36:58] they go out into the desert and he found
[37:02] a eunuch there
[37:03] and baptized him in the name of jesus
[37:05] christ one man who took the message down
[37:07] to ethiopia is that right
[37:08] and he obeyed god and old penis to god
[37:12] if you've never been baptized in the
[37:14] name of jesus christ do it and watch
[37:15] your britney power pick your faith
[37:18] when stephen's done this great thing or
[37:20] not speaking of the
[37:21] done this great thing to leave that
[37:22] great revival and obey the commandments
[37:25] of god
[37:27] on his fulfillment about baptizing this
[37:30] eunuch in obedience to god he was so
[37:32] full of cleansing power to call him away
[37:40] if this spirit that raised up jesus from
[37:43] the dead
[37:44] it quick and fill up so he wasn't seen
[37:46] for maybe 150 miles or somewhere else or
[37:48] another country
[37:50] it's quick in this mortal body how did
[37:52] it go full of equipment
[37:54] oh church of the living god we take that
[37:57] around your own little sugar tits that
[37:58] we're
[37:58] nursing around here today we've got to
[38:00] be full and played up with quickly power
[38:03] until the quickening of the holy ghost
[38:06] we got to be caught away someday in that
[38:07] rapture
[38:11] amen
[38:14] oh my excuse that expression
[38:17] i think about a mother that makes those
[38:18] little factories too for the baby some
[38:20] of you old man is remember
[38:21] the little baby gets a squirrel and take
[38:23] some coffee grounds and some sugar
[38:24] wraps up in the sack let him suck on it
[38:26] just a pacifier
[38:28] there's no strength in that but kitty a
[38:30] little caffeine in there and stuff a
[38:32] little sweetness to make it far down
[38:33] it's getting caffeine
[38:35] we're tired of that stuff is that get
[38:37] back your egos back to the word of god
[38:40] be barely nothing can hurt your feelings
[38:42] you're free
[38:43] from all the scandal of man whatever
[38:45] anybody says against you
[38:46] that just brings more quickening power
[38:50] caught away
[38:51] into the heavenlies the eagle is done
[38:53] through above the chicken
[38:55] way up there in the heavenly places in
[38:56] christ jesus
[38:58] oh it was owned philip that quickening
[39:01] caught him away
[39:02] let's take another man there was a man
[39:04] by the name of enoch
[39:06] and he had walked with every word of god
[39:09] for about 500 years
[39:11] he had a testimony that our heaven one
[39:13] time failed his word
[39:15] he got so full of the quickening power
[39:18] when the dynamics hit him on that
[39:19] mechanic
[39:20] he didn't even have to die he just took
[39:22] it apart just started walking himself
[39:24] like philip he got support quick and
[39:25] power instead of going over
[39:27] to the gates and going to another place
[39:28] where they found him up in the upper
[39:30] coast is there instead of that way he
[39:31] was like well i said i'm an old man
[39:32] anyhow i just got so much quicker
[39:34] walk out here that's the same quickly
[39:37] power that we have right now
[39:39] i think it will quicken your mortal body
[39:42] isn't that right it's the quickening
[39:44] powers edict was that perfect testimony
[39:46] that everything god told me to do i did
[39:49] it everything that i've seen he said for
[39:51] me to do i've done it
[39:52] and become so full of dynamics or or
[39:55] mechanics
[39:56] until when the quickening power stuck in
[39:58] the mechanics it affected him right up
[40:00] he walked on out of the earth into
[40:01] heaven now
[40:04] now i notice on elijah
[40:07] after he looks elijah that great prophet
[40:10] man and his
[40:11] excuses brother and sister in that day
[40:15] he had busted them painted face women
[40:18] then jesse bell and they had
[40:21] and stood until and nobody looked like
[40:24] stood with me
[40:25] and he rebuked and desired and stood out
[40:28] there and
[40:28] god is taking care of me and helped him
[40:30] in every place you know the old fella
[40:32] got tired one day
[40:34] he said you know so i just can't go as
[40:37] far as it's going
[40:38] i guess it's 90 years old real lord
[40:40] walked around there
[40:41] and he was so full of quick and tired
[40:43] you know what he looked across
[40:44] yards oh god
[40:48] i can almost see the other side against
[40:50] you
[40:51] for the quickening power until he seen a
[40:53] chair hooked over there
[40:55] some horses the fire chair the fire
[40:58] hooked to some tree over there
[40:59] he just walked across the river and went
[41:01] home
[41:03] without even dying the quickness power
[41:05] set
[41:06] calls the chairs to come down from
[41:07] heaven and take him up
[41:10] being put off his coat and throw it back
[41:11] for elijah
[41:13] that's right now then that thought
[41:16] picked up that robe the type of the
[41:17] church
[41:19] picked up that role now
[41:22] he's done twice a miracle which is a
[41:25] type of christ in the church
[41:28] elijah done four he done eight see now
[41:31] he was
[41:31] he was double the power because he asked
[41:33] for it greater things than this that i
[41:35] do sure you do
[41:36] see but he was so full of quickening
[41:38] power
[41:39] and everything so he done all these
[41:41] double what elijah done
[41:42] more than he did and noticed he lived a
[41:45] life on up to about 80 or 90 years old
[41:47] he got old
[41:49] and he he died he died
[41:54] they took him out and buried no that
[41:57] quickly bar didn't leave me
[42:00] many many years after that when the
[42:03] flesh had all rotted off his bone
[42:05] he was laying in a tube and they were
[42:08] packing the dead man one day and they
[42:09] saw the enemy
[42:10] and they just throw this man on top of
[42:12] elijah's motion so much quicken power on
[42:14] those folks to a man
[42:28] rested over that dirt hallelujah

[44:36] notice moses is full of that quickening
[44:38] power
[44:39] fuzzy is the prophet who the word came
[44:42] to he was part of the word he was the
[44:43] word of that day is that right
[44:45] and after he was dead 800 years
[44:49] mount transfiguration there is still but
[44:51] they're alive
[44:52] that right they're quickly powered death
[44:55] don't never take it away
[44:57] no no i'll raise it up again the angels
[45:00] come bearing down in the valley
[45:02] he had been rotten and gone his bones
[45:04] was gone and everything else but the
[45:05] quickening power was still there
[45:07] they quickened him and brought him up
[45:09] and there he was standing so she says
[45:11] that right brother branham
[45:12] after 800 years old month if you'd read
[45:15] matthew i got a scripture matthew 27 51
[45:17] you just write part down
[45:20] when all goes back there that believed
[45:23] that he would come
[45:24] the bible said here after he come they
[45:27] were sleeping in the ground
[45:29] quickly powers up on and they were part
[45:31] of him
[45:32] than satan they were part of him because
[45:35] they believed on him potentially
[45:37] they had that life through the sacrifice
[45:39] of a sheep
[45:41] of propitiation which could never bring
[45:43] spirit of sheep back up on the man
[45:45] how about now is the spirit of the man
[45:46] got himself up on this earth
[45:49] how much more quickly power do we have
[45:51] but through
[45:52] the perpetuation our sin was offered a
[45:55] land
[45:55] and type what we have is not the type
[45:59] that's the anatype
[46:01] what are we scared about and those
[46:04] fellows who only had a tight
[46:06] party to his resurrection and went down
[46:09] into the grave with it
[46:10] a job back there under his great
[46:14] stream ah everything took away from him
[46:16] the devil said let me have him i'll make
[46:18] him curse you to your face
[46:20] and then he broke three supposed to take
[46:21] his life and he did
[46:23] he all but take his life and his wife
[46:26] even turned against
[46:27] better breath had become strange to him
[46:29] in other words you should have nothing
[46:30] to do with him she doesn't
[46:32] seem to love him anymore just pushed him
[46:33] away job you're miserable
[46:35] watching his curse god died said you
[46:37] talk like a foolish one
[46:40] he held right to what he had now he's a
[46:42] prophet he said
[46:43] i am not a sinner i have
[46:47] offered the provided sacrifice
[46:50] amen he knew where he was standing
[46:53] he was on the word no matter what the
[46:55] other said is right there at the word
[46:57] then that great tremendous hour says you
[46:59] speak like a food
[47:01] you said the lord gave the lord taken
[47:03] away while blessed be the name of the
[47:05] lord

[47:07] anything i'll come here naked i'll go
[47:09] out the same way blessed be the name of
[47:11] the lord

[47:14] dead his poverty stricken
[47:16] us friends all turned against these
[47:17] church members everything else scraping
[47:19] himself with a
[47:20] what a miserable wretch nobody's ever
[47:22] make that yeah
[47:25] he was an eagle um you can't keep the
[47:28] film over his eyes all the time
[47:31] all it was standing on that word what
[47:34] happened
[47:35] the sky sealed back the thunders began
[47:38] to roar
[47:39] the lightning began to flash and job
[47:41] looked up and saw the vision said i know
[47:43] my redeemer
[47:45] and the last days he'll stand up on this
[47:47] earth and go away from the skin worms

[48:41] 51 said after he is resurrected from the
[48:45] dead
[48:45] that's the old testament
[48:49] many of those just left in the dusty
[48:51] earth come
[48:52] up out here and entered into the city
[48:56] and appeared to me
[48:57] that quickening tower still on the bones
[49:00] of elijah when there was no more bones
[49:03] still on job when he was on the spoon
[49:04] for the dust left of his body but the
[49:06] quickly power was still there
[49:09] if this spirit that raised up jesus from
[49:12] the dead
[49:12] dwelling he'll also quicken your mortal
[49:15] body don't just quickly now
[49:17] say well we're starting back you live in
[49:19] a better time now
[49:20] if you all i see your putting on some
[49:21] scriptures or i put down first
[49:23] thessalonians 4 16
[49:25] notice how beautiful
[49:28] see in the saints
[49:33] then that sleep in christ will god bring
[49:35] with me
[49:36] see faith in the grave resting like
[49:39] elijah was
[49:41] some like elisha was see
[49:44] some of them be christians some will be
[49:46] taken some will be in the grace
[49:48] they will go with it the trumpet of god
[49:50] shall sound
[49:52] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[49:55] and we which arrive and remaining
[49:57] shall be caught up together with them to
[49:59] meet the lord in the air
[50:01] the quickly power on the living the
[50:02] quicken power on the dead

[50:07] presented in both of these prophets
[50:09] look at their names are almost the same
[50:12] elisha elijah
[50:17] see the pride in the group
[50:24] one of them is mr jesus jesus
[50:28] almost the same between them
[50:33] he and she elijah and look cots
[50:36] represent here
[50:37] now elisha was taken up in the rapture
[50:40] represents the church or elijah
[50:44] and elisha rested until the resurrection
[50:48] see it's just like a bird needs two
[50:50] wings to balance itself
[50:53] the church is represented right there in
[50:54] those two prophets
[50:56] where we which alive and remain to the
[50:57] coming lord shall not hinder them which
[50:59] our sins
[51:00] for the trumpet of god shall sound both
[51:02] wings shall come together
[51:03] and we will fly away fly away because

[53:09] john the revelator was still full of
[53:10] quickly power that stood up and seen the
[53:12] end from the beginning
[53:14] isaiah was full of quickly power and
[53:15] stood up and seen the millennium and all
[53:18] quickening power he had the spirit that
[53:20] raised up christ from the dead dwelling
[53:22] you
[53:22] they were quick in your mighty bond
[53:24] mortal body remember
[53:25] the quickness power look what we see in
[53:27] this day the quickly power has come to
[53:29] us
[53:30] to open the seven seals
[53:33] what was that the intelligence of a man
[53:35] no the quickening power of god
[53:38] the quickening power of god foretold
[53:40] this would take place
[53:42] the quickening power of god made the
[53:43] world testify to it it's the truth
[53:45] the angel of the lord what told you was
[53:47] around that killer fight
[53:49] quickening power let the world testify
[53:51] that it's the truth
[53:52] and then that they didn't know what it
[53:53] was and when you just looked this way
[53:55] and it's our lord of medicine
[53:57] he is the one who opened those seals he
[53:59] is so sealed
[54:00] or the whole word of god is christ
[54:04] and christ is the field that was opened
[54:06] what is opening us
[54:07] that revealing christ and the very seven
[54:10] angels which represented the seven
[54:12] churches
[54:12] all completed and we couldn't even see
[54:15] it they didn't they took the picture
[54:18] and there he is senator supreme judge
[54:22] showing that he's alpha and omega
[54:25] the beginning and the end what
[54:27] identification
[54:29] quaking power get back to us quickening
[54:32] power
[54:32] let's just see is coming creeping power
[54:34] stretches from death to life
[54:36] quickly power gives discernment to know
[54:38] what's wrong with him what to do
[54:40] what you have done and what you ought
[54:41] not have done what you should have done
[54:43] and what you will be
[54:44] greasing power all these things our lord
[54:47] jesus is so full of quickly power
[54:49] he was all of it together he's so full
[54:52] of quickly power he said this
[54:54] you destroy this body and i'll raise it
[54:56] up in three days
[54:58] talk about confidence and quitting power
[55:02] destroy this body and i'll wear this
[55:04] temple and i'll bring it up in three
[55:05] days
[55:06] why why'd he say that he knew that it
[55:08] was written of him
[55:11] see it is written here by the word of
[55:13] god which could not fail
[55:15] the word said i will not suffer my holy
[55:18] one
[55:19] to see corruption neither will i leave
[55:21] his soul in hell
[55:23] and he knows that quickness power would
[55:25] raise him up that there would be
[55:27] one cell corrupted he said you destroy
[55:30] this temple i'll bring it back again in
[55:31] three days
[55:32] why it was prophecy
[55:36] the word of god and prophecy if it's
[55:39] true word of god
[55:40] cannot fail and the same prophecy
[55:43] and word of god that they raised him up
[55:46] says that we are already raised with him
[55:51] don't worry said fear not
[55:55] and it is written that the spirit that
[55:58] is now within him now in us
[56:01] also quickens our moral bodies here on
[56:04] friends
[56:05] the s-o-n is up the sun is up no
[56:09] now look at transfiguration with
[56:11] everyone represented there
[56:13] there was the living thing that raptured
[56:15] that was elijah
[56:16] then in there and there stood moses the
[56:19] dead saints
[56:20] referee also pulled them ahead quickly
[56:22] power whether one died and the other
[56:23] didn't die they're all there
[56:25] notice oh look what we're now seeing in
[56:29] these last days
[56:30] the same thing as he promised john 14
[56:32] 12. now look
[56:35] servant people say you claim to have
[56:37] power no no
[56:38] we're just like them at mount
[56:40] transfiguration see certainly we do not
[56:42] claim
[56:42] power but we like like they was on the
[56:46] mount transfiguration
[56:48] they wasn't saying more to say seriously
[56:50] i am the disciples they should i am
[56:52] to i am you know what happened notice
[56:55] they seen jesus glorified that's all
[56:58] they want to see represented
[57:00] jesus glorified and so is it today we
[57:03] don't try to be some big person
[57:06] we don't care what people say about us
[57:09] our name ain't nothing
[57:10] it's his name our life is nothing it's
[57:13] his life
[57:14] it's his power not our power and there's
[57:17] only one thing that we love to do is see
[57:19] him glorified
[57:20] and how can he be when he's glorified in
[57:22] us
[57:23] by his resurrection it's in us we see
[57:26] him represented again as he was
[57:29] today did you get that i think
[57:32] our desire is not to be glorified our
[57:35] desire
[57:36] is not some big name partners are it's
[57:38] not bruce some church or make more than
[57:40] a sunday school
[57:41] or try to bring in hog tithes push in
[57:44] offer
[57:44] a picnic party or bring stars buttons or
[57:47] something else like that that's not our
[57:48] design
[57:49] our desire is to see him glorify
[57:54] glory by what not with self-pride but in
[57:56] us
[57:57] our lives to prove he is alive and
[57:59] living in us
[58:00] if i can get myself out of the way so
[58:03] when william branham not even thought of
[58:04] and you not even thought him so we can
[58:06] see
[58:06] jesus glorified among us see him
[58:09] that's our desire that's the quick gives
[58:12] us the quickening of us
[58:13] and it gives us joy to know that we are
[58:15] with him
[58:16] both flesh and bone of him being the
[58:19] bride
[58:20] of him and seeing his same vindicated
[58:23] methods proving in us that he
[58:26] is now risen from the dead
[58:30] no wonder he said fear or not first now
[58:33] notice we are redeemed by him
[58:36] and now risen with him that's what
[58:39] easter means to
[58:40] the people risen with him notice
[58:44] now we have his spirit in us the
[58:47] abstract deed fully paid
[58:51] you don't say well i hope i make it
[58:53] you've already made it
[58:55] right i will make it up already
[58:57] honorably he made it for me
[59:00] not me him well
[59:09] i just want to see him manifest it how
[59:10] can you do it calm down no he's in you
[59:14] he's in you well then lord if i get
[59:16] myself out of the way you can manifest
[59:17] myself how can you do it
[59:19] because you are deemed itself all that
[59:21] the father has given me will come
[59:24] notice the glory with all that evidence
[59:27] correctly witness now this point
[59:29] oh i think of that song on that
[59:31] resurrection morning

[1:00:10] but he broke the steel and revealed the
[1:00:12] secret and now god by his holy spirit

[1:00:58] new creature
[1:00:58] he is freaking in power the sun's up

[1:01:08] fisherman a fellow come out cardinal
[1:01:10] fisherman's taking fishing out on the
[1:01:11] west coast

[1:03:39] we're baptized there's a pool here full
[1:03:42] of water

[1:04:11] ever been taught by creeds and
[1:04:13] denominations which is contrary to the
[1:04:14] word

[1:04:17] of god and you mean it in your heart
[1:04:20] watch what that baptism of water will do
[1:04:21] to you this morning repent every one of

[1:11:38] my hands
[1:11:39] upon these handkerchiefs that may god
[1:11:43] who quickened jesus christ and brought
[1:11:45] him from the dead and that spirit that
[1:11:47] raised him up from the dead be dwelling
[1:11:49] in our body
[1:11:50] the spirit that was up on the body of
[1:11:53] elijah
[1:11:54] that you're being dead and nothing but
[1:11:56] bones it had quickness power in it
[1:11:58] the hands of the apostles had quickly
[1:12:00] powering us
[1:12:01] the minds of the apostles the sight of
[1:12:04] the apostles the
[1:12:05] the tongues of the believers all had
[1:12:07] quickening powers
[1:12:08] now may that quickly power as i lay this
[1:12:10] word upon them in my hands to represent
[1:12:14] a professor by grace of that quickness
[1:12:17] power
[1:12:18] make quicken every one of these sick
[1:12:19] bodies and they be made
[1:12:21] hold again through jesus christ's name
[1:12:24] may it not only for these packages
[1:12:26] but for those people out there in the
[1:12:27] audience everyone that suffers
[1:12:29] those little children elderly people
[1:12:31] whatever they are maybe that quickening
[1:12:33] power
[1:12:34] quicken them right now in jesus name
[1:12:37] amen now how many got quickening power
[1:12:41] i'll lay your hands up on one another
[1:12:45] if that quickly powers to you now
[1:12:47] there's only one thing to keep it from
[1:12:48] henry
[1:12:49] that's your unbelief a woman touched his
[1:12:52] garment was made whole
[1:12:54] a roman soldier spit his face and went
[1:12:57] to hell
[1:12:58] so it depends on where you at do you
[1:13:00] believe it
[1:13:01] do you believe it now i want you to bow
[1:13:04] your head and pray for one another
[1:13:06] just just pray right out just say lord
[1:13:08] this person
[1:13:09] just pray for one another dear god
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:14] we do this in the name of jesus christ
[1:13:17] the only names given among man
[1:13:20] whereby that we can be saved for him
[1:13:24] these people who are fellow citizens
[1:13:28] of the kingdom are professor of
[1:13:30] lightning power
[1:13:32] quicken it to them or just now may the
[1:13:34] spirit
[1:13:35] go from eagle to eagle
[1:13:39] from word to earth to the fullness of
[1:13:41] jesus christ be made manifest
[1:13:44] that each of the bodies for physical
[1:13:48] spiritual or any need they are needed
[1:13:52] as we lay our hands upon one another in
[1:13:55] jesus christ
[1:14:01] i wanted to play it all the way to the
[1:14:03] end because it's nice to hear it all way
[1:14:04] through the end but i also love that
[1:14:05] prayer at the end
[1:14:07] brother branham admonished us all the
[1:14:08] way through this message that the
[1:14:10] quickening power is in the believer
[1:14:12] the same spirit that raised jesus christ
[1:14:14] from the dead if it be in you it'll
[1:14:16] quicken your mortal body
[1:14:17] and brother branham doesn't end with a
[1:14:18] prayer line he ends with the believers
[1:14:20] laying hands on one another
[1:14:22] because this has to come into
[1:14:23] manifestation it's not just something he
[1:14:25] preaches something he believed and he
[1:14:27] was trying to get the people
[1:14:28] to recognize that you can lay hands on
[1:14:30] one another
[1:14:31] and the same thing's true today it
[1:14:34] hasn't diminished one on
[1:14:37] man let's go into our questions and look
[1:14:39] at those first and then i want to
[1:14:41] look at a few other comments first
[1:14:44] question
[1:14:44] what three steps must you take to walk
[1:14:46] the highway to the doors of heaven
[1:14:49] let's go to paragraph 2 33
[1:14:52] on page 30. page 30 paragraph
[1:14:56] 233 everyone said i remember one time
[1:15:00] when i first started preaching many
[1:15:01] years ago
[1:15:02] we was living right up here on the road
[1:15:04] right just above here i was preaching
[1:15:06] right here at the church
[1:15:07] and she dreamed to dream he's speaking
[1:15:08] of his mother that i was standing here
[1:15:10] by the side of three steps
[1:15:12] and i was standing preaching to
[1:15:13] everybody that they must walk up these
[1:15:15] three steps before they hit the highway
[1:15:17] and on the highway is a little pearly
[1:15:18] like white line run right
[1:15:20] through the doors of heaven to the
[1:15:21] pearly gate and that pearly
[1:15:24] that burley had been stretched out to
[1:15:26] the top of this or that pearl had been
[1:15:28] stretched out to the top of these steps
[1:15:30] if that ain't my message exactly today
[1:15:32] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:15:35] holy ghost
[1:15:36] and i was saying that a person was to
[1:15:37] come by these three steps
[1:15:39] to be able to walk that highway there
[1:15:42] was a lady come by now you know what
[1:15:43] kind of shoes people wore
[1:15:45] 35 years ago there was a lady come by
[1:15:47] and on a great big pair of like they
[1:15:49] wear today spike heeled shoes and
[1:15:51] she come by and and i said wait a minute
[1:15:54] sister you can't walk that highway with
[1:15:55] that
[1:15:56] said you can't do that she said ah
[1:15:59] she said look around at the rest at the
[1:16:01] rest of the women said don't believe him
[1:16:03] he's a madman see
[1:16:04] don't believe him i'll show you i can be
[1:16:06] justified sanctified and filled with the
[1:16:08] holy ghost
[1:16:08] and still walk that she i just let her
[1:16:12] go
[1:16:12] couldn't do no more about it couldn't
[1:16:13] stop her and she jumped up on the
[1:16:15] highway
[1:16:16] and she looked back at the sisters at
[1:16:18] the sister and said see i told you
[1:16:20] she started to run up and she i and you
[1:16:23] know as the bible said in isaiah the
[1:16:25] fifth chapter
[1:16:26] that they would have outstretched next
[1:16:27] they have to they're pitched over
[1:16:30] they have to to keep their balance when
[1:16:32] the high heels pitched him forward i
[1:16:34] remember brother lonnie explaining this
[1:16:35] with a diagram years ago
[1:16:37] the reason that the high heel shoes are
[1:16:38] so immoral because it pushes a woman off
[1:16:41] her center of gravity pushes her forward
[1:16:43] and she has to arch her back when she
[1:16:46] arch her back she augments her breasts
[1:16:49] so the whole thing is a perversion when
[1:16:52] she does that when she arches her back
[1:16:53] she also
[1:16:54] augments her backside and augments her
[1:16:56] breast and it all
[1:16:58] is just to show off the figure of a
[1:17:00] woman
[1:17:02] that's why you know whether they're fat
[1:17:05] or whether they're skinny
[1:17:06] it's not the fat or the skinny it's how
[1:17:09] high they are
[1:17:10] amen and brother brendon brings this
[1:17:12] right out of the scripture he's not just
[1:17:14] saying this for not he brings it right
[1:17:16] out of isaiah the fifth chapter
[1:17:18] and they would have outstretched next
[1:17:19] they have to they
[1:17:21] they're pitched oversea mincing they
[1:17:23] have to have to twist
[1:17:24] mincing as they go making a tinkling
[1:17:27] with their heels see the daughters of
[1:17:28] zion in the last day
[1:17:30] and she started up that highway just as
[1:17:31] hard as she could run
[1:17:33] and after a while the road got narrower
[1:17:35] and narrower she started reeling mincing
[1:17:37] like that and off she went
[1:17:39] and mother said the horriblest screams
[1:17:41] that i ever heard in my life was that
[1:17:42] woman
[1:17:43] falling into those flames and smoke
[1:17:45] going down down like that said i turned
[1:17:47] around and said see
[1:17:48] she just obeyed everything but one word
[1:17:50] see everything but one word
[1:17:52] sure pentecostal women can be saved
[1:17:55] sanctified and filled with the holy
[1:17:56] ghost and then fail
[1:17:58] absolutely man shall not live by bread
[1:18:00] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:18:02] see
[1:18:03] and she failed it and as i said see she
[1:18:06] would have went
[1:18:07] on in all right but see she failed to
[1:18:09] listen
[1:18:10] telling her what was ahead and he's
[1:18:12] wrote the gospel by the disciples
[1:18:13] apostles and doctrine the apostles and
[1:18:15] prophets and so forth
[1:18:16] and they won't listen i wanted to bring
[1:18:19] this out for a particular reason
[1:18:21] first brother brandon said that was his
[1:18:22] ministry just exactly justification
[1:18:24] sanctification baptism holy ghost
[1:18:26] but but in in the way that he's taking
[1:18:29] this dream and he's typing it with his
[1:18:31] ministry
[1:18:31] you realize that justification
[1:18:33] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:18:35] ghost
[1:18:35] got you on the highway
[1:18:39] that third step wasn't the finish line
[1:18:41] amen brother baby said the baptism holy
[1:18:43] ghost is the new birth that's just the
[1:18:44] start you just begin and then you grow
[1:18:46] up
[1:18:46] amen so now now that that third step
[1:18:49] gets you on the highway where you walk
[1:18:51] that pearly line all the way to heaven's
[1:18:53] doors
[1:18:54] and so that's where brother branham had
[1:18:56] such an issue with the pentecostals
[1:18:58] because they stopped
[1:18:59] amen but you had to walk all the way and
[1:19:01] then brother branham also says here
[1:19:03] that you know sure a pentecostal woman
[1:19:05] can be saved sanctified and filled with
[1:19:07] the holy ghost and then
[1:19:08] fail brother branham made this really
[1:19:10] really clear and anointed ones at the
[1:19:12] end time
[1:19:12] he says you can have the baptism holy
[1:19:14] ghost on your spirit not your soul
[1:19:16] on your spirit every day of your life
[1:19:18] and die and go to hell
[1:19:19] amen and that's what brother branham was
[1:19:21] seeing there was a baptism that had
[1:19:23] fallen amen and the tares were being
[1:19:25] blessed along with the wheat but it
[1:19:26] wasn't going
[1:19:27] deep in the tares because there was no
[1:19:28] seed there for it to strike
[1:19:30] amen but it was just the baptism of the
[1:19:32] holy ghost but i want to pick this up
[1:19:34] for the true baptism of the holy
[1:19:36] ghost that settles us in in paragraph
[1:19:38] 231 back on page 30.
[1:19:41] just before he gets to the story he
[1:19:43] tells this story for a reason
[1:19:45] and i'm going to back up and show you in
[1:19:47] paragraph 231
[1:19:49] it says now look how can you say that
[1:19:51] that spirit dwells in you
[1:19:52] though you've done everything that you
[1:19:54] thought was right here is your evidence
[1:19:56] whether you got it or not
[1:19:57] if the spirit that was in christ in you
[1:20:00] it also quickens you to the word for he
[1:20:03] is the word
[1:20:04] and if it contrary quickens you away
[1:20:05] from the word then it isn't the spirit
[1:20:07] of christ
[1:20:09] care what you've done until that moves
[1:20:11] you in the word my sheep hear my voice
[1:20:13] and they shall live by every word every
[1:20:15] word i was talking on the other day
[1:20:18] so you see the baptism in the soul that
[1:20:21] brings a new birth will take you in line
[1:20:22] with
[1:20:23] every word this pentecostal woman that
[1:20:25] he saw that says i can come
[1:20:26] justification sanctification baptist
[1:20:28] holy ghost
[1:20:28] and walk that but ignoring isaiah
[1:20:30] chapter 5 and ignoring the commandment
[1:20:32] of the word
[1:20:33] amen it shows that she didn't have the
[1:20:35] real thing in the soul
[1:20:36] because it would have kept her in line
[1:20:38] with the word all the way through
[1:20:41] and for us who received amen received
[1:20:43] the real baptist holy ghost in the soul
[1:20:45] amen with a genuine new birth it'll keep
[1:20:47] you all the way
[1:20:48] friends it'll keep you lined up with the
[1:20:50] word and don't worry if you get off step
[1:20:54] his rod in this staff they comfort my
[1:20:56] comfort me
[1:20:57] he'll keep us in line the next question
[1:21:01] question number two
[1:21:03] what is the abstract to the title deed
[1:21:05] let's go to paragraph 246 on page 32.
[1:21:10] what is the abstract to the title deed
[1:21:14] towards the bottom of the page paragraph
[1:21:15] 246 like the pentecostal experience
[1:21:18] today and the coming of the holy ghost
[1:21:20] in this last days
[1:21:21] as promised is like the abstract to a
[1:21:23] title deed see
[1:21:25] now you can get a title sure see you can
[1:21:28] get a title to a place but that still
[1:21:29] don't say it's yours no sir
[1:21:31] somebody way back yonder could come in
[1:21:33] and put a claim on it
[1:21:34] but when you get an abstract that shows
[1:21:36] that everything that's ever against it
[1:21:38] is struck off
[1:21:39] plumb back from the foundation is that
[1:21:42] right
[1:21:43] oh praise god you can claim to be a
[1:21:46] christian but the devil he may want to
[1:21:47] put a claim on that also
[1:21:49] amen but the abstract will take it back
[1:21:51] further all the way back to the
[1:21:52] foundation
[1:21:53] and prove everything is stricken off
[1:21:56] paragraph 248 and when a man has said
[1:21:58] that he believes the word
[1:22:00] and then when the holy spirit comes it
[1:22:02] is the abstract to the title deed
[1:22:05] that that gives you permission when you
[1:22:07] have that abstract that every bit of
[1:22:08] that belongs to you
[1:22:10] and everything is on it belongs to you
[1:22:12] amen and that gives us the abstract when
[1:22:14] the holy ghost comes upon you
[1:22:16] this title deed that god saw back yonder
[1:22:19] for the foundation of the world and put
[1:22:21] it

[1:22:31] ghost come it was the abstract that
[1:22:33] everything against me whether my mother
[1:22:35] done it
[1:22:36] my father done it my grandmother done it
[1:22:38] like the little epileptic child i prayed

[1:22:42] from the grandparents

[1:22:48] it struck off omitted everything i'm an
[1:22:51] abstract

[1:22:54] spirit that raised christ from the dead
[1:22:56] i have an abstract deed that i'm part of
[1:22:58] that body
[1:22:59] with the abstract of the holy ghost
[1:23:01] making that body of the word
[1:23:02] live out just exactly like it did in him
[1:23:05] as he promised in the last day
[1:23:07] the abstract all my sins are struck out
[1:23:10] all your sins are struck out by the
[1:23:12] blood of jesus christ
[1:23:13] and the holy ghost is come as an
[1:23:15] abstract to the title deed
[1:23:17] that god give me by grace by
[1:23:19] foreknowledge oh my
[1:23:21] what are you scared about no wonder he
[1:23:23] said fear not i am he
[1:23:25] that was dead and alive again and i'm
[1:23:27] alive forevermore and have the keys of

[1:24:42] oh praise be to god what an assurance
[1:24:46] that we have seen in this day
[1:24:50] let's look at par question number three
[1:24:53] what is the opening of the seals let's
[1:24:56] start back at
[1:24:56] paragraph 304 on page 36.
[1:25:01] nope sorry page 38
[1:25:04] nope page 40.
[1:25:08] wow i was way off
[1:25:12] down at the bottom of page 40 let's look
[1:25:14] at 30304 the question is
[1:25:17] what is the opening of the seals i want
[1:25:19] to begin all the way back here at
[1:25:21] paragraph 304
[1:25:22] john the revelator was fill filled full
[1:25:25] of quickening
[1:25:26] power that stood up and seen the end
[1:25:27] from the beginning
[1:25:29] isaiah was full of the quickening power
[1:25:31] and stood up and seen the millennium and
[1:25:33] all
[1:25:33] quickening power and if the spirit that
[1:25:35] raised up christ from the dead dwell in
[1:25:37] you
[1:25:37] it'll quicken your body mortal body
[1:25:40] remember
[1:25:41] the quickening power look what we've
[1:25:43] seen in this day the quickening power
[1:25:45] has come to us
[1:25:46] to open the seven seals what was that
[1:25:49] the intelligence of a man
[1:25:50] no the quickening power of god the
[1:25:53] quickening
[1:25:54] power of god foretold this would take
[1:25:55] place see the quickening power of god
[1:25:57] made the world testify to it it's the
[1:25:59] truth
[1:25:59] the angel of the lord i told you was
[1:26:01] around in the pillar of fire quickening
[1:26:03] power and let the world testify that
[1:26:04] it's the truth
[1:26:06] and in that they didn't know what it was
[1:26:09] and we knew
[1:26:10] just look this way it's our lord up
[1:26:12] there you see
[1:26:13] he is the one who opened those seals he
[1:26:15] is those seals
[1:26:17] for the whole word of god is christ and
[1:26:19] christ is the seals that was opened
[1:26:21] what is the opening of the seals then
[1:26:23] revealing christ
[1:26:26] what is the opening of the seals
[1:26:27] revealing christ i want you to hold on
[1:26:29] to that statement because it gets
[1:26:30] really good what is the opening of the
[1:26:33] seals then revealing christ
[1:26:34] and the very seven angels which
[1:26:36] represented the seven churches all
[1:26:38] completed
[1:26:39] and we couldn't even see it they did
[1:26:41] they took the picture not
[1:26:42] us and here he is standing there supreme
[1:26:45] judge
[1:26:45] showing that he is alpha and omega the
[1:26:47] beginning and the end what
[1:26:49] identification quickening power did that
[1:26:51] to us
[1:26:53] so what is the opening of the seals then
[1:26:55] revealing christ
[1:26:57] let's go all the way back to paragraph
[1:26:59] 12 with something a statement brother
[1:27:01] benham opened with
[1:27:03] and i want to read that in this context
[1:27:06] page two all the way back on page two
[1:27:09] paragraph twelve and so there he spoke
[1:27:12] to me and said the seven seals will be
[1:27:14] open the seven mystery
[1:27:16] sevenfold mystery of the bible that's
[1:27:18] been closed up since the foundation of
[1:27:20] the world will be revealed
[1:27:22] and we yet a humble little group
[1:27:23] compared with all the world
[1:27:25] we've enjoyed these blessings and
[1:27:26] hearing these mysteries marriage divorce
[1:27:28] servants
[1:27:29] all these different questions has been
[1:27:30] completely revealed to us
[1:27:32] not by man but by god himself that's
[1:27:34] opened those seven mysteries
[1:27:36] of what the church was how it was in
[1:27:38] christ at the beginning
[1:27:39] and how it would be revealed in the last
[1:27:41] days
[1:27:44] what is the opening of the seals
[1:27:47] revealing christ
[1:27:48] and brother brenham said these seven
[1:27:50] mysteries would reveal the church
[1:27:52] that she was part of christ from all the
[1:27:54] way in the beginning
[1:27:55] it's part of the mystery laying under
[1:27:57] the seven seals the revelation of christ
[1:27:59] is the revelation of christ both male
[1:28:02] and female so the revelation of the
[1:28:04] church the seven mysteries of the church
[1:28:06] of what she was
[1:28:07] she was always in christ that's part of
[1:28:09] the revelation of the seven seals
[1:28:11] and part of the revelation of christ
[1:28:15] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:28:16] revealed
[1:28:19] are you part of that by his grace
[1:28:22] by his foreknowledge not me and my flesh
[1:28:25] not the
[1:28:26] boy that was born of parents but that
[1:28:28] attribute of god that came from the mind
[1:28:30] of god as part of him and always was
[1:28:32] part of him
[1:28:33] and we believe it by the revelation of
[1:28:36] the seven seals
[1:28:39] praise god that blessed me
[1:28:44] question number four what does the
[1:28:46] breaking of the easter seal in our lives
[1:28:48] reveal let's look at paragraph 325
[1:28:55] paragraph 3
[1:28:56] 25 what does the breaking of the easter
[1:29:00] seal in our lives reveal
[1:29:02] paragraph 3 25 on page 43 you believe
[1:29:05] that
[1:29:06] we shall rise in him we become part of
[1:29:08] him the easter
[1:29:09] the easter the revealed secret of god
[1:29:11] like it was then of life after death
[1:29:14] we are now alive who were once dead in
[1:29:16] sin and trespasses
[1:29:17] the true easter seal has broke death
[1:29:19] from around me
[1:29:20] and i'm alive the easter seal at the
[1:29:23] beginning broke the seal of the roman
[1:29:25] seal
[1:29:25] the easter seal that he was sealed up
[1:29:27] and men when they died was gone but he
[1:29:29] broke the seal and revealed the secret
[1:29:31] and now god by his holy spirit has broke
[1:29:34] the seal from around our lives
[1:29:36] and christ is revealed as he lives in us
[1:29:41] christ is revealed amen what is the the
[1:29:44] the breaking of the seals it's revealing
[1:29:47] christ amen
[1:29:48] and now as god by his holy spirit has
[1:29:50] broke the seal from around our lives
[1:29:52] and christ is revealed as he lives in us
[1:29:55] for now we are quickened
[1:29:56] with him let's go down to paragraph 3 26
[1:30:00] oh aren't you glad i'm so glad way back
[1:30:02] yonder and a little old cold shed one
[1:30:04] morning
[1:30:05] the seals were broken and i raised with
[1:30:07] him a new creature
[1:30:08] his quickening power the sun is up amen
[1:30:12] the sun is up amen praise be to god
[1:30:17] i thank god that he's he by his message
[1:30:19] of this hour and by the revelation
[1:30:21] of the holy ghost he has broken the
[1:30:23] seals from our life
[1:30:25] and revealed what revealed christ in you
[1:30:27] the hope of glory
[1:30:30] there's a few other comments that i just
[1:30:31] want to make before we close
[1:30:33] if we could go back to paragraph 242
[1:30:40] paragraph 242
[1:30:44] on the bottom of page 31.
[1:30:50] i just want to highlight a few things
[1:30:51] brother benham said but remember
[1:30:54] he went there with you in him
[1:30:57] god had never separated the bride from
[1:30:59] the groom yet so when god looked down
[1:31:01] upon the body of christ he saw both male
[1:31:04] and female
[1:31:04] it was all redeemed in that one body
[1:31:07] they are one
[1:31:08] same same word the same word spoke of
[1:31:10] the groom speaks of the bride
[1:31:12] well how can the bride come and fail to
[1:31:13] manifest everything was promised of him
[1:31:16] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[1:31:17] the bride but when he did
[1:31:19] when he when he did everything even to
[1:31:21] proving it by raising himself up from
[1:31:23] the dead afterwards then don't the bride
[1:31:25] have to do the same thing have to be
[1:31:27] exactly what the word said she would be
[1:31:29] in these last days
[1:31:30] don't she have to return through malachi
[1:31:31] 4 don't she have to be manifest like it
[1:31:34] was in the days of sodom
[1:31:35] don't the world have to be just like
[1:31:37] exactly like it is isn't these things
[1:31:39] perfect identification of the word of
[1:31:41] god
[1:31:41] made known to us you were there
[1:31:46] in him that life of god is inside of you
[1:31:50] it was there then amen
[1:31:52] that seed that attribute of god was in
[1:31:54] you now
[1:31:55] it was in there then brother branham
[1:31:57] said that's why
[1:31:59] he said we already he already made us
[1:32:01] pay for our sins when we were with him
[1:32:03] in the calvary
[1:32:05] and that's why brother branham gets gets
[1:32:07] down and he says
[1:32:08] it's not that a will it's not that
[1:32:13] he will or he might he already has
[1:32:16] it's finished amen and when the abstract
[1:32:19] comes when the
[1:32:20] holy ghost comes amen the holy the
[1:32:22] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:32:24] proves that there's nothing against you
[1:32:26] and your title deed is good all the way
[1:32:28] back to the foundation of the world
[1:32:30] all the way back to the land's book of
[1:32:32] life it's the evidence the baptism holy
[1:32:34] ghost is the evidence that your's title
[1:32:36] is secure
[1:32:37] everything's struck against it there's
[1:32:38] nothing that can foul it up there's no
[1:32:41] claim against it
[1:32:42] because it come all the way back from
[1:32:43] the original writing in heaven
[1:32:45] and the lamb's book of life where the
[1:32:47] deed was recorded and it's clear
[1:32:49] from here back there with no
[1:32:52] obstructions what a security that's been
[1:32:55] given to us
[1:32:56] there's no hope so in this friend there
[1:32:58] cannot be a hope
[1:32:59] so if there's a hope so then we've got
[1:33:01] to go back to a fundamental revelation
[1:33:03] and say god
[1:33:04] i need the assurance of the baptism of
[1:33:06] holy ghost to quicken to me the reality
[1:33:08] that my name is written on that lamb's
[1:33:10] book of life
[1:33:11] so that i quit hoping that i'll make it
[1:33:13] we can't hope that we'll make it
[1:33:14] we have to know that we've already made
[1:33:17] it that when he was on calvary
[1:33:19] i that life that's in me now was there
[1:33:21] yeah
[1:33:24] it's secure it's finished amen
[1:33:28] praise god if we're still in the cycle
[1:33:30] of hoping
[1:33:31] and failing and restoring and hoping
[1:33:33] amen we need to say god
[1:33:35] i need a deeper revelation i need an
[1:33:37] assurance that comes from the baptism
[1:33:39] holy ghost
[1:33:40] that i know that i know that i know that
[1:33:42] it's finished for me
[1:33:44] and then i'm secure that's what this
[1:33:47] message has done friends it's given us
[1:33:49] such an assurance
[1:33:51] such a guarantee amen praise god
[1:33:56] let's look at paragraph
[1:33:59] 303 on page 40.
[1:34:08] paragraph 303 on page 40. and one day
[1:34:11] when i was wearing myself
[1:34:13] i said you boy you'd better go ahead
[1:34:15] you're 50 years old if you're going to
[1:34:17] do anything for the lord you better
[1:34:18] hurry up and do it you're getting old
[1:34:20] and there that morning the quickening
[1:34:22] power come and he let me look over the
[1:34:23] curtain
[1:34:24] and i seen all of you over there
[1:34:28] oh he said all that you ever loved and
[1:34:31] all loved you
[1:34:32] they're given to you see i seen them all
[1:34:34] over there like that
[1:34:36] what was it quickening power oh
[1:34:39] praise god amen i hope that brings
[1:34:42] security to your heart
[1:34:45] let's look at paragraph 317 over on page
[1:34:49] 42.
[1:34:54] paragraph 317 on page 42. we're just
[1:34:57] like them at mount transfiguration c
[1:34:59] certainly we do not claim power we like
[1:35:03] they was on the mount transfiguration
[1:35:05] they wasn't saying moses say see who see
[1:35:08] who i
[1:35:08] am the disciples said see who i am see
[1:35:11] who i am
[1:35:11] you know what happened notice they seen
[1:35:14] jesus glorified that's
[1:35:15] all they wanted to see represented jesus
[1:35:18] glorified
[1:35:20] see friends this is a major attitude
[1:35:22] adjustment
[1:35:23] brother branham's bringing the right
[1:35:25] proper correct attitude
[1:35:27] and so is it today we don't try to be
[1:35:29] some big person
[1:35:31] we don't care what people say about us
[1:35:33] our name ain't nothing it's his name
[1:35:35] our life isn't nothing it's his life
[1:35:37] it's his power
[1:35:38] not our power and there is only one
[1:35:40] thing that we love to do is see him
[1:35:42] glorified
[1:35:44] and how can it be when he's glorified in
[1:35:46] us
[1:35:47] by his resurrection that's in us we see
[1:35:50] him represented again as he was today
[1:35:52] did you get that see our desire is not
[1:35:55] to be glorified
[1:35:56] our desire is not some big name our
[1:35:58] desire is not to boost some church or
[1:36:00] make more in sunday school or try to
[1:36:02] bring in
[1:36:02] hogtie push in offer a picnic party or
[1:36:05] bring stars buttons or something else
[1:36:06] like that
[1:36:07] that's not our desire our desire to see
[1:36:10] him glorified glorified what
[1:36:12] not with self-pride but in us our lives
[1:36:15] to prove he is alive
[1:36:16] and living in us if i can get myself out
[1:36:20] of the way so when william branham not
[1:36:22] even thought of
[1:36:23] and you not even thought of till we can
[1:36:25] see jesus glorified among us
[1:36:27] see him that's our desire
[1:36:33] that gives us the quickening power and
[1:36:35] it gives us joy to know that we are
[1:36:37] with him both flesh and bone of him
[1:36:39] being the bride of him and seeing his
[1:36:41] name
[1:36:42] send his same vindicated methods proving
[1:36:44] in us
[1:36:45] that he is now risen from the dead sea
[1:36:47] no wonder he said fear not
[1:36:48] for now notice we are redeemed by him
[1:36:51] and now risen with him that's what
[1:36:53] easter means to the people risen with
[1:36:55] him
[1:36:56] notice now we have his spirit in us the
[1:36:59] abstract deed
[1:37:00] fully paid no you don't say well i hope
[1:37:03] i make it you've already
[1:37:05] made it not i will make it i've already
[1:37:09] made it
[1:37:10] remember friends you can't even say i
[1:37:11] will make it
[1:37:13] you can't even say i will make it that
[1:37:15] day i will be there
[1:37:16] no i i will you already have you're
[1:37:19] already seated in heavenly places in
[1:37:21] christ jesus
[1:37:22] you've already paid for your sins on
[1:37:23] calvary you're just now recognizing it
[1:37:27] but not i will make it i've already
[1:37:30] made it i never made it
[1:37:34] he made it for me see not me
[1:37:38] him well brother bannon they said i
[1:37:40] don't care what they say
[1:37:42] there he made it for me that's all i
[1:37:44] want i'm caring about
[1:37:46] i just i just want to see him manifested
[1:37:49] how can you do it call him down
[1:37:51] no he's in you see he's in you well then
[1:37:54] lord if i can get myself
[1:37:56] out of the way you can manifest myself
[1:38:00] how can you do it because you ordained
[1:38:02] it so
[1:38:02] all that the father has given me will
[1:38:04] come notice
[1:38:05] glory see
[1:38:09] brother branham was the seventh angel
[1:38:13] he was also the fulfillment of the
[1:38:15] prophecy of malachi 4
[1:38:16] that i will send elijah the prophet he
[1:38:19] was
[1:38:20] that manifestation of elijah prophet
[1:38:22] that elijah's spirit was in him
[1:38:24] he was the seventh angel he was the
[1:38:26] seventh church age messenger
[1:38:28] he was a mighty prophet amen and he
[1:38:30] never
[1:38:31] lifted himself up he never got glory for
[1:38:34] himself he did
[1:38:35] nothing but point to christ
[1:38:38] and the truth is we are the bride of
[1:38:40] jesus christ by his doing by his grace
[1:38:42] by his choosing
[1:38:43] not anything we've done ourselves and if
[1:38:44] we can't as the bride
[1:38:46] have the same attitude that prophet had
[1:38:48] with all the manifestations he had
[1:38:50] all the scriptural references he could
[1:38:52] point to his own life
[1:38:53] still he humbled himself and subjected
[1:38:55] himself to christ and was always
[1:38:57] pointing upward to jesus christ if we
[1:38:59] can't have that same attitude then we're
[1:39:01] not as bride
[1:39:02] if it makes us elevated if it makes us
[1:39:04] proud if we talk about we're the bride
[1:39:06] we're the bride
[1:39:07] we are we are his wife and he's the
[1:39:09] great one among us it's jesus christ who
[1:39:11] we want to seek glorify
[1:39:13] we want to see him elevated we want to
[1:39:15] see him glorified
[1:39:16] he will glorify his bride
[1:39:20] but she will not glorify herself
[1:39:24] sometimes i get nervous and bride
[1:39:26] preaching that it's too much
[1:39:27] glorification of the bride and not
[1:39:29] enough glorification of the lord
[1:39:32] god christ himself will lift his bride
[1:39:35] up
[1:39:36] and say here she is then the way he goes
[1:39:39] with her she does
[1:39:40] not have to lift herself all she has to
[1:39:43] do is keep lifting him
[1:39:44] up him
[1:39:48] let that be our attitude friends
[1:39:51] paragraph 346
[1:40:02] paragraph 346 on page 46
[1:40:05] and now see now you are already
[1:40:07] resurrected
[1:40:08] when god raised him up he raised you
[1:40:11] the son is just now on you and now
[1:40:13] you're growing into a blossom of life
[1:40:15] like he was
[1:40:16] to be resurrected completely in the last
[1:40:18] day your potentials you have now
[1:40:21] why do you know your soul changed didn't
[1:40:24] it
[1:40:25] your body come in obedience to it didn't
[1:40:26] it and obedience to what a church
[1:40:28] the word which is the life when you are
[1:40:31] now resurrected from the dead it is
[1:40:33] easter with jesus and i
[1:40:34] it's easter with you and jesus and it's
[1:40:37] easter with you i and jesus
[1:40:39] we are all our jesus you and i we are
[1:40:41] all
[1:40:42] resurrected together
[1:40:45] what a consolation the comment i liked
[1:40:47] in there the sun
[1:40:48] is just now on you and now you're
[1:40:50] growing into a blossom life
[1:40:53] like he was all the potentials are there
[1:40:56] all the the power is there the word is
[1:40:59] there but you're growing
[1:41:01] into a blossom life like he was
[1:41:04] i said lord let me reflect that life
[1:41:07] let's go back to paragraph 333 and i
[1:41:09] want to finish with this
[1:41:13] brother branham asked them to bow their
[1:41:16] heads
[1:41:18] 3 33 and i just want to leave this as a
[1:41:21] thought
[1:41:23] is there any here or many who doesn't
[1:41:25] have this quickening power in you
[1:41:28] i'm not going to ask anyone to raise
[1:41:30] their hands or make any kind of movement
[1:41:32] or acknowledgement but you've heard this
[1:41:34] message we've listened to it today
[1:41:36] and if you don't have that assurance
[1:41:38] where you can say not i hope to make it
[1:41:40] or i will make it you say i've already
[1:41:41] made it
[1:41:42] if you don't have that assurance that
[1:41:43] assurance is available friends
[1:41:47] is there one here or many who doesn't
[1:41:48] have this quickening power and you the
[1:41:50] son has shined a cross
[1:41:51] and you sit in this tabernacle you
[1:41:53] listen to tapes and yet the spirit has
[1:41:55] never quickened you till you could
[1:41:56] follow the word of god
[1:41:57] that you women and you men could obey
[1:41:59] every word and that he's written
[1:42:02] oh that's a dangerous thing what if you
[1:42:04] would be a dead seed no life in you
[1:42:06] but there is something in you that tells
[1:42:08] you i want to rise this morning
[1:42:11] i want to rise from the state i'm in i
[1:42:13] don't want to be just a dead seed
[1:42:15] be left to dirt and drift away i want to
[1:42:17] rise
[1:42:19] you may be in here you may be a young
[1:42:21] person an old person or something in
[1:42:22] between amen
[1:42:24] but if you don't have that assurance
[1:42:26] that quickening power the abstract
[1:42:27] that's come to the title deed to let you
[1:42:29] know everything's struck off
[1:42:30] amen and you may say you're afraid and
[1:42:33] may not have been able to line up to the
[1:42:35] word you've heard the word preached and
[1:42:37] won online but not able to line up to it
[1:42:39] amen brother branham's saying amen what
[1:42:41] you need is the abstract to the title
[1:42:43] deed
[1:42:44] you need the same spirit that raised
[1:42:45] jesus from the dead to quicken your
[1:42:47] mortal body
[1:42:48] and he says but there's something in you
[1:42:50] that tells you
[1:42:51] i want to rise this morning i'm asking
[1:42:54] you is there something in you that says
[1:42:56] i want to rise this morning
[1:42:58] i want this mortal body to be quickened
[1:43:00] by his spirit i want to line to every
[1:43:02] word i want to come full obedience to
[1:43:04] the word
[1:43:04] i want to surrender my life i want to
[1:43:07] die out i don't want my own way i want
[1:43:09] his way i don't want to be glorified i
[1:43:11] want him to be glorified
[1:43:13] i want to surrender i want to give up i
[1:43:15] want to turn over
[1:43:16] i want to rise if that's in you and
[1:43:20] there's something in you
[1:43:21] pulling you that way and there's a
[1:43:23] desire then you can rise friends
[1:43:25] there's a light here the pillar of fire
[1:43:27] is still with the word it hasn't gone
[1:43:29] anywhere
[1:43:29] the light is here the sun is up and it
[1:43:31] will quicken you
[1:43:35] brother says will you raise your hand
[1:43:37] say pray for me brother
[1:43:38] god bless you god bless you my look at
[1:43:40] the hands there is no way at all for an
[1:43:42] altar call
[1:43:43] what we call an altar call people come
[1:43:45] up around the altar i'm not too much on
[1:43:47] any anyhow that was just added to the
[1:43:49] church during the days of the methodist
[1:43:50] revival see
[1:43:52] the bible said as many as believe see
[1:43:54] we're baptized
[1:43:55] there is a pool here full of water
[1:43:57] waiting for any candidate who is ready
[1:43:59] to die
[1:43:59] to themselves there's it friends
[1:44:02] ready for any candidate that's ready to
[1:44:04] die to themselves
[1:44:06] now you might be buried in many times in
[1:44:08] the name of the lord jesus but until
[1:44:10] that seed is life see
[1:44:11] it won't quicken no no baptism of waters
[1:44:14] is like the dew that fell from the
[1:44:15] heavens it can fall upon the seed
[1:44:17] but there's no life there it can't live
[1:44:19] but if that real baptism of waters of
[1:44:22] death to yourself and you're ready to
[1:44:25] die out to everything that you've ever
[1:44:26] been taught by creeds and denominations
[1:44:29] which is contrary to the word and you'll
[1:44:32] walk as a son or daughter of god
[1:44:34] and you mean it in your heart watch what
[1:44:36] that baptism of water will do to you
[1:44:38] this morning
[1:44:39] repent every one of you and be baptized

[1:47:05] through the lips of a prophet
[1:47:07] you made it so manifest and so real and
[1:47:10] brought it so to life out of the bible
