[0:00] maybe I'm saying I'm seeing so much
[0:01] wrong in the churches and I feel like I
[0:03] got to correct it all by myself and
[0:05] straighten it up and there's things in
[0:06] there
[0:07] and all of a sudden he realized what's
[0:10] that to thee follow thou me
[0:13] amen
[0:15] if a thousand go off what's that to you
[0:21] if ten thousand Fall Away what does that
[0:24] matter what about that Brethren what
[0:26] about that brother why can he do this
[0:28] and why can she do that what is that to
[0:30] you follow me
[0:34] what does that matter are you willing to
[0:36] be nailed to the cross are you willing
[0:38] now you've seen it all you've endured it
[0:40] all amen you've you've gone through all
[0:42] kinds of the things that you can go
[0:43] through in the church you've failed
[0:45] yourself you've seen others fail you
[0:47] you've seen all of this strife and
[0:49] contention
[0:52] let's go back to the beginning now
[0:55] I'm still the same Jesus Christ
[0:58] this is still the same message this word
[1:00] has the same power it has the same
[1:02] provision it has the same life
[1:06] but they forget about they
[1:09] but I forget about I
[1:12] let's go back to the beginning
[1:15] I've called you
[1:17] I've called you for a reason I've called
[1:19] you for a purpose you're part of my
[1:21] kingdom I haven't a plan I'm going to
[1:23] use you but you're going to have to be
[1:25] willing to be sacrificed
[1:28] you're going to have to be willing to
[1:30] give your life
[1:31] to follow me
[1:33] and it doesn't matter what happens to
[1:36] anybody else
[1:40] we get so discouraged because did you
[1:42] hear what's happening in this church did
[1:44] you hear what's happening in this family
[1:45] did you see this did you hear that did
[1:47] you hear the decision they made and
[1:49] Leadership did this and I think we
[1:51] should have done this amen and we get so
[1:53] discouraged by those things and all of
[1:55] that what does that matter follow the
[1:58] Lord amen he called us are we happy to
[2:00] be in the message are we happy with the
[2:02] word are we happy that Christ is
[2:04] resurrected and alive he meets the same
[2:06] provision he's the same Christ it's the
[2:08] same message with the same power and the
[2:10] word is being revealed
[2:14] people will make mistakes all around us
[2:16] all the time
[2:18] that's not going to go away
[2:20] it's always been wherever the church was
[2:23] it's always been that way it's going to
[2:25] continue to be that way so what amen why
[2:28] does that why do we let that hinder us
[2:33] follow him
[2:36] amen can we go back to our first love
[2:39] and say Lord
[2:41] I'm discouraged I've been discouraged
[2:44] I've been hurt I've been wounded I've
[2:45] been troubled I failed
[2:48] but oh
[2:50] I want to serve you
[2:52] with the same Vigor with the same life
[2:54] with the same joy that I did from the
[2:57] beginning
