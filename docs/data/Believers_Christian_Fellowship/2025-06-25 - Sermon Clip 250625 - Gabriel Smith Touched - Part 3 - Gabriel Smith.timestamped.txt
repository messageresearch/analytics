[0:00] And that's like what this message does
[0:02] to us. We go thinking that once we stop
[0:04] I remember when I thought, man, when I
[0:06] stop drinking and all drugging, all boy,
[0:08] I'm going to have it all.
[0:10] Nope.
[0:13] You just scratching the surface,
[0:15] brother.
[0:18] Right. And then that word starts coming
[0:21] and it starts doing heart surgery on us.
[0:25] Right. How many of us h have have been
[0:28] in a service and the preaching of the
[0:30] word comes at us so straight that it
[0:32] starts uncovering things in our lives
[0:35] that we didn't even realize
[0:38] was there
[0:41] to the service and that same thing
[0:44] happens. So what I what I what what to
[0:47] me what it means is when that second
[0:49] pool we saw it transition from the first
[0:52] into the second and it unlock something
[0:54] within that sister she didn't know she
[0:57] had.
[1:00] But the beautiful thing is is in that
[1:03] third pool when that third pool happened
[1:07] and that word unlocked to that prophet
[1:10] it unlocked something in him
[1:13] friends it unlocked the mystery of his
[1:16] life cuz remember
[1:19] when when when that when that seal
[1:21] released and he he said remember he said
[1:23] he said it was the thing that I wondered
[1:25] my whole life
[1:28] right what Was it what to me I hope you
[1:33] understand
[1:35] he wondered was he Malachi 4 or not was
[1:38] he revelation 10 1-7 was that him but
[1:43] when that sword did the hand come and
[1:44] and the seals became revealed he said
[1:47] it's the thing that I wanted my whole
[1:48] life
[1:50] he didn't know if he was just going to
[1:51] be making a platform for another man to
[1:53] step on or not but when that seven
[1:57] revealed it unlocked what the mystery of
[1:59] Damn.
[2:04] But listen, don't stop there.
[2:11] Because the third pool
[2:14] should unlock the mystery in you.
[2:18] Amen.
[2:20] Cuz it's not What was the whole point of
[2:22] the third pool?
[2:24] It wasn't so brother Brandham could
[2:26] fish.
[2:29] The whole point of the third pull was to
[2:32] catch you.
[2:33] Amen.
[2:35] Amen.
[2:38] It's when this message comes into our
[2:40] life,
[2:42] it unlocks the mystery
[2:45] within you.
[2:48] You You have to see that you are that
[2:53] covenant fish.
[2:55] When when when you listen to the seventh
[2:57] seal and brother Bam talks about the
[2:58] third pool, you have to realize, "Mama,
[3:02] that's me."
[3:04] When you listen to the three kind of
[3:06] believers and you're saying, "Amen.
[3:08] Amen." And you get to the pop quiz at
[3:11] the end of the message and Brother Bram
[3:13] says, "If you still got the tape on and
[3:14] you ain't turned it off and you're in
[3:16] agreement, you are a believer.
[3:19] You are a covenant fish.
