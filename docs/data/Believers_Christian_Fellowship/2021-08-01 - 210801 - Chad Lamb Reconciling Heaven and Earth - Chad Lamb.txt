we've had lots of practice lately amen god has been really good we thank god you know it's a scary time for the world but it's a wonderful time for the bride of christ the world is growing in anxiety but god is continually doing something with us that we're not we don't fear to bring children into this earth because we know that god has a plan for each one and god has a plan for us we don't fear the things that are coming our way because god has already told us he's got a plan for his bride and she will crest every wave amen doesn't mean there won't be waves amen but the outriggers are put on the stabilizers on the ship and this bride this church of god will crest every wave and we see big waves coming but praise god he's given us his word and with his word came the fullness of his spirit and with christ's life in us amen this ship won't sink god is good amen also at the end of the service we'll have a baptism our brother chuck williams has decided he wants to he feels god pulling him him and i had a good conversation yesterday and god's drawing him and he wants to surrender all and he wants to take the lord's name and water baptism so we're very very excited for their family and for his testimony also i want to greet alana is alan and adam here there they are mr and mrs preston god bless you it's good to have you back [Applause] i know that they were here last week but i wasn't here to say mr and mrs preston and i've been looking forward to saying that for a couple weeks now amen god is wonderful is he not and while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the book of revelation revelation chapter 12. this message is a message that i preached out in des moines the saturday night that i was there with brother isaiah and his group and i i think i ministered on everything in my notes at one point or another but it seems like god just put it all together amen and i want to just minister it all in and one thought at least the way the lord's leading me and there's so many things here that i want to know more i want god to shine more light on all i know to do is walk in the light he gives and step forward and trust god to illuminate the next step but i want to minister on reconciling heaven and earth i'm going to look at revelation 12 7. and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out in the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuses them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death let's bow our heads and ask the lord to bless the reading of his word lord jesus we thank you god for this word that you've given to us god it is so precious and so dear to us and god you went through great lengths lord in a manifestation of this hour to vindicate this word so that we would trust the word that you've given to us so that you would open the book for us lord and give it to us and that we might eat it lord and when we eat that lord we can prophesy again and i pray god that you'd help us to speak your word to live your word to manifest this word in the fullness of its power we ask that you bless everything that we would say and do and may you have preeminence among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats amen i appreciate you praying for me my coughing is getting much much better i know how these allergy things work and it tends to have a path for me and that's just a little weakness in my body that i have to deal with but as i said god has been tremendous this year and has blessed me and given me help and i just trust that god's going to continue to help me so i appreciate your prayers amen we see here now i want to look at this last verse again verse 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death i think this is wonderful that the believer does not love his life unto death that he'll die to himself to take the word he'll die to himself to let this word live and then he'll surrender all in the message that day on calvary the prophet of god said sin did not start on earth sin started in heaven lucifer the devil was a condemned creature for his disobedience before he ever struck the earth sin began in heaven this is so important to note there's a reason brother branham goes through this so much and so much you know god has given us so much in this message that it has taken us decades amen to begin to see what god has already given amen he's given it to us and he's continually unfolding his word amen and i just want to make this statement this is completely off a sidebar i think it's a sidebar of what i intend to say this day but you know as god is continually revealing his word to us and unveiling amen he came and he delivered the message to us through a prophetic ministry and that message was able to to open the book amen and show us what god had written in the word and what he intended by that word and that message amen did that for us but the message is still unfolding itself there's treasures that are in there that lay undiscovered amen maybe somebody had found them but but we ourselves are continually seeing more and more and more and it's it's the unveiling of god and when the message came god did not have to give us a new bible the message came to illuminate what was already in the bible and god now doesn't have to bring us a new message amen god finished the work through the prophet but he's continually unveiling what he's given us out of this word and if god continues to do that amen we should see a continuation of the life of christ on the increase amen not the decrease because every denomination as they denominate you'll see generational slip think about every movement of god you see generational slip amen there was a generation that caught amen the fresh revelation from god they were feeding on the fresh manna it changed their lives it transformed them amen and then they would start a movement they would start a denomination to protect this thing that god gave them but then you can see generation by generation it slips until the wesleyan movement the methodist movement is nothing like the methodist movement was when it was first formed john wesley amen he would he would do be doing flip-flops in his grave if he knew what the methodist church was allowing and what they were participating in same thing with the pentecostal fathers in azusa street in 1906 they would just they would be grieved to know end to know what was happening with the pentecostal church and movement amen but it's because god was continuing to unveil and they quit moving with the light and they've been begin to digress but this day is not supposed to be like any other day amen this is a day when god has brought the fullness of his word and we are to take the book and eat the book amen and if doing so and if god is continuing to reveal himself in this message in this word then we should not see a generational slam but we should be seeing a generational climb that every generation in this message should be growing in revelation and the growth in revelation should produce more of the life of christ and we shouldn't get comfortable with things digressing amen that's not what the word came for the world came to bring us into a perfect rapturing condition we shouldn't see morality slipping we know we shouldn't see holiness slipping we shouldn't see our family lives slipping we shouldn't see per we should not see slipping but we should see by the revelation of the word in this hour a steady climbing to the likeness of jesus christ amen so that the whole harvest comes into the same maturity that we saw in the wave so it's not time to get comfortable with slippage that's a sign of denomination it's a sign that a denominational spirit has slipped in somewhere and i saw god keep us from that keep us steadily pursuing after god climbing word by word revelation upon revelation more into his likeness day by day sin began in heaven it didn't start on earth it began in heaven and we're still on that message that day on calvary sin began in heaven where god put the angels and so forth upon the same bases that he put human beings on knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree of life and the tree of knowledge you think well that didn't start until eden brother brenham said he already started it back there in heaven he put the angels on the same bases he put man on amen and and so they chose and and don't get caught up in and don't get locked down in terminology amen brother branham's using it as an example tree of knowledge tree of life amen and he's saying they had that choice amen and man couldn't take his choice and when lucifer was given the preeminence to make his choice he wanted something better than god had that started the trouble and the message let your light so shine before men he says do you know what caused the first battle in heaven was when lucifer set up a greater class of people got a better class of angels he thought a bigger a big and better kingdom a more brighter shinier kingdom than michael had and he was kicked out of heaven i think this is interesting and i just want to make mention of this where we look at this if lucifer looked at the kingdom of michael and he thought that he could do better he could have better than what god had that he could do something more or brighter or shinier or better we know that that that lucifer was made the brightest and the most beautiful of all the cherubims he was made in splendor he was made absolutely stunning and in that in that stunningness in that beauty that he had in wisdom he felt like he could do better and the point that i want to get to is god must not have done the maximum splendor that he could have created think about this do you think god could make lucifer so beautiful more beautiful than anything else he could make the kingdom of michael any way he wanted to make it but god didn't make it to the maximum and beauty to the maximum in splendor because that's not what god's looking for god's looking for character god wants the maximum character the maximum nature of god the maximum life of god not the maximum splendor not the maximum grandeur not the maximum wisdom that's not what god wants he made lucifer that way but he made michael's kingdom different than he made lucifer and he didn't do it to the maximum splendor the maximum luster and you say why amen it was reflecting god's nature and it also became a trap for the devil let's look at ezekiel 28 just so we can get this description again this is not foreign to us but i just want to read it again there's a few things i'd like to point out ezekiel 28 verse 11 this is a prophecy against the king of tyre but it's really against the spirit that was behind the king of tyre which is the spirit of satan and ezekiel 28 verse 11 says moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the psalm full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering this artist topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold and the workmanship of thy tabrts and of thy pipes was prepared in thee and the day that that was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wasted upon the holy mountain of god thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast his profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring to thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee and they that know know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more at some point this great creature that was created by god will be no more there is a path for lucifer from his creation to his annihilation in the path of lucifer from creation to annihilation amen is a path that will serve god's purpose god was not tripped up by lucifer god was not tricked by lucifer god was not surprised by lucifer because he knew the end from the beginning god knew it would be and then in order to display his attributes he needed an adversary and that's what satan means lucifer became satan and satan means adversary and so he became god's adversary so that in the face of an adversary all the attributes and characteristics of god could be on display so god when he was creating this lucifer he did not create him with a fork stick and a tail pointy tail and horns and an ugly vile looking creature amen but god made him the most beautiful the most desirable he had the all the precious stones were created in him when the day he was made the tabath and the pipes and everything was in him he was full of wisdom he was full of beauty he was beautiful to behold amen but but he he was corrupted he corrupted himself he was deceived by his own brightness he was corrupted by his own beauty amen all those things that god gave him he began to get lifted up in pride amen and within himself he began to accr corrupt himself and iniquity was found in him and iniquity is to know to do good and do it not or to know to do something and refuse to do it there was something that that that lucifer knew in the laws of god and the commandments of god and the structure that god had set in this heavenly realm he the lucifer knew these laws and he transgressed the laws of god by his iniquity he chose not to obey and when he made that choice amen he had the choice the same choice man had amen he could choose life or he could choose the knowledge of tree of good and evil and he chose the wrong one but he was deceived by his own brightness and his own own beauty and he made the wrong choice and when he made the wrong choice sin began in heaven so god we know brother man tells us before there was anything a molecule stardust anything there was just there was just god only he wasn't yet god he was elohim the self-existing one because god is an object of worship in order to be god he had to first make a creation that would worship him so he created angels and cherubims and seraphims and the heavenly hosts and they began to worship him making him god and in that creation he also made lucifer and remember lucifer be used to worship god until iniquity was found in him he was corrupted by his own beauty and my reason of his own brightness and see that's why when brother brennan makes a statement the way up is down if you want to see how great you can become see how little you can get brother ben's not just making a cutesy statement he's talking the very nature of god all the way back to the beginning he's understanding god could have made michael's kingdom greater but he didn't he made it more humble lucifer was the brightest and the greatest amen because that was going to become a deception to him he's going to be deceived by that and so so we shouldn't seek after those things but we should be content with where god gave us and after looking at these things and and looking at what god has done and how he has constructed uh the his system and his plan who he's always used who he's always chosen who he considers to be great and who the world considers to be great amen i come to the conclusion that slightly below average is a fine place for me i'm satisfied with what god has done i'm not trying to become anything that i'm not but i'm happy being what i am because god made it in a humble fashion he made it in a way without tremendous abilities without without tremendous backing or support why did god do that because he that's the way he did michael's kingdom in heaven amen and god's bride is going to be the same way and what's the mystery the mystery is not she's the biggest most powerful most beautiful with the greatest wisdom and the greatest minds of all time amen the mystery is that she's a humble little bride but she's his chosen and within her is the very character nature and life of god almighty that's the mystery that's the mystery that's been so hard for for the devil to catch because he doesn't understand humility he looked at you he looked at humility in michael's kingdom and thought he could override it he looked at humility in jesus christ and he thought he could override it he looked at humility and david thought he could override it he always thought that he could override that humility but he didn't realize that underneath the humility is a strength that's not that individuals but that strength comes from an attribute of almighty god because god doesn't show off his power because god's character god's nature is his power on display and so satan doesn't understand that so that's why god would pick a hillbilly from kentucky with a seventh grade education no formal bible training to be the prophet of the age because satan doesn't comprehend that he doesn't work that way he builds schools and makes bigger schools he gets degrees and he makes greater degrees he builds churches and builds bigger churches but god keeps moving right along coming through as humble servants he goes on to say in christ is the mystery of god revealed notice lucifer in the last days is doing as he did at first when did lucifer do the first thing that lucifer done to separate the fellowship of god and man he wanted to build him a united kingdom a greater splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater kingdom than michael christ had now now if you miss it just hold up your hand i'll say it again you see lucifer at the beginning his purpose and heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than christ had is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more splendor than the kingdom of christ let's turn to isaiah 14. and lay this passage in here as well and of isaiah 14 verse 12 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations i want you to notice lucifer has a title in ezekiel he's the anointed cherub the covering cherub in isaiah he's the son of the morning or the son of the dawn or the son of the beginning and christ is called the morning star so you see how close they are judas and jesus were both out of the tribe of judah they were close it's always so close but lucifer was the son of the morning he was he was the great one in the beginning amen but there was a morning star and that morning star was masked in humility but the sun of the morning was given grandeur and beauty the lucifer sun of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will send them to heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god that's you and i i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit so lucifer had an ambition about him something that he wanted to achieve that wasn't god's plan for him and wasn't what where god placed him he had a position and his position was a tremendous position as son of the morning as covering cherub but he wasn't happy with his position because he was so bright and so beautiful amen he couldn't be satisfied because he had no humility he had to have more and when he went to reach for more he fell and so he thought by his own willpower and his own brightness and his own intellect he could gain these things and gain the victory in heaven but he was cast out and that day on calvary brother bam says for satan had the earth the very rocks that once walked up and that the very rocks that he once walked them and down on the earth burning brimstone lucifer was the sun of the morning and he walked on the earth when it was a burning volcano i'm reading this for a purpose because brother branham is pointing out that satan when he was lucifer and he had a tremendous position and back when the earth was being formed when it was volcanoes and eruptions and burning he said satan walked upon the face of the earth look at what else he says in 1957 in the message what does it take to make a christian life he said let's take before there in the beginning of the world now the lily come from the earth so did you if that be so then we were here our bodies were on this earth before there was any life here we are made of the 16 different elements of the earth the potash calcium petroleum cosmic light and so forth and held together by atoms 16 elements of the earth then if that is so which is scientifically so then our bodies were laying spread out on this earth before there was any type of life on the earth and you wonder if you're predestinated or not potash calcium petroleum cosmic light was here in the creation as the volcanic was thrown out they tell us that burst and form the materials of the earth and so forth was it just a burning brimstone it was when it it was just a burning brimstone as it was satan's possession as he walked up and down the fiery brimstone of the earth in ezekiel it tells us thou have walked amongst the stones of fire and brother ben's telling us that that the earth in that original when it was originally made amen it became satan's possession he was walking through the stones of fire and the creation of the earth when there was a burning brimstone satan it was satan's possession as he walked up and down the fiery brimstone to the earth and then when god cooled it off and set it over there in his great mind he had something in his mind that he was going to do when god was bursting the volcanoes upon the this this planet amen i don't know i don't we don't have enough information to know what exactly was taking place but the prophet of god tells us that this was satan's possession as he walked amongst the stones of fire when god was forming this earth and then god would later take that molten earth and he would cool it off that's what he said then god would cool it off and set it over here in his great mind he had something in his mind that he was going to do back then when satan was walking upon it and the volcano's bursting and the molten rocks flying god had a purpose in his mind for what he was doing let's turn to genesis chapter 1. genesis chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters brother bam teaches us that there's a gap between genesis 1 1 and genesis 1 2 that there's a space of time something had happened there was an original creation and he tells us that as it was being created in the volcanics bursting that that was satan's possession and satan walked upon the earth at that time amen but then something happened on that earth on that creation and we find it here in the beginning of the bible it was without form and void and darkness was on the face of the deep amen it was covered in water again as if the earth had been judged and we don't know a lot about that and i don't want to presume and make up stuff about that but brother benham tells us clearly that that was satan's possession and satan walked upon that and now we look in genesis 1 2 and find that it's in a state of judgment something happened i don't know what happened but something happened and now the earth is void and without form and darkness is upon the face of the deep and god already before it gets to this condition amen before satan walked upon it in its volcanic condition god had a plan a purpose for this earth and everything's working according to this purpose so that when god comes here and now the earth is void and full of darkness and that water covers the face of the earth he already has a plan god is not just reacting to what satan has done he's not just reacting to a situation amen he's working out his plan there is a plan there is something he's trying to achieve and everything is working according to god's purpose and god's plan so whatever happened back there i don't know i don't know if it was linked to the war in heaven i don't know if it happened after he was cast out of heaven and come to the earth and there was another corruption on earth before we get to genesis 1 2 i don't know your guess is as good as mine all i know it was his possession at that time and he would brother ben called him satan and satan his adversary so it seems like after he was cast out he come to this possession but something happened to it and now it's in judgment and god is going to begin to reform it to continue on with his purpose and with his plan there's a lot of things that we don't know but what we do know is amazing what we do know is breathtaking that god has had a plan from before the foundation of the world and nothing that lucifer satan has done has stopped god's plan it has only the only thing that lucifer and satan has done is activated god's plan and kept it moving along he hasn't stopped it he hasn't railroaded it what he's done is the ultimate plan that was in god's mind the great thing that he wanted to achieve remember he had one great purpose one great achievement that he wanted to achieve and to come in a three-fold manner what was this great thing this purpose in god's mind he wanted to achieve it was the manifestation of the seventh seal it was god becoming tangible upon the earth god becoming a family god having fellowship with his attributes his attributes coming into materialization and and fellowshipping together as a family that was god's great goal god's great plan from before the foundation of the world and lucifer can't stop that plan i'll tell you he's the son of the morning he's been around a long time he was here before the formation of the earth he was here when the earth was being formed under volcanics he was a possessor of it at that time he was here amen he was doing all kinds of things rebellion in heaven war in heaven deceiving angels he's been here a long time he's been around a long time but i've existed in the thoughts of god longer than he amen god had thoughts amen and those thoughts were his attributes and they were attributes of himself and the desire of a manifestation of himself and a fellowship with himself amen and in order to bring that fellowship about with all the family of god having an understanding of the nature of god he needed an adversary and in his mind he would he would we would think of the very best adversary he could have to bring out all his qualities and lucifer was made in perfection and in beauty and in wisdom and with every gift imaginable with all splendor that you could possibly pack in because god needed a worthy adversary because before he thought of lucifer he thought of you he thought of you upon this earth in this day manifesting an attribute of god before he created the adversary and before the adversary became an adversary he still had a plan brother chad that's you're getting the deep waters no it's simple friends if we can see there's a reason the prophet of god explained these things there's a reason that these things are in the bible amen it's there so you and i would know nothing is out of kilter everything's ticking right on time i don't need to be afraid i don't mean to be nervous hey listen things happen in our lives we live in bodies of flesh we have pressures that come anxieties that build but we need to come back to the revelation that was before this trouble amen before there was a sickness before there was a financial need before i had problems at work before there was stress in my family before that just keep going back and going back and going back and going back until you can go back so far that you realize everything's under control i have nothing to be afraid of we're not preaching deep to preach deep we're talking about things that have been given to us so that we will realize that there's nothing that we need to be afraid of on this earth there's nothing we need to be worried about or stress about or have anxiety about we need to rest and keep walking and if we will learn to rest and keep walking you will watch supernatural god will rearrange all the events in your life because he had a plan before the foundation of the world before volcanics broke out before war in heaven before it all he had a plan and lucifer has not been able to derail his plan yet he's not going to be able to do it today brother brahm says in the fourth seal said i was talking to a person not long ago he was trying to discuss with me and saying aren't you ashamed to say that god created the heavens and earth and in six days i said that's what the bible said he said well we've got evidence and can prove that the world is millions of years old i said that didn't have anything to do with them that don't have anything to do with it in genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning god created heavens and earth period see that's all now the world without form and void and he said i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and your guess is as good as mine on that i've given you all the information i got so far but we know satan was the possessor of the earth at that time we know he walked among them but what happened we don't know and how it happened we don't know but brother bam says i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off and the light struck it up come the trees and everything the same thing in human beings it's a time when the mist is moved away and revealed truth to the real seedling they're still germatized and the light of the gospel can strike it by a true vindication of the word it'll live it's got life outside of that it can't live it hasn't got no life in them god is showing through the prophet here that in the beginning when he began to speak to this creation that was now amen genesis 1 2 amen now void and without form darkness covering the face of the deep but the spirit of god was hovering over it and he began to speak and as the spoken word came forth he began to move things into a certain condition to create a certain atmosphere amen and god wasn't working randomly but he was working very specifically and he spoke a very specific word to bring a very specific result to get a very specific condition to bring forth a seed that he knew that was already laying down there under the water and god moved in such a way that that seed that was already dermatized already had life in it that that sea would spring forth and what god was doing in the in the in the recreation of the earth and the reforming of the earth he was showing amen that that down in there there was already seeds that god had created by spoken word some time before and those spoken word seeds were laying in there amen under a judgment condition but he was by the spoken word going to create a condition that'll begin to part waters and bring light and create atmosphere and when the light would finally get to that sea it would spring forth the life because it had life on the inside and he was typing our redemption amen he was typing our conversion amen because we come to this life and when we come to this life buried down under a state of judgment because you were born in a judged condition and when you're born in a judge conditioned because of sexual birth amen you're shrouded in darkness amen but god by a spoken word is going to begin to speak his word and it's going to begin moving the darkness back and separating the light from the darkness and bringing an atmosphere and bringing a light that will penetrate and when that light hits that seed down inside in your soul amen it's already got life in it it has life in it from some previous civilization or something something from before something from before the state of judgment there was life in there from before you come into the state of judgment and when the light hits that life it springs forth to life and that begins to grow and take over your life brother random is showing that god was showing us our regeneration our new birth he says in the message one in a million did you ever notice a seed as reverend pitts was speaking a few moments ago how a seed goes into the ground many seeds are there in the ground when god moved upon the water with the light and the light brought forth the first presence of god spoken light come by god's word and god's word is the only thing that still brings a light and when the waters went back the seed was already in the earth and the light only brought forth the seeds that remained with german them the light only brought forth the seeds that remain with german not all the seeds but the seeds with the germ of life inside that light will bring forth not every one but those with life inside now on easter morning there was another light struck the earth when the holy spirit was given and it's given to bring life to those seeds that god by his foreknowledge knew that would be here on the earth as he knew the first natural seed he knows where the spiritual seed is your body was laying here right then on the earth when god first brought the earth into existence my goodness if god laid the elements for your body knowing that down the road he would need these elements to make your body when something begins to happen to your body why don't we turn to the one who laid the elements here before the foundation of the world and say god i need help with this body you lay the elements out here like he says like a great contractor he lays it all out he knows he's going to be building in each stage that he's going to build until he gets to completion and he lays all his material out and the material for your flesh body was laid here when he first formed the world and if you're having problems with your flesh body with the material that was laid here turn to the one who laid it here and had a plan for it and still has a plan today and say god this is the situation but i know you laid these elements on this earth to form this body to manifest your glory in this day and i'm asking you to do your work in me today see the devil tries he's trying to make us afraid because when we're afraid amen we begin to get nervous and we turn our eyes from the promise and we begin to doubt we begin to question amen and that's not how god fulfills his word he fulfills his word by giving us a faith to believe his word because the word of god operates by faith so the devil is trying distractions and fear tactics and anxiety and i say turn back to the one who knew before the foundation of the world and said god you knew i would be here you knew i would have a need you provided a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world to meet this need and i'm trusting in you to meet the need and then forget about it that's what brother bam says go on confess your healing and act like you're healed see then on easter morning he knew your body was laying right here then on the earth when god first brought the earth into existence we are part of the earth we were laying there and by his foreknowledge he knew exactly who would love him and who would serve him and who would not his foreknowledge tells that if it doesn't then he isn't god he can't be god without being infinite and if he's infinite he knows all things in the greatest battle ever fought he says this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven that's important don't forget that sin started in heaven sin did not originate on earth sin originated in heaven and sin is unbelief and when it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this that's what this purpose was was to destroy him then the battle began on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since so we know that the sin started in heaven and the first battle was in heaven and and satan lucifer and his angels were cast out of heaven and we know at some point he was on the earth in the formation of the earth it was his possession but we know between genesis 1 1 and genesis 1 2 something happened amen brother i said there were seeds already laying here from something that happened before before we get to genesis 1 2. so there was something there and the seeds that were coming forth was a reflection of what was on the other side and and god now is making this for himself brother venom says and when god makes it we know it was satan's possession before but now when god makes it he makes the earth and he makes the garden of he makes eden and in the eden he makes a garden and then he sets his son there then he hands the son the title book the title deed to creation what do you think satan thought of that the the earth was his possession at one point according to the prophet of god and now this there's been a judgment and a re-creation and then the recreation now there's a son of god upon the earth and god takes the title deed to all this earth and creation and he hands it to his son no wonder satan begins to attack right there because what does he want he wants rights back to the earth amen and so now adam is holding the title deed to all creation and satan wants it back but he can't get that title deed we know when adam lost the title deed he went to the hands of the one who originated it went back to god's hand but god never wanted this title in heaven he wanted it to be on earth amen god gave it to man on earth he wanted his children and the former man to have it on earth god didn't want it he didn't need a title deed he didn't make himself a title deed he made it for his son and when he lost it amen he couldn't let it get into the hands of satan so it goes back into the original owner's hand which is god himself but god didn't make this title deed for himself he made it for his children amen for his attributes for his family and that's why that title deed in this day had to be restored back into the hands of sons and god sons and daughters of god and do you what do you think the devil thinks about that do you think he's just going to let you go on confessing that and that you're a joint heir with jesus christ and he's going to be completely dispossessed of everything that he claims to have rights to now do you think he's just going to roll over and let that happen amen when god put it in the hands of man what did he attack he attacked man he attacked the seed to stop the race of man from coming forth amen to stop to stop man from fulfilling this purpose and now amen the title deeds been back taken back in the hands of jesus christ amen and he's and he's handed it down to you and i amen he's wanting us to be joint heirs with him to dispossess satan of everything that he's laying claims to and you wonder why you have troubles we get surprised when we have difficulties when we have tormenting thoughts in our mind when we have debilitating issues and and circumstances that come against us and and we just think that somehow we've got bad luck and i'm somehow always stumbling and always well you have you have to go back and understand what is going on in the big picture amen we got to get out of our little microcosm here and fly up with eagles wings and say what is really going on all around me amen there's a warfare going on because what started in the battle started in heaven now come down to human beings and that battle is going on and you and i praise god he says we're still in the greatest battle ever fought and when it was thrown down from heaven cast out of him to earth and fell on human beings and the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation which god created for himself he he had satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since don't think in any strange thing concerning the fiery trials that are to try you as though some strange thing has happened unto you well who said that peter it's not unusual to see that the warfare is still going on in the fourth seal prophet says look what this is all coming to what is it it's going right back to the way it did it started in heaven it's coming to the end time battle there there's a a battle a war that started in heaven but there will be an end to this war lucifer had a beginning but he will have an annihilation he will have an end you and i and the thoughts of god had no beginnings so we will have no end why do you think he fights you so much because you and your humility and your weakness and your vessel of clay and all of that stuff you have a greater inheritance a greater position a man a greater promise a greater power than anything that he possesses why does he fight you so hard because he can't ever be what you are but he's trying to stop you from coming into your full inheritance amen he wants to stay a squad squatter with squatter rights upon the earth it started in heaven it's coming to the end time battle the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and came to the earth then he polluted eden then he's been polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven it's coming to the battle on earth and it is to be finished on earth at the time in a battle called armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven and so they kicked them out michael and his angels overthrowed them just run out and when they did it dropped right down into eden and here started the battle down here so the battle is continuing on friends started in heaven dropped to the earth and we know that that this this is a spiritual battle that's going on and it takes on physical manifestations but it's a spiritual battle and it's going on all around us brother baby says in the message the invisible union of the bride of christ he says when you see the woman a byproduct not another female like her made in that order knowing that she would be deceived god knowed if he didn't know the end from the beginning then he wasn't god if he isn't infinite and he can't be infinite without being omniscient omnipresent knowing all things eternal so he knowed all things and he had to make that woman that man didn't have a wife the wife and the man was the same thing he had the feminist and masculine spirit in himself he had to separate take a byproduct after the whole creation made no female created by god and the original creation can do a thing like that she was made thus to do it he knowed she would do it if he didn't he wasn't gone but see the attributes that's in god had to be displayed he was to be savior and to make everything perfect the way he had it then there couldn't could be nothing lost oh don't be children be men and women were at the end of the road god when he was recreating to earth and he was fashioning it for his pleasure because eden means pleasure he put everything the way he wanted it and he got his son and his son's wife there and he had everything just right and he was a holder of the title deed and and god when he was refashioning the earth when he was speaking amen to the to the light to appear into the clouds departing the waters to separate and when he was doing all this he knew there would be a fall when he put a tree of knowledge of good and evil in a tree of life he knew there would be a wrong choice he knew there would be a fall amen and we have to understand god knew from before the foundation of the world he knew there would be a fall so the fall must somehow work to his plan to manifest himself amen to have an ultimate victory over his enemy and to be displayed as god so these things have to be this way when he created lucifer he knew that lucifer would turn he knew what would happen he knew that there would be a great fall and then a fall and then a fall and then a fall and a fall and a fall because the jewish church fell the first church fell amen falling falling falling god had a plan and christ is the mystery of god revealed he says so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels then they worshiped him and that made him gone and he started from there as in previous messages i have tried to explain it break it down and now then when angels began to worship him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there wasn't no sun no moon no stars no nothing and then he was gone as he asked job where were you when i laid the foundation of the world see when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shouted for joy see where were you that was way back before the earth before god had even created the earth and brother baby says the earth could be millions and billions trillions of years old he doesn't know but way back before that he's asking where was you when i laid the foundation of the world when i the morning stars sang together the suns shouted for joy where were you that was way back before the earth now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on the church this morning the hidden mystery of god what's he preaching christ is the mystery of god revealed he said way back before the earth was even created when he was giving this revelation amen to the attributes to the sons he said back then he had a purpose and a hidden mystery he had a purpose and a hidden mystery he had his mind before the world ever began and how it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you will understand clearly then you will see on i believe what is being done brother branham wanted you to go all the way back and see what was in the back parts of god's mind this hidden mystery this great purpose he purposed in his mind to achieve so that you will understand what's going on and that part of that understanding is to bring us an understanding in this day not just to understand what happened but to understand why it happened and what's happening today let's turn to revelation 13. revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world this lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so god knew there would be a fall before he formed the world is that true why else would he have his own son as a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world and names in a book amen of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world there wasn't even a world yet here to fall he already was planning redemption before there was an earth before there was a creation amen before there was brother said before there was an atom or a molecule god already had this plan in his mind and he already had the lame slammed from slain from before the foundation of the world amen so god knew that there would be a fall he knew the earth would fall into this condition he knew there would be a satan's eden and he knew there would be a little bride that would come forth in satan's eden nothing is beyond god's knowledge and without his foreknowledge and so god knew let's go to isaiah 46. we know many of these things but i just want to lay them in very very good isaiah 46 remember you have to drive a nail to make it clean so let's just keep driving nails because i want this revelation to clench i want to stop acting like a scared child every time something bad happens to me i want to stop ringing my hands i want to stop uh uh crying i want to stop this anxiety i want to stop all of these things that happen to me when troubles come i want to stop acting like a child and i want to act like a full-grown bride one who's got a husband who's taking care of her and i don't have to worry i don't have to fret i don't have to stress i'm tired of acting like a child this is not the age for childness childlike and behaviors and this is the age for us to be adults sons and daughters of god that's come to maturity in isaiah 46 9 it says whoa i'm sorry 46 9. remember the former things remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure what will stop that nothing and the fourth seal he says god has children god had his children all fortified up with his word and eve stuck her neck out i believe you're right maybe in there it went and it's been ever since then god come down listen and then god come down now he's got to he come down to redeem those that would come down and he planned it before the foundation of the world before there was a molecule star dust adam before there was anything in a physical creation god had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world he had a plan where he would come down to redeem them that would come down amen he didn't make the plan after he started creation and after there was a fall he planned to come down and redeem us before there was a fall because he knew that we would come down wherever he come down from you've come down from oh god is trying to break our spiritual amnesia so that we can remember where we've come from and who we are amen it's just it's still foggy yet but it's moving and we're moving into those realms to understand amen that i'm not always i wasn't i wasn't the son of charles and elle abraham amen amen i was always a son of god i was always predestinated i was in god's mind i had fellowship with the attributes before the foundation of the world he showed me his plan of redemption and i shouted for joy i wasn't in this form with this mind and this understanding i wasn't like this i don't know what i was like but whatever i was like it was god amen it was part of god and destined to be an offspring of god and that has come down but before it came down he already had a plan that he would come down and redeem all them that would come down because redemption was part of his plan if redemption was part of his plan and there was a land slam from before the foundation of the world then god needed to express redemption so he needed to respect the redemption he needed to have a fall if he was going to have a fall he had to have an adversary if he was going to have an adversary he was going to have to create a being and that being was going to be so perfect and amen he was going to allow that being the preeminence to make its own choice but because he needed an adversary he would pack every wonderful thing that he could pack into this being so it would be the greatest of all creations so that it would make the wrong choice by self-will and fall and cause a fall in heaven was that devastating it was devastating but was it outside god's plan it was not outside god's plan whatever happened in heaven was horrible because whatever happened on earth was horrible we're still suffering the consequences of what took place in eden and i would say heaven is still suffering the consequences of what took place in heaven see this isn't the age for children this is to be children this isn't the age where we say you know once you go beyond this realm into the heavenly realm everybody's floating on clouds and playing harps and all having wings it's not like that there's war up there there's opposing armies there's fighting going on all the time we talked about this a few weeks ago but when daniel set himself to pray he began to pray and as he was praying from the the gabriel was dispatched to take him a message but because there was a strife and there was there was hierarchies and there was powers there was authorities and there was and there was a uh realms of authority amen gabriel was sent from the first time daniel prayed and when daniel prayed and gabriel began to move but for 21 days he could not get to daniel amen this is a mighty messenger angel from god could not get to daniel because the prince of persia amen the power that was over persia a demonic power was withstanding him so he had to go back and get michael and michael helped him get through tell me there's not a problem in the heavenlies there's a problem in the heavenlies so i want to go to heaven but i don't want to go to that part of heaven i want to go to another part of heaven something happened and it was terrible and the effects of that first fall were still feeling today just like in the natural the effects of the first fall on earth and eden we're still feeling the effects of that today see this message took us back beyond just the natural he came down to redeem those that would come down i just like saying that that does something to me as i said god's like a big contractor he lays out all his material on the earth and then he builds his building now remember before there was a grain of seed on the earth before there was a sun that was ever struck the earth your body was laying on the earth because you are the dust of the earth so you are god's the contractor praise god let's turn to john chapter one i still have a lot of ground i'd like to cover by the grace of god so don't get tired yet there's something burning in my heart i just want to share saint john 1 11. he come to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god that word become is translated almost everywhere else in the bible is be he gave them power to be the sons of god he gave us power to move into adoption he gave his power to be the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god amen your your new birth on this earth was the will of god amen it wasn't your choice it wasn't that you someday decided god but it was by the will of god he knew you would come forth and he wanted you to come forth in luke 19 jesus says the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost he didn't come to seek and to find something he wanted he come to seek and to save that which was lost he was looking for that which came down which would come down he was in here looking for that he was seeking out his own he said they told the father he said thine they were and thou has given them to me they already belonged to the father and the father gave them to the son and the son was here looking for the ones that had gotten lost but they were the fathers originally amen because you can't lose something that's not yours originally so now i want to i want to move in and look at the work of reconciliation if we could go to colossians chapter 1. colossians chapter one verse 15. now this is the portion of scripture brother brennan begins reading when he preaches crisis the mystery of god revealed and he starts here in colossians chapter one and there's a quote that i'm going to quote out of this in just a moment he says verse 15 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created there in heaven and that are in earth visible invisible whether it be thrones or dominions or principalities our powers all things were created by him and for him so look we've got both things that are in heaven and earth visible and invisible thrones dominions principalities powers both visible and invisible there are thrones and powers and and all of this stuff in the heavenly realm just as there is on the earth it was all created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven now let's look at this statement this is where brother branham's going to inject a statement he's reading this scripture and he's going to just inject a statement at the end of this and i'll read it again so you catch him and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth are things in heaven so there has to be a reconciliation of all things whether they be on earth or whether they be in heaven and when brother branham comes to this place he says watch where that reconciliation went what a statement we look at the we look at jesus christ coming to earth and dying amen on a cross to be the lamb of god amen the propitiation for our sins and he pays that price and we in our minds think that that only has to do with the fall in eden but this scripture here is telling us that it's more than just a fall in eden because heaven needs to be reconciled as well and he reconciled all things in the body of his flesh amen when he died on calvary whether they be things on earth or whether they see things in heaven so it shows that this work of reconciliation amen it has to do with earth but it also has to do with heaven so when god came down in flesh in the life of jesus christ and he shed his own blood amen he wasn't just fixing earth but he was also reconciling heaven in the body of his flesh god had a plan there was a great fall things have been disrupted in the heavens although lucifer was cast out he was cast out and his angels was cast out but we find him in revelations 12 he's the accuser of the brethren and you go all the way back to job which brother branham said job is the oldest book written in the bible and in job you see a day when the sons of god present themselves in the god and satan comes among them amen and and and god asked him what he's doing what have you been doing he said i've been walking to and fro all over the earth he said have you considered my servant job there is none like him in all the earth and satan says does job serve thee for naught don't does thou not have a hedge about him what's satan doing he's accusing job he's saying job only loves you because you bless him stop blessing him and he won't love you he'll curse you to your face what is satan doing now he is in heaven as the accuser of the brethren because he was cast out of heaven there was a fall and he began to accuse the brethren now he can present himself in the heavenly realm when god when the sons of god present themselves i don't know how it works don't come and say brother chad how does it work all i know is what the bible says he was cast out but he's still doing something in heaven he what's he doing he's accusing the brethren like he was accusing job so there's still a problem in heaven amen there's spirits and there's principalities and there's powers that will withstand gabriel that will hold him back from getting a message to one of god's children there's still things that aren't right so god came down in the tabernacle of flesh amen and this is not time to be children but full-grown believers amen what god was doing he had a plan and all along in his plan was a lame lamb slain before the foundation in the world and in that body of flesh he was reconciling all things all things all things all things and by him were all things made everything that was made god is now reconciling in the body of his flesh so this reconciliation has to do with earth and heaven the word reconciliation here means when it says by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven this word reconcile means to reconcile completely to reconcile back again to bring back a former state of harmony what is god trying to do through his plan of redemption he's trying to bring everything back into a state of original harmony what is this plan of redemption that we're caught up in what is this plan of redemption that's going on all around us amen it's god trying to reconcile all things back to himself again and reconcile both things in heaven and in earth and you're caught right up in the middle of it because that battle moved from heaven come down to human beings and is going on right in you and i now the battle for earth and the battle for heaven is going on and you and i let's turn to hebrews 9. hebrews chapter 9. 19 hebrews 9 19. for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission it was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in heaven should be purified with these now stop reading he's saying that when moses built the tabernacle in the vessels it was a pattern of the things that were in heaven god lifted him up in the mountain and showed him the tabernacle and he told him to make a replica on earth and so the pattern on earth had to be purified with the blood of bulls and goats amen so there was a purification by blood that would purify the vessel the tabernacle and all the instruments and so god was god was laying down a pattern amen from heaven upon the earth but the pattern before it could be used it had to be purified and it was purified by blood now let's read the scripture again verse 23 it was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifice than these so if the pattern had to have a sacrifice and a sprinkling of blood for cleansing then the heavenly things the things that they were patterned after the tabernacle of heaven had to have a better sacrifice than these why for purification and you're saying you mean something in heaven has to be purified that's what the scripture is telling us these things that on earth had to be purified by these sacrifices but the things in heaven by better sacrifice than these for christ is not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figure of true but in the heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us you see god laid a pattern on earth and he said make it according to this fashion so he he patterned what was in heaven he patted on earth and before he could use it it had to be purified it was purified by blood amen and so that was wonderful we understand that it's natural it has to be purified but the bible says it was purified by these sacrifices but the things the heavenly themselves with better sacrifice than these the scripture tells us that when he speaks to lucifer in ezekiel 28 he says thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries where did sin take place where did it originate in heaven sin originated in heaven there was a corruption that came into the heavenlies there was a pollution that was entered into the heavenlies and now all things are being reconciled in the body of jesus christ both things that are in heaven and earth and things that are in heaven amen it's all got to come back to a reconciliation so god is using this plan of what's going on down here and through this plan he's fixing the whole program even the blood of jesus christ you think what i don't understand that i'll tell you i don't understand it either but i know this that jesus christ had to go beyond the holy of holies and he had to be the sacrifice that would purify the things that were the heavenlies because that's where sin broke out where was lucifer a covering cherub where's the covering chair brother brown said god's right hand man he was right there with god and right there with god he polluted his sanctuaries he defiled them so god was going to come and be the high priest and the high priest was going to reconcile back and he was going to bring a sacrifice that would purify not the vessels on earth but the heavenly themselves god is using this plan of redemption to reconcile the whole program and we are caught right in the middle of this plan of redemption everything that's going on in heaven and everything that's going on earth the warfare the reconciliation the purging everything has everything to do with you it's bigger than our problem it's bigger amen it's bigger than just all the little things that we see if we can just fly a little higher and say this plan of god is so much bigger amen if i could just escape my small thinking and i could just back up and see that god through this plan of redemption is fixing everything i just want to be part of this plan of redemption i don't want to take my own mind my own thinking i don't want to get distracted i just want to stay tuned into this because god is reconciling god is fixing god is purging god is restoring back to its original harmony and he's doing it through this plan of redemption let's turn to ephesians chapter 6. verse 10. finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high that word high means heavenly places you're here battling it out on earth but you're not fighting a carnal battle you're here on earth oppressed afflicted tormented with struggles but this is not a fleshly battle this is not a carnal battle we are not fighting against flesh and blood but we are fighting its principalities and powers in heavenly places this is still spiritual warfare going on in the heavenlies it has everything to do with you living your life every day like i said it's so much bigger than what we think we get going along and and we we we we just do the same routine day after day and we we just live and work and do the things that we do and we can easily get caught in that mode and miss what god is doing in this day because we're not warring after the things of earth we're not against the government we're not against taxes we're not against our neighbor we're not against the guy at work what are we fighting against we're warring against principalities and powers in heavenly places and that means there's still warfare going on in heavenly places and the battle dropped down from heaven and dropped into you and i and the battle's still raging let's go to second corinthians chapter five ii corinthians chapter five verse 16. verse 16 that wherefore henceforth now know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh you now henceforth knowing him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation so this ministry of reconciliation is still going on but where is it going on now who did he give the ministry of reconciliation to this is the apostle paul talking he's saying now he has given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation now then we we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you and christ's dead be ye reconciled to god he said we are ambassadors for god and we are here we're praying to you in place of christ in christ said we're calling to you be ye reconciled to go to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him there's a spiritual warfare go on there's a reconciliation of all things heaven and earth it was reconciled in the body of flesh of jesus christ and the work of reconciliation then was given to the apostle paul and what's he doing he's reconciling back amen heaven he's reconciling back to those that came down he's bringing them back in contact with god again and there's a warfare going on to stop them in the message the new ministry from 1959 he says now you say well if he knows it then why are you preaching that's part of god's program preaching is his program brother man's talking about god who knows all things he knew the beginning from the end and he says if he knows that then why are you preaching if god's going to save him anyways just let god save him and brother man i'm saying no you don't understand god's program god knew that there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world he knew there would be a fall he knew he would reconcile all things in the body of his flesh he knew that there would be a high priest that could go amen to the holy of holies in heaven amen for purification he knew it he knew it before he began to work his plan but realize he got to know god's program you have to know how god works his plan he goes on to say when he looked upon the apostles he looked upon the harvest he said the harvest is ripe and the laborers are few pray the lord of the harvest that he will send laborers into his harvest how many remember that well why would they have to pray to the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest if the lord of the harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why god has so arranged it that now listen to this god has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and i and as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we are paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the holy ghost we're in god's will doing his program oh i say this is a good program you agree this is a good program that god had before the foundation of the world we're coming back the title deed of redemption has been brought back it's brought back to a people who would understand his word who had been lifted out of a laodicean condition be lifted out of cardinal into the supernatural so that they could have the understanding to live this life victorious by obeying the word and in doing so they are reconciling all things and in doing so they are bringing things back to the condition that they should have been in and that's why the devil fights you that's why he's against you that's why troubles come in waves they don't just come one at a time now they come three at a time what is it we're nearing the fullness of the redemption we're coming to the change in the body amen we're about to drive the final nail in his coffin for the gentile dispensation and the devil is fighting so hard for you to take your position to stay in platoon with the word to stay where god wants you to be a ministry of reconciliation he wants to stop you from doing that but it's too late god has peeled back the seals and he showed us his great plan and god has predestinated the people on this earth to catch the vision to catch the revelation and what god wanted and what god intended and they're here willing to lay down their lives for god to fulfill his purpose let's look at luke chapter 10. luke chapter 10. and in luke here jesus sends out his disciples two by two to preach that the kingdom has come that the kingdom is at hand so he sends them out two by two preaching the message of the hour that's what they're preaching they're preaching the word for their day they're preaching the message of the hour and they're told to pray for the sick and cast out devils and and do all those things so they're going out preaching from city to city they're preaching the message of the hour and the demonstrations are following and when they return they they speak to jesus in verse 17 luke 10 17 and the 70 returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven when they came back god had sent them out to preach the message of the hour and when they were preaching the message of the hour they had power over devils to cast them out to heal the sick and when they expressed that they had powers over devils jesus said behold i see satan as lightning falling from heaven he says now i want to go on and read a few more then we'll go to a quote here behold i give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven brother branham says in the message thy house referring to this scripture it says by i beheld satan falling from heaven like lightning now i'll just kindly outline this and if it doesn't do it then you just let me know and i'll i'll go into detail do you remember we'll get the we'll get that when we come into it further on the scriptures on our study over here that was immediately after that jesus gave his disciples power against unclean spirits and they went out casting out devils he sent them two by two and said don't go to the gentiles but go rather to the lost sheep of israel and as you go preaching then the kingdom of heaven and heal the sick and cast out devils and so forth and then they come back rejoicing happily now come back happily rejoicing and he said rejoice not that your names rejoice not the devils is subject in you but rejoice because your names are written in heaven said i beheld satan falling from heaven like lightning see the power of that church moving forward had just upset the whole kingdom of satan the power of that church listen they weren't even born again yet amen christ hadn't even died yet but the power of that church moving forward in the program of god upset satan's kingdom oh my goodness what hour should we be living in what kind of kingdom upsetting should be going on right now you see and he saw him as it dropped from his places he saw him as he dropped from his places because god had again given power to his church he beheld him falling like lightning from heaven he was cast plum out of the holy place and everything you see by the power of the power of that church of them having power she said i give you power over unclean spirits see what they really upset the kingdom of satan what could we do with it today what is the goal today what's the purpose of having the word today it's the move forward in the power of god by the revelation of the word and by god's spirit amen anointing that word to upset the devil's kingdom because he's got to fall again amen because we know that when the church goes up when the bride goes up he comes down there's got to be another falling light lightning of satan coming down losing his position when will he lose his position when you and i get into ours when we go up he comes down there's got to be another church on this earth that is moving in the power of god by the revelation of the word with the spirit here to back it up and what is that doing upsetting his kingdom that's what he wants to stop you from brother remember says he's interested in you he's interested in me he's interested to see his word made manifest and he's depending on us to do it for we are his agents nothing in ourselves it's him yielding ourselves and walking with him we're his agents but it's not anything we can do but it's something we have to yield ourselves to we have to see the word and yield to the word we have to love not our lives unto death but we have to die to ourselves brother branham says in the in the seventh seal remember after the fourth chapter of revelation the church is gone the force horse four horse riders has went out church is gone everything that happened to the church happened to the fourth chapter of the book of revelations everything that happened in the antichrist move went up to the fourth chapter and the fourth seal of revelation both for antichrist and christ ended up an antichrist comes to his doom with his army and christ comes with his army it's an old battle that started way back beyond time i'm so glad we had a prophet to show us what's going on you know what he's telling us he's telling us what's going on every day in our lives he's trying to explain to us what the battle is all about and what the spiritual warfare all around us is it's an old battle that started way back beyond time satan and his angels were kicked out and when they come to earth the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word i say god help me not to let down the bar from your word god i need your help but i want to keep this word with all that's in me my greatest desire is to keep your word my greatest desire is to stay with the word that you've given us in this day not to compromise it not to change it not to explain it away but to stay submitted to it let's turn to second corinthians chapter 10. look at the scripture now remember that's how satan won the battle over god's word is when one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word that's what he's done in every denomination in every church age he's got them to let down the bar on the word he would send them the word and they would take the word and have a revival around that word but then they would begin to compromise on the word and let down the bar on the word and let's look at second corinthians chapter 10 now paul the apostle is writing in verse 3 he says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnival mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds so this once again is another way paul's declaring to us we're not fighting an earthly battle this is a supernatural spiritual battle these are powers principalities in heavenly places that we're warring with and the weapons are our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds these weapons we've been given will pull down the devil's strongholds casting down imaginations where is imaginations in the mind where's the greatest battle ever fought where's the new battleground in your mind casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ so now these weapons of our warfare are mighty bringing down strongholds amen and bringing every captive every thought amen pulling down every high thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of god and casting down imaginations this is the equipment that's been given to us the power of the revealing of the word to break amen the the power of the devil to mess up our minds to bring wrong thoughts and imaginations and and knowledge that exalts itself against the knowledge of god it is all to be defeated by the word of god and we've been given mighty weapons in this day because the word has been restored and it will bring down the strongholds of wrong thinking the strongholds of denominational thinking the strongholds of laodicean thinking the strongholds of reasoning and wisdom and intellect of man will be brought down amen what is it those are the devil's tools that trip you up on the word but those strongholds will be brought down by the word of god that's given to us on this day and look at the result verse 6 in having and readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled when you finally come to the place of full surrender to the full word of god when your obedience is fulfilled or completed there'll be a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled say god go get that devil no you just obey when your obedience is fulfilled he'll revenge all disobedience god go get those people go get that they're they're lying against the word and the enemies working against my children and all that you quit fighting that and you come into obedience to the word because when your obedience is completed he'll revenge all disobedience he's looking for a bride to come to a full surrender to the full word of god and when her obedience is fulfilled what has happened there's never been a bride that could fully obey amen there's been a bride that fell then a bride that fell then a bride that fell then a bride that fell but he's predestinated one that won't fall by the word she'll stand on that word and she'll come to a full surrender to the word and when her obedience is fulfilled he'll revenge all disobedience oh i'm past the time of saying god get him god get him god get him i'm saying god help me amen help me to live this word help me to know this word to surrender to it to die to myself and give up every desire all selfishness all self-will let me not love my life unto death but let me die so that i can come to that full obedience because when one subject let them down the bar on the word satan got victory over the word the battle is between lucifer and the word of god satan is battling that word and when you let down the bar on the word he gets it he once again gets victory over the word and that's how he's won the battle every time the greatest battle ever fought he says and i thought of the order of the heavenly host not one of them is out of place everyone keeps its time perfectly god's great army i thought of the soldiers how that that moon would happen to get out of order the earth would be covered again with water just in a few minutes the earth would be just like it was when god decided to use it for it to have us here on on it it was without form and void and darkness and water was upon the breath of the earth and if that moon would ever move it would do the same thing again when the moon rocks a little bit away from the earth the tides come up when it goes down just follow the tides it's god's great army and when i thought that being god's great army he's speaking of the heavenly host and they're all they're all in their position they're all in their place and when there's one little movement of those it affects earth and he's typing the heavenly host with us because god told abraham look at the look up at the stars if you can count them so shall thy seed be so the royal seed is like the stars in heaven and brother venom tells us how god created amen he he had the sun a little burning ball and he'd spit a little clicker out and that little clinker would go moving amen and as it moved through space it'd eventually get to a place he would say stop and another little clinker come off in another and he'd stop and stop he said what's he doing he's writing his bible in the sky he's writing his bible what are those stars those stars represent sons and daughters of god amen what is the words in the book it's the believer amen he's writing his bible with those stars in the heaven and if that heavenly host would ever get out of position it would wreck things on the earth that's what happened when eve got out of her position she wrecked things on the earth he says now continue on the same quote now we went to bed and then i begin to think that not one of those gets out of their place they all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them it's for a cause and will affect this earth we just see the result of it now from some of them moving into other spots it's affected it's a it affects everything and i thought then if that great heavenly host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the earthly host how when one gets out of order it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of god is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit praise god that's a tall order that's an overwhelming order that when one gets out of kilter it brings everything out of kilter but there was one who got out of kilter and that was eve and it moved everything out of kilter but it's all right god had a plan nothing was outside of his knowledge and nothing moved without him knowing and god has had a plan for for millennial upon millennium upon millennium he's had a plan for millions and billions of years before there was a molecule he had a plan before there was stardust before there was an atom he had a book of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and in that book were written those attributes that would be expressed and i was there and god had a plan for my life he has a plan for your life and it seems overwhelming when you see eve let down on one word and look at all the chaos and as long as one subject lets down on one word look it brings chaos the devil gets victory over the word and we look at ourselves and we say it's not possible we're never going to get out of here but oh there's another quote i want to read in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing he would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would felt fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about him they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand he knew he knew eve would fall so before she fell he already had a predestinated church that wouldn't fall he knew the jewish church would fall he knew the first church age would fall he knew every constant subsequent church age would fall he already knew it all so he had to predestinate one that was predestinated not to fall friends we're going to overcome in this day not by willpower not by strength amen not by my but by his spirit saith the lord he has predestinated a church that won't fall and in order to keep her from falling he said i'm going to do something i haven't done yet i'm going to come down myself amen and i'm going to unite with that bride and the headship coming to the body and i'm going to keep whispering love secrets in her ear to keep her on the straight path because this is reconciling heaven and earth we're bringing a harmony back to everything that fell out of harmony and the harmony between bride and this christ is bringing a harmony back to the heavenly realms friends god is using this journey through this earth to reconcile heaven and earth there's more going on than meets the eye there's more going on in our lives than we realize amen in this message is coming this day to lift us out of the chicken yard to get us up above all the carnal things and out of laodicea so that we can fly high through the open door and see the plan of god and so that we could surrender to his plan day by day say how do we have this kind of victory every day choose the word in every circumstance brother brenham said eve was tested by the word this bride will be tested by the word you'll come to situations where you have to choose this way or that way and friends the choices in my life are getting so very complicated it used to be so easy don't go to that place don't go to that place but now we're having choices when your brothers and sisters are making choices that aren't the word and you love them and your family your own desire you have all these things and you have to stay with the word and it gets so complicated because this is a good brother and i love them this is a good sister and i love them and i know they love the lord but they're doing this but brother bam taught us not to do that and i've got to take my stand on the word i'm telling you it's getting so complicated that you've got to lose filio love and go to agape love and say i don't understand it i love you my brother i love you my sister i still believe you're my brother and sister but this is wrong according to the word and i'm going to stay with the word this bride will be tested by the word and she's predestinated not to fall she's going to make the harder choice she's going to go the harder way for this is my choice saith the lord you think that was just for brother branham that's for you too friends he said you've chosen the harder way the narrow road the harder path you did so of your own choosing that's god's program god's program is he can predestinate but he can't force he can't take away free moral agency he can predestinate but he knows what life is in you and he can bring a spirit to quicken that life and in that life there's certain dna there's certain characteristics or certain attributes that will express because he planted that seed and he knows what's in that seed and under the right conditions it will express it's not what you and i do it's what we surrender ourselves to the life is already there it's been quickened by the spirit and by the spirit it's leading that life into a full manifestation you already have what you need to overcome we just have to keep surrendering to the word god is going to have this bride overcome all those tricky circumstances all those difficult decisions and those hard conversations and i'm telling you they're difficult they're not getting easier they're getting harder they're not getting it it's it's grieving through the to your soul it's so grieving to have to make these choices amen but this bride will not let down on the word she will stay with the word by predestination and i say thank god that he's told us what our lot is in this day it's not going to be easier and it's not going to get easier it's going to get harder but god's predestinated a bride to stay with the word and in staying with the word when your obedience is full amen he'll bring judgment to all disobedience he knew eve would fall but he predestinated a bride that wouldn't fall because before the foundation of the world before he made a world before he made a lucifer he already had a plan and that plan was going to express god in the fullness of his character and the fullness of his nature and at the end of that plan he's going to reconcile back all things to its original harmony and lucifer will be annihilated and spoken word is the original seed the prophet of god says now christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil you believe that i can't explain all this i'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the high places so you won't stay too long christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right you all believe that what was he god's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same that's our job the body is to do the same because the body is head and body together that right if christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was that's right and the church of the word born of the word virgin burned from the virgin born from the word not a denomination now a virgin born from the word the way the body operates is by the head he was manifest to destroy the works of the devil his body is manifested do the same but she'll do so by being under the headship of the head which is this word brother brahm says in the pyramid church age he says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time that is a sure word friends that came when an angel of the lord said pick up your pen and write that wasn't brother branham's words that was god using him to write out a message to the church and that message to the church is god will do the work that he saved for this specific time and he will do it through the bride amen what he needs is he needs a people on this earth that says i love you and i will surrender to that and whatever you say is what i desire to do i will choose to die i will choose to surrender i will i will make the difficult choice like he told brother branham he says you chose to narrow way you chose the harder path you did so of your own choosing he says it was the precise and correct choice for it is my way it was god's predestinated way god already had a plan he already saw it he already knew what that prophet would do but he could not force that prophet to do that that man as a man had to make his own choice but when he made that choice it was the precise and correct choice and it was god's way i said god you've ordained us to make the harder choice amen but we must do so of our own choosing say god i choose your word i choose to let it have preeminence in me i choose to let it live in me oh god i surrender to this word i want the harmony restored i want the work of reconciliation to finish when the last seed comes in amen the bride will go i want to be a voice that's calling be ye reconciled to god i want god amen to finish the work that he left for this specific time i wanted to do it through me i want him to do it through me because i chose the harder way i chose the narrow path i did it of my own choosing because i wanted to because all i wanted to do was please him and i don't even have that desire of my own natural birth i have that desire because of the seed that's on the inside of me it's all god working his plan it's all gone i mean god knew this before the foundation of the world and god had it all planned down and it's all god every part of it is god and this part that i'm playing is god i say god help me not to stand in your way but let you play your part faithfully turn to romans 16. i'd like to finish with this verse as the musicians come blake as you come romans 16. verse 20 and the god of peace shall bruce satan under your feet shortly this is part of god's plan this is his plan for reconciling all things this is his plan for finishing the work that jesus didn't finish in his earthly ministry but he will now do in and through the bride this is part of that plan and it's going to be god who does the work not you and i and the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly and i'll say do you make the choice choose the word just choose the word brother branham says in the first seal he quotes revelation 12 7-9 satan that spirit the devil which is up there now accuser of our brethren all right the church is taken up and satan is cast out when the church goes up satan comes down brother branham is singing a song and the message god's only provided place of worship all the way at the end he's singing a song he's singing i've got a father over yonder and he sings the first part of the song and he comes to the second bride he says some bright day i'll go and see him and he repeats that line he says and then he goes oh won't it be a happy meeting won't it be word goes to word meeting when the bride goes up word by word oh friends i want to be going up word by word as god reveals the word step higher step higher and put pressure on the devil may he be dropping lower all the time until that great day that last predestinated seed comes in the church goes and when she goes up he comes down because he's lost his position say god help me to keep your word but i believe it with all that's in me i don't have any ability in myself amen if it's left to me i'll do the same thing eve did i'll do the same thing the first church did but all what satisfies my heart is i believe that message that god gave us that he has predestinated a bride that won't fall because he promised he wouldn't let her fall we've seen a manifestation like nobody has ever seen before friends we have we've got it on tapes we've got a document we got on video no other age had the opportunity to have this display of vindication for the word that you and i have seen god did that for a reason no other age had a cloud picture that they could hang on their house and turn sideways and see that that's the headship coming to the body so that we would know what day we're in so that we would have the confidence just to trust him if he did all that can he keep this part of the word too amen if he could show his coming in the clouds amen if he could if he could if he could reveal the mysteries if he could open the seals through a prophetic gift if he could do all that and show me his willingness to keep his word and what he'll go through to keep his word and display it to you and i won't he keep this word too because this attribute that's down to me is part of that word and must be reconciled back amen it must come back into its original harmony amen and i i can believe that god will do it not by my ability but by the spirit that he has set his bride in this day by the headship that is united with the bride if i can just surrender to that he can do all things i can do all things through christ who strengthens me it's not just an earthly walk you're not just hearing an earthly walk god is doing a work and he's he's fixing the problem on earth and in heaven your life is part of that plan your manifestation you're revealing the word is part of that great plan of redemption and i say god by your grace let me play my part because i surrender to you let's all stand friends i said wednesday it's not about church it's not about a good sunday service it's not about just a good this or a good day it's so much bigger than that all of that's part of it but if we get down into those things we've missed what god's doing in this day it's about god reconciling all things and to himself it's about god's plan of redemption to bring back and to bring a true harmony and i say god opened my eyes to see the bigger picture because if i can see the bigger picture you'll give me faith to walk every day of my life and harmony with your word let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for this word almighty god god we're so thankful god that you have sent a prophet in this day to peel back this book lord just so we could see that you've had a plan from long before the foundation of the world before i come into this manifestation before i face the trials and troubles that i face you already had a plan and in your plan i've already overcome and in your plan i'm already part of that victory and in your plan you've already used me to overcome the devil oh god let me get in tune with your plan let me get dialed into your plan so that every obstacle and every day amen becomes lord not not the devastation of my life but it becomes you working something out in your plan so that i can have faith just to take you at your word and move forward and trust you for what you've promised to do in this hour and what you promised to do through me god bless your people lift us higher lord let us move beyond the carnal into the supernatural let us see lord that there's so much more going on than what meets the eye and our lives here are so much more important than we realize for every attribute must be expressed and every attribute must express the word god help us to express our attribute in this hour help us to stay with your word god we love you for what you showed to us we love you for what you're doing we asked god that you would continue the work for your faithful to finish the work that you've begun we surrender to you lord i surrender afresh to you take me and use me i recognize lord this is bigger than me this is bigger than my little brain this is bigger than what my eyes can see or my little brain can perceive it's so much bigger than that and i just want to yield myself to you so that you could do the greater works through me how i love you lord and i ask for your blessing over this congregation help us to stay true to this word at all cost help us bring honor and glory to your name in jesus christ's name we pray amen bless your sin will more than ever lord i love you more than ever before lord i need you lord i want to tell you i love you now more than ever [Music] brother chuck if you'd like to go on around back we'll have your baptism here in a few minutes also to remind you that we have communion service today so if you're able to make it we'll be back here at 4 pm to have communion and feet washing say god bless you i love you all i'm so thankful to be serving with you at this time there's no other time to be alive for me i was predestinated for this hour doesn't make it easy on my flesh it's not easy on the flesh it's hard but something in me knows i was born for this day i was born for this hour and i want to give my whole heart i don't want to run scared i don't wanna i don't wanna wring my hands i just wanna be all that he's called me to be in this hour i wanna trust him like i've never trusted him before and stand in the face of all opposition and just say god your word is true and every man's word is alive and i trust you praise god let's sing the song again lord i love you more than ever before lord i need you [Music] i love you now more than ever before more than ever lord i love you [Music] more than ever lord i need you more than ever this is a wonderful day for the williams family i don't know if you've had a chance to meet them or not but they've been attending here for several weeks and they want this they intend to make this their home church they've been in contact with the message for several years and for several years i've been listening but it's having an effect on brother chuck and he wants to surrender completely to the lord and he believes that the father is drawing him and he wants to take this step of water baptism in jesus name so this is a tremendous victory and we're just happy to have them here and happy to be able to participate in this day with them and celebrate and rejoice in what the lord is doing and i'd encourage you to get to meet them and shake their hands and have some fellowship because they have a wonderful testimony of what god is doing brother chuck because you love the lord jesus christ and
