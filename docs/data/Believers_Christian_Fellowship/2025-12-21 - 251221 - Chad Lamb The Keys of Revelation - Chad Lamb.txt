Oh, Father, we love you, Lord Jesus. We're so grateful, Lord, to be standing here again. For God, we believe that by your grace, you've gathered us once more because you desire to speak to us. And God, you've opened your word in this hour and you're constantly, Lord, bringing forth revelation of yourself and unfolding, Lord, that we might see you, God. And I pray, God, you give us eyes to see and ears to hear all that you want to share with us this morning. And may you be glorified, Lord. May you be the great one amongst us this morning, God, for we love to serve you. We desire to see you. We long to worship you and praise your name. And God, we just appreciate the privilege of gathering like this and we love you so much. We ask God now that as we yield ourselves to your hand that you would come and take this vessel completely under your control, Lord, and may you speak your words of eternal life. And may that word drop into our souls, Lord. And may it produce all that you intend for it to produce. For your word that goes out from you will not return void, but it will accomplish what you sent it forth to accomplish. and may it accomplish a work in each one of us. We pray. We love you. We ask you would bless us, Lord, as we look into your word, God. May you just break it to us yourself. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all this morning. Certainly good to see you here. Amen. And before we turn on our Bibles, I just want to remind you that uh this is Christmas week. So, I want to say merry Christmas. God bless you. We hope that you have a wonderful week with your family. And instead of the Wednesday midweek service this week, we have it on Tuesday. So, I don't want anybody to forget that. I've already forgot. Somebody asked me last week, "What are your plans Tuesday?" I said, "I'm free Tuesday. I have no plans." I said, "Well, wait a minute. No, we got service. I'll be preaching." Amen. Amen. So, we'll see you here. Those who are able to make it on Tuesday, those who are not able, we know that some will be traveling. They have obligations. We're going to say, "God bless you. May you have a wonderful Christmas time." Amen. And also, we've got several visitors today. And I just saw Matthew. God bless you, brother Matthew. It's good to have you back. Amen. I'm glad you come back for a visit. Uh, Amen. Also, we have a brother Simon and sister Kesa from uh Kamita from Pennsylvania, but they're originally from Poland. So, this is brother Nathaniel Kamita's cousin. Amen. Who's come over from Poland to visit him. So, he's brought a lot of visitors our way. God bless you, brother. It's been wonderful. Amen. And brother Simon's wife is actually a daughter to a good friend of mine in Poland. Brother Robert Fischer who's a pastor there and we preached at his church. So it is a small world. Amen. So God bless you. It's good to have you here as well. And then brother Jeremy Sanders told me there's a brother JD visiting from Milwaukee. So and any other visitors, we want you to feel very welcome and at home and we're glad to have you here with us this morning. Amen. While we're standing, let's turn to the book of Matthewap 11. And as you turn to Matthew 11, I I want to tell you about a present I got Friday night. Amen. I got a little gift. I got a t-shirt. Amen. So, you can already guess what's on the t-shirt. Amen. Olivia Wholesapple made a t-shirt for me and the whole sapple clan brought it by. And the t-shirt says, "I am Altos Genos, chosen generation." So, praise the Lord. I told her, I said, "You better make a bunch of them. Those could be a hot commodity. So, I'm going to wear it someday. But it was nice of them and I I didn't expect anybody to actually make a t-shirt. I'm going have to be careful what I say. Amen. But it was nice and we certainly appreciated it. And it's still good. Amen. It's still a good idea. Electto Genos. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's look here at Matthewap 11 verse 25. At that time Jesus answered and said,"I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent, and has revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Amen. if we could pull up the PowerPoint. Uh, I'd like to preach this morning on the keys of Revelation and just take a look at this subject. But I am so glad that it seemed good in the sight of the father to reveal it to babes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that you didn't have to be wise and prudent &gt;&gt; to catch the revel catch the revelation. Amen. Because I might have missed it. I might not have been able to meet the requirements. But there was only one requirement for catching the revelation. And that one requirement is to be a babe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And what kind of a babe? Amen. To be a babe means to be one of God's children. &gt;&gt; And if you're one of God's children, Amen. He's hid it from the wise and pruned. But he has revealed it unto babes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful to be one of those babes. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be by election to be part of God's family. Amen. And I'm glad it seemed good in his sight. This word in here that is uh revealed that revealed them unto babes. This word revealed is apocalyptto. It's used 26 times in the New Testament as reveal. Uh it means to uncover, to lay open what has been veiled or covered up. To disclose or to make bare, to make known, to make manifest, to close disclose what before was unknown. Amen. So when God brings a a revelation, amen, it's an unveiling of that which was covered up. Amen. It's a disclosing of something that's been hidden. And God can bring revelation to the individual. And to the in it always comes to the individual, but to the individual, he uncovers that part that we haven't seen before. &gt;&gt; But then there's always times of great revelation where God comes and uncovers what has never been seen before. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God has done that down through the ages. And each age has had an uncovering, has had an an has had an apocalyptto. Amen. Where God would unveil more of his mystery, more of himself. And the prophets themselves were a greater unveiling all the time. And every church age had another unveiling of his word. And and all down through time, God has been unveiling himself. And he's been revealing himself. And it's always been revealed to a special group of people who are the babes, &gt;&gt; the children of God who's been catching the revelation. And so there's great times of of revelation where God unveils what no one has ever seen before. Jesus said, "Many wise men and righteous men and prophets long to see your day. Long to see the day you see, but they didn't get to see it because it was still under the veil of God's mind and hadn't been unveiled yet." &gt;&gt; Amen. And so those are great times of unveiling where God unveils what was never what had never seen light, what had never been uh opened before. Amen. So that's the general unveiling. But then we have our own personal unveiling where God takes that mystery that's now unveiled in every age and unveils it to us personally. &gt;&gt; So we have to have our own experience of a revelation. Amen. Not just the generational revelation, not just the dispensational revelation, but the dispensational revelation must become a personal revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is also the work of God. When we look at this scripture, he says, it says, "Thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent." &gt;&gt; That means God hid them. &gt;&gt; He hid them. &gt;&gt; And hast revealed them unto babes. That means he revealed them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, who who controls the hiding and the revealing? It's God. &gt;&gt; And and he does it according to his election, according to his predestinated plan. And it seemed good in his sight to do it this way. And I'm glad he did it this way because if he did it based on intellect, if he did it on understanding or ability to study, Amen. I would have missed it. But he did it in a way that I couldn't miss it because he revealed it to the babes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful. God is so good. Let's go to Matthew 16 together. I mean, everybody who's been involved in the message in any time has started here, amen, with the foundation of the church. But we're going to come here in this service and look at this again. Matthew 16:E 13. When Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that I, the son of man, am?" And they said,"Some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets?" He saith unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?" Now listen, I've said this a dozen or more times, and I'll probably say it maybe a hundred more if God gives me breath, but this is to me one of the most critical questions in all the Bible. That's right. &gt;&gt; They were talking about what they had been hearing. &gt;&gt; They the talk the murmur amongst the crowd was some are saying that you're, you know, John the Baptist reincarnated or you're Jeremas or or you're one of the Elias or one of the prophets. But Jesus didn't want to hear what they heard by hearsay. He wanted to know who do you say that I am? What is your revelation? What do you think about it? Because that's what matters to us. Amen. It's got to be an individual personal revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "But whom say ye that I am?" And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." Amen. Peter had heard what everybody else had heard. He had heard all the murmurings and the rumorings and maybe it's this and maybe it's that and and maybe he's this and that. Amen. But all the sudden under inspiration when God brought the question home and said, Jesus said, "Who do you say that I am?" Peter instantly by inspiration of the spirit he said, "Thou art Christ, the son of the living God." All of a sudden, something got put together. Amen. Some scripture came alive. Some reality struck Peter. And Peter didn't say, "I think or maybe or I'm presuming or I heard somebody else said." He just said emphatically, "Thou art Christ, the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; Amen. This isn't something that's taught to you. This is not something that you picked up from hearsay because he could have never made the statement the way he made the statement because he knew there was some debate. There was some murmuring. There was some discussion on who Jesus Christ was. And he had heard everything everybody else heard. And Jesus said, "Whom say whom say men that I am?" And and they're talking about what the talk is on the town, what the word is on the street. Amen. And he heard it all. Amen. But when God put the question, who do you say that I am? He didn't wait for the other disciples to answer. He didn't get the general consensus of the popular vote or what all the inner circles thought. He had something strike his heart and he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt, thou art Christ, the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; That's the power of revelation from the father to obey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to have a intellectual discussion and he doesn't have to go around the horn and he doesn't have to take a vote. Amen. &gt;&gt; He just says by revelation, "Thou art Christ, the son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my father which is in heaven." That's why he could say it the way he said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. So when when Jesus hears Simon make this declaration, he knew Simon didn't get that out of his own study. &gt;&gt; He didn't come to that on his own. He didn't get that by the word on the street or the dialogue with the disciples. He He got that from the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he said, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, unveiled it, opened it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven." And I say that thou art Peter and upon this rock and brother Ben's very careful to tell us that that rock is the rock of spiritual revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was revealed to him the word for his day, who Christ was. and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. That means this foundation for our faith is a foundational understanding of who Christ is, who the word is in our day. Amen. And that understanding puts the church on a foundation that she cannot be moved in the gates of hell though they rage against her will never prevail over revelation. &gt;&gt; Never. It can prevail over study. It can prevail over intellectualism. It can prevail over theology. Amen. But the gates of hell cannot prevail over a church that's founded on the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And then he told Peter, "And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom." This is an amazing statement. "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whosoever and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. To me, this is an amazing statement that he takes Peter and when we know Peter's background and we understand who Peter is, Peter is an illiterate, uneducated fisherman. &gt;&gt; Are we on the same page? &gt;&gt; He's a nobody from nowhere. And I hate to say it that way because we love Peter, but Peter would be just a common man &gt;&gt; who we call a common labor in our day. Amen. and and he didn't have anything special about him. No education, no training, no particularly good understanding or intellect or wisdom. Wasn't able to sign his name. Brother Venom said wasn't able to read. &gt;&gt; But God says, "I'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven." &gt;&gt; I mean, this isn't the keys to your new car, friends. This is the keys to the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; And who is he entrusting the keys to? He's giving them to the uneducated, illiterate fisherman. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who happens to have a bit of a hot temper and goes off halfcocked most of the time. &gt;&gt; Who's going to need some correction even after this and he's going to need to he's going to need a new birth experience. He's going to need to be reigned in a bit. Amen. But but God, Amen. at this statement, at this revelation from the father. Amen. He was able to say, "I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." And all of a sudden, there was a tremendous power placed in the hands of Peter, and a tremendous responsibility placed into his hands. Amen. And Peter, listen, Peter half the time doesn't have a clue what's going on or what he should be doing. And many times he's acting the wrong way and taking the wrong decision and coming to the wrong conclusions. &gt;&gt; So God didn't entrust this to a a man with inherent wisdom. &gt;&gt; He didn't give it to the man with the mildest temperament. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The one who always makes the best decisions. He didn't even go to the ones who most mo most political cuz he surely wasn't although he was a little political when they were trying to find out who was going to be the greatest and he was in that debate too. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He he didn't give these keys and this responsibility of loosing and binding the power to loose and bind. He didn't give it to a man that was eloquent because Peter was not. He didn't give it to a man that was educated because Peter was not. He didn't give it to one who had life figured out because Peter did not. He gave the keys to one who could get a revelation from the father. &gt;&gt; And Peter was the first one to get this revelation of all the disciples. And when he declared it, Jesus says, "You're the one who's going to get the keys." &gt;&gt; Look at what the prophet says here. Says, he said, "Go baptize in the name of father, son, and holy ghost." So it could be revealed because Jesus knowed that Peter had the gift of revelations. He knowed because it had already been revealed to him by the spirit above. And when God sees that a man can receive revelations from above, he can trust that man and do something with him. When it's revealed to him, because he said, "No man can reveal this but his father." God is the only one who can reveal it. And he knew Peter was in contact with the spirit. &gt;&gt; God could trust. Amen. God, when God sees that man can receive revelation from above, he can trust that man to do something with him. God. Listen, God is not looking for our ability and our education and our good conduct and all of these things. God's not looking for the mildest temperament and the most persuasive speaker and the nicest PER THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD'S AFTER. AMEN. BECAUSE THERE'S PILES of those in the world. The grabag of life has put genetic uh ingredients together. Amen. And then you get more combinations than Skittles had and more than BaskinRobins. Amen. You get all kinds. And you get some that are super wise and intellectual and smooth. Amen. They can they can seem to put things together, but that's not what he's looking for. He's not looking for what genetics can put together. He's looking for that one that can receive a spiritual revelation from the father. And that's the one he can trust. &gt;&gt; THOUGH HE'S HOTTEMPERED, THOUGH HE SPOUTS off at the mouth, though he makes mistakes, though he's going to have to be corrected. Amen. THAT THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO GOD. GOD CAN FIX ALL OF THAT. AMEN. HIS blood is enough. The atonement was good enough. Amen. God can bring correction and education and training to his child. He has A ROD OF CORRECTION. He can fix that. But there's one thing he can't fix AND HE CAN'T FIX somebody that's born without a receiver for revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's predestinated that was determined before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; So who's he looking to work with? The one that can receive revelation from the father. &gt;&gt; And God can trust a man like that. Brother Brandham says, "For Peter was given the key to the kingdom, saying, "Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind it in heaven." And what does a key do? It unlocks something, the mystery. &gt;&gt; It unlocks something, the mystery. So Peter was going to unlock a mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So opening the uh the key to heaven, Amen, was going to open a mystery. And this same key that would open a mystery. So in order to open the door to heaven, the kingdom of heaven is opened by a re revelation of a mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then there's also power within that unlocking to loose or to bind. &gt;&gt; They go together. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever thou shalt loose shall be loosed in heaven. That whatsoever th bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. So it all goes together. In Matthew 28, he says, "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you. And lo, I'm with you all we, even to the end of the world. Amen." And so God here as Jesus Christ when he's getting ready to leave, he's already been crucified. He's already resurrected. He's giving final instructions. And he tells them to go therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. And this statement is intentional by by Christ. Amen. It's intentionally worded the way it's worded. &gt;&gt; Amen. for a reason. &gt;&gt; Because you know when I first came to the message and I was believing water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and was baptized. Amen. I believed it. I had a revelation. I knew it was true. And I came back to the scripture over and over and I said, "If Jesus would have just said it &gt;&gt; different, I could show all my friends. I could take it back TO MY FORMER PASTOR. I COULD SHOW THEM ALL of these things." But he intentionally said it the way he said it for a reason. Amen. Because revelation is only for the babes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And so he it he it he didn't want it to be intellectual. Repeat after me Christianity. God never wanted a repeat after me prayer. Christianity. Say what I say and say you believe what I say and if you say what I say and claim to believe what I say, you're saved. He never wanted that. That's nowhere in the scriptures. That's not salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. is based on revelation, divine revelation from the father. So he intentionally says it this way. And you could say, well, he made it difficult. I think he made it easy. &gt;&gt; It depends on which end you land whether you receive the revelation or don't. If you receive the revelation, it's easy. I know there's only name is singular, not plural. There's only one name that encompasses the father and the son and the holy ghost. And when the fullness of the godhead was poured into a body, he took an earthly name and that was the one name of the father, son, and holy ghost on earth. And that name is the Lord Jesus Christ. To me, it's simple. &gt;&gt; NOT BY EDUCATION, BUT BY REVELATION. AMEN. It's complicated when I have to DO IT BY STUDY and I have to do it by hermeneutics and I have to go into the Greek and I have to understand all of this. Listen, that's not how God wanted us to understand the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be by divine revelation. So he said it intentionally. The instructions were attention intentional. I can't remember who was here not long ago and and said, "Amen. If you have to believe everything by verbatim quote, then what is Peter doing misquing Jesus Christ?" &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he says, "Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." And but but that's not what Jesus told him. Jesus didn't say those exact words. &gt;&gt; So you said he said something different than Jesus. I argue he didn't say anything different than Jesus. &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, HE DIDN'T QUOTE IT EXACT." I THINK HE QUOTED it exact. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By revelation, he quoted the scriptures perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. He says, "Now watch now the next." He says, "And thou art Simon and I give unto thee." Because he had the spiritual revealed truth. That's the reason he knowed the difference between father, son, holy ghost, and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He had a spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; That's why Peter could say what he said. He says, "Now there's three races of people on the earth. If you believe the Bible, there's only three races. Ham, Sham, and Japheth people, Jew, Gentile, and Samaritan. Peter with the keys at Pentecost opened it to the Jews. Philip went down and preached and baptized them down in Samaria. But Peter came down and laid hands on them. They received the Holy Ghost and the house of Cornelius. Then he had the keys that opened it to these three peoples. So God gave him the keys of the kingdom to open access to the kingdom of heaven. Amen. To all the people of the earth. Amen. And so Peter was instrumental in doing that. The day of Pentecost was the first use of the keys. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the first opening. And that opening was when Peter stood up and said, "These men are not drunk as you suppose, but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel." And he starts to tie together the prophecy with the fulfillment of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. I want you to see this. Amen. Amen. And it was Peter's job. Amen. To open by the by by the by the keys of revelation. He was there to open unto them the mystery. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And as he opened the mystery, the key opening the mystery to them that this is what the prophet Joel talked about. This is what the prophets were pointing to. This is who Jesus Christ was whom you with wicked hands had taken and crucified. He was the Lord of glory. He was the son of David. He was the prophecy being fulfilled. He was all of this. And what was he doing? He was revealing the mystery. And revealing the mystery was turning the key to the door and opening the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. But not everybody walked through the door. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then when Philip went down to the Samaritans, Philip was preaching, Amen. to the Samaritans the same thing that Peter preached on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a different message. It was the same message. And he baptized the same way that Peter baptized on the day of Pentecost. So he preached the message and baptized. And they were only waiting for the one with the keys of the kingdom to come and lay hands on them. And they received the Holy Ghost because receiving the Holy Ghost is receiving the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now he went down there and then he went to the house of Cornelius. And in the house of Cornelius, Amen. while he was preaching the word. Oh, it's so beautiful, friends. Listen. He he he goes by the way of the Jews. Amen. And he goes to the Jews. And to the Jews, he breaks down the prophecy and tells them this and that. And then they say what we do. And he says, "Do this and you'll receive the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Philip goes to the Samaritans and brings them the word and they receive it and they're baptized and he comes down and he lays hands on them and they receive the Holy Ghost. But when he goes to the Gentiles, amen, the preaching of the word produces everything for the Gentiles. They start speaking in tongues. Amen. They start showing the same sign that they showed at Pentecost under the preaching of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Bible is so perfect, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he says, well, hey, listen. Hey, listen. There's a formula to this. Amen. And you still need to be baptized in Jesus name. Amen. Who can forbid water to them that is received? Amen. The gift the same as we has received it. Amen. And so then he takes them and baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that's still the revelation of what they've received. They receive the spirit of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And who was he? He was God made flesh. He was the word for their day. He was the fulfillment of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all three people types receive the same revelation &gt;&gt; and the same baptism. But I just love the way that they receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be like those in the house of &gt;&gt; Cornelius. &gt;&gt; I want to be healed by the preaching of the word. I want to be delivered by the preaching of the word. I want to be born again by the preaching of the word. Filled with the spirit by the pre everything by the preaching of the word because that's gentile faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message investments, he says, "Simon Peter, we might speak of him a moment because he was mentioned this morning and one of the apostles and the one that had the keys to the kingdom." In other words, the knowledge how to unlock the doors to the kingdom. And we spoke of that last night, the key locked the door and unlocked it. And we heard of that last night, the original foundation. So the key the key was the mystery &gt;&gt; and the key can lock the door or unlock the door &gt;&gt; because a key can do both. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When in the Bible when we go let's go to Acts chapter 2. Go with me to Acts chapter 2. Let's just jump over there for just a minute. In Acts chapter 2, you know, the rushing mighty wind came, the licks of fire was divided on each one. They began to speak with tongues and run into the street glorifying God. And all that was there gathered from all the nations. Every man heard in his own language what they were saying. Notable miracle to get the attention of the Jews. And then when their attention was gathered, he stands up and starts preaching modern events made clear by prophecy. I think that would be a good title to his first sermon. &gt;&gt; What you're seeing is what Joel said. What just happened in Jerusalem is what David said and what the what the the prophets have said. Amen. And all of this is explained. And as he explains it, listen, the formula that he's giving, the the mystery he's unlocking, the key that he's turning, Amen. for them. It doesn't become a formula by which you can you can you can replicate it intellectually &gt;&gt; where you can just say, "Well, I'm going to preach and and then you say, okay, and then I will take and baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then you're going to get the Holy Ghost." It's not like that. That's not the way it was on the day of Pentecost. They said, "What should we do?" And he said, "This is what you do. First, you repent." &gt;&gt; Amen. And who who was repenting? Were they prostitutes and harlots? &gt;&gt; No, sir. They were gathering for the feast of Pentecost. They were devout Jews from all over the place coming back together for a religious feast to worship God according to the religion they had been raised in, according to the truth that they had been raised in. &gt;&gt; But now there was a dispensational change. &gt;&gt; And now he's preaching. Amen. He's opening the mystery of the dispensational change. And now he's saying, "Repent," which means change your mind. Turn from this. This was to lead you to this. Now you've got to turn from this to the new dispensational change. Amen. To the fulfillment of the prophecy, WHICH IS CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; And even that was not just an intellectual exercise. If you go with me uh to verse 32, I'm just going to back up and catch a little bit of his sermon. He says, "This Acts 2 uh Acts 2:32, this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this which you now see and hear. For David has not ascended into the heavens, but he saith himself, "The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand until I make thy foes thy foottools." He's preaching Old Testament prophecy. And then verse 36, therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ. &gt;&gt; He is the king. He is the Messiah. This is him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now listen verse 37. I think this is the most important one. &gt;&gt; Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do? Listen, to me, this is the most critical part because there has to be somewhere for the fulfillment of prophecy, the mystery to strike. &gt;&gt; And where does it strike? It struck their heart. &gt;&gt; And they were pricricked in their heart. There was some that day who were not pricricked in their heart. &gt;&gt; This is not about going through the motions. This is not about copy and paste. This is not about repeat after me. This is about when the disposational change was manifest was preached and when he was declared to them the day that they were living in with the fulfillment prophecy for that day something inside of them began to jump and they were pricricked in their heart. THEY KNEW INSIDE THAT WHAT Peter was saying was the truth. &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAID NOW WHAT DO WE DO? &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T LIKE WHAT DO I need to do to go to heaven? I'll do what it takes to go to heaven. Give me the process. It wasn't that kind of thing friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were hearing the word preached. And when they heard the word for their hour priest and the fullness of the revelation, the mystery, the key opening up the the the kingdom of heaven TO THEM, SOMETHING INSIDE of them began to move. And they were pricked in their heart. And they said to Peter AND THE BRETHREN, "WHAT DO WE DO NOW?" &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE TRUTH. AMEN. WE COME TO THIS FEAST. WE COME, WE'VE BEEN FULFILLING ALL THE LAW OF MOSES. We've been looking forward TO THIS DAY FOR GENERATIONS FROM GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS. NOW, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TOUCHING ME IN MY SOUL. IT'S BRINGING A REACTION OUT OF ME. NOW, WHAT DO I DO? AND HE SAYS, REPENT. CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT ALL OF THIS AND COME TO THE OPEN WORD. COME TO THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BE BAPTIZED in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT STILL WORKS TODAY. THE SAME EXACT WAY, THE SAME EXACT FORMULA. NOT AS A FORMULA LIKE THE BAPTISTS DO. TAKE YOU THROUGH the old Roman road, read to you a couple scriptures, get you to agree with it, and repeat after me PRAYER AND YOU'RE SAVED. NOT THAT KIND OF PRAYER, NOT KIND OF SALVATION, BUT THE KIND FROM THE BIBLE, THE KIND FROM PENTECOST WHEN WHEN YOU PREACH THE PROPHECY FULFILLED IN YOUR DAY, THE WORD FOR THIS DISPENSATIONAL CHANGE THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW, PREACHING CHRIST ALIVE IN OUR DAY. AMEN. TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THEM. THIS IS THE TRUTH. THIS IS THE DAY. NOT AS OUR FATHERS, BUT GOD HAS BROUGHT SOMETHING TO PASS IN OUR DAY. AND WHEN THEY HEAR THAT, THEY'RE PRICRICKED IN THEIR HEART. WHAT DO YOU DO THEN? REPENT FROM YOUR DENOMINATIONAL UNDERSTANDING. REPENT FROM YOUR WORLDLY IDEAS AND COME TO THIS JESUS CHRIST, THE truth revealed before you &gt;&gt; AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. AND YOU SHALL WITHOUT ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT, WITHOUT ANY QUESTION, receive the baptism of the HOLY GHOST. THAT FORMULA STILL WORKS today &gt;&gt; if we approach it the same way &gt;&gt; and if it comes by the same results in effect. &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Praise God. In Mark 16:15, he says, "And he said unto them, go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized." Not he that's baptized, but he that believeth and is baptized. Believeth what? &gt;&gt; The gospel. &gt;&gt; What's the gospel? The good news. &gt;&gt; Is God still have good news? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does he keep giving us more good news? &gt;&gt; Or do we have to just stay with the old good news &gt;&gt; or do we have today good news? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we should preach the good news today &gt;&gt; to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. So the same key can lock or unlock. &gt;&gt; Same key. &gt;&gt; It can lock or unlock to those who were pricricked in their heart and could believe it and unlocked the kingdom of heaven to them. To those who disagreed and didn't like it and disbelieved and walked away, the door was locked. Even Paul and Barnabas when they were preaching to the mixed multitude of Gentiles and Jews in their missionary journey, they preached, but then the Jews, they they created a stir and they began to speak evil of those things, contradicting the things that Paul and Barnabas said. And Paul, they waxed bold and they said, "Seeing how you ha have refused or you count yourself unworthy of everlasting life." &gt;&gt; To them, the door was locked. &gt;&gt; Because you count yourself unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And did the Bible say the Gentiles rejoiced? Yes. &gt;&gt; And did it say that all the Gentiles believed? &gt;&gt; No. It said those that were ordained unto eternal life believed. &gt;&gt; They were pricricked in their heart. They were rejoicing because they were ordained to eternal life and they believed. So the message that Paul and Barnabas brought to one group was an unlocking to another group was a locking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the God of this evil age, I don't have the quote for the overhead, but I I have it here with me. And the god of this evil age, he says, notice Cain. He didn't want no blood sacrifice. He come down and offered the fruit or the fields of beauty upon his altar. Very religious, done everything just exactly like Abel done. Offered a sacrifice, fell down before God in worship, obedient in every way, but without the revelation of the word. And the word was from the beginning God's plan. But God revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that was right. Not religion, not an altar, not belonging to church, not making a sacrifice, not being sincere, but by the revelation of the word of God. What was God's plan for salvation from the beginning? Revelation. Revelation of the word. went all the way back in the beginning in the book of Genesis when when Cain and Abel came to worship God, Brother Benham said they both loved God. &gt;&gt; And they both desired to worship God. &gt;&gt; So you can't just base it off, well I love God, they love God. We love God. Cain loved God. &gt;&gt; They want to go to church. They want to worship. They want to Cain wanted to worship. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All the Jews who rejected Jesus wanted to worship. &gt;&gt; They went through great efforts &gt;&gt; to keep the law and to worship according to the commandments. &gt;&gt; But they didn't have what that what it took to believe. &gt;&gt; So it's got to be something more than just religious effort. &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than just religious zeal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than just the effort we put in. Although we should put effort. Absolutely. without a doubt. But but but that alone didn't work for Cain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because Cain didn't have a revelation of the word of what it took to bring an atonement. He had no revelation. And so he was trying by a works program and by religion and by a beautiful altar. He was trying to appease God with with beauty and with work and with all that he could do to produce the best he could to appease the wrath of God and find and for God to find pleasure with him and acceptance in the eyes of God. And God did not accept his sacrifice. That's right. &gt;&gt; But Abel, Amen. without a lot of effort, without a lot of religious work, without a lot of intellectualism, he just caught a revelation and an understanding of what happened in Eden and what was wrong with the blood and that there had to be a blood covering. And he caught it by revelation. And listen, revelation doesn't take months and months to catch. I mean, you can catch it in less than a fraction of a second. I don't even think time can account because it's an eternal thing with God. And all of a sudden, like a flash of lightning, your eyes are open and you see something you've never seen before. Amen. That's by God. Amen. God did that. AND GOD IN A FLASH, AMEN, Abel knew all of a sudden what it was. How can I appease God? How can I How can I find an atonement FOR MY SIN? WHY AM I OUT OF THE GARDEN? WHY AM I wearing these clothes? Why Why is everything falling apart? WHAT'S WRONG? AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, IN A FLASH, HE REALIZED what happened in the garden. And he knew it had to be the shedding of blood for the remission of sins. There had to be an atonement of blood &gt;&gt; cuz the problem is in the blood. And so now what he comes and offers, LISTEN, HE DOESN'T offer a prettier sacrifice. He doesn't offer a more expensive sacrifice. He doesn't offer more religious zeal. What he OFFERS BACK TO GOD IS A PRODUCT OF the revelation that he has in his heart. AND GOD SAW HE GETS IT. HE UNDERSTANDS. He knows the dispensation. He knows WHAT WENT WRONG. AND GOD ACCEPTED HIS sacrifice and ACCEPTED ABEL AND REJECTED CAIN. And it had nothing to do WITH EFFORT OR WORK or merit or it didn't have anything to do with morality. It didn't have anything to do with any of those things. &gt;&gt; IT WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE EXPRESSION of his revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS GOD'S PLAN from the beginning was the word, the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That's why that's why God could give the keys of the kingdom to an illiterate fisherman. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if it was going to be some religious thing uh like a system and a form of worship and if it was going to be something that would take great effort and intellectualism and a theology book and and all of this, he would have needed to get somebody who could read. I mean, that would be like step one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because you could at least write out the program &gt;&gt; because on this holiday you got to do this and and on this day you got to do this and you got to bring this kind of sacrifice and you got to do this thing and that thing. If that was the way God was going to do it, Amen. He would have needed somebody who could read or write. But but that's not what he wanted. Amen. God wanted Amen. to have a a a divine revelation of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he didn't give the keys, Amen, to the to the most capable, Amen, intellectually, humanistically speaking, but he gave the keys to somebody that already proved they could get divine revelation from the father. &gt;&gt; And he could trust him with those keys. &gt;&gt; That's why our prophet had a seventh grade education. &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, thank God." He had to entrust somebody that could operate by divine revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it. So many times, Brother Bennett is mispronouncing something in the Bible. He's saying the wrong word or the wrong name or even quoting the wrong scripture. And I love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I absolutely love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God didn't need, Amen, a polished scholar to bring his message. He needed somebody who could receive revelation from the father. &gt;&gt; He didn't have a polished scholar in Peter and he didn't need one in this day. Amen. And the one polished scholar he had was the Saul who became Paul. And he had to go beat out all of his intellectualism and all of his knowledge out of him and get him to forsake it and count it as dung and wish he hadn't had it. &gt;&gt; So that he could use him. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So to one it's locked, to one it's unlocked. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so thankful to me it's unlocked &gt;&gt; because I didn't do one blessed thing to unlock it. &gt;&gt; I didn't earn it. &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve it. &gt;&gt; I didn't pay for it. I wasn't a good enough boy. I wasn't religious enough. I didn't have enough zeal or fervor. I had nothing that would give me enough merit for God to give me a revelation of his word. He did it solely by grace &gt;&gt; because I'm a babe. &gt;&gt; If God has given you revelation of his word and indicates one thing for sure, you're a babe. &gt;&gt; You're one of his babes. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says, "The Bible said that Peter was an ignorant and unlearned man. He couldn't even sign his own name, but it pleased God to give him the keys to the kingdom because he seen the Messiah and noted his evidence and fell at his feet and recognized him as the Messiah. He believed the word and and and thou art Peter, I say unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I'll build my church. Not upon Peter, not upon Jesus, but upon his spiritual revelation of who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same thing he did Abel. Abel by faith offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain. Both boys offered. Both boys prayed. Both boys built an altar. Both boys worshiped the same God. One was accepted and the other one turned down because by revelation Abel saw it wasn't fruits or apples that brought us out of the Garden of Eden. It was blood and he offered blood and God received it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Jews asked Jesus one day, "What can we do to do the works of God?" He said, "Well, keep all the feast and take care of the widows and tithe and do a little more offering." He said, "Believe on him whom thou has sent." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What can you do? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Believe the one I I sent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; With the revelation of the word for your hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. What does it mean to believe the one whom he has sent? Why did God ever send a prophet? &gt;&gt; God always sent a prophet to give them the word for the dispensation they were in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He always sent a prophet to give them the current present tense truth of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And what can we do that we might do the works of God? &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; On what? the one that God sent with the current present tense truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Receive the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Abel could do is he could receive the word. Cain could not. Even when Cain was given instructions, &gt;&gt; why don't you just do like Abel, your brother? Won't it be well with thee? He couldn't do it. Amen. It angered him. It upset him. He had no understanding. He didn't know why. He couldn't see any reason why Abel would be accepted and he wouldn't be accepted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because he didn't understand revelation. &gt;&gt; Listen, I can't explain to you. I can't give you any good reason why my worship would be accepted and somebody else's would not. &gt;&gt; Because it's not like I do better. &gt;&gt; If you ever hear me sing, you'd realize that based on my merit alone, God shouldn't accept my praise in song. &gt;&gt; But I'm singing from a heart of revelation. The words mean something to me. I understand what I'm saying. Amen. Because of the revelation of the hour that God has given us. Our worship is not a worship of routine. Our worship is not a worship. Amen. Where we're subjugated to the rudiments of a church system. Amen. And as long as we do everything right according to the church system, we'll be accepted by God. God has never wanted that. That has never been his desire. What God wants is somebody to give him back. Amen. The revelation that he puts in their heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. and to worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; And a man, this is what brother Bam says again, and a man that was so illiterate that he could not even sign his own name. We are told, the Bible said in the book of Acts of the Apostles, the third chapter, that he was both ignorant and unlearned. But it pleased God to make him the head of the church at Jerusalem and give him the keys to the kingdom. Because when that predestinated seed laying there in that old fisherman and when the light struck it quickly it recognized that that was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; That's why he gave him the keys. Amen. Praise God. This is the scripture brother's referring to in Acts 4:10. Says, "Be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, who God raised from the dead, even by him did this man stand here before you whole." This is the stone which was set it not of the builders, which has become the head of the corner. Hey, listen. I absolutely love when he starts preaching like this because before his conversion, Amen, Peter got a revelation from God and he knew who Jesus was, but he hadn't put the whole program together yet. He didn't understand how it tied in with the scriptures and he didn't understand the prophecies and he was fighting against the very word of God that Jesus had to be taken and and crucified and raised again the third day. He was actually fighting the word because he didn't have a revelation of the word yet. Amen. But something happened. Amen. At the baptism of the Holy Ghost, God unlocked an understanding inside of him. And on the road to Emmas, we know that Jesus in his resurrected ministry, he began to break down the word and he began to to un he began to open the scriptures to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when he get saw them all gathered in behind the closed doors and he stepped in amongst their mist. Amen. He began to open their understanding to understand the scriptures. So this has been working on Peter and the resurrection ministry of Jesus Christ. He begins to open the word and he begins to open understanding. And now when the fire of the Holy Ghost comes and LIGHTS IT ALL OFF, ALL OF A SUDDEN Peter runs out and he's no more scared and he's no more angry and he's no more fighting and none of what none of what he was trying to do, amen, to produce something. It all stops. And now he comes OUT AND HE SAYS THE WORD says and the word says and the word says and the word says and now he's been arrested for healing a man. He's been taken before the the Sanhedrin. They got him standing in the council. The very Jews he was running from and hiding from because he was afraid to get arrested. He was afraid to be associated with Jesus Christ. He was afraid to be grouped into the Galileans that were following that man of Nazareth. Amen. NOW, HE STANDS RIGHT UP IN the midst of them and says, "Listen, this is the stone THAT THE BUILDER," WHAT'S HE DOING? HE'S QUOTING THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES BY REVELATION. AND HE KNOWS EXACTLY where he's standing and he's giving to them where he's in the Sanhedrin with the keys TO THE KINGDOM, OPENING A DOOR FOR THEM. AMEN. And they're turning IT AND LOCKING IT BACK. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Cuz they don't want it to be true. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So I love to listen to Peter preach on the day of Pentecost and every other dialogue that he has absolutely thrills my heart. This is the same man that ran away and when a maiden asked him the third time, "Are you one of them?" He began to curse. He began to swear and say, "I know not the man." And run out and we wet bitterly. Listen, God did not give him these keys because he was the most upstanding citizen. &gt;&gt; But because he could receive divine revelation from the father, &gt;&gt; and when it lit off at the baptism of the Holy Ghost, this is the stone which was set at not of you builders, which has become the head of the corner. What's he doing? He's listen he's not just quoting a prophecy. He's placing it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; This is the stone which was said it not of you builders. &gt;&gt; You're in the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This prophecy is for today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They're so angry at him because he's interpreting the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the stone which was set it not of you builders which is become the head of the corner. &gt;&gt; Neither is there salvation in any other. For there is none other name under heaven given among men where we must be saved. Listen where is Peter saying I think I feel like &gt;&gt; according to my study &gt;&gt; I see it as this way. NO, THIS MAN IS OPERATING by divine revelation from the father. And he knows exactly the prophecy that's fulfilled for his day. &gt;&gt; Said there is neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant, this means this means uh illiterate and uneducated. They marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; They listen. &gt;&gt; They didn't give him a writing assignment. &gt;&gt; They could just tell by being around him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want you to see this word here. &gt;&gt; Perceived. They perceived &gt;&gt; that they were unlearned and ignorant men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was obvious, friends. &gt;&gt; Can we just put it that way? &gt;&gt; It was obvious he shouldn't be talking like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where did he get that understanding? &gt;&gt; You ever witness to somebody? Amen. Somebody who claims, you know, they really know the Bible really well and after you've been witnessing to for a while, they're like, "Where did you get all this?" Right? You know why? They perceived that you were unlearned. They perceived that. Listen, you're no theologian. You know, Dr. Din, you shouldn't know your Bible that well. You shouldn't be able to put all Where did you You didn't get this by study because you're not that smart. &gt;&gt; That's really what they're saying to you. And if they ever do that to you again, YOU GO, "PRAISE GOD. I GOT IT BY DIVINE revelation from the Father. God sent a man in our day that unlocked another key. Amen. Another dispensational change. And there was something in my HEART THAT WAS PRICRICKED UNDER THAT PREACHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he brought us right back to the formula and right back to water baptism in Jesus' name and right back to the dispensation of truth. &gt;&gt; They perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned. Unlearned and ignorant men and they marveled that they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus. Oh, praise God. God, give us a divine revelation of your word. And the message paradox says, "The smartest men he had was emperors and kings and potentates and monarchs, high priests and churchmen." He could have took any of those. But it was a paradox when he called a man who couldn't even sign his own name and said, "I give you the keys to the kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. What you loose on earth, I'll loose in heaven. Say, I just thought of of that about that vision. He was brother speaking of a vision that he had. What you loose or bind. What you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. What you loose on earth, I'll loose in heaven. He Yes, he give that not to a learned high priest, Caiaphasis, Caiaphas, but to an ignorant fisherman. &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. I don't want to keep putting this off on Peter &gt;&gt; or even on brother Brandham. But if he would do that for Peter, he could give me the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Listen, I at least I can read. &gt;&gt; But Paul had to come to the place where even his ability to read became his dong. &gt;&gt; That didn't do me any good. &gt;&gt; Paul got to the place where he said, "I went to the best school of Galia. I was born a Pharisee of the Pharisees. I'm of the tribe of Benjamin. I was up with the up and ups and I was all of this, that, and the other. And then he says, "Didn't do me no good. &gt;&gt; Reading and education and all that." It it failed me. &gt;&gt; I counted as all done. But when I come in contact with the pillar of fire, all of a sudden, I knew everything I knew was wrong. &gt;&gt; And Christ took me out to the backside of a desert for three years and three and a half years, and he taught me the scriptures correctly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Lord, teach me the scriptures correctly. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam, now now he's coming down to the marriage and divorce. We know in the marriage divorce is where he says, "The Lord told him to come and tell the people, I forgive you, &gt;&gt; but don't you ever do it again." &gt;&gt; And he gets some uh uh flak from a a woman, it said, he's going to talk about it here. He says, "As in the marriage and divorce case the other day, when the Holy Spirit had told me that, I come said it just the way he told me. Some minister lady give me a right sharp little balling out." She said, 'I guess you take the place of God.' I said, 'N no, ma'am. Said, 'Well, you told them their sins is forgiven.' Said, where?' He said, only God has power. See another see another Pharisee. She said, listen, she's saying you you told them their sins were forgiven. You're wrong. &gt;&gt; Well, God told him he could say that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He said it just the way God told him to say it. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this woman, she says, "Well, you told her sins were forgiven. Only God has power." And brother said, "See, another Pharisee. &gt;&gt; She doesn't even understand." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Another Pharisee. I said, "You see that you might know that Jesus told Peter and the apostles after he had the revelation of who he was, he told them, thou art Christ, the son of God." He said, "Blessed art thou, thou son of Jonas. Flesh and blood never revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven has revealed it. Upon this rock I'll build my church. The gates of hell can't prevail against it. And I give unto thee the keys. Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. What you loose on earth. That's the divine revelation of the word made flesh. What was it? It was the divine revelation of the word made flesh. If it was flesh in that day by the son, the groom, it is flesh today by the bride. Whosoever sins you remit, to them they are remitted. Whosoever sins you retain, to them they are retained. Now the Catholic Church picked that up and takes it to their priest. But that's carnal. &gt;&gt; Watch. It was the spiritual revealed word that did it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't somebody saying, "Oh, now you're forgiven." No. Brother Brenham said those that are following this message &gt;&gt; to you that that believe me and are following this message to you. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who was forgiveness given to? To those that had a revelation of the message, &gt;&gt; the revealed word for the hour. &gt;&gt; Watch. It was the spiritual revealed word that did it. That's the reason he told them to go baptize in the name of father, son, holy ghost. He knowed they knew who he was. &gt;&gt; The reason he told them, brother Ben says to baptize in the name of father and son and holy ghost is because he knew that they knew who he was. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD CAUGHT IT BY REVELATION. AND SO THEY gave the revelation. AND BROTHER BENHAM TIES THIS together to his ability to stand before a group of people that are caught in a bunch of messed up marriages because of clergy, because of religious leaders, because of church systems that had taught the word wrong, that had left the word generations ago, taught it wrong, and the people were stuck in ignorance. But at the opening of the seals, and at the opening of the word, when the word came back, these people received the word. Brother Brandham didn't say everybody in here is forgiven. Those who are following this message, those who have caught the revelation, those who believe the word and because of your faith in the word that you're hearing, God has forgiven you of that sin because that sin was done in ignorance because of wrong teaching by clergymen and pastors and preachers. BUT NOW AT THE OPENING of the word, HE SAYS, I HE SAID, GOD TOLD ME TO TELL YOU, I forgive you. &gt;&gt; What was it? It was the spiritual revealed word that did it. &gt;&gt; Then he talks ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH picked that up and now you go into a confessional booth with a priest and you tell the priest everything you did wrong and he tells you some little thing you have to do. Hail Marys or whatever some penance you do that and then you'll be forgiven and he forgives you. He's taking the scripture carnally upon a human being and saying that he has the power to forgive. And then that was never placed in human flesh and a human being with a HUMAN MIND. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN BY THE REVEALED WORD. And if a man will preach the word of God, amen, the true word for the hour that we live in, that word has a power to cleanse you from all sin. HAS A POWER TO SET YOU free from the bondage that you're in. IT HAS A POWER TO FORGIVE YOU OF ALL SINS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BENHAM'S TELLING US HERE. IT'S THE SPIRITUAL REVEALED WORD THAT DID IT. IT wasn't just A MAN SAYING, "I FORGIVE YOU." HE SAID, "I FOR ALL THOSE THAT ARE FOLLOWING THIS MESSAGE, everyone that believes this TO BE TRUE." GOD TOLD ME I COULD TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE WHEN THE WORD OPENED, SOMETHING INSIDE OF THEM WAS PRICRICKED AND THEY SAID, "THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH." THEY FIND THEMSELVES CONDEMNED. THEY FIND THEMSELVES in a bad situation. BUT THERE WAS something else in them THAT COULD RECOGNIZE WHAT THAT MAN JUST PREACHED IS NOTHING BUT the truth. &gt;&gt; And God could forgive them. &gt;&gt; The key was open and they went through the door. But those who rejected the message, he said it was for those who are following the message &gt;&gt; to my church, to my people, those who are following this message. In John 6, he says, "Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the son of the living God. This is why God could trust him with the keys even later. Amen. When everybody walked away. Oh, this is why Peter could be trusted. When the when the crowds departed because they were confused about the message that was being preached when the ministerial association left him. When when the 70 close associates that went out two by two, Amen. preparing the way for him to come preach and doing miracles and all of these things when they got confused about the word he was preaching and they walked away. Then he turns to the disciples &gt;&gt; and he says, "Will you go also?" &gt;&gt; This is when Peter says this &gt;&gt; when it gets down to the wire. Amen. When it gets down to it, Amen. Peter doesn't know about drinking blood. Peter doesn't know about eating flesh. Peter doesn't understand why everybody's walking away. Peter's is confused. Peter doesn't understand what Jesus was saying anymore than the people who walked away. &gt;&gt; But something inside of him come alive. Amen. Through the dispensation he was in. And he knew, I don't know what you're saying. I don't know why they're leaving. I don't know what's happening. I don't fully comprehend what's going on right now. But I I know I know thou has the words of eternal life. And we BELIEVE AND ARE SURE. HOW WAS HE SURE? HE WASN'T SURE INTELLECTUALLY. HE WAS SURE IN HIS SOUL. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE FATHER GAVE HIM A REVELATION. That's the only way you can be sure. &gt;&gt; And we believe and are sure that thou art, the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; This is why God gave him the keys. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 17 says, "And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all." Likewise also, as it was in the days of Lot, they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded. But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. &gt;&gt; Anybody have any idea what this prophecy is about? What period of time? &gt;&gt; Today, &gt;&gt; this day, this scripture is being fulfilled. Right. &gt;&gt; These are the days of Noah as it was in the days of Noah. As it was in the days of Sodom, that's this day. How many times did Brother Benham used this scripture to point us to his ministry? &gt;&gt; It's in those days is when the son of man is being revealed. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ was being revealed 2,000 years ago. Amen. In a body of flesh as Jesus of Nazareth. Amen. And there was some there that were catching the revelation. And that revelation was changing their lives. And they were recognizing, "Thou you, this man, this flesh, this body, YOU THAT'S STANDING HERE WALKING, TALKING to me, eating bread across the table from me in a boat, YOU ARE CHRIST, THE son of the living God." &gt;&gt; That was a tremendous revelation. But here's a prophecy of another day, an end time sign, an end time. Amen. Where it's going to be the days of Noah again. It's going to be as it was. And in the days of Noah, man's heart was continually on evil. And he did all that was in the imaginations of his heart. Amen. And and men were were taking wives as they choose. There was marriage and divorce on the rampage. Amen. The violence had filled the earth. Amen. In Sodom. Amen. They were in a sodomite condition where there was immorality because of lust and homosexuality and and all kinds of perversion sexually. Amen. And brother Brandham showed us that to show we're in that age. &gt;&gt; But in this day, the son of man is going to be revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's going to see it? &gt;&gt; He was being revealed in his first coming. He's being revealed in this coming. &gt;&gt; But who can see it? Only babes. &gt;&gt; Only those who can get a revelation from the father. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to 1 Corinthians 2 together. 1 Corinthians chapter 2:6. How be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect. Yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to not. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which none of the princes of this world knew. For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, I had not seen nor ear heard, neither entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But, oh, I love this. But, it's never entered into the heart of man. Man has never seen. Man has never heard. It's never entered into his heart the things that the Lord's prepared. But, &gt;&gt; but, &gt;&gt; but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. &gt;&gt; We're not still stuck behind the veil of ignorance. We're not still stuck behind of darkness. There's been an unveiling. But God has revealed them to us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God, which things we also which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things, with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God. For they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. Yes. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul's telling in all my preaching and all that are teaching, we're comparing spiritual things with spiritual because that's what the Holy Ghost does. Compares spiritual things with spiritual so that the spiritual man by the divine interpretation of the spirit can catch the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; But a natural man can't catch it. &gt;&gt; The natural the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God. These things are spiritually given and only the spirit of God can quicken them to our understanding, can give us the revelation of them. The natural man can't get it. I say, "Thank you, God, for making me a babe &gt;&gt; and God give me more of your spirit &gt;&gt; and let the spirit be my teacher &gt;&gt; because my natural man is not going to catch these things." And this out of the church age book here in the Smyrnan church age the prophet says he quotes Revelation 2:1. He that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. There is not one church age where this verse is not mentioned. Every single age has the same admonition to the people of every age. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith. But it is absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the different ages. If you've heard what the spirit says in your age, praise God. &gt;&gt; Because it is absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says. Somebody can play a tape, but it doesn't mean they heard what the spirit says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, putting these verses together, he just went through several verses. We see that there's only one group of people and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age. It is one special group that receives the revelation for each age. That group is of God because the group that cannot hear is not of God. The group that can and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives the revelation thereof is that group described in 1 Corinthians 2:6-16. That's what we just read. They are the ones who have the spirit of God. They are the ones that are born of God. They are baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ by his spirit. They are baptized with the Holy Ghost. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To further bring out what we have just said and to also use the scripture that should be born in mind as we talk about who it is that is baptized with the Holy Ghost. See what Jesus says in John 6:45. It is written in the prophets, and they shall all be taught of God. But turn to Isaiah 54:13. Whence this is taken and and it reads and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord. The all of God are the children of God. Thus it is that the evidence of being a true child of God. He whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou has hid this from the wise and prudent and has revealed it to babes. Who are the all that are taught of God? His children. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad I'm one of his children. Modern events, he says the Bible is to be revealed by inspiration. That's the only thing that the revelation Jesus told Peter upon this rock, this rock of revelation reveals who he is. Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonas. Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you. Upon this rock, I'll build my church. not upon Peter, not upon himself, but upon the spiritual revelation of who he was. &gt;&gt; And he is the word. &gt;&gt; St. John 1, in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Hebrews 13:8, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. How is he the same yesterday, today, today, forever? Because he is the word made manifest in every age. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's always been the word made manifest. He's always been Christ the anointed word. And he's Christ the anointed word in this age in the day when the son of man is being revealed. And the revealing of the son of man is attached to the coming of the son of man. And when we see and hear that prophet preaching and breaking down the word and doing what Peter did and taking all the scriptures and saying this day is the scripture fulfilled and this day is the scripture fulfilled and this day, amen, it has the same effect on us as it did on them. They were pricricked in their heart and they received Jesus Christ. Amen. AND HE SAID, "WHAT SHALL we do?" AND HERE WE ARE THAT DAY THAT THAT PETER WAS THERE and he caught a revelation from the father. He says, "Who am I? Who does everybody say? What do THEY SAY ABOUT THIS MESSAGE?" WELL, you know, Brother Brandon was a good man and he got off on the end and he had some good moral teaching that makes a good family. But who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; Who do you say that I am? AMEN. IS NOT just good teaching. It's just not a better way to live. AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR A CHURCH AND GOOD FOR RAISING kids and all of THOSE OTHER THINGS. THIS is none other than Jesus Christ, the son of man, revealing himself to his bride. And when I look at that, I SAY, "THOU ART CHRIST. THOU ART MY HUSBAND THAT ARE JESUS CHRIST." AMEN. REVEALING YOURSELF to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, today and this hour &gt;&gt; and things that are to be, he says, you see, the whole program, the whole church is built upon divine revelation. Jesus said in St. Matthew the 16th chapter, flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you. What was it? A revelation of who he was. What was it? What was the revelation? He caught the revelation of who this really is. &gt;&gt; You're not just a man. &gt;&gt; You're more than a man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're the anointed. You're You're the fulfillment of Genesis 3. &gt;&gt; You're the fulfillment of Isaiah 7. You're &gt;&gt; the anointed. You're the Messiah. You're Christ, the son of the living God. By revelation, he recognized who this is. Flesh and blood didn't to him, but my father, what was it? Amen. It was the revelation of who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read this again. Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven is revealed to you. What was it? The revelation of who he was. And upon this rock I'll build my church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against it. See, the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour, &gt;&gt; right? Not what he was in another hour. What he was what he was now. The Bible expresses it's growing in the bride to the full stature. &gt;&gt; What has he come to reveal to me today? What is the opening of the key today? What is it that brings me into this formula today? Amen. It's Jesus Christ revealed today. &gt;&gt; Not what he was in another hour, but what he is now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me to Luke chapter 7. Luke 7 and verse 44 says, "And he turned to the woman and he said,"Simon, seeest thou this woman I entered into thine house. Thou gavest me no water for my feet, but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss, but this woman since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil, thou did not anoint, but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven. for she loved much, but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And he said unto her, "Thy sins are forgiven." And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, who is this that forgiveth sins also? See that statement we just read? That's why brother Brenham said, "See another Pharisee." Because that was a Pharisees at the Pharisees at the table. And Simon was a Pharisees house. And when Jesus says, "Your sins are forgiven," the Pharisee says, "Who is this man that forgiveth sins?" &gt;&gt; Who is this? How dare you? That's the same thing that woman preacher did to brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; But brother Bam said, "You don't get it." &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a confessional booth. &gt;&gt; It wasn't me just declaring, "I want to forgive you." No, it was them receiving the spiritual revealed word. &gt;&gt; It was the spiritual revealed word that did it. &gt;&gt; And listen, who is this that forgiveth sins also? And he said to the woman, "Thy faith hath saved thee. Go in peace." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What saved her? What forgave her sins? What made her whole? &gt;&gt; Well, he says, "Well, she she washed my feet. You didn't wash them. She didn't. And you didn't kiss me. She did. And you never anointed me with oil." But she did. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know, when it comes down to it, Jesus doesn't say, "Because of your service to me, &gt;&gt; you're saved." &gt;&gt; She did all of that because she believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Simon didn't do all of that cuz he didn't believe. &gt;&gt; To one, a door was locked. To another, a door was open. &gt;&gt; It says her sins, which were many, &gt;&gt; were all forgiven. She didn't ask forgiveness. No doubt it was in her heart. No doubt she was repentant. No doubt she was sorry. She didn't have to go to the temple. She didn't have to offer a turtle dove. She didn't have to give a lamb. What was it that saved her? &gt;&gt; Her faith. &gt;&gt; But her faith in what? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What was she believing in? the present tense word made manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the spiritually revealed word that did it. When she accepted Christ for who he was and she ran to him and gave all. Amen. Jesus looked down at her. Listen, it wasn't a works program. It wasn't the amount of effort she put in. It wasn't the work that she did. But Jesus recognized he who who is forgiven much love as much. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What was she loving? It wasn't just a general love to everybody. She was loving the word. &gt;&gt; She was loving the word in person right in front of her. She was loving Jesus Christ, the son of God. And she ran and she did him a service that that Simon didn't want to do. And he looked at her and says, "Now listen, before she spoke anything to him, Amen. before he acknowledged anything, he says, "Your sins are forgiven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your sins are This is why brother Brandham could forgive at marriage and divorce on the same basis. &gt;&gt; Your sins are all which are many are all forgiven. Can you imagine how this woman felt? She knew her reputation. She knew what she was. She was trying to get out of it. She didn't like her lifestyle. She was ashamed and embarrassed and all the things that she had to go through. She didn't want any of it. Amen. But what she did was recognize that this is the Messiah in our midst. Jesus is Christ and nobody's serving him and nobody will. I will. And she runs and she throws herself at her feet and she pours herself out to him and he says, "You're forgiven." Amen. What did it? She received the word for her day and that word cleansed her from all unrighteousness and forgave her of her sins. And he says, "Your faith &gt;&gt; has saved you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith in what? She wasn't in the temple. She wasn't bringing a lamb. What did she believe? She believed the present tense word, &gt;&gt; Messiah standing before her. &gt;&gt; There's a couple statements brother Brandon makes I just want to read now in light of this. Says, "And the Holy Spirit bears record of the predestinated gift that a church claims she has." What? By watering the word, punctuating in the word with an amen. When it said repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. When it says these other things, amen. That's it. Amen to everything. See, it punctuates the word and God by predestinated the gift to come to remit sins. But it was given to the spiritfilled word body because the word can only forgive sins because the word is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When that Pharisee says, "How can this being a man forgive sins?" They didn't realize it was the word that was forgiving sins. She was accepting the word and its fullness in her day and her acceptance of that word. She was FORGIVEN BASED ON THE WORD. It was her attitude towards the word because the word is God. How true the Pharisees was. I mentioned this morning. We'd get to this and I've took my time, but the Pharisees said, "This man forgives sins." We know he's a blasphemer. Only God can forgive sins. And this man is forgiving sins. Not knowing that he was the word. The word forgives sins because it's God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it. Friends, look. Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the revelation. &gt;&gt; Christ life in you makes him the center of the revelation. Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. See what God is trying to do. He's trying to get us to re he trying to reveal himself to us and reveal himself in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's trying to reveal himself in us to us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What is the new birth then? You said, "Well, brother Brandham, what is the new birth?" It's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. Amen. See, not you joined a church, you shook a hand, you done something different, you said a creed, you promised to live by a code of rules, but Christ, the Bible, he is the word that was revealed to you. And no matter what anybody says, what takes place, it's Christ, the pastor, priest, whatever it might be, it's Christ in you. That's the revelation that the church is built upon. &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of the word for today. And that revelation of the word is coming into me. It's Christ in me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he is the word. Back in the church age book, Brother Ben says, "Now we need revelation by the spirit. We don't need a new Bible. We don't need a new translation. though some are very good and I'm not against them. But we need the revelation of the spirit and thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit. May God begin by his spirit to give us continuous lifegiving. Is it lifegiving &gt;&gt; and prevailing revelation? Oh, if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the living word manifested, we would do the greater works and glorify God our father in heaven. How many wants a fresh revelation? I want a fresh revelation. I want more revelation. I want God to make this word for this hour crystal clear to me. And then I can see God in all of his glory. And I can see where he's working and when he's working and who he's working in. And I can find him wanting to work in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, give us continuous lifegiving and prevailing revelation &gt;&gt; because that's the foundation and the enemy cannot cannot that gave to me cannot prevail over that revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother M says your first wedding was anulled. it was you never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it and that would be God come down himself and took your place in the form of son of God Jesus Christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how are you going to be washed you're still as spotted as Eve was &gt;&gt; brother said it's the word that forgives because God is the word and Now, it's the word that's washing us from all of our sins. It's washing away all corruption and all pollution. Amen. This word has a washing power. This word has a it's a living word. And the living word, the purified living word is washing us clean. &gt;&gt; And we're standing under a fountain of purified word because we've got a PROPHET IN OUR DAY TO RESTORE to us the truths that were lost through the church ages. And we have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication. Meaning it's not injected with man's ideas. If we get it from the prophet, we get it from the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A PURIFIED WATER. AMEN. AND I ASK YOU THIS QUESTION, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET CLEAN and dirty water? HOW CAN WE GO BACK TO THE DENOMINATIONS AND BACK to denominational ideas that's corrupted and polluted by the MINDS OF MAN? GOD GAVE US A PURIFYING WATER BY his own spirit AND BLOOD IN THIS HOUR TO WASH HIS BRIDE PERFECTLY CLEAN. AND YOU CAN'T get clean AND DIRTY WATER. YOU MUST COME TO this message to BE PURIFIED AND BROUGHT BACK TO A virgin condition. &gt;&gt; Has to be this message. BUT THIS MESSAGE HAS THE POWER TO DO IT. FRIENDS, YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER. IT'S THIS MESSAGE HAS THE POWER. IT'S THIS WORD THAT'S BEEN RESTORED. HAS THE POWER TO WASH US FROM ALL THE PROSTITUTE SPIRITS and bring us &gt;&gt; into a virgin condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be united with Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the power of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. How will we get clean and dirty water? How will you grow into the stature of a perfect man &gt;&gt; with corrupt grain &gt;&gt; with bad food? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It takes the food that was stored up. &gt;&gt; It takes the bread from heaven. It takes the mana himself to nourish us and grow us into the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; And it takes the pure water of the word to wash us clean. Amen. &gt;&gt; And both have been given to us in this day. &gt;&gt; But God has to reveal it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord tells us in Ephesians, "Husband, love your wife." He said, "Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it." That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word. that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. &gt;&gt; You know what? He didn't say that we were going to be spot-ree and wrinkle-free and without blemish when we finally got our act together, &gt;&gt; started a better works program. No, but he said he would wash us by the water of the word and he would bring us into this condition by purifying us by his word. &gt;&gt; The invisible union of the bride. It says, "What is sin?" Sin is unbelief. Unbelief in what? The word. Unbelief in God, which is the word. Pure, unadulterated. Oh, hallelujah. Leaving soon for the skies. Amen. Standing ready. thing. Your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word. The word became blood. The word bled for you. And you were washed in the bleeding word. Don't forget it was the word that was nailed to Calvary. &gt;&gt; It was the word that died for me. It was the word that bled for me. &gt;&gt; And now we're washed in the bleeding word. The word bleeding, the life of God in the word. And the word was bled for you. that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on his word. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the hour we live in. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the open door, friends. I thank God that he sent a prophet and he restored his word and there's a clean water to get washed in. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a pure water that'll wash us by faith, by believing the word. Amen. by receiving Christ for our day. Amen. That will wash us from all of our sins and purify us and bring us into a union with him. So glad he's given us a word that'll bring us to the stature of the fullness of Christ because he's restored all the word in perfection. No more corrupt hybrid grain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We talked a couple a few serum quality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought us back to the original. And listen friends, this is the power to loose and bind. &gt;&gt; It's still available. It's still based on the word. It's still based on faith in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's still based on faith in the in the word for your day. It's still loosing us from our sins. It's still freeing us from our misunderstanding. It's still delivering us. &gt;&gt; And it's bringing us to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, God's called us to be kings and priests. &gt;&gt; Kings and priests over a spiritual kingdom. Kings and priests. Amen. And and and we're over a spiritual kingdom, but we're walking in this earth as priests. Now, what are priests? Priests are intercessors. They intercede for the people. Amen. They stand in the gap and they intercede for the people. But a priest in order to offer his office, he's got to have blood of some kind to offer. Amen. And there's got to be an offering of blood. But we're priests, but we're priests after the order of Melzdc. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't have an order without blood. For he shed his blood and his blood is his life and he sent back his life and we're carrying his life around, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THE BLOOD. WE'VE GOT THE LIFE. WE'VE GOT THE WORD. WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT WHAT GOD SENT for this age. Amen. And what we can offer to people is not an idea. It's not a program. It's not a religious ceremony. It's not a church system. It's none of that. We're going to DELIVER TO THEM CHRIST JESUS THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And they can receive the word. &gt;&gt; They can be washed. They can be sanctified. They can be purified. They can be united with the word. &gt;&gt; I say, God, thank you &gt;&gt; for an open door. &gt;&gt; Thank you for a message. Thank you for something to give somebody, &gt;&gt; something to share. I want to be like Peter, not running and hiding, but I want to stand there. This is the day. This is the prophecy. This is what he promised. This is the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If somebody could find their way to the feet of Christ in this hour, pour their heart out to him and receive the word for their day and find Christ Jesus alive today. &gt;&gt; They can weep at his feet and pour their life out to him. He can forgive them of all their sins. &gt;&gt; Daniel seen a prophecy of the end time. And the Bible says in Daniel 12:9, he says, "And he said, 'Go thy way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end, many shall be purified and made white and tried, but the wicked shall do wickedly, and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand." &gt;&gt; How is the wise going to understand? &gt;&gt; Because we got smarter. &gt;&gt; No, because we're the babes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That he saw fit to reveal it to. &gt;&gt; I say, "Thank you, Lord, for this message." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for a clean water to stand underneath. Thank you for a pure word. Thank you for something to eat. Thank you for your life. Thank you for the truth. Thank you for everything you've given us in this day. And God, I don't want to just be thankful to myself, but I also want to recognize that there's still a gospel being preached. There's still an open door. And oh, I'd love for somebody else to find their way to the fountain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'd love for God to strike somebody else with revelation. And they could say, "This is nothing but the truth. This is Christ." &gt;&gt; Oh, God, keep the door open. &gt;&gt; Amen. There still can be a loosing. There can still be a binding. There still can be a rejection of truth and be a bind. But but I don't want to focus on that part. I want to focus on the loosing part. Someone can still be loosed and set free. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the message that can loose us and set us free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together. Amen. That's what I had on my heart to share. We're walking around. You know what brother Brandham said? I I don't have the quote overhead, but I've got it here. I wasn't going to put it in my notes, but I just left it on my paper. Brother Banner said, "In Christ is the mystery of God revealed." He said, "The church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood." That's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes into his body that recognizes only his body, his flesh, his word. &gt;&gt; His life is still in his bride. His life is still here. His word is still being made manifest. And I'm so thankful that God saw fit to let us be a carrier of the word. &gt;&gt; Not because I was well educated and a theologian, I was maybe as bad off as Peter, but God didn't base it off those qualifications. God never was looking for that when he looked for me. He was looking for somebody who could receive the revelation of the word. He was looking for somebody who would hear the prophet preach and hear the message and get pricked in their heart and says, "That's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. To whom else shall we go? Thou alone have the words of eternal life." &gt;&gt; I don't know where else TO GO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO TURN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO. THOU ALONE HAS THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. And I believe this message is Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad, Amen, that Peter was given something he could share. He had a revelation of the word. And when he stood on the day of Pentecost, he had something to give. And that something he gave became a key, a revealing of a mystery that could open a door. And friends, we're here today. We're not left with nothing. We still have the revelation of the word that CAN BE AN OPEN DOOR to somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, God, give us wisdom to handle the word. Give us boldness to handle the word. Give us a life that will attract people. Amen. But let there still be a loosing that's taking place in this generation as someone comes to the truth. &gt;&gt; So glad, Amen. Amen. That there's still a life, there's still a power, there's still a blood, and it's still available. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray. Dear heavenly father, we thank you, Lord, for your word. God, it's more than we can even grasp sometimes. It's more of a reality than we even sometimes are aware in our human minds. It's our soul that's stirred. It's our heart that's on fire. But God, what you have provided in this day is so amazing to us, Lord. And the fact that you've given us a heart to believe that you in this day by your word, you've purified and you've made white and you've tried. Oh, but God, may your people come forth, tried by fire, but come forth as gold. God, you've provided the faith to believe. You provided the predestinated seed to believe with. And we're so grateful, Lord. We're eternally grateful for your grace and for your election. But God, if there's still life available, if there's still a word to preach and there's still voice in our lungs to preach it, God, may we preach like Paul and Peter and all the disciples and all the saints of old. May we preach this revelation of the end time message. And God, may it be an open door for somebody. May it be a path to you, Lord. May it be a way for them to be washed and clean and edified and brought into your very presence. And may your presence be brought into them. While we love you, we thank you so much for the day and hour we live in and for eyes to see and ears to hear. For only those, Lord, that you have ordained can see and can hear. And God, we find ourselves so grateful to you. God, I thank you that you weren't looking at my ability and you're not looking at my ability now, but you're looking at one thing. There's a seed that can receive my word. And God, that's by your grace. God, we love you. We ask, God, that you would use us to give this message out to all who would hear. May you direct us, Lord, each one of us in our own way, in our own life. Direct us, Lord, as lights in this world of darkness, as priests and kings, Lord, for you. May you direct us, Lord, to those that could hear the word. May you give us the right word in the right season, and the boldness that Peter had to proclaim the truth. When the time is right, when the season is right, when the conditions are right, may you move upon us. And God, may we see your children come to the light, your babes come to the revelation and be set free, to be loosed, to be open, have the door open to them. We love you. We thank you, God, for this revelation that we hold in our hearts. For we never went and grabbed it and got it and took it and bought it. We just received it. It was given to us by your grace. And God, it means so much to us. God, if I would have been there that day, that little harlot woman was running in and throwing herself at your feet to weep, wash your feet with her tears, and to wipe, Lord, all the scum off with her hair, to bear your reproach upon herself, to give all of her living, Lord, to pour out your feet. God, if I could been so lucky to be right beside of her, I would do it, Lord. It would be a privilege for me. But I didn't live in her day, Lord. I live in this day. And you've presented yourself, Lord, not in the same fashion as you did to her, but you prevented you presented yourself in this message to us. And may it have the same effect to me, Lord. May I weep at your feet, Lord. May I May may I bear your reproach upon myself. May I gladly serve you. May I gladly give you my best. May I give it all to you and weep of repentance and joy and gratitude just to be in your presence. Oh, and I I thank you for the opportunity you've given me now. I thank you for the chance I have today. I thank you for the voice I can proclaim your word. I thank you for the for the chance that I could stand for this message and stand for this word and give my all to it. I'm so thankful because he who's forgiven much loveth much. and I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God, help all of us, Lord, to take advantage of our day, of our opportunity, of our visitation. &gt;&gt; And may we, Lord, pour ourselves out to you and love you and embrace you and kiss you and anoint you and serve you. &gt;&gt; This is our chance. I love you, Father. I thank you for your forgiveness. I thank you for your washing of your word. I thank you for the purification that comes from your word that you've provided for us. Help us to stay under this word, Lord, and be washed completely clean. We love you. We ask that you would bless us as we go from here and anoint us for the work you've called us to in this last day. We ask for your blessings in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And brother John, &gt;&gt; give me more revelation. Let my flesh be all forsen. at the word of God. Guide me on my way so he can have preeminence each day. Give me more revelation. Oh, let my life be your reflection. For I know this word is my redemption. Give me more revelation. Give me more revelation. Let my flesh be all forsen. That the word of God guide me on my way so he can have preeminence each day. Give me more revelation. Let my life be your reflection. For I know this word is my redemption. Give me more revelation. Oh, give me more revelation and let my flesh be all forsen. and the word of God guide me on my way so he can have preeminence each day. Give me more revelation. Let my life be your reflection. For I know this word is my redemption. Give me more revelation. Come away. Thank you. Amen. There's a table dressed in linen. A banquet is prepared. Host of angels gathered for a celebration there. And the bride is almost ready in spotless wide array. A hush falls over heaven. My room begins to sing. Come away my love. Oh come away my love. I have waited for this day when I could give to you my name. Oh, eternity awaits us. Come away my love. I have loved you from creation long before you came to me. And I carried that love with me all the way to Calary. Though it wasn't over when they laid me in the tomb, I proved my love would never die. A rose again for you. Oh, come away. My love, come away.

How can he desire to have fellowship with me? must be something more within that only he can see. And I pray, dear Lord, please take my life, give it all to thee. Oh, grant that every day that you'll commune with me. And on the road to Emma us, three men walked that day. And as they reach their destination, but to beg the third to stay. And as they talk together, breaking bread and pouring wine. Oh, I finally now realize the simplicity of this time. Oh, how can he desire to have fellowship with me?

And he opened our understanding in simplicity Christ. And now I know that he desires to have fellowship with me. He reveals something more within. Until now I did not see.

I've seen a vision harsh and sweet of one who gave all he had for me. I've seen the passion of his death and the forgiveness in his final breath. And now I can never be the same. My life has been forever changed. I've got to live and love and give because he gave. And now I'm giving my life away. I'm laying it down on the altar now. I'm giving my life away. Oh, the very least I can offer is my all. So here I stand today. I'm giving my life away. No earthly price could be too great. And no sacrifice is too much to make.
