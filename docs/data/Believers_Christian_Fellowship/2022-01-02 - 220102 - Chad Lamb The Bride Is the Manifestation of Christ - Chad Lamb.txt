you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you amen god bless you brother amen let's all stand thank you musicians amen that's the way to start the year off right amen we could use some more of that let's turn in our bibles to second corinthians chapter four i want to say that i very much enjoyed friday night it was really a wonderful time in the lord and wonderful time to be together and hear the testimonies and hear the song specials and i just thank god i thank god for what he's done amen i thank god for the fellowship here and for you brothers and sisters and i said god may god help us grow closer and closer together as time continues on also thank you brother ron for the song this morning i can't hear that song without thinking of brother nestor amen i was just speaking with him i believe it was yesterday by whatsapp and i pray that god will just open the borders and make everything easy so he can come back and visit us how many would like to see brother nestor smile here at this pulpit again next year this coming year because when brother nestor smiles he's all smiling amen it warms my heart so we we hope that he can come i mean also i heard that sister deb johns is here sister john's back in the service amen god bless you sister deb it's good to see you again she's been really sick her and her husband with coven but god is faithful to his word amen it's good to see you in the service again amen let's look at this scripture here second corinthians chapter 4 verse 3. but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them amen god bless you as you have your seats may the lord bless his word as we look into it tonight from out of this scripture i just want to focus mainly on the part that said the the gospel of christ who is the image of god so we know that christ is the image of god jesus christ was manifest on earth to reflect god to be the image of god and made flesh and we want to talk about that a little bit this this morning and as i've been preparing the service the lord's been dealing with me in a very specific direction and i i have a disclaimer before we start the service that there's nothing new amen there's we've been through all these quotes we've been through all these scriptures we've been talking and discussing these things for years but god just all of a sudden you know how it is there's a little greater clarity that comes all the time and things begin to just focus more and more and the picture you've been looking at all of a sudden comes into focus a little clearer and that's the way it is has been for me and there's a certain phrase that this title but i'm not going to give you the title now i'll give it to you in a minute and this title begins to focus my um uh my vision my revelation down a little bit and this came from a conversation i was having from brother jean he made a statement to me and it was about five or six weeks ago and i haven't been able to shake that statement and it just keeps working on me and working on me and it's the revelation of everything that we've been talking about and we'll get to that in a moment but tonight or not tonight this morning i'm going to read quite a few quotes because i want i want to read what the prophet said about these things so i'm going to read quite a few quotes but don't tune out or shut down on me say amen to the quote amen because the quote is preaching brother ben was preaching it we'll quote it like we're preaching it amen and you say amen just like it's being freshly preached because i am going to do quite a bit of reading so let's stay engaged through the reading because there's some magnificent things that the prophet says some wonderful things that this message has come to illuminate for us so that we understand where we are in the word where we are in the plan of god who we are in the plan of god and what is being manifest in this hour god has so worked his plan he does not want us confused about who we are where we are in time and what the manifestation of this hour is you know because if we don't listen to what the prophet has told us especially after the opening of the seals amen we'll be looking back or looking forward we'll be waiting for something amen and god does not want this bride waiting this is not the age of waiting this is the age of manifesting there is a word that has been laying in the thought of god and been hidden as a mystery through this bible amen for thousands and thousands of years it's been laying in the word and for more than years before years into eternity it was in the back part of god's mind and that thought which has become word is to be a manifested word today and so we have to catch that thought that word that is now to be made flesh and manifest in the day that we're living today because that is what god has ordained and called for in this day and if we're the people of the day of the manifestation of the day then we have to stop looking somewhere else for the word to be manifest or waiting somewhere or seeing it here seeing it there but we must come to the realization that the plan of god the word of god everything that god has done has come to this moment and we're a privileged people to be on this planet in this dimension at this moment and we don't want to miss that so as i'm reading amen just stay with me don't tune out stay engaged and i think we'll enjoy the word together i still have a little bit of a cough but i'm rebuking the devil every minute of the day i'm resisting the devil and he must flee so if i cough i hope it doesn't bother you but it surely does not bother me i've coughed so much in my life i'm used to it amen and the message works as faith expressed the prophet of god says the baptist minister told me not long ago i just can't accept revelation i said then you cannot accept the bible you cannot accept christ because he is the revelation of god he's god revealed in flesh therefore the whole church is built upon the divine revelation in the first seal the prophet says christ is the revelation of god so we want to lock that down christ is the revelation of god he came to reveal god because he and god were the same god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and otherwise you never know just what god was until he revealed himself through christ then you can see i want you to lock that statement down and i'm going to read it again but i want you to remember this statement out of the first seal and otherwise you never know just what god was until he revealed himself through christ then you can see so christ came to reveal god he came to manifest god he was god in flesh he was the revelation the manifestation of the invisible god now manifest in a body of flesh and a man named jesus christ and so and you never know just what god was until you revealed himself through christ then you can see i don't want you to forget that christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now for a text i want to take out of there for a text basing it upon the entire bible but i want to use this i want us to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god revealed so that's what brother branham's theme is when he begins to preach christ is the mystery god revealed he's telling you he's basing it on the entire bible but it's christ the mystery of god revealed there's been a mystery to god a mystery in his mind a mystery of how god will manifest himself reveal himself come tangible come flesh there's been a mystery to god but christ is the revelation of that mystery of god christ is the mystery of god revealed so if you want to see the mystery of god amen you you look to christ because christ is manifesting the mystery of god let's turn to the book of colossians together and read from chapter one colossians chapter one colossians 1 and i'll begin with 12. we're going to read down to 18 giving thanks unto the father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who hath delivered us from the who has delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so we see that verse 15 tells us that christ is the image of the invisible god and brother ben's going to reference this here in christ is the mystery of god revealed we're going down just a little further in christ as the mystery god revealed he says the first thing was that god wanted to reveal himself to the people you know no matter how much we desire that christ would come to save us from our sins god had a desire and coming as a son amen because he had a desire to reveal himself to the people so we when you think about what god has done in the plan of god and the plan of salvation and redemption and the manifestation of god and all the things we think about in this day you have to we we need to go back into the mind of god that's been revealed to us in this end time back before there was star molecule stardust before there was anything god was alone with his thoughts and god in his thoughts had a plan and that plan included you and i and and we know that we were our names were written in the lamb's book of life of the book of life of the lamb before the foundation of the world so that means you and i were included in the in the thought of god the plan of god that was sealed in the heavenlies before there was a foundation of the earth so so if i could say it this way no matter how much we want to love god we want to be redeemed we want to be saved god had to first want it before you would ever want it amen so which desire is greater your desire his desire his was the original desire so he had a desire unto you before you ever had a desire unto him amen and it shows we would never have a desire unto him if he didn't first have a desire unto us amen so all we're doing in this life is reflecting back a desire that god first had amen and his desire is the overriding desire that's moving everything into place so it's not it's not you know how much we love god it's how much god loves us this is grace that god loved us before before what before anything god loved us and chose us so all we're doing is just reflecting his choice his will and so from our perspective it feels like we're seeking after god and we're desiring god and we want so much to be saved and we want to be purified we want to be redeemed and we want to be one with him amen and that's such a strong desire to us but we have to realize that that desire originated in god first and that desire to for him towards us is is original to our desire towards him and if that's the truth how can we fail amen if that's the truth how could we not manifest what he desired before the foundation of the world when we realize that our greatest desire our longing all our loving all our need for him amen everything we desire is only reflecting back a desire he first had amen then you get so comfortable saying if i love him this much and want him this much amen he had to want me more and he had to want me first praise be to god this message listen i don't know how it's been preached in the past to people and what your experience has been but this message was not to bring condemnation this message was not to bring fear this message was never to put you on the fence but this message was always to take away fear anxiety doubt lies of the devil it was to take away denominational misunderstanding and it was to plant your feet on a solid ground that would be unmovable and unshakeable that you would have a confidence unfailing confidence and a god who had a plan before you ever showed up on this earth and this message maybe to you had been preached in a way that was condemning maybe to you it was preached in a way that caused fear like you wouldn't make the rapture if you weren't good enough or oh my goodness we were never good enough to make the rapture we'll never be good enough to make the rapture we already made the rapture that's the only way you'll make the rapture if you already made the rapture the only way you can be a son or daughter of god if you've always been a son and daughter of god this message came to take the fear away amen to take the control of man away it came to free a people to be what god has always ordained for us to be so all these truths in the message and the things that god has showed us out of his word and then it came to lift the bride up so that she could be what she's called to be in this day without this message we could never be what god has called for us to be in this day we had to have something that would take us above denominational thinking above the realms of humanity above this dimension and take us back to the mind of god so that we could peer into the thoughts of god from before the foundation of the world the part of his thinking that had been sealed and this day is unsealed and it came to establish us and build our faith how can you have rapturing faith without this message without the thunder sounding how would you ever have grace for a rapture how would you ever believe in a body change if you're still doubting who you are if you don't even know if you're saved how are you going to have faith for a change in the body but this message had to come to establish us and all those things to keep lifting us and lifting us and lifting to higher realms of faith all the time christ is the mystery of god revealed i told myself i'm not going to preach a bunch i'm just going to read quotes but i might do a little bit of both we'll see where we get amen god wanted to reveal himself to the people oh if that doesn't warm your heart nothing will god wants to reveal himself to you god wants you to see him he wants you to know him he wants you to fellowship with him he couldn't do it he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god who covered all space and time and eternity he could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of life space and on out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man i love this statement friends i love this statement because because once you realize a truth that the prophet is bringing us a true understanding of the nature of god you begin to understand so many more things amen he loved fatherhood because he was in himself a father so because he was a father he needed to express himself as a father but how could he express himself as a father unless he had a son amen in order to be the right kind of son to express the right kind of fatherhood amen he had to become a son of man and when he became a son of man he in that relationship could reflect back what a father was he was the father amen and he manifested and revealed that he was a father because he became a son of man and now when you see jesus christ on the earth jesus christ is not just manifesting the son he's also manifesting the father because in order to manifest the father you have to have a son and the son manifests the father right so god needed to play both parts so that he could reveal himself in fullness because if you don't understand if god doesn't reveal all of his characteristics all of his nature then what we have is a partial revelation of god not a full revelation of god and god wanted to reveal himself in fullness so he couldn't let fatherhood stay hidden he had to express it in order to express it he had to become a son of man amen so he could express himself as a son and express himself as a father all right that's wonderful but we know that he's also a husband and if he's going to express himself as a husband what expresses husband a wife you have to have a wife to express a husband just as you have to have a son to express a father so because god also amen was a husband he had to express himself as a wife amen so that he could have the right kind of expression because it takes the right kind of wife to express what a husband is amen so god still is playing both parts it's all him expressing himself revealing himself i'm going to read that sentence again and move on he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it see he wanted to express himself that was that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in christ secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people now he could listen carefully he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated so them an original plan he was going to bring forth his son and out of his son amen came a wife and he was bringing forth offspring upon the earth which he could have done this he could have manifested himself as husband and wife he could have manifest himself as son through his son through the sonship and fatherhood he could do this express himself through adam and eve amen but but as they begin to move on the earth sin began to separate them and now he could no longer manifest himself himself that way in their flesh so i read that again he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated them so there now there had to be some way to get it back again what's been his plan of redemption what's been the plan all through the bible to get that back again amen because what god does he does perfect amen everything he does is right and correct and perfect so when god first formed this earth we see in genesis beginning in genesis 1 2 when he was reforming the earth and he brought it to an eden and he put inside this eden his son and his son's wife to rule over it amen when he did that and he looked at all that he had made and all that he'd done and he said it is very good that was a picture of perfection and it was a picture of the perfect will of god and then that picture fell because of sin and separated god from the people so that he could not manifest himself in their flesh because sin separated but now he has to have a way to get that back because that picture was the correct picture that was not a wrong picture he didn't just do it in vain he just didn't do something and try it out when he fell he says now it didn't work i'll try something else no what he did was right and perfect amen and when it fell he had to work to bring it back to that because that was the original plan that's why brother ben says when i see this seventh seal it just he said i see the seven seal revealed all the way back in the beginning in genesis it was revealed all the way back amen and the way god revealed it is absolutely so beautiful that god upon this earth would bring forth a son and that son was adam amen and we would create adam and bring him into flesh and he was both male and female amen and god we know in the message masterpiece he was creating a masterpiece and he brought forth a masterpiece it was a son thou manifested in the flesh and he placed him in eden amen when god looked at this masterpiece he created he said it is not good that man should dwell alone the question is who made him that way who put him in the garden alone god did is god making mistake no he's not making a mistake he's revealing the back part of his mind when he says it's not good that man should be alone surely he knew that he made him alone and he put him in the garden alone but he already knew that there was something in adam that would meet the need that adam had he already knew the woman was in the man he put the woman in the man so he could bring the woman out of the man and back to the man amen because it was displaying what was in the back part of his mind this mystery of the seals and this mystery of the seventh seal has been laying wide open in our bibles for thousands of years amen but it was a mystery that was sealed until the seal came off and when the seal came off it unlocked our bible so that we could go back and see that this mystery that was in the back part of god's mind has been laying in plain sight for everybody to see and we've been stumbling over it for thousands of years so when he says it is not good god is not saying i made a mistake whoops i forgot something god doesn't forget anything what he's showing you is i'm not finished yet with my masterpiece when the artist is is working on a sculpture or a painting amen you know the artist isn't done because he comes back and he chisels some more if he chisels some more then the object he's making doesn't yet match the vision he has in his mind when he comes back to his drawing or his painting or a sculpture and he's putting more brush strokes and more color and more paint then you know assuredly that he's not finished and so when god was making in those six thousand years of creation when he come to make man and he said it's not good and he continues to work then you realize he has not yet finished the picture that he had in his mind the image of his masterpiece isn't done or else when the man was here he would have sealed it then and he would have went and taken his rest and he would have stopped his work that would have been it but that wasn't it that was not what he had in his mind he had more in his mind that had to be expressed and it was evident because the artist came back to the sculptor and kept chipping the painter came back and was adding brush strokes he's not done yet so then he took out of adam and laid him to sleep smote uh him in the side took out a rib amen and took this feminist spirit out of him and formed the woman and he formed the woman and woke up the man and united the two together and then when he looked and he seen all that he had made and all that was done he said behold it is very good and brother benham said then when he saw a son in his son's bride he turned over dominion the rulership of the of the creation to them and he went and took his rest that means the masterpiece is now done the artist is finished working so what is the picture of the bible that is the picture of the bible that's why we start so many times with that story because that story is the foreshadow of everything god would do from then on until he brings it back to that image i want to keep reading in this quote and i'll read this sentence over again now he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back oh my this is rich to me just to even think of it see what god's purpose was what was he saying god's purpose was what he did in the garden that was his purpose now he's been working to bring it back to that and brother branham so rejoice he goes oh this is rich to me this is the prophet of god amen he's coming to preach christ is the mystery of god revealed which is going to be the revelation of the seventh seal something that he's known has been revealed to him that he hasn't went into great lengths to explain it to the people yet and now he's coming to explain what has been revealed to him and he's trying to show this great mystery under the seventh seal and he comes to adam and eve and he said oh this is so rich to me amen when i just think of it see what god's purpose was now why didn't he just keep adam and eve like that then he he would never be able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could have been a father there that's true but also he's a savior how do you know he was he is because i've had the experience see he is a savior and he had to express that and how could he do it only through christ how could he be a son only through christ how could he be a healer only through christ see all these things are wound up in that one person jesus christ oh my when i think of it i just see denominations pass off the scene and everything else just going see why i see god's great purpose revealing himself so what's god's great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then oh don't miss this statement hang with me i'm going to read it again i when i see the great purpose god's great purpose revealing himself and having first the first part of this great purpose to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading so when god wanted to express himself he first began to do that in jesus christ and jesus is jesus christ is the revelation of god he is the image of the invisible god but he wasn't done revealing himself yet he struck him in the side and he pulled out of him ingredients for a woman for a bride and he's been working for seven church ages to get this bride to the place that she's supposed to be because the masterpiece wasn't done yet the first part to reveal himself and reveal himself in christ fullness of the godhead bodily then to bring that fullness godhead bodily whatever was in christ to bring that fullness god had bodily into a people i want us to see that what god's doing now in his people it's not a secondary work or a second-rate work or a second class or an inferior way of revealing himself but that he brought first to reveal himself the fullness of the in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily that's how he revealed himself in christ and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily the revelation of christ into a people this is second class second rate this isn't a diminished work it's the same god continuing to manifest or reveal himself in the message the super sign the prophet says oh god if the world could only see that that god and man are one super sign was the first man that god could come into all that god was he poured into christ and all christ was he poured into the church super sign god and man together that was to be the super sign of the last day when the entire bible was to be fulfilled in the last days a super sign of virgin shall conceive and this conception when it's brought forth will be god manifested in the flesh a super sign they still don't believe it but it was anyhow it's still a super sign notice super sign they've got superman today they got fictions of superman all these other kind of super things but the church has got a super sign god back in the church manifested in human flesh god united with man his super his sure super sign notice the eternal sign on an unfailing sign it will never fail the word and man beca become one when god's word and man become one as saint john the first chapter says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and one among us that's the super sign oh if that was the super sign of that day when that same spirit that was in jesus christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today that is still the super sign [Music] so you see what god's wanting to do all that he was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into the church amen that bring the fullness of the godhead bodily and to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people what's he doing he's restoring back what fell let's turn to colossians or we are we're in colossians i'm in colossians 1 are you in colossians 1 all right let's go to verse 26. even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to a saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory i want you to remember who christ is christ is the image of the invisible god and now the revelation of this mystery among the gentiles is christ in you the hope of glory so that christ who was revealing and manifesting god is now the christ it is to come into you and what will he manifest then he will manifest god it won't be the same manifestation but it will be a manifestation of god it'll be the same thing in another form it'll be the same thing in another way in another expression the woman was a further expression of the man she wasn't different she wasn't something else she was adam we have to get this in our minds and understand that the woman was not something different than adam she was adam when he made them male and female and he called their name adam and the day that they were created they had one name one identity they were one flesh this is what this is what adam spoke when he prophesied when he saw the woman that a man shall leave his father and mother and cleveland to his wife and they too shall be one flesh when god when god made man and woman he called their name adam when god was going to make a woman he didn't do it like he did any other creature in creation amen he went back to the man because the woman was hiding in the man and when he pulled the woman out of the man she became a further expression of god is that right because god was expressing himself through a son and when that son now that son had another expression hidden inside of him and when that expression comes out into a manifestation and now it's a further expression of what was in the man and what was in the man the expression of god was in the man and there was another expression in the man of a woman so it's still god expressing himself so when the same spirit that was on jesus christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today that is still the super sign how many is looking for a sign the sign is here it's christ and his bride the fullness of the word that has been restored to a bride the headship that has been connected to the body that is the super sign friends let's turn to john 14. john 14 23 jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come into him and make our abode with him my all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into the church all that god was he poured into christ so the fullness of the godhead was bodily in christ now all that christ is where did god go to believe all that christ is he pours into the church and he says if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him that's fullness and the message christ is the mystery of god revealed again he said god expressed in jesus christ who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence is all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into the church the believers praise god in the message the unveiling of god now when it said there here that he emptied himself or poured out now we would think like this that he vomited up the english word of emptied or poured out from him seeing something went out of him that was different from him but the word kinos in the greek does not mean that he vomited up or his arm went off or his eye went out another person that is he changed himself he poured himself into into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the holy spirit but it was he himself you get it he himself poured himself into the people christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to think god pouring himself into the human being into the believer pouring out it was part of his drama to do so god all the fullness all the godhead bodily was in the person jesus christ he was god and god alone not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person god veiled in human flesh so the prophet saying when he poured out it wasn't as if god's here and he poured something out and out of him came something else and that is now something different but what he did is he poured himself into another form and jesus christ was the image of the invisible god because god poured himself into christ and then christ now what has christ done now christ has poured himself into the body of believers not poured something out but poured himself into i hope this starts clicking like it's never clicked before i hope it becomes more of a reality because we we understand by dimensions we understand by space matter time we we have these things these physics these physical properties that we understand things by we judge by distances we judge by by physical appearances amen and so we get so fixed in our mind that that when when the woman came out of adam we know we know in our minds that they are one flesh but we can't help ourselves from seeing two we see two we think two we think double we think in plural amen but when god made that creation god did not think in plural god did not see double god saw one he called it one he meant for it to be one to god it was always one amen to us in our finite minds we have such a hard time breaking ourselves from the physical world and you can see a man and you can see a woman and you can hardly stop from seeing two but god is not bound amen by the physical world when god looks down and sees what he made he sees one amen they were always one they were always destined to be one they started off as one they are still joined as one god saw one amen and so we have to understand that when god pours himself into another image you could say now now there's two now there's three now there's this and now there's that it's all god friends it's god in different ways of expressing himself in different manifestations amen in different administrations different ways of pouring himself into an image pouring himself into a manifestation it's still gone god in the word is the same so is this the word of god yes so i'm holding the written form of the word of god so dude i have all of god in my arms and my package and you have none we think so physical we think we have to have a spiritual mind to understand spiritual things god was before physics god created physics so he exists outside of physics and he exists within physics because he created physics he exists outside of gravity and he exists within gravity because he created it so he encompasses outside and inside he he he is manifest outside of time he dwells outside of time he dwells inside a time because he manifested he manufactured time he invented time he created time amen so he dwells in and out of time so is god in time yes is he out of time yes god created the unseen world god created the scene world is he in the same world yes is he in the unseen world yes which world is he in he's in both oh god help us to stop thinking like human beings and start thinking like god amen amen where am i praise god let's go to ephesians chapter 2. there's so many things in the bible we'll never understand if we stay locked into physical understanding they will never make sense we will always get them out of place and out of kilter if we don't think spiritually ephesians chapter 2 the apostle paul saying beginning in verse 19 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god through the spirit this temple that's being built of these living stones these individual stones that god has ordained and shaped and brought to this temple he's been building it over seven church ages and this building this temple is to be built together to be a habitation of god where will god dwell he'll pour himself into this habitation this dwelling place this place where god will dwell in the temple what temple the temple of his bride in christ as the mystery of god revealed he says now peter when he called he said thou are christ the son of the living god now watch blessed art thou simon barjona says which means son of jonah blessed art thou for the flesh and blood never revealed this to you you never learned it from some school but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you notice what he said to him upon this rock that's peter the predestinated seed of god that had received this light and given the keys to the kingdom upon this rock of revelation of who jesus christ is he is the full manifested god upon this rock not a father son holy ghost and him being the second person upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will never shake it down never prevail against him i'll build my church upon this rock a revelation of jesus christ look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do what's he trying to do restore back what fell in eden what a statement friends i pray god will help us to understand that i pray that god will give us supernatural revelation because it's the only way we're going to understand what the prophet is saying christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing my do you believe he meant what he said i confess i don't understand it like i ought to but i pray god will help me understand this like i ought to in the ephesians church age from the church age book he says this seven golden candlesticks in exodus 25 31 it says and you shall make a candle stick of pure gold of beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bowls his knobs his flowers shall be of the same then brother goes on to say the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold now gold is a type of deity her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect can you say that all his works are perfect are you his work are you his workmanship created in christ he's in the good works then god is doing a perfect work you can say my flesh i can see failure i can see fault but god is looking at the word amen god is looking at who you really are and he's moving you into that manifestation and his work that he's doing in his bride is perfect she is perfect because she is his workmanship it's him working amen it's not us working it's him working so so in the beginning to the end she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect listen to what he says here in fact in her is summed up and manifested the entire wisdom and purpose of god this is what the prophet of god says so before in in in the message that we were just reading in christ as the mystery of god revealed he says christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do and now in the church age book in the ephesians church age he said in fact in her is summed up and manifested the entire wisdom and purpose of god how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for god has spoken it god when he when he went to work in the masterpiece to restore back amen until god amen in the in the original masterpiece until god had brought forth the woman and brought the woman into manifestation and united her with her husband he could not rest from his works and go into his rest amen he had to finish the masterpiece before he could rest so the the the culmination or the capping or the finishing of the masterpiece was bringing forth the women woman and uniting her to her husband then after he finished that that was the period at the end of his work and he could take his rest so now god's work that he's rebuilding this masterpiece and bringing it back cannot stop cannot finish till he brings forth the woman once again and manifests the woman and unites her again with her headship with her husband then when he does that amen now he's coming to the completion of his work that's why brother branham said in her in this manifestation of a bride in the end time in her is the in fact in her is summed up and manifested the entire wisdom and purpose of god my what a statement that's why i love brother bram says who can fathom it how can we understand it we cannot do that but we accept it by faith for god has spoken you know sometimes people can start getting the impression or the understanding that we talk too much about the bride but if you have the proper understanding of revelation you're not talking about human beings in human flesh you're talking about a manifestation of jesus christ and the manifestation of jesus christ for today what god is doing today where god is at today where god is revealing himself today amen it's not talking about a person or a people and lifting up a bunch of human flesh and lumps of clay that's not what preaching on the bride is to do it's not to bring an arrogance it's not to bring a pride it's not to inflate human being amen it's to recognize the word for our day to recognize where jesus christ is manifest today what part of the book is being manifest what part of the word is coming into realization amen and it's christ it's jesus christ manifesting himself in his body his people that is the word for our day that is the revelation of this day that is the manifestation of christ today that's why christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing because what is christ in you in the end time it is god taking the man and the woman and putting them back together as one how can that not be the complete revelation of the whole thing it is the revelation of the whole thing it is his purpose and that's why brother man said in fact in her summed up and manifest the the eternal wisdom and purpose of god to manifest himself to make man in the image of god he made him male and female god manifesting himself let's turn to john 14. john 14 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you there's coming a day that you're going to realize that he's the father and we're in him and he's in us if he's in the father and we're in him and he's in us where's the father where's the godhead where's the fullness of the godhead he said at that day you shall know that i am in the father so christ is in the father then you're in christ and christ who's in the father is now in you praise be to god are you secure are you safe are you in the plan of god are you in jeopardy of being lost are you in jeopardy of not making it are you in jeopardy of not being a son of god is are you on the fence are you are you one step away from total ruin and and going to hell not if you're a son of god born again by the spirit of god you're not and the message of christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now notice god making himself known not we're not supposed to make converse to christianity by our government but by the revelation the christ in you how we make conference to christ by christ being in you and you being a living epistle and them seeing christ in you we do not make congress to christianity by government but by the revelation the christ in you as god was in christ as god was in christ christ in you so as god was in christ christ is in you so as much as god was in christ christ is in you as much as they had that relationship of oneness christ and you have the relationship of oneness now christ and you as god was in crisis god was in christ christ in you when what god did in christ christ does in you what signs did god in christ christ does in you oh isn't that beautiful oh my i like that jesus said at that day that's this day so brother graham's taking this scripture and he's applying it for you that's this day she said at that day that's this day at that day when this revelation is made known you will know that i am in the father and the father and me i in you and you and me when the revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that i and the father are one i am in the father and the father and me then when the revelation comes forth then it's i in you and you and me there you are how far away is christ where is he at praise god let's go to ephesians chapter one i said none of these things are new we've read these things we've talked about these things but they become so real and they ought to be becoming so much more real and relevant day by day ephesians chapter 1 verse 2 it says and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so what is his body his body is the fullness of him that filleth all in all let's read that again he hath put all things under his feet and give him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body so what is the church it is his body so where do you live in your body where do you live in your body so the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all christ will be expressed in fullness in his body because she is him is that what the prophet told us and the message christ is revealed in his own word he says see down through the age we start off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went into the ground the complete seed then it come out through the feet luther come back out through wesley then to pentecostals the tongues and the lips see now it's in the eyes prophetic of malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is he's talking about the church ages that body of the bride has been built up from the feet of luther through wesley amen and and then he says on up into the prophetic of malachi 4. and so forth and now there is nothing else left for it to come but for him himself to step into that so after the mystery of malachi 4 there's nothing left there's only one thing it's for jesus christ himself in fullness to step into that so that the body will be the fullness of him that filleth all in all so now there's nothing else left for it become to come but for him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no side of our own how can a man foresee those things he can't do it it's god himself it's becoming to a place and he's governing the body all the way through then the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like adam did at the beginning like adam was rather at the beginning the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride brother bram said in choosing of a bride he said the other is impregnated by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and christ is one body the word so now we have to be careful when when we look at what brother branham is telling us that we don't fall back into natural ways of viewing things in the natural world because just as much as you cannot look at adam and his bride and call them two you can only with the revelation of god call them one now he's saying now brother branham is saying and christ is one body the word now you can't say christ one body in the church one body and now we have two bodies amen your human mind will see double your human mind will see a plurality amen but the mind of god does not see plurality the mind of god sees one because when christ when jesus christ was hear flesh when the word was made flesh and dwelt among us where were you what did the prophet tell you when the word was made flesh and dwelt among us where were you amen you were in that body because you're part of that word so it was one body when jesus christ was here on earth you were in that body brother brenham said that we don't have to go to calvary and pray for our sins we've already paid for our sins on calvary because you were on calvary you were part of that body because that was the full measure of the word manifest into a body of flesh and if you're part of the word you had to be part of that manifestation part of that body amen so it was singular not plural from out of that body he takes part of that word not different word not not another thought the same thought amen when god brought forth his son upon the earth the woman was not a second thought she was not an afterthought she wasn't a secondary thought she was part of the original thought of god and when god laid adam down to pull the woman out of him he was expressing adam he was not expressing something else he was expressing adam he was not expressing eve because she did not get a name till she separated from her husband in adultery and her name is a name of adultery she didn't need a name she didn't need an identity she got another identity when she took another word but she was not supposed to have another identity she was not supposed to have another identification she was not supposed to have another name her name was adam she was part of adam she was a revelation and a manifestation of adam not another the same not adam part two adam singular adam adam male adam female adam won and christ in his body is one and you were one there on calvary and you're one here now in this world because christ has come down amen to manifest himself in his bride and it's one body manifesting the the life of jesus christ now god doesn't see plural god is looking singular i'll give you my title now i go back to remember i wrote it the bride is the manifestation of christ now that's simple we've known that but have we been saying that the bride is the manifestation of christ just as christ was the manifestation of god just as christ was the manifestation of god in this day the bride is the manifestation of christ i'm going to read some quotes to solidify that so you don't have to feel uncomfortable i'm reading out choosing my bride i'll continue to read this quote the other is pregnant by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet listen this is so beautiful when you saw in the in the pictures and the pictures of our mind we see a body on calvary and that body was the fullness of the word manufactured it was everything it was a complete body but in the mind of god the body's not complete yet because it's going to take from this body to finish making the body not another body to finish this body that's what brother was telling us the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man a man and a woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again you got that are you thinking plural or singular now amen christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body because that body is the word made flesh the bride is the word made flesh it's the same body don't think physical amen don't don't think plural don't go back to human thinking don't see a picture of one and then a picture of another think like god god is saying this came out of that and as a continuation of that this is the same body the body is expanding in manifestation when god laid adam down and took out of adam the ingredients to form the woman it wasn't a new body a many took from that body to expand the revelation of that body she was adam expanded she was the body of adam expanded manifested more fully more more vivid and more color with more brush strokes [Music] and now the bride is part of that body and she is the finishing of that body the bride will have to be the rest of the body and the two together makes the one body again what body the body of the word made flesh like adam was at the beginning man his wife are one she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word let's look at ephesians chapter five ephesians chapter 5 i'm going to read from verse 29 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes it and cherishes it even as the lord the church so the church is his own flesh not different flesh his own flesh is that right listen to what he says for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones are we part of the body of christ is this a continuation of his body this body has to come to a completion the completion of the body of christ and it has to come to a completion in this day let's look at first corinthians chapter 12. and verse 27. paul says now ye are the body of christ and members in particular see what brother branham is teaching us is nothing different than what paul the apostle taught us only the church stopped taking paul literally the church stopped believing what paul said and they started making it a mysterious somehow they started making it uh only spiritual you know nothing in this physical form they they they just started reading words with no meaning because they explained away all the meaning but what brother branham did is he brought us right back to what paul said and paul says he says paul meant what he wrote right that you are the body of christ and paul told us you are part of his flesh and of his bones a further expression of christ brother brahm says in the invisible union of the bride of christ but you remember when it went down the grain began to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stalk has to be dead hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus in the bride form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here and all that life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming into a head for the rapture brother branham says something interesting uh elsewhere in the invisible union of the bride earlier earlier on in the message starting in paragraph 67 he says and so was god manifested in the beginning and finally he was he was appeared as jehovah god the father then he appeared as god the son and jesus christ now he's appearing as god the holy ghost the same god all the time three manifestations of the same god now we find in this that each generation god has allotted his word from the beginning just like evolution came listen to what the prophet's saying now he's not believing in darwinian evolution that's not what he's talking about but he's talking about when god created and we'll just let him say it just like evolution came just like the first thing god created probably let's say he created botany life first then he created animal life then he created human life next kind of an evolution rising higher that's what brother van's referring to then in creation god started simple and he began to work his way up to more complex until finally he worked his way up to a man that was made in his image until finally what he finished with was something that reflected him on earth that was in his image is that right is that what the scripture says let us make man in our image finally what he got was something on earth that was reflecting something from the heavenlies and it was like in an evolutionary kind of way and he began to build up build up build up build up coming to the capstone amen and the man and the woman united together became the capstone of this creation and when he was done with that he went to rest and so now what the the evolution brought it all the way up into something that would reflect the very life of god and he's saying that now he's referring to that and he says that as an example then he goes on to say so so has it been in god and his church this evolutionary way justification under luther now he's going back to the church ages justification under luther that's pulling his bride out now he's creating his bride justification under luther sanctification under wesley and so forth you see the evolution of the spirit being given more and more because the body is building coming to the head which is christ the body of christ all right i'm going to read that sentence again so you don't just file it away in different places in our mind amen so you see the evolution of the spirit what's he talking about the church ages in the church ages there was an evolution of the spirit what was it doing it was building the body up what was it building it to it was building it to the head until it come to the very image of christ the husband so the the church ages was it bright all the way down through it was bright all the way down through amen mixed into the church was the bride amen there was two vines growing together we didn't understand the church ages brother ben went back and he ripped that apart and showed us not everything that was called church was church but there was a bride coming through that all along and they are part of the body they are bride just as much as you and i are bride but there's been an evolution of the spirit they didn't look like bride but through the evolution of the spirit from one age to the next age it's coming more and more into the likeness of the creator it's coming more and more into the likeness of christ himself christ brooding over the church through the church ages the holy spirit bringing them through and in the the evolution of the spirit what's it doing it's finally building the church into the headship amen when the headship and the body unite it's building it to the headship the body of christ so that at the end when the church when the bride is called out of the church ages that bride through an evolution of the spirit she the final bride that will be standing on earth at the end time will be brought into the very image of her husband it didn't look like it in martin's day didn't look like it in luther's day didn't look like it in wesley's day didn't necessarily look like it in pentecost day but there's been an evolution of the spirit amen we as bride are not different than the bride of the first stage or the second age we're all part of god all children of all god all see gene of god but god has been building an evolutionary way to where he finally gets this end time bride she will be the manifestation of the headship of christ she will be in the very image of jesus christ that's the evolution of the spirit [Music] she will be reflecting christ on this earth she will be the manifestation of christ and things that are to be he says now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom so the bridegroom is word she must be word that's why the word has been restored so that we can come subject to the word and the word can come into us and manifest through us and we can become the fullness of the word manifest in the bride to reflect jesus christ because he's the fullness of the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour that's why we're not looking anywhere else friends we're not looking for another manifestation amen we listen just listen to me and understand what i'm saying it's foolish to look for another manifestation we are the manifestation what manifestation the manifestation of christ for this day so we want to look for when this happens then we'll see something when this says listen you are what is happening god is building his headship the bride now word by word is beginning to reflect the very life of jesus christ in the formation of the bride amen it's the same life that was in adam is in the woman the same life that was in jesus christ is in the bride the same body an extension of the body the body of christ is still growing coming to the headship and now that headship has been capped by the word himself and that word has come into the bride to manifest out of the bride and she is the manifestation of this hour not the manifestation of human beings but the manifestation of christ the manifestation of the word what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living brother brennan preached this december 5th 1965. he preached this just you know just 20 or 19 days before his accident just three four weeks before he passed away this was one of his final final set of messages that he preached and brother branham as he winds down coming to the end of his ministry he is making this point so clear amen he's driving this point home after the seals and he gets into 1965 and he's trying to show you there's not another manifestation the next manifestation will be two witnesses to the jews don't look for that you are the manifestation of christ christ is here in the formation of the bride he has returned in the fullness of the word the headship has united with the bride with the body this body is his body flesh and bones if you want to see christ you must look to the bride because she has to be manifesting christ just like if you wanted to see god you had to look to jesus christ if you want to see christ in this day you must find christ because christ is the anointed word for the day where is the anointed word for the day the anointed word for the day is the capping of the church the finishing of the bride that must be manifest in a people who are the body of jesus christ the habitation of god in the end time so what are we looking for what are we waiting for waiting for something what what's next there is no next friends this is it but i'm looking for the catching away at the change in the body this brings the change of the body amen don't sit and wait for something else this word that's been restored that's becoming alive inside of us is changing our bodies amen brother branham said the sid the same spirit was in jesus christ be in you it'll quicken your mortal body and we've looked at that scripture for years as the final quickening and changing of the body but brother benham takes that scripture and says you used to smoke and you don't smoke anymore you used to drink you used to run around you are changing by the same spirit that was in him is quickening your mortal body and it'll quicken and quicken and quicken and quicken until the final quickening amen and then you will be translated into another dimension and you will see him as he is so we're not waiting we can't be waiting if we're waiting we're missing we cannot sit on our hunches and wait for the next great thing to come this is why keep looking back to brother branham and what we have to look at brother babe there's no other source for the message the message came from him but when god finished the forerunner's ministry and he used him as a wave chief he did all that he was going to do through that vessel so he took the vessel back home because he had finished his purpose he was good and faithful to the end and god took him on to his reward because the manifestation has to move from the forerunner and the wave sheath and come down to the rest of the harvest to bring it to the same ripeness that that wave sheep was at so if we keep looking back to the wave shape we should look to the wave sheet for encouragement but if we look for the wave sheath to come back the wave she won't come back it's already been harvested remember once the wave chief is taken out of the field it's never taken back to the field it's taken a head wave before the lord is an offering and taking to the same place the rest of the harvest will go we can't look back we can't look forward the only thing we can do is realize where he's at brother ben said how can we fathom it how can we understand it i don't know that we'll ever completely understand it in these bodies i don't know that we'll ever completely fathom it with these minds but friends we're not going anywhere until we accept it we're not gaining any ground until we accept it amen we accept doctrines and we accept teachings and we accept this and that but what we must accept today is the manifestation of the hour and the manifestation of the hour is christ and the formation of his bride and we can believe everything that brother venom did and everything that he said and everything that he taught but if we're still doubting who we are we're still waiting for something to come and confirm something to come and bring evidence something to show me the next step if we're still sitting waiting we're missing the manifestation and we're missing who we are and we're living below our privileges and we're sitting on our haunches waiting for something to happen when we are the thing that is supposed to be happening i'm going to read that quote one more time we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be the word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living i don't know how you can miss it i don't know how we can believe it any other way the prophet made it so plain the manifestation of the hour is a people on the earth who are the living oracle of god who are the living attribute of god not waiting to live but living displaying to the world not waiting to display but displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride do you believe you're part of the bride then you're part of this manifestation then the manifestation of christ is in you then you are the manifestation of this hour not you singularly but you as part of a body you are part of this manifestation of this hour there is nothing to wait for we're here to take this word and live it we're here to take this word and believe it we're here to say whatever you say i am i'll say amen to because i have to receive your word and if your prophet said this is what i am even though i can see faults i can see frailties i can see inabilities i can see my own stumblings amen i cannot look at the natural anymore and make it one step further i've got to look to what a prophet of god said in this day because he was vindicated to make the statements that he made and the statements that he made were exactly what the apostle paul taught us [Music] and we have to get beyond ourselves and look to god amen that's why this message could carry us beyond our thinking beyond denominational thinking beyond thousands of years of church history and take us back to the original thought of god before the foundation of the world and if you by faith can find yourself in that thought then you are here to express what he thought there to express it here and that thought is an actual physical part of god because what about the thoughts of god they are literal are they not those thoughts are attributes those attributes are seed genes those thoughts are literal parts of god and god has sown that part of the earth that part of himself into a vessel of clay amen so that this vessel of clay by the anointing of his spirit can express that thought in this day you say but brother chad i haven't won souls i haven't preached in the corner he wants to express that thought in a janitor and he wants to express that thought and a preacher he wants to express that thought and a sunday school teacher he wants to express that thought and a mom that thought and a dad that thought in a teenager that thought in a child who will say i believe the word that thought and and a widow or a widower or a single amen this thoughts god knew where you would be god knew you would be in the condition you're in there's no reason to sit around and pow amen and puff and snort about how bad my condition is god before the foundation of the world knew you would be in this condition and he ordained one of his thoughts his attributes to express christ in your condition in your marriage situation and your problems from the past and you're difficult in finances and your and your inabilities and you're all of this he chose before the foundation of the world knowing what you would be in this hour you say how can god use me i'm in this situation how can god use thee me i'm all alone how can god use me i have no talents or abilities who gives talents or abilities how can you sin say i can't serve god he didn't give me what i needed what are you saying about the plan of god well if god will give me this then i'll do this god has given you exactly what you need march forward and believe that if he said that i'm part of the bride and the bride is the manifestation of this hour then i am the manifestation of christ for this hour god wants to manifest through me he wants to show his love he wants to show his character he wants to show his characteristics when i'm at work when i'm at the grocery store when i'm with my family when i'm with believers when i'm with unbelievers he wants to show himself in this vessel amen if we can really catch that every moment of every day it'll change the way you shop for groceries you will not be bumping your cart to get first in line anymore it'll change the way we live when we realize that this is the truth we want so many things in our lives to change but what needs to change is our revelation and our understanding because with the right revelation our actions automatically start changing we'll believe that the bride is the manifestation of the word for this hour we believe that but when it comes down to the personal every day the words coming out of the mouth the actions that we we begin to take that personal manifestation of christ and we begin to spread it globally over the bride because it's easy that revelation is easy that god has a body on the earth absolutely they are the body of christ they are manifesting christ that body globally and that's the truth that's a true revelation but it's so easy to hide an individual responsibility under the cloak of a global bride but the revelation brother benham said is to the individual one person all hell is against this revelation the revelation to the individual saying that the bride is the manifestation of this hour that's fine you can repeat that you can say that you can believe that but faith has to go deeper and say you know what say like apostle paul i'm not worthy to be called bride i'm not worthy paul said i'm not worthy to be called an apostle he said i'm least of the apostles and not worthy to be called an apostle because i've persecuted the church he's looking at his own human failures he said i'm least of the apostles and not worthy to be called an apostle but by the grace of god i am what i am you know what i may be least of his bride and i can assure you i'm not worthy to be called bride i can assure you and if you want a list of reasons why i'm not worthy come and see me afterwards i can give you i can fill tablets full of reasons why i'm not worthy to be bride a lot of stuff i did years ago stuff i've done in the last week or two but is there something in you that can say i'm least i'm not even worthy i shouldn't even take this title but by the grace of god i am what i am he's put a revelation in my heart that says whatever that brother's preaching whatever that brother's saying on that message tape and when i read this book that's me i know it's me when i look into the mirror of the word i know it's me i know i'm not worthy i know i shouldn't be i know i can't do it but it's me it's me mama it's me i'm looking at me when brother brahm takes us to the back part of god's mind and he begins to explain what god was thinking and doing something inside of us says that's familiar territory i was there i don't have any conscious memory of it but something down inside of me is jumping and leaping at the thought that i was there and now i am here because he has a purpose for my individual life for that thought that attribute amen is here to manifest christ in this hour and i refuse to wait another day for something else to happen everything that's supposed to happen to get me to manifest christ has already happened but i have to believe what he said about me and i have to move forward with faith saying if there's anybody on this earth that is supposed to be a living word a living epistle jesus christ in flesh it's got to be me because that's what my revelation tells me who i am and if nobody else can take that position i can take that position what does that mean what will we do next brother chad go do the same thing you did the day before stay where god planted you be where god put you be who he called you to be but be christ in that tabernacle let the word rule let his life let his spirit his life take dominion the second fold of his great threefold purpose would get three eminence in a people so what what are we to do you know we can't do much i'm talking humanly speaking what can you do what can you change can you change your circumstances can you change humanly speaking there's very little that you can do you can't do anything but i know that with him all things are possible it's not what i can do because that's not what god wants but it's what i can surrender myself to that he can come and do through me that's the works he wants to do he does not want you and i to do works because all of our works is his filthy rags so if we are doing our works that's filthy rags but if he comes in through us and does his works that's works of righteousness so it's not what we can do it's what we can surrender ourselves to brother brennan said i wasn't the one who said those things i wasn't the one who appeared on the river i wasn't the one who told those things that would happen i was only standing near when he did that because god did not want brother branham to do his own works he wanted brother branham amen to surrender to him so he could get preeminence in that man and through preeminence in that man that man could manifest christ did brother brenda manifest christ praise god how through surrender through giving preeminence that's our wrestling match that's our battle that's where we're fighting every day is to give him a greater preeminence brother braham goes on to say in the message god's provided place of worship now jesus himself excuse me at that day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself so what is the son of man ministry the ministry of jesus christ himself the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through the baptism of the holy ghost or the pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man when husband and wife will be the same self persons is it two or is it one what does god see christ in you the hope of glory christ in his body the headship has come to the body making one unit not two one god will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at where is he at where is he at i'm watching for him you've missed it because he's here in bride form and the message turned on the light he says and from the from the ripening of the grain from all the way back from luther all the way down through the age it ought to be the fullness of the gospel now the power of god ripen the light that's been shown through justification sanctification the pentecostal age ought to ripen the bride tree for the coming of the lord jesus christ that christ could be manifested in his church as one person so what is the coming of the lord jesus christ that christ could be manifested in his church as one person it's christ in you the hope of glory him and his wife him and his bride amen this is the hour we're living this is the light of the day walk in it be saved all the ends of the earth what is the life of the a jesus christ coming down into his body and being one person the message christ has revealed in his own word he says now the next thing happens is when it's all gathered up into that one person jesus christ bride and body at the physical return of the lord jesus making his three times when he was brought on earth killed crucified raised up manifesting himself in the form of his body which is his bride the woman you get it she is part of his body let's turn to romans chapter 8. i want to read two more scriptures romans chapter 8. and verse 28. romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them who love god to them who are the cult according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren friends we have been predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son just as jesus christ was the image of the invisible god we've been predestinated to be conformed into the image of the sun so that now the image of the sun is reflected in the bride let's go to ii corinthians chapter 3 and verse 17. ii corinthians 3 17. now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face behold as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image jesus became the image of the invisible god but we through an open face of revelation of the word on this last day are looking into a glass this word and as we look into the word in the glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord the bride is coming into the image of the bridegroom the bridegroom is reflected in the bride she is here to manifest him she is his body she is the habitation of god she is the abode of christ she is where his spirit is dwelling she is manifesting the word for this day in the message when their eyes were open they knew him lord let bible readers hear tonight see the truth let them see that malachi 4 that this anointing is supposed to come and to restore back again that faith that the father's once seen the revelation of god in christ now may they see the revelation of god in human beings christ manifested in the flesh of his church walking among us praise god i hope we're becoming convinced and the seed is not heir with the shuck he says yeah that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience same life for when god separated adam he was both we find out adam was spirit to begin with he made him in his own image created he male and female and then genesis 2 and on he created man out of the dust of the earth man was created in his image god is spirit so he's a spirit man then when he became flesh man animal flesh on the earth he is showing portraying here the bride he never taken and made another being oh that's good he never taken and made another being but he took part of adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took the feminist spirit out of adam left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminist part therefore part of his spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to christ brother very clearly said he never taken and made another being the woman was not another being she was another part of the same being first corinthians chapter 11. we're coming to the finish but stay with me i want to read a few more first corinthians 11 verse 7. first corinthians 11 and 7 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of god beautiful but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man so the man was the image and glory of god when god created a man that man was reflecting god on the earth but the woman was the glory of the man she was reflecting the man and when jesus christ come he was the image of the invisible god he was reflecting god but out of christ would come his bride and his bride would be united back to him and now his bride is the glory of her husband she is the manifestation she is the revelation of christ in this hour and the message modern events may clear by prophecy he says and so will the church come through justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost restoration of the gifts right on into the formed image of christ christ the bridegroom the church is the bride and the bride is part of the bridegroom so from justification you go to sanctification from sanctification to the baptism holy ghost which brother branham calls the restoration of the gifts and from there where do you go next right on into the formed image of christ what is the end time bride the formed image of christ the evolution of the spirit has brought her all the way up to where now this bride on the earth in the end time is in the image of her bridegroom christ is the mystery of god revealed and his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing but he was identified by god being the body that god dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing oh let's read that again but he was identified by god being the body that god dwelled in so who was jesus christ he was identified by god being the body that god dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing what is she she is the body that he's dwelling in she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it do you think you'll get anybody else to agree with you do you think we'll get any of the denominations to agree that christ is in his bride and his bride has been called out by the message of the hour you cannot be bride until you're called out by the message of the hour if your bride you will be called out of the nomination by the message of the hour you won't stay in denomination you will be called out by the message of the hour and you will be called out and united with your bridegroom which is the restored word amen and under that unification unite with the with the bridegroom the headship now comes to the body and now you are the manifestation of the hour you are the manifestation of the word for this hour and christ is the word the anointed word for the hour and you are his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and you cannot find it anywhere else that stumbles people so bad but we know where christ is we know where the word has been restored and we should not be ashamed of that because when we're ashamed of that we're denying people access to christ because the word did not come amen to keep us all in our systems the word came to bring us to christ to unite with christ so that christ could dwell in us in fullness through the evolution of the spirit so that this end time bride can be formed into the very image of jesus christ and we cannot be afraid of that we cannot be ashamed of that because that is the message the message is not just restoring doctrines the restoration of the doctrines was to put the church back in order amen to bring her into an invisible union with christ her mate to the headship could unite with the body so that the body could reflect the very life of the bridegroom amen and be a manifestation of christ in full measure in this day that's the message so we can't just tell somebody about water baptism and say you stay in your system and just be baptized in water the right way no you come all the way into christ and christ will come all the way into you and in that day you'll know that he's in the father the father and him he's in you and you're in him and the very manifestation of this hour is living in you and she and she alone stands by it and that's what the devil's howling about the promise of this word being in her alone what does the devil hate what does systems hate why do even people who claim to believe the message they hate they hate the fact that this truth is in her only that the ark is the message that christ is the word and that word is formed into a bride in this last day and outside of that there's no way to be saved in this end time that it is the ark of safety that it is the rescue from the world that it is the escape from the tribulation it is found the word is found in her amen it's not her it's in her manifesting through her we either believe the message or we don't we can believe what happened but everybody has always been able to believe what happened and the further distance you get away from the event the easier it is to believe what happened that's the way it's always been it's always been confusing in the day when the word is manifest there's always been a turmoil of fight and always been a minority that would receive it but the further you get away from that manifestation the easier it is to receive just like they could not accept joan of arc being a prophetess that she couldn't accept her being spiritual so they killed her but years later they realized that she was spiritual so they dug up those priest bones that had her killed and they threw them in the river because now they're believers hundreds of years later so it's easy to believe what was but where's the challenge the challenge is always believing what is the present tense manifested word where is jesus christ he's on earth he is in a body of flesh right now what flesh your flesh my flesh the flesh of his body which is his church which is his bride that has been called out by a prophetic message in the end time and sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost when the word was released and come back upon a people the headship and the body has united signifying the capstone seals the building and says this is my place of abode and it's in her and her only and she stands alone upon this word but if you're ashamed of that you're denying people the truth because this is the truth it is the only truth for this day it is the manifestation of the word in this hour it is the place of salvation it is the ark of safety it is the place of the rapture it's in him and he's in her and the word has come to her again we shouldn't be afraid to tell people peter paul james and john they had a message of salvation and they preached it true because it was the only way for their day old paschal lamb had failed and now had become the lamb of god and they could not continue to say you're fine you're fine you're fine they said no you're no longer fine there you're no longer it's no longer okay to go back and do what we've done for now the lamb of god has come and he's been slain and when those priests lifted him up now it moved from the paschal lamb to the lamb of god but brother benham said it was it was the lamb and luther's day and it was the lamb and wesley's day what does he mean looking back to the slain lamb he said but now it's token time now it's not looking back but now it's looking to who has come it's token time the very life of jesus christ has entered into his bride he is here there is a place of safety that's in him in the message the identification of christ in all ages said heavenly father we are grateful to see the risen messiah 1900 years of all kinds of theology and movements but still in the darkness of all of it you promised that you would appear here in the last days in the sodom day and you would make yourself known to the children of abraham the called the elected and here you are tonight after 1900 years you're just as much alive tonight as you was when you talked to the woman at the well it's god manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the same self flesh this is why i told you i was going to read a lot this morning because the prophet can say it he's got the authority and the vindication to say it but i have by grace that's given to me the faith to say that's nothing but the truth i didn't have the vindication to say it i didn't have the authority to make that statement but i by the grace that god has given to me by faith that's been planted deep in my heart i have the authority to say that's nothing but the truth i believe it exactly that way amen the bride and the husband is the self-same flesh these two are one and the church is becoming the bride listen to this the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word i want to be the bride make me bride the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word what word the restored word by believing the the sorry the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word in the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign the last sign god identifying himself the word in the church what are you looking for i can tell you don't look any farther if you want to find him he's here he's in bright form the word has come and the word is in her and there is a mouthpiece of god on the earth in the end time and the bride under her prophet is the final voice to the final age what is her voice crying come out from among them and be separate and he will receive you and the message of christ is the mystery of god revealed this is the i believe the last quote that i read he said oh if i could get the word to see that if i could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed oh my justified in his sight why are we justified we are his victory let that soak in that you are his victory it's not your victory it's his victory it's not what you want it's what he wants it's not what you're doing it's what he's doing it's not your victory it's his victory the church is his victory you come forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right and we're already potentially arise because we've raised from dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to an eternal word of the eternal god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and then the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife they are flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit amen how do you know it bears the same record same fruit same word see manifest christ the same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same signs the things that i do shall you also oh hallelujah my did you catch how many times he said same not different same notice the vindicated word in his body is his victory and the reason of his death if we don't have the vindicated word in his body then he died in vain but the reason of his death and his victory is the vindicated word in his body he wanted to come to his body he wanted to be united with the bride again to restore eden again the vindicated word in his body is his very victory in the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that right his flesh only died when he raised it up again and quickened him quicker means man made alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years catch this so his flesh which is the word has been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation did he say his body his body which is the word his body is his male his his body listen i'm going to take two objects here okay his body has been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation but i thought what was coming up in the reformation was her body i'm seeing plural again but brother branham is not speaking plural he is not speaking double he is not speaking of two bodies when we read something like that we automatically go his body's been like his body which is the word because he's the word made flesh has been laying dead for years but has gradually come up in the reformation and as soon as he say come up reformation you start seeing her body but her body is his body it is the body he dwells in it is the body he lives in in the end time it is the body that he is expressing through her body is his body and listen to what he says and that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she is standing upon her feet who's she she is he his body is now her standing on her feet she's come through the reformation through luther through wesley through the restoration of gifts and now into the formed image of jesus christ because we with an open face have been beholding in a glass darkly the glory of the lord are being changed into the same image what image the image of the word what is the word jesus christ by the revelation of the hour that has taken the veil off has given us a looking glass to look into and as we behold the lord of glory we are being changed into the same image that we're seeing from glory unto glory until you keep looking so long that you become him and he becomes you and he is she and in that day you'll know that i am in the father the father in me i in you and you and me and brother ben when he reads it he says making them all one she is now now she is standing upon her feet oh how i wish i had time to go back and do ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and show you he said can these bones live again he said prophesy how can prophecy come only through the prophet it's the word of the lord hear hear ye dry bones the word of the lord and sin you skin came upon them and they stood up a mighty army and began to march toward zion glory to god that's him that's him the victory what is his victory in the reason of his death the manifested word in his church he living his life in the bride in the end time is his victory and the purpose of his death and the revelation of christ in you makes you the revelation of the whole thing god help us to understand that god bless you friends let's all stand i just want to encourage you in the lord don't resist this truth even while i preach i can feel resistance some people are afraid to go that far but the prophet went that far this is not what i said this is what the prophet said i tried to read as much as i could read so you could see what the prophet himself taught us and and you can say but i just don't see it you don't see it because you haven't yet surrendered to it because you haven't went into it you still are hesitant because you don't want to be a fanatic you don't want to go too far you don't want to you don't want to move and find out you're wrong so you're staying on the fence and just touching the foot in the water and you'll never catch the revelation it'll always be a confusion until you say there's something in me pulling me there's something true and i am going to abandon myself and stop protecting myself and i'm going to enter into this word that has been restored to this prophet and let that word protect me amen because you we're never going to get anywhere until we say that man of god is a prophet of god he either is or he isn't there is no halfway in this friends there is no finding where he's right and finding where he's wrong and trying by our own understanding to navigate where he's right and where he's wrong and where he's too far and listen you're never going to go anywhere amen you're going to be 10 years from now exactly where you are right now with that mentality or you may be worse off you may be a total infidel disbelieving christ but how does she become the bride by letting the bride by letting the word by believing the word the church is becoming the bride by believing the word and letting it be true and confessing it's true and lining up our thinking to what god has given us in this day from the scriptures and say that is nothing but the truth and when hattie wright who had no education no spiritual training just a simple woman when she heard the prophet say something that was impossible something that had never been done in the history of mankind something happened that jesus himself didn't even do created something from nothing not even jesus christ when he broke bread he started with bread and broke more bread he started with fish and broke more fish but he never created something from nothing and here brother branham is talking to hattie wright and he's talking to her about something that's impossible for a man to do in himself and something that has never been done in the bible outside of god himself man had created but god told him what to say moses created in the bible but god said call for flies he called for flies here we have a story where he says whatever you say he's given the power of creation and that woman hears this and she doesn't say brother what scriptures are you referring to can you show me some examples in the bible that simple woman said that's nothing but the truth that's nothing but the truth and it's so pleased god it didn't please that prophet it pleased god it so pleased god that the power of god fell in that room and said give her whatever she wants the prophet of god stood up said god says whatever you want you can have and she says what should i ask what should i what should i do what and he says well your parents are poor they need money brother ben is giving her suggestions your sister's bound on a wheelchair she could be healed and she said the thing i want most look at the character of the woman is the salvation of my two boys brother ben said i give them to you in the name of the lord jesus christ and they fell over repenting what was it that pleased god so much that he would come to a humble woman that nobody in the world hardly knows that is poor and uneducated and she'll never make a big impact on the world other than the story that brother ben told but he comes to this woman he was so pleased what was he pleased with he was pleased with somebody that didn't have to be educated into believing he was pleased with somebody that could hear what god was doing and have something in her that would leap out and say that is nothing but the truth she didn't say i could see that happening that might be right she made a bold declaration that that put her on the line she said that is nothing but the truth i want the kind of faith that pleases god like that i want to hear the prophet saying see that he's he's preaching to me out of the word he's been vindicated to give this message and when he preaches this message i want something in me that could stir up and say that's nothing but the truth not say where did you get that scripture brother branham would you show me some examples out of the bible my if we would just believe the word if there's something in us to believe it then god will show you all the scriptures and show you all the examples out of the bible [Music] we're waiting to be educated in the faith and god just wants people who believe the word and there is a wisdom and there is a knowledge in god and god has a knowledge of the word that he'll give you but he won't give it to you to educate you into believing he'll give it to those who believe when you believe and can express your faith in god god has all kinds of knowledge he can build this scripture and this scripture and this this story and this parable and all of a sudden you're like how could i not see this before it's everywhere in the word it takes respect for god and respect for his word and that respect for god and respect for his word unlocks the kingdom of god and unlocks revelation and knowledge and wisdom but if we're trying to use our mind and be educated this bible will stay sealed and it'll stay locked but i want to be as simple as how he writes when i hear the word something in me knows it's true i've heard the prophet of god say things before that my heart jumped for joy and my brain says that's no way have you ever been there but something inside has to override this and say but he's the prophet of the age and when you when something inside overrides this all of a sudden by the grace of god you'll be driving down the road or reading your bible or listen to the message and all sudden bang there it is right in the bible it was there all along amen but if i would have used my mind i would have rejected the truth i said god let there be something in me rise up that can accept this word by faith and a prophet of god says that this bride is in his very image that jesus christ and the bride of christ are becoming the same flesh i want to say that's nothing but the truth let it be true in this flesh here lord let that same spirit that raised you from the dead dwelling me and keep quickening this mortal body to match that word we must surrender to the word in order to have the life of the word and without the life of the word we'll never produce the life of christ but we must surrender to the word to receive the life of the word and then the life of the word will live the word praise god let's bow our hands lord jesus we thank you for your word oh god we may be may we have a faith that pleases you lord may we believe you lord in all of your power and all of your majesty may we believe lord what you've taught us through the prophet of the age for you wasted no effort in vindicating this man you stopped at nothing you you so backed up his word and vindicated him so many times through supernatural lord that we cannot deny that you have vindicated that you yourself have put your seal of approval on this prophet help us to believe what you've taught us through that prophet god show us your word and let us walk in that word give us a heart to believe a heart to receive all that you have for us and unlock our understanding that we might understand the scriptures open our eyes of understanding help us to not stay locked in in three-dimensional thinking not stay locked into the natural realm but unlock us lord that we might see the truth and reality of your word in this day god we receive it as truth we believe it's the truth we want to walk and we even accept that it's us lord that by faith it's us it's me as an individual that you've called that this revelation is to one person to the individual and this revelation has come to me as an individual and i accept it now in the name of jesus christ that i am what i am by your grace lord god i pray that you would unlock to me understanding unlock to me the power of your word and your spirit that you can come down and live that life through me that you've ordained for this day for without you i can do nothing lord but with you all things are possible let each one of us have faith in what you've called us in what you've told us that we are and may we surrender lord to that with all of our hearts and give you preeminence and let you live through us and may you manifest through us to this world who you are in this age and god may others see the light and come to the light god we want to manifest your word because we love you but we want to manifest your word because we want to see souls saved and once the others lord come to the light lord may you shine a bright light through each of us that others may see and find their way to the same source that we found may they come to you lord and be forever changed and become part of that body that is manifesting your life we surrender to you lord take us and use us for your glory manifest through us i pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless you brother ben he's the same god who spoke to the woman at the well the same god whose wonders the raging red sea [Applause] he's the same god who spoke to the
