[0:01] [Music]
[0:10] lord
[0:12] to thy precious
[0:20] [Music]
[0:22] amen god bless you this evening let's
[0:25] just take our bibles and go right to the
[0:27] word here we're going to write to
[0:28] matthew 21. and it's been said a few
[0:31] times already but i want to say happy
[0:32] veterans day to the veterans out there
[0:34] so grateful and appreciate so much all
[0:36] you've done
[0:38] amen we're so thankful to still live in
[0:40] a country where we can do this
[0:42] where we can be free and we know that
[0:44] that privilege won't always be here so
[0:46] we want to take advantage of it while we
[0:47] can
[0:48] it'd be sad to someday see the doors of
[0:50] this church close down and think
[0:52] i missed a lot of services because i was
[0:53] a little tired and i could have been
[0:55] there so i appreciate you all coming out
[0:57] on a wednesday night
[0:58] amen let's take a look at matthew 21
[1:03] verse 21.
[1:06] jesus answered and said unto them verily
[1:08] i say unto you if you have faith and
[1:10] doubt not
[1:11] you should not only do this which is
[1:12] done to the fig tree but also if you
[1:14] shall say unto this mountain
[1:16] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:18] the sea it shall
[1:20] be done let's just bow our heads and ask
[1:22] the lord to bless the reading of his
[1:23] word
[1:24] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[1:26] for this word
[1:27] we come to you today in the name of
[1:29] jesus christ asking lord
[1:30] that you would break the bread of life
[1:32] to us this morning this evening lord
[1:34] that you would open your word and pour
[1:35] it into our hearts and forever change us
[1:37] by your word
[1:38] lord you're molding us and you're
[1:40] shaping us lord by the chisel of your
[1:42] word
[1:42] lord i pray that tonight you would do a
[1:44] further work in my life
[1:46] that you would just hone out that that
[1:48] character of christ in me using your
[1:49] word
[1:50] i ask that you take these lips of clay
[1:52] and use them for your glory give us
[1:53] years to hear and hearts to perceive all
[1:55] you have for us this evening
[1:57] in jesus christ's name amen you can be
[2:00] seated
[2:01] i just want to remind everybody while
[2:03] you're being seated of the weekend
[2:05] meetings this weekend with brother
[2:06] abraham myra
[2:08] we have a saturday night service at
[2:09] seven sunday morning is our normal time
[2:12] but then we've added a sunday afternoon
[2:14] service at four
[2:16] and brother abraham has a wonderful
[2:18] testimony
[2:19] and it's it's really out of this world
[2:21] when i say out of this world i mean out
[2:22] of this world supernatural
[2:24] and so i think it would be quite a
[2:25] blessing so we're going to ask him to
[2:26] come back at 4 00 p.m
[2:28] and we're not going to have a song
[2:29] service or anything we're just going to
[2:31] have a testimony service and give him
[2:32] plenty of time
[2:33] to share his testimony what god's done
[2:36] for him is
[2:36] miraculous it's wonderful it's exciting
[2:40] and i know it'll be a blessing you know
[2:43] i mentioned before but brother abraham
[2:45] brother abraham holds the office of a
[2:47] prophet and he's gifted that way and he
[2:49] has that ministry and has been confirmed
[2:51] by many
[2:51] and so we're excited to have him here he
[2:54] also pastors a church in uganda a church
[2:56] of
[2:57] 700 people from what i understand so he
[3:00] he's quite active and quite busy and
[3:02] god's really blessed him so
[3:04] i think it'll be a blessing to you so i
[3:05] encourage you to come out
[3:07] seven o'clock on saturday also there's
[3:10] one other thing i want to
[3:11] i want to announce before we get right
[3:13] into to the scriptures here and the word
[3:16] um we decided to take another
[3:20] field trip with our youth group up to a
[3:22] mega church up in toledo
[3:24] we did this about six years ago and it
[3:26] was quite an eye-opening experience for
[3:28] all of us who were able to go
[3:30] so we're going to plan that again for
[3:32] not this coming saturday but the
[3:33] following saturday
[3:35] november the 21st we'll be meeting here
[3:37] at 2 30 in the afternoon
[3:40] here in the fellowship hall and we'll
[3:42] carpool
[3:43] our way up there and it would be very
[3:45] good for
[3:46] the the youth in this church to see what
[3:48] brother branham's talking about
[3:51] you know uh i'd say most of the young
[3:53] people in the church have been raised in
[3:55] the message
[3:56] and don't really have many experiences
[3:58] outside of this assembly here
[3:59] or assemblies like this or camps or
[4:01] whatever and it would be really
[4:03] it's really an experience to go and see
[4:06] everything that brother branham was
[4:07] talking about in 1950s and 1960s
[4:11] now we're here 50 years later and to see
[4:14] what it actually
[4:15] everything he said is actually taking
[4:16] place things that nobody in his day
[4:19] believed would happen
[4:20] that the church would be led by rock and
[4:21] roll music they didn't believe it in the
[4:23] 1960s nobody believed that
[4:25] but now it's happening and you'll get a
[4:26] chance to see that if you take this trip
[4:30] and so we're going to put a sign up
[4:31] sheet out for the weekend for all the
[4:33] kids who want to sign up to go
[4:34] we want to get a good head count so we
[4:36] know what to do about transportation
[4:38] and any parents that are willing to
[4:39] drive up if you've got a minivan or a
[4:41] vehicle
[4:42] that'll hold many if you want to drive
[4:43] if you could sign up we'll have a
[4:44] separate spot for you
[4:46] the list you know that you want to go
[4:48] and how many that you can take so we
[4:50] make sure everybody has a ride up there
[4:52] and we want to make sure that this is
[4:54] for the youth in our church anybody can
[4:56] go up anytime
[4:57] i mean it's an open door church they
[4:58] have 2 500 people that go through there
[5:01] through the weekend but we don't want to
[5:03] show up with 150 people
[5:05] so let's be conscious of how many we
[5:07] take and how many go we want to
[5:09] primarily do this for the young people
[5:11] amen i think that's it
[5:15] man we're going to do like we did last
[5:16] time i think we did it six years ago i
[5:18] think it was six years ago when we did
[5:19] that
[5:20] and we're going to stop on the way back
[5:22] and get a bite to eat so we can talk
[5:24] about the things we've seen and
[5:25] experienced
[5:26] and kind of have some time to share with
[5:28] one another so i think that'd be
[5:29] beneficial so we'll have that sign up
[5:31] sheet this weekend so make sure you sign
[5:32] up for that
[5:33] if you have any questions just give me a
[5:35] call and we'll work it out
[5:37] so we want to get back to the word right
[5:38] now we're gonna we got the scripture in
[5:40] matthew 21 which is very very familiar
[5:42] passage of scripture
[5:43] if you say unto this mountain be thou
[5:45] removed and be cast into the sea it
[5:47] shall be done
[5:48] and brother branham admitted that this
[5:49] scripture had baffled him for many many
[5:51] years
[5:52] and so he we're going to get into god
[5:54] giving him the revelation of this
[5:56] scripture
[5:57] but we're going to wrap up our our bible
[5:59] study on esther tonight
[6:01] lord willing this is titled the rise of
[6:03] the queen part 3 the third pool so we're
[6:06] gonna talk about the third pool
[6:08] in the ministry of esther it's amazing
[6:10] that esther has so much
[6:12] in ten little chapters ten little
[6:15] chapters we found
[6:16] vashti the queen put away for refusing
[6:18] the king we found the seven chamberlains
[6:20] which are the seven church age
[6:21] messengers
[6:22] we've sound we we've seen haggai the
[6:25] ministry of brother branham ministering
[6:27] to the virgins and
[6:28] we've seen the the virgins go before the
[6:30] king and the king choose one out of all
[6:32] of them for the queen and so we've seen
[6:34] the rise of the queen esther coming into
[6:36] power
[6:37] and we've been through all of that and
[6:38] we've seen her revelation of her
[6:40] position
[6:41] as she first starts off humbly afraid to
[6:44] approach to the king because she doesn't
[6:45] know
[6:46] what the king really feels about her she
[6:48] doesn't really know she knows she's
[6:50] called because all the fair young
[6:51] virgins were called
[6:52] she knows she's chosen because god the
[6:54] king chose her
[6:55] out of all of the fair young virgins so
[6:58] she knows she's called she's no she's
[6:59] chosen
[7:00] but she doesn't know the access she has
[7:02] to the king
[7:03] and she doesn't really know how the king
[7:05] would feel about her so we find her
[7:07] in early on in in esther
[7:10] fasting for three days and having all of
[7:12] her kindred fast for three days
[7:14] because she's going to go into the king
[7:16] unbidden now if the king called for you
[7:18] to come it was no big deal but if you
[7:20] decided to go to king
[7:21] on your own of your own choosing that
[7:23] was a big deal
[7:24] because any who did so and wasn't
[7:26] received by the king was killed
[7:29] because it was death to go into the holy
[7:31] of holies we found the same thing in the
[7:33] in the book of leviticus in the old
[7:36] testament to go into the holy of holies
[7:38] where the throne of god was
[7:39] where his seat was was death except only
[7:43] one person the high priest
[7:44] one day out of the year could go and not
[7:46] without blood but any time he would
[7:48] approach the wrong way
[7:50] not when he was bid and not of his own
[7:51] free will but if he had approached
[7:53] the wrong way he would be smitten dead
[7:56] and so now we find esther the queen
[7:58] which is the type of the church
[8:00] she doesn't know that she has free
[8:02] access to the king
[8:04] she's worried about this old law amen
[8:07] and so now she finds out that the king
[8:10] the king delights in her
[8:12] and she knows this because when he saw
[8:13] her come in with the royal apparel and
[8:15] the royal apparel is the word she's
[8:17] clothed in the word
[8:18] and she comes in with the royal apparel
[8:19] and he extends the golden scepter under
[8:21] her
[8:22] and we found out that the golden scepter
[8:24] was the symbol of power and authority or
[8:26] the symbol of the kingdom
[8:27] which is the word of god and it was
[8:29] extended unto her and she received that
[8:31] extension of mercy
[8:33] by coming up and placing her hand on top
[8:35] of the scepter
[8:36] and so she found that mercy was extended
[8:38] and mercy was received
[8:40] amen and it's extension of the word of
[8:42] god
[8:43] but then she finds out exactly what's in
[8:45] the mind of the king when he says what
[8:47] is your request
[8:48] and it'll be given to thee up to half of
[8:51] my kingdom
[8:52] and that's when esther finds out that
[8:54] she's a joint heir with christ
[8:56] amen that she gets up to half the
[8:58] kingdom amen
[9:00] so it's a far cry from being afraid
[9:01] you'll be slaughtered to all the sudden
[9:03] being
[9:04] a half half the joint heir having half
[9:06] the kingdom
[9:08] virtually handed to you so last time we
[9:11] talked about
[9:13] on sunday we talked about the the two
[9:15] comings of the king
[9:17] first she comes into the king's inner
[9:18] chamber and she's accepted there
[9:20] then she invites the king to her inner
[9:22] chamber to her banquet of wines and when
[9:24] she come when he comes
[9:26] we find out that haman's there because
[9:27] haman's always there right
[9:29] and esther's in esther's banquet of wine
[9:31] in esther's house
[9:32] is haman the evil one the enemy of the
[9:35] jews but
[9:36] she's also invited the king to come now
[9:37] the king has come to her inner chamber
[9:39] but it wasn't on the third day it wasn't
[9:42] the first coming of the king that gave
[9:44] her deliverance over haman
[9:45] but it was the second coming of the king
[9:47] on the fourth day
[9:49] all right because we're going to pick up
[9:50] our story in the fourth day so on the
[9:52] fourth day which we found out for is
[9:54] god's number of deliverance there's four
[9:56] faces to the cherubims four
[9:57] four gospels four is his number of
[10:00] deliverance
[10:01] and so on the fourth day she finds
[10:02] deliverance from haman
[10:04] amen because the king came to her in her
[10:07] chamber
[10:07] to her banquet of wines to her communion
[10:09] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[10:11] so that's where we are in our story in
[10:13] esther so let's turn to esther and pick
[10:15] it up
[10:16] where we left off sunday
[10:19] we find out also that i just want to
[10:21] remind you the quote i read it sunday
[10:22] and i want to read it again out of
[10:23] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[10:25] and the reason we're diving into esther
[10:27] like we are is brother benham talking
[10:29] about
[10:30] the opening of the seven seals and he
[10:32] says it's the coming of the lord
[10:35] and and he said let me read it here out
[10:37] of christ is the mystery of god revealed
[10:40] he said god has this all to himself it's
[10:42] a secret and that's the reason there was
[10:44] silence in heaven
[10:45] for a space of half an hour and seven
[10:47] thunders uttered their voices and john
[10:48] was even forbidden to write it see the
[10:50] coming
[10:51] of the lord that's one thing he hasn't
[10:53] revealed yet of how he will come and
[10:55] when he will come it's a good thing that
[10:57] he doesn't know he has showed it or
[10:59] revealed it in every type that's in the
[11:01] bible
[11:02] amen that we find it in esther the plan
[11:04] of redemption that's the mystery of god
[11:06] the mystery redemption therefore the
[11:08] entire bible is the revelation of god's
[11:10] mystery in christ
[11:11] the entire bible is an expression of one
[11:13] goal that god had
[11:15] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[11:17] entire bible
[11:18] and all the acts of the believers in the
[11:20] bible has been in type
[11:21] in expressing what god's great goal is
[11:24] and now in this last day he has revealed
[11:26] it and
[11:27] shows it that's a marvelous quote
[11:31] that's the reason esther is coming to
[11:33] life to us
[11:34] because he he has revealed the hidden
[11:37] mystery all through the bible
[11:39] but he's only he has hid it there but
[11:41] he's only revealing it to his precious
[11:43] bride
[11:44] and he hid it there brother brenham said
[11:45] like a love letter so that at the point
[11:47] in time
[11:48] he could open our eyes to see what's
[11:50] always been there
[11:52] right it's not a new bible we're not
[11:53] rewriting the bible we're not looking
[11:55] for a new
[11:56] bible we're looking for the mystery
[11:57] that's veiled in the bible
[12:00] for the word that's already here we
[12:01] don't need to change the word what needs
[12:03] to change is our eyes
[12:05] so that we can see the word that's what
[12:07] he's doing for us
[12:08] he's continually revealing himself he
[12:10] didn't stop in 1963.
[12:12] he's continually revealing himself and
[12:14] continually revealing the love letter
[12:17] so that his children his precious bride
[12:19] would know who he is
[12:20] and so that she would know who she is
[12:23] that's what we found out
[12:24] esther first needed to realize who the
[12:27] king was but the more important was for
[12:28] esther to realize who
[12:30] she was because deliverance never came
[12:32] until esther took her place
[12:35] and deliverance in our day is not going
[12:37] to come till esther takes her place
[12:39] amen until the bride of jesus christ
[12:41] gets in her full position
[12:43] then we're not in the full redemption is
[12:45] not going to come until she gets in
[12:46] position
[12:48] whether you like it or not this whole
[12:50] thing is hinged on you and i
[12:52] yeah amen let's get in position brothers
[12:55] and sisters
[12:56] so let's go to esther eight this is
[12:58] where we ended
[12:59] so we'll pick it up here in esther
[13:01] chapter eight verse one
[13:04] said on that day and that is the fourth
[13:06] day that's the second time that the king
[13:08] has come to the banquet of wines in
[13:09] esther's house
[13:10] that's when haman is exposed to be the
[13:12] wicked one the enemy that's trying to
[13:14] take her life
[13:15] and that's where esther calls for life
[13:17] she says i want
[13:18] my life she's calling for eternal life
[13:21] and then the bride is calling saying
[13:23] my life my life is tainted my life is
[13:25] taken my life is in jeopardy why
[13:27] because of hybridization in the garden
[13:29] of eden because of serpent seed because
[13:32] of serpency because of what happened in
[13:34] the garden
[13:34] this wicked haman's plan is to destroy
[13:37] me and
[13:38] the wicked haman is the devil is the
[13:40] devil and this is when
[13:42] when is the devil exposed in the fourth
[13:45] day
[13:46] when was the devil exposed in his plan
[13:48] to destroy the people of god when was it
[13:50] exposed
[13:51] in the fourth anointing and the eagle
[13:54] anointing
[13:55] because it wasn't until brother
[13:56] branham's day that that thing was fully
[13:58] exposed the full revelation of serpent
[13:59] seed and how
[14:00] the trail of the serpent has been from
[14:02] the garden of eden all the way through
[14:04] in the antichrist spirit
[14:05] because the antichrist spirit is still
[14:06] the trail of the serpent and winds up
[14:08] all the way in the book of revelations
[14:10] amen that was revealed under the fourth
[14:13] anointing not
[14:15] not the lion anointing not the ox
[14:17] anointing not the man anointing but it
[14:19] was the eagle anointing the fourth
[14:20] anointing
[14:21] that exposed the work of haman all the
[14:23] way back in the beginning
[14:25] so deliverance comes in four
[14:29] so on that day did the king ahazeras
[14:32] give the house of haman the jew's enemy
[14:34] and to esther the queen
[14:35] so he found out all that haman thought
[14:37] that he had and all that haman thought
[14:39] was his and all that the devil thinks is
[14:40] his
[14:41] is going to become property of the bride
[14:44] it became it became esthers but then
[14:46] look what esther does
[14:50] he gave the house of haman the jewish
[14:52] enemy and to esther the queen
[14:54] and mordecai came before the king for
[14:55] esther had told what
[14:57] he was under her and the king took off
[14:59] his ring which he had taken from haman
[15:01] and he gave it unto mordecai and esther
[15:05] set mordecai over the house of haman
[15:09] this is amazing esther is taking
[15:11] authority
[15:12] esther's placing people in positions of
[15:15] authority
[15:16] and mordecai's an interesting figure so
[15:18] mordecai is a benjaminite
[15:20] and we know mordecai represents the 144
[15:22] thousand and we know the 144 000
[15:24] are attendants to the bride in the groom
[15:26] brother branham tells us that
[15:27] in the in the church ages but mordecai
[15:30] is also going to take on a
[15:31] representation of christ if we watch
[15:33] this very carefully
[15:35] mordecai is going to represent christ to
[15:37] us in this story
[15:38] especially today if you think about it
[15:42] it was mordecai who brought up esther
[15:46] it was mordecai who instructed esther
[15:48] and what she should do
[15:49] it was mordecai who told esther to go in
[15:51] before the king
[15:52] this is the work of christ as the holy
[15:54] ghost
[15:55] amen so this is what mordecai's
[15:58] representation
[15:58] we find out that esther doesn't even
[16:00] have mother or father
[16:02] who's raising her who's bringing her up
[16:04] it's mordecai
[16:06] it's the holy ghost it's not our mother
[16:08] and father but it's the holy spirit
[16:09] it's the it's the it's the office of
[16:11] christ his holy ghost who's come down
[16:13] and he's raising us up he's giving us
[16:17] instruction
[16:18] he's working all the way through to the
[16:20] house of the virgin and it says mordecai
[16:22] when she was in the house of the virgins
[16:23] came by daily to check on her
[16:27] somebody's been watching over you
[16:30] watching over you through justification
[16:33] being chosen
[16:34] watching over you through sanctification
[16:36] the 12 months in the house of the
[16:37] virgins being purged and purified
[16:39] somebody's been watching for you all the
[16:42] way until you come
[16:43] to this to this choosing of the king all
[16:46] the way through to deliverance
[16:48] amen it's this mordecai
[16:52] so mordecai gets the ceiling ring and we
[16:54] know it's the holy ghost that does the
[16:56] ceiling
[16:57] amen so let's keep moving here verse
[17:00] three
[17:01] and esther spake yet again before the
[17:03] king and fell down at his feet and
[17:04] besought him with tears
[17:06] to put away the mischief of haman the
[17:08] agagi and his device that he had devised
[17:11] against the jews
[17:12] then the king held out the golden
[17:14] scepter toward esther
[17:15] so esther arose and stood before the
[17:17] king
[17:18] and said if it pleased the king and if i
[17:20] have found favor in his sight and the
[17:22] things seem right before the king
[17:24] and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be
[17:26] written to reverse the letters
[17:28] devised by haman the son of hamadatha
[17:32] which he wrote to destroy the jews which
[17:34] are in all the king's provinces
[17:36] so we find the first time that the queen
[17:38] queen esther after she's been called
[17:40] after she's been chosen
[17:41] the first time she goes to communicate
[17:44] she certifies by
[17:45] mordecai's name to the king about the
[17:48] planned assassination
[17:51] we don't see her go in herself we don't
[17:53] see this fasting and going in and the
[17:55] scepter being extended the first time
[17:57] she certifies or sends communication in
[17:59] mordecai's name
[18:00] amen to the king but the second time
[18:03] she wants to communicate with the king
[18:05] she has to go in herself and so she's
[18:07] got this
[18:08] worry this dread this fear of going
[18:10] before the king
[18:11] and so she's got this fasting and this
[18:13] prayer and all this preparation
[18:15] and she goes in but now the third time
[18:18] after the king's been to her banquet of
[18:20] wine
[18:20] she just goes in we don't have any
[18:24] fasting any preparation or asking all
[18:26] the kindred to fast with her
[18:27] we don't have any special preparation of
[18:29] the royal garments we just see her go in
[18:32] amen her revelation is increasing as
[18:35] time goes on
[18:36] we're going to find her revelation is
[18:37] going to go even higher than that not
[18:39] that she just could go in
[18:40] and it's amazing that we find out when
[18:43] esther goes to the king
[18:44] what's what's amazing about esther going
[18:46] to the king is she goes of her
[18:48] own will not when the king
[18:52] says but when she has the desire when
[18:54] she has a need
[18:56] then she goes before the king amen and
[18:58] she finds out she's accepted to the king
[19:00] now the second time she's got a need and
[19:02] she goes before the king again
[19:03] and she's learning that she can go to
[19:04] the king
[19:06] with her needs and she finds out that
[19:08] the king loves her he's always willing
[19:10] to extend the golden scepter amen
[19:14] mercy is always extended to his bride
[19:17] so she asked that all this evil and what
[19:20] haman had done is he had written a
[19:21] decree that on an
[19:22] appointed day on the 13th day of the
[19:25] 12th month
[19:26] then everybody in all the kingdoms and
[19:27] all the 127 provinces of this king
[19:30] are going to be able to attack and kill
[19:32] the jews and spoil their goods and take
[19:33] all their stuff
[19:35] so this is a law that's on the books and
[19:37] so now after haman is destroyed he's
[19:39] hung on his own gallows
[19:41] that he had for mordecai trying to
[19:43] destroy story christ he destroys himself
[19:45] that's exactly what the devil's going to
[19:47] do amen
[19:49] and so now we find out that that
[19:53] she still has this law that she has to
[19:55] deal with
[19:58] there's still the law paul talked about
[20:01] that i find this law taking occasion
[20:03] work its destruction in my flesh
[20:06] there's still a problem there's a law on
[20:07] the books that are going to destroy her
[20:08] people
[20:09] amen so she needs not just mercy for
[20:12] herself she needs mercy for her people
[20:15] so verse 6 she says for how can i endure
[20:17] to see the evil that shall come unto my
[20:19] people
[20:20] or how can i endure to see the
[20:22] destruction of my kindred
[20:27] so first
[20:30] she goes in and she asks for her own
[20:33] life
[20:35] she goes to the king she invites the
[20:38] king into her house
[20:39] the king comes to her house she finds
[20:41] deliverance over wicked haman
[20:43] and she's asking for her life but now
[20:46] after she's found life and after she's
[20:48] found mercy
[20:49] now she goes the king to the king for
[20:52] her kindred
[20:54] she's already found pardon she's already
[20:56] found mercy she's already found life but
[20:58] now she is
[20:59] asking for life of her kindred brother
[21:01] branham says in convinced and then
[21:02] concerned
[21:03] andrew was concerned about his brother
[21:05] after he had stayed with jesus
[21:07] all night he says but i'm afraid that
[21:10] that's what's the matter with our
[21:11] churches today brother sister
[21:13] we just don't stay long enough we run in
[21:15] and shake hands with the pastor put our
[21:17] name on the book and go home
[21:19] call ourselves a church member with no
[21:20] burden for lost at all
[21:22] no burden for the lost at all we're not
[21:25] concerned about the missionary overseas
[21:26] we're not concerned about the starving
[21:28] anywhere else
[21:29] we got our tummies full and we got a
[21:31] good warm nice church and fine
[21:32] intellectual pastor that will never say
[21:35] anything against the things that we're
[21:36] doing so we're seemed to be very well
[21:38] satisfied see
[21:39] therefore we're not concerned we're not
[21:41] concerned about what goes on
[21:43] but if you was convinced that jesus
[21:45] christ raised from the dead and will
[21:46] judge you for your sins
[21:48] and that his coming is at hand and that
[21:49] his holy spirit identified himself
[21:52] then you'd be concerned about other
[21:53] people too
[21:55] and getting them to just as concerned as
[21:57] andrew was
[21:59] amen brother branham said it's a burden
[22:01] for souls once you've found your own
[22:03] pardon
[22:03] you want somebody else to find pardon
[22:05] the evidence that you found the real
[22:07] pardon is you have a desire for somebody
[22:09] else to find mercy
[22:10] you've been to the king he's been to
[22:12] your inner chamber you've found
[22:14] deliverance over wicked haman
[22:16] but it's not good enough for you to find
[22:17] eternal life now you've got a burden for
[22:20] your kindred
[22:21] amen esther's taking on the same plan
[22:24] the same path that we journey through
[22:27] so now she's crying out for her kindred
[22:30] now
[22:31] in verse 7
[22:35] then the king azeroth said unto esther
[22:37] the queen and to mordecai the jew
[22:40] now look he's speaking to both of them
[22:42] to esther the queen and mordecai the jew
[22:48] behold i have given esther the house of
[22:50] haman and him
[22:51] hath they hanged upon the gallows
[22:53] because he laid his hand upon the jews
[22:56] right ye also for the jews as it liketh
[22:58] as
[22:59] it liketh you
[23:04] the king's not telling them what to
[23:06] write
[23:08] the king is talking to esther and to
[23:10] mordecai which is a type of the holy
[23:12] spirit
[23:12] and he's talking to them and saying
[23:15] write what
[23:16] you like remember we're talking about
[23:20] the rise of the queen
[23:22] the third pool the king
[23:25] just gave esther and mordecai
[23:28] the right to write or say what they want
[23:32] to happen
[23:33] amen there's a law in the books and the
[23:36] king can't change his law
[23:37] but he's given a seal amen and by that
[23:40] seal a new word can be sealed into law
[23:43] and that would be just as effective as
[23:45] the previous law
[23:47] god's never changing his word amen he's
[23:49] never changing his word he's just giving
[23:51] us
[23:51] a seal and the seal will overcome the
[23:54] previous word
[23:55] hallelujah hallelujah
[24:00] he said the esther the queen and
[24:01] mordecai that you behold have given
[24:03] esther the house of haman and him have
[24:05] they hanged upon the gallows because he
[24:06] laid his hand upon the jews
[24:08] write ye also for the jew as it liketh
[24:11] you
[24:11] in the king's name and seal it with the
[24:13] king's ring for the writing which is
[24:15] written in the king's name and sealed
[24:17] with the king's
[24:18] ring may no man reverse
[24:21] once you've got the seal nobody's
[24:24] reversing the seal
[24:26] hallelujah amen
[24:33] i want to skip over to verse 9.
[24:37] the rest of the chapter in verse 8 is
[24:39] just what they write and mordecai goes
[24:41] to write
[24:42] how the jews are going to be able to
[24:43] defend themselves and when they're
[24:44] attacked on that day they can
[24:46] defend their enemies they can kill their
[24:47] enemies and they can take their spoil
[24:50] so everything's going to be reversed but
[24:52] now i want to pick up the story
[24:53] in chapter 9 verse 10.
[24:58] through verse 9 the day comes the
[25:00] appointed day there's an attack that the
[25:02] enemies are going to make against
[25:03] the jews the jews counter attack and
[25:05] sometimes they attack
[25:06] ahead of time and they kill all of their
[25:08] enemies so the jews now are free
[25:11] and so then they kill the ten sons in
[25:13] verse
[25:14] verse six through through nine they're
[25:17] telling the names of the ten sons of
[25:18] haman that are killed
[25:20] we'll pick it up in verse ten the ten
[25:22] sons of haman the son of hemadatha the
[25:24] enemy of the jews slew they
[25:26] but on the spoil laid they not their
[25:27] hand on that day the number of those
[25:30] that were slain in sushi and the palace
[25:32] was brought before the king
[25:34] and the king said unto esther the queen
[25:37] now i want to stop right there
[25:40] stop
[25:43] there was 500 killed they killed the 10
[25:45] sons of haman
[25:46] and then they're going to come and
[25:47] they're going to report to the king what
[25:49] had happened
[25:50] so we know that before when there was a
[25:53] when when this travesty was first set in
[25:55] motion and the decree went out that the
[25:57] jews were going to be slaughtered by the
[25:58] hand of haman
[25:59] then mordecai told esther you must
[26:02] approach to the king she says i can't
[26:04] i've not been called these 30 days but
[26:07] he says for such a time as this you were
[26:09] you were brought into power and so she
[26:11] prays she fast she goes before
[26:12] the whole scene plays out the king comes
[26:14] to her twice she goes back to the king
[26:17] amen the king allows them to say
[26:19] whatever they want to be said
[26:20] but now something has transpired
[26:22] something has changed in the
[26:23] relationship of the queen and the king
[26:26] now after the destruction amen
[26:29] and shushing of the 500 and the 10 sons
[26:31] of haman now
[26:33] they bring a report to the king that
[26:35] says thou
[26:36] this many has died and shushing and all
[26:38] this and it says the king
[26:40] says to esther where's
[26:44] esther he doesn't call for esther
[26:48] esther doesn't have to be brought before
[26:49] him esther's with him
[26:52] something has changed in the
[26:53] relationship now when they bring the
[26:55] number before
[26:57] to esther he doesn't say go fetch esther
[26:59] send a chamberlain after esther
[27:01] somebody bring esther he just tells
[27:04] esther
[27:06] look what's hidden in the love letter
[27:09] amen
[27:12] let's read it again on verse 11 on that
[27:13] day the number of those that were slain
[27:15] and shushed in the palace was brought
[27:16] before the king
[27:17] and the king said unto esther the queen
[27:21] he didn't have to go anywhere he didn't
[27:23] have to call for anybody
[27:25] he could just say to esther the kring
[27:27] why she's sitting with him
[27:29] in his throne
[27:32] look at the progression of esther
[27:36] esther progresses in a relationship with
[27:38] the king in four stages
[27:40] first she certifies to the king in
[27:43] mordecai's name
[27:44] that's how we're taught to pray jesus
[27:46] says just
[27:48] don't pray to me pray directly to the
[27:50] father in my name
[27:51] and he'll answer thee so first she
[27:53] certifies to the king in mordecai's name
[27:56] the second time she comes to the king
[27:58] herself with prayers and fastings right
[28:01] the third time
[28:03] the king comes to her banquet of wines
[28:05] in the baptism of the holy ghost
[28:08] and the fourth stage of the relationship
[28:10] is on the throne
[28:12] with the king amen
[28:17] revelations chapter 3 says to him that
[28:19] overcometh laodicea
[28:20] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[28:22] sit with me in my throne
[28:24] even as i has overcome and sit with my
[28:26] father in his throne amen
[28:30] she's got a right now to sit those that
[28:33] overcome in laodicea
[28:35] how do you overcome in laodicea by being
[28:37] born again and accepting this message
[28:39] you've overcome laodicea
[28:41] and they that overcome laodicea they've
[28:43] come out of laodicea into the bride age
[28:46] and now they have a right to sit with
[28:48] them in his
[28:49] throne hallelujah
[28:53] esther went from certifying a message in
[28:56] mordecai's name to going in
[28:58] boldly not boldly but timidly the second
[29:01] time boldly
[29:02] into the very throne room of god third
[29:04] time
[29:05] god coming into her inner chamber and
[29:07] the baptism only goes
[29:08] and the fourth time sitting with him on
[29:11] the throne
[29:13] what about your progression where are
[29:15] you in your progression
[29:17] man i don't know about you but i'm
[29:19] sitting with him on his throne
[29:21] i'm not waiting to do it later i'm doing
[29:23] it now
[29:24] amen brother branham said where is his
[29:26] throne he said his throne is in the
[29:28] hearts of men
[29:29] amen christ came to his throne and he's
[29:32] enthroned in my life
[29:34] hallelujah let's keep going
[29:41] and the king said unto esther the queen
[29:42] the jews have slain and destroyed 500
[29:44] men in shush in the palace
[29:46] and the 10 sons of haman what have they
[29:48] done in the rest of the king's provinces
[29:50] now what is thy petition and it shall be
[29:53] granted thee
[29:54] or what is thy request further and it
[29:56] shall be done
[30:00] the queen esther doesn't say anything to
[30:03] the king
[30:05] esther doesn't ask the king for anything
[30:08] now esther seated with him in his throne
[30:11] amen in his inner chamber
[30:13] and now the king is telling her this is
[30:15] what happened and this is the report
[30:17] now what is your petition what do you
[30:21] want to be
[30:22] done not what the king desires
[30:26] what do you desire to be done
[30:31] don't forget we're talking about the
[30:32] third pool
[30:34] amen we're going to get this interesting
[30:36] quotes here in just a minute
[30:41] look at what she says
[30:45] then said esther if it pleased the king
[30:49] let it be granted to the jews which are
[30:51] in shushan to do tomorrow
[30:53] as according unto this day's decree and
[30:55] let haman's ten
[30:57] sons be hanged upon the gallows and the
[31:00] king commanded it so to be done and the
[31:02] decree was given at shushan and they
[31:03] hanged
[31:04] haman's ten sons first corinthians 6 1-2
[31:08] says dare any of you having a matter
[31:09] against another go to law before the
[31:11] unjust
[31:11] and not before the saints do you not
[31:14] know that the saints shall judge the
[31:16] world
[31:18] what the king just gave to esther was
[31:19] the right to judge
[31:21] he says what would you have
[31:24] what is your petition what would you
[31:27] like to have done
[31:28] and look at what she did they had
[31:31] already killed
[31:32] the ten sons of haman
[31:35] there's a mystery laying here she had
[31:38] already they had already killed the ten
[31:40] sons of haman
[31:41] but she says let the ten sons of haman
[31:44] be hanged they're already dead
[31:49] unless now we've moved into the judgment
[31:51] the white throne judgment
[31:53] and now we're talking about the second
[31:55] death
[31:57] and who's got a right to judge at the
[31:59] white throne judgment in the second
[32:00] death
[32:01] it's the king and queen together who are
[32:03] passing judgment
[32:04] and now he looks to esther say what
[32:06] would you have to be done they're
[32:07] already dead
[32:10] they're already dead she's passing
[32:13] judgment on the dead
[32:15] it's the white throne judgment esther's
[32:17] now passing judgment on that which is
[32:19] already dead
[32:20] and she says hang them it's the second
[32:23] death
[32:24] and who gets a right to say past
[32:26] judgment the queen
[32:28] esther that's you and i we're not going
[32:31] to be in the judgment
[32:33] we're going to be on the throne judging
[32:35] with him
[32:37] it's an esther it's right here
[32:42] praise god i like it
[32:49] it's amazing i want to back up and just
[32:50] remind you mordecai
[32:52] is a type of christ
[32:55] and in this story we're at the we're at
[32:58] the wrapping up of all time the exposing
[33:00] of haman the destruction of the enemies
[33:02] of the
[33:03] of god's chosen people and their freedom
[33:05] to go free and what we have is
[33:07] is we have mordechai the benjaminite
[33:11] jesus christ came out of the tribe of
[33:13] judah the alpha but the omega is
[33:15] benjamin
[33:16] the first tribe is reuben the last tribe
[33:18] is benjamin
[33:19] so he's showing at the final stage at
[33:21] the very last the little benjamin
[33:23] is when mordecai comes on the scene and
[33:25] leads esther all the way into the throne
[33:27] room of god
[33:28] amen and we'll find his role here at the
[33:30] very end
[33:33] brother branham says now i want to talk
[33:36] about this third pool because we see it
[33:38] in esther
[33:38] the third pool is when the king says
[33:41] what would you have
[33:43] the third pulls when the king says you
[33:45] say brother ram is going to talk about
[33:47] this in the message testimony in 1963
[33:50] said i was praying i heard something say
[33:52] stand up on your feet
[33:53] now he's praying for his wife his wife
[33:55] has a tumor and he's prayed for he's
[33:56] laid hands on her and her tumor keeps
[33:58] growing
[33:59] and growing and growing we're very
[34:01] familiar with the story
[34:03] she's down in tucson she's going to go
[34:04] see a specialist he's in jeffersonville
[34:07] he's getting prepared for some meetings
[34:08] and he's praying
[34:10] and while he's praying something says
[34:11] stand up on your feet and i just went
[34:13] ahead praying because i thought maybe i
[34:15] imagined that
[34:17] he was a human being amen he was a man
[34:21] i just imagined that and as i was
[34:22] praying on something said stand up on
[34:24] your feet
[34:25] i thought what was that stand up on your
[34:27] feet i thought well
[34:28] i'll stand up on my feet
[34:31] and i got up on my feet just that same
[34:34] voice that spoke up here on the hill
[34:36] that night
[34:37] the same one who always come i said lord
[34:39] god what
[34:40] was that that you spoke to your servant
[34:43] he said
[34:44] just say the word and there'll be no
[34:45] more tumor
[34:48] the king is telling esther say what you
[34:51] want
[34:53] what would you want to happen next
[34:55] that's what's happening here in this
[34:56] story
[34:59] i stood there a little bit i got to
[35:01] myself i got
[35:02] to get to myself right many of you knows
[35:04] in here and the people in the tabernacle
[35:06] knows what
[35:07] was that she had it i said then i say in
[35:09] the name of the lord jesus christ that
[35:11] that tumor shall leave her
[35:13] been bothering her so bad she had been
[35:15] in bed for three or four days with it
[35:17] i said they will never even find a trace
[35:19] of it for the lord my god who is creator
[35:21] who can stop winds and storms and can
[35:23] rebuke the seas and bring forth that
[35:25] he is the creator of heavens and earth
[35:27] and i love him and believe him and i
[35:28] believe that this time
[35:30] that this time is now nearing when these
[35:32] things are to be
[35:33] and you who would create a squirrel and
[35:35] put it into existence can take an enemy
[35:37] out of existence hallelujah
[35:41] we know the prophet said before they lay
[35:43] a hand on her it'll be gone and that's
[35:44] exactly
[35:45] to the t how it happened she laid on the
[35:48] examination table the doctor when he
[35:49] moved towards her to put his hand on her
[35:51] to check the tumor
[35:52] she felt something cool sweep over her
[35:53] and it was gone
[35:56] he wasn't he was praying but it wasn't
[35:59] prayer that moved the tumor
[36:01] he had prayed for her before but this
[36:04] time it was different it wasn't a prayer
[36:06] of faith
[36:06] it wasn't a prayer according to the
[36:08] faith in the word that moved that
[36:09] turmeric
[36:10] it was when the king said to the queen
[36:12] when the king said to esther
[36:14] what do you want you say what you
[36:17] want and it'll be done and guess what
[36:20] when esther said what she wanted done
[36:22] guess what was done
[36:24] whatsoever esther said and when the king
[36:26] came to the prophet this way and
[36:28] said you speak whatever he said was
[36:31] exactly what happened
[36:33] again
[36:36] brother braham says in the message i
[36:38] have heard but now i see in 1965
[36:41] joshua was in an hour of crisis when the
[36:43] armies were routed and the sun was going
[36:45] down
[36:46] joshua was a prophet and he knew that if
[36:47] them armies ever had a chance to unite
[36:49] again
[36:50] and come against them he would lose more
[36:51] men so in the hour of crisis when
[36:53] something had to be done
[36:55] there's only one thing if he could keep
[36:56] them running he'd route them everyone
[36:58] down
[36:59] but there wasn't enough light to do it
[37:00] so joshua stood raised his hands and
[37:02] said son stand still
[37:04] and moon hang over agile until i get
[37:06] through with this battle
[37:08] and the sun stood still they heard
[37:09] joshua speak and then they seen god
[37:12] with their own eyes in action true
[37:15] that's what he says perhaps joshua never
[37:19] had tried to figure out how he was going
[37:21] to do it how god was going to do it the
[37:23] only thing that he said was son stand
[37:24] still
[37:25] he said it perhaps not knowing what he
[37:27] was saying because it was god that gave
[37:29] it to him
[37:30] and he worked same thing in mark 11 23
[37:33] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[37:35] don't doubt in your heart
[37:36] but believe that what you said will come
[37:38] to pass you can have what you said
[37:40] but you can't stand there fumble in your
[37:42] mind and say you've got
[37:44] is to say it you've got to be inspired
[37:47] to say it
[37:48] amen brother is going to make this
[37:50] really clear this
[37:51] isn't you taking the word upon yourself
[37:54] of your own will and speaking it
[37:55] it's by permission he's going to make
[37:59] that really clear
[38:01] excuse the expression but that day
[38:02] sitting there in the woods and god's my
[38:04] judge and i could fall dead on this
[38:06] pulpit
[38:06] when that scripture had stumped me all
[38:08] my life what scripture
[38:10] saying to this mountain that's the
[38:11] scripture he says it stumped me
[38:13] all my life sitting there that morning
[38:16] in the woods
[38:17] and i was thinking on that and that
[38:18] voice spoke to me and said that
[38:20] scripture is like all scripture it's
[38:22] true
[38:23] and i thought well how could it be and
[38:26] he said
[38:27] he said speak and it will be that way
[38:30] don't doubt it
[38:31] and i was talking to somebody sitting
[38:33] way out in the woods no squirrel's been
[38:34] there for three days
[38:36] there's no squirrels there and i was
[38:37] sitting in a sycamore thicket
[38:39] squirrels don't even come anybody that
[38:41] hunt squirrels know they're not in
[38:42] sycamore
[38:43] and i had been sitting there and the
[38:44] wind blowing real hard about 10 o'clock
[38:46] in the morning and i was thinking again
[38:48] and it said you're hunting and you need
[38:50] squirrels just
[38:52] just the same as abraham needed a ram
[38:56] i thought that's always told me the
[38:58] truth but this sounds funny
[39:00] and i got up from where i was sitting
[39:01] and i looked around where is that person
[39:03] that was talking to me
[39:06] nothing wind just blowing real hard and
[39:08] i thought could i have fell asleep and
[39:10] dreamed that
[39:11] no i wasn't asleep i was sitting up
[39:12] against the tree there watching
[39:14] supposed to pick up brother woods and
[39:16] brother sophomore back there just in a
[39:17] little bit
[39:18] around 10 o'clock in the morning farmers
[39:20] all around there working gathering their
[39:22] corn
[39:23] and i heard it again say you're hunting
[39:25] and you need game
[39:26] how many do you need
[39:30] and i thought now i don't want to overdo
[39:32] this
[39:34] i'm just going to ask for three
[39:35] squirrels three squirrels
[39:37] i want young three red squirrels i want
[39:40] them he said
[39:41] listen brother branham says and i
[39:44] thought
[39:45] get this and i thought now i don't want
[39:48] to overdo it i'll just ask for three i
[39:50] want three red squirrels
[39:51] and then he said then speak about it
[39:56] thinking wasn't good enough
[39:59] didn't matter what esther was thinking
[40:01] when the king spoke to her it mattered
[40:03] what she said
[40:06] amen then speak about it and i said i'm
[40:08] going to get three young red squirrels
[40:11] and he said which away will they come
[40:14] well i thought i've went this far
[40:16] there's something talking to me here
[40:17] just as the same as you hear me talking
[40:19] and god in heaven with this bible over
[40:21] my heart knows that's the truth
[40:23] and i said well i picked out a
[40:24] ridiculous place an old dry limb hanging
[40:27] out of there
[40:27] about 50 yards where my rifle was shot
[40:29] in i said the first one will be right
[40:31] there
[40:32] and there he was i rubbed my eyes and
[40:34] looked back i turned my head and i
[40:35] thought i don't want to shoot a vision
[40:37] so i looked around again and there set
[40:39] the squirrel i throwed a shell up in my
[40:40] gun and aimed up and i could see his
[40:42] black eye
[40:43] young red squirrel i thought maybe i'm
[40:45] sleeping i'll wake up in a few minutes
[40:47] see i'm dreaming about this
[40:48] while i leveled down shot the squirrel
[40:50] and it dropped off the limb i thought
[40:52] well
[40:52] i don't know i thought well should i go
[40:54] over and look for it
[40:55] and i walked over there and there it
[40:57] laid i picked it up and blood run out of
[41:00] it
[41:00] a vision don't bleed you know so i
[41:02] picked it up and it was a squirrel
[41:04] i got real numb all over and i looked
[41:07] around i said god that was you i said
[41:09] thank you for this
[41:10] now i'll go out and and he said but you
[41:13] said
[41:13] do you doubt what you said you
[41:16] said you'd get three now where will the
[41:19] next one
[41:20] come from why because there was a king
[41:24] who could call to a man on earth
[41:25] and say what do you want
[41:29] now catch this brother branham wasn't
[41:32] praying
[41:35] he wasn't praying he was just living
[41:38] life
[41:39] not praying but while he was living life
[41:42] god spoke to him and said now you say
[41:46] brother brethren was pondering on this
[41:47] scripture he's thinking about this has
[41:49] always baffled me all of my life to
[41:51] say to this mountain but here god comes
[41:53] and vindicates that that scripture is
[41:55] the truth
[41:58] amen i want to read
[42:02] i want to read another quote to you
[42:03] where brother branham makes this really
[42:04] clear
[42:07] in questions and answers somebody asked
[42:08] him this question
[42:11] said this third pool end is speaking the
[42:13] word
[42:14] it seems entirely possible for you to
[42:16] speak the word and one would be
[42:18] completely and fully restored
[42:20] placed entirely ready for the rapture in
[42:21] the resurrection the son of man
[42:24] this is so or is it not and you would do
[42:26] this if properly pressed upon would you
[42:28] not
[42:29] escape would you not escape all things
[42:32] escape all things and stand before the
[42:34] son of man so somebody's asking brother
[42:36] branham a question in 1964 they've heard
[42:38] his stories about the spoken word
[42:40] speaking squirrels into existence and
[42:42] the hattie wright and these other things
[42:44] and now they're asking couldn't you just
[42:46] speak to somebody
[42:47] and they'll be fully restored and
[42:48] rapture ready
[42:52] listen to his response he said now
[42:55] my dear friend see now i think you've
[42:57] got a good statement
[42:58] yes sir yes sir now that would be so
[43:01] now that would be so brother branham
[43:03] saying he could do that
[43:06] he could speak to somebody and they
[43:08] would be raps restored and rapture ready
[43:11] he said yes sir that would be so
[43:14] now look what else he says
[43:18] you said brother branham in other words
[43:20] not to polish up what you said but i
[43:21] believe i can make it a little clearer
[43:23] to people
[43:24] see you are believing because of the
[43:26] spoken words and things like that
[43:28] that he said about and all of you here
[43:30] witnessed the squirrels and all these
[43:32] other things that's been done
[43:33] but did you notice that was sovereignly
[43:36] given here's the key that unlocks this
[43:40] mystery
[43:41] it was sovereignly given
[43:46] i never asked him lord let me do this
[43:49] speak these things like that
[43:50] do these things there i never asked him
[43:52] that he by his own
[43:54] divine will came to me and said you go
[43:56] do this
[43:58] see i wasn't asking one thing about it
[44:00] moses never asked to go down in egypt
[44:02] but it was god that sent him down to
[44:03] egypt sea
[44:04] now i believe that the holy spirit would
[44:06] come to me and say in a vision
[44:08] go tell a certain certain person that
[44:09] they're not they're trying to overcome a
[44:11] certain thing and they cannot do it
[44:13] and they're smoking they're drinking
[44:14] they're lying stealing or committing
[44:15] adultery whatever it might be
[44:17] or they got lustful spirit and you just
[44:19] go where they are and say
[44:20] thou spirit come out of there and set
[44:22] this captive free
[44:23] would it take place absolutely yes
[44:26] indeed it absolutely would
[44:27] it'd take place but now upon my own
[44:30] presuming
[44:32] now presume means to venture without
[44:34] authority see i'd go down there to help
[44:37] this person i'm just presuming that
[44:39] it'll be all right see
[44:40] then i don't know i can call the name of
[44:42] the lord over them and i can pray for
[44:44] them
[44:44] or do whatever i wish to do. he's saying
[44:47] i could go
[44:47] pray for a person in that condition but
[44:50] i can't declare them whole
[44:54] that's just presuming brother branham
[44:57] says
[44:58] he says could you call for somebody
[44:59] they'd be restored and raptured yes sir
[45:01] absolutely
[45:02] absolutely but the key that unlocks the
[45:05] mystery is it's sovereignly given
[45:07] you can't just decide to do that you
[45:10] can't choose to operate the third pool
[45:13] we've had so much fanaticism so much
[45:15] crazy stuff take racing the message
[45:17] because
[45:18] people want to claim things that they
[45:19] have no right to claim
[45:21] you don't have a right to claim things
[45:22] and say this is the way it's going to be
[45:24] and you're going to be delivered because
[45:26] brother branham said you can have faith
[45:28] in the word and you can teach and preach
[45:30] the word of god
[45:31] but you do you to declare that a demons
[45:33] come out of a person brother branham
[45:35] said
[45:35] they can come across the pulpit he
[45:37] himself can pour gallons of oil over
[45:39] them and anoint them and lay hands on
[45:40] them and he said if they have
[45:42] unconfessed sin that devil will never go
[45:44] anywhere
[45:45] he's got a right to stay and so you by
[45:48] claiming
[45:48] you're going to go free you're going to
[45:50] be healed everything's all right you're
[45:52] just presuming because you don't know
[45:55] you know the word says by faith they can
[45:57] go free
[45:58] you can say what the word says and if
[46:00] you believe the word you'll go free
[46:02] but you can't claim something you have
[46:04] no right to claim
[46:06] all right this kind of preaching makes
[46:08] some people nervous because they want to
[46:09] claim some stuff
[46:10] they want to say everything's going to
[46:11] be this and everything's going to be
[46:12] that everything's going to be according
[46:14] to the word and it operates by faith and
[46:15] faith is grace a gift that's given to
[46:17] you to believe
[46:19] but you must believe and you can't
[46:20] believe without grace and faith is a
[46:22] revelation it's revealed to you that the
[46:24] word works
[46:25] not because somebody looked down at you
[46:27] and said the word says this i
[46:28] proclaim you to be healed and delivered
[46:30] that's presuming
[46:34] unless you see a vision or unless god
[46:36] speaks to you
[46:38] you can't go and do those things that
[46:40] creates
[46:41] catastrophe every time because it
[46:44] doesn't work 100
[46:46] amen now we're not saying
[46:49] don't claim the word claim the word but
[46:51] it operates by
[46:52] faith not by somebody saying it's
[46:55] working
[46:56] but by the person who actually takes the
[46:58] word and believes it
[46:59] by grace by a gift of god they have the
[47:02] faith to believe
[47:03] and when they believe the word goes into
[47:04] action
[47:06] amen esther never said the way it was
[47:10] going to be until the king told her to
[47:11] say the way it was going to be
[47:13] esther didn't go in making a bunch of
[47:15] claims and esther didn't go on
[47:16] saying well haman's going to this and
[47:18] haman's going to that esther went in
[47:19] humbly before the king
[47:21] making her request but when the king
[47:22] said you say then she had a right to say
[47:26] but not until the king said you say
[47:30] amen i hope this clears up a whole bunch
[47:33] of confusion
[47:35] because people have taken the gift of
[47:36] god and made it disgraceful
[47:39] by assuming a bunch of stuff
[47:42] here's what brother brahma goes on to
[47:43] say it's wonderful what he says
[47:46] now if i had my own way this morning
[47:49] i had an interview with this little lady
[47:51] sitting here this wheelchair
[47:53] to come to this meeting today they had
[47:54] to have the fire department to take her
[47:56] out of her house in chicago
[47:57] and there's people that live across the
[47:58] street and don't come to the meeting see
[48:01] what would i do if it was in my power
[48:04] see i have the authority to do it
[48:07] amen i have the authority to do it but i
[48:10] have to wait for orders
[48:12] to do it did the apostle paul have the
[48:15] power to cast out the demon spirit
[48:17] of the woman who followed him for three
[48:18] days crying out he had the power but he
[48:21] had to wait for divine permission
[48:23] to use the authority that was in him
[48:26] amen
[48:26] he had the authority to do it he could
[48:29] do it he proved that he could do it
[48:30] and on the third day he did it but why
[48:32] didn't he do it on day one day two why
[48:34] did he wait till after the third day
[48:36] because he didn't have permission yet
[48:39] jesus didn't he go forth doing anything
[48:41] he wanted to do he said i only do that
[48:43] which the father shows me
[48:45] amen this authority comes under the
[48:48] restraint of the divine will of god
[48:50] and that's what the bride has to mature
[48:52] into into the place
[48:54] where god can speak and she'll move into
[48:55] action but not her will not her desire
[48:58] not her thinking
[48:59] not one ounce of presuming but by faith
[49:01] she's got faith in the word of god
[49:03] or she keeps still she has thus saith
[49:05] the lord or she keeps still
[49:08] hallelujah what we're wanting is
[49:10] something that's real
[49:12] we don't want to pretend we don't want
[49:13] to put on we don't want something that
[49:15] happens sometimes and doesn't happen the
[49:17] other time
[49:17] what we're waiting on before the lord is
[49:19] faith in his word to rise to a place
[49:21] that we've got the genuine article
[49:23] the real deal the genuine tongues the
[49:26] genuine interpretation of drunks the
[49:28] genuine laying hands of the sick the
[49:30] real genuine thing
[49:32] amen amen the only thing we do by
[49:36] presuming has hurt a lot of people
[49:41] he says i have the authority to do it
[49:42] but i have to wait for orders to do it
[49:44] see
[49:45] i have the authority from god to do it
[49:47] but now when he gives the order
[49:48] she'd go back home well see i know that
[49:51] is the truth
[49:52] i'd be i'd just be as willing to die
[49:54] this morning on that
[49:56] as i'd be on anything see that's the
[49:58] truth
[49:59] what's the truth when i get the orders
[50:01] he said she would go home well
[50:02] i would just be just as willing to die
[50:04] on that as anything this morning
[50:06] because he knows once god said it
[50:08] there's nothing that could stop it from
[50:09] happening
[50:10] but unless god spoken it to you or give
[50:12] you into a real genuine revelation you
[50:14] don't have the right to speak it
[50:16] you have the right to speak the word and
[50:18] faith
[50:19] and say lord according to your word i
[50:21] believe that this will happen
[50:22] but you don't have the right to go
[50:23] around saying this is going to be that
[50:25] and this is going to be that
[50:26] and you're going to be this you've got
[50:28] to be careful with that
[50:30] brother branham said if you ever do that
[50:31] it doesn't come to pass you better come
[50:33] down to the altar and have hands laid on
[50:34] you and ask for that demon to be cast
[50:36] out of you
[50:36] because the spirit of god is never wrong
[50:40] man a lot of people should have done
[50:42] that a long time ago they would have
[50:44] saved a lot of people a lot of heartache
[50:45] and grief
[50:47] amen
[50:53] now let's get back to esther coming into
[50:55] position in the third pool
[50:59] brother branham says in pergamon church
[51:01] age in the church age book
[51:02] those in the bride do only his will no
[51:05] one can make them do otherwise
[51:06] they have thus saith the lord or they
[51:08] keep still they know that it has to be
[51:10] god
[51:11] in them doing the works fulfilling his
[51:12] own word he did not complete all his
[51:14] work while in his earthly ministry
[51:16] so now he works in and through the bride
[51:22] she knows that for was not yet time for
[51:24] him to do certain things that he must
[51:26] now do but he will now fulfill through
[51:30] the bride
[51:31] that work which he left for this
[51:33] specific
[51:34] time does christ still have a work to do
[51:37] on the earth
[51:38] absolutely how's he going to do it
[51:40] through his body
[51:41] who's his body the ones who are baptized
[51:44] into one body by one spirit
[51:46] is the literal body of jesus christ and
[51:48] if he's got a work to do on the earth
[51:50] he's got to use his earthly body
[51:52] that's you and i brothers and sisters
[51:54] we're his hands we're his feet we're his
[51:56] eyes we're his mouth we're his ears
[51:58] and if he's got a work to do there's
[51:59] only one way he can do it in the earth
[52:01] is when he uses his body
[52:03] hallelujah so there's still something
[52:05] for us to do
[52:13] esther chapter 9 verse 29.
[52:24] then esther the queen the daughter of
[52:26] abigail and mordecai the jew
[52:28] wrote with all authority to confirm this
[52:30] second letter of purim
[52:32] and he sent the letters into all the
[52:33] jews to the 120 and seven provinces of
[52:36] king
[52:37] of king of the kingdom of ahazaris with
[52:39] the words of peace and truth
[52:40] to confirm these days of purim and their
[52:42] times appointed according
[52:44] as mordecai the jew and esther the queen
[52:46] had enjoined them
[52:47] and as they had decreed for themselves
[52:49] and for their seed
[52:50] the matters of the fasting in their cry
[52:52] now look in verse 29 it says then esther
[52:54] the queen
[52:55] the daughter of i behale and mordecai
[52:57] the jew wrote with all authority
[52:59] and then in 31 it says according as
[53:02] mordecai the jew
[53:03] and esther the queen had enjoined them
[53:06] i think it's very unusual and it's very
[53:08] odd the way the scripture
[53:09] speaks whenever whenever esther is going
[53:12] to decree or esther's going to move
[53:14] go into motion to write something or say
[53:16] something it's esther
[53:18] and mordecai have we seen that nestor
[53:21] esther and mordecai mordecai is a type
[53:24] of rod the spirit of god
[53:26] and so we have this scripture in
[53:28] revelations
[53:31] right at the end of the book revelations
[53:34] 22.
[53:36] i'll just turn to it i can't find it in
[53:37] my notes
[53:45] revelation 22 17 and the spirit
[53:49] and the bride say come
[53:53] in esther and mordecai wrote
[53:56] and astor and mordecai decreed amen
[54:00] do we see it in the spirit in the bride
[54:04] say come and at the end time in this
[54:07] last stage
[54:08] what's the voice that's speaking it's
[54:09] the spirit speaking through the bride
[54:12] amen because the spirit can't speak in
[54:14] an audible voice that others can hear
[54:16] unless he uses your vocal cords and the
[54:19] spirit and the bride
[54:20] say come in the end time
[54:25] it's going to be the spirit and the
[54:27] bride
[54:29] amen i want to finish up here
[54:33] with with esther now esther has the
[54:36] authority because she's the queen
[54:38] because the king's given her the
[54:40] authority but mordecai
[54:42] has the power to enforce the authority
[54:45] amen you get it the spirit and the bride
[54:48] say come
[54:49] the the bride of atazeras by his
[54:52] authority by his will by his decree
[54:54] has given esther the right to say what
[54:56] she wants to write what she wants
[54:58] to make law what she wants to make law
[55:00] so she has the authority to say it
[55:02] but mordecai the holy spirit has the
[55:05] seal
[55:06] or the power to put it in action
[55:09] hallelujah that's why it's the spirit
[55:12] and the bride that say come
[55:13] because the bride has the authority on
[55:15] earth for these things but it's the
[55:17] spirit of god that comes and backs up
[55:18] what she says and is the power to
[55:20] manifest what she says
[55:23] amen that's why it's always esther and
[55:26] mordecai
[55:32] let's look at esther 9 32
[55:37] and the decree of esther confirmed these
[55:40] matters of purim
[55:41] and it was written in the book
[55:46] it wasn't that the king said it should
[55:47] be in the book it wasn't that the king
[55:50] decreed
[55:50] the king is not decreeing
[55:53] amen after haman's exposed and delivered
[55:56] after the second coming of the king
[55:58] it's the king is always telling esther
[56:00] to say what she wants
[56:01] then it's esther and mordecai working
[56:02] together over here in esther and
[56:04] mordecai working together over here but
[56:06] at the end
[56:07] the decree of esther
[56:11] confirmed the matters of purim amen
[56:15] and it was written in the book
[56:18] he has things yet that he needs to do on
[56:20] the earth and he's going to do it
[56:22] in and through the bride
[56:25] who do you think is going to be
[56:26] decreeing in the last days whose voice
[56:28] is it that says come
[56:30] the spirit and the bride not of her own
[56:33] will
[56:34] not of our own choosing but by divine
[56:36] commandment of the father
[56:40] just a couple more quotes we'll wrap up
[56:42] this will finish our topic here
[56:45] is the rising of the sun 1965 as christ
[56:49] was the first one to rise from all the
[56:50] prophets and so forth
[56:52] although typed in many places he was the
[56:54] first fruits of those that slept
[56:56] in the bride coming of christ did you
[56:58] catch that
[57:00] the second coming of christ is what the
[57:02] bride coming of christ
[57:05] remember he comes in mail then he comes
[57:07] in female
[57:08] then the third time is male and female
[57:10] restored to eden
[57:12] all right he came as male and jesus
[57:13] christ the men that walked
[57:15] in nazareth the man from nazareth walks
[57:17] by the sea of galilee
[57:18] the second time he comes into a many
[57:20] member bride amen
[57:22] so now we're talking about the second
[57:23] coming in the bride coming of christ
[57:26] out of the church they'll have to be a
[57:27] sheaf waved again in the last days oh my
[57:30] waving of the sheaf what was the sheave
[57:32] the first one that come to mature the
[57:34] first one that proved
[57:36] it was wheat that proved it was a sheep
[57:38] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[57:39] talking
[57:40] about it was waved over the people and
[57:41] the first time there will come
[57:43] forth for the bright age for a
[57:44] resurrection out of dark
[57:46] denominationalism
[57:47] have we received the resurrection out of
[57:49] dark denominationalism
[57:50] how many has received that resurrection
[57:52] already amen
[57:54] i'm just waiting for my body to catch up
[57:55] to where my soul is
[57:58] but i've already received that
[57:58] resurrection out of dark
[58:00] denominationalism
[58:01] will be a message that the full maturity
[58:03] of the word has turned back again in its
[58:05] full power
[58:06] and being waved over the people by the
[58:08] same signs and wonders that he did back
[58:10] there
[58:12] so brother branham talking about the
[58:13] wave chief offering he talks about jesus
[58:15] christ
[58:16] he was the wave chief offering he come
[58:17] and he proved amen he proved
[58:19] he fulfilled all the law and he proved
[58:21] that all the works were available to the
[58:23] people
[58:24] and he was the wave chief waved over the
[58:26] people in resurrection when he
[58:28] resurrected he proved that he overcome
[58:30] death
[58:30] and all the promises were coming to the
[58:31] people and the book of the acts was the
[58:33] rest of the harvest
[58:35] we got it so the resurrection of christ
[58:37] was the wave chief offering waved over
[58:39] the people
[58:39] and the book of acts is the rest of the
[58:41] of the harvest
[58:42] now he says in the second coming of
[58:44] christ amen in the bride coming of
[58:47] christ
[58:47] there will once again need to be a wave
[58:49] sheath offered over the congregation
[58:51] and the wave sheep was the first part of
[58:54] the field to come to harvest maturity
[58:56] was cut and waved before the lord and
[58:58] that's his ministry
[59:00] mother brennan's ministry is the wave
[59:01] sheep offering but just as jesus christ
[59:04] was the wave sheep offering there had to
[59:05] be a full harvest come
[59:07] and the full harvest was the book of
[59:08] acts
[59:10] now in the bride coming of christ there
[59:12] has to be a wave sheep offering proving
[59:14] that the full maturity of the word was
[59:16] back again
[59:17] and then brother branham show us that
[59:18] the full maturity of the word was back
[59:20] again
[59:21] so just like the wave chief has offered
[59:24] there's got to be a full harvest
[59:29] was it all in the prophet no he was the
[59:32] first
[59:32] one the wave chief the first one to come
[59:36] to full harvest maturity the full word
[59:38] back again
[59:38] but there's got to be a full harvest the
[59:41] whole field's got to come to full word
[59:42] maturity
[59:43] amen to everything that's in the word is
[59:46] in the
[59:47] is in the field every gift that's in the
[59:50] body has to be in the field
[59:52] it can't just be in the wave sheath it's
[59:54] got to come to the body to full harvest
[59:56] maturity
[59:57] and in the last days we've had the wave
[59:59] chief and the way she proved that this
[1:00:01] word will bring a harvest to full
[1:00:02] maturity
[1:00:04] and so now we've been laying in the
[1:00:06] presence of the sun which is the same
[1:00:07] word
[1:00:08] and that same word is bringing the rest
[1:00:10] of the field to full harvest maturity
[1:00:12] but there's got to be another book of
[1:00:14] acts written behind it
[1:00:15] the first wave she produced the book of
[1:00:17] acts the second wave chief has to
[1:00:19] produce a book of acts
[1:00:21] but not a presuming not a hoping so but
[1:00:24] the real genuine thing
[1:00:26] amen we see it all around us it's
[1:00:29] happening all the time we hear
[1:00:30] testimonies after testimonies after
[1:00:32] testimonies
[1:00:32] but that's got to come to full harvest
[1:00:34] maturity
[1:00:36] amen but we don't want to put on
[1:00:43] look what brother branham says in
[1:00:44] looking away to jesus in
[1:00:46] 1963 the very end december 29th 1963.
[1:00:52] so now i'm going to say something to you
[1:00:53] now that i haven't said all along
[1:00:56] and that is that the thing we have
[1:00:57] looked forward to so long for at least
[1:00:59] many years four or five years or maybe
[1:01:01] longer
[1:01:01] the third pull has now been vindicated
[1:01:04] and i'm sure you all know what it is now
[1:01:08] brother branham
[1:01:08] told us that the third pool and anointed
[1:01:10] ones at the end time he says the third
[1:01:12] pool is the opening of the word
[1:01:15] all right when he's talking about third
[1:01:17] pool he goes back to a vision he had in
[1:01:19] 1956
[1:01:20] and in this vision in 1956 he starts off
[1:01:24] by he's trying to i believe he starts
[1:01:27] off by trying to thread
[1:01:29] a cord into a baby shoe and he's got a
[1:01:31] great big cord and a little bitty eyelid
[1:01:33] on the shoe and he can't get it to go in
[1:01:35] and the angel of the lord tells him you
[1:01:37] can't teach pentecostal babies spiritual
[1:01:39] things
[1:01:40] all right so then after that goes away
[1:01:43] there's a fishing pole in his hand
[1:01:45] and he's fishing on the bank and there's
[1:01:46] other fishermen around and we find out
[1:01:48] that they're all ministers
[1:01:49] and the end of the lord tells him to go
[1:01:50] out deep and catch the big ones
[1:01:52] said all around here are little ones but
[1:01:53] out there is the big rainbow trout
[1:01:55] that's what you're after
[1:01:56] so he puts the lure on and he casts it
[1:01:58] out then all the ministers come around
[1:01:59] and says
[1:02:00] you're a fisherman aren't you you're a
[1:02:01] fisherman how do you do it and he said
[1:02:03] that made me feel pretty good
[1:02:05] and i said yeah i'm a fisherman so i
[1:02:07] begin to show them what i'm doing and i
[1:02:09] do this first pull this first little
[1:02:10] jerk of the lure
[1:02:11] to try to attract the tension of the
[1:02:13] fish and he says that's the sign in the
[1:02:14] hand when i lay my hand on him and the
[1:02:16] bumps and things and the red
[1:02:18] rash would appear and i would tell them
[1:02:19] what disease they had that's the first
[1:02:21] little jerk trying to catch those big
[1:02:23] fish
[1:02:24] what's he trying to catch rainbow trout
[1:02:27] he said covenant fish
[1:02:30] seed of god and he says then another
[1:02:33] little fish come
[1:02:34] and on the second pool the second pull
[1:02:36] which is discernment of the thoughts and
[1:02:38] intents of the heart
[1:02:39] when god would tell him people's sins
[1:02:40] and what they had done and look back and
[1:02:42] show him by vision their doctor and
[1:02:43] what's wrong with them and
[1:02:45] and all of that he said i jerked it real
[1:02:47] hard and jerked the lure clear out of
[1:02:48] the water and on it was this little
[1:02:50] bitty old fish
[1:02:51] looked like skin over allure i don't
[1:02:53] even know how it swallowed the thing
[1:02:55] now he's trying to catch rainbow trout
[1:02:57] but what's he catching little bitty old
[1:02:59] fish
[1:03:01] he says just like them other brethren
[1:03:04] were catching
[1:03:05] the second pool was only catching the
[1:03:07] same kind of crop
[1:03:08] that all the other ministries and
[1:03:10] evangelistic ministries on the field was
[1:03:11] catching
[1:03:13] but he was supposed to catch rainbow
[1:03:15] trout
[1:03:17] covenant fish and none of these brethren
[1:03:19] were catching the covenant fish
[1:03:21] he said they were out in the deep waters
[1:03:24] hallelujah it's going to take more than
[1:03:26] a little shallow water experience
[1:03:28] for the fish to live in so the second
[1:03:31] pool was the
[1:03:31] was the discernment or the prophesying
[1:03:33] but he said the third pool was the
[1:03:35] opening of the word
[1:03:36] and it's the third pool that catches the
[1:03:38] rainbow trout
[1:03:39] amen not the signs and wonders not the
[1:03:42] prophecies that just draws their
[1:03:43] attention he says that's the lure
[1:03:45] that's the bait on the hook but the hook
[1:03:47] is the word
[1:03:48] amen and so he was showing that it's not
[1:03:50] the first pool or the second bull and he
[1:03:52] says you made a great mistake in trying
[1:03:54] to explain
[1:03:55] how you were trying to catch the fish
[1:03:58] trying to explain the gift and
[1:03:59] and he was always trying to explain how
[1:04:02] the supernatural worked and he never
[1:04:04] could anyways nobody ever understood it
[1:04:05] but he said this will create a bunch of
[1:04:07] impersonations
[1:04:08] and it did so he said
[1:04:12] now in this third pool this third pool
[1:04:14] is the opening
[1:04:15] of the word it was the opening of the
[1:04:17] seven seals
[1:04:19] all right and what was that when amen
[1:04:22] when the book of redemption was opened
[1:04:23] in the
[1:04:24] in the children of god the rainbow trout
[1:04:26] saw all the redemptive promises coming
[1:04:28] back and they saw their name in the book
[1:04:30] and they saw the title deed back in the
[1:04:32] hand of of the lamb
[1:04:34] then they realized that i'm part of that
[1:04:36] book and that is what was catching the
[1:04:37] fish
[1:04:38] what's catching the rainbow trout today
[1:04:40] not brother branham's discernment amen
[1:04:42] not the bumps that he had on his hand
[1:04:44] but it's the word and it's the word
[1:04:46] that's catching the fish
[1:04:48] you might be able to attract a rainbow
[1:04:50] trout with the first pole or the second
[1:04:52] pull of the
[1:04:52] lure but what's going to hook him and
[1:04:54] what's going to catch him is the opening
[1:04:55] of the word that's the third pull
[1:04:58] but then what brother branham is talking
[1:04:59] about now is he's talking about
[1:05:02] the the vindication of the third pool
[1:05:05] all right the third pulls the opening of
[1:05:08] the word but the
[1:05:09] evidence of the third pull is the spoken
[1:05:11] word
[1:05:13] all right brother branham when he talks
[1:05:16] about the third pool
[1:05:17] and he talks about the evidence of of
[1:05:19] the third pool he's talking about
[1:05:21] or the vindication of the third pull he
[1:05:23] talks about the creating of squirrels we
[1:05:25] read about that
[1:05:26] it happens twice three the first time
[1:05:29] the next year there's five squirrels
[1:05:31] then he goes to hattie wright's house or
[1:05:32] her parents house and he's talking to
[1:05:34] them about the creation of the squirrels
[1:05:35] and she says that ain't nothing but the
[1:05:37] truth
[1:05:37] and then he stands up and says whatever
[1:05:39] you say you'll be given to you
[1:05:42] now hattie wright wasn't praying
[1:05:47] brother branham wasn't praying when he
[1:05:48] got squirrels god divinely came down and
[1:05:51] told him to ask what he wanted
[1:05:53] hattie wright wasn't praying but to see
[1:05:56] god can only give that kind of authority
[1:05:58] mixed with power
[1:06:00] to somebody who's got character
[1:06:04] and he could tell he said what that
[1:06:06] little lady said pleased the lord
[1:06:09] she caught a revelation that that
[1:06:10] prophet was saying was nothing but
[1:06:12] the truth so pleased the lord they said
[1:06:15] you can have whatever you want because
[1:06:17] he knew
[1:06:17] the character in the heart of that
[1:06:19] little lady wasn't going to ask for a
[1:06:20] million dollars
[1:06:21] was it even going to ask for the healing
[1:06:23] of her sister wasn't even going to ask
[1:06:25] for something for her parents
[1:06:26] she was going to ask for the salvation
[1:06:28] of her two boys
[1:06:30] amen why doesn't god trust us with the
[1:06:33] spoken word
[1:06:34] what's our motive and objective what's
[1:06:35] in our heart do we have the character to
[1:06:37] handle
[1:06:38] that kind of power and authority if he
[1:06:40] come to you right now and said whatever
[1:06:42] you want what would you want
[1:06:44] would it match his will or would it be
[1:06:45] your own will amen the bride's maturing
[1:06:48] into the place
[1:06:49] where she has his word and she knows
[1:06:51] what he wants done with the word
[1:06:53] she has the mind of christ not her own
[1:06:55] mind we're coming to that place brothers
[1:06:57] and sisters where the third pool can
[1:06:59] operate
[1:07:00] hallelujah what's going to bring us
[1:07:02] there the opening of the word
[1:07:05] the third pool has now been vindicated
[1:07:08] and i'm sure you all know what it is
[1:07:10] now remember there'll never be an
[1:07:12] impersonation of that because it can't
[1:07:13] be
[1:07:14] how can you impersonate that
[1:07:18] you can lie about it but you certainly
[1:07:19] can't say squirrels appear and squirrels
[1:07:21] appear you cannot impersonate
[1:07:23] the vindication of the third pool and
[1:07:25] you cannot impersonate the opening of
[1:07:27] the word
[1:07:28] that ties genesis to revelations in
[1:07:30] perfect harmony you can't
[1:07:31] impersonate that
[1:07:37] there'll be never be an impersonation of
[1:07:39] that because it can't be see
[1:07:40] it cannot be now it's in existence
[1:07:43] and i'm warned of this right at this
[1:07:46] time now it's just happened
[1:07:48] so it could identify its presence among
[1:07:50] you
[1:07:52] this third pose happened just now so it
[1:07:55] can identify its presence among you
[1:07:58] in what the wave sheath offering
[1:08:02] and the wave chief offering the third
[1:08:04] pool's identifying its presence among
[1:08:06] you
[1:08:08] but it will not be used in a great way
[1:08:10] until this council begins to tighten up
[1:08:13] and when it does the pentecostals and so
[1:08:16] forth can almost impersonate anything
[1:08:18] can be done
[1:08:19] but when that time comes when what time
[1:08:22] is he talking about
[1:08:23] until this great council begins to
[1:08:25] tighten up that's what he's talking
[1:08:26] about
[1:08:28] but when that time comes when the
[1:08:29] squeeze comes down
[1:08:31] then you'll see what you've seen
[1:08:33] temporarily will be manifest in the
[1:08:35] fullness of its power
[1:08:38] why wave sheaf offering full harvest
[1:08:43] amen wave chief offering
[1:08:46] he says what you've seen temporarily
[1:08:50] you'll see in the fullness of its power
[1:08:55] then he says c c c c
[1:08:59] four times now i must continue in
[1:09:02] evangelism just as i was commissioned
[1:09:05] first i must continue on therefore
[1:09:07] you've had the word and you know what to
[1:09:08] look for
[1:09:09] how to stand i must continue on an
[1:09:11] evangelism and friends of mine keep
[1:09:13] still
[1:09:14] and just keep moving on for the hours
[1:09:16] approaching swiftly see
[1:09:18] that when something is going to be done
[1:09:22] now you might see some little odd things
[1:09:24] happen for me
[1:09:25] nothing sinful i don't mean that but i
[1:09:27] mean something odd to what the regular
[1:09:29] trend because
[1:09:30] where i reach to now in the ministry i'm
[1:09:33] dropping back
[1:09:34] here where did he reach to
[1:09:37] the opening of the seven seals how do
[1:09:39] you go beyond the opening of the seven
[1:09:40] seals
[1:09:43] where i'm reaching my ministry i'm
[1:09:44] dropping back here watching
[1:09:46] that spot what spot the spot of the
[1:09:49] squeeze when the squeeze comes down
[1:09:51] watching that spot
[1:09:55] and waiting for the time to use it but
[1:09:58] it's going to be used
[1:10:01] and everyone knows that for as certain
[1:10:02] as the first was identified
[1:10:04] so has the second been identified he's
[1:10:06] talking about the three pools just as
[1:10:07] the first was identified
[1:10:09] so was the second been identified and if
[1:10:11] you think real closely
[1:10:13] you who are spiritual as the bible said
[1:10:15] here's to them that have wisdom the
[1:10:17] third is properly identified see
[1:10:19] we know where it is so the third pull is
[1:10:22] here
[1:10:24] why because christ has come when at the
[1:10:27] opening of the seals
[1:10:29] christ has come it's so sacred
[1:10:32] that i mustn't say much about it as he
[1:10:35] told me in the beginning
[1:10:36] said this say nothing of it remember
[1:10:38] that years ago
[1:10:40] it speaks for itself see
[1:10:43] i've tried to explain the others and i
[1:10:45] made a mistake this will be the thing
[1:10:47] that to my opinion i don't say the lord
[1:10:48] tells me this
[1:10:49] this will be a thing that will start the
[1:10:52] rapturing faith for the going away
[1:10:54] see listen to what he says here
[1:10:58] i must lay quiet for just a little while
[1:11:04] now remember and who is listening to
[1:11:06] this tape you might see such a change in
[1:11:09] my ministry right away
[1:11:10] dropping back not going up dropping back
[1:11:16] two years after he preached this he's
[1:11:18] dead
[1:11:20] ministries ended in his life
[1:11:23] you might see a change in my ministry
[1:11:25] right away
[1:11:26] dropping back not going up dropping back
[1:11:29] we're right at that age now and it can't
[1:11:32] it can't go any further
[1:11:33] we have to wait just a minute until this
[1:11:36] happens over here
[1:11:38] to catch up what's he talking about when
[1:11:40] the squeeze come down when this great
[1:11:42] council begins to tighten up that's what
[1:11:44] he's referring to
[1:11:45] we have to wait just a minute until this
[1:11:48] happens over here
[1:11:49] to catch up then the time comes but it's
[1:11:52] thoroughly
[1:11:53] identified
[1:11:57] so who's going to have that
[1:11:58] manifestation of the third pool
[1:12:00] prophet's gone we've seen it temporarily
[1:12:05] but you're going to see it in the
[1:12:06] fullness of its power where
[1:12:12] in the message shalom brother venom says
[1:12:15] and we all know that's the
[1:12:16] identification we know that's the third
[1:12:17] pool is
[1:12:18] we all understand that now you've got
[1:12:21] you have the tape see
[1:12:23] and i think listen to what he says i
[1:12:26] think it'll just lay dormant for a
[1:12:28] little while
[1:12:33] until the great hour of persecution
[1:12:35] comes on
[1:12:38] that's when it be it'll speak
[1:12:41] it'll be manifest just like the five
[1:12:43] straight signs without failure perfectly
[1:12:45] when he says those five straight signs
[1:12:47] he's talking about first squirrel second
[1:12:49] squirrels hattie wright
[1:12:52] the storm he speaks to out of existence
[1:12:54] in colorado
[1:12:55] and his wife's tumor the five straight
[1:12:57] times
[1:12:59] and he says and i want to read this
[1:13:01] quote again in shalom
[1:13:02] 1964. and we all know that that's
[1:13:05] the identification we know that what the
[1:13:07] third pool is
[1:13:09] we all we all understand that now you
[1:13:12] you have the tapes see
[1:13:13] and i think it'll just lay dormant for a
[1:13:16] little while has it been laying dormant
[1:13:19] brothers and sisters
[1:13:20] it's been laying dormant until the great
[1:13:23] hour of persecution comes on
[1:13:26] that's when it be it'll speak
[1:13:30] not you'll speak it'll speak
[1:13:33] and when it speaks it needs a mouth and
[1:13:35] whose mouth is it going to be
[1:13:37] i say let it be mine oh god let me live
[1:13:40] a consecrated life
[1:13:41] so obedient to this word that when it's
[1:13:43] time for the third pool to speak when
[1:13:45] it's time for christ to speak again
[1:13:46] that he can use these lips right here
[1:13:49] amen that's the full harvest maturity
[1:13:51] that's what he's coming to where we
[1:13:53] don't go off half cocked we don't say
[1:13:55] what we think we don't just make up
[1:13:56] stuff
[1:13:57] but it's a real genuine divinely
[1:13:59] inspired of god's word
[1:14:01] it's a real genuine faith that's
[1:14:03] revealed to us at the time it's needed
[1:14:05] and we speak and move forward not
[1:14:08] presuming
[1:14:09] no presuming whatsoever but a genuine
[1:14:12] knowing that something that you know
[1:14:14] beyond any shadow of a doubt and you're
[1:14:15] speaking it comes to pass
[1:14:18] we're coming to that time
[1:14:21] amen
[1:14:25] how many believes it's on the doorstep
[1:14:29] we can see everything in the nation
[1:14:30] changing and everything around the world
[1:14:32] changing
[1:14:32] just as there's a persecution coming
[1:14:34] against the jews you better believe
[1:14:36] there's the same persecution coming
[1:14:37] against the bride
[1:14:39] because what happens naturally happens
[1:14:41] spiritually as well
[1:14:42] and brother branham already prophesied
[1:14:44] he already told us what's going to
[1:14:45] happen
[1:14:45] and now that that third pool that that
[1:14:48] spoken word has been laying dormant for
[1:14:50] a little while
[1:14:51] waiting for this persecution to come on
[1:14:53] and then it'll speak
[1:14:55] what's he need he needs a bride in
[1:14:58] maturity
[1:15:00] what's going to bring us to maturity the
[1:15:02] full revelation
[1:15:03] of the full word of god will bring us to
[1:15:06] harvest maturity
[1:15:07] you're not going to get there playing
[1:15:09] games you're not going to get there
[1:15:10] spending all your time with
[1:15:11] entertainment that's not going to work
[1:15:13] brothers and sisters
[1:15:14] we're coming to full harvest maturity
[1:15:16] when it's time to lay aside foolishness
[1:15:18] and things that distract and things that
[1:15:20] take our time and things that divide our
[1:15:22] attention
[1:15:22] and it's time for us to focus on what he
[1:15:24] gave us he gave us the full sunlight of
[1:15:26] his word to bring us the full harvest
[1:15:28] maturity
[1:15:29] and nothing else is going to work i
[1:15:31] don't know about you but i'm ready to go
[1:15:34] oh i'm so ready to go i say consecrate
[1:15:38] me lord
[1:15:40] make me lord if you need a vessel you
[1:15:42] can have this one
[1:15:44] if you've got to clean it up clean it up
[1:15:46] if you've got to purge it
[1:15:47] purge it but use me oh god take me o god
[1:15:51] use me o lord how many would say that's
[1:15:54] your cry
[1:15:56] amen it's time for what we've seen
[1:15:58] temporarily to come into full power
[1:16:01] amen and i say let it be me
[1:16:04] let's all stand musicians if you want to
[1:16:06] come
[1:16:14] i just want to read one scripture
[1:16:16] together while we're standing don't put
[1:16:17] your bibles away quite yet
[1:16:19] in chapter 9 there's an interesting
[1:16:21] wording that i really like
[1:16:24] in esther chapter 9 verse 24
[1:16:29] because haman the son of hamadath of the
[1:16:31] agagite the enemy of all jews had
[1:16:33] devised against the jews to destroy them
[1:16:36] and it casper that is the lot to consume
[1:16:38] them and to destroy them
[1:16:41] is that what the devil's tried to do
[1:16:44] this is a pretty accurate description of
[1:16:46] what the devil
[1:16:46] has tried to do to god's people he's
[1:16:49] tried to consume them
[1:16:51] and he's tried to destroy them but in
[1:16:54] verse 25 it starts off with
[1:16:55] but i love it when it's talking about
[1:16:58] destruction and consuming
[1:17:00] and destroying the people of god and
[1:17:01] then god is so kind to put a butt
[1:17:03] right there but that was haman's plan
[1:17:06] but
[1:17:07] haman had devised but haman has sought
[1:17:09] to consume them but
[1:17:13] when esther you know esther means star
[1:17:19] esther's name was hadassah which means
[1:17:21] myrtle and it was changed to star
[1:17:25] sounds like the royal seat of abraham to
[1:17:27] me are they not the stars in heaven
[1:17:30] this queen happens to be a star
[1:17:34] part of the royal seed of abraham but
[1:17:36] when esther came before the king
[1:17:39] he commanded the letters that this
[1:17:40] wicked device which he devised against
[1:17:42] the dew should return upon his own
[1:17:44] head and that he and his son should be
[1:17:47] hanged
[1:17:48] on the gallows haman has devised a plan
[1:17:52] to destroy your life
[1:17:53] haman has devised a plan to destroy the
[1:17:55] elect's seat of god
[1:17:57] to consume them to destroy them to cast
[1:17:59] them out
[1:18:00] but
[1:18:03] when esther came into the presence of
[1:18:05] the king
[1:18:07] amen everything changed
[1:18:10] amen are you esther have you been in the
[1:18:14] presence of the king
[1:18:15] it's time for everything to change
[1:18:18] all his wicked devices come back on his
[1:18:22] own head
[1:18:24] that's what brother branham said is
[1:18:26] going to happen to the devil
[1:18:28] all his wicked devices through the blood
[1:18:31] of the bleach of jesus christ
[1:18:32] goes right back to the originator
[1:18:35] everything that he put on you
[1:18:37] when you pass through that blood it
[1:18:38] takes it back to its original form
[1:18:40] and what was its original form it came
[1:18:42] from the devil it goes back to the devil
[1:18:44] he's destroyed by his own vices he's
[1:18:46] destroyed by his own plans when
[1:18:48] when esther comes before the king
[1:18:51] hallelujah let's pray
[1:18:54] dear heavenly father we thank you for
[1:18:55] your word lord we just ask that you
[1:18:58] would just
[1:18:58] anoint us lord to take our position just
[1:19:01] like you did esther lord
[1:19:03] a little girl out of obscurity lord you
[1:19:06] cleansed her lord you purified her
[1:19:08] you called her out and you cleanse
[1:19:09] during your purity fire in the house of
[1:19:11] the women
[1:19:12] under the tutelage of haggy eye and lord
[1:19:14] you've done the same thing to us tonight
[1:19:17] god we've heard the instructions of
[1:19:19] haggai and we've we've kept them to the
[1:19:21] tee
[1:19:21] we've not added our own thinking our own
[1:19:23] lifestyle our own design
[1:19:25] but we've went according to all that
[1:19:26] haggai has said
[1:19:28] and lord you've come into your presence
[1:19:30] and you've chosen us lord
[1:19:32] and god we're learning more and more as
[1:19:34] we travel in this life
[1:19:35] what you think of us how precious we are
[1:19:37] to you and that we're joined heirs with
[1:19:38] you and you've given half the kingdom to
[1:19:40] us
[1:19:41] but there's something yet to come in the
[1:19:43] story of esther
[1:19:44] and that's the third pool ministry in
[1:19:46] esther when you tell her
[1:19:48] to say and she speaks not when you
[1:19:52] decree
[1:19:53] but the decree of esther is what begins
[1:19:55] to be written in the book
[1:19:57] lord i just pray that you would let it
[1:19:58] be this humble little people that's here
[1:20:00] tonight
[1:20:01] that we can live such a consecrated life
[1:20:03] to your word that you can purge us by
[1:20:05] your word
[1:20:05] wash us by your word sanctify us and
[1:20:07] cleanse us so that you can use us in
[1:20:09] your service lord
[1:20:11] we saw what you did in the wave chief
[1:20:13] and we're expecting you to do it again
[1:20:15] in the full harvest lord
[1:20:16] i pray that you bring us to maturity and
[1:20:18] help us to be consecrated vessels for
[1:20:20] your kingdom
[1:20:22] oh praise the lord i pray that you would
[1:20:24] defeat haggai and me
[1:20:26] as you would destroy the wiles of the
[1:20:28] enemy in my flesh lord in my life
[1:20:30] by your spoken word that you would have
[1:20:32] the victory in this house right here
[1:20:35] lord i pray that you would speak through
[1:20:37] these lips that you would love
[1:20:38] lord through this body should minister
[1:20:41] through us in jesus christ's name
[1:20:44] we love you lord and thank you and ask
[1:20:45] your blessings as we go
[1:20:47] keep us safely on the road and lord give
[1:20:49] us somebody that we can talk to and
[1:20:51] share this life with
[1:20:53] god i pray that you bless the weekend
[1:20:55] meetings come up bless
[1:20:56] brother abraham as he travels in lord
[1:20:59] help us to come back this weekend with
[1:21:00] great expectations to hear from you
[1:21:03] we love you lord we ask for your
[1:21:04] blessings in jesus christ's name
[1:21:06] amen i just want to remind you in the
[1:21:09] story of esther
[1:21:10] when esther finally got the decree and
[1:21:13] haggy i wrote out the instructions of
[1:21:15] what
[1:21:15] the jews were supposed to do they were
[1:21:18] no longer
[1:21:19] afraid of what their enemies were going
[1:21:21] to do to them
[1:21:22] [Music]
[1:21:24] as soon as the bride had spoken what she
[1:21:26] wanted
[1:21:27] and it was stamped by the seal and put
[1:21:29] in the action
[1:21:30] guess what all of those jews did they
[1:21:33] took up arms and went on the offensive
[1:21:37] our days of defensive are over brothers
[1:21:39] and sisters
[1:21:40] i'm tired of what the devil's trying to
[1:21:42] do to our families i'm tired what he's
[1:21:43] doing to our minds
[1:21:44] tired of what he's doing to our homes
[1:21:46] and amen i'm going to kick him out
[1:21:47] at every turn because i am not on the
[1:21:50] defensive
[1:21:51] anymore because there's been a decree
[1:21:54] that's went out through the bride and
[1:21:55] don't forget
[1:21:56] that brother branham's part of the bride
[1:21:59] he's not separate of the bride he's the
[1:22:01] first part of the harvest that came to
[1:22:02] maturity
[1:22:03] what bro what what part of the harvest
[1:22:05] part of the bride
[1:22:07] the first part of the bride to come to
[1:22:09] harvest maturity he's part of the bride
[1:22:11] he's in the bride those works are still
[1:22:13] in the bride
[1:22:15] amen and when the decree went out
[1:22:17] through the bride
[1:22:18] and mordecai put the seal on it and
[1:22:20] acted in the law
[1:22:22] then the chosen people of god went into
[1:22:24] action
[1:22:25] fighting for their rights
[1:22:28] and i'm fighting for my rights this word
[1:22:30] is my right
[1:22:31] healing is the children's bread
[1:22:33] deliverance from sin
[1:22:34] that's in the book and it's mine and i'm
[1:22:37] no longer in defense of hoping cowering
[1:22:39] that the devil won't come after me again
