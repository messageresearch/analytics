TRANSCRIPT
========================================
look at all the message the preachers in the world and there's one true voice in the world there's not two prophets there's not two voices in the world it's not my voice or your pastor's voice it's the it's God's voice that's speaking back that's right we're not wondering if this message is right even many times it looks like something oh it missed the mark missed the mark and you know the critics are saying everywhere now oh brother BR was wrong here brother was wrong there critic don't pay don't even pay one bit of attention to it amen you know what happened they just didn't listen long enough that's right y amen what seemed to be a question over here was answered over here you go back and try to find all the answers say oh in the first pull yeah oh yeah the seals are not open the Mysteries oh no it's not well you stay there and you'll die right there that's right that's just like trying to go fix up the Methodist and the Baptist or the Pentecostal or the menites or any of them try to fix them back up again how are you going to how you going to do it when the the life is already [Music] left the life is no longer in Luther's message it's the same sanctification Same Spirit that went all the way through but you try to take this message you know and I'm let me I'll be very kind gentle loving I I am I am but I say this you can never you can never change the direction that God's going amen just stay in the direction he's walking that's right from glory to glory to glory he's changing you yeah there's preachers around this message that are trying to change the course of the ministry we're not going back we're going forward I'm all for everything I'm I'm for excitement for joy and peace and joy but we're not going for any subject alone we're walking in all of the light of the world stay right there keep right on walking somebody tries to isolate a little part and put pull it apart watch it the message doesn't change amen every time brother BR when he went to a certain place and said now I've walked till this place he said but now I'm waiting here it is then he come said now I wondered of all those things he said now here it is Sir is this the time and he went by there and he said now watch come back to this tape he said later on said remember I told you this this and that that's right how many times have we done that as ministers there's a little question comes up or a little something then we go back and search it out and say but but he said this over here but it sounds like it's contradicting just keep it walking a little bit there wasn't all the light back then even there comes around in remember how he used to say th talk about the Seven Seals said it's the back part of the book he said it's not even written in the book that's what he used to say right but about the third seal he said I was wrong it's written there but our spiritual eyes was withheld from it as Daniel had been told and John was told that it wouldn't be it wouldn't be revealed to the time of the end so he said God withheld it from us and did let us know all the Mysteries until this age but now he pulled it back and let us know then he took that mystery and revealed the rest of the mystery kept on going kept right on climbing that's right tell what what did we see Behold the Lamb of God Christ The Mystery of God revealed
