to it we're going to look at Ephesians chapter 2 verse one also saw several of the youth are back from Winter youth retreat I trust you had a good time there I see some visitors too God bless you all you're certainly welcome to join in with us today amen Ephesians chapter 2 verse1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desire of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and he hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen praise God Amen God bless you as you have your seats amen man I just remembered as I looked back I looked for brother Ben to thank him for service and I realized he's away preaching this weekend he's down in I believe it's Virginia he's preaching uh for his brother-in-law down there so please remember them and prayer but as we look at this scripture we realize that we were dead in sins and trespasses remember uh uh a little more than a week ago I don't remember when it was we preached on true life and true death what death really is brother bham taught us death is separation amen and we were born and we were separated alienated from the things of God having our mind darkened Amen to the things of God we were dead amen though we were breathing oxygen and out we were dead amen dead in sins and trespasses amen but God ha quickened us amen he brought us out of that dead condition and quickened us to life why because there was a seed of eternal life already on the inside amen and not just quickened us but raised us up together and SE and we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise God we can rejoice in that for this morning I'd like to take a subject on our part in this Resurrection our part in this resurrection and I'm going to take my uh that this U title comes out of this next quote from the message it is the rising of the sun brother M says as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheath what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message amen so what's going to be the first thing that comes when it's time for a resurrection amen that's why I said our part in this Resurrection what is this Resurrection it's a resurrection out of dead denominationalism amen so I'll read that again and for the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denomination what is the bright age it's a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live ye live also speaking to his wife who was he speaking to he was speaking to his wife amen because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power amen further down in the rising of the sun he goes on to say and the sun has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last day where is the Sun going to be revealed in the bride amen the sun has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last day the quickening power has got to come Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to a Living Word of the Living God Amen we were stuck in darkness amen but the quickening power has come amen what has come the wave sheath has come proving it was the first one to mature the first one what the first part of that end time word to come to maturity amen it came to maturity in our brother amen but what was it it was the Life of Christ it was Christ who come to maturity in that vessel and that gift was taken and weighed before us what was weigh before us the word was weighed before us not a human being amen the word come to maturity in a vessel absolutely was betrayed through a vessel but it was the word amen that was waved over the people seeing that the time of the prophecy was nigh and the Word was waved over the people praise be to God and then it brought the quickening power amen the opening of the word brought the quickening power The Life of Christ amen back to the the church to Quicken us out of denominations and Creeds into the word amen Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to The Living Word of the Living God oh what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is at the end of the church ages Amen to bring us up out of the Creeds and ideas and the Darkness of man into the fullness of the light I want to turn to John 11 we're going to spend a lot of time in the Book of John so keep your Bible handy and keep your place here in John and remember I want to look at our part in this resurrection and and we see now that the what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is this is a resurrection that's going on resurrecting God's bride his true elect seed he's quickening them out of the deadness of denominations out of the darkness of denominations and Creeds and Quicken him into the fullness of Life In Christ because the son has got to be revealed again in the bride amen so he's got to bring them out of the trappings of denominations got to bring them out of the darkness of man's Creeds and man's interpretation of the word and bring them to the fullness of life so that they can manifest the sun again amen so in John chap 11 I want to look at The Story of Lazarus and I want to take this subject through this story and in John chap 11 we we've preached on this I want to just St a claimer I've preached done all of this before but my goodness it's come to life to me on a whole new level amen and so amen so don't expect it to be brand new just expect me to be excited about it amen amen in John 11 verse1 it says now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha and it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sing therefore his sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death before the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus when he had heard therefore that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into Judea again so we find that word comes to Jesus that Lazarus is sick amen and it says the message says Lord whom the the one whom thou lovest is sick and so there was a acknowledgement that God loved Lazarus and the name Lazarus which I think is important in the story the name Lazarus means whom God helps whom God helps amen but it's amazing how God helps Lazarus amen it's not God's ways are not like our ways God's mind is not like our mind God doesn't think amen the way that we in human flesh think his thoughts are so much higher higher than ours when word comes that Lazarus thy friend is sick amen the one whom you love is sick Jesus doesn't jump up and run immediately to the word to go spare Lazarus from this trial and take away all his problems he delays two days amen and he makes a statement he says he says this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God Amen that the Son of God might be glorified thereby amen Jesus is not jumping up to take away all of the pain and suffering and misery and sickness from Lazarus whom he loves because God knows that there's a greater purpose in this trial amen then if he would just take it away it wouldn't have come there's something greater coming to Lazarus and he's got to endure just a little bit longer so Jesus delays and his delay sometimes is so misinterpreted amen sometimes for us God delays we call and he doesn't come we call and he doesn't respond immediately we cry out God don't you see I'm sick I'm in need and all the a sudden there's a delay and all and the devil begins to work in the delay like well I thought that he loved him I thought that that you were the Beloved of the Lord I thought that his promises were to you and in the delay we can begin to misinterpret the delay amen it was no sign that he had lost love for Lazarus it was no sign that his affection had changed it was no sign that he had lost his power but he clearly stated that this sness he knew knew amen that this sickness was not unto death but for the glory of God that the son of man might be glorified thereby amen why was Lazarus suffering for the glory of God that's right why was Mary and Martha grieved for the glory of God why was Devastation hitting their house so that the son of man might be glorified thereby oh I pray that God is bringing us to another level of maturity amen where we start to see things the way God sees them and quit panicking every time something happen and say I don't understand it but there's a purpose behind it I don't know why it's delayed but he does everything well amen he hasn't changed his mind about me amen as we heard Wednesday night that was set in the mind of God before the foundation of the world he's not changing his mind he's not like a man who changes his mind brother man said he's not ever learning amen he knew from the beginning all things and God delays because the for the glor of God that the son of man might be glorified thereby let's not misinterpret amen the delay let's go to verse 11 these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may wake him out of sleep then said his disciples then said his disciples Lord if he sleep he shall do well how be it Jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had SP spoken of taking of rest and sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there I thought he loved him I thought he loved Martha and Mary I thought he loved Lazarus and he and he says uh Lazarus is dead why did he say Lazarus was dead because first he told them the truth Lazarus sleepeth amen they didn't understand the language that he was speaking so he brought it down to a term they would understand Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there amen what the disciples were going to benefit from this delay disciples were going to benefit amen from the situation going from bad to worse amen it went from bad to worse in the eyes of the human beings that were all around amen it went from bad to Impossible it went from bad to finish it went from bad to completely over amen but in the eyes of God there was nothing finished nothing over amen he already had a plan so the delay was perfect and Jesus tells his disciples amen I Lazarus is dead okay what you understand to be dead he's not breathing anymore the body's inanimate he's laid in the grave so so according to your language he's dead and I am glad I'm happy yeah for your sakes that I was not there to the intent that ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him oh this is for the glory of God amen that the son of man might be glorified thereby man I don't know about you but as I stand and read this scripture I'm glad he didn't go amen because we know the rest of the story I'm glad he didn't go you know what I'm also glad that he didn't heal the prophet and me when the prophet had a stomach condition that cycled every seven years I'm glad he didn't heal him all along the way because along that he's showing his glory his strength his ability and at the End Amen when it comes into the eighth cycle then God shows him a vision and finishes I'm glad amen that there was somebody to show us the love of God continues through trials and God uses it for his purpose that was for my sake I'm glad for the trials that they all went through in the Bible it was for my I'm glad amen I'm glad for my sake that he didn't sh save them from all trouble I'm glad for my sake that he didn't keep them from ever having harm or any difficult ulty I'm so thankful now that I saw the hand of God come through trial and tribulation and hardship amen and it never changed God's love it never changed God's purpose amen it worked perfect according to his purpose and I'm glad for my sake that I might believe Amen brother Bram says amen you say brother Bram I'm a Christian and I got sick now I wonder why it come God may be purging you give you some trials make you draw a little closer to him pray a while then heal you that you can have a testimony amen you know anytime we come and ask somebody to share a testimony I I don't remember ever hearing a testimony that says I had no trouble I lived a perfect life I never suffered a day nothing ever went wrong and I just want to share that as a testimony our testimonies always start with trouble what we declare to our neighbors what we declare to our families what we declare to show the word of God is still in effect is when everything goes wrong and sometimes from bad to worse amen and then God comes on the scene and brings us amen from bad to worse to Impossible and brings a solution supernaturally all of a sudden now we've got a testimony for the glory of God so the son of man might be declared amen amen so let's go down to verse 17 now then when Jesus come he found that he had Lain in the grave 4 days already now remember I remember when the prophecy went forth from David he said he not shall not let his holy one see corruption and the prophet of God brings us that verse over and over and shows see corruption sets in after 72 hours and so it shows it was a prophecy showing he would rise within 3 days he wouldn't let that body see corruption and now now we see here that he led in the grave four days already showing that corruption had already set into the flesh brother B said it already begin to rot amen Martha already says but by now Lord he stinketh amen you mean it went from bad to worst to impossible to finished yeah that body is now Rotten amen you think a rotten Body Matters an ounce to the person who created the body to begin with am me he created every cell created every atom created the DNA created the elements that he took your body out of Amen before there was anything you were in his mind and when he laid out the material on the earth your body was already laying there as a great Carpenter he laid out the material that would make you do you think a rotten body amen can stop it do you think a cancer cell do you think a perverted a perverted Life coming into your life to bring sickness would ever stop him there's nothing impossible it's never gone too far brother BR said there's a spoonful of Ashes he'll resurrect it in the end time [Music] amen and that's true for this Resurrection here how can our life get so degraded so cast down so far away from God that God can't raise it back amen by the quickening power of this word praise God praise God he laying in the grave four days already now Bethany was n into Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was come went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou H has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection am I just want to say something if you're looking for the resurrection you can find it today he is the resurrection oh we're looking for a resurrection when all the Sleeping Saints through the seven Church ages will rise Amen in glorified bodies absolutely that still lays ahead of us but if you're looking for that Resurrection you can find it now today CU he is the resurrection and the life amen I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this she said to him yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world Amen Martha is not an unbeliever but she's a Believer amen amen so let's go to verse 33 now verse 33 when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have you laid him they said unto him Lord come and see Jesus wept then said the Jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died Jesus therefore again groaned in himself cometh to to the grave and it was a cave and a stone lay upon it Jesus was was groaning within himself and they they he saw the suffering he saw the Weeping and and they they they claimed that they believed whatever he said would happen and and now they're weeping CU Lazarus is gone and he's overcome with the with the whole scene amen and now they questioned they said look how he loved him if this man who loved him so couldn't he have prevented him from dying that's a good question if God loves you so much couldn't he have prevented all the hardship trials and troubles that were in your life the the truth is he could have but why didn't he maybe those trials are for the glory of God that the son of man might be glorified glorified thereby let's let him get glory in it all so then he he wants to know where they're laid where they've laid him and in verse 38 it says Jesus therefore again groan and himself come to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it where did they put him they put him in a cave and they rolled a big Stone across the face of it and I love what brother bam says in the restoration of the brid tree he makes a statement about the inment of Jesus Christ he says now to rid him out of their sight they hated him so bad because he tore up their organizations to rid him out of their sight they buried him and rolled a great big denominational Stone over the door so he'd be sure not to rise again amen what did they do to Christ amen what was Christ Christ was the anointed word for the day what did they do to Christ they took the word They Crucified the word they buried the word and they rolled a big denominational Stone over the door to make sure that the word didn't rise again that's exactly what denominations have done to this precious word it came forth on the day of Pentecost the promise came forth and what did they do immediately amen the devil got to work through the white horse rider amen and and the the red horse rider what's he doing he was trying to bury that word amen and roll a big denominational Stone over the door Amen to make sure it didn't Rise Again further in in the restoration of the Bride tree says then they didn't like it so many people standing there crying about it so they took him off they said well we'll make our denom Nation so tight that they'll never get them holy rollers in here so they scoot him back in a hole of Joseph of arthea and they rolled a great big Stone took a century of men to roll it up there did you ever see the other night in the picture the big path they rolled the stone up weighs tons rolled their big organization Stone up there so he could not raise up but did that hold him no but I will restore sayeth the Lord look what he goes to he doesn't just leave it there to ,000 years ago he comes right back to the church in the dark age but I will restore what's he preaching the restoration of the brid tree but I will restore sayeth the Lord let's hit that text now and drive it I will restore sayith the Lord I'll restore him three days I'll raise him back up they couldn't hide him in that rock what is what was that grave amen it was Rock Amen Rock symbolizes the word and rock symbolizes the Revelation but what they had done is they carved them out a hole and they took the word and they made a grave out of it man dug it out himself he chiseled out and dug it out and he made a man-made Stone amen and he shaped it to roll in front of the door amen what did he do they tried to take the word to bury the word what has denominations done what book do they use Amen to stop the word they use the same word amen that's supposed to bring life and they bring the same word in add their own interpretation to it and twist that word to bring death that's what serpent did to Eve amen all the way in the beginning he twisted the word and now their man-made ideas have dug out a grave and they take the word amen crucify the word and bury the word in their man-made cave and roll a man-made door over it to ceal him out and on top of that they have fixed the seal on Jesus Christ amen tomb and it was a Roman seal praise God amen why because on Easter morning he broke the Roman seal and rolled the stone away and the word came forth again the same things happened through the church ages amen he broke the Roman seal he rolled the stone away and Christ the word has returned to the church they couldn't keep him down under their man-made Stone right praise be to God this is just what man does he takes what was meant for life and he twists it into death and serves his own purpose because they love Darkness greater than light amen it was a misuse of the word how did they condemn Jesus they used they tried to use the law of Moses same thing with the disciples they they tried to condemn them using the law they tried to condemn Paul using the law they could justify killing them because of their Twisted understanding of the word amen don't think that spirit's gone still here trying to condemn crucify bury and keep buried the Living Word because it exposes the darkness of denominations exposes the darkness of religion in man's ideas that's right amen they would love to kill it put it in the grave and roll their own big understanding Rock right over it yeah but the Roman seal couldn't hold that stone and the Roman seal amen is a seal denominationalism because the first denomination is the Roman Catholic church amen that same Roman system that that was a pagan system moved to a paple system amen and it began the whole sequence of events that would end up where we are now with tens of thousands of denominations and what are they they are the harlots they are the daughters of the the great is the Catholic church but that church has daughters and those daughters are churches and those churches are the Protestant movements amen that have gone right back into the same denominationalism with taking man's ideas on the word amen and and and and hemming it down and pushing out the light they done the same thing so here we find Lazarus and where is Lazarus amen Lazarus was sick Hey listen I'll tell you we were all born sick in hybrid ization and Lazarus was sick we were born sick and why did God let this sickness come to this this sickness of hybridization the sickness of a mind darkened and alienated from God Amen why did we come this is for the glory of God also amen God didn't prevent it amen it happened that sickness came and that sickness moved into death and when when Lazarus died they stuck him in a man-made cave and they rolled a man-made rock over the door and they buried him under the stone but in Psalms 41 verse one it says I waited patiently for the Lord and He inclined unto me and he heard My Cry he brought me up also out of the horrible pit out of the my clay and he set my feet upon a rock and established my goings what does God do with the rock God doesn't stick you under the Rock and seal you away under a man-made Stone but God sits you upon the rock the rock becomes the foundation of the Believers a firm foundation that makes them unmovable amen it's the foundation stone in Christ was the Chief Cornerstone the foundation that the apostles and Prophets built off of to make a foundation of the word to do what to lift his children higher in Revelation not put them under the ground but the systems of man take the word to bury the Believers buried in denomination buried in Tradition buried in Dogma buried in Creed but God takes us out of the grave and sets us upon the rockah in Psalms 27 which is the psalm brother bham goes to in the Rapture in verse 5 he says for in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted above mine enemies around about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle Le sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises into the Lord when is he going to sing praises into the Lord in the time of trouble why can he sing praises into the joy why can he be joyful because God has set him up upon a rock and lifted his head up above and this doesn't just mean amen that he's a physically higher than all of his all of his enemies when he set him on the Rock and lifted his head he brought his Revelation and understanding higher than all of his en enemies and he could realize though a host to Camp about me they won't destroy me though they all gather they won't defeat God's purpose inside of me because he has set me on this rock of revelation of his word and now my head is higher than all my enemies that's what God does the for with the rock for the Believers man's constantly trying to put get you in the system and Under The Rock and trap you yeah with the word but God is freeing us with the word and the same rock that the denom are trying to put us under Christ is taking us out and putting us on the Rock and it becomes the foundation stone for us remember the rock that was cut out of the mountain without hands Amen in Daniel's Vision That Rock Amen whomever that rock fell on it crushed him and ground the powder amen but whoever fell on the Rock Amen was broken and rebuilt amen I want to fall on the Rock Amen I want to fall on that foundation stone amen The Rock when when Jesus was giving the parable and said two men build a house one in sand one on the Rock Amen and the storms came amen listen in both of their lives storms came neither one was spared the storm right the Christian or the make believer they both had the same storm amen and against the both houses the storm and the wind and and the waves beat vehemently Hey listen just because one person had chose the better place to build his house didn't mean he had any less of a storm than the foolish man the wise man and the foolish man had the same storm the same trial with the same intensity the difference was the foundation amen one was on the sinking sand of man's ideas and traditions and dogmas increase the other one was planted on the Firm Foundation of the revelation of Jes Jesus Christ and it became unmovable no matter what storm came it was unmovable that's what the word is to the believer the foundation the support the underg guarding that lifts us up amen even the scripture says uh Jesus is a our Lord is a strong tower the name of the Lord is a strong tower that the righteous run into in our safe a strong tower is not a dungeon a strong tower is Stone built together that lifts you higher above the storm praise God so when you see a system of man amen I don't care where it's at when they try to keep people under the word and pushed down and locked down by the word I would flee from that because this word is supposed to put us on a foundation stone amen and Lift Us higher not push us lower praise be to God Amen then we come to John 11:38 verse 39 I mean Jesus said take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead sayith in him Lord by this time he stinketh for he has been dead four days Jesus said to them take ye away the stone Jesus wasn't going to take it away he know he knew what God would do he knew the sickness was not unto death before it started he knew that there'd be a resurrection because he says Lazarus is asleep but I go to wake him he knew he was coming in a resurrection Ministry in the resurrection phase of his ministry he knew he was coming Amen to speak the word that would resurrect Lazarus but Jesus wasn't going to do it all by himself he come and he says ye take away the stone amen and brother Bram tells us God always works through man man is God's agency amen he says he says they went down to the Grave there stood a man there stood God in flesh that could have said to the stone dissolve and it would have dissolved this man who could walk on water he could break bread and multiply amen he could speak to the storm and the winds and the waves and they ceas he could have spoke that that stone right out of existence he could have rolled it away with his word amen whatever he wanted to do he could have done but he did exactly what he wanted and intended to do he could have dissolved it but he said to them women them Poor Little Women little young woman said take away the stone you got something to do too amen they rolled away the stone praise God Amen we want God to do all the work amen but there's something for us to do too we've got to testify we've got to declare we've got to roll the stone away amen so that somebody can hear the voice of God in this Resurrection season cuz what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is this is the Resurrection season this is resurrection out of Dead denominationalism Rising to the fullness of Christ in the bright a to the full risen son this is the resurrection this is the season of Resurrection but in the season of Resurrection somebody's got to roll the stone away who's going to do that I say God help me amen give me strength give me wisdom give me the understanding to roll people Stones away brother Jad how you do that I don't know how to do it I don't know how they did it all I know is he said roll the stone away and if I can expose denomination if I can tell people that that stone is holding you down but there's more to this word there's more to this life if if I can roll that denominational Stone off the mouth of a cave amen then he can speak to them and they can be resurrected amen he says the prophet again says remember God only works through man he chose man he could have he could have had the gospel preached through the stars or through the trees or through the wind but he chose man amen amen we'll see the this as we keep moving let's look at verse 41 then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stood by I said it that they might believe that thou Hast sent me and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound handed foot with grave clothes here he speaks to Lazarus amen they they rolled the stone away you know it's amazing Jesus had the power of Resurrection but he didn't speak until they got into action and rolled the stone away what's the point of resurrecting Lazarus to keep him behind the rock right Lord to keep him trapped in man's Traditions to keep him trapped amen behind the rock of false revelation of denominationalism why resurrect him to keep him behind the we got to move that stone away amen so they can come to life and recognize that they're free they don't have to stay there you don't have to stay in all these Traditions you don't have to stay in all these ideas of men but you can come out when you hear his voice and this is this is a this quote that I want to get to and it was so astounding me amen because I knew that I wanted the preest this more than a week ago amen so when brother brother Ben came and used this quote I was I was sitting in my study watching the Serv I was like oh man they got my quote he said Is it true that every Jew born since Christ that come into the world is to be saved this is questions and answers on the seals said no nothing will be saved only those whose names are put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentile see that's all the book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names you understand now see the book doesn't say now le Veil is to be saved in the time of this church age or or man Neville or whoever no it don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it amen what is it what is called the resurrection in this season it's the voice of God Amen it's the voice of Christ calling out to us how is he calling our name remember when he says he he didn't say come forth because if he would have hollered come forth brother Braham said everyone that had been laying there dead would have come cuz he's the voice of the Resurrection he is the resurrection and the life and if he would have screamed with a loud voice come forth everybody would have come forth but he was specific amen he wasn't calling everybody forth in this this Resurrection he was only calling a certain one forth in this Resurrection he was calling the one whose name was Lazarus whom God helps amen and Lazarus needed God's help CU he was dead in sin and trespasses he was locked behind denominational walls amen but he needed God's help and he was looking for somebody specific to resurrect in this age and he said Lazarus come forth amen and and how is he calling your name today brother man says he's not saying leave or or Orman Neville what he's doing is he's unfolding the mystery that was trapped behind those seals The Mystery of the entire book The Mystery of God and as he unfolds the mystery it calls your name amen because your name is Jesus Christ amen when it comes down to it you're part of Christ the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named Jesus Christ you're part of that word when the word unfolds it calls your name because it's word coming to word and there's a connection of of life to life and the word Springs forth responding to itself what's the voice calling you what called you amen did you hear your name no well you didn't hear the Earthly name you have with the pronunciation and whatever your mother tongue was amen you realize it's not that kind of language it's a language of Revelation it's a language of the word it transcends vocal language amen we may use vocabulary we may use the vocal cords to declare it but there could be a man standing here in this pull pit preaching but you're not hearing a man what wakes that seed up is the very voice of God speaking to you and that voice of God may come through human lips but the voice of God is the manifested word for this day it is the word amen that has been locked up in the mind of God separated from the understanding of man behind those seals that has come forth that is the voice of God in this day and it's calling a resur Resurrection not for all to come out of the grave but only for his bride he's calling Bride come out of the Grave Mrs Jesus Christ arise and if you're Mrs Jesus Christ you hear your name Co let's turn back to John chapter 5 for just a minute John chapter 5 verse 24 says verily verily I say unto you this is John 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life it shall not come into the condemnation but is passed from death into life verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is amen yeah when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live amen I'm telling you the resurrection is on now amen there's those that are dead in sin and trespasses I was dead in sin and trespasses amen but that the hour is coming no for me the hour was now when though I was dead and separated from God Amen alienated from the things of God but I Heard a Voice amen I heard a voice and it may been on a magnetic tape because back then I still listen to tapes but I listened to a tape and I heard a voice of a man from Kentucky but there was something behind the voice that struck something in me and it wasn't just a human lip to a human ear but it was lip of God to ear of my soul and there was a connection made and I come out of that dead denominationalism I awoke out of the darkness of [Music] man so the hour is coming and now now is cuz this is the Resurrection season when those that are dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God then they that hear shall live they that here brother bam told us we you go to John or I'm sorry you go to Revelations chapter 2 and chapter 3 the spirit now saith to him that hath an ear let him hear amen you realize everybody that's born has ears and by and large the majority can hear out of those ears there are some that are born deaf but the normal is people are born than they can hear but this is speaking about a different kind of hearing he that hath ears let him hear amen and Jesus says all that hear the voice of the son of man amen that that that is not just vocal cords hitting this amen but if you hear the voice with the same ears the spirit was speaking to the church in Revelations 2 and 3 that same ear can hear the same voice today and if that ear hears that voice it brings a resurrection but somebody has to roll the stone away somebody's got to be willing to say you know those denominations aren't right yeah you know God never ordained that you know you can be free you don't have to stay stuck in a tradition you don't have to stay stuck you can believe all the word and all the word can work in your life amen somebody's got to roll the stone away let's go back to John chapter 11 John Chapter 11 in verse 44 and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound with a napkin Jesus said unto him loose him and let him go amen it's amazing that he's resurrected from the dead the stone was rolled away the voice of the Resurrection called his name and he come to life but he came out of the Grave still Bound in Graves cloth amen he was alive he was resurrected amen he he had heard the voice the stone was rolled away light struck the seed the voice of the Resurrection struck the seed inside he come to life but he's limited he can't see clearly cuz there's a napkin over his face so maybe the light coming through he could walk out of the Grave cuz he could see the light and walk towards the light he could hear some things through the napkin he was moving amen but he was limited Amen in his movement he was obstructed amen why because before they stuffed him in a man-made cave they wrapped him in grave clothes to keep him Bound in death they clothed him for death they did not clothe him for life he had grave clothes not Life clothes amen because the dirty rags of man's denomination and man's right is a grave clothes that's wrapped around a many a human being and when he come forth Jesus had did his part the voice of the resurrection and woke him up and now Jesus says loose him you loose him amen you take those dirty rags off of him you tell him the truth you show him the word teach him amen take those grave clothes off of him amen what is our job in this Resurrection amen he's showing us what our job is amen we're here amen as agents of God on this Earth amen and we can roll that Big Stone of denomination away and let the revelation of the word strike somebody's heart and they come to life but when they come up it's not an instant Freedom amen they're still dragging along the baggage from denomination dragging along Baptist Theology and Pentecostal Theology and all Catholic theology and they're all bound up and tight but God wants us set free amen and so what does he say he speaks to his agents that are around him he said loose him and let him go free teach him the truth show him the word free him from all of those denominational systems from The Works of man from The Bondage of misunderstanding free him Jesus said our Creeds and denominations has bound many of our people that's true and they come forth even coming to the message they're sometimes still bound amen abely that's why sometimes it takes some patience you realize what's wrong with you didn't you hear the voice of yeah I heard the voice of the Resurrection amen why there's still people they've heard the voice of the Resurrection they've come to life but they're still Bound by Traditions amen and what's it going to take it's going to take the brothers and sisters that are around Amen to loose them from the bondage of denominational thinking because it's been entrained in them since they were children amen I have to do this to have the Holy Ghost I've got to do this to please God to be a Christian I have to do this if this happens God's mad at me amen we got to loose them from all of those grave clothes so that they can go free and what do we loose them with the word of God that's been revealed in this hour this message that's put in our hands amen it's the scissors that cut the grave clothes and unwinds them from all the the false teaching over 2,000 years amen amen amen and John chapter 8 flip back there with me for just a minute John chapter 8 verse 31 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed now listen he didn't say if you follow me right now yeah amen they were disciples right then but many of them wouldn't be disciples later if you continue in my word why because in order to prove that you're seed you've got to go all the way to the end Judas went far he made it to the Last Supper he went through feet washing he went through communion but he didn't make it to Pentecost if you continue in my word then you are my disciple indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free what what will make them free and listen I love the next statement they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou you shall that that ye shall be made free they're all of a sudden confused we're Christians yeah right what do you mean we're in bondage we're Christians and and he goes on he says Jesus answered them verely verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin sin is unbelief amen is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed I know that you're Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father all of a sudden they're all kinds of confused because Jesus says if you if you continue in my word amen men then you shall be my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free what makes us free the truth makes us free Hey listen it doesn't matter what your situation is the truth makes you free you say I'm I'm in a bad situation at work I'm in a bad situation in my home I'm in a bad situation in my family you are free if the truth has set you free amen because what is the real bondage in this life it's not even being in prison it's not even being sick amen that's not the real bondage the real bondage is having your mind alienated and darkened against the things of God and and absolutely being separated from the life of God what is freedom when that truth sets us free that's the real freedom and the sun shall make you free you'll be free indeed let's go back to John chapter 11 see as we follow the Story of Lazarus we find in the Resurrection season Jesus Christ the manifested word for his day was in partnership with the people in that day and I believe he's in partnership with his bride amen the prophet of God told us that the the the voice of God is in the bride she is the mouthpiece of God she is the one declaring the word she is one propagating the message she is one who's been given this treasure and God is in Partnership he is the voice of the Resurrection bringing life but he's asking us to roll away the stone he's asking us when somebody goes free would you take a little time and loose them I mean would you I I imagine that process wasn't quick or easy easy they were bound and wrapped in grave clothes right and when when Martha said surely Lord when he said roll away the stone he stinketh by now though Lazarus was completely restored inside those grave clothes I'm sure those grave clothes still sankk I'm sure they were a little corrupted and a bit nasty but somebody had to go take those off of Lazarus so that he could go free am mean can we be patient enough to draw alongside somebody and unwrap them amen although the clothes May stink and though we may not like it and it's foul in many ways can we take a little time and unbind them to say oh praise God yeah yeah you you heard the truth you come to life and there's yeah I'm alive and we don't want to be partially Unbound I don't want to be partially Unbound I want to be completely set free amen I don't want to be dragging around old grave clothes old stinky nasty Creeds and dogmas of man amen still wrapped around my leg still tied around my ankle still inhibiting my movement I don't want any grave clothes on me and we realize friends when we come out of the darkness of denomination sometimes it takes a long time for the word to wash that stuff out of us but oh our brothers and sisters can help us go free amen we can recognize in one another hey brother have youever ever thought about this or or when somebody comes and they say we have to do this and we have to do that you can say why do you have to do this and why the prophet said this the scripture says this amen Let's help each other get free from our own grave clothes I want to be completely free in this day of Resurrection don't want to be inhibited or limited or still with the stink of a Creed amen that's right that had been wrapped for death yeah don't want it still tied to me in any way but I want to go free amen it's why I love so much the preaching of the word man I can sit under the preaching of the word and God can use a vessel to start pulling more of those threads away amen amen let's now go to let's go to John 12 now this is after the resurrection of Lazarus and he's restored he's freed says verse one chapter 12:1 then Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead so he comes back to the same place now only Lazarus is very much alive restored to his sisters and let's go to verse n says much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was was there and they came not for jesus' sake only but that they might see Lazarus also who him whom he had raised from the dead but the chief priest consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus oh praise God when Jesus says this sickness is not unto death he knew knew what he was talking about this sickness is not un death but for the glory of God that the son of man might be glorified thereby because now Lazarus was the one who was called from the grave Lazarus was the one who was set free Lazarus was now resurrected and Lazarus was testifying of Christ amen now they didn't want to just kill Jesus but now they had to kill Lazarus because Lazarus was the reason people were believing why did God bring you to life why did he bring you out of the denomination why is he cut the grave clothes off of you so that somebody else can believe in this resurrected Christ in our day the one who has the voice of the Resurrection the one who is the resurrection and the life today amen the resurrection and the life is here today and who's testifying of it who's giving witness of it amen there's been lazarus's Lazarus is he whom God helps I was a Lazarus but I'm one who God helped he brought me out of the Grave amen there was somebody that he could tell to roll the stone away and when I was trapped in darkness God would send a friend along who would begin to testify of the truth and say God sent a prophet and these denominational systems are a man and somebody rolled the doorway for me and gave me some tapes and I heard the voice myself and I came to life but I'm so thankful there was a body of Believers around who were patient and kind and endured all my foolishness as a young believer so that they could help unwrap all the grave clothes off of me so that I could go free and what was the purpose of all of it amen amen for the glory of God Amen so the son of man can be glorified thereby this sickness is not unto death this sickness of hybridization that we all fell into this sickness is not unto death amen God could have stopped it amen but he didn't stop it because it's for the glory of God Amen the Fall In the Garden of Eden amen it's for the glory of God and that the son of man might be glorified thereby amen our hybridization the fall of the world Amen the earth going into chaos what's it for it's for the glory of God this sickness was not unto death amen even though I was trapped in the deadness of denominationalism and dead and separated from God the purpose was not for death but the purpose was for life so that he could come in the end time the voice of the resurrection and bring me out of of the Grave amen so that now they don't just have a problem with Jesus they have a problem with he whom God helps I'm telling you it's a good thing when they have a problem with you why because you're testifying of the Resurrection this is for the son of man to be glorified thereby amen they knew they came to Jesus at Martha and Mary and lazarus's house not just because Jesus was there but because Lazarus whom he raised from the dead was there right why cuz Lazarus had a testimony that I was dead but now I'm alive all his family around him knew he was dead he was buried he was stinking you know some of us were dead and we were stinking already our lives were in chaos and in ruin and even we were trying to be Christians we were doing a lousy job of it our hypocrisy was bleeding through we had stinky grave clothes of denominational Creeds and dogmas trying to live a life with no Holy Ghost to live no new birth but with an old nature trying to live a Christian Life and we were wrapped in death garments and we were stinking already and our family knew it and there was plenty around that could testify of Lazarus Resurrection amen you could say I live such a horrible life I was such a hypocrite I did so many wrong things that just means there's plenty of people around to witness that you were resurrected from the dead there's plenty of people to testify that you heard the voice of resurrection and you come to life and now they're testifying you're testifying and everybody's testimony is collaborating that they were this way but something miraculously changed in their life and now look at them they're free they're alive they're healthy they're vibrant they're serving God and what are they doing they're testifying that Christ is alive and Christ is is here and he has the power of resurrection and now they don't just want to kill Jesus they want to kill Lazarus is it any wonder why brother bam said they're going to have a cowardly plot to try to shut down the bride but they'll never stop her she'll be caught up why because as we begin to testify and manifest the life and roll Stones away remove grave clothes and testify and testify and testify it's going to create a big problem in the religious world and I I I'm Duty bound to create a big problem in the religious world not because I want a problem in the religious world but because I'm here to testify that he lives I'm here to testify there's resurrection power in this message I'm here to testify that Christ is here the voice of the Resurrection is here and he's calling to individuals that are in grav and I'm here to roll away as many stones as I can roll away by proclaiming claiming the truth so somebody can hear his voice amen Jesus told his disciples when he was praying over them in John 4 17 he's saying God I don't pray for them alone but for them also which Shall Believe on believe on me through their word amen how are they believing after Jesus left through their word how are they believing now through your word you who've been resurrected you who've come out of dark denominationalism you who've had the grave clothes taken off of you amen you're a testimony amen and many will believe amen not just because of Jesus but they believe now because of Lazarus am let's go to John chapter 7 John chapter 7: 37 listen just is just set the stage because it's so beautiful we've talked about it before but I can't not talk about it here we are at the Feast of Tabernacles what is the Feast of Tabernacles it's the seventh feast and brother brandham said we're feasting now under the Feast of Tabernacles the seventh Church age says in future home so now we're feasting under the Feast of trumpets or I'm sorry Feast of Tabernacles the seventh feast and Jesus is now he's coming to the feast listen his Brethren said why don't you go up into the feast and declare yourself because nobody declares himself a prophet and stays at home go declare yourself and he says it's not my time to go to the feast yet I love the language of the Bible it's so perfect it's not my time to go to the feast but then the Bible says that he came to the feast in the midst of the feast he comes somewhere in the middle of the seventh Church age not at the beginning in 1906 but somewhere in the middle he comes along and he says he did so secretly amen he secretly comes into the seventh feast in the midst of the feast he comes secretly into the seventh feast and he begins to teach and they don't know who he is and they start to question say who is this and what is he saying and is this the Christ is this the one that they're looking for and there's a big confusion over him why because he came secretly in the midst of the seventh Feast this message Christ came sec secretly in the midst of the seventh Church age then it says verse 37 and the last day the great day of the feast what is the great day of the seventh Feast this is one of those special feasts that have two sabbaths this is a special Feast that doesn't just go seven days this Feast goes eight days amen the beginning of the feast is a sacred Sabbath amen and the beginning of this seventh Feast was the sacred Sabbath of the day of Pentecost and then you have a week you have seven days amen but at the end of seven days you go to the eighth day and this is what it talks about in Leviticus 23 and on the eighth day now there's a holy convocation now there's another sacred Sabbath amen and brother Brenham says eth is not another number he says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 is completion eight is a new day eight is eternity eight is back to the beginning and what happens in this great day of the seventh Feast amen this bride goes back to the Virgin she was at Pentecost it's a it's a return back to the beginning and here he is in the great day the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood up and cried oh my goodness have you heard his voice in the great day of the seventh Fai have you heard it amen in the eighth day amen he says if you heard this amen you you've broke into the eternity you've come into the Eighth Day your soul is raptured in the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood up and cried saying if any man thirst let him come to me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so what is Jesus saying he laying down a prophecy he's showing that if any man come unto me and drink out of his belly shall be what flow rivers of Living Water listen when we look at the the great baptism of the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God coming and moving into man we always look at it at the beginning as receiving receive ye the Holy Ghost he spoke of the Holy Ghost which they should receive for he had not yet been glorified but but when Jesus describes this holy ghost He describes it as a River of Life flowing out from your belly not receiving but flowing amen you have to receive it so it can flow but the purpose was for it to flow rivers of living water coming out of your bellies you're the one now amen to give life you're the one dispersing truth you're the one shedding the light amen this Holy Ghost is not just for you to receive you receive but this Holy Ghost is to flow through you now you drink and then you become a well amen this is what happened to the woman at the well the woman at the well in John chapter 4 she comes to the well carrying her little pot the same well she's come to all of her life and she tells Jesus didn't Jacob our father dig this well she's going back to the traditions of the father she's going back to where her ancestors had dipped for water for Life to Live amen but that water in that little vessel never changed her life cuz now she's stuck in a cycle of adultery that she doesn't have the power power to break and the water in this well is not breaking that amen right going back to the tradition of the father going back to the same old well and dipping her pot in the same old well again and again but one day when she goes back to that same well there's another man another vessel sitting on the well and that man sitting on the well says hey if you would ask me for a drink I would give you Waters that you thirst no more and neither come back here to draw and she says give me those and then she says hey where are you going to get it from the well is deep and you have nothing to draw she didn't realize that sitting on the well was a [Applause] well that she could drink from and what was in him was living water amen the word Living Water of Life and Jesus told her if you drink of this well it'll be inside of you a Fountain of Living Water springing up the amen a fountain friends it's not a stagnant pool it's not something that drops in and disappears but if you drink of this this Same Spirit will start flowing out of you amen Lazarus was resurrected for a purpose for the glory of God so that the son of man can be glorified thereby Jesus told his disciples you wait in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and then you shall be my Witnesses when you drink of this water it'll be in your belly a water a living Water of Life flowing out and they Spilled Out of the upper room and they started gushing water everywhere it wasn't I received I received I received yeah they received but what do you do after you Reed then you give and you give and amen amen let's go to John chapter 4 and just read the end of this story with this woman at the well we know that the woman at the well she wasn't a heathen she was a Samaritan there was questions locked deep inside of her heart and as she's going to this well amen an outcast from society separated from the norm because of her adultery amen she has a question in her heart and as soon as Jesus discerns her life she says I perceive you're a prophet and when she perceives he's a prophet she's got a question for that prophet and that question isn't what's my future hold and how's everything no the question is we've been told that we have to worship this way the Jews say you have to wor the Catholics say this and the Baptists say this and I'm in the Pentecostal church but my Baptist friend says sh what's her question her question is how do I worship God what's the proper way to worship God what does God want in My Worship I'm confused by all of these Traditions amen she wasn't she wasn't a heathen she wasn't a ranked sinner she was trapped in a life of adultery had five husbands the one she's with now is not her own the religion that she is has no power to break it but she's got a desire in her heart to worship God the right way but she has never heard the right way yet but now she comes to the well she meets the well then she drinks from the well because she says he says woman let me tell you something we know what we worship you don't know but neither in Jerusalem in this mountain shall you worship God but the day coming and now is I love that phrase now for me that's present tense truth now is that the father seeketh such to worship Him in spirit and in truth and she says when Messiah comes he'll teach us these things she wasn't a zealot looking for a a king and a a a general to drive out the Romans she was looking for somebody to teach her the way to God Amen the proper way to worship and what God wants and how to please the Lord what did she want the Messiah she wanted the Messiah for the right reasons there was others who wanted the Messiah because they hated the Romans amen she didn't hate the Romans she wanted God Amen so when Messiah comes he'll teach us these things and he said I that speaketh unto thee am he he didn't go around telling anybody who he was they said tell us plainly are you the Christ said I've told you before you didn't believe me why would you believe me now they said who are you and he wouldn't answer their questions he said if you answer mine I'll answer yours and then they were afraid to answer his so he didn't answer he said neither will I answer you theirs but here comes a little woman why brother Braham said there was a predestinated seed down there in Samaria that he needed to go to amen that's why she hungered to worship God that's why she wanted to know the proper way to worship that's what was driving her all along and here she comes and he says Messiah was teaches these things and what does he do he becomes the voice of the resurrection and he gives her a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to her individually I that speaketh unto you am he she drank from that well she received that word let's look at verse 27 and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her the woman then left her water pot this is one of my favorite parts of the scriptures the woman then left her water pot why did she leave her water pot she didn't need it no more because he said if you drink of the water that I'll give you it'll be in you water springing up into ever ever lasting life and the scripture says she left her water pot her Traditions her attempt at religion her trying to follow the tra she left that water pot she didn't need that water pot anymore and the woman left her water pot and went her way into the City and saith unto men saith to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ then they went out of the city and came unto him my goodness listen this woman was just barely making it she was living uh uh spiritually crippled amen but there's a desire in her heart she came to an old traditional well when she came to the traditional well she met the Living Well when she drank from the living well she dropped the pot she ran into the city now she was the well because in her was Water of Life springing up into everlasting life now she goes into the City and she starts to declare the truth of the word amen there's a man told me everything is this not this the C Christ this is the one we've been looking for and this is a woman with a bad reputation this is a woman who cannot go to the well with the other women she has to go alone because she's an outcast in society she comes down into the city now she's got water of living Living Water of eternal life springing up inside of her she's now an artisian well as the prophet would say and she runs into this city this Outcast of society and says come see a man who told me everything that I ever did is not this the Christ and then they followed her they followed her why because she was leading them in the way of life she had the Water of Life she had come in contact with life she had drunk from The Well of life and now she was a fountain of water verse 39 says and many of the Samaritans of the city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all I ever did so when the Samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would t with them and he Abode there two days and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world I think she rolled the stone away so that they could hear for themselves they believed because of her they believed her testimony they believed because they saw a change in her they believed because something had transformed her life they believe because Lazarus was dead but now he's alive but when they come amen it's not just for Lazarus but they're coming in contact with Christ now they're not coming toward the woman the woman's leading them back to the source of life and then they say we don't just believe now just because of what you said but now we believe because we've heard him ourselves what are we here to do we're here to let the water out friends be a well amen if anybody drinks lead them back to the source so that they can drink and become a well amen this is our life this is why we're here amen what is our role in the resurrection to drink become a Fountain of Life to roll the stone away off these denominational Graves so that they can hear the voice of the Resurrection amen what is the voice of the Bride speaking in the end time Revelation chap 17 the spirit I'm sorry 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come what do they say come to come to our church come to our denomination they say come and drink of the Water of Life freely we' discussed this before but when you tell somebody to come it's different than saying go so if I tell you go there I'm not there but if you go there you can find life but if I've already come to the River of Life if I already drunk from the Fountain of Life if I've already connected with the stream of Life coming from the Throne of God I'm now standing in life in the Water of Life by the River of Life and calling out come come brother brandom said the prophet amen the the prophet and the spirit and the bride they'll all be speaking the same thing and what they'll be speaking will have already been said in the word come out from among her my people and be ye separate what are we doing calling out of the graves calling out of denominationalism Rolling Stones away letting people hear the voice of the resurrection and then come where come and drink of the Water of Life freely so that you can become a well of living Living Water springing up into eternal life so that you can go back to your village to your town to your workplace to wherever you are and spray out the water of life this is our role in the resurrection and then when they come out of the graves amen Jesus said loose them loose them this is why we have Fellowship this is why we have Bible studies this is why we get together this is why we have Services amen this is why we constantly come back why so that we can be loosed from the grave clothes so we can be set free so that we can help one another you roll the stone away you loose them from the grave clothes I say God help me I don't know how in myself I can't tell you I can't do a 10-part class on removing grave clothes let's all get together in the fellowship hall now we're going to go through all the tools and all the instruments and there's a 10-step program to removing grap clothes we don't know how to do it we don't have the intelligence to do it but what we have to do is drink of the Water of Life and become a Fountain of Life and say God I'm here use me God I don't know the answer I don't know how to do it I don't know how to roll a stone away Amen brother B said he could have dissolved that stone but he asked those two little women I don't know how they did it I don't know if they got help I don't know if they used levers I don't know if you used crowbar I don't know what they did but he used those two women somehow they had to catch some inspiration some way to roll that stone away and I feel just as inept as those two little women to roll the stone away I don't know what to do all I know to do is proclaim the truth share the truth go as I'm inspired to go witness and testify and say God give me the strength and wisdom to roll Stones off of Graves and then when I see my brothers come to life God equip me use me uh inspire me to remove their grave clothes I don't know how to do it amen and I don't have a textbook on it and I'm not about to write a textbook on it I'm just here to say that's our job amen and if he's given it to us do he's got to give the inspiration behind it to get it done we're dependent on him Lazarus was one whom God helped I believe after the resurrection he was still helping Lazarus how many people came to Lazarus and said I want to hear the story again how many of you have been asked to share your testimony how many you been asked more than once hey man you know why some people are gathering around and saying Lazarus tell me again I want to hear it again it's such a tremendous story it's so marvelous it encourages me so much oh man it makes the gospel so real to me amen it makes the message come alive amen would you tell me Lazarus tell me again how many times had Lazarus had people sit around his table how many times did Martha make another batch of tea what did Lazarus do he testified to the glory of God and his testimony was so the son of man could be glorified why did God save you that's why did he pull you out of a tomb why did he send somebody your way one day to roll a stone off of your grave why did you get a book why did you get a tape why when others heard noise You Heard a Voice why is it when others heard a man from Kentucky in the 50s and 60s preaching you heard Jesus Christ calling your name cuz the spirit saith to him that has ears let him hear amen why did God fill you with the Holy Ghost so you could say I come out of the Grave My Grave clothes have been removed and I now receive no he did it so you could be like that little woman who run back into the City and said come see a man who told me everything come come see a man who explained everything that we misunderstood for 2,000 years come and see come and listen come and hear that we there's confusion on this there's confusion on that come and listen to the one who Explains It All isn't this the Messiah isn't this Christ praise gone Amen brother B said in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says and remember we are now as his bride pregnated with his Spirit the church bearing children he pregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminent is evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but alive forever more this is eternal life and Vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him amen why because all the word is alive in us the word that transforms us the word that brings the word to pass the life that can believe the word of God and see it come to pass why does troubles come our way why did so much happen in our lives why such Darkness why such trial why such a miserable cave why didn't he come and rescue the first time they called because this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God Amen why the Fall In the Garden of Eden why do we have to be born in hybridization why the darkness of denominationalism why did he let the Catholic church start why did they start to to eat down the the bride tree why did it go into the Dark Ages why 30,000 denominations why did he allow it this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the son of man might be glorified why was I born into this family why was I born into this condition why was I trapped in this listen this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the son of man might be glorified thereby let your testimony glorify God Amen again in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says oh the devil is howling about this the Manifest the truth of the promise of the word in her alone they don't have the answer when Jesus come why didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by see he stood alone in his church stands alone she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body and the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by him that's why the devil is howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen do you believe that she is now risen and by the power of the Vindicated word promised to her amen don't never shut her up she'll be taken up I don't think they ever shut Lazarus up I don't think they ever shut that little woman that was at the well that little Samar I don't think they could ever shut her up and I don't want them ever to shut me up CU there was a man who told me everything that I've ever done and explained to me all the confusion in my life I listened to anointed ones at the end time and absolutely unraveled the mystery of my childhood growing up in the Pentecostal Church what was that that was Christ that man from Kentucky didn't know those things they were revealed by Christ they were sent down for us through a prophet but they were sent to us to unravel the mystery amen and I can say come see a man who told me everything that I've ever done and all that I've ever been through and all the confusion I've been in and who called me by his voice out of the grave and who sent his servants to me to unwrap the grave clothes from around me come and see that manen come and taste and see that the Lord is good Jesus says to his disciples in Matthew 10 verse 40 he that believeth you that he that receiveth you receiveth me amen and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me amen you're the tool in his hand this Resurrection is for a reason and we're here for a reason so God help me I don't know you know sometimes I I tell you friends when I travel sometimes I sit in an airport I'll sit in an international airport somewhere Atlanta or sometimes in Paris or sometimes in uh Amsterdam huge airports and planes you watch the board planes coming from everywhere around the world Landing every few minutes they're coming from Asia they're coming from Africa they're coming from America they're coming from Mexico they're coming all over and you see people passing through the corridors as they go from one plane to the next as they travel and when I'm in those airports sometimes I'm absolutely overwhelmed by the abundance of people and how few the bride is and sometimes I sit there and I watch the people crisscross the corridors coming to and fro over the Earth and I said God God how will it's like a needle in a hay stack how do you find the seed of God in this and that airport is just a small representation of the whole world God how and sometimes I'm absolutely overwhelmed if it was my effort I would fail there's no possible way but I thank God he knew how to find me the needle in the Hy stack he knew how to find you amen and we've come from all kinds of different places we've come out of all kinds of different churches in all kinds of different situations and and he knew how to come to that one and he knew where that one was he knew where the woman at the well was and when she would come for water he knew how to bump into you he knew where your grave was and he knew what your name was how does he do it I don't know can I do it absolutely not but I'm the instrument in his hand and I say God if you need somebody to roll a stone away I'm giving you these two hands I'm giving you this mouth I'm giving you this body I don't know where it is and I don't know how to do it but God if you'll equip me I will give all my heart to roll the stone away I will help my brother get unwrapped from his grave clothes but God you've got to come and help me and I want there to be lazarus' all over the world where people will come and they'll believe because of Lazarus testimony and then they'll meet Christ I want all kinds of woman that the well that'll drink from the fountain and go and tell others come see a man amen and they'll say now we believe not just because of your word but because we've heard him ourself what's our role in the resurrection I think we got a lot of work to do I think there's a lot of work for us to do but I think the spirit of God is present to give us the ability to do the work and I'm relying on him but I want to be awake I want to be tuned in and I want to be available are you with me amen CU this is our role in the resurrection let's all Stand Together amen as we end one year and look at the next year listen friends I think we got a lot of work cut out for us I think there's a lot of people stuck behind gravestones rocks that are rolled over tombes I believe there's a lot of people trapped in systems and going back to Old Wells trying to find enough water to survive for another day I believe there's more there there may not be the last one may have already come in the door may be shut and we're we're exiting but I just don't know but I believe there's more to come in we've seen God draw he draws from wherever he wants to draw he pulls people in and brings them to the truth I say praise be to God the voice of the Resurrection is still going on and I want to be a partner in the Resurrection season amen I don't want to be a bystander I don't want to be somebody who just talks about what I want to be a partner of his in the Resurrection season if I can do that through sharing my testimony if I can do that through a witness if I can do that through the life that I live however God wants to use this vessel I want to be available to be used and that's why I want to start 2024 I know God doesn't count time like man counts time God has a different calendar alog together but for us these are transition times and in transition time I want God to be the central focus of every transition so I don't miss what he wants me to do time is winding down it's winding to the Finish I say God help us finish strong help us call out that last predestinated seed oh thank God you know what he's kept us friends he's done more than kept us he's called us he's given us life he's equipped us he's revealed himself to us he said I come that you might have life and you might have it more abundantly whatever life I had before this is more abundant amen amen I thank God for that amen musicians if you'd come amen let's bow and pray Lord Jesus we thank you God we thank you God that you are the voice of the Resurrection as your Prophet declared what a resurrection this is God we've we've experienced it you've caught us up out of the world and the world Traditions out of leoan leoan thinking Lord I pray that you would just continue to strip all the grave clothes off of us separate us Lord from all of our Traditions everything that man tried to wrap around us Lord to inhibit us to keep us in the grave I pray Lord that you'd strip it all away use your servants Lord use use your body to minister to the body to strip away those grave clothes take them from me if there's any fragments or remnants of old grave clothes left on me from denominational years I pray you remove them from me now Lord God I want to go forth and declare your name I want to declare your glory as Lazarus did Lord I want that to be my testimony and I want my testimony to have an effect on people God I want to have a testimony like the little Samaritan woman Lord that that testimony will have an effect on people use us oh God I believe Lord we're in the Resurrection season and the Resurrection season Lord is transpiring as it calls your bride out of the deadness of denominations out of the darkness Lord of man's ideas and brings us Lord into the fullness of the word and God when that is completed that Resurrection will take on physical manifestation as it brings the sleeping Saints out of the ground God in this season help us Lord to do our part God we need your help Lord we need your wisdom we need your understanding we need your leadership Lord now sometimes we don't know where to put our foot next to step to the right or to the left or where to go but God I pray that you'd come and by your grace would you lead us as a great Shepherd step by step help us not to get to the right or to the left but Lord let us stay in the very center of your will for Our Lives May may you help us God your Prophet told us that you do nothing without man but you partner with man to spread the gospel Lord I want to surrender to be your partner I want this Tabernacle of Flesh to be your tool that you can take in your hand and use for your glory god without you we can do nothing but with you all things are possible I pray God that you would use us father For Your Glory as we transition into another year may this be a tremendous year Lord where many come out of the Grave may your light shine like it's never shined before May It Shine through our lives as we surrender more to your hand as we die more to ourselves and we become more free as a people in your word May the light shine brighter than it's ever shined before God May others find their way to you and not just believe because of our word but believe because they hear you themselves may you cry out Lord and call your bride from the grave we love you father and we ask that you would help us that you would bless us Lord as we break from this service and go Lord I pray you watch over each one Lord protect them and keep them as we come back this evening I pray you would meet us here once again Lord and Shepherd over us and guide us and lead us and instruct Us For Your Glory for God we are your people Lord declaring your word your bride upon the Earth that you want to manifest yourself through God it's going to take a shaving down and a dying out Lord and I want to be shaved down and I want to die out because that's the only purpose that I want to live for help us gone as we surrender to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray
