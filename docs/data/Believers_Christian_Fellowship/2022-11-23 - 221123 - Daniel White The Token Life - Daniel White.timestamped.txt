[9:50] good to be back together again
[9:52] we got a little surprise and that
[9:54] brother Daniel's going to take the
[9:56] service take one more service for us
[9:58] that wasn't originally the plan I wanted
[10:01] to be a a good brother and a good friend
[10:04] and share brother Daniel with another
[10:05] assembly in the area and as I called
[10:08] around because it's Thanksgiving weekend
[10:10] or Thanksgiving week Services were
[10:13] canceled other arrangements were made
[10:14] pastors were on vacation it didn't work
[10:17] so I decided to be nice and give our
[10:19] brother a break
[10:21] I was going to take the service I was
[10:23] going to let him rest
[10:24] but then after he preached Saturday
[10:26] night I thought I cannot let that
[10:27] brother
[10:28] sit in the congregation so I didn't say
[10:31] anything to him until just yesterday and
[10:34] I asked and he graciously accepted and
[10:36] was willing to come and I just I just so
[10:40] appreciated the way God has used him
[10:42] the word that the Lord has brought
[10:44] through that vessel has really blessed
[10:46] me and I just am thankful that he was
[10:49] willing to take another service and I
[10:51] know it'll be a blessing to you so we're

[15:17] that he places within his body
[15:20] and may you continue just to encourage
[15:23] one another and and be encouraged by one
[15:26] another
[15:27] and truly appreciate brother Chad
[15:30] and his love and generosity to us
[15:34] we um you know we
[15:37] it's so much so that we feel a little
[15:39] bit awkward in in the amount of things
[15:42] that he's laid on us you know
[15:44] but uh nevertheless we'll take it so
[15:48] thank you all amen amen Let's uh turn in
[15:51] our Bibles and light to the the book of
[15:54] Jude I'd like to read from from three
[15:56] places
[15:57] and I just like to spend a little bit of
[16:00] time here tonight on speaking about the
[16:03] the token
[16:05] life
[16:06] the token life I I haven't
[16:08] um
[16:10] ministered this thought anywhere before
[16:12] so just the Lord just started dealing
[16:14] with
[16:15] uh me with it today and I just want to
[16:18] allow the Lord to have Liberty and may
[16:22] He bring to you tonight what you have
[16:25] need of
[16:26] and uh the the wonderful thing about the
[16:29] Lord is that we may not all have the
[16:31] same need but he has the unique ability
[16:34] that he can meet more than one need at
[16:37] once
[16:38] I struggle to meet my wife and my
[16:41] daughter's need at the same time but God
[16:44] can meet a hundred people's needs in one
[16:46] time and then that's that's the God we
[16:49] serve so we uh we are thankful that we
[16:53] are not real you're not relying on me I
[16:55] hope you're thankful for that
[16:57] because I'd have to deal with you one at
[16:59] a time and perhaps I'd be able to meet
[17:01] some people's needs and not others but
[17:04] the Lord in which we believe is present
[17:07] here tonight he is able to meet each and
[17:09] every need
[17:11] amen every need that's here tonight he's
[17:13] able to meet it tonight so we want to
[17:16] thank him for this opportunity
[17:19] that he has given us
[17:21] to understand that we are in his
[17:24] presence
[17:25] amen and I don't know your need but he
[17:28] knows your need I don't even need to
[17:30] know your need he knows your need all
[17:34] I've got to do is surrender to the one
[17:35] that knows your need and then he can
[17:38] meet your need
[17:39] so I I trust that I would find Grace in
[17:43] God's sight
[17:44] tonight just to once again allow him to
[17:48] minister through this vessel of clay
[17:50] and uh meet each and every need
[17:53] I just want to read a portion of Jude um
[17:56] chapter 1 verse 14 just a part of that
[17:59] verse there
[18:01] it says and Enoch also the seventh
[18:05] from Adam
[18:07] that's all we're going to read from that
[18:09] we just want to
[18:10] take the the point here the scripture is
[18:14] telling us that Enoch was the seventh
[18:16] from Adam if we can go to the Book of
[18:19] Genesis
[18:20] Genesis chapter 5.
[18:26] told by the Franco last service you know
[18:29] once a man
[18:31] um gets his microphone in place without
[18:35] needing help it's time to go home
[18:38] well tonight he didn't even check
[18:41] so I think it's time to go home
[18:44] Genesis chapter 5 verse 21
[18:49] and Enoch lived 60 and five years and we
[18:53] got begat Methuselah
[18:55] and Enoch walked with God after he
[18:57] begapped Methuselah 300 years
[19:01] and begat sons and daughters
[19:05] and all the days of Enoch were 365 years
[19:10] and Enoch walked with God
[19:13] and was not
[19:15] for God took him
[19:18] if we can go to the book of Hebrew
[19:20] Hebrews as well
[19:23] Hebrews chapter 11.
[19:28] verses 5 and 6.
[19:34] you understand that this is the by faith
[19:37] chapter Hebrews 11.
[19:39] verse 5.
[19:42] by faith Enoch was translated
[19:47] that he should not see death
[19:50] and was not found because God had
[19:53] translated him
[19:56] for before his testimony for sorry
[20:00] before his translation he had this
[20:03] testimony that he pleased God
[20:08] but without faith it is impossible to
[20:11] please him
[20:12] for he that cometh to God must believe
[20:16] that he is
[20:19] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[20:23] diligently seek him
[20:26] amen our heavenly father we bow our
[20:28] hearts before you this evening Lord God
[20:30] we
[20:31] we understand Lord Jesus that you know
[20:34] our our desires you know our needs
[20:38] Lord God we pray Heavenly Father by your
[20:41] grace that you would just meet each and
[20:43] every need in this building tonight
[20:46] may we leave this place Lord not the
[20:49] same as what we came in but may we
[20:51] leaving courage Lord may we leave
[20:53] strengthened through the ministry of
[20:55] your word we pray
[20:57] in Jesus Christ's precious name
[20:59] amen amen you may take your seats
[21:03] tonight
[21:05] so I don't want to spend too much time
[21:09] looking at this thought here in the book
[21:11] of Jude but
[21:13] just to get a bit of context a bit of
[21:15] depth to what we are speaking on tonight
[21:18] we understand that Enoch was the seventh
[21:21] from Adam and we understand that out of
[21:24] the seventh Church age by the voice of
[21:27] the seventh angel
[21:29] that there was a bride that was going to
[21:31] be that was going to come forth as a
[21:34] result
[21:35] of that seventh Angel's message
[21:39] we understand that Enoch is is our type
[21:43] and Enoch
[21:45] was translated and to put that into our
[21:48] terms today Enoch was raptured
[21:51] so we understand that Enoch had a
[21:55] rapturing faith
[21:57] so Enoch being our type we understand
[22:00] that we feel within ourselves that the
[22:05] the body changes is almost upon us
[22:10] we we understand that the the Rapture is
[22:13] a process but we un but just to allow me
[22:17] to say it this way we understand that
[22:19] the Rapture is is just around the corner
[22:22] the conclusion of it all is just around
[22:25] the corner we understand that in order
[22:27] for us to be raptured we must have what
[22:31] Enoch had
[22:32] and that is a rapturing faith amen and
[22:36] we understand that that rapturing Faith
[22:38] was going to come from the word of God
[22:41] in which we have received it cannot come
[22:43] from anywhere else our faith is in God's
[22:46] word
[22:47] amen so we
[22:50] we understand our type we understand
[22:53] what we have need of we understand that
[22:56] in any time there that there will be a
[23:00] people who will not see death
[23:03] but there will be a people who will be
[23:06] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[23:07] of an eye and we will receive our body
[23:10] change
[23:12] um as a result of our faith in which God
[23:15] is giving to us
[23:17] we see here What God Says
[23:21] um about Enoch he's the scripture here
[23:24] gives a testimony
[23:26] of Enoch and Enoch's testimony was as
[23:31] simple as that Enoch walked with God
[23:36] amen so it's it's a very simple
[23:39] testimony that God has
[23:42] recorded within his word that simply
[23:46] Enoch walked with God
[23:49] until he walked home
[23:52] he he walked home
[23:54] you know so we understand that this is
[23:57] also
[23:59] um what our testimony is going to be but
[24:02] it amazes me at the simplicity
[24:06] of Enoch's testimony
[24:09] the in in Hebrews chapter 11. it it
[24:13] doesn't say
[24:15] um
[24:16] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[24:20] should see that he should not see death
[24:24] but and was not found because God had
[24:28] translated him
[24:30] for or because he built the pyramids
[24:35] you know the Simplicity of Enoch's
[24:39] testimony is something that we can all
[24:42] relate to
[24:44] because if it had a sin if God had said
[24:47] because Enoch built the pyramids Enoch
[24:50] was translated Well we'd all be building
[24:52] our own pyramid yes so God God gave
[24:56] Enoch such a simple testimony and yet
[25:00] Enoch did Mighty things I mean he was
[25:03] the one who built the pyramids and yet
[25:05] God doesn't actually record that what
[25:08] God recorded was that that Enoch walked
[25:12] with God and was not
[25:14] so he walked by faith so this Enoch's
[25:18] walk really pleased God
[25:20] all right and it wasn't that it got uh
[25:24] Enoch pleased God because he built the
[25:26] pyramids but Enoch pleased God because
[25:29] Enoch walked with God
[25:31] all right Enoch walked with the
[25:34] Supernatural and I'm going to use that
[25:36] word a little bit tonight the
[25:38] supernatural because I believe it's
[25:40] important because the token life is a
[25:43] supernatural life
[25:44] so Enoch walked with God and God was the
[25:48] supernatural element in Enoch's life
[25:51] all right so Enoch walked with the
[25:54] supernatural we understand that Enoch
[25:57] did not always walk with God that the
[26:00] scripture says that that Enoch walked
[26:04] with God after he begat Methuselah all
[26:08] right so there was a period of time that
[26:10] Enoch did not walk with God but when he
[26:14] did walk with God it pleased God to walk
[26:17] with Enoch
[26:19] amen it pleased God to walk with Enoch
[26:23] it says that Enoch walked with God but
[26:26] you you've got to understand that if I
[26:29] walk with my wife my wife is also
[26:31] walking with me
[26:33] so we can flip this over and say that it
[26:36] pleased Enoch to walk with God but it
[26:38] pleased God to walk with Enoch amen and
[26:41] I believe at this time that through a
[26:44] relationship that God has formed with
[26:46] you as his elected lady that it pleases
[26:50] him to walk with you
[26:53] amen it pleases him to walk he takes he
[26:56] takes pride in Walking With You amen and
[27:00] I find great comfort in him walking with
[27:04] me it pleases me to be able to walk with
[27:08] him so there was a portion of Enoch's
[27:11] life where he did not walk with God and
[27:15] Enoch was our type so we understand that
[27:19] there is a portion of our life in which
[27:21] we did not walk with God but at an
[27:24] appointed time God desires to walk with
[27:28] you we understand we've been looking at
[27:30] Abraham or Abram as it were in the
[27:34] beginning it God desired to walk with
[27:37] Abram
[27:38] amen and God desires to walk with each
[27:43] one of us
[27:44] and God desired to walk with Enoch and I
[27:49] think you might say Enoch a little bit
[27:50] different to that but that's how we say
[27:52] it but
[27:54] God's desire was to walk with Enoch
[27:57] God's desire is to walk with you his end
[28:01] time bride
[28:02] and through that relationship
[28:06] we are simply going to walk from here
[28:12] amen it's not something that God
[28:16] desires to do and then he leaves us
[28:21] and say well good luck to you I hope to
[28:24] see you after the body change you know
[28:27] he's here with us
[28:29] how can we walk with God and God not be
[28:32] here
[28:33] because this is our type
[28:36] a man Enoch is our type how could Enoch
[28:40] walk with God if God wasn't with him
[28:43] God was with him therefore Enoch could
[28:47] walk with God
[28:48] amen and this this end time bride you as
[28:52] that end time bride as an individual the
[28:55] reason that you can walk with him is
[28:58] because he is here
[29:01] amen because he is here we can walk with
[29:06] him
[29:08] I believe that where God placed the
[29:13] focus in Enoch's testimony is the place
[29:17] that he wants us to focus today
[29:23] the focus is that Enoch walked with God
[29:29] this is the focal point
[29:31] of the testimony
[29:33] Enoch walked with God and was not
[29:38] all right so the focal point was not the
[29:42] pyramid
[29:43] or the things that God had done through
[29:46] Enoch
[29:48] but it was the walk
[29:50] that Enoch had with God that God focuses
[29:55] in on in his life
[29:58] of all the things that God could have
[30:01] focused in on God focused in on Enoch's
[30:05] walk with him it pleased God
[30:09] that Enoch walked with him amen I
[30:14] believe that's where God wants us to
[30:16] focus on tonight
[30:17] or in our lives is the focal point is
[30:21] the fact that God is walking with us
[30:25] amen the token life is with us we are
[30:30] walking with that Supernatural element
[30:32] of God
[30:34] amen
[30:38] if we understand who we're walking with
[30:43] then we have nothing to fear
[30:48] you think about this in a father-son
[30:51] relationship you know when your children
[30:53] are are little you know the son holds
[30:56] the father's hand
[30:58] and he ain't afraid of anything
[31:01] because he he has that childlike faith
[31:05] and he has confidence in who he is
[31:09] walking with
[31:10] it doesn't matter where where they walk
[31:13] it doesn't matter what things surround
[31:16] them when they're walking there's
[31:18] complete faith that child has complete
[31:23] faith in his father's ability to lead
[31:27] him through whatever he is being led
[31:31] through
[31:33] that son relies upon the strength of his
[31:36] father
[31:38] to get him or carry him through
[31:41] he relies upon the vision of his father
[31:46] because the son may not know where he's
[31:49] going but really he doesn't need to know
[31:52] where he's going because he's not
[31:55] walking alone there's someone greater
[31:58] than him there
[32:00] amen and to a son that is the
[32:04] supernatural
[32:05] the dad will fix it Dad can do it as
[32:09] long as I'm with Dad I have no fear I I
[32:12] don't need to worry about anything I'm
[32:15] relying on his vision to get me through
[32:19] I'm relying on his strength to get me
[32:22] through I'm I'm resting in his ability
[32:25] to get me through I think this is a
[32:28] wonderful thing because we know portions
[32:31] of uh we we know portions of our walk
[32:34] but there's parts of our walk we don't
[32:36] know
[32:37] but we don't need to worry about the
[32:40] parts that we don't know if we know who
[32:43] we're walking with
[32:44] amen because God is not a hiling
[32:50] when Trouble Comes he doesn't run
[32:54] when Trouble Comes I run and his hand
[32:57] gets stretched he says now stay here
[33:00] stay with me it's okay and he reminds me
[33:03] of who I'm with and so God is not a
[33:06] hiring God is not someone who leaves us
[33:08] when trouble strikes but God is someone
[33:11] who protects us he guides us he brings
[33:14] his vision to pass for us as we walk
[33:19] with him
[33:21] so this is what I believe God is wanting
[33:23] us to see in the testimony of Enoch
[33:27] there is no doubt that the pyramid was
[33:29] was a great thing to this day they don't
[33:33] fully understand how these pyramids were
[33:37] built
[33:38] so we can understand that there was a
[33:40] there was a supernatural element to what
[33:43] Enoch did
[33:45] all right and that Supernatural element
[33:47] to this day is still not understood by
[33:51] mankind
[33:52] and there's that Supernatural element is
[33:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[33:57] that Supernatural element is here still
[34:00] tonight
[34:02] and we may not realize it but people are
[34:05] not gonna understand the supernatural
[34:08] element that is here today as much as
[34:11] they did not understand the supernatural
[34:13] element in that pyramid
[34:15] amen they're not they're not going to
[34:17] understand it we'll get to that a little
[34:19] bit a little bit later on because what I
[34:21] want to where we are going with this
[34:24] tonight is what does it mean to apply
[34:27] the token
[34:29] that's where we're going with this Okay
[34:32] so
[34:35] we want to put the focus
[34:38] where God puts the focus
[34:41] God put the focus in Enoch's testimony
[34:45] on the walk
[34:49] not was not what was produced but on the
[34:53] walk
[34:55] all right because it because the wolf
[34:57] who was walking with Enoch the walk that
[35:00] your walk is the most important part of
[35:02] your life
[35:04] your walk with the Lord is the most
[35:06] important part of your life
[35:09] all right what is produced as a result
[35:12] of that walk is another thing altogether
[35:16] but the important thing is the walk your
[35:20] walk with him all right now I believe
[35:23] that Enoch knew who was walking with him
[35:26] I believe Enoch knew this
[35:29] he he knew who was walking with him he
[35:34] knew the supernatural one was with him
[35:38] what would it be like if Enoch's
[35:41] testimony read like this
[35:43] and Enoch built the Great Pyramid
[35:47] but knew not God was with him
[35:53] that would be a sad testimony
[35:55] right because again even on the negative
[35:58] the focal point is the walk
[36:02] you know if and Enoch built the Great
[36:05] Pyramid but knew not that God was with
[36:08] him
[36:09] that's a sad testimony all right because
[36:12] you've missed Enoch missed the focal
[36:15] point
[36:16] and the focal point was not the pyramid
[36:20] all right it's like a church the focal
[36:22] point is not the church
[36:24] all right the focal point is not your
[36:27] home
[36:28] the focal point you can you can live
[36:30] under a a piece of iron
[36:34] and it not matter
[36:36] if your focal point is in the correct
[36:40] thing and that is
[36:43] I walk with God but I live under a sheet
[36:46] of iron it makes that difference to me
[36:49] what I live under as long as I'm walking
[36:51] with God amen so the we we we thank God
[36:57] that Enoch's testimony is not like that
[37:00] because Enoch is our type
[37:02] amen so it means that the bride's focal
[37:05] point
[37:06] is on the walk this is where our focal
[37:09] point is going to be and I believe if
[37:11] you would uh if you were to ask Enoch
[37:14] when you when we get to that place where
[37:16] we can talk with Enoch you say Enoch how
[37:19] did you get here well he's going to say
[37:21] I walked with God
[37:24] he's not going to say I built a pyramid
[37:27] he's going to say I walked with God
[37:30] all right and I believe that this bride
[37:32] is going to have the same testimony that
[37:35] what Enoch did and she's not going to
[37:38] say well I did this and I did that and I
[37:40] did this and I did that she's just going
[37:42] to say I walked with God and the only
[37:45] reason that I could walk with God is
[37:47] because God decided to walk with me
[37:50] amen we love God because he first loved
[37:53] us we walk with God because he first
[37:55] walked with me
[37:57] amen so the only reason that I can do
[38:00] what I'm doing Walking with God is
[38:02] because he chose to walk with me
[38:05] all right man can tend to put the focus
[38:09] on what is produced but God puts the
[38:13] focus on who produced it
[38:17] there's there's no point in experiencing
[38:20] the supernatural if we don't see the
[38:23] supernatural one who produced the
[38:26] supernatural
[38:28] I meant the whole purpose of the
[38:30] Supernatural is that you might
[38:32] understand and that the supernatural one
[38:34] is here
[38:36] amen and he is
[38:38] the supernatural one is here you're
[38:40] looking at natural I'm looking at
[38:42] natural but I believe by faith that the
[38:47] supernatural one is here tonight amen
[38:51] the supernatural one is the token life
[38:56] the life of the token is a supernatural
[38:59] life
[39:00] okay the supernatural life the prophet
[39:03] of God says in the token
[39:06] he says Israel's Lamb slain was the
[39:09] requirement of Jehovah to escape death
[39:12] there must be a substitute death and
[39:16] Jehovah required the slain lamb and the
[39:20] blood was a token that the requirement
[39:24] had been made
[39:26] now the blood was a sign that something
[39:29] had died
[39:30] and the blood itself was the token
[39:34] it was saying that this house has met
[39:39] the requirement requirements of
[39:41] Jehovah's word and therefore it is
[39:45] protected by this token that our Fair
[39:50] has been paid what a beautiful type here
[39:54] Christ is to this what a type of our
[39:59] token today
[40:01] so we understand that the prophet he was
[40:03] speaking about Israel that when they
[40:07] were in Egypt Egypt and it was a time
[40:10] when the death angel was passing through
[40:12] the land but God gave them a token which
[40:16] was the blood of a natural lamb that was
[40:20] applied to the doorpost and lintel
[40:23] okay it was applied to the doorpost and
[40:27] lentil and once it was applied there was
[40:30] a life that could be lived after the
[40:34] application of the token that could not
[40:38] be lived before the application of the
[40:41] token
[40:42] all right so there was a time when Enoch
[40:45] walked without God but then there become
[40:48] a time when Enoch walked with God
[40:51] there was a life that was Enoch was able
[40:54] to live without with God that he could
[40:57] not live when he was not walking with
[41:00] God
[41:01] there was a life that was able to be
[41:03] lived in Israel in those humble homes in
[41:07] when Israel was stuck in Egypt that was
[41:10] able to be lived as a result of the
[41:13] application of the token that God had
[41:17] given them
[41:18] God had given them the token but the
[41:21] token had to be applied
[41:24] once the token had been applied they
[41:28] could live a life now that they couldn't
[41:31] live before
[41:33] because before they lived in fear
[41:37] but the death the the the token
[41:41] bought or eradicated fear
[41:44] once the token was applied fear was gone
[41:49] I meant so Israel needed a token
[41:53] it was God's requirement and God meets
[41:56] his own requirements
[41:59] amen we understand that this is not
[42:01] something that Israel could produce for
[42:04] themselves it had to be something that
[42:07] God revealed it had to be something that
[42:10] God provided it had to be a token that
[42:15] he provided for them and revealed it
[42:18] through that Prophet Moses
[42:20] amen so once the token was revealed then
[42:25] the token had to be applied and then
[42:29] there was a life that could be lived as
[42:32] a result of the token being applied that
[42:36] could not be lived without the token
[42:39] because Israel if the token wasn't
[42:42] applied Israel was going to come under
[42:46] the same curse that Egypt was the only
[42:50] protection was the application of the
[42:53] revealed token oh it's beautiful the
[42:57] only the only protection they had was
[43:01] the application of the revealed token to
[43:04] their home amen the father had to apply
[43:08] the token to the doorpost in Lino it
[43:11] could not be applied to wherever he
[43:14] thought it would look good or wherever
[43:16] he thought it would work it had to be
[43:19] applied to the right place
[43:22] amen so we we we thank God that he has
[43:27] given us a token
[43:29] [Music]
[43:30] the token has a supernatural element
[43:35] meaning that while the death angel had
[43:40] access to every house
[43:43] where that token was not applied
[43:46] the death angel could not gain access
[43:49] to the home that the token was applied
[43:53] amen so that token had a it looked
[43:56] natural
[43:58] but it had a supernatural element
[44:01] the Scarlet thread looked natural
[44:05] but there was a supernatural element
[44:08] to the token
[44:10] amen
[44:12] The Profit goes on here
[44:15] now we have a token in this day
[44:18] we've been given a token which is the
[44:21] any type of that token
[44:24] of that natural token with being given
[44:27] the supernatural
[44:30] Supreme token
[44:33] amen the supernatural Supreme
[44:37] token
[44:39] all that
[44:42] all that that foreshadowed has been
[44:45] given to this generation
[44:48] has been has been given the token
[44:51] now we have the Holy Ghost is our token
[44:55] and it is our identification that we
[44:59] have accepted the death of the Lamb Not
[45:02] only was Jesus just a human life to come
[45:08] back on us but it was God himself
[45:12] manifested in flesh
[45:15] amen so we see here that there was a
[45:18] supernatural element to Jesus
[45:22] amen his life was the was the token
[45:26] amen there's a supernatural element just
[45:28] like it looked natural
[45:31] but it was more than natural it was
[45:34] Supernatural
[45:35] all right the Scarlet thread that was
[45:37] revealed to a Rahab it looked natural
[45:41] but there was a supernatural element
[45:44] all right Jesus looked like any other
[45:46] man
[45:47] he looked like you
[45:49] he looked like human as he looked like
[45:52] Peter if Peter stubbed his toe and and
[45:55] Peter's toe bled well if Jesus stopped
[45:59] his toe Jesus told bled
[46:01] if Peter got weary Jesus got weary Peter
[46:05] got headaches Jesus got headaches all
[46:08] right so there was a there was a it
[46:10] looked natural but it wasn't
[46:14] and that Supernatural element to him is
[46:18] still not understood today
[46:21] but it is understood by some
[46:24] amen but it's not understood by others
[46:28] all right so
[46:30] let me finish this quotation but it was
[46:33] God himself
[46:35] manifested in flesh
[46:38] that brought back upon us
[46:41] the adoption of sons that now we are
[46:45] Sons and Daughters of God that is the
[46:48] token it's our identification the
[46:52] Passover it's our identification that we
[46:56] have believed God and God has accepted
[47:04] so we see here that the Holy Ghost
[47:07] is our token
[47:09] it's the supernatural Supreme token
[47:13] which is the life of God in The Believer
[47:18] all right the token allows us
[47:21] to live a supernatural life
[47:27] and the more we surrender
[47:31] the more the supernatural can flow from
[47:35] us
[47:37] the more I Surrender
[47:40] the more of the supernatural that
[47:44] Supernatural life can express himself
[47:49] because as we saw over the last Services
[47:51] God can only express himself to the
[47:54] level that you surrender
[47:56] amen so you surrender yourself to the
[48:00] level that you surrender yourself to the
[48:02] supernatural one is the level that the
[48:06] supernatural one can express himself
[48:10] through him we do not need to fear
[48:16] the death angel is moving in the land
[48:21] but we do not need to fear
[48:25] because there is a supernatural element
[48:28] to you as an individual
[48:32] the supernatural element to you is not
[48:35] because you attend Living Word
[48:36] Fellowship in Australia
[48:39] but the supernatural element to you is
[48:42] because you have received the baptism of
[48:45] the Holy Ghost in your life who has
[48:47] sealed you until the day of your
[48:49] Redemption
[48:50] amen he is the supernatural element in
[48:54] your life
[48:56] every demon
[48:59] I was going to say in hell but brother
[49:01] Les was saying that the on the weekend
[49:03] that the the um there's no demons in
[49:06] Hell anymore they're all on Earth
[49:10] every demon from hell
[49:15] is against you
[49:17] amen
[49:19] but you do not need to fear
[49:24] you do not need to know the name of
[49:27] every demon
[49:30] because that's not my focus my focus is
[49:34] on who are you walking with
[49:37] who is walking with me
[49:41] amen under that token I do not need to
[49:44] worry about my children
[49:48] all right when when the fathers in the
[49:51] of of Israel when they were in Egypt
[49:54] when they applied that token they did
[49:57] not need to worry about their children
[50:00] the children were as secure as they were
[50:05] right because that the the the the the
[50:08] the token that was applied was applied
[50:11] to the house it was applied to their
[50:14] children also
[50:16] okay so they didn't need to worry about
[50:19] their children because the token in my
[50:23] in my life is applied to their life
[50:26] and we understand there's a time in in
[50:30] adolescence when children take
[50:32] responsibility for their own lives and
[50:35] they need the revelation of the token
[50:37] themselves and apply it to their own
[50:40] lives but as I'm talking about young
[50:42] young children
[50:44] I don't need to worry about you don't
[50:46] need to worry about your children if you
[50:48] have young children
[50:50] if the token is applied to your life
[50:53] then you don't need to worry about the
[50:56] demons around that want possession of
[51:00] your children because the token has been
[51:02] applied to your life
[51:04] amen the the father brother Brown
[51:07] dramatizes this you know in in when the
[51:10] token was applied in Egypt to the to
[51:12] Israel homes you know the sun would walk
[51:15] up to the father and say Daddy are you
[51:17] sure
[51:19] and and brother Brown said he'd pull his
[51:21] glasses down and put him on the end of
[51:22] his nose and and and dropped the
[51:24] newspaper down and said son I am
[51:27] certainly sure you have nothing to fear
[51:31] the token has been applied
[51:34] amen so there's a supernatural element
[51:36] that that is involved in family life
[51:40] there's a supernatural element that was
[51:43] involved in that father's life and there
[51:45] was a supernatural element that was
[51:47] involved in his in his wife's life and
[51:49] there was a supernatural element that
[51:51] was also involved in his children's life
[51:55] amen so what the token was was a
[52:00] security it was it was it was perfect
[52:03] love it was something that cast out fear
[52:06] I don't need to fear anymore why because
[52:09] perfect love the Holy Ghost it's it's
[52:11] here it's been applied to my life I
[52:14] don't need to worry I don't need to fear
[52:17] greater is the token than he that is in
[52:20] the world
[52:21] amen greater is he that is in you than
[52:24] he that is in the world greater is the
[52:26] token that that is that has sealed you
[52:29] until the day of your Redemption than he
[52:31] that is in the world
[52:33] amen so we we thank God for the token
[52:40] the token
[52:43] must be applied
[52:48] if the token is not applied
[52:52] then it's of no benefit
[52:55] the token must be applied
[52:59] the Lord said to Israel he said when I
[53:02] see the blood the token
[53:05] I will pass over you
[53:08] amen so the token had to be applied and
[53:11] the prophet of God picks this up in the
[53:13] token he says the blood was a token or
[53:17] an identification identifying
[53:21] this people has been redeemed
[53:25] now we'll notice they had they they were
[53:28] redeemed before there was anything had
[53:31] happened
[53:32] by faith they applied the blood see
[53:35] before it actually happened the blood
[53:39] was applied by faith
[53:41] believing that it was going to happen
[53:45] see before the wrath of God passed
[53:49] through the land the blood had to be
[53:51] applied first it was too late after
[53:57] the Roth had for the Roth had done
[54:01] fallen so the prophet's making a point
[54:04] here that the blood has to be applied
[54:07] before the wrath of God falls on the
[54:09] Earth
[54:10] amen if the token is not applied before
[54:13] that then it has no effect on your life
[54:16] amen when he come when he becomes both
[54:21] judge jury and attorney he pleaded our
[54:25] case
[54:27] we
[54:29] found guilty by his own law
[54:33] and he come and took the guilty person's
[54:38] place
[54:39] that was in the sanctuary he took his
[54:43] sin he took it upon himself and died and
[54:48] paid the price and shed his blood and
[54:53] give back his own token his own life
[55:00] why we are perfectly the case is
[55:04] dismissed
[55:05] there is no more sin to the believer
[55:09] oh God have mercy if the people can't
[55:14] see that
[55:15] that there is no more case
[55:19] he has he that heareth my words and
[55:23] believeth on me that sent me has eternal
[55:26] life and shall not come to the Judgment
[55:29] that has passed from Death unto life
[55:32] there is the case case dismissed
[55:38] no more case to it amen then safety
[55:43] safely safely with the token applied
[55:47] When Death begins to Smite against the
[55:51] door out there it has no control see yes
[55:58] the token is applied
[56:01] only the token is recognized see he did
[56:07] that so that the token could come the
[56:11] token was God's life
[56:15] amen so we we know we notice here the
[56:19] prophet is is explaining to us that the
[56:22] effects that the token has in our life
[56:27] and we notice here that
[56:30] through this token through that
[56:32] sacrifice God has freed us from our past
[56:37] he has set us free from our first birth
[56:42] I meant we're no longer under bondage or
[56:45] under condemnation or under guilt that
[56:48] came through our first birth he said he
[56:52] took our place there is no case
[56:56] he said case dismissed
[57:00] amen so now before case dismissed you
[57:05] could live a certain life
[57:08] but you are living a life as as a guilty
[57:12] one
[57:13] but when he says case dismissed now you
[57:18] God has given you the ability to live a
[57:21] life that you once could not live
[57:24] amen but through that sacrifice he he
[57:28] says case dismissed not guilty
[57:31] he became me so that I might become him
[57:34] by faith
[57:36] amen so now there's a life that can be
[57:39] lived that I couldn't live before as a
[57:42] result of what God has done for my life
[57:46] in my life sending me back his own life
[57:49] upon me
[57:52] amen the application it must be applied
[57:56] the token must be applied unless the
[57:59] token is applied then it's not going to
[58:03] produce anything
[58:04] it's powerful all the elements are in it
[58:07] the supernatural element is in it but it
[58:11] must be applied
[58:13] amen because without it being applied
[58:15] the supernatural element of the token
[58:18] cannot come forth
[58:21] without the supernatural element in my
[58:25] life without the token in my life I die
[58:29] the same same curse that every other
[58:32] father dies
[58:35] I die the same curse that every other
[58:37] husband dies
[58:39] right because the token is the only
[58:41] difference
[58:43] right the token is the only difference
[58:45] the only difference between Israel and
[58:48] Egypt was that there was a token that
[58:50] was applied
[58:52] amen and the only difference between the
[58:55] the elect and the non-elect is the fact
[58:58] that there's a token that has been
[59:00] applied she has applied the token to her
[59:04] life
[59:06] amen and that brings our freedom
[59:12] it costs out fear
[59:15] because I don't need to worry because I
[59:18] know who I'm walking with
[59:21] I I don't need to know the curses of the
[59:24] world I don't need to know the that
[59:26] there's there's more sickness in the
[59:28] world it seems than there ever has been
[59:29] in in history but I don't need to know
[59:32] about it I don't need to worry about it
[59:34] because I know who I'm walking with
[59:41] we could say this the life that I now
[59:44] live
[59:46] like Paul said he said the life that I
[59:49] now live
[59:50] meaning that once upon a time I didn't
[59:53] live this life
[59:54] but the life that I now live I live by
[59:58] the faith of the token
[1:00:01] amen I live by the faith of the
[1:00:04] supernatural
[1:00:05] amen which is God's own life it's the
[1:00:09] life of God living through me it's not
[1:00:13] my own life but it's his life in me it
[1:00:17] is God living in you through you
[1:00:22] it's magnificent
[1:00:24] amen we looked at this over the over the
[1:00:27] weekend
[1:00:29] God
[1:00:31] manifesting himself
[1:00:35] God in you
[1:00:37] greater is he that is in you
[1:00:42] amen then he that is in the world
[1:00:45] the token the token life is greater
[1:00:50] than any anything else it's greater than
[1:00:53] any sickness it's greater than any
[1:00:55] disease it's greater than anything else
[1:00:58] it's it's the greater it's the greater
[1:01:01] it's it's God in you it's the token life
[1:01:04] living itself in you as husband wife
[1:01:08] mother father daughter son etc
[1:01:11] etc amen Rahab had a token Israel had a
[1:01:15] token Tamer had a token but they had to
[1:01:19] apply that token
[1:01:22] the token they were given had to be
[1:01:27] applied
[1:01:29] and this end time bride has been given a
[1:01:33] token
[1:01:34] amen but if you want to know how how
[1:01:38] great this token is apply it
[1:01:43] because when you apply the token you
[1:01:47] will see the supernatural element of the
[1:01:50] token in your life
[1:01:52] it must be applied the token must be
[1:01:56] applied it's not we can Rejoice because
[1:01:59] we have a token but it must be applied
[1:02:03] just to Rejoice because we have a token
[1:02:05] is not enough the Reason God gave you
[1:02:08] the token is to apply it to your own
[1:02:12] life
[1:02:13] and meant to apply it to the doorpost a
[1:02:16] little of your own life
[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:22] again the prophet of God says here sorry
[1:02:27] to skip through this he says I don't
[1:02:29] care
[1:02:30] you might have cast out Devils you might
[1:02:33] have healed the Sick by a prayer of
[1:02:36] faith you might have done all these
[1:02:39] things but if the token is not there
[1:02:42] you're under the wrath of God
[1:02:48] so where's the focus
[1:02:51] the focus is where is the token
[1:02:55] amen the focus is where is the token the
[1:02:59] focus is not on on the the healings and
[1:03:02] wonders even though that's a part of our
[1:03:04] life but that's not the focal point
[1:03:06] the focal point is where is the token
[1:03:09] it's the same in Enoch's life the folk
[1:03:12] the focus was not the pyramid
[1:03:15] the focus was where was the token where
[1:03:17] it was God
[1:03:19] I mean God was with Enoch Enoch was with
[1:03:22] God they were walking together
[1:03:25] amen so so the we need to have put focus
[1:03:28] on the things that God puts focus on
[1:03:31] President Branham explains this whenever
[1:03:33] the scripture says verily verily he says
[1:03:36] God is trying to get your attention
[1:03:38] pay attention because there's a God
[1:03:40] wants you to listen God wants you to see
[1:03:42] God wants you to understand what he
[1:03:45] understands and he wants us to put Focus
[1:03:48] where he is focused
[1:03:53] if the token is not there you're under
[1:03:55] the wrath of God
[1:03:57] so the only thing that stops us from the
[1:03:59] wrath of God is the token
[1:04:02] is the application of the token
[1:04:05] you might be a believer
[1:04:08] you might stand in the pulpit and preach
[1:04:11] the gospel
[1:04:12] many will come to me in that day saying
[1:04:15] Lord Lord have not I prophesied in your
[1:04:16] name preached in your name have not I
[1:04:19] cast out devils in your name that's both
[1:04:22] Methodist Baptists and Pentecostal and
[1:04:25] message
[1:04:28] it is
[1:04:30] just because you affiliate with
[1:04:32] something doesn't mean you have the
[1:04:33] token
[1:04:34] the token is a revelation because
[1:04:37] there's too many people affiliated with
[1:04:39] the message that don't have the token
[1:04:41] but God desires to give you the token
[1:04:44] all right otherwise we have this group
[1:04:47] mentality otherwise we're we're Stronger
[1:04:49] by numbers but when you get alone in
[1:04:51] your at home when you're left alone you
[1:04:54] fall into error
[1:04:56] because you you only time you're strong
[1:04:58] is when you're with people there's
[1:05:00] something wrong we should be as strong
[1:05:03] as when we're with people as what we are
[1:05:05] when we're alone
[1:05:07] why because our strength is not our self
[1:05:10] our strength is the token
[1:05:12] amen the token is our protection
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:18] Jesus said depart from me you that work
[1:05:21] iniquity I never even knew you
[1:05:26] but when I see the token
[1:05:28] I will pass over you
[1:05:31] it's God's requirement for the hour
[1:05:37] the evening time message
[1:05:40] is to apply
[1:05:43] the token
[1:05:45] amen the evening time message is to
[1:05:50] apply
[1:05:51] him who has been revealed
[1:05:56] because how can you apply something
[1:05:58] that's not revealed
[1:06:00] how could Israel apply the total
[1:06:03] without the token being revealed
[1:06:06] Rahab said give me a true token
[1:06:10] in other words I don't want your opinion
[1:06:12] on the matter
[1:06:13] I I want God to use you to reveal the
[1:06:16] token to me a true token not a token a
[1:06:20] true token give me a true token amen and
[1:06:24] that's our desire for our lives Lord
[1:06:26] give me a true token
[1:06:28] amen because Ray had uh sorry Ahab Rahab
[1:06:33] knew that without the token she would
[1:06:35] die the same curse
[1:06:39] she knew it
[1:06:41] amen and they are she knew that her only
[1:06:44] protection was through the revealed
[1:06:48] token
[1:06:50] and then
[1:06:51] in the evening time she applies the
[1:06:55] token
[1:06:56] and the at the applied token can you
[1:07:00] picture this in your mind
[1:07:02] that
[1:07:03] rahab's house
[1:07:06] was the only one that stood
[1:07:09] it was the only one I mean that's a
[1:07:12] that's a miracle
[1:07:13] it's it's absolutely It's Supernatural
[1:07:16] right so there was a supernatural
[1:07:19] element to that token but but if Rahab
[1:07:23] didn't apply the token her house would
[1:07:26] have looked like the rest
[1:07:29] so it had to be applied
[1:07:32] and once it was applied
[1:07:35] people looked at rahab's house and
[1:07:38] thought how come that didn't fall
[1:07:42] when everything else fell
[1:07:45] how come that didn't fall
[1:07:48] all right
[1:07:49] and you'll notice here I've got down the
[1:07:51] bottom there Matthew 7. that's the
[1:07:53] parable of the two houses
[1:07:55] one was built upon the the sand and one
[1:07:58] was built upon a rock
[1:08:00] the the definition of the or the
[1:08:03] understanding of this Parable is as
[1:08:05] Jesus says that it is that one heard the
[1:08:08] word and did it that was the house that
[1:08:11] was built upon sand so and didn't the
[1:08:14] one that didn't do it was built upon the
[1:08:16] sand the one that did it was built upon
[1:08:19] a rock
[1:08:20] all right so we have heard the word
[1:08:23] right we have heard the word Rahab heard
[1:08:26] the word apply the token apply it let
[1:08:30] the token fall from this window apply it
[1:08:33] we have heard the word amen but if we
[1:08:37] don't apply the word
[1:08:39] then our houses were full
[1:08:43] I went to church I mean I went to BCF
[1:08:48] well that don't mean anything
[1:08:51] that doesn't mean anything to God he's
[1:08:54] not he's not looking for your where you
[1:08:56] where you congregated he's looking for
[1:08:58] the token
[1:09:00] amen and it doesn't matter if you attend
[1:09:02] Living Word Fellowship in Australia it
[1:09:04] makes no difference
[1:09:06] what church you attend what makes the
[1:09:08] difference is whether the token is
[1:09:11] applied or not
[1:09:12] amen and the application of the token
[1:09:16] brings a supernatural element to your
[1:09:20] home
[1:09:21] amen and that Supernatural element
[1:09:23] cannot be explained
[1:09:25] otherwise it's not Supernatural you
[1:09:28] explain to me how rahab's house was the
[1:09:31] only one that stood
[1:09:34] you explained to me how Israel who
[1:09:37] applied the token their homes were the
[1:09:39] only one who was safe from the death
[1:09:40] angel you you you explain that to me how
[1:09:43] how is that how how how is that possible
[1:09:47] there's a supernatural element to it
[1:09:49] that cannot be explained
[1:09:51] which means when the token is applied to
[1:09:55] our home there's a supernatural element
[1:09:58] to our home
[1:10:00] and that Supernatural element is not
[1:10:02] something I can't explain it to my
[1:10:04] neighbor I can't even explain it to you
[1:10:06] you have to get the revelation of the
[1:10:09] supernatural
[1:10:11] there was a supernatural element to
[1:10:13] Enoch's life and there is a supernatural
[1:10:15] element to this bride's life
[1:10:21] amen there absolutely is the token is
[1:10:25] the life of God in you expressing
[1:10:28] himself through you it's not you it's
[1:10:31] not me it's him
[1:10:33] and I apply the token
[1:10:36] to my office
[1:10:42] when I apply the token
[1:10:45] to my office
[1:10:47] there's a supernatural element
[1:10:50] that now dwells in that office
[1:10:57] how do we apply it by simple faith
[1:11:03] simple faith not some educated Faith or
[1:11:07] some high and mighty Faith just simple
[1:11:10] faith
[1:11:11] all right just just
[1:11:14] simply taking God at his word
[1:11:18] and applying the token applying what is
[1:11:22] the token it's the life of God to that
[1:11:25] office
[1:11:27] when I apply the token to my office as
[1:11:30] husband there's a supernatural element
[1:11:33] now that is expressed from that office
[1:11:38] when I have when I apply the token
[1:11:42] to the office of Father there's a
[1:11:45] supernatural element now to that office
[1:11:50] the life that I now live
[1:11:53] I live by the faith of the token
[1:11:57] Once Upon a Time as a husband I didn't
[1:11:59] have it once upon a time as a father I
[1:12:02] didn't have it but God has now made it
[1:12:05] possible for me to live to to to to live
[1:12:09] a life now that I once couldn't live
[1:12:12] through the token because the token has
[1:12:15] been applied to me I don't need to worry
[1:12:19] about meeting the standard or meeting
[1:12:21] the challenges of that I'm going to face
[1:12:25] as a husband because it's no longer me
[1:12:27] meeting the challenges
[1:12:30] amen it's him because I'm walking with
[1:12:33] him Enoch walked with God and was not
[1:12:37] this bride walks with God and she will
[1:12:39] not she will she will be translated that
[1:12:42] she they won't find you
[1:12:49] the life
[1:12:51] the life I now live
[1:12:55] the life that God has made possible
[1:12:59] I live by the faith of the token
[1:13:03] it's the token himself
[1:13:06] expressing himself
[1:13:08] through me
[1:13:10] because I applied the token the token
[1:13:14] must be applied the what does it mean to
[1:13:17] apply the token today
[1:13:23] it means to apply the revelation of the
[1:13:27] token to your life
[1:13:30] Christ in me the hope of glory
[1:13:34] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:13:38] when you apply that to your token to
[1:13:41] your life when you apply the token to
[1:13:43] your life then
[1:13:46] the things that weren't possible are now
[1:13:49] possible
[1:13:51] foreign
[1:13:55] the father could say to the son son the
[1:13:58] token has been applied
[1:14:00] you do not need to worry the token has
[1:14:04] been applied
[1:14:06] all right when I see the blood when I
[1:14:09] see the token I will pass over you
[1:14:14] the token is not your life
[1:14:17] it's his life
[1:14:19] when when I see my life
[1:14:23] applied to your home
[1:14:26] to your this is his home right
[1:14:28] when I see my life applied to your home
[1:14:33] then you have nothing to fear then the
[1:14:37] death angel cannot touch you
[1:14:39] the demons cannot touch you when
[1:14:43] I see the life of the blood
[1:14:47] in your life applied to your life amen
[1:14:51] so the token today is the life of God
[1:14:55] but it must be applied
[1:14:59] it must be applied in mum's life
[1:15:02] it must be applied in the father's life
[1:15:06] it must be applied in the daughter's
[1:15:08] life if she's reached that time where
[1:15:10] the time of accountability it must be
[1:15:13] applied in a son's life it must be
[1:15:15] applied to their life
[1:15:17] so what this means is that the life of
[1:15:20] God must be expressed through you and
[1:15:23] when God sees his own life
[1:15:27] he'll pass over you
[1:15:30] my my
[1:15:32] I do not need to fear
[1:15:36] if
[1:15:38] I do not need to fear as a pastor
[1:15:40] whether I will meet the challenges that
[1:15:43] I'm going to face as a pastor
[1:15:47] because the revelation of the token
[1:15:50] casts out fear
[1:15:53] perfect love casts out for you I do I do
[1:15:56] not need to worry
[1:15:59] why because the token has been applied
[1:16:03] I have applied the token to that office
[1:16:08] I have come to the Revelation where it's
[1:16:11] not me
[1:16:12] it's him
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:16] mothers do not need to fear
[1:16:19] they do not need to worry about their
[1:16:22] children
[1:16:29] it's a you know we live in a wretched
[1:16:31] world
[1:16:33] uh confused
[1:16:36] evil
[1:16:38] world
[1:16:41] but God has given you something
[1:16:44] God has given you mothers something
[1:16:47] that is greater than all the evil of
[1:16:50] this world
[1:16:52] and what he has given you is his own
[1:16:54] life
[1:16:56] he's given you a token
[1:16:58] he's given you a token that token is
[1:17:02] applied
[1:17:04] when that token is applied you don't
[1:17:06] need to worry whether you will meet the
[1:17:10] challenges
[1:17:12] that come to mothers in this hour
[1:17:16] because mothers in this hour you know a
[1:17:18] mother's love is is an incredible love
[1:17:21] but they're they're challenged
[1:17:24] in this hour because of their love for
[1:17:27] their children they're challenged by the
[1:17:30] evil that that your children might face
[1:17:32] in the shopping center your children
[1:17:34] might face at school or in the Park or
[1:17:37] wherever it might be the the fear can
[1:17:40] creep in but you don't need to fear
[1:17:43] when the token is applied you don't need
[1:17:47] to fear now I'm not saying that we stick
[1:17:49] our hand in the lion's cage and then
[1:17:51] wonder why he bit it bit us that's not
[1:17:53] what I'm saying we protect our children
[1:17:55] the best that we can protect our
[1:17:57] children but we don't need to fear
[1:18:01] okay never before have we faced such an
[1:18:05] evil time as this time never before have
[1:18:08] our children had the availability to
[1:18:11] evil like this day
[1:18:14] but I'm here to declare to you that the
[1:18:17] focus is not on what we're facing
[1:18:21] the devil wants your attention
[1:18:24] don't give it to him
[1:18:26] all right God wants your attention give
[1:18:29] it to him because the focus is not what
[1:18:32] we overcome but how we overcome all
[1:18:35] right and how we overcome is walking by
[1:18:38] faith with him that's how we're going to
[1:18:42] overcome that's where we need to focus
[1:18:45] we need to take our Focus off the the
[1:18:48] evil of the world and turn Our Eyes Upon
[1:18:51] Jesus amen look unto him the life of the
[1:18:55] token that is in you Enoch walked with
[1:18:58] God and was not this bride is Walking
[1:19:01] with God and soon she will not be found
[1:19:07] what's the focus
[1:19:10] who she's walking with
[1:19:15] what does God recognize
[1:19:19] only the token
[1:19:22] his life
[1:19:24] applied to your home
[1:19:28] this end time bride is more than natural
[1:19:34] because there is a supernatural element
[1:19:39] to her life through the token
[1:19:44] God's Bride is a supernatural bride
[1:19:50] yes she is this bride is Supernatural
[1:19:57] meaning that the supernatural will be
[1:20:01] expressed from her
[1:20:05] a husband with the token is more than a
[1:20:08] husband
[1:20:11] as Jesus was a man but he was more than
[1:20:14] a man
[1:20:15] amen you with the token are more than a
[1:20:19] man
[1:20:21] your sisters your mothers with the token
[1:20:24] are more than a mother
[1:20:26] this is why you can't evaluate yourself
[1:20:30] off a worldly mother
[1:20:33] right because you're not worldly
[1:20:36] there's more to you than the natural
[1:20:38] there's more to you than meets the eye
[1:20:42] you you have a supernatural element our
[1:20:46] our children who have the token are more
[1:20:49] than children
[1:20:51] they are Supernatural children
[1:20:54] your pasta with the token is more than a
[1:20:57] pasta he's a supernatural pasta because
[1:21:00] there's a supernatural token that is
[1:21:03] living itself through that man
[1:21:06] amen so we thank God that we can have a
[1:21:10] confidence that we need in order to be
[1:21:12] able to walk with him without fear we
[1:21:15] can walk with God totally 100 without
[1:21:19] fear because we have a revelation of who
[1:21:22] we're walking with
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:26] amen he meets the challenges of the hour
[1:21:33] he is the supernatural
[1:21:36] but she is him
[1:21:39] this bride is Supernatural
[1:21:44] in our minds we think of the
[1:21:46] supernatural in in connection with
[1:21:49] healings and miracles etc etc
[1:21:53] and that's that that's right we
[1:21:55] understand that but we also understand
[1:21:57] that it's more than that
[1:22:00] because as we saw in that quotation you
[1:22:02] can preach the gospel you know you can
[1:22:04] heal by through the prayer of faith etc
[1:22:07] etc but unless the token is applied to
[1:22:09] your life
[1:22:12] then you're going to come under the
[1:22:13] wrath of God
[1:22:15] all right so it's it's more than signs
[1:22:18] and wonders
[1:22:19] it's a it's a na it's a life that is
[1:22:22] lived
[1:22:23] on such a natural level that it goes
[1:22:27] unnoticed
[1:22:30] it's it's the life of God in dad
[1:22:35] living such an ordinary looking life
[1:22:39] through an ordinary looking man but
[1:22:42] there's a supernatural element
[1:22:45] to that office
[1:22:47] amen
[1:22:52] this is how God wants us to see
[1:22:54] ourselves
[1:22:57] God wants us to see ourselves as
[1:22:59] Supernatural
[1:23:03] by his token being in US
[1:23:09] it means that we are not subject to the
[1:23:12] curse that the world is under
[1:23:15] pornography is a curse
[1:23:18] but when you can see your yourself as a
[1:23:21] husband or a father or mother or wife as
[1:23:23] having that Supernatural element
[1:23:26] then you don't need to fall or your
[1:23:28] children don't need to fall to that same
[1:23:30] curse
[1:23:32] because greater is he that is in you
[1:23:34] than he that is in the world
[1:23:36] if we start to think on a natural level
[1:23:40] that well I guess our children just have
[1:23:42] to experience these things
[1:23:45] that's wrong thinking
[1:23:47] all right because what you've done is
[1:23:49] excluded the supernatural
[1:23:52] yeah but when there's a supernatural
[1:23:54] element in your life and that
[1:23:56] Supernatural element is your children's
[1:23:58] protection then they don't have to
[1:24:01] experience those things
[1:24:03] amen they don't have to it's it's we
[1:24:06] shouldn't fall to that type of thinking
[1:24:08] we've got to see ourselves as God sees
[1:24:11] us and that is that we're not alone
[1:24:14] we're not just natural fathers we're not
[1:24:17] just natural mothers we're Supernatural
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:21] we're Supernatural you can as a Brothers
[1:24:24] encouraged his wife to sing that special
[1:24:26] you can encourage your wife to say honey
[1:24:29] you ask us there's a supernatural
[1:24:32] element to you that is more than than
[1:24:35] just you're more than a wife you're a
[1:24:37] supernatural wife
[1:24:38] through the revelation of that token and
[1:24:42] she can do the same to him when he has
[1:24:44] his down time and he doesn't feel that
[1:24:47] he can get through she can speak those
[1:24:49] words of life to him and say honey
[1:24:52] there's more to you than you just being
[1:24:54] a husband there's more to you than just
[1:24:57] being a father you are a supernatural
[1:25:00] husband you are a supernatural father
[1:25:02] because the token is with you the token
[1:25:05] is in you
[1:25:07] amen we need to exhort one another
[1:25:11] according to the word
[1:25:13] we need to exhort one another according
[1:25:15] to the revelation of the word for our
[1:25:17] day there's no point exhorting at each
[1:25:20] other as it was in Moses or as it was at
[1:25:22] Noah's day no or as Luther or as well
[1:25:25] Wesley no we we have a word that God has
[1:25:29] given us today and that's how he wants
[1:25:31] us to exhort one another is through the
[1:25:34] revelation of that word and there's more
[1:25:36] to you than the natural
[1:25:42] there's more to you than the natural
[1:25:46] sometimes husbands and and wives are
[1:25:49] afraid to have children
[1:25:52] because of the condition of the world
[1:25:55] or because of the way that they see
[1:25:59] themselves
[1:26:02] sometimes they don't want to have
[1:26:03] children because they they deem
[1:26:06] themselves as a as a failure that you
[1:26:09] know I don't want to have children
[1:26:10] because I don't want to fail I just know
[1:26:12] I'd be a bad mother or I just know I'd
[1:26:14] be a bad father that's wrong thinking
[1:26:18] God wants you to come up higher than
[1:26:20] that God wants you to understand that
[1:26:23] once there's a token is applied you are
[1:26:26] just not any ordinary mother
[1:26:29] it doesn't matter how how what type of
[1:26:31] past you had it doesn't matter what type
[1:26:34] of child that you were when you were
[1:26:36] when you were a child
[1:26:38] there's a supernatural element to you
[1:26:41] that God wants you to understand through
[1:26:43] the token that none of that stuff
[1:26:45] matters anymore
[1:26:48] case closed
[1:26:51] amen case closed it's done it's finished
[1:26:58] amen
[1:27:00] the prophet of God says in the invisible
[1:27:02] Union
[1:27:04] he says Church
[1:27:06] you who I'm speaking to tonight Across
[1:27:09] the Nation if you've separated yourself
[1:27:12] from the nomination and all the filth
[1:27:14] and things of the world
[1:27:16] and all those things that keeps you in
[1:27:19] man-made Creeds and orders and things
[1:27:22] like that you separate yourself look up
[1:27:27] get ready the fire is going to fall one
[1:27:31] of these days God is going to to let him
[1:27:35] come and a sight to behold would you be
[1:27:39] ready when he comes would you be ready
[1:27:43] to go up with him when he comes the
[1:27:47] secret Rapture of the supernatural bride
[1:27:52] she'll be made from Mortal to
[1:27:55] immortality be changed in a moment in
[1:27:58] the twinkling of an eye we which are
[1:28:01] alive and remain shall not prevent them
[1:28:03] which are asleep
[1:28:05] amen so there's a supernatural bride
[1:28:09] this is what this is what God is calling
[1:28:11] you
[1:28:12] he's calling you a supernatural bride so
[1:28:16] so why what does God want from us
[1:28:19] he wants us to see ourselves the way
[1:28:22] that he sees us
[1:28:24] amen say if he sees me as a supernatural
[1:28:28] bride that is how this bride will see
[1:28:31] herself that there is a supernatural
[1:28:35] element to this bride
[1:28:37] amen I'm so happy tonight that there is
[1:28:41] that Supernatural element amen
[1:28:45] I want to look at this story here in in
[1:28:47] Luke Chapter 5 and just show you on how
[1:28:51] how extreme the difference is
[1:28:55] from when you do things in your own
[1:28:58] effort without the token and when you do
[1:29:01] things with the token
[1:29:04] all right
[1:29:06] I'll read from verse 1 and I may not be
[1:29:08] able to pronounce all these names but if
[1:29:11] I skip a word you'll know why
[1:29:13] it came to pass that as the people
[1:29:17] pressed upon him to hear the word of God
[1:29:21] he stood by the lake
[1:29:26] and saw two ships standing by the lake
[1:29:30] but the fishermen were going out of them
[1:29:33] and were washing their Nets
[1:29:38] and he entered into one of the ships
[1:29:40] which was Simon's and prayed him that he
[1:29:44] would thrust out a little from the land
[1:29:46] and he sat down and taught the people
[1:29:49] out of the ship
[1:29:51] now when he has left speaking he said
[1:29:54] unto Simon launch out into the deep and
[1:29:57] let down your net for a draft
[1:30:00] so we understand here
[1:30:04] by this story here that the token Jesus
[1:30:07] Christ is he was the token
[1:30:10] so the token was coming into contact
[1:30:13] with people with fishermen
[1:30:16] who had fished all night
[1:30:19] these fishermen were not recreational
[1:30:22] fishermen
[1:30:23] these fishermen were professional
[1:30:25] fishermen all right they understood the
[1:30:28] moon cycle they understood the tides
[1:30:31] they understood the the winds they
[1:30:33] understood the currents of the water
[1:30:35] they understood the bottom of the the
[1:30:37] structure that was underneath the water
[1:30:40] they understood all those things but
[1:30:43] they had toiled all night in verse 5 it
[1:30:46] says in Simon answered and sound to him
[1:30:48] Master we have toiled all night and have
[1:30:51] taken nothing so we see here that
[1:30:56] Simon had done things to the best of his
[1:30:59] ability
[1:31:01] professional fishermen keep Diaries
[1:31:04] they understand
[1:31:06] um
[1:31:07] they can go back in their diary and say
[1:31:09] okay on this moon cycle and this tide we
[1:31:12] caught this this many fish all right so
[1:31:14] so it Simon had come to an end
[1:31:18] all Simon's knowledge
[1:31:21] bought nothing
[1:31:23] It produced nothing
[1:31:25] and this is where we come as parents
[1:31:27] this is where we come as father
[1:31:30] husband and wife where we we do what we
[1:31:34] can do to the best of our knowledge but
[1:31:37] there comes a time when it produces
[1:31:39] nothing
[1:31:40] it just it just nothing comes from it
[1:31:43] husband and wife a husband and wife but
[1:31:45] the token isn't a part of their life and
[1:31:48] what all it does is is create turmoil
[1:31:50] nothing Becomes of it
[1:31:53] okay mother and father they have
[1:31:56] children but the token isn't a part of
[1:31:58] their life they're not able to produce
[1:32:00] anything
[1:32:01] 's becoming of it nothing's becoming of
[1:32:04] what they have you know they've gone by
[1:32:06] the mum said do this Dad said do this
[1:32:09] your auntie said do this grandma said to
[1:32:11] this Grandfather said do that you know
[1:32:13] that they're going off what their
[1:32:15] parents did you know and they're trying
[1:32:17] up trying to apply that to their life
[1:32:20] today
[1:32:21] but we understand that the standard of
[1:32:23] evil is rising the level of evil is
[1:32:26] rising in each generation many many
[1:32:29] times in one generation so we can't
[1:32:32] apply what what Mama did or what Daddy
[1:32:35] did in this age and expect it to work
[1:32:39] right God has got to lift that standard
[1:32:42] up but without the token for your day
[1:32:44] without the the Holy Ghost for your time
[1:32:47] for your day then you're gonna always
[1:32:50] run short
[1:32:53] all right so so Simon says this he says
[1:32:56] we've we've toil all night we've
[1:32:58] struggled all night and have taken
[1:33:01] nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will
[1:33:04] let down the net
[1:33:07] all right so we understand now that now
[1:33:11] Simon was not doing something according
[1:33:14] to his education
[1:33:17] he was not doing something according to
[1:33:19] his knowledge
[1:33:21] but now there was a token involved he
[1:33:24] was doing the same thing
[1:33:26] he was going through the same process
[1:33:30] but now the token was being applied to
[1:33:34] what he was doing
[1:33:36] all right so now he wasn't doing it in
[1:33:39] his own strength he said at Thy word I
[1:33:42] will let down the net so now he was
[1:33:45] doing it in the strength of the token
[1:33:47] the same thing
[1:33:50] the same thing
[1:33:52] I was a husband and I didn't have the
[1:33:55] token
[1:33:57] but then I became a husband with the
[1:33:59] token
[1:34:00] and now I could love my wife through the
[1:34:04] token
[1:34:05] all right
[1:34:08] and when they had done this they they
[1:34:10] enclosed a great multitude of fish and
[1:34:14] their net break and they beckoned unto
[1:34:17] their Partners which were in the other
[1:34:19] ship that they should come and help them
[1:34:21] and they came and filled both the ships
[1:34:25] so that they began to sink
[1:34:28] so now
[1:34:30] the success
[1:34:33] Pete Simon couldn't say I've been
[1:34:35] successful
[1:34:38] Simon couldn't say praise God on the
[1:34:41] husband that I need to be
[1:34:43] Simon couldn't say praise God I'm the
[1:34:45] father I need to be
[1:34:47] I I did it I did because it wasn't him
[1:34:51] it was the token that caused Simon to
[1:34:56] have a blessing to be what he was
[1:34:58] ordained to be Beyond his imagination
[1:35:02] beyond what he thought possible
[1:35:06] to a point where
[1:35:08] it was such a blessing that the blessing
[1:35:11] overflowed to others
[1:35:15] he had to call for help
[1:35:18] all right the blessing was so great that
[1:35:20] Simon couldn't contain it himself
[1:35:23] he had to that blessing went to others
[1:35:26] you know when when your life
[1:35:29] when when the token is expressing
[1:35:31] himself from your life you're not just a
[1:35:34] blessing to yourself but you're a
[1:35:36] blessing to others it overflows
[1:35:39] and you get a family where that token is
[1:35:42] applied and people become blessed
[1:35:45] because of the application of the token
[1:35:49] to that family's life other families
[1:35:52] become blessed
[1:35:54] it's it's it's just this is why you want
[1:35:56] to associate your children with Godly
[1:35:59] families
[1:36:00] because you want to be a blessing to one
[1:36:03] another
[1:36:04] amen I say Lord Lord help us
[1:36:08] the prophet of God says he says
[1:36:11] it was Peter when he was fished all
[1:36:14] night he was sitting on the bank that
[1:36:15] morning when Jesus borrowed his boat and
[1:36:18] he thrust out a little from the bank and
[1:36:20] was preaching to the people and then he
[1:36:23] said to Simon launch out into the deep
[1:36:25] and let down for the draft let down well
[1:36:28] Simon said I'm a fisherman
[1:36:31] I know the moon and the signs are right
[1:36:36] I know the fish when the fish is running
[1:36:39] I was born on this Lake here I've fished
[1:36:44] all night and haven't took even Amino
[1:36:48] I haven't taken a thing said there is no
[1:36:52] fish in there
[1:36:53] but at Thy word there you are I'll lay
[1:36:58] down the net
[1:37:00] and then so Peter was
[1:37:02] um drawing Confidence from his natural
[1:37:07] but now the supernatural was being
[1:37:09] introduced
[1:37:11] into a natural position
[1:37:15] that Peter was taking as a fisherman
[1:37:18] trying to earn a living
[1:37:20] for his children to supply for his
[1:37:23] children
[1:37:24] so the Supernatural is not refined
[1:37:27] to miracles
[1:37:30] of a husband who who has a job
[1:37:35] but the Supernatural is a part of his
[1:37:37] life
[1:37:38] do you understand that that Supernatural
[1:37:41] element flows
[1:37:44] into your natural life
[1:37:46] now you're no longer just a carpenter
[1:37:52] right
[1:37:53] because the token is a part of your life
[1:37:56] now you're you're a supernatural
[1:37:58] Carpenter you might be a housewife
[1:38:03] but you're more than a housewife
[1:38:06] I because there's a supernatural element
[1:38:08] God God walked with Enoch day and night
[1:38:13] God was with Enoch when Enoch built the
[1:38:16] pyramids
[1:38:17] all right so when you go to work you
[1:38:19] don't leave God at home
[1:38:22] and when your husband goes to work he
[1:38:25] doesn't take the token with him and
[1:38:27] leave you without it
[1:38:28] right the token is with him when he goes
[1:38:31] to work and the token is with you wives
[1:38:34] when you're at home
[1:38:36] amen I must you're a supernatural wife
[1:38:40] a wife with the token is a supernatural
[1:38:43] wife
[1:38:44] a builder a mechanic an engineer what
[1:38:49] whatever it is you're more than an
[1:38:51] engineer
[1:38:53] because God wants to be God is
[1:38:56] interested in your everyday life
[1:38:58] so what you need to do is apply the
[1:39:01] token
[1:39:03] to your life
[1:39:05] not just an office but to your life
[1:39:10] and when the token is applied to your
[1:39:12] life everything you do everything you do
[1:39:15] the token as an influencer
[1:39:19] amen this is why there's a part of you
[1:39:22] in your in your work
[1:39:25] that people don't understand
[1:39:28] there's a supernatural element to your
[1:39:31] work that people don't understand how
[1:39:33] come everyone else is going broke but
[1:39:36] you're successful
[1:39:37] well I went to college and I did this
[1:39:40] and I did that and I've got a great
[1:39:42] knowledge of that no it has nothing to
[1:39:44] do with you
[1:39:46] you've got to apply the token to your
[1:39:49] business
[1:39:49] and when you apply the token to your
[1:39:52] business now that becomes a supernatural
[1:39:55] element to that business
[1:39:58] and now you know Doom and Gloom might
[1:40:00] come to others but you're not going to
[1:40:03] come under that same curse
[1:40:05] why because there's a supernatural
[1:40:08] element that is connected to that
[1:40:10] business
[1:40:12] is the word works
[1:40:15] do the same thing
[1:40:18] through the token
[1:40:20] you'll have a different result
[1:40:22] amen be it
[1:40:24] be a be a business owner
[1:40:28] without the token you are subject to the
[1:40:31] conditions that the world is
[1:40:34] if the economy goes down you go down if
[1:40:37] it goes up you go up if it goes down you
[1:40:39] go down but what you'll find that is
[1:40:42] when the token is applied to that
[1:40:44] business you are no longer governed by
[1:40:48] what the world does
[1:40:51] because there's a token there's a
[1:40:53] supernatural element that is applied
[1:40:57] amen
[1:41:01] we can't figure these things out
[1:41:07] we can't
[1:41:10] we can't
[1:41:12] we we know how or why it's doing what
[1:41:15] it's doing
[1:41:16] but we can't figure it out
[1:41:19] all right
[1:41:22] and God is past figuring out
[1:41:26] you've got to believe it see God is
[1:41:29] known not by knowledge not by education
[1:41:32] he's known by faith and Faith only
[1:41:38] at Thy word I know there is no fish
[1:41:42] there but Thy word if you if you said
[1:41:46] let down there is fish there your faith
[1:41:49] will put it there
[1:41:52] that's all
[1:41:54] I'll let down the net
[1:41:57] amen so your faith when the Lord come to
[1:42:01] Simon
[1:42:03] Simon applied the token
[1:42:07] he applied the wood
[1:42:09] amen and in applying the word
[1:42:13] your faith
[1:42:15] in that word
[1:42:17] will put the fish there
[1:42:22] amen so so God wants to bless you
[1:42:28] but the way that he wants to bless you
[1:42:30] is by your faith
[1:42:33] in the word
[1:42:36] some people work themselves to death
[1:42:42] most people who work themselves to death
[1:42:45] haven't applied the token
[1:42:48] because when you apply the token
[1:42:51] it's your faith in that token that
[1:42:55] produces the results
[1:42:58] the application of the token is what
[1:43:01] produces results
[1:43:04] at Thy word the prophet of God says look
[1:43:07] Peter said Lord we've sinned all night
[1:43:09] and taken nothing but nevertheless at
[1:43:12] Thy word I'll let down the net there it
[1:43:15] is if God said so
[1:43:17] faith will put some fish there
[1:43:21] if there isn't any there that's right at
[1:43:24] Thy word Lord aren't we're going to let
[1:43:27] down the net that's right I wished I
[1:43:30] could stay on that a little while but I
[1:43:33] can't
[1:43:34] so it's your faith in the application of
[1:43:37] that token how is the token applied by
[1:43:40] simple faith when you apply that token
[1:43:43] to your
[1:43:45] officers
[1:43:47] it may seem like nothing is there it may
[1:43:51] look like nothing is there it you may
[1:43:54] seem like that you have nothing more to
[1:43:55] offer as a father or as a husband but
[1:43:59] when you apply the token
[1:44:01] by faith your face will put what is
[1:44:06] necessary there
[1:44:10] you may think well I don't have the
[1:44:12] strength I don't have what I don't have
[1:44:14] the strength to go on if you apply the
[1:44:17] token
[1:44:18] your faith in that token will produce
[1:44:23] strength
[1:44:25] you may come to a junction where well I
[1:44:28] don't know what to do
[1:44:31] I
[1:44:32] I'm just lost
[1:44:34] I don't know what to do in this
[1:44:36] particular situation
[1:44:39] as a husband let's say I don't know what
[1:44:41] to do
[1:44:43] as a father I don't know what to do
[1:44:46] so what am I going to do
[1:44:48] I'm gonna apply the token
[1:44:51] to that office
[1:44:54] and I'm gonna say Lord there's more than
[1:44:58] me here
[1:44:59] I may not know what to do but you know
[1:45:03] what to do so I'm going to apply the
[1:45:06] Life of Christ the life the token to
[1:45:09] that office and you watch things happen
[1:45:13] you your children may be in a place
[1:45:15] where you don't know what to do with
[1:45:16] them but if you apply the token to that
[1:45:19] office it's like God stepping into that
[1:45:23] office where all things are possible
[1:45:25] nothing is impossible for him and he
[1:45:28] simply does what you can't do
[1:45:34] it's a token life
[1:45:36] is the token must be applied
[1:45:41] it must be applied in every office
[1:45:46] that we hold
[1:45:48] and through the application of the token
[1:45:55] things happen
[1:45:59] things that you didn't think would
[1:46:01] happen happen
[1:46:04] Peter was expecting the same results
[1:46:10] he was expecting Lord we've see it all
[1:46:13] night
[1:46:14] we've dropped this Net 10 times we've
[1:46:17] dropped this net we're tired that I mean
[1:46:20] we've washed the Nets we've we're done
[1:46:22] for the day there's no fish here Lord I
[1:46:25] know what I'm doing
[1:46:26] but at Thy word Lord I'll apply the word
[1:46:30] to this oh I'll do what you want me to
[1:46:32] do I'll do what you're telling me to do
[1:46:35] he was expecting the same results but lo
[1:46:38] and behold he got different results
[1:46:41] because sometimes we don't even know
[1:46:44] what result we need
[1:46:47] we don't even know what the answer
[1:46:49] should be
[1:46:51] so how how can we expect an answer when
[1:46:54] we don't know what the answer is
[1:46:56] we don't have a clue we don't know Lord
[1:46:59] I don't know what to do many times as a
[1:47:03] pastor you come to that place where he
[1:47:05] said Lord I don't know what to do I
[1:47:08] don't know what the answer is
[1:47:12] amen but we apply the token and the
[1:47:16] answer comes
[1:47:19] God brings this solution
[1:47:22] amen apply applying the token
[1:47:28] applying the token
[1:47:30] people that they'll they'll cut there is
[1:47:33] a time and now is whether that
[1:47:36] Supernatural element like in rahab's
[1:47:38] house
[1:47:40] it doesn't mean that that's at the end
[1:47:42] time houses have fallen
[1:47:45] to the curse of this world already
[1:47:49] look down your street
[1:47:52] and tell me how many are still standing
[1:47:58] I don't mean in a physical way I mean in
[1:48:01] a spiritual way they've Fallen to the
[1:48:04] spirits of this world but for some
[1:48:07] reason on your street there's this one
[1:48:09] particular house that hasn't fallen
[1:48:13] why is that it's because there's a
[1:48:16] supernatural element to that house the
[1:48:19] supernatural element is in this house
[1:48:21] and it's not in that house but it's
[1:48:24] God's grace that the Supernatural is a
[1:48:26] part of your home
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:30] amen fathers husbands have fallen
[1:48:37] but there's a supernatural husband on
[1:48:40] Earth that hasn't fallen
[1:48:43] why because of the supernatural element
[1:48:46] in his life
[1:48:49] this this world
[1:48:51] is influencing try is influencing its
[1:48:55] own
[1:48:56] and causing its own to fall
[1:49:00] fathers husbands have fallen from their
[1:49:03] position
[1:49:05] wives mothers have fallen from their
[1:49:08] position
[1:49:09] but for some reason
[1:49:12] this is a little bitty sham guy
[1:49:16] that refuses to fall
[1:49:21] for some reason
[1:49:23] there's this there's this Mary there's
[1:49:26] this Rebecca that refuses to fall
[1:49:30] it's faithful wife
[1:49:33] who keeps that position
[1:49:35] under her under the headship under the
[1:49:39] leadership of her husband
[1:49:42] why because there's a token life
[1:49:46] is a token life
[1:49:48] that is expressing himself
[1:49:53] through her
[1:49:55] through him
[1:49:57] there's a there's a there's parents on
[1:50:00] Earth
[1:50:01] who do not fear
[1:50:03] the demonology
[1:50:06] of this world
[1:50:09] because she understands he understands
[1:50:13] the protection of the token
[1:50:17] so she's not falling to fear but she's
[1:50:20] rising in love
[1:50:23] perfect love is causing her
[1:50:26] to stand strong
[1:50:29] perfect love is causing him to stand
[1:50:33] strong
[1:50:34] as for me and my house
[1:50:37] we will serve the Lord
[1:50:39] amen why because there's a supernatural
[1:50:42] element
[1:50:43] to God's
[1:50:45] Masterpiece family
[1:50:47] amen there's a supernatural element to
[1:50:51] God's Masterpiece family so what does it
[1:50:53] mean as I close to apply the token
[1:50:58] because the token had to be applied
[1:51:01] otherwise the token hadn't had the power
[1:51:05] of the token wasn't released
[1:51:08] so what does it mean in our age
[1:51:12] to apply the token to our lives
[1:51:16] it means to apply the life of the token
[1:51:21] to the to your life
[1:51:24] and allow it to express itself
[1:51:27] through the offices
[1:51:29] that you hold
[1:51:32] by faith
[1:51:34] I apply this life
[1:51:36] his life
[1:51:38] to the office that he has given me
[1:51:41] by faith you can apply the life his very
[1:51:45] life that token life
[1:51:47] to your life
[1:51:49] and allow him to express himself
[1:51:53] through you as an individual
[1:51:57] that token life allows you
[1:52:00] or gives you a confidence
[1:52:03] as a husband
[1:52:05] as a father as a mother
[1:52:07] as what as a builder
[1:52:11] as a plumber whatever whatever office
[1:52:14] whatever occupation that you have God
[1:52:18] wants to be expressed
[1:52:20] through that office
[1:52:22] you think that's that's pretty
[1:52:25] that's pretty significant
[1:52:27] when we think about that that I'm a
[1:52:30] builder by trade
[1:52:32] but God God wants to be expressed
[1:52:36] as that Builder
[1:52:39] that doesn't mean that I've you know I I
[1:52:41] don't need scaffold anymore because
[1:52:43] there's a supernatural element not a
[1:52:44] hover off the ground and
[1:52:48] that's not what I mean
[1:52:50] but I'm in my in my conduct and Order
[1:52:54] in my my relationship to the clients
[1:52:58] you know that God wants to be expressed
[1:53:02] through that office that's that's
[1:53:04] humbling
[1:53:05] to think the King of Kings the Lord of
[1:53:08] lords the Supreme judge desires to be
[1:53:12] expressed
[1:53:13] through me as a builder
[1:53:16] through you as a housewife
[1:53:19] that that's that's God's desire
[1:53:22] amen and that's Supernatural
[1:53:25] that's Supernatural where Enoch walked
[1:53:29] with God and was not
[1:53:31] this bride is Walking with God
[1:53:35] and she will be not
[1:53:38] she she'll what at some point she'll
[1:53:41] just leave this place
[1:53:42] why because the the focus is on the walk
[1:53:46] the focus is on who we are walking with
[1:53:49] that token the token life in you
[1:53:53] expressing himself in you I don't know
[1:53:56] how many hundreds of times I've said
[1:53:57] that over the last services but you know
[1:54:00] for for me as a minister God opens the
[1:54:03] doors like God opens the door to a room
[1:54:06] and that's where he wants me to dwell
[1:54:08] and he won't allow me out of that room
[1:54:10] no matter how many times I have to
[1:54:12] repeat anything until I see what he
[1:54:15] wants me to see so I'm not responsible
[1:54:17] for what I'm telling you he's
[1:54:19] responsible for for you might say well
[1:54:22] you're just repeating what you said well
[1:54:24] maybe you need to listen
[1:54:28] [Laughter]
[1:54:31] amen there's no point
[1:54:34] I was reluctant to say this but there's
[1:54:37] no point
[1:54:38] having a Ministry of healing
[1:54:42] if your family life is a mess
[1:54:46] because the token hasn't been applied
[1:54:51] because the token life will produce
[1:54:55] but if the token life is not there
[1:54:58] no matter what signs and wonders you do
[1:55:00] no matter how many times you preach a
[1:55:02] week
[1:55:03] it makes no difference
[1:55:06] that's absolutely no difference the
[1:55:08] priority is that the token must be
[1:55:11] applied to your life and you can't say
[1:55:15] the token is applied to your life
[1:55:17] because signs follow you
[1:55:22] that's not what the prophet said
[1:55:25] the the science will follow you
[1:55:28] but that's not the focus
[1:55:30] the focus is where if the where is the
[1:55:34] token is the token applied to your life
[1:55:38] that's why me as a as a minister of this
[1:55:41] precious gospel
[1:55:43] the most important thing for me is not
[1:55:46] to minister
[1:55:49] it's not it's second
[1:55:52] the most important thing for me is that
[1:55:55] the token is a part is the preeminent
[1:55:58] part of my life and has been applied to
[1:56:03] every office of my life
[1:56:06] because my my my my
[1:56:08] children are a reflection of if my token
[1:56:13] has been applied
[1:56:15] if the token has been applied to my life
[1:56:17] or not
[1:56:20] you can bring this well praise God I'm
[1:56:23] not a minister well you you can have six
[1:56:26] million bucks in the bank
[1:56:29] and that's not success
[1:56:32] because you're six million dollars won't
[1:56:36] help your children get salvation
[1:56:39] all right so the the importance is the
[1:56:42] importance is is not our our work life
[1:56:47] the importance is the office that God
[1:56:51] has given me as husband and as father
[1:56:54] those are the two most important
[1:56:56] officers that God has given me if the
[1:56:59] token is not flowing through those
[1:57:01] offices
[1:57:03] something is wrong
[1:57:05] something is wrong all right and it's we
[1:57:09] can uh you apply this to the the sisters
[1:57:12] as well and I know there's no sisters
[1:57:14] here that do this but if you're more
[1:57:16] interested in shopping
[1:57:19] than applying the token
[1:57:21] to your children
[1:57:22] then there's something wrong
[1:57:25] right because our focal point is who we
[1:57:31] are walking with
[1:57:32] our focal point is is the token applied
[1:57:37] because as long as we're walking with
[1:57:40] God and he is walking with us there
[1:57:43] should be a token life expressed
[1:57:47] amen and what what Christ was to the age
[1:57:52] you are to your family
[1:57:55] no one took priority over him he didn't
[1:58:00] allow his priorities
[1:58:02] to become greater
[1:58:05] or unorganized his priority was his
[1:58:08] bride
[1:58:10] his priority was his wife
[1:58:13] that was his priority was the Redemption
[1:58:16] of his wife
[1:58:19] though he was tempted to become
[1:58:22] organized and get his priorities mixed
[1:58:25] up he stayed in order now I'm not that
[1:58:28] perfect
[1:58:31] sometimes I get my priority priorities
[1:58:34] mixed up
[1:58:36] all right but when I do I say Lord I'm
[1:58:40] sorry
[1:58:42] because the moment that I do it's no
[1:58:46] longer him expressing himself
[1:58:48] the moment I get my priorities mixed up
[1:58:51] now it's me
[1:58:53] and if you're sensitive enough your your
[1:58:56] life will testify of that
[1:58:59] all right your wife will begin to act
[1:59:01] different your children will begin to
[1:59:02] act different because you're out of
[1:59:04] order as a as the husband of the home
[1:59:07] you're out of order the the focus is is
[1:59:10] on you as the husband of the home to be
[1:59:12] in order
[1:59:13] to have your priorities right to allow
[1:59:17] that token life to express himself
[1:59:21] through you
[1:59:23] and things will happen that you did not
[1:59:25] expect
[1:59:27] blessings will come that you did not
[1:59:30] expect
[1:59:31] blessings will come to the to the extent
[1:59:34] that you did not expect
[1:59:36] amen the token life applying the token
[1:59:41] is applying the Life of Christ to your
[1:59:45] office
[1:59:48] applying the Life of Christ to your
[1:59:52] office
[1:59:53] and with every office that you apply
[1:59:56] that token life
[1:59:58] that office will be successful
[2:00:03] because
[2:00:05] it's not you anymore
[2:00:08] when I'm unsuccessful in my office's
[2:00:11] husband it's because it's me
[2:00:14] God is never unsuccessful well Lord you
[2:00:17] didn't you didn't achieve that you can't
[2:00:19] say that God will achieve everything
[2:00:22] that he sets out to achieve
[2:00:25] all right so if he will be what he's
[2:00:28] ordained to be but anytime that I'm not
[2:00:31] successful is because
[2:00:34] I've stepped out of order
[2:00:37] and say Lord help me
[2:00:40] help me to stay in my position under
[2:00:44] your word under your leadership you are
[2:00:48] the preeminent one you are my headship
[2:00:51] you are my leadership you are my God you
[2:00:55] are everything Lord help me to keep my
[2:00:57] position as a husband under your word
[2:01:02] amen amen
[2:01:05] praise God I hope that helps you tonight
[2:01:08] amen just wanted to be a blessing to you
[2:01:11] and I trust the Lord has blessed you
[2:01:13] tonight let's ask the brother Chad and
[2:01:16] the musicians to to come

[2:02:04] released upon the application of it
[2:02:07] in Heavenly Father Lord God we we apply
[2:02:11] this token to every office that we hold
[2:02:15] no matter who we are no matter what we
[2:02:17] are Lord God we we apply this token and
[2:02:20] we understand that through that

[2:03:52] until there's just no more to give
[2:03:59] I'm going to love
[2:04:03] love
[2:04:04] till there's just no more love
[2:04:10] foreign
[2:04:13] [Music]
[2:04:20] [Music]
[2:04:25] the way
[2:04:28] he wants me to live I'm going to give
[2:04:37] until there's just
[2:04:41] no more to give I'm going to love
[2:04:49] love
[2:04:50] till there's just no
[2:04:54] oh foreign
[2:04:58] [Music]
[2:05:06] oh aren't you thankful for the token
[2:05:09] that is not our own strength anymore
[2:05:11] amen
[2:05:13] because we've tried to be dads
[2:05:15] and how many times have we wound up like
[2:05:17] Peter
[2:05:18] with nothing
[2:05:20] we've tried to do we've tried to be
[2:05:22] whatever God wants us to be whatever
[2:05:24] he's called us to be in whatever
[2:05:26] position we've given our best effort and
[2:05:28] at times come up with nothing I'm so
[2:05:31] glad there's a supernatural element
[2:05:32] that's available
[2:05:34] and it's not just dependent on me and my
[2:05:37] ability and my effort and all of that
[2:05:39] but God will come down and Empower me to
[2:05:43] be by his strength what he's called me
[2:05:46] to be
[2:05:47] so encouraged by that that's what we
[2:05:50] need amen that's the missing piece that
[2:05:52] separates us from everybody else is his
[2:05:55] life living his life through our life
[2:05:59] I was thinking when he talked about
[2:06:00] Enoch Walking with God
[2:06:03] it's amazing but it's absolutely
[2:06:06] impossible for Enoch to walk with God
[2:06:09] unless God presented himself to Enoch I
[2:06:13] mean where would he not find him amen
[2:06:15] where would he not go and grab a hold of
[2:06:17] him and hold his oh he no man can find
[2:06:20] God God has to come to man and in this
[2:06:23] generation God has presented himself to
[2:06:25] us so that we can walk with him
[2:06:28] is not a mystery we're not in job's day
[2:06:30] where he says where is he the work if I
[2:06:32] could walk knock on his door and ask him
[2:06:34] questions he has presented himself to us
[2:06:37] so that we can walk with him what a
[2:06:40] privileged people we are
[2:06:42] so thankful for that
[2:06:44] and something I was thinking there well
[2:06:46] brother Daniel was preaching there at
[2:06:48] the end
[2:06:50] a father
[2:06:52] can sacrifice
[2:06:55] and give of himself for his children
[2:06:58] because God can sacrifice for his
[2:07:01] children
[2:07:02] a mother can lay down her life and
[2:07:05] sacrifice her time her energy her sleep
[2:07:07] everything for her children because God
[2:07:10] can sacrifice for his children and if
[2:07:12] God lives in that father that father can
[2:07:14] give himself for that family and if God
[2:07:17] lives in that mother that mother can
[2:07:19] surrender her own life for the life of
[2:07:21] her children without that it's not
[2:07:23] possible but the one who makes it
[2:07:25] possible is the one who's promised to
[2:07:27] live inside of us
[2:07:29] amen sometimes we struggle to sacrifice
[2:07:33] to surrender to give up but it's no
[2:07:37] sacrifice for God
[2:07:39] he surrendered he gave up he gave of
[2:07:42] himself and if we could just receive his
[2:07:45] life we could surrender we can give up
[2:07:47] we can give of our sins
[2:07:50] all the potentials are there
[2:07:52] amen I'm encouraged
[2:07:55] I'm encouraged not my strengths
[2:07:58] but by thy Spirit oh God man we love you
[2:08:03] it's been a good time I've had a good
[2:08:04] time
[2:08:05] this last week amen I've learned a lot
[2:08:08] I've grown I feel like I've grown a lot
[2:08:11] I've been challenged I've been
[2:08:13] encouraged and I just thank God for
[2:08:16] using our brother amen how many of you
[2:08:18] remember to pray for him this weekend
[2:08:20] and this week because they go back home
[2:08:21] and for the whole family we love you all
[2:08:24] you're in our prayers you mean the world
[2:08:26] to us amen and we thank God for this
[2:08:29] time I mean it's been a wonderful time
[2:08:31] amen
[2:08:32] amen let's just thank God together for
[2:08:36] what he's given us Lord Jesus
[2:08:38] go without you
[2:08:40] what are we who are we what can we do
[2:08:45] but God when you called for a generation
[2:08:48] to give the greatest expression
[2:08:50] in a many member body
[2:08:53] you provided everything that was
[2:08:55] necessary
[2:08:56] to be that great expression
[2:08:59] God you unlocked yourself when you took
[2:09:02] the seals off of the book lord when you
[2:09:05] brought broke the nominational chains of
[2:09:08] misunderstanding and wrong
[2:09:09] interpretation and wrong thinking
[2:09:12] when you broke us out of ignorance and
[2:09:14] foolishness
[2:09:15] you gave us the potential
[2:09:18] God all we have to do is receive what
[2:09:21] you've done in this day to believe it to
[2:09:24] receive it to allow it to take over our
[2:09:26] lives this word that you've opened in
[2:09:29] this day is yourself Lord
[2:09:32] if we can just surrender to that and let
[2:09:34] your life flow through us
[2:09:36] then Lord we can be the fathers and
[2:09:39] mothers that you intended for us to be
[2:09:41] we can be the brothers and sisters we
[2:09:44] can be the workers we can be the
[2:09:45] teenagers we can be whatever it is
[2:09:48] you've called us to be we can be that
[2:09:49] Lord because you have Unchained and
[2:09:52] Unbound Yourself by every denominational
[2:09:54] change and brought yourself Lord into
[2:09:58] full manifestation
[2:10:00] God help us to walk with you
[2:10:02] [Music]
[2:10:03] Lord help us to forget everything else
[2:10:05] and walk with you
[2:10:07] Lord God make that the greatest desire
[2:10:10] of our hearts is to walk with you
[2:10:12] God whatever it is we have to do and
[2:10:15] whatever it is we've thought and the
[2:10:16] past was important May Lord we have the
[2:10:19] courage and the ability by your grace to
[2:10:22] make walking with you the greatest
[2:10:24] privilege of Our Lives
[2:10:26] God in this generation Lord God we you
[2:10:31] came to a prophet on a Mountaintop in
[2:10:33] Colorado and you said why don't you walk
[2:10:36] with me
[2:10:37] and that Prophet lord said that would be
[2:10:40] my greatest desire
[2:10:42] oh God lord if that's what you wanted to
[2:10:45] do with that Prophet Lord that's what
[2:10:47] you want to do with us Lord You're
[2:10:49] inviting us to walk with you and God I
[2:10:51] want to say that would be my greatest
[2:10:53] pleasure on Earth is to walk with you
[2:10:57] God we thank you for presenting yourself
[2:10:59] to us in this generation
[2:11:02] and God made Lord you just take us by
[2:11:05] the hand and may we keep our hand in
[2:11:06] yours may you lead us along the way and
[2:11:09] may you do the impossible Lord you do it
[2:11:12] through us as we surrender to you and
[2:11:14] give you first place
[2:11:16] but I pray Lord that you would just pour
[2:11:20] a blessing out upon our brother Daniel
[2:11:22] Lord for he's poured out of himself Lord
[2:11:24] as you led him to in these last four
[2:11:27] services but God I pray you would pour
[2:11:29] back into him and may he go home
[2:11:31] strengthened and encouraged and
[2:11:33] refreshed and may he be able to pour out
[2:11:35] to his congregation again Lord with an
[2:11:38] abundance that you've poured into him
[2:11:39] bless his wife and his children and the
[2:11:42] family and those that have come with him
[2:11:44] I pray he took him safe journey home
[2:11:46] Lord they've been special to us and good
[2:11:48] to us and we have been blessed by them
[2:11:50] and I pray you'd bless them in return
[2:11:53] and God I pray I know the desire of my
[2:11:56] brother's heart
[2:11:58] is not to go home saying Lord those were
[2:12:00] good meetings
[2:12:01] but to know that they brought a change
[2:12:04] in somebody's life and I pray God that
[2:12:08] you would reward your servant for his
[2:12:09] faithfulness by that that this word will
[2:12:12] take an effect and find a place in the
[2:12:15] hearts of men and women and produce life
[2:12:17] that this word that was preached would
[2:12:19] become manifested life in your children
[2:12:22] and you can start with me in my life
[2:12:25] Lord I want the words that were preached
[2:12:28] and the things that I heard to be alive
[2:12:30] in me Lord and on display in this flesh
[2:12:33] and I surrender to what you have told me
[2:12:36] Lord in these Services may it live Lord
[2:12:39] in me and in all your children Lord as
[2:12:42] we cry out to you we ask it in Jesus
