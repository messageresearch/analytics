[0:00] but we're going to find out is noah
[0:02] built this ship
[0:04] god is a master craftsman
[0:09] there's not a human engineer can out
[0:10] engineer god
[0:14] and god knew exactly how high the waves
[0:16] would be
[0:18] he knew how much rain would fall he knew
[0:20] what course the ship would have to take
[0:22] he knew he knew everything that was
[0:25] going to have to happen he knew how many
[0:26] animals would have to hold how much food
[0:28] it was going to have to hold
[0:31] like can you imagine god says okay i'm
[0:33] going to take two
[0:35] of every kind of unclean beasts seven
[0:37] pairs of every
[0:38] uh clean beast we're going to keep them
[0:40] of every kind
[0:41] we're going to put them in the ark gotta
[0:42] have enough food and provisions and i'm
[0:44] not gonna tell you how long but just
[0:45] have lots of food and provisions
[0:47] and figure it out
[0:51] i would be like one two three
[0:55] how many animals how many square foot
[0:57] per an animal
[0:59] how much food does each species eat i
[1:01] mean what kind of food how much food
[1:03] what quantities we do see god told him
[1:05] all that because god already had it all
[1:07] figured out
[1:08] and friends i'll tell you today god's
[1:10] got it all figured out
[1:12] he sent a prophet he doesn't always give
[1:14] us the explanation of why
[1:16] he just tells us the truth he shows us
[1:18] in the word we take the word we don't
[1:20] always know why but we know it's got to
[1:22] be this way
[1:25] so many times people question what the
[1:27] prophet said because they
[1:28] don't clearly see it they don't clearly
[1:30] understand it and then they want to
[1:32] regulate it to the prophet's opinion
[1:36] because if i regulate it to the
[1:37] prophet's opinion i can use my reasoning
[1:39] on the word amen and i can still
[1:41] accomplish my own lusts
[1:45] but i'm telling you if the prophet is
[1:46] telling us something over and over and
[1:48] over again
[1:49] and he's telling us it's the word and he
[1:50] telling us god it doesn't
[1:52] you know what it doesn't even matter if
[1:54] you can piece it together in the bible
[1:58] that's a vindicated prophet of god amen
[2:00] i would say
[2:01] god just help me lord help me to obey
[2:04] help me to be
[2:04] simple-minded enough of a farmer and a
[2:07] shepherd and not an engineer or
[2:09] theologian where i can just take what he
[2:10] said and say be it unto me lord
[2:12] let me obey that with all of my heart
[2:16] if that's the way you want me to act if
[2:18] that's the way you want me to address is
[2:19] this what you say about marriage and
[2:20] divorces this is how we're supposed to
[2:22] raise children
[2:22] if this is how we're supposed to conduct
[2:24] church
[2:26] if this is who qualifies for this
[2:27] position and this who qualifies for that
[2:29] amen i'm going to say amen lord help us
[2:32] to do it exactly the way you said do it
