[0:00] so here in the in the mount carmel
[0:02] showdown where elijah is restoring the
[0:05] the proper form of worship he's
[0:06] rebuilding the altar that was tore down
[0:09] he's bringing them to a showdown and
[0:11] he's asking them how long will you haul
[0:13] between two opinions he's saying now
[0:15] you're it's time to make a choice you
[0:17] can't just have everything right amen
[0:20] and brother ben said frankly i think
[0:22] it's going on worldwide he said it might
[0:23] be happening for you today but i frankly
[0:25] i think it's going worldwide but there's
[0:26] also coming a time where you're going to
[0:28] have to make a choice and i say don't
[0:30] wait for that day make the choice now
[0:33] will we have the world amen mixed with
[0:35] the message will we have old doctrines
[0:38] carried over from previous age mixed
[0:39] with the message or are we going to take
[0:41] the word and the word only the way a
[0:42] prophet gave it to us amen are we going
[0:45] to make a choice for the word and stay
[0:47] with the word regardless of whatever
[0:49] happens to us or what people think of us
[0:51] amen of separations and rejections and
[0:54] hardships let's take the word and the
[0:56] word only and take it the way a prophet
[0:58] delivered it to us amen
[1:01] and so elijah is saying it wasn't that
[1:04] they rejected altogether jehovah it
[1:06] wasn't that they accepted altogether
[1:08] baal they were mixing the two together
[1:10] and elijah was standing against hybrid
[1:12] religion
[1:14] because the elijah in our day was
[1:15] standing against hybrid religion he
[1:18] built back the altar of sacrifice he
[1:19] built back the proper form of worship
[1:21] and in the time of the evening sacrifice
[1:24] he called on god and god supernaturally
[1:26] vindicated his ministry we've had a
[1:28] replica in our day and the replica in
[1:30] our day is calling us to make a choice
[1:35] it's not just god sent a prophet god god
[1:38] sent a prophet to call us to an
[1:40] attention that would this is not
[1:42] pleasing to jehovah this mixing of these
[1:45] ideas he doesn't want any more mixing
[1:47] this isn't the day of mixing this isn't
[1:49] the day of partial understanding this is
[1:51] the day of the restoration of the
[1:53] headship of christ the word has come
[1:56] back to the church
[1:58] and god wants a people that will be
[2:00] faithful by their own choosing
