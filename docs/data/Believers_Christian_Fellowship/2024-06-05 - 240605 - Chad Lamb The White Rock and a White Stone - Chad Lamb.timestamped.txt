[19:04] continue to pray for them as they
[19:06] recover but they wanted us to express
[19:08] their
[19:09] gratitude then back here in Revelation 8
[19:14] verse1 uh We've we've looked at this
[19:16] many times and I want to I want to look
[19:18] at it again um brother Franco if you
[19:20] could go ahead and pull up the
[19:21] PowerPoint for me I'm going to go
[19:23] through a PowerPoint we're going to do a
[19:24] little bit of review and it's not all
[19:26] review but some review and I'm want to
[19:28] preach on the White Rock and a white
[19:30] stone and uh you'll see why we titled
[19:33] that as we move along uh the last time
[19:36] uh brother Gabe preached he started
[19:38] touching on some of these things and him
[19:40] and I had a conversation around back
[19:41] that I got pretty excited about and we
[19:43] were just touching on some points and
[19:46] and uh and I can't get it off my mind
[19:48] and so I came and uh preached uh Sunday
[19:51] and on Sunday I started touching on
[19:53] Junior Jackson's dream and the and the
[19:55] White Rock and the dream and started
[19:57] touching on some of those things but I
[19:59] actually left feeling quite rushed like
[20:01] I just rushed through it and I and and I
[20:03] hate doing that and so I just was
[20:05] determined as we were moving into
[20:07] Wednesday I started meditating on it and
[20:09] I just determined that we're going to
[20:10] back up and do a little review and
[20:12] really lay down the foundation because I
[20:15] realized uh I thought that you know we
[20:18] talk about this all the time I've
[20:19] preached it over and over again and we
[20:21] have but when I went back and looked on
[20:23] the last time I preached on Junior
[20:25] Jackson's dream and the White Rock it
[20:27] was five years ago and a lot changes in
[20:30] 5 years we've got young people coming up
[20:32] we've got new people moving into the
[20:33] assembly and then some of us don't
[20:36] remember everything and so it's so good
[20:37] to go over it again amen and so I really
[20:41] I really when I looked into it I said I
[20:42] want to touch on that once again it is
[20:45] the heart of the message it's it's the
[20:47] heart of what God has done in this day
[20:50] and it means so much to us and when we
[20:52] look at
[20:53] Revelation uh 8 if you could back up
[20:55] with me and look at chapter 5 we're just
[20:58] going to do a scan we're not going to
[21:00] read but in chapter 4 we come to the in
[21:04] chapter 3 we come to the end of the
[21:05] church ages uh and then John is told uh
[21:10] to come up higher and there's an open
[21:11] door in heaven and in chapter 4 he moves
[21:14] through the open door this is after the
[21:15] church ages are over he moves into a
[21:18] higher realm amen and in that realm he
[21:20] sees the throne room of God and he sees
[21:22] one sit on the throne amen and then in
[21:24] chapter 5 there's a cry that goes out
[21:27] amen who is Worthy come and take the
[21:29] book and loose the seals and no one no
[21:31] man in heaven or on Earth or under the
[21:33] Earth was found worthy to take the book
[21:35] to loose the seals or even to look
[21:38] therein but then he says he starts to
[21:40] weep because he knows if nobody can take
[21:42] this book all Redemption is lost amen
[21:45] and then an elder says to him weep not
[21:47] John for the lion of the tribe of the
[21:49] Judah has prevailed Amen to take the
[21:52] book and the loose the seals thereof and
[21:53] when he looked he looked for a lion but
[21:55] he saw a lamb a bleeding beat up lamb
[21:58] and and he took the book and he and when
[22:00] he took the book there was singing and
[22:02] rejoicing in heaven and then we come to
[22:04] chapter 6 when we come to chapter six
[22:06] the lamb begins to break the seals and
[22:09] so in chapter 6 uh verse one says and I
[22:13] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[22:14] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[22:16] of Thunder one of the four Beast saying
[22:18] come and see and I saw and behold a
[22:21] white horse and he that sat on him had a
[22:23] bow and a crown was given unto him and
[22:25] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[22:28] so we see that now the lamb has taken
[22:31] the book in in chapter 6 and he begins
[22:34] to open the seals and now we have an
[22:36] opening of the seals but this opening of
[22:39] the seals is opening brother bandam said
[22:41] in a church form and so in a symbol form
[22:45] it opened enough symbolically so you can
[22:47] see the symbols that were veiled in
[22:50] there so you wouldn't get the real
[22:52] revelation of it but the symbols just so
[22:54] the church would know that there's
[22:55] something to it so he said it come forth
[22:57] in a church symbol symbolizing that
[23:00] there's a seal and here's the symbol of
[23:02] the seal it symbolized with a white
[23:04] horse rider going forth but the
[23:06] revelation of what that means is not
[23:08] there yeah right and he goes through
[23:11] chapter six and he goes through all six
[23:13] seals and so through through the six
[23:15] seals in chapter six then it breaks into
[23:18] chapter 7 chapter 7 is a chapter that
[23:21] that explores the uh tribulation period
[23:24] and the 144,000 ceiling and and those
[23:27] that came through Great Tribulation
[23:29] then we come to Revelation 8 when we
[23:31] come to Revelation 8 now we're going to
[23:34] see the lamb open the seventh seal all
[23:37] right and when he had opened the seventh
[23:40] seal there was silence in heaven about
[23:42] the space of half an hour so now we
[23:44] already recognize that though it's
[23:46] opened in symbol form we're catching the
[23:49] symbol that when he opened this seal
[23:51] it's not like the other six when he
[23:53] opened the other six something happened
[23:55] we saw a white horse there was a lot of
[23:57] symbols that went went with that he had
[23:59] a crown was given he had a bow amen we
[24:02] saw there was no arrows you see so much
[24:04] information under the six but under the
[24:06] seventh there's
[24:07] nothing
[24:09] silence and so then let's go over to
[24:12] Revelation chap 10 we're going to jump
[24:16] because Revelation chap 10 is also the
[24:19] seventh
[24:20] sealen I'm just going to tell you that
[24:22] I'm not going to I'm not going to prove
[24:23] it to you en tile the scripture we'll
[24:25] look into it later but Revelation 10 1:7
[24:28] brother brandham says is the seventh
[24:30] seal so Revelation
[24:33] 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[24:37] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[24:39] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[24:41] face was as it were the Sun and his feet
[24:42] as pillars of fire brother B said this
[24:45] is Christ so in the seventh seal now
[24:49] when we come over to Revelation 10 which
[24:50] is the seventh seal amen now we see the
[24:53] coming of Christ as the mighty angel now
[24:56] we're not we're not talking about about
[24:58] the flesh man that was crucified but
[25:00] we're talking about Jesus Christ Christ
[25:03] The Mighty angel coming
[25:05] spiritually
[25:07] amen and he had in his hand a little
[25:10] book open and brother B said this is the
[25:12] same book that was closed and sealed in
[25:14] chapter 5 now it's open in chapter 10 so
[25:17] we see now there's an open book in the
[25:19] seventh seal in this coming and he had
[25:23] in his hand a little book open and he
[25:24] sat his right foot upon the sea and his
[25:26] left foot upon the Earth and he cried
[25:28] with with a loud voice as when a lion
[25:29] roared and when he had cried seven
[25:32] Thunders uttered their
[25:34] voices and when the seven Thunders
[25:36] uttered their voices I was about to
[25:38] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[25:40] saying it to me seal up those things
[25:43] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[25:44] write them not so this is where brother
[25:47] benam starts to talk about amen those
[25:50] seals that were sealed all right because
[25:53] now there's there's when he Roars like a
[25:55] lion seven Thunders utter their voice
[25:58] and John was about to write because
[26:00] brother B tells us John heard the
[26:02] Thunders and knew what they were they
[26:05] were intelligible they were something he
[26:07] understood and comprehended and was able
[26:09] to write out what the seven Thunder said
[26:12] but the voice told him not to write them
[26:14] but to seal them up so now we have Seven
[26:19] Seals you understand why seven Thunders
[26:23] seven Revelations cuz each Thunder was a
[26:25] voice of God speaking something and each
[26:27] Thunder was now sealed Again by John so
[26:30] there you have Seven
[26:33] Seals right this is why brother B says
[26:35] you have seven seals on the inside of
[26:37] the book and Seven Seals on the back
[26:39] side of the book amen he says now the
[26:41] the ones on the back side of the book
[26:43] aren't open he said there's nothing
[26:44] written about them we have we have
[26:45] nothing there's not one word written
[26:47] about them he's talking about these
[26:49] seven Thunders that John was told to
[26:51] seal right amen okay so brother's never
[26:55] talking about 14 seals yeah but there's
[26:58] seals that we see open in a church form
[27:01] or symbol form now there's Thunders that
[27:03] are a voice of God declaring something
[27:06] but he's told to seal them up so now
[27:09] there's seven SEALS or the Thunders are
[27:12] sealed those are the Seven Seals brother
[27:15] man talks about on the back side of the
[27:17] book sometimes he talk about backside
[27:18] and within and he he sometimes switches
[27:20] it but you understand what he's talking
[27:22] about amen we don't want to you know
[27:25] sometimes the brother brandham is so
[27:30] perfect for what God wanted to use him
[27:32] for God wanted to use him to declare a
[27:35] truth amen but he didn't want to use him
[27:37] to intellectually explain anything amen
[27:40] because he had to leave it in mystery
[27:42] form so that only the bride would get
[27:44] the revelation of what he was bringing
[27:47] so he was perfectly suited to do what
[27:49] God wanted him to do amen even brother
[27:51] Benham says I hope you understand what
[27:53] I'm trying to say I don't have education
[27:56] enough to explain it he says but I know
[27:58] what I'm talking
[28:00] about so and and brother bham is
[28:03] catching the Revelation by Vision amen
[28:06] and he's trying to explain what he's
[28:08] seeing brother B you have to understand
[28:10] he's not catching the Revelation out of
[28:12] a textbook so he can't read it and
[28:16] repeat to you what he just read because
[28:18] that would be
[28:20] intellectual but he's a profit and he's
[28:22] getting it by vision and he's trying to
[28:24] discern himself the vision and explain
[28:27] because the vision is not coming with
[28:30] words there's no words it's a vision the
[28:33] vision brings a revelation now it's up
[28:35] to him to try to bring words together to
[28:38] explain the
[28:39] Revelation and God used a hillbilly from
[28:43] Kentucky with the seventh grade
[28:44] education so that he could come and
[28:46] explain what he saw and it would still
[28:48] be veiled to the intellectual mind so
[28:51] that we wouldn't get it through
[28:52] intellectualism we could only get it by
[28:54] Revelation from the father
[28:59] so many times I wish he would just
[29:00] explain it plain he's not supposed to
[29:02] explain it plain he's just supposed to
[29:05] tell you what he
[29:07] sees oh I love it so
[29:11] much
[29:13] amen and many times when you see brother
[29:15] B he's even trying to understand what
[29:18] he's
[29:19] seeing cuz the Revelation didn't come
[29:21] from a
[29:23] textbook it didn't get it in a text
[29:26] message he got it through vision
[29:30] and we would think that the prophet
[29:32] would have it so clear and so easily
[29:34] spelled out amen and he would just read
[29:36] no it it that's not the way it came it
[29:40] came by vision and he himself got a
[29:42] revelation off that vision and now he's
[29:44] trying to preach his Revelation that's
[29:47] right
[29:50] amen praise God this thing is is only
[29:54] going to be given and revealed by
[29:56] revelation
[29:59] so now these seven Thunders were sealed
[30:03] says SE
[30:06] seal up those things which the seven
[30:08] Thunders uttered and write them not and
[30:11] the angel which I saw stand upon the sea
[30:13] and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[30:15] heaven and swear by him that liveth
[30:17] forever and ever who created heaven and
[30:19] the things that therein are and the
[30:21] earth and the things that therein are
[30:23] and the Sea and the things that are
[30:24] therein that there should be time no
[30:27] longer this is really important phrase
[30:29] time no longer that's why brother
[30:31] brandham says this seventh seal is the
[30:33] end time seal he's looking at this
[30:36] section in scripture and that's where
[30:37] he's getting it that's why when he
[30:40] preaches um is this the sign of the
[30:42] Enders he's asking the question is this
[30:45] the sign of the ERS is this those seven
[30:48] Thunders is this what H took place in
[30:51] Revelation 10 because that Mighty Angel
[30:53] when he raised his hand and and he
[30:55] declared time shall be no more mark
[30:58] This is the End Time amen the end of
[31:01] time so that's when all this happens
[31:04] that's right amen that time should be no
[31:06] longer verse 7 but in the days of the
[31:08] voice of the seven Angel when he shall
[31:10] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[31:12] be finished as he had declared to his
[31:14] servants the prophets praise God so now
[31:18] let's let's launch in I've got a lot to
[31:21] go through and I got a lot of quotes but
[31:23] I put almost everything on the overhead
[31:25] amen so we'll just keep going as quickly
[31:27] as we
[31:29] can uh in the message is this the sign
[31:31] of the end sir I want you to notice that
[31:34] title I mentioned it to you before but
[31:35] don't forget the question is is this the
[31:38] sign of the answer and why is he coming
[31:41] to preach this message he's coming to
[31:42] preach this message because he had an
[31:44] experience the week before and the
[31:46] experience the week before amen it was
[31:49] like it was a capping off of six dreams
[31:52] different brothers and sisters came to
[31:53] give him so in this message he explains
[31:55] to you all six dreams the brothers were
[31:57] coming over a period of a few months and
[31:59] they gave him a dream and then another
[32:01] dream and he didn't give any of them the
[32:03] interpretation of the dream he just kept
[32:05] hearing them then another one come and
[32:07] another dream and another dream and
[32:08] another dream and another dream amen and
[32:11] then he has this experience in his room
[32:14] amen early one morning amen where all of
[32:16] a sudden he goes into a vision and in
[32:18] the vision he sees uh Little Birds a
[32:20] little cluster of little birds coming
[32:22] and they're flying towards them and they
[32:23] light on a branch and they fly off amen
[32:25] and then little bigger birds like doves
[32:27] they they come and they fly off and he
[32:30] understands that this is the first and
[32:31] second pool amen The Healing Ministry
[32:34] that went off and then the discernment
[32:35] that flew and then the next amen there
[32:38] was a constellation of seven angels in a
[32:41] pyramid form he said amen and then there
[32:43] was a blast that went off amen he got
[32:45] caught up amen and he nearly lost
[32:47] himself he say it took him hours to come
[32:49] out of that he was caught up into this
[32:51] constellation of angels amen at the same
[32:54] time he finds out that they're going to
[32:56] widen his Street
[32:58] and when he finds out they're going to
[32:59] widen his street they're going to have
[33:01] to take out his gate and it reminds him
[33:03] of a vision he had years ago of where
[33:06] his gate was laying there was rocks all
[33:07] around amen and remember he ends up
[33:10] there was a smart like there and he
[33:11] punches him he slaps him down he picks
[33:13] him up slaps him down again and said I'm
[33:15] not mad at you you just can't talk to me
[33:17] that way I wish I could slap somebody
[33:20] down not be mad at him I but this is a
[33:23] vision you know and so and then in the
[33:26] vision says uh be careful be cautious
[33:29] when this happens go west and then he
[33:31] saw himself in a prairie scooner with
[33:33] his family loaded in like they were
[33:35] traveling and they were going to the
[33:36] West right and so now at the same time
[33:39] all of this everything's culminating and
[33:41] coming together at once and he's finding
[33:43] out they're going to widen the street
[33:44] and they're going to take out take out
[33:46] his gate and those were the rocks that
[33:47] he saw laying around and all of a sudden
[33:49] with this experience he realizes now
[33:52] this is the time that I have to go west
[33:54] and he's asking is this the sign of the
[33:57] ins
[33:59] is this the end
[34:01] time and he comes back and preaches the
[34:04] he comes back and preaches the seventh
[34:06] seal and in the seventh seal he says
[34:08] this is the end time so it was
[34:11] questioned before the seals is this the
[34:12] sign of the end and and he answers it in
[34:14] the seven seal and says this is the end
[34:16] time this is the sign of the end
[34:18] absolutely he was correct so he
[34:21] vindicates everything that he was saying
[34:23] in CES is the time all the speculation
[34:26] and what he was probing at and amen when
[34:28] he comes to the seventh seal proves to
[34:29] be
[34:31] true so now in this message is this the
[34:34] sign of the answer I want to read and
[34:38] and note I want you to note this is
[34:39] taking place this is a Sunday evening
[34:42] service on December 30th next to the
[34:45] last day it's not the last day of the
[34:47] year I made a mistake and said that
[34:49] wrong before it's not the last day of
[34:51] the year the next day they'll have a
[34:52] watch Night Service and that's important
[34:54] because we're going to get to a quote
[34:55] out of that watch Night Service he says
[34:57] is this the sign of the inser and he
[35:00] said he came to me and he said something
[35:01] is on my heart I must tell you brother
[35:03] brandom I said go on brother Jackson and
[35:05] he said I dreamed a dream and there it
[35:08] was when he says there it was that means
[35:10] he's seeing it now yeah and there it was
[35:13] I just sat still and I listened and
[35:16] watched he said I dreamed that there was
[35:18] a great big hill like out in a field
[35:20] where Blu grass or something was and
[35:23] said and said up on top of this hill
[35:26] where the water had washed away the soil
[35:28] there was a top rock up on top the hill
[35:31] like the top of a mountain it was Rock
[35:33] no grass and where the water had washed
[35:35] down it had cut some kind of readings on
[35:37] these stones and you were standing there
[35:39] interpreting this reading on these
[35:41] stones and said all of us and here is
[35:44] the way he put it said the Brethren from
[35:45] George and from all around we were all
[35:47] standing together listening to you
[35:49] interpret that mysterious writing on
[35:51] those stones that mountain and he said
[35:54] then you picked up something like from
[35:55] the air something like a wrecking bar or
[35:58] crowbar wasn't it Brothers something
[36:00] like that A Wrecking Bar real sharp and
[36:02] said it how you done it I don't know
[36:05] said you struck the top of that mountain
[36:06] ripped it around and lifted the cap of
[36:08] it off it was in the shape of a pyramid
[36:11] and you ripped the top of it off now
[36:14] that was months and months and months
[36:15] before the pyramid message was preached
[36:18] what pyramid message is he talking about
[36:19] here he's talking about stature of a
[36:21] perfect man that's important to know cuz
[36:23] stature of a perfect man was was it was
[36:26] the capping off of the adoption
[36:28] message so we have to understand this
[36:30] has everything to do with adoption and
[36:33] adoption is the full maturity at the end
[36:36] time amen it's all ties together
[36:41] friends sir and he said it said beneath
[36:45] that was White Stone Granite and you
[36:48] said the Sun or the light has never
[36:50] shined on this before look look in on
[36:53] this watch this and that's right because
[36:55] in the formation of the world the world
[36:57] was formed before there was light we all
[36:59] know that God moved upon the water and
[37:01] then he began he spoke for light
[37:02] naturally down under there in the age
[37:04] that formation was that light had never
[37:06] come upon the stone he's talking about
[37:08] in the natural form of it amen the earth
[37:11] was formed before the light came so he's
[37:12] showing that within this Rock Amen was a
[37:15] White Rock and light had never shined on
[37:17] that before means it had never been
[37:20] illuminated or seen
[37:22] before amen this is going to be a
[37:25] revelation that light had never shined
[37:27] on on before because a stone is a type
[37:29] of Revelation amen and so now there's
[37:32] the night's never shine nobody's looked
[37:34] on this but he says now when I take the
[37:37] top off he's telling the Brethren now
[37:38] you look on
[37:40] this right but there was nothing to read
[37:43] it was just a White Rock oh this is so
[37:46] good these all these details mean
[37:49] something and so just just just listen
[37:51] as we tie them together these brothers
[37:53] were told to stand and look at this
[37:55] White Rock yeah
[37:58] what are they supposed to see I don't
[38:00] know there's nothing written on it but
[38:02] they're supposed to stand and look at
[38:04] it said light has never shined on this
[38:07] before because there was a revelation
[38:09] contained within the word that nobody
[38:12] had seen before it was the mystery of
[38:13] God and it was that mystery that was
[38:16] held in the back part of God's mind
[38:18] which no light had ever shined on before
[38:21] nobody had seen back to the back part of
[38:23] God's mind it was hidden or veiled
[38:26] within God himself self and light had
[38:28] never shined on that the same thing with
[38:30] this White Rock it's a revelation that
[38:32] light had never shined on before now he
[38:36] said look on this watch this he said and
[38:39] he he said look and and he said look
[38:42] upon this light has never come upon it
[38:45] before and when all of them got up and I
[38:47] told them to watch that and all of them
[38:49] come up to look in but he said while
[38:52] they were looking in he looked out the
[38:55] corner of his eye I believe it was and
[38:56] watched me I slipped off to one side and
[38:59] started going towards the West towards
[39:01] the setting of the sun come up a hill go
[39:03] down a hill come up a hill go down a
[39:05] hill getting smaller and smaller and
[39:06] went all the way out of
[39:09] sight so what happened was in the he's
[39:12] now he's interpreting the vision the
[39:14] last thing he told the brothers was you
[39:16] look on this white stone and they saw
[39:18] brother Brenham going to the West all
[39:21] right so let's look at this uh quote
[39:26] together and and then notice in some
[39:28] mysterious way we picked up out of the
[39:30] air a sharp tool that opened up the top
[39:33] and in there was white granite but it
[39:35] wasn't interpreted there was no letters
[39:37] I didn't interpret that Junior I just
[39:39] looked at it and said to the Brethren
[39:41] look on this and that's fulfilled
[39:44] tonight brother Brenham said that part
[39:47] where he said look on this it was being
[39:50] fulfilled right there in that service on
[39:53] December 30th in the evening service on
[39:55] Sunday he's telling them what is the
[39:58] White Rock he told them to look at he
[40:00] starts off his message and serves as
[40:02] this the time Revelations 10 1-7 showing
[40:06] them that there was seven Thunders that
[40:07] were sealed and nothing not one word was
[40:10] written about it and nobody knows what
[40:12] it is and that's the White Rock he's
[40:15] telling them to look at he peeled the
[40:18] top off of it and the capping of the
[40:20] Bible is in Revelation he took the cap
[40:22] off of it and told them there's
[40:24] something here that has to be revealed
[40:28] and that's the Fulfillment of that first
[40:31] part of Junior Jackson's dream and he
[40:33] comes to the people in this message and
[40:35] he says look at these Thunders could it
[40:38] be these Thunders something has to be
[40:39] revealed these Thunders it's never been
[40:41] known what the Thunders were and he's
[40:42] preaching Thunders Thunders Thunders
[40:44] Thunders all through is this the sign of
[40:46] the end sir and he's pointing them to
[40:49] the mysterious white rock that lights
[40:51] never shined on there's not one word
[40:54] written about the Thunders amen
[40:58] and then what does he tell him at the
[40:59] end of the service I'm going
[41:02] west and that's the the last part of
[41:05] Junior Jackson's dream he's going
[41:08] west he said and while they were
[41:10] studying that I slipped towards the West
[41:12] what for here's this question what for
[41:15] maybe to understand the interpretation
[41:17] of what's on top of this could it be so
[41:21] all through this message this message
[41:22] title is a question is this the sign of
[41:25] the end sir all through the message he's
[41:27] asking questions yeah amen so he's going
[41:31] to come back from the west and answer
[41:33] all these
[41:35] questions so here brother Franco helped
[41:38] me put this together I thought he did a
[41:40] marvelous job so they they there was a
[41:43] hill in the dream and and on the hill
[41:45] the coming out the top where the water
[41:46] had run down and washed it off was a
[41:48] rock and there was writings in it that
[41:50] had got etched in by the water and
[41:51] brother Benham was going around
[41:53] interpreting and brother bam tells us
[41:55] all the time amen that he he was there
[41:57] to tie up the Loose Ends from the seven
[42:00] Church ages amen those things that were
[42:02] lost amen but what were they they were
[42:05] scriptures amen they were scriptures
[42:08] that had been lost on water baptism in
[42:10] jesus' name on The Serpent seed on the
[42:12] godhead on all of these things and he
[42:15] says when and brother's clear he says
[42:17] when he's done tying together the Loose
[42:19] Ends then the S thunder sound so in the
[42:22] vision he's going around and when he
[42:24] finishes interpreting the writing on the
[42:26] outside side when he finishes
[42:28] interpreting what's written in the word
[42:30] tying together all the Loose Ends from
[42:32] the church ages now it's time to find
[42:35] out what's inside so when he was done
[42:38] interpreting he grabbed that sharp tool
[42:41] and peeled the top off and showed them
[42:43] that there's something that light's
[42:45] never shined on before nobody's even
[42:47] been able to read it on the outside yeah
[42:51] amen right not even a symbol of it y
[42:55] nothing silence
[42:58] and so he pulls the top off and he tells
[43:01] them brothers to stay there and look at
[43:05] it and then he goes
[43:08] west and when he goes west now this is
[43:12] December all right
[43:14] 1962 and just a few weeks later in
[43:17] February 20 or yeah Fe not not February
[43:20] 28th in January sometime just a few
[43:22] weeks after that he's out west and he
[43:24] goes to sabinaa Canyon and he calls all
[43:26] the way up amen the pull pit Rock and
[43:28] while he's standing there praying he's
[43:29] got his hands in the air and when his
[43:31] hands are in the air something strikes
[43:32] his hand and when he looks it's a sword
[43:34] and he says oh it's a sword and the
[43:36] voice said the king sword amen and and
[43:38] then and then he starts thinking about
[43:40] well a king and he says in his heart
[43:42] inside it thundered out the king sword
[43:45] and he realizes this is the king sword
[43:47] and he said it fit my hand perfectly and
[43:49] he told us later what it was it's the
[43:51] word in the hand meaning the word is
[43:53] going to come to the
[43:55] prophet and that in January then in in
[43:59] in February 28th amen that's when the
[44:02] cloud comes down and the pictures are
[44:03] taken to the cloud and sometime after
[44:05] that brother banham is caught up into
[44:07] the constellation of the cloud and told
[44:09] to go back East for the interpretation
[44:12] of the revelation of the Seven
[44:14] Seals what did he go out there for the
[44:16] White Rock what did he call the White
[44:18] Rock the seven Thunders what was he told
[44:20] to go back to reveal the Seven Seals
[44:27] amen I love it same message time shall
[44:31] be no more he announces that time is
[44:35] over what happens what happens could
[44:37] that be so now Brethren seriously think
[44:40] if it is then the pyramid is capped by
[44:43] the seven
[44:44] Thunders you remember the pyramid
[44:46] message is the Capstone what did it the
[44:49] Holy Spirit capped off the individual
[44:51] sealant when we added to our faith
[44:53] righteousness godliness Faith this is
[44:54] Statue of a perfect man so for and kept
[44:57] adding till we got to seven things and
[44:59] the SE and the seventh one which is
[45:01] actually the eighth one is is love which
[45:03] is God that's how he makes the
[45:05] individual and caps him and seals him
[45:07] with the Holy Spirit then if that be so
[45:11] he's got seven Church ages and he's had
[45:13] seven Mysteries that's been sounded away
[45:15] and they fought for to bring back and
[45:17] now the headstone comes to cap off the
[45:20] church does the Thunders mean that my
[45:22] brethren s is that where we're at
[45:27] yeah does the Thunders mean that that
[45:29] he's going to come and reveal that
[45:31] mystery that time is no more that we're
[45:32] at the end of time does the Thunders
[45:34] mean that Brethren and the answer is yes
[45:37] because when he goes out amen this is
[45:39] the sign that God gives amen the cloud
[45:42] which is seven angels Wings amen making
[45:44] a cloud amen that's outlining the head
[45:46] of Christ but it's coming down in
[45:48] pyramid form or Capstone form and it's a
[45:51] white
[45:53] pyramid cuz what are they they're seven
[45:55] angels bringing what the Rev contained
[45:57] in the Seven Seals which are the seven
[46:00] Thunders praise God and where did
[46:03] Brother brandom get caught up he got
[46:04] caught up into this amen pyramid this
[46:10] Capstone now in the seventh seal now I
[46:12] want you to note now we're in the
[46:13] seventh seal he's preached the seals
[46:16] he's come to the seventh seal remember
[46:17] when he comes to the seventh seal he's
[46:19] not allowed to explain the third
[46:23] pool okay I don't want you reading
[46:29] we are a very rebellious
[46:33] people if the use
[46:39] Force
[46:40] amen so now when he comes to the third
[46:44] pool but what was the third pool he says
[46:47] now we go back to his vision he has in
[46:49] the room the week before he preaches
[46:52] serves this the time says those first
[46:54] little birds were beat up little brown
[46:56] birds
[46:57] second was like doves he said That's The
[46:59] Healing Ministry and now this is
[47:02] discernment first and second pool but
[47:05] the third pull was them
[47:07] Angels picking me up into the secret of
[47:11] themselves into the white Capstone
[47:14] bringing me back for the revelation of
[47:16] the Seven Seals so what is the third
[47:18] pool it brother Bram said it's the
[47:20] opening of the word what opening of word
[47:23] the word that's been sealed in the
[47:25] pyramid that lights never shined on that
[47:28] would that John was told to seal up and
[47:30] right not amen that's what the third
[47:32] pull
[47:34] is that's what the vision's pointing us
[47:36] to so he's bringing him back for the
[47:38] third pool what was the third pool
[47:41] supposed to accomplish and you go back
[47:43] to his original and the end of 1955 he
[47:46] has the what we call the tent Vision
[47:47] dream but the tent Vision dream starts
[47:49] off with a fishing dream it doesn't
[47:51] start with ttin fish and starts off with
[47:53] fishing and in fishing he sees that
[47:55] there's rainbow trout big ones out in
[47:58] the deep water and all the ministers are
[48:00] gathered around the bank and they're all
[48:01] catching fish but they're all catching
[48:03] little fish and he sees those rainbow
[48:05] trout and he says I think I can catch
[48:08] them and so the whole point of the
[48:11] vision is he's trying to get the big
[48:13] rainbow trout what are they the Covenant
[48:16] fish what Covenant fish the children of
[48:19] God all these out here are catching
[48:21] little fish but he's targeting the
[48:23] rainbow trout and it's going to take
[48:25] three pools and Amen to get hooked the
[48:28] rainbow trout and bring them in Lord so
[48:31] the whole point of the third pull amen
[48:33] is to catch those Covenant Fetch and I
[48:36] think it's miraculous and amazing that
[48:38] in this prophet's lifetime that he goes
[48:41] to the river that he calls the River of
[48:43] No Return amen that's not the official
[48:45] name of the river but he calls the River
[48:46] of No Return and God allows this Prophet
[48:49] to catch the world record rainbow trout
[48:52] in his lifetime and have it mounted to
[48:54] prove that this man is a man that can
[48:57] catch rainbow trout he knows what he's
[49:00] talking about he's got the tactics is
[49:01] fishing down and God showed in the
[49:03] natural what this man was doing in the
[49:05] spirit world
[49:07] record not a big one world record the
[49:11] biggest one he
[49:14] caught because God was using him in the
[49:16] third pool to Target the Covenant
[49:20] fish so what is it that catches the
[49:22] bride it is the Mysteries revealed
[49:25] that's what's catching the bride
[49:27] it is the unveiling of Christ it is the
[49:30] unveiling of the mystery of God it's the
[49:32] veil being taken off the word amen and
[49:34] that's what's catching the bride amen
[49:37] praise be to
[49:38] God so now he comes back for the third
[49:44] pool and now he comes to the seventh
[49:48] seal now remember when he was back there
[49:51] he said could this be what what was I
[49:54] going out west for and this isn't uh
[49:57] when he preached is this the end of the
[49:58] sign sign of the
[50:00] ERS he says maybe to get the
[50:04] revelation of that White Rock could it
[50:07] be he said could it be now he comes to
[50:09] the seventh seal he says now notice now
[50:11] when this taken place he goes back to
[50:13] Junior Jackson's dream Junior was
[50:15] standing in the field had a big pyramid
[50:17] to like that and there was something
[50:18] wrote on the rocks and I was revealing
[50:20] that to the people is that right Junior
[50:21] about a year before it happened and
[50:23] notice the next thing now I took some
[50:25] kind of bar and cut it off and on the
[50:27] inside was right White Rock that had
[50:30] nothing Road on it and at that time I
[50:32] started out west and I told them all I
[50:34] said don't go out west stay here and
[50:37] look on this till I return went West for
[50:41] the blast returned back to the east with
[50:43] the Holy Spirit interpreting this
[50:46] Unwritten word amen so he says could it
[50:49] be yes that's exactly what he went to
[50:52] get the interpretation for the unwritten
[50:54] word the White Rock that was underneath
[50:56] The
[50:58] Rock now if and remember when he was
[51:01] preaching on that rock Under The Rock he
[51:03] starts to whole first half of that
[51:05] message preaching about the Thunders and
[51:07] the part that was sealed and nothing
[51:09] written about it this has everything to
[51:11] do with the seven
[51:13] Thunders he says now if that isn't
[51:16] perfectly the God Almighty I want you to
[51:18] know what it is what am I trying to say
[51:21] this for friends is to show you we're at
[51:24] the end time
[51:26] what was the message he preached before
[51:28] he went out west is this the sign of the
[51:31] end sir now he comes to the seventh seal
[51:34] said I went West for the blast to come
[51:36] back to interpret the unwritten word and
[51:39] and and he says we are at the end time
[51:43] he answered the question he answered
[51:46] both the questions did I go for this yes
[51:48] is this the end
[51:50] yes we are at the end
[51:53] time Revelation 10 1-6
[51:57] seven now in the seventh seal again it
[51:59] says the seventh angels I was in the
[52:01] west you remember the little bitty
[52:03] Messengers that went East the second
[52:04] messengers the doves little bit bigger
[52:06] bird they went East and they was with me
[52:09] all the time that was the first and
[52:10] second pool now the third come from the
[52:13] West sweeping forward with great
[52:14] terrific speed and they picked me up
[52:17] that was coming back East with the
[52:19] mystery of these Seven Seals just like
[52:21] it said in junior Jackson's dream that
[52:23] the Lord let me interpret for him there
[52:26] on the the inside of that pyramid there
[52:28] was a white stone that wasn't written on
[52:31] that's the reason I had to go
[52:35] west what Seven Seals did he have to
[52:38] interpret amen the ones that were sealed
[52:40] up on the back part of the book what the
[52:43] seven Thunders had
[52:44] said he goes on to say I want to read
[52:47] this last sence again that's the reason
[52:48] I had to go west to connect with these
[52:51] angels message to come back here to
[52:53] reveal it to the church you remember I
[52:55] said the next thing that will happen
[52:57] will be here at the church that's just
[52:58] exactly another thing I want you to
[53:00] notice what taken place and if you're
[53:02] listening to the tape of what time is it
[53:04] sir see now he starts calling it what
[53:06] time is it sir because now he knows the
[53:08] answer it's the end
[53:11] time you will notice that one Angel was
[53:14] very notable to me the rest of them was
[53:15] just seemed ordinarily but this Angel
[53:18] was noted Angel he was to me left in the
[53:21] constellation in the form of a pyramid
[53:24] and remember it was in the pyramid where
[53:26] the mysterious White Rock was not
[53:28] written on and the angels took me into
[53:31] that pyramid of themselves the mysteries
[53:34] of God known only to them and now they
[53:38] with the messenger that came to
[53:39] interpret that pyramid or that message
[53:42] of the secret of those Seven Seals which
[53:45] lays with inside the pyramid amen
[53:51] amen again in the seven seal now the
[53:53] angel was to my left would really be the
[53:56] last or seventh angel if we would count
[53:58] them from left to right because he was
[54:00] on my left we looked toward him towards
[54:03] the West he came towards the east would
[54:05] be on my left so that would be the last
[54:07] Angel's message very notable you
[54:10] remember how I said he kind of had his
[54:12] head back and a grape sharp wings and
[54:13] how he flew right to me now that is this
[54:17] seventh seal that seventh angel was
[54:20] coming to him he said he came right to
[54:23] me that is this seventh seal
[54:27] amen it's still a notable thing and we
[54:30] don't know what it is yet because it's
[54:32] not permitted to be broken praise be to
[54:35] God he was told you won't explain this
[54:38] one so why when he comes to the seven
[54:40] seal he comes all the way up and he says
[54:42] I feel to stop right here I got on my
[54:43] notes say no
[54:45] more all right now this is a little
[54:48] confusing when he says he was the angel
[54:50] on the left Amen in the constellation
[54:53] but he was really the seventh angel
[54:55] counting left to right and what brother
[54:56] Bram is saying is when he's standing in
[54:59] the west amen he's looking towards the
[55:02] west and he says into
[55:04] eternity all right he says they came out
[55:07] of Eternity and swept down so he's
[55:09] looking off into the West coming from
[55:11] the West if you count left to right you
[55:13] go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 that's the seventh
[55:17] angel he said but when they picked me up
[55:19] into the constellation we were going
[55:21] east and going east he was the one on my
[55:24] left that's why brother Brenham says
[55:26] that and if you read through it
[55:27] carefully you'll see what he's talking
[55:28] about that's why he's the angel in the
[55:30] less but he's the seventh
[55:32] angel praise God and that's the notable
[55:35] one to him that's this seven seal and it
[55:38] comes right to him cuz brother brandham
[55:39] is the messenger of the seven
[55:43] seal now again in the seventh seal when
[55:46] when will it be brother brandham I
[55:47] cannot tell you I do not know but one of
[55:50] these days if we if we never meet again
[55:53] on this Earth We're going to meet Yonder
[55:54] at the Judgment seat of Christ and you
[55:55] will find find out that in the room the
[55:57] Revelation coming from God just like all
[56:00] the rest of them has that one of the
[56:02] mystery of that seal the reason it
[56:04] wasn't revealed it was seven Thunders
[56:06] that uttered their voices and there it
[56:09] is perfectly because nothing knows
[56:11] anything about it wasn't even written so
[56:14] we're at the end time we are here what's
[56:17] he saying part of that seventh seal is
[56:21] the revelation of the seven Thunders
[56:27] let's keep going did you notice when the
[56:29] Jews asked him that you know when he
[56:31] compared the scripture here with Matthew
[56:33] 24 with the six seals the seventh seal
[56:35] was left out we don't have time to go in
[56:37] that today but we may again here soon
[56:39] because you see Christ said only God
[56:41] himself knowed not even the angels no
[56:44] wonder it wasn't even written you see
[56:46] they hushed nothing taking place then
[56:48] Angels don't know it nobody knows when
[56:51] he's
[56:52] coming what's he talking about he's
[56:54] talking about the seventh seal talking
[56:55] about revelation 81 silence in heaven
[56:58] and he tying it to the seven Thunders
[57:00] sealed up those things that were uttered
[57:02] nobody knows when he's coming it's the
[57:04] coming of the Lord said there will be
[57:06] seven voices of these seven Thunders
[57:08] that will reveal the great Revelation at
[57:11] that time whoa so the seven Thunders the
[57:15] seven voices of the seven Thunders will
[57:17] reveal the great Revelation at that time
[57:20] what time at the time that nobody knows
[57:22] when he's coming the seven seal the
[57:25] mystery of Revelation 81 amen it's
[57:27] revealed under the mystery of Revelation
[57:30] 10
[57:31] 1:7 that Reveals His coming cuz only the
[57:34] lamb can open the seals only the lamb
[57:36] can reveal the seals amen praise be to
[57:40] God so now now he's telling us what this
[57:43] seventh seal is all about it's the
[57:44] coming of the Lord and there'll be seven
[57:47] voices of those seven Thunders that will
[57:48] reveal the great Revelation at that time
[57:51] what are they revealing they're
[57:52] revealing he's
[57:53] come because he comes with an book in
[57:56] his hand the mighty Angel descended sir
[58:00] so I believe to us if we don't know it
[58:04] it won't be known till that
[58:07] time but it will be revealed in that day
[58:10] in The Hour That is supposed to be
[58:12] revealed in this is such a veiled
[58:16] comment you can even see he he he halts
[58:20] his words he stumbles a little bit now
[58:22] he says I believe to us if we don't know
[58:24] it if we we it won't be known till that
[58:28] time but it will be revealed in that day
[58:31] in the hour that it's supposed to be
[58:32] revealed
[58:33] [Music]
[58:36] in that just depends on where you're at
[58:39] in the sequence of time amen whether
[58:41] it's revealed to you or not so the thing
[58:43] for us to do is to be reverent before
[58:45] God and serve him and do all that we
[58:47] know how to do and live good Christian
[58:49] lives here now we find that the Sixth
[58:52] Seal has been opened to us we see it and
[58:54] we know that this seven seal cannot be
[58:56] broke to the
[58:59] public amen until that hour arrives why
[59:03] cuz he won't tell this is the third pool
[59:04] you won't tell it to nobody it'll be
[59:06] when it begins it'll be a total
[59:09] secret now there was some reason that
[59:12] God let us let this seven voices be
[59:15] thundered because it must come for we
[59:19] find that Christ the lamb took the book
[59:21] in his hand and he opened the seventh
[59:23] seal but you see it's a hidden Mystery
[59:27] that's Revelation 881 he took the book
[59:30] and he opened the seventh seal but there
[59:32] was silence see it's a hidden
[59:34] Myster amen no one knows it but it's
[59:39] right along with what he said no one
[59:42] would know his coming they also would
[59:46] not know about this seven ther mystery
[59:48] so you see it's connected together amen
[59:53] praise God this is why brother brandom
[59:56] when you get into the seals and you read
[59:57] through your seals book the prophet of
[59:59] God is saying in the seals he says he
[1:00:02] says I hope you're catching what's going
[1:00:05] on and he says this throughout the seals
[1:00:07] you'll catch him saying these statements
[1:00:09] I'm just going to give you I'm
[1:00:10] paraphrasing I'm just going to give them
[1:00:11] to you as I remember he says it's going
[1:00:14] on all around you
[1:00:17] amen he says I I hope you see what's
[1:00:21] going on all around you he goes I keep
[1:00:23] waiting for somebody to stand up in
[1:00:25] their seat and say I see it brother
[1:00:26] brandom I see
[1:00:27] it can you imagine sitting in the crowd
[1:00:30] that day and you're like what what what
[1:00:32] is it you're watching is carefully as
[1:00:34] you can you're writing down his
[1:00:35] scriptures and what he's trying to get
[1:00:37] you and he's saying this not in one seal
[1:00:39] he's saying this over seven days and he
[1:00:41] says oh I hope you get it just wait till
[1:00:43] we get to Sunday night over there we get
[1:00:45] to the seventh seal because he thinks
[1:00:47] he's going to reveal it amen but then he
[1:00:49] he he's told to stop and not reveal it
[1:00:51] when he gets there amen but he's telling
[1:00:52] you you just wait till Sunday night you
[1:00:54] wait till we get over there oh just
[1:00:56] waiting for somebody like he said I'm
[1:00:57] waiting for somebody stand up and say I
[1:00:59] see it brother brandom said it's going
[1:01:01] on all around you and you're not
[1:01:02] catching it then he comes to the last
[1:01:04] day and he says you're not getting it
[1:01:05] you're not supposed to get
[1:01:08] it what were they not supposed to get
[1:01:10] what was going on on around them every
[1:01:13] day he was preaching the Thunders he
[1:01:15] come first day first Thunder second day
[1:01:17] second Thunder Third Day third Thunder
[1:01:19] it was the Mysteries that was contained
[1:01:21] in the Seven Seals he was now
[1:01:23] interpreting the symbology and telling
[1:01:24] you the mystery that l behind that it
[1:01:27] was the revelation of the seven Thunders
[1:01:29] and it was taking place all week and
[1:01:30] he's saying it's going on all around you
[1:01:33] and you're not getting it what was going
[1:01:35] on all around them the revelation of the
[1:01:37] seven Thunders was coming forth now it's
[1:01:40] marking the end time the mighty Angel
[1:01:42] has descended the lamb has taken the
[1:01:45] book and now the revelation of the seven
[1:01:47] Thunders is showing you he opened the
[1:01:49] seven
[1:01:52] seal and he's he's just waiting for
[1:01:55] somebody stand up in her seat and say I
[1:01:56] see it brother
[1:01:58] bam if I was if I could go back there
[1:02:01] now with what I have now I'd be standing
[1:02:04] up and saying I see it brother bam I see
[1:02:06] what you're talking about this is this
[1:02:08] is what you were saying and is this the
[1:02:10] sign of the end s this is what you were
[1:02:12] talking about it's happening right
[1:02:15] now praise
[1:02:18] God he wanted them to see it so bad all
[1:02:22] week but then he comes to the last day
[1:02:24] and he's resolved now
[1:02:26] you're not supposed to see it then he
[1:02:29] comes to the seventh seal says I feel to
[1:02:31] stop say no more now remember the baby
[1:02:34] shoe and remember Sabino Canyon and
[1:02:36] remember Junior Jackson's dream and he
[1:02:38] starts tying all this together then he's
[1:02:40] telling you now it's not broke it's not
[1:02:42] it's not permitted to be broke yet and
[1:02:44] it won't be broke to the public now it
[1:02:46] won't it won't be it's not it will be
[1:02:48] revealed if you don't know it then it's
[1:02:50] not revealed till the time it's supposed
[1:02:51] to be
[1:02:54] revealed once you see it you go back and
[1:02:57] see exactly what the prophet's saying
[1:02:59] before then I would read what he's
[1:03:01] saying and I'm scratching my head what I
[1:03:03] don't know I don't understand but once
[1:03:05] the Revelation comes you go back and I
[1:03:07] see exactly what the prophet of God is
[1:03:09] doing
[1:03:10] amen he knew that it had to come by
[1:03:13] Revelation and it was going to take
[1:03:18] time and that's why he said don't add no
[1:03:21] interpretation don't try because it's so
[1:03:23] simple if you tried you would mess it up
[1:03:26] amen yes yes so now he says when he
[1:03:31] opened that seventh seal it's a hidden
[1:03:35] mystery no one knowed it right along
[1:03:37] with that he said no one would know his
[1:03:38] coming and also they wouldn't know about
[1:03:40] the seven Thunder mystery so you see
[1:03:42] it's connected
[1:03:46] together the seventh seal now when they
[1:03:48] get when that gets on tape which it is
[1:03:51] that'll probably send 10,000 of my
[1:03:53] friends away from me cuz they're going
[1:03:54] to say brother bandam trying to put
[1:03:56] himself and make himself a servant or a
[1:03:59] prophet or something before God let me
[1:04:01] tell you my brethren that's an error I'm
[1:04:04] only telling you what I seen and what
[1:04:06] has been told to me and now you do
[1:04:08] whatever you want to I don't know who's
[1:04:11] going or what's going to take place I do
[1:04:13] not know I just know that those seven
[1:04:16] Thunders holds the mystery that Heavens
[1:04:18] was
[1:04:19] quieted amen what's that the seventh
[1:04:23] seal everybody understand
[1:04:29] amen questions and answers 1964 this is
[1:04:32] August 1964 over a year later have the
[1:04:36] seven Thunders which equals seven
[1:04:38] Mysteries already been revealed were
[1:04:41] they revealed in the Seven Seals but are
[1:04:43] yet but are yet not known to us as the
[1:04:46] Thunders yet he said no they were
[1:04:49] revealed in the Seven Seals that's what
[1:04:52] the Thunders was about
[1:04:55] they was to reveal the seven Thunders
[1:04:57] that had uttered their voices and no one
[1:04:59] could make it out was John knew what it
[1:05:02] was but he was forbidden to write it he
[1:05:04] said but the seventh angel in the days
[1:05:07] of his sounding the seventh my the seven
[1:05:10] Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be
[1:05:12] revealed yeah the seventh angel who's
[1:05:15] the seventh angel and the seventh angel
[1:05:18] is a messenger of the seven Church
[1:05:21] AIDS which is William
[1:05:24] brandham which is also the Fulfillment
[1:05:26] of Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 Amen in
[1:05:30] that day yes sir amen the seventh angel
[1:05:33] in the days of his sounding the seven
[1:05:36] Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be
[1:05:38] revealed amen they're not going to be
[1:05:40] revealed later they're going to be
[1:05:41] revealed under his ministry
[1:05:44] amen then he and then comes to the leoan
[1:05:46] church age out of the church age book he
[1:05:48] says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:05:51] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:05:53] things according to Malachi 4 he will
[1:05:55] turn turn the hearts of the children to
[1:05:56] the fathers two he will reveal the
[1:05:58] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:06:00] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:06:03] contained in the Seven
[1:06:05] Seals it will be these divinely revealed
[1:06:08] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:06:10] hearts of the children to the
[1:06:12] Pentecostal
[1:06:13] fathers what what does that mean that
[1:06:16] means the seventh angel the Elijah of
[1:06:19] Malachi 4 amen has to be the one who
[1:06:23] brings the revelation of the seven
[1:06:25] Thunders amen not another man not
[1:06:28] anybody else it has to happen in his
[1:06:30] ministry under his sounding he's got to
[1:06:32] bring the revelation of the seven
[1:06:33] Thunders and if you don't have the
[1:06:35] revelation of the seven Thunders you
[1:06:37] don't have the Fulfillment of Malachi 4
[1:06:40] he can't be Malachi 4 without the
[1:06:42] opening of The Seven seal he can't be
[1:06:44] Malachi 4 without the coming of the Lord
[1:06:46] he can't be Malachi 4 without the
[1:06:48] revelation of the seven Thunders because
[1:06:50] it takes these revealed mystery truths
[1:06:53] to literally fulfill Malachi 4 turn the
[1:06:56] hearts of the children back to the
[1:06:57] Pentecostal fathers so you can't have
[1:06:59] brother banham as Malachi 4 and not have
[1:07:02] him amen as the one who reveals the
[1:07:04] seven
[1:07:06] Thunders amen it doesn't work if he did
[1:07:09] not in his sounding reveal the seven
[1:07:11] Thunders then he did not fulfill Malachi
[1:07:15] 4 so if the Seven Seals not open he
[1:07:18] wasn't who he said he was and who we
[1:07:19] believe he is if Christ hasn't come he's
[1:07:22] not who he says he is and not who we
[1:07:24] believe he is amen so it's we we've come
[1:07:27] to the place in the message it's all the
[1:07:29] way or nothing amen it's either right or
[1:07:31] it's not right we can't hang up halfway
[1:07:33] anymore he's either who we believe he is
[1:07:35] and who he says he is and who God
[1:07:37] Vindicated him to be or we need to go
[1:07:39] start something else because you can't
[1:07:41] mix this with your own thinking anymore
[1:07:44] it's got to be the Fulfillment of the
[1:07:48] word amen still tons of things we don't
[1:07:51] understand all kinds of questions I got
[1:07:54] I I I I agree there's still things that
[1:07:56] he's got to unfold things I don't
[1:07:58] understand things he said I don't
[1:07:59] comprehend but that doesn't change
[1:08:01] anything he has got to be the seventh
[1:08:03] angel that's on Earth at the time of
[1:08:05] this coming when the mighty Angel comes
[1:08:07] down with an open book in his hand and
[1:08:09] the Seven Thunders are revealed which
[1:08:11] reveals the mysteries of the Seven Seals
[1:08:13] that's the time he has to be
[1:08:18] here and then it has to be finished when
[1:08:21] he's
[1:08:22] here so we're not adding anything to to
[1:08:25] it we don't have to add anything to it
[1:08:28] all we have to do is ask God to open our
[1:08:30] eyes to see
[1:08:32] it amen and once we see it if I could
[1:08:35] just add this once we see
[1:08:39] it just because we describe it with
[1:08:43] other scriptures and brother Brenham
[1:08:44] described it with and we use other types
[1:08:46] and shadows than what he used doesn't
[1:08:48] mean we're adding to the
[1:08:51] message right sometimes there's a
[1:08:54] there's a ality that can be only say
[1:08:58] what the prophet says amen only say what
[1:09:00] the tape say so that means I can only
[1:09:02] quote exactly what brother BM said
[1:09:03] that's the only way I can preach that's
[1:09:05] the only way that I can explain anything
[1:09:07] so that means that all I could do is
[1:09:08] stand up here and read list of quotes I
[1:09:11] can't say anything else but what he's
[1:09:13] saying is say what the tapes say what
[1:09:15] are the tapes saying listen you can
[1:09:18] quote the tape and not say what the
[1:09:20] tape's saying just like you can quote
[1:09:22] the scriptures and not say what the
[1:09:24] scriptures are saying it's not verbatim
[1:09:26] reading it's a catching the revelation
[1:09:29] of what's on the tape and then you can
[1:09:31] go anywhere in the scripture because the
[1:09:33] opening of The Seven seal opens your
[1:09:36] understanding it opens up the entire
[1:09:38] Bible brother Brandon's Bible became a
[1:09:40] new book your and my Bible should become
[1:09:43] a new book we should see the seven seal
[1:09:45] the coming of the lord The Mystery of
[1:09:47] the Thunders the great mystery of the
[1:09:49] mystery of God we should find it
[1:09:51] everywhere in every crack in every
[1:09:53] crevice places that brother B didn't
[1:09:55] have time to go he wasn't on Earth that
[1:09:57] long after the opening of the seals his
[1:10:00] Bible became a new book and he had less
[1:10:02] than 3 years to
[1:10:04] preach but now we've had 60 some years
[1:10:07] to preach the message we should still be
[1:10:09] finding it new places all through the
[1:10:11] Bible and we should be saying what the
[1:10:13] tapes say Amen by catching the
[1:10:15] revelation of the word and coming amen
[1:10:18] with the same Revelation he had now I
[1:10:20] see what he sees and I didn't get it
[1:10:23] from a textbook because he didn't get a
[1:10:24] textbook I got it from a revelation of
[1:10:27] God in my heart and now all I'm trying
[1:10:29] to do is what he was trying to do I'm
[1:10:31] trying the best I can to use the best
[1:10:33] means possible to explain to you the
[1:10:35] Revelation that's in my
[1:10:37] heart and when we stumble on our words
[1:10:39] yes will we use a scripture in a way
[1:10:41] that you don't think we should use it
[1:10:43] absolutely we'll do everything the
[1:10:44] prophet did when he tried to describe
[1:10:46] the
[1:10:49] revelation will we say things that sound
[1:10:51] odd will we stumble over our words will
[1:10:53] we misquote and mismanage even
[1:10:55] characters in The Bible absolutely
[1:10:58] that's not the point the point is what
[1:11:00] is the tape
[1:11:02] [Applause]
[1:11:03] saying
[1:11:05] God then say what the tape says and use
[1:11:09] any means possible to explain it but say
[1:11:12] what the tape
[1:11:14] says
[1:11:15] amen praise be to
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:19] God I hope that doesn't scare you but it
[1:11:23] Thrills me amen when a brother comes to
[1:11:26] the pulpit inspired he's got the vision
[1:11:28] and he goes to a scripture I never
[1:11:30] thought of and he uses it in a way I
[1:11:32] never imagined and he pulls the seven
[1:11:34] seal out of that my heart just soaring
[1:11:36] saying praise God I'm not saying you
[1:11:38] can't do
[1:11:41] that who says he can't do that he can do
[1:11:44] it amen why because he's saying what the
[1:11:46] tape says he caught the revelation of
[1:11:49] what what the prophet was trying to
[1:11:50] bring to
[1:11:52] us he said he says I hope you're
[1:11:54] catching
[1:11:56] what the spirit's been trying to get
[1:11:57] over without coming right out and saying
[1:12:03] it if he didn't come right out and say
[1:12:07] it how am I going to only say what's on
[1:12:10] the tapes to say what he wants us to
[1:12:12] catch but didn't come right out and say
[1:12:15] Amen you've given us an impossible
[1:12:19] task and brother R says you've got to
[1:12:21] read between the lines it's a love
[1:12:22] letter you catch it between the lines
[1:12:24] you have your Bibles open if you don't
[1:12:26] open your Bible open it anywhere don't
[1:12:29] turn to any Scripture just open your
[1:12:30] Bible right to the middle somewhere look
[1:12:32] down at your Bible and look between the
[1:12:38] lines what do you see between the
[1:12:41] line it's white you're looking at the
[1:12:44] white stone friend you're looking at the
[1:12:46] unwritten portion of the word you're
[1:12:48] looking what's in between the lines The
[1:12:50] Love Letter that's given to his bride he
[1:12:53] he put it between the lines and she
[1:12:55] knows it because she has a love
[1:12:57] relationship with him because she was
[1:12:59] part of him before the foundation of the
[1:13:01] world and through this Revelation she's
[1:13:03] reconnected with him in love with him
[1:13:05] the Capstone is love and now she's
[1:13:07] coming down and she can read what's in
[1:13:11] white what's not written at all she can
[1:13:14] read it and she can see
[1:13:17] it praise be to God we're reading the
[1:13:20] white stone all the time
[1:13:22] friends there's a great mystery that's
[1:13:25] has been veiled in this Bible that he's
[1:13:27] waited for this end time to bring and
[1:13:29] why did he do it because he wants us to
[1:13:32] rise above all the things of the world
[1:13:35] and be spiritually minded
[1:13:38] amen there's no way I'm going to
[1:13:42] finish but praise God we'll get back to
[1:13:46] it brother B
[1:13:49] says and this day the scripture is
[1:13:52] fulfilled said the next morning at 10:00

[1:15:41] else to
[1:15:43] come and do something
[1:15:45] else if Christ was fully
[1:15:48] revealed if the mystery of the whole
[1:15:50] Bible was open if the entire Bible was
[1:15:52] open what do we need somebody else to to
[1:15:55] come and do something else for to open
[1:15:57] up more of the Bible what part of the
[1:15:59] Bible's not been opened you open up the
[1:16:02] entire Bible to reveal Christ what part
[1:16:03] of Christ hasn't been
[1:16:06] revealed it was finished this is the end
[1:16:10] time shall be no more the finishing of

[1:16:46] was coming to unite with his bride to
[1:16:49] become one that's what was taking place
[1:16:53] at the sounding of the seven Thunders
[1:16:58] look at this look here at the date on
[1:17:01] this message the contest 1962 1231 this
[1:17:05] is the watch Night Service this is the
[1:17:07] next day after he preached sir is this

[1:17:34] that rock beneath the rock what's he
[1:17:37] talking about what's he talk what's the
[1:17:39] rock beneath the rock the night before
[1:17:41] he preached CES the time and talked
[1:17:43] about Junior Jackson's dream everybody
[1:17:45] in the room knew what he was talking
[1:17:47] about and he's saying he's coming at the
[1:17:49] watch Night Service at the end of 1962
[1:17:52] and he's praying to God for the coming
[1:17:53] year and he said oh open this year when
[1:17:56] in
[1:17:57] 1963 Open Lord the hidden Mana that rock
[1:18:01] beneath the rock what's the hidden Mana
[1:18:04] it's the revelation of the mystery of
[1:18:06] God which is Christ amen the revelation
[1:18:08] of Christ the rock beneath the rock
[1:18:10] listen that we might see the program of
[1:18:14] God what was the whole purpose so that
[1:18:16] you would understand God's whole program
[1:18:19] of Redemption where you come from how
[1:18:21] you got here what he's doing what he's
[1:18:23] been doing for the last seven Church
[1:18:25] what Christ came to do what you're here
[1:18:27] to do what he's going to finish up and
[1:18:29] how we're going to move on from here
[1:18:30] that we might see your
[1:18:33] program that's what he was hoping to be
[1:18:36] accomplished in
[1:18:39] 1963 and he would open this year Lord
[1:18:44] the hidden
[1:18:45] Mana that rock beneath the rock the
[1:18:48] white the revelation of the white
[1:18:50] stone that we might see the program of
[1:18:54] God right you realized the preaching of
[1:18:57] the seven Thunders was to bring the
[1:18:58] correct interpretation of the symbols of
[1:19:00] the seals not so that we would fixate on
[1:19:03] the symbols of seal there's Great Value
[1:19:05] in that amen but so that we would
[1:19:07] recognize the time marker that this is
[1:19:11] the seventh seal this is the coming of
[1:19:12] the Lord amen this is the uniting of the
[1:19:15] head and the body that we would
[1:19:16] recognize that the seven Thunders would
[1:19:18] bring us to the end
[1:19:20] time amen so that we would see the
[1:19:23] program of God now that's why these
[1:19:25] Mysteries loged the Seven Seals unlock
[1:19:27] the whole Bible because it unlocks
[1:19:29] everything once you know amen what God
[1:19:32] is doing and how he's doing it and how
[1:19:34] he's accomplishing what what was the
[1:19:36] great mystery of God the great mystery
[1:19:38] of God was Christ Christ is what the
[1:19:40] anointed word what anointed word it was

[1:19:44] was Christ in David it was Christ in
[1:19:46] Abraham it was Christ in Paul it was
[1:19:48] Christ in Peter and it's Christ in you
[1:19:50] and it's Christ in me that's his program
[1:19:53] that's the Great mystery that he wanted
[1:19:55] to reveal underneath these seals that's
[1:19:58] the White Rock that's the mystery of
[1:20:00] this book this book is all about God and
[1:20:03] all about Jesus Christ and all about
[1:20:05] Redemption amen but brother brandom come
[1:20:07] along and he began to preach amen and
[1:20:09] show us why it had to be blood why
[1:20:12] virgin birth what happened in the garden
[1:20:14] the mystery within the mystery why
[1:20:16] because his redeemed seed were on Earth
[1:20:18] and now he goes from predestination
[1:20:20] which others preach
[1:20:22] predestination that you were
[1:20:23] predestinated and he preached
[1:20:25] predestination the denomination's
[1:20:27] perspective was God looked out and he
[1:20:29] knew you would choose him he
[1:20:30] predestinated You by for knowledge amen
[1:20:32] that's God's predestination brother
[1:20:34] brandom come with the mystery Under The
[1:20:36] Rock and he says he predestinated you
[1:20:39] because you were in him in his mind
[1:20:41] before the foundation of the world it
[1:20:43] took it from the surface down to the
[1:20:45] depths of the mystery of the back of
[1:20:47] God's mind light had never shined on
[1:20:49] this before nobody else preached about a
[1:20:51] seed Gene
[1:20:53] [Applause]
[1:20:55] amen and the seed Gene brought the need
[1:20:58] for Redemption the seed Gene brought the
[1:21:00] need for the Holy Ghost the seed Gene
[1:21:02] amen needed the needed the New Birth the
[1:21:04] seed gen was
[1:21:08] predestinated amen open to
[1:21:12] us this
[1:21:14] year the hidden Mana that rock beneath
[1:21:18] the rock that we might see the program
[1:21:21] of God and then look where he goes to

[1:21:30] life Lord put the Capstone Christ Jesus
[1:21:34] upon each and every one of us may his
[1:21:37] great magnificent holy blessing be upon
[1:21:40] us

[1:21:45] hoping for in
[1:21:47] 1963 this is what God accomplished in
[1:21:49] 1963 and the last part is what he's
[1:21:52] accomplishing today amen the stature of
[1:21:55] a perfect man adoption bringing Sons and
[1:21:58] Daughters by the opening of the word
[1:22:00] into an adoption condition and what is
[1:22:03] an adoption condition oh praise God
[1:22:05] Almighty help me
[1:22:07] Lord we look at an adoption condition
[1:22:09] from an Earthly perspective and we say
[1:22:12] oh I'm lost and I'm Wayward and I want
[1:22:13] to be in the right position I want
[1:22:15] somebody to lift me up and connect me to
[1:22:17] God and we look at this adoption and we
[1:22:18] want God to pick us up and put us in a
[1:22:21] up on a pedestal and give us rights and
[1:22:23] privileges and honor and glory amen but
[1:22:25] adoption from God's perspective is
[1:22:27] totally different cuz remember God
[1:22:30] adoption was God's predestinated plan it
[1:22:32] was the mystery of his will remember
[1:22:35] we've been preaching on the mystery of
[1:22:36] his will that we would be adopted amen
[1:22:39] that he predestinated us unto the
[1:22:40] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:22:42] unto the good pleasure of his will so
[1:22:45] what was his predestinated plan to adopt
[1:22:47] us why did he want to adopt us because
[1:22:49] his desire was for himself to be made
[1:22:52] flesh on the earth and his children
[1:22:55] that's God's perspective on adoption
[1:22:57] adoption is to bring you to maturity so
[1:23:00] he can put the signant ring on you amen
[1:23:02] so he can give you the checkbook so you
[1:23:04] can be almost equal to your
[1:23:08] father so he can have a
[1:23:10] son that he can turn over the Millennium
[1:23:15] to Jesus Christ came to that
[1:23:18] place now Christ's bride has to come to
[1:23:22] that place
[1:23:25] so that he can turn over in adoption the
[1:23:28] whole creation to his son and his son's
[1:23:31] wife and God can go take his Millennial
[1:23:36] rest adoption is so much deeper than
[1:23:39] what we think adoption is it's God
[1:23:42] fulfilling his purpose his desire what
[1:23:46] he wanted what did God always want and
[1:23:49] what was robbed from him in the Garden
[1:23:50] of Eden he want an earth inhabited with
[1:23:53] sons and daughters of God that he could
[1:23:55] fellowship with and that would display
[1:23:57] his attributes in this
[1:24:00] manifestation adoption will bring that
[1:24:02] back
[1:24:04] amen so what are we going to what are
[1:24:06] the Seals supposed to do what's going to
[1:24:08] happen in
[1:24:10] 1963 open up this coming year the hidden
[1:24:15] Mana the secret portion of the bread the
[1:24:17] word Christ the hidden Mana the rock
[1:24:21] beneath the rock the hidden revelation
[1:24:25] that we might see the program of God and
[1:24:27] then cap off our
[1:24:30] lives
[1:24:32] adoption Lord put the
[1:24:34] Capstone Christ Jesus the headship the
[1:24:38] word upon each and every one of
[1:24:42] us that's what was supposed to be
[1:24:44] accomplished in
[1:24:47] 1963 I say God let it be accomplished in
[1:24:51] 2024 cap off our lives
[1:24:55] and put on us the Capstone of Jesus
[1:24:58] Christ that we might come into His very
[1:25:00] image and be him upon this Earth for his
[1:25:05] glory and let's all
[1:25:07] stand we're going to have to finish this
[1:25:09] some other
[1:25:10] time
[1:25:12] amen musicians if you could come and
[1:25:15] brother John if you make your way up
[1:25:16] let's just bow our head and
[1:25:18] pray dear heavenly father we thank you
[1:25:21] for this
[1:25:22] day God it seems almost
[1:25:26] impossible that human lips could speak
[1:25:29] of such things it's overwhelming when we
[1:25:32] stop and really think and consider Lord
[1:25:36] the mystery that's been veiled before
[1:25:37] the foundation of the world your mystery
[1:25:40] of yourself that was hidden inside

[1:25:47] us and by your grace you've quickened it
[1:25:50] to
[1:25:51] us we could never see it intellectually
[1:25:55] we can never come to it by
[1:25:57] study it's only possible because you
[1:26:00] predestinated us to it and you've drawn
[1:26:03] us yes God we can say in ourselves we're
[1:26:07] not
[1:26:08] worthy we're not worthy of this honor to
[1:26:11] even see these things we're not worthy
[1:26:14] father to be a partaker but oh we're so
[1:26:17] thankful that you chose us in Christ
[1:26:19] Jesus before the foundation of the
[1:26:22] world God I pray that you'd help us to
[1:26:24] put the right value on these
[1:26:27] Revelations that it are it's more than

[1:26:32] tangible thing that we can lay our hands
[1:26:34] to and may God may we put the right
[1:26:36] value to this Revelation may become the
[1:26:39] greatest thing in our whole
[1:26:41] life for God this is what you brought to
