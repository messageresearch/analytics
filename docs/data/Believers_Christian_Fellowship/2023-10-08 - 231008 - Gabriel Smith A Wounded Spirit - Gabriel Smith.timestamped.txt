[19:46] quiet Brother G we got a suit on this
[19:51] morning well we need to loosen that tie
[19:54] a little bit and right and so uh I just
[19:58] just uh I got a little something on my
[19:59] heart you know I I wondered about what
[20:02] what to bring it as far as a it's really
[20:05] kind of like a part two it's a it's a
[20:08] part two when I preached a couple weeks
[20:10] ago on uh on the works of God and then
[20:14] then uh kind of a part two for uh the
[20:17] young people when uh we uh we we
[20:21] preached the 5 to 12 years old on the on
[20:24] before and after and then it's kind of a
[20:26] part two for the for the Youth service
[20:28] when we preached on uh uh oh well we we
[20:33] we did uh here we go we did before and
[20:35] after with the 5 to 12 year olds there
[20:38] and and oh my look at that guy woo have
[20:42] mercy and uh you know God can do some
[20:45] amazing Transformations can he man
[20:50] Hallelujah and uh see that he he can
[20:52] there's some bad ones too
[20:55] there before marriage and after after
[20:59] marriage man now that's not just that's
[21:02] mine that was back it was mine back in
[21:04] the day and you know what then sometimes
[21:07] we we got the before and after Westwood
[21:09] Barbers there
[21:13] [Laughter]
[21:18] and amen so we had a good time at the 5
[21:21] to 12 years olds you know that and uh
[21:24] but but my point of it all was we had a
[21:28] before Retreat and then what are we
[21:29] going to be after Retreat I hope we all
[21:32] come back a little bit different you
[21:35] know a little bit closer to the Lord a
[21:37] little bit less of the world and a
[21:39] little bit less uh of our struggles and
[21:41] complexes and and you know speaking of
[21:44] complexes when we we uh spoke to the
[21:47] young people it was on the human grab
[21:49] bag and you know brother BR talked about
[21:51] the human grab bag is when he went to
[21:54] the doctor and had a stomach condition
[21:56] and you know he didn't really understand
[21:58] what was going on and that that um that
[22:02] that doctor told him well that's just
[22:03] out of the human grab bag you'd always
[22:07] have it and unfortunately that human
[22:09] grab bag gets passed around to all of us
[22:11] right we all get different things
[22:14] different struggles we wonder why in the
[22:15] world did I have to have this and uh you
[22:19] know and uh trying to bring to the young
[22:21] people uh something about the Lord Jesus
[22:24] because you know when you when you think
[22:26] about the Lord and all that he was you
[22:29] know when when he could you know he had
[22:32] first dibbin to pick whatever he wanted
[22:34] out of that human
[22:35] bag but the Bible says that uh there was
[22:39] no comeliness there was no form and
[22:41] there was no beauty that we should
[22:43] desire him that when when he uh walked
[22:48] the the the streets of Galilee and and
[22:52] Jerusalem that when you looked at him he
[22:55] he wasn't a big seven-footer and
[22:57] shoulders like barn doors and but there
[23:00] was no beauty that we could desire him
[23:02] he he didn't look like a preacher he
[23:04] didn't look like the King of Kings and
[23:05] the Lord of lords and you you think
[23:08] about the the character of God that
[23:10] whenever he would uh think about
[23:12] reaching into the grab bag that that he
[23:14] he would purposely say no I don't want
[23:17] no Splendor yeah amen no Majesty right
[23:22] uh in in matter of fact the Bible says
[23:25] that he would take upon himself the form
[23:28] of a servant when he would be found in
[23:31] fashion in the likeness of men that uh
[23:35] God in his great Majesty he would he
[23:37] would he would humble himself in such a
[23:40] way that that he wouldn't stack the deck
[23:43] in his
[23:44] favor right but but I I I wonder if if
[23:48] we this morning had that same
[23:50] opportunity how how would we stack the
[23:53] deck oh my I I you know I don't know
[23:57] about about you but but I'd be stacking
[23:59] the
[24:02] deck right right think about it I I mean
[24:06] you I would have shoulders like barn
[24:08] doors and you know I mean uh I I I i'
[24:12] had
[24:16] them
[24:19] this
[24:23] right right but but but the Lord he he
[24:27] he didn't he didn't he didn't choose
[24:29] that for himself when he when he very
[24:31] well could have been but but he wanted
[24:33] to feel every shortcoming and adequacy
[24:36] that that we H so that he could be the
[24:38] right kind of a mediator and and it lets
[24:41] us know that that that that whenever we
[24:43] have those type of shortcomings in our
[24:46] lives that that when we do have uh
[24:49] pulled something out of that human grab
[24:51] B and man I wish I could get another
[24:54] chanceen well well he's done walk that
[24:56] road too he knows all about it he he he
[24:59] knows what it feels like to to to suffer
[25:02] through life and to struggle through
[25:04] life and and so so thinking about those
[25:07] things I I I I just something you know I
[25:12] don't know to me this message means so
[25:14] much because when you when you look at
[25:16] it when we talk about Seven Seals and
[25:19] seven Thunders and and all those things
[25:21] those are those are great things but but
[25:24] to me just the the the the
[25:29] the understanding is one thing but I
[25:31] need to be able to apply it in my
[25:32] everyday
[25:34] life
[25:38] right understanding that you know
[25:40] brother Brandon part of his ministry was
[25:42] at seven seal and that that's wonderful
[25:44] and that's powerful to see him fulfill
[25:46] his portion but what about me where am I
[25:50] at in the economy of God and and if I am
[25:53] in that portion of being the elect of
[25:55] God then why do I feel the way that I
[25:57] feel why do I act the way that do I act
[26:01] sometimes why do I do the things that I
[26:03] do and and this message in this gospel
[26:07] gives me a great understanding of why I
[26:09] do the things that I do why did I act
[26:13] the way that I act sir and and and so
[26:17] the Bible tells us that that you know
[26:20] when God made the spirit of man that
[26:23] that it was you know man is built in
[26:25] such a way that that even in himself
[26:29] even without God he has a he has a great
[26:33] ability to sustain
[26:39] himself matter of fact if if if brother
[26:42] B tells us that that if if if you got
[26:44] just the right kind of an attitude you
[26:47] can almost retire a
[26:50] disease and and that's just in that
[26:52] second realm that if we can just have in
[26:56] our own spirit yeah have have the right
[26:59] kind of approach it'll cause a great
[27:02] change in our Liv but the but the
[27:05] problem of it is is sometimes we get
[27:08] wounded in our
[27:11] spirit and and this morning you know we
[27:16] we we can we can pick out the Sunday
[27:18] Best and make sure the tie matches the
[27:21] shirt and make sure the jacket matches
[27:24] the pants and hold this tie up and the
[27:26] children go now
[27:28] d right but but I wonder if we could all
[27:34] have eyesight to look a little deeper
[27:37] sir how many wounds in our spirit would
[27:40] we truly
[27:44] see you know uh we we we like to talk
[27:48] about how strong we are but you know
[27:51] even the Lord Jesus died of a broken
[27:53] heart amen is that right amen the
[27:57] prophet of God teaches us that and and
[28:00] told us that that that the Lord he had
[28:03] died of a broken heart with such grief
[28:06] of this world until a chemical reaction
[28:08] taking place in his body that could not
[28:11] take place in you you cannot suffer like
[28:14] that there's no way for you to have that
[28:17] kind of a grief but the Lord of lords
[28:19] and the King of Kings had the ability
[28:22] that he could pack that kind of grief so
[28:25] that he could suffer under the weight of
[28:27] sin
[28:28] so that we wouldn't have to
[28:32] suffer if we could somehow just tap into
[28:35] that on our everyday lives sometimes we
[28:38] lose sight of that sometimes life gets
[28:42] heavy sometimes life comes at us in such
[28:45] a way that we didn't expect it and you
[28:48] know sometimes we carry things for
[28:51] things sometimes we carry things for a
[28:53] whole lot longer than we really should
[28:56] that's right amen the the Bible tells us
[28:59] that that it says oh in Jeremiah 4:14 oh
[29:04] Jerusalem wash thine heart from
[29:07] wickedness that thou mayest be saved how
[29:11] long shall vain
[29:14] thoughts
[29:15] Lodge within thee amen and and when we
[29:19] think about this you know and brother
[29:22] brandham taught us the the that we are a
[29:25] Triune being and and that wasn't
[29:28] something new that he had he come up
[29:30] with the Bible plainly declares it and
[29:33] and matter of fact when when he when he
[29:35] talks about saying in that Spirit realm
[29:37] of of conscience memory reason
[29:40] imagination infection uh that that's
[29:43] something I I would uh presume that he
[29:45] got from Clarence
[29:47] Lin uh because Clarence Lin uh he was
[29:51] alive back in the 1800s and if you look
[29:54] at some of his writings and some of his
[29:56] teachings he had already had those
[29:57] things pinned out and but if you study
[29:59] the message brother brandham he'll use
[30:01] different uh terminologies such as
[30:04] conscience and Love and Desire and so
[30:06] forth and so but the point of it is is
[30:09] in that Spirit realm is our as the Bible
[30:12] tells us the seat of
[30:14] emotion and and a lot of times in life
[30:18] th those that realm is a realm that's
[30:21] not seen but it's a realm that affects
[30:24] us on a day-to-day basis on an hour hour
[30:27] basis on a minute to Minute by basis and
[30:30] a lot of times something that happened
[30:32] 20 30 40 50 years ago affects us yet
[30:36] this
[30:39] morning because we let those things
[30:44] large we let those things take
[30:49] residence come on friends that's right
[30:52] and and you
[30:55] know that's what I love about about this
[30:58] message because it helps me understand
[31:01] my
[31:03] Humanity it it helps me realize why I
[31:06] tick the way that I
[31:08] tick and and why I am the way that I am
[31:12] this message gives me a peace because
[31:16] when I feel a certain way you you you
[31:18] may feel that way but the word
[31:21] says right you you you you you you you
[31:24] may you may you may and and and
[31:26] sometimes
[31:28] we realize that it's all together lying
[31:31] vanities and it gives us a strength that
[31:34] we can deny those things and say no the
[31:37] but but God's word says I'm delivered no
[31:41] matter what my reasoning says God says
[31:45] I'm delivered I'm not acting those
[31:47] things out that's just in my spirit
[31:51] realm that's just my memory coming back
[31:54] to me that's just my imagination
[31:57] that's affecting me but God has changed
[32:00] me deeper than that and it gives me a
[32:03] faith to push that thing
[32:06] [Applause]
[32:07] aside when my imagination takes hold
[32:11] there ought to be something anchored
[32:12] deeper that takes even a stronger Hold
[32:15] That cast that thing down that's the
[32:18] whole point of a Christian friends
[32:20] that's what gives us the ability to push
[32:23] those things aside that this book just
[32:25] becomes more than a book but it becomes
[32:28] a reality in my
[32:32] life you
[32:35] know our our minds are so powerful and
[32:40] our
[32:41] Spirits are so
[32:44] strong that only the holy spirit is able
[32:48] to tame it yes sir am and you have to be
[32:52] willing to surrender that you have to be
[32:55] willing to allow the Holy Spirit to tame
[32:58] that thing you know brother brandham
[33:01] teaches us this he tells us he says he
[33:04] says you see you you you can say you see
[33:06] that there and you just keep saying yes
[33:09] I believe it and I believe it so much
[33:11] till actually you think you see it when
[33:16] you don't see that's right but that's
[33:19] psychology it's just got you so mentally
[33:22] pressed towards it till you just imagine
[33:26] it so imagine it so much till it
[33:30] becomes
[33:31] reality Lord you can just imagine now
[33:35] now I I want to stop there because and
[33:39] and I'm not preaching so much on
[33:41] somebody imagining are you imagining
[33:44] somebody hates you that's not what I
[33:45] want you to focus on but my point is our
[33:48] mind is so strong that we can imagine
[33:52] things that aren't real but they become
[33:54] reality in our mind yeah right amen it's
[33:59] not just the fact that that person don't
[34:01] what what they looked at me wrong
[34:04] or or or they didn't shake my hand and
[34:07] they
[34:10] shook amen right you know and and we
[34:13] would think well we should be farther
[34:14] along down the road than that brother
[34:16] gay but but that's not true because
[34:18] we're still in this house of
[34:20] Flesh and and we are still no matter if
[34:23] we're 49 59 69 79
[34:27] sometimes we're still that little 12y
[34:29] old boy or that 13y old girl that got
[34:34] picked
[34:36] on and because we we suffered such abuse
[34:41] or trauma at an early age it still plays
[34:46] a role and a part in our
[34:49] life you know you know the thing of it
[34:53] is trauma is something that's that's
[34:55] that's that's that that that's so uh
[34:58] overwhelming in our lives that that that
[35:01] only the Holy Spirit can help us and
[35:03] it's something that we have to be
[35:05] mindful of on a day-to-day basis amen
[35:08] because listen there's so many people
[35:10] here this morning not everyone of us
[35:13] lived under the shelter the umbrella of
[35:15] the revealed word of God and had a holy
[35:17] ghost filled mom and dad that watched
[35:19] over them every day of their lives and
[35:21] never let them you know go uh uh do
[35:24] sleepovers or never let them do this or
[35:26] never let them do that and they've
[35:28] always been watched over and you know
[35:30] never heard a raised voice
[35:33] and but some of us grew up in
[35:36] the well amen the other side of
[35:40] it and and so and so some of us got some
[35:44] scars that we deal
[35:47] with some of us got some trauma in our
[35:49] lives
[35:52] amen and those
[35:55] things
[35:57] those things still affect
[36:00] us sometimes on a day-to-day
[36:06] basis see cuz we get
[36:09] wounded in our
[36:12] spirit and those things take sometimes
[36:15] decades to
[36:20] heal right you know and you know what
[36:23] sometimes we can talk we can we can talk
[36:24] about Seven Seals and Prophets of God
[36:27] and denominations this and Antichrist
[36:29] that and but you know what that trauma
[36:31] is still right
[36:33] there that's right see that's but if you
[36:37] think about it that shows the beauty of
[36:39] God that in the midst of all of these
[36:41] deep Revelations God would anoint a
[36:44] prophet to to to to Branch off in
[36:47] certain areas to help us deal with those
[36:50] traumas in our
[36:51] life right to give us to give us Insight
[36:54] on how to handle those things because
[36:57] because and and I hope I hope you
[36:59] understand we can we can say seventh
[37:01] seal Redemption and and you know and and
[37:03] the plan of God and and and and and it's
[37:06] my Redemption I'm redeemed and all these
[37:08] different things but what about my
[37:11] spirit praise God what about this wound
[37:15] that I
[37:16] have you understand what I'm saying and
[37:19] I understand Redemption happens and and
[37:21] and and and and to see that God can step
[37:24] in and and transform us and change just
[37:27] but I don't know about you friends I
[37:29] know what God has done in my life and I
[37:31] know that I'm not what I used to be and
[37:33] I know that I'm not what I ought to be
[37:34] but thank the Lord I'm not what I was
[37:36] back then and all those things are true
[37:38] and those things are real but there's
[37:40] still trauma that raises
[37:48] up there's still wounds in our
[37:52] lives and I think Lord how am I going to
[37:54] go on am I the only one no
[37:57] am I the only one listen even in message
[38:00] homes sometimes as much as we as Parents
[38:03] try to shelter our children and protect
[38:05] them there's look even God himself
[38:09] couldn't totally protect his children in
[38:11] a garden called
[38:13] Eden how are we going to do it in
[38:15] Satan's
[38:16] Eden and so there has to be that ability
[38:19] friends where we well we can't smother
[38:22] our children in such a way but what we
[38:23] have to do is we have to understand
[38:25] where they're at and
[38:27] time and we have to allow them to be
[38:29] what they are sir and allow them to grow
[38:33] the way that they that God wants them to
[38:36] grow I don't know about you but I don't
[38:38] want to hinder my children as much as I
[38:40] want them to go a certain direction I
[38:42] don't want to put my hands on the wheel
[38:44] because God may have a different plan
[38:46] for their
[38:47] lives and we all have to be mindful of
[38:50] that our children do not come to this
[38:53] world Born Again
[38:55] amen right even though we've had family
[38:59] devotions even though we've had Sunday
[39:02] schools we've had youth meeting after
[39:05] youth meeting we've had all these
[39:07] different things there's still a portion
[39:09] of them friends they got to have their
[39:11] own
[39:13] birth and if they ain't had their own
[39:15] birth and you've got to give them space
[39:17] for
[39:17] Grace you have to allow them a space to
[39:21] repent and you have to intercede for
[39:23] them knowing that they are not held to
[39:26] your
[39:27] accountability because they don't have
[39:29] what you have right and so there has to
[39:32] be an ability within us to stand back
[39:36] and go
[39:40] God Lord please don't let me hinder them
[39:46] am let me be a
[39:48] help let me just be a
[39:53] blessing because a lot of times we get
[39:55] in way and we we think well you can't be
[39:59] doing that how's that going
[40:04] to oh it's time for me to take the
[40:06] jacket off in the tie and man I'm have
[40:09] to go find the khakis and the polo and
[40:13] man we F to have Retreat praise the Lord
[40:17] I don't know friend I you know I was so
[40:19] nervous
[40:20] today uh yeah I would woke up and I you
[40:24] know no matter how hard I try to put
[40:26] this thing together you know I love to
[40:29] teach and the Powerpoints and lay these
[40:32] things out and when I get up here it
[40:34] just goes
[40:34] [Music]
[40:37] up you know you try to pull it back in
[40:40] you try to reel it back in and
[40:42] you so I I hope I hope yall just labor
[40:47] with me and I trust that the something
[40:50] be said this morning that would be able
[40:52] to be a help to you because because we
[40:55] live in in Satan's Eden and it's the
[40:59] greatest battle that was ever
[41:01] fought and the greatest battle that's
[41:03] ever raging is not so much between you
[41:06] know Russia and America but right now
[41:09] it's right here this is where we battle
[41:12] this is where we struggle this is where
[41:15] we have this great fight that goes on in
[41:18] our minds and and a lot of times we we
[41:21] we we imagining things listen little
[41:24] children you you you as little ones
[41:28] don't just think this is for brother for
[41:30] the for Mom and Dad you little ones can
[41:33] imagine things in your
[41:36] mind you little ones can have have a a a
[41:40] uh maybe somebody on the playground or
[41:42] somebody maybe a cousin or whatever and
[41:45] say something about you and make fun of
[41:47] you and that thing can
[41:50] Lodge within your
[41:53] spirit that vain thought can rest there
[41:56] and you start imagining it you start
[41:58] thinking about it and if you ain't
[42:00] careful little one that thing will will
[42:02] start building and ruining you in in a
[42:06] way that that that clogs up the channels
[42:09] of God yeah amen listen the Bible says
[42:13] you're fearfully and wonderfully
[42:15] made but a lot of times we listen to to
[42:18] our our our friends and our Companions
[42:21] and and then you know when we get around
[42:22] the young ones and we get around our
[42:24] friends well well these are the cool

[42:31] popular right oh I remember that listen
[42:33] you know I I I I don't know if I said
[42:36] this before but I remember one back in

[42:41] kid that got picked on and uh and uh uh
[42:46] man I hated it they they they they used
[42:48] to make fun of me so hard I had these

[44:19] Derek and you know what I accepted that
[44:22] challenge I was tired of it
[44:26] and uh so here I am seventh grade and
[44:31] this is back in the day we didn't have
[44:32] video games we actually had to go to a
[44:35] room we had to go to a the
[44:38] arcade right so we go to this rain tree
[44:42] Plaza and everybody go to the arcade on
[44:44] Friday nights right so here I am seventh
[44:46] grade at the arcade and all of a sudden
[44:48] uh oh Mark shows
[44:50] up oh man well we we we go out we we go
[44:55] we go uh uh we I don't know how we got
[44:57] there but we go behind rain tree Plaza
[44:59] in this Factory parking lot we get in
[45:01] the
[45:02] fight oh man sister Joyce I put it on
[45:07] him I put it on him
[45:09] sister I did I don't know how I think I
[45:14] was just fighting for my life you
[45:16] know but boy I put it on
[45:19] him and you know instantly
[45:24] instantly now I had Street
[45:30] cring oh yeah I think my voice got
[45:33] deeper after I got done beating him up
[45:35] had little gravel at seventh grade you
[45:42] know but anyway so so I I I I we got in
[45:48] the fight I got I beat him up beat him
[45:50] real good and I I don't recommend that
[45:52] for children now please understand now
[45:54] little ones I was was not saved not
[45:56] serving the
[45:58] lord but anyways you know sometimes I
[46:01] wish sometimes I wish I would have got
[46:03] beaten up because I think man maybe my
[46:04] life a little bit different you
[46:07] know but
[46:08] anyways so what what I'm showing you is
[46:11] as I understand what it's like to go
[46:13] under that when you're constantly
[46:15] getting picked on and beat up and picked
[46:18] on and maybe you understand it it
[46:20] affects you it hurts you but you know
[46:23] what when I come back to school Monday
[46:25] morning
[46:26] boom I went from a from a zero to a
[46:30] hero right instant
[46:33] instantly I was one of the popular kids
[46:38] instantly but the problem of it is now I
[46:41] had to keep up the
[46:46] Persona see now I had to keep up the
[46:50] Persona and now I had to be something
[46:53] that I really
[46:54] wasn't and that started me on the wrong
[47:00] road yeah that's what I say I wish I
[47:03] wish man I think man maybe I maybe I
[47:05] still could have met my wife somehow
[47:07] through it all
[47:08] and i' have been a nerdy
[47:13] kid hello Susan we go out with me
[47:18] [Laughter]
[47:24] please
[47:27] you know it didn't happen that
[47:31] way little bow tie
[47:33] on what's going on with me
[47:41] please but but you know things happen
[47:43] the way that they do and we don't really
[47:45] understand why those things happen the
[47:47] way that they do but listen children the
[47:49] the the point of the matter is is when
[47:51] we go through life sometimes bad things
[47:54] happen to us but you you got to be
[47:56] careful that in the midst of all of that
[47:59] that you choose the right
[48:02] road because there's always these things
[48:04] set before us there's two different
[48:06] paths and there's no matter look you may
[48:08] have been baptized at 10 12 13 years old
[48:11] but listen remember every day of your
[48:13] life is a choice that same Choice is
[48:17] still set before you and you have to
[48:20] choose the right you say I've been born
[48:21] I don't doubt that a bit but listen
[48:23] sometimes we have to make the wrong
[48:25] choices and if we ain't careful that
[48:27] that wrong choice or that situation that
[48:30] happens a wound can come
[48:34] in in our
[48:36] imagination in our memory in our
[48:39] reasoning in our
[48:42] affection right right because that's the
[48:45] Battleground friends that's what we all
[48:47] deal with and and and and here's the
[48:50] thing those things happen to us and and
[48:54] nobody nobody
[48:56] knows the wounds that we
[48:58] carry and a lot of times because we are
[49:05] bride well we can't we have that same
[49:10] Persona just like just like here I was
[49:13] still look from Friday night to Monday
[49:16] morning I was still that same little
[49:18] short fat kid that got picked
[49:21] on even though my status
[49:24] changed nothing changed on the inside I
[49:28] still had those same insecurities I
[49:30] still had them same shortcomings and a
[49:33] lot of times we have that same thing
[49:34] happen to us is when we when we become
[49:38] when we when we're coming to the church
[49:40] and we're tore up and we're we're we're
[49:42] we're busted and broken but something
[49:44] happens to us and we get
[49:46] changed and everybody goes wow look at
[49:49] them they're real Christians and then we
[49:52] have this
[49:54] oh
[49:58] then we have the
[50:02] Persona God calls us into the ministry
[50:04] and
[50:08] oh but you know what listen
[50:11] listen that short little fat kid still
[50:14] in
[50:18] there it y'all know what I'm talking
[50:20] about friends and because we're message
[50:24] and we have this standard
[50:26] that we all are striving
[50:29] for but many times in our life we can't
[50:33] meet what we're striving for but because
[50:36] of our
[50:38] persona come on Friends y'all wasn't
[50:42] this tight at The
[50:44] Retreat look look you what what what
[50:46] what has changed from Retreat till now
[50:49] just a
[50:50] building but because of where we're at
[50:53] y'all has been tight y'all been tight
[50:56] the whole time where was y'all loose and
[50:59] happy and what what do we need to go
[51:02] home get some get some khakis and get
[51:05] some jeans and give brother Brian a
[51:07] t-shirt I mean my goodness said give him
[51:10] a t-shirt
[51:12] say huh come on Friends y'all know what
[51:16] I'm talking about what but what happened
[51:18] is it's because of where we're at but
[51:21] nothing we still have that same Spirit
[51:24] on the inside of us am that was at
[51:27] retreat but because of the
[51:31] Persona
[51:33] amise the Lord come on
[51:36] friends but the wounds is still
[51:39] there what we got to do is get get out
[51:42] of uh this this realm and this thinking
[51:46] and and this mold that we have this
[51:48] Persona being some tough guy we ain't
[51:50] tough ain't a one of us tough without
[51:53] the Holy Spirit ain't no one of Satan
[51:56] will chew us up and spit us out if it
[51:59] wasn't for the grace of God this morning
[52:02] every one of us would been on a drunk or
[52:05] or some kind of perversion or filth but
[52:08] it was the grace of God that kept your
[52:10] mind this weekend it was the grace of
[52:13] God that kept you off of that internet

[53:20] because he's done something for me yes
[53:23] he's done something he's changed me in
[53:24] such a way that I couldn't change myself
[53:27] he made me a new creation in Christ
[53:29] Jesus and he's helping me to deal with
[53:31] this old Spirit realm that raises up all
[53:36] the
[53:37] time my conscience my memory my
[53:42] reasoning yeah listen friend I'm a mess
[53:44] I'll be honest with you I'm a mess my
[53:49] imagination catches a ho
[53:52] sometimes and it just oh my
[53:55] my
[53:58] affection have
[54:00] mercy but there's something on the
[54:02] inside God gave me a faith amen God gave
[54:06] me an anchor deep down on the inside
[54:07] that when those things begin to rage and
[54:09] roll there's something that that gives
[54:11] me a peace cuz whenever that thing comes
[54:15] up it just
[54:17] something oh I don't need a iPad I don't
[54:20] need a Macbook I don't need a iPhone I
[54:22] ain't got to search nothing out there's
[54:24] just something on inside starts ringing
[54:27] it'll be a little
[54:28] scripture there that little ring in your
[54:31] heart and you go oh yes Lord that's
[54:33] exactly right yes that's exactly right
[54:37] see that's what it's all about to me
[54:39] friends I I
[54:42] I many
[54:44] times many
[54:47] times you know there's this there's this
[54:50] young girl brother brandom talked
[54:53] about she was she was like young 10 12 I
[54:56] don't know 13 years old and she had a
[54:59] murmuring in her
[55:00] heart and she said in that prayer
[55:04] line
[55:06] and had and and she had received her
[55:10] healing what was later on in life she
[55:13] had another heart
[55:19] problem she got with the wrong
[55:24] boy and brother bham tells us that that
[55:29] that boy left her married another but
[55:33] she still had that
[55:36] affection towards this
[55:39] boy she still had this imagination
[55:42] rolling the
[55:45] reasoning oh I know he's I know Johnny
[55:47] still loves
[55:50] me that affection was taken in that
[55:53] Spirit realm and she had got and so
[55:55] worked up in her mind brother Brenham
[55:58] says that she created a
[56:01] world and lived in it
[56:05] all by
[56:07] herself all by herself Johnny loves me I
[56:11] know he does he loves me someday he'll
[56:14] come back to me I know he
[56:17] will and so that tells
[56:20] us and shows us friends that there's and
[56:24] listen this ain't just for the little
[56:26] ones this ain't just for the teenagers I
[56:31] wonder I wonder how many of
[56:35] us create a
[56:40] world in this message because we take so
[56:43] much
[56:44] criticism following a man man follower
[56:47] you worship you know you understand what
[56:50] I'm saying you know all these different
[56:53] things going on and brother brandom said
[56:56] and you know he did this and he did that
[56:58] and we live we get bombarded by that
[57:01] from so many angles that if we ain't
[57:06] careful we will create a
[57:10] world we will create a bubble and it
[57:13] won't be the Holy Spirit bubble that we
[57:15] need it'll be our walls of security and
[57:19] safety yeah sir right be because it's
[57:24] easy for listen it's it is not hard to
[57:27] have your heart
[57:31] crushed by a Lov
[57:33] one by a person that's that that still
[57:36] sits in the congregation with
[57:42] you and then after you get
[57:45] crushed and your heart's in
[57:49] pieces and then he hey brother how you
[57:52] and you
[57:53] go hey brother how you
[58:00] doing hallu come on friends come on and
[58:04] you know what happens is we create a
[58:07] world and you know what happens oh we'll
[58:09] be nice we'll be nice but really we just
[58:12] have our Inner Circle yeah it's just our
[58:16] Inner Circle and you know what we love a
[58:19] big church cuz we can blend in give me a
[58:22] big church I don't want a little church
[58:24] I just want a H in and I want to hop out
[58:26] cuz then I can have my own
[58:30] little
[58:34] world I know this is I know this is
[58:36] hitting home friends but listen it's
[58:38] true yeah it's true friends because
[58:42] nobody wants to get hurt because we
[58:44] still may be that little 10-year-old
[58:48] girl that got picked on and now the
[58:53] sisters they
[58:59] listen you you
[59:01] know I just my my my children you look
[59:04] at all three of
[59:05] them especially especially sisters
[59:09] they're very self-conscious you know got
[59:12] to have the long
[59:16] hair then
[59:20] you like a Vidal
[59:23] Sassoon
[59:25] oh hello
[59:34] hello but you know brother Bram said you
[59:36] can let that get to
[59:38] you brother Bram said first thing you
[59:40] know get a little stuck up feeling about
[59:41] yourself yeah right oh come on now you
[59:46] Brothers ain't got no sh short hair
[59:47] y'all know what I'm talking about you
[59:48] Brothers keep quiet
[59:50] sisters amen come on I'm let me squeak
[59:54] it amen out of
[59:56] you thank you thank you brother Brian's
[59:58] like Amen brother you you got short hair
[1:00:00] like me brother you don't know what I'm
[1:00:01] talking
[1:00:07] about but now
[1:00:10] listen cuz all three of my children
[1:00:14] ain't a one of them ain't a one of them
[1:00:16] ever cut their
[1:00:19] hair
[1:00:22] well kind of
[1:00:25] one of them got some gum in at one time
[1:00:31] and and she was worried that dad was
[1:00:33] going to you know excommunicate her from
[1:00:35] the
[1:00:38] congregation and and so she cut it out
[1:00:41] but that was just a little piece you
[1:00:42] know I won't tell you who it is but it's
[1:00:45] not her birthday and she's the
[1:00:49] oldest and then
[1:00:52] uh and then uh Mina I can't remember
[1:00:56] what she did she had some scissors in
[1:00:57] her hand she cut a little something off
[1:00:59] you know
[1:01:00] whatever and I'm not Mak a lie to that
[1:01:03] but my point is ain't no one of them
[1:01:06] ever cut anything off nor has my
[1:01:11] wife but if you look at all of them my
[1:01:14] wife's hair had her
[1:01:18] shoulders and
[1:01:21] so as a sore
[1:01:23] spot
[1:01:25] in the spirit
[1:01:29] realm oh yeah oh she's had some
[1:01:33] preachers just look at her and just boy
[1:01:35] on see on the seat of the
[1:01:40] scornful right but in that Spirit
[1:01:44] realm in that reasoning in that
[1:01:48] imagination in that
[1:01:51] affection look all three of them Naomi
[1:01:54] Mina she she she's the middle one her
[1:01:56] hair down down to her
[1:01:58] knees right look at Anna she should have
[1:02:01] some Anna is right right in the middle
[1:02:03] of her back and so in my home I
[1:02:10] know I know what the sisters go through
[1:02:13] and a lot of times when we're in the
[1:02:15] congregation in the church is We compare
[1:02:18] ourselves by
[1:02:20] ourselves and that is so unwise friends
[1:02:23] because what it's because of our
[1:02:26] Persona it may not be how tough we are
[1:02:29] but it's look how
[1:02:31] [Music]
[1:02:33] long my
[1:02:39] glory right come on sis y'all know what
[1:02:42] I'm talking about right it
[1:02:43] happens see but but then we fail to
[1:02:46] [Laughter]
[1:02:49] realize but then we fail to realize the
[1:02:52] pain that goes with those things
[1:02:54] and if we ain't careful we'll we'll look
[1:02:57] in that Spirit realm we can let those
[1:03:00] things Lodge within
[1:03:03] us you may say brother Gabe listen those
[1:03:06] things that that little girl she was a
[1:03:08] little girl and you know that that but
[1:03:11] that don't affect me okay well hold
[1:03:13] on cuz I got one for
[1:03:18] you how many's ever read the story or
[1:03:21] heard brother Bram do his private
[1:03:23] interview on sister
[1:03:26] Bruce oh my if if uh if you have never
[1:03:32] heard of
[1:03:33] it uh or if you ain't listened to it for
[1:03:36] a long time you need to listen to it
[1:03:38] again amen cuz I was struggling this
[1:03:40] morning and I listen to it and oh it
[1:03:42] blessed me so much now if you think
[1:03:45] about this in the big picture in the big
[1:03:48] picture brother brandom's getting ready
[1:03:50] to preach
[1:03:53] masterpiece now think about the
[1:03:56] setting and think about how mindful God
[1:03:59] is yeah because this is this interview
[1:04:02] is actually conducted when brother
[1:04:04] bram's getting ready to preach
[1:04:06] Masterpiece he's he's getting ready to
[1:04:08] talk about how there's going to be
[1:04:10] another Masterpiece in this last
[1:04:13] day right and here he is
[1:04:19] interviewing a
[1:04:21] church amen
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:27] amen and and it's so powerful because in
[1:04:31] the middle of that interview they're
[1:04:33] singing about the
[1:04:36] blood I think it's there's power in the
[1:04:39] blood and and and then after they get
[1:04:42] done singing that the congregation gets
[1:04:44] quiet and then brother bam starts
[1:04:45] whispering and I'm thinking oh that's so
[1:04:47] beautiful just loved it but the thing of
[1:04:50] the but but what I want you to want to
[1:04:52] catch on this is that that of all of the
[1:04:55] thousands of interviews that prophet of
[1:04:58] God did there's only one recorded that
[1:05:02] we know of yeah only one
[1:05:09] amen and it's right before he preaches
[1:05:14] Masterpiece amen praise the Lord the
[1:05:17] little ding that made it the
[1:05:21] Masterpiece
[1:05:23] right and and as he's preaching getting
[1:05:26] ready to preach that there's a sister
[1:05:29] Bruce and she's in a in a having a
[1:05:32] private interview and during that
[1:05:35] private interview what is she worried
[1:05:38] about I've never had experience with the
[1:05:41] Holy
[1:05:48] Spirit and as she's pouring out her
[1:05:51] heart she's trembling you can oh you
[1:05:53] feel so sorry for her and brother
[1:05:55] Brandon just so gentle and sweet and and
[1:05:58] he says some of the most beautiful
[1:06:00] things to her he says sister he says
[1:06:04] listen you're a makeup and I'm
[1:06:06] paraphrasing but you can hear it he goes
[1:06:08] you're a makeup and and you get somebody
[1:06:11] on your heart that you that you want to
[1:06:13] pray for and you just can't get it off
[1:06:14] your heart he says you're just that kind
[1:06:17] of a way nervous type of person and he
[1:06:19] goes and he goes and he goes sister he
[1:06:21] goes listen you are a real
[1:06:26] Christian and she's yeah but brother
[1:06:28] brother and she sitting there you know
[1:06:30] you know brother B but I make so many
[1:06:31] mistakes and he goes
[1:06:35] sister I've I've seen your life under
[1:06:43] Vision oh wouldn't you love to have the
[1:06:45] prophet of God tell you that yes sir and
[1:06:47] afterward she still arguing yeah but
[1:06:52] I that's the same way we do go God will
[1:06:56] preach a message one day and you oh
[1:06:58] hallelujah
[1:07:00] oh right you's got to preach another one
[1:07:04] oh
[1:07:06] right and he says he says sister I've
[1:07:08] seen your life under vision and if
[1:07:11] there's anything against you God has hid
[1:07:14] it from me so so when we think about Des
[1:07:18] what I'm what I want you to understand
[1:07:19] is this is an elect lady amen amen right
[1:07:24] as an example for us when we're in the
[1:07:28] greatest battle that's ever fought God
[1:07:31] has a recording for us to go back to and
[1:07:35] listen when we go through those
[1:07:37] struggles God I made a mistake I did
[1:07:39] this I did that I
[1:07:41] don't but but did you search out your
[1:07:45] life did you make that thing well yes I
[1:07:47] made that right okay then the blood of
[1:07:49] Jesus yeah but no no no no no no no
[1:07:55] yeah on
[1:07:57] Amen if you confessed and you repented
[1:08:01] you went back you made it right listen
[1:08:03] you don't have to do no
[1:08:04] obedience yeah right
[1:08:09] amen that is your spirit realm telling
[1:08:11] you to do them
[1:08:13] obedience yeah that's
[1:08:16] right you know you know I used to work
[1:08:18] with a man a Salesman he was a Catholic
[1:08:21] you know what he told me one day he said
[1:08:23] he said he said gab he said you know
[1:08:24] Catholicism is mainly guilt
[1:08:29] amen and when he said that it's always
[1:08:32] stuck with me cuz I thought man how why
[1:08:34] would you want to be
[1:08:37] a c Catholic
[1:08:42] anyways right why would you want to
[1:08:45] serve a God that's mainly guilt on
[1:08:52] now
[1:08:54] and and if we would if we would be
[1:08:56] honest with ourselves a lot of times we
[1:08:58] struggle with them same things like we
[1:09:00] got to do some kind of penance to make
[1:09:02] it
[1:09:04] right but if you would be honest with
[1:09:06] yourself that's just your nature and
[1:09:09] this message came for you to look at
[1:09:11] your nature and separate it and go no
[1:09:14] that does me no good God sees no glory
[1:09:17] in you doing a be you that's right he
[1:09:19] sees no glory in you taking a cat of
[1:09:22] nine tails and thrashing your back and
[1:09:24] walking up and down stairs on your knees
[1:09:26] and all that God don't look at that go
[1:09:28] that's my
[1:09:31] boy right no friends but a lot of times
[1:09:34] we do that in our
[1:09:36] spirit
[1:09:38] realm we we beat our own selves up and
[1:09:42] there is no reason for it when you meet
[1:09:46] God's
[1:09:47] requirements you have to rest in that
[1:09:50] fact that God requires nothing
[1:09:54] else when you repent and you go make
[1:09:57] that right to that person you're like
[1:09:58] brother I'm so sorry I made a mistake
[1:10:00] man I I did I messed up and he that's
[1:10:03] okay brother it's all right no problem
[1:10:05] and then you walk away and you're like
[1:10:07] man I probably should have said a little
[1:10:08] bit differently I should
[1:10:11] have no that's when you got to realize
[1:10:15] wait a minute that's my conscience
[1:10:16] that's my real that's me that's look how
[1:10:20] many times do you go you tell your
[1:10:22] children you go you know how I am
[1:10:25] oh none of
[1:10:27] you
[1:10:29] wow but you know more more is like I
[1:10:32] didn't talk to brother Chad brother Chad
[1:10:34] I know you going to be way but why don't
[1:10:35] you just let all of them I stand here I
[1:10:37] sit here and they can stand up and they
[1:10:39] can all have five minutes they preach to
[1:10:41] me man I
[1:10:45] [Laughter]
[1:10:50] just but but when but when we go go
[1:10:54] through life friends we have to be
[1:10:56] mindful of our
[1:10:59] weaknesses and whatever that is then you
[1:11:01] have to be mindful that that is just you
[1:11:04] and then set it
[1:11:06] aside because no matter look we that is
[1:11:10] just out of the human grab bag and
[1:11:12] there's a portion of and listen though
[1:11:15] though sister Bruce had that that that
[1:11:17] maybe that insecurities and she worried
[1:11:19] and stressed but God allowed that to
[1:11:21] happen why because she could inter for
[1:11:24] somebody and really intercede cuz she
[1:11:26] didn't do it half-heartedly she put
[1:11:27] everything into it and God used that
[1:11:31] Frailty in that weakness because he
[1:11:33] wanted a prayer Warrior right amen prise
[1:11:37] God and so if we would really look at
[1:11:39] our weaknesses and go no when I because
[1:11:42] the Bible says when I am
[1:11:45] weak he is oh thank you sister Karen he
[1:11:48] is strong that's exactly right yes in my
[1:11:52] weaknesses
[1:11:54] his strength is
[1:11:55] made perfect yes that's exactly right
[1:11:59] but a lot of times we don't look into
[1:12:01] the mirror of God's word we look
[1:12:13] into and in our
[1:12:16] mind we start working things up
[1:12:20] yeah and we see things that's not
[1:12:25] reality yes sir that's right and then
[1:12:28] what happens what then we then we pull
[1:12:32] off and we start to isolate
[1:12:35] ourselves because of our
[1:12:38] insecurities because of our listen
[1:12:40] friends every one of us look in that
[1:12:43] mirror and see something that's
[1:12:46] exaggerated
[1:12:49] right we all somehow look and we see
[1:12:53] something that we don't like and
[1:12:54] whatever we don't like about ourselves
[1:12:56] it's this great big
[1:12:59] right right but in reality really is it
[1:13:03] no because
[1:13:05] everyone every one of us is dealing with
[1:13:07] the same insecurities whether it be
[1:13:10] different ways we all got shortcomings
[1:13:12] and we all have things we struggle with
[1:13:14] and what we have to do is not look at
[1:13:16] that mirror but we have to look at the
[1:13:19] mirror of God's word that mirror is that
[1:13:22] is that not what the Bible tells us it
[1:13:24] is a mirror and when we look at I I I
[1:13:27] was you know I was witnessing to a man
[1:13:29] at work
[1:13:31] Friday and uh and uh and he was like
[1:13:33] yeah he's like you know and man he was
[1:13:35] just eating it up we like 45 minutes I'm
[1:13:37] thinking man I need to get back to work
[1:13:38] I'm thinking oh goodness I felt bad
[1:13:40] afterwards cuz we talked so long but he
[1:13:42] just he had me captive you know and and
[1:13:45] so I thought Lord I don't know should I
[1:13:46] work an hour over to make this up
[1:13:51] I but uh but but but but he but he asked
[1:13:55] me said what what what's what version is
[1:14:01] right I said I told him what the prophet
[1:14:04] said I said what the King James the most
[1:14:06] tried and
[1:14:07] true he said yeah I said but how do you
[1:14:10] know I said I tell you how I
[1:14:13] know I said cuz when I look in here and
[1:14:16] I say and I see David and I look at his
[1:14:21] life I say that's me
[1:14:26] right am when I look at the thief on the
[1:14:31] cross I don't I don't I don't I don't
[1:14:33] need to see any Greek Hebrew I don't
[1:14:36] need to see any I don't need to read the
[1:14:38] emphatic diaglot to make sure that
[1:14:40] matches up and I don't need to get a
[1:14:42] copy of the Dead Sea Scrolls because
[1:14:44] when I see that thief on the cross I go
[1:14:47] and that's
[1:14:48] me and and and you know I know brother
[1:14:51] brandom said that about the about the
[1:14:52] little boy that seen in the mirror and
[1:14:53] he says mama that's me but whenever I
[1:14:56] hear that
[1:14:57] story I look at that and I go well
[1:14:59] that's me amen right and and it becomes
[1:15:03] more than just what brother Brenham said
[1:15:05] a quote in the very depths of my heart I
[1:15:09] can't explain it but when I see God's
[1:15:12] word open I look at it and I go well
[1:15:14] that's
[1:15:15] me when when I when I when I see these
[1:15:18] stories and these Parables and I see
[1:15:20] these scriptures come to life in my life
[1:15:22] I go that's me that that's how I know
[1:15:27] this book is true that's listen people
[1:15:30] people can be critical with brother
[1:15:31] brandom and you know and talk about he
[1:15:33] did this he did this wrong he did that
[1:15:35] wrong and this and then and then you
[1:15:37] know you you got brothers that want to
[1:15:39] defend him in all these different things
[1:15:41] and to me listen I don't need to defend
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:46] nothing I I if somebody wants to be
[1:15:49] critical let them be critical I pray for
[1:15:52] them and say you know what but hey it's
[1:15:54] the grace of God that I see what I
[1:15:58] see listen God sent brother brandham to
[1:16:03] me and and brother brandham is my
[1:16:07] Prophet Jesus Christ is my God God sent
[1:16:11] William brandom to me and and if God
[1:16:15] didn't send William brandham to anybody
[1:16:17] else I can't help that the only thing I
[1:16:20] can say is that God sent that prophet to
[1:16:24] me he did behold
[1:16:28] I
[1:16:30] send you Elijah now people may say no
[1:16:35] that didn't say William Bram yes it
[1:16:39] did that's right you show me another man
[1:16:44] that that that meets the Elijah
[1:16:47] description I I ain't found
[1:16:50] one that his life so perfect L I don't
[1:16:54] know how to explain it friends all I
[1:16:56] know is it's a reality in my life and as
[1:17:00] I feed upon this word my life has
[1:17:05] changed and he changes me in such a way
[1:17:08] that I can't get past it and I if I
[1:17:12] would you know I I don't even understand
[1:17:14] how people can walk in this message and
[1:17:16] then deny it and then look at the Bible
[1:17:18] and then what do you do with
[1:17:22] Ruth
[1:17:23] right I
[1:17:25] mean what what do you what do you what
[1:17:29] do you do with Elijah I mean where do
[1:17:31] you where do you put him at I mean do
[1:17:34] you just leave him aside and don't talk
[1:17:36] about him I mean I mean how much of the
[1:17:38] Bible do you have to put aside when you
[1:17:40] walk away from the message and where
[1:17:43] where where do you how do you type and I
[1:17:47] mean you know you understand I'm saying
[1:17:49] I mean how do you read the Bible and
[1:17:51] then just leave all the principles
[1:17:53] that that that I mean I understand that
[1:17:55] eyes are blinded in things but you
[1:17:57] understand what I'm saying when I look
[1:17:58] at the Bible I think how in the world
[1:18:01] there's no way that one man can can take
[1:18:04] this Bible and lay out principles that
[1:18:07] go from Genesis to Revelation and that
[1:18:09] are
[1:18:11] unfailing you you take what brother
[1:18:13] brandham said about John when when when
[1:18:16] John brother B said John was a
[1:18:18] reflection of that Eagle right when you
[1:18:21] take I I I've done a study on this and
[1:18:24] uh and uh and I don't know I I I shared
[1:18:27] it one time with the with the young
[1:18:28] people at at Sunday school but you take
[1:18:30] the Book of John yes sir and you you you
[1:18:34] you pull out all of the Gospel stories
[1:18:38] that only speak of John yeah until you
[1:18:42] look at brother you know but when John
[1:18:44] when John was walking with Jesus he sees
[1:18:47] the very first miracle ever
[1:18:49] done water turned into wine do you you
[1:18:53] know no other disciple wrote about
[1:18:57] that but John being the eagle when he
[1:19:00] saw that that captivated
[1:19:03] him because we as Eagles see this water
[1:19:07] made wine amen and he would catch the
[1:19:10] first miracle yeah I mean when you look
[1:19:14] when you you know when he talk about the
[1:19:15] woman at the well do you know John was
[1:19:17] the only one that writes about
[1:19:18] her but he would have to yeah because
[1:19:22] who was that a reflection of the Bride
[1:19:25] of Jesus Christ and so John would be the
[1:19:28] one that catched those things and so
[1:19:30] when you read the book of John and you
[1:19:32] see everything that he pulled whereas
[1:19:35] Matthew Mark and Luke was right beside
[1:19:38] him when it
[1:19:40] unfolded and Matthew is you
[1:19:45] know Luke you know he's looking at the
[1:19:48] book but John's like
[1:19:51] wow but it's because of his anointing
[1:19:53] that he would be able to pick those
[1:19:55] things up and catch those things now and
[1:19:59] and it's a beautiful study uh uh when
[1:20:03] you look at it if you ever get time it's
[1:20:05] really easy to do but just just grab
[1:20:07] every story that only John speaks of and
[1:20:10] when you do it is an absolute Picture
[1:20:15] Perfect reflection of this last day amen
[1:20:19] praise God Amen now
[1:20:23] by God's grace you could see that with
[1:20:25] one
[1:20:27] book you get critical brother brand did
[1:20:30] all this and birthday here I don't know
[1:20:33] all these different things whatever but
[1:20:36] how what do you do with that where do
[1:20:38] you where do you make that fit and go
[1:20:41] well it was a
[1:20:43] coincidence okay well what about the
[1:20:45] other 65 books that go with it I mean
[1:20:50] you understand what I'm saying and so
[1:20:51] when people do these things things you
[1:20:53] know what it is friends it's the grace
[1:20:57] of
[1:21:00] God because to me the Bible it is so
[1:21:04] plain amen but we should
[1:21:07] never
[1:21:09] ever ever take it for
[1:21:13] granted because for what we
[1:21:15] see it's God's mercy that he anointed
[1:21:20] our
[1:21:21] eyes with an eyes have that we could
[1:21:25] have eagle eyes that when it's the
[1:21:27] darkest and the blackest we could
[1:21:30] actually see light when when when it
[1:21:33] when it when it's gross darkness and
[1:21:35] there's no
[1:21:37] love we can't help but to put our arm
[1:21:40] around somebody and say I love you buddy
[1:21:42] I love you there just a joy and a warmth
[1:21:45] listen I I you know ain't it so
[1:21:47] beautiful to love your enemies yes sir
[1:21:50] you know you know you know man can't do
[1:21:52] that
[1:21:53] but but whenever you can look at
[1:21:54] somebody that would disagree with you
[1:21:56] bitterly you can still have a you you
[1:21:58] still have a oh brother you just you
[1:22:00] want to you want to hug their neck and
[1:22:02] be like listen I've been there I know
[1:22:04] what that bitterness does I know what
[1:22:06] that anger does I know what that is God
[1:22:09] bring
[1:22:10] Deliverance you know why cuz you don't
[1:22:12] matter no more amen
[1:22:16] right and that's the beauty of it
[1:22:19] because the only person that matters is
[1:22:21] Jesus Christ he's the only one that's
[1:22:23] important nobody matters but
[1:22:28] him oh my that's right Hallelujah
[1:22:33] you
[1:22:36] my
[1:22:38] 12:15

[1:24:43] discredit you know the the depth of
[1:24:46] God's word and the inexhaustable of it
[1:24:49] but to me
[1:24:50] friends that does does no good if we're
[1:24:53] still sitting here
[1:24:55] wounded you understand what I'm saying
[1:24:57] it does no good if if we if we come into
[1:25:00] the church want to hear the message and
[1:25:02] then we bolt out as fast as we can so we
[1:25:04] don't
[1:25:08] get because remember listen are you

[1:25:36] yourselves listen today is the day where
[1:25:40] you be honest with yourself and go Lord
[1:25:42] wait a minute wait a minute I didn't
[1:25:44] have that attitude at retreat but some
[1:25:46] OD reason it's coming
[1:25:50] back lord what why do do I act that way
[1:25:54] why am I feeling that way why do I let
[1:25:57] those why do I let
[1:26:00] those
[1:26:01] uh memories affect me in such a
[1:26:07] way cuz I I
[1:26:10] believe I believe that no matter what
[1:26:13] you struggle with in life the Lord Jesus
[1:26:16] can set you free from
[1:26:19] it I I don't care how hard life you've
[1:26:23] had listen you say I've been abused you
[1:26:27] you may have been abused in ways
[1:26:30] unimaginable but God can take that and
[1:26:33] set you free from
[1:26:34] it he can give you a peace and a love
[1:26:38] that needs to be in place of whatever
[1:26:40] thing that you're carrying and
[1:26:42] packing I I and I listen I you know
[1:26:46] sometimes I I I'll be in the I'll be in
[1:26:48] the church and see a family look all
[1:26:51] sweet and perfect and I think
[1:26:54] man why in the
[1:26:57] world I wish I could have had that I see
[1:27:00] these children I see them all so
[1:27:03] innocent you know what I mean got that
[1:27:06] clean look about just just look just
[1:27:08] wide as the snow you you just want to
[1:27:11] watch over them you know what I mean
[1:27:12] protect them make sure you know what I
[1:27:13] mean just want to keep an eye on them
[1:27:16] and I look at that and I cuz I look at
[1:27:18] it I'm like it's the Envy like sister
[1:27:21] meia had for brother when he held the
[1:27:22] baby you know what I mean little envious
[1:27:25] you know think man love to have that
[1:27:27] love to have had that but I can tell you
[1:27:29] one thing that even
[1:27:32] though portions of my life have been
[1:27:35] robbed from
[1:27:36] me God has Place something in its place
[1:27:39] of that
[1:27:42] robbery that that will that that gives
[1:27:46] me a
[1:27:48] satisfaction and it gives me an
[1:27:50] assurance it it gives matter of fact it
[1:27:54] gives me a courage and and a peace that
[1:27:57] I can share it with you
[1:28:00] unashamedly and and the reason and and
[1:28:02] and the reason is because I got peace on
[1:28:04] it because all of us go through these
[1:28:07] things but you know the what what it is
[1:28:10] is a lot of times we we let that thing
[1:28:14] actually keep us in
[1:28:15] prison because of Pride that's right but
[1:28:18] but whenever you really look at that
[1:28:21] thing whatever it is
[1:28:22] and you get Deliverance then it gives
[1:28:24] you a freedom where you can actually
[1:28:26] testify of it and go you know what and
[1:28:28] be the worst thing ever and go this is
[1:28:30] what happened to me but God Set Me
[1:28:34] Free right not that you brag on it not
[1:28:37] that you glorify it but you go well well
[1:28:39] well I know well maybe you're not with
[1:28:41] this is how bad it was for me and then
[1:28:42] God did this for me and now there's
[1:28:45] Deliverance now there's Freedom now
[1:28:48] there's joy when I had pain and hurt and
[1:28:52] anger and strife but God has Set Me
[1:28:56] Free there is there is a reality in this
[1:29:00] gospel that is that is something that
[1:29:03] Hollywood will never touch because it's
[1:29:05] a it's a supernatural reality that gives
[1:29:08] you peace and courage it makes you a
[1:29:11] lion it makes you bold it makes you calm
[1:29:14] it makes you peaceful it makes you sweet
[1:29:17] it makes you humble it it makes you it
[1:29:20] makes you a warrior and yet
[1:29:23] and yet you're you're gentle and you you
[1:29:27] understand what I'm saying am I even
[1:29:28] making sense in all this what is it it's
[1:29:30] the gospel it's what the lovely one has
[1:29:33] done for
[1:29:34] me he has changed me in such a way that
[1:29:38] gives me I'm just telling you how the
[1:29:39] candle got lick I hope that's okay but
[1:29:41] he has changed me in such a way you know
[1:29:43] you think you think I was in drugs I was
[1:29:45] in alcohol but listen I tell you what
[1:29:47] the past six seven years brother I was
[1:29:50] in some of the darkest places I've ever
[1:29:53] been I mean and and so I I know I know
[1:29:58] what it's like to sit in a message Pew
[1:30:02] and be
[1:30:06] miserable I know what it's
[1:30:08] like to hear the prophet and though you
[1:30:12] can hear him it's it's and though you
[1:30:14] you know it's true it's not ringing in
[1:30:17] your heart cuz there's a cloud of
[1:30:19] Darkness over you not that you deny the
[1:30:23] message but you feel like the message
[1:30:25] denied
[1:30:27] you
[1:30:29] sir where you thank God I know it's real
[1:30:33] but is it real for
[1:30:37] me I'm talking about Blackness I'm
[1:30:40] talking about Blackness where you think
[1:30:41] the only reason why I'm I'm up and going
[1:30:44] is because I I would see you ever ever
[1:30:47] see a picture of of little
[1:30:49] birdies Little Birdies new newborn babes
[1:30:52] and they got their mouths up ch ch ch
[1:30:55] ch you know how many
[1:30:57] years I had that imagery in my
[1:31:01] mind and and and the guys would be
[1:31:03] working they' be like man you working
[1:31:04] overtime what are you doing and I tell
[1:31:06] them you know you ever see them little
[1:31:09] birdies with their mouths open ch ch he
[1:31:13] go they go yeah like they don't know
[1:31:15] what that food comes from all they know
[1:31:19] is they're
[1:31:20] hungry and they look at me kind of
[1:31:24] funny
[1:31:27] okay but that's what got me through I
[1:31:33] thought in my mind neither did Ne
[1:31:36] needless did I know it wasn't but the
[1:31:38] tender hand of Jehovah carrying me the
[1:31:41] whole time but what I'm telling you
[1:31:43] friends you may be in that position
[1:31:46] where it may not be Little Birdies but
[1:31:48] you feel like the reason why I'm here is
[1:31:50] because my family and I'm this and I
[1:31:53] feel like this and that and nobody likes
[1:31:55] me nobody and you know what's all you're
[1:31:58] doing building walls isolating yourself
[1:32:02] insulating yourself nobody understands
[1:32:05] well listen I promise you there is one
[1:32:07] that does and I'm trying to share with
[1:32:10] you just a little bit of what I've been
[1:32:12] through so maybe you can understand oh
[1:32:14] yeah I've been there too or brother Gabe
[1:32:17] I'm right there right now but listen
[1:32:20] there's hope amen amen all I all I say
[1:32:23] friends is look
[1:32:25] just one
[1:32:27] step all you have to do is say I
[1:32:31] can I
[1:32:33] will I
[1:32:34] do
[1:32:36] believe I can I
[1:32:40] will just keep
[1:32:43] walking listen you all them conscious
[1:32:46] you got to be mindful cuz at the end of
[1:32:49] it when I was was I when I was you know
[1:32:51] know 5 years ago four years ago I didn't
[1:32:54] have an orange jumpsuit on nothing like
[1:32:55] that
[1:32:57] but you had to go back a few more years
[1:33:01] I whole another
[1:33:06] story but but but even though when my
[1:33:11] conscience my memory my reasoning my
[1:33:14] imagination was telling me this is not
[1:33:17] for you God hates
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:22] matter of fact you know I I I would
[1:33:23] think I said I'm just here I don't even
[1:33:26] know why I'm here God I my children I
[1:33:29] don't want to be a bad example but I
[1:33:31] don't I don't I don't I
[1:33:34] don't I I literally felt like an
[1:33:38] orphan and what is an orphan is when
[1:33:41] your your daddy and Mama's
[1:33:44] dead you was abandoned and you think
[1:33:48] sometimes we have those things but you
[1:33:49] know what that didn't have nothing to do
[1:33:51] with the faith that was down there
[1:33:53] that's
[1:33:54] right but listen friends I didn't get
[1:33:57] born again when I came into this church
[1:33:59] I already
[1:34:01] was amen but what I'm saying is as we go
[1:34:04] through dark times in life sometimes
[1:34:07] it's really really
[1:34:09] black sometimes it's really really dark
[1:34:13] sometimes we look in the mirror and we
[1:34:15] get things worked up in our minds
[1:34:17] sometimes we imagine things and Things
[1:34:19] become so real but there's no truth to
[1:34:22] it it's just you that's doing it
[1:34:29] right if you could just be honest with
