[0:00] this world is destined for destruction
[0:03] America cannot rise again she failed to
[0:06] turn at her turning point in 1956 and
[0:09] now she cannot write raise again and now
[0:12] it God has permitted another agency to
[0:14] control and now it's time for us not to
[0:17] fight the government not to fight the
[0:19] systems they're going to continue to get
[0:21] worse
[0:23] but it's to stand and the face of it all
[0:27] and whenever given the opportunity to
[0:29] stand for the word I can't do that
[0:31] because the Bible says I can't do that
[0:33] because the Bible says I won't do that
[0:36] because the word of God says that's what
[0:39] we're here for to prove to Satan that we
[0:41] do believe he is the same yesterday
[0:43] today and forever if it was wrong
[0:45] yesterday it's wrong today it'll be
[0:47] wrong forever that God's not changing
[0:49] his mind about his word it doesn't
[0:51] matter how far along the culture goes
[0:54] amen I'm not moving with the culture I'm
[0:57] staying with the word
[0:59] and just because everybody else says
[1:01] it's right doesn't make it right amen
[1:03] years ago we talked about the
[1:04] progression of immorality and the
[1:06] denominational church because the
[1:08] denominational system as long as they're
[1:10] not as bad as the world feel okay
[1:13] they're right so you look at the
[1:15] churches whatever they were
[1:18] 50 years ago is a drastic difference of
[1:21] what they are now there are some
[1:22] denominations that would not allow their
[1:24] women to wear pants just a hundred years
[1:26] ago
[1:29] some of the denominations now that will
[1:31] permit same-sex marriage wouldn't let
[1:33] their women wear pants
[1:36] or earrings or makeup
[1:39] and in a hundred years they've gone from
[1:42] not allowing the women Amen to dress
[1:44] like a man wear makeup or excessive
[1:46] jewelry and to now they'll marry two
[1:49] women together at their altar
[1:52] and there can be a lesbian or a
[1:54] homosexual priest that would perform the
[1:56] wedding
[1:58] how did they get there
[2:00] because they didn't believe God was the
[2:02] same yesterday today and forever
[2:04] they failed by the same thing he failed
[2:06] by hey she knew what the word was but
[2:09] she was made to believe that that word
[2:11] no longer counts in this situation
[2:14] and and it doesn't mean exactly like
[2:16] that for this and God won't judge
[2:21] and that's exactly what happened to the
[2:22] church but the problem is Amen in the
[2:25] message many message Believers have
[2:27] followed soon so as long as when the
[2:29] world goes here as long as the
[2:30] denomination church is back here and
[2:32] they say we're better than this standard
[2:34] then we're okay some of the message
[2:36] jerks have been following the
[2:37] denomination and as long as we're not as
[2:39] bad as the denomination we're okay
[2:42] but I said God help us not to fall into
[2:45] this trap I don't want to be a few
[2:47] degrees better than wrong I want to be
[2:49] right with the word of God
[2:52] if the prophet of God told us how to
[2:54] dress that's how we dress
[2:56] if the prophet of God told us how we
[2:58] conduct ourselves
[3:00] how we deal with one another how we live
[3:03] in the public how we whatever I mean we
[3:06] can we can go through all kinds of
[3:07] details but you get the point if the
[3:09] prophet of God taught it if the word of
[3:11] God is explicit on something that's
[3:13] still good today it was good amen it was
[3:16] good in 1969 it's still good in 2023.
[3:22] we shouldn't be changing with the times
