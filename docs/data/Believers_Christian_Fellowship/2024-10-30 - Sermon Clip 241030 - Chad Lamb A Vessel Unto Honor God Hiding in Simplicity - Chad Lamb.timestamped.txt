[0:00] brother brenaman preaching uh God hiding
[0:02] himself in Simplicity he's now coming to
[0:05] the preaching of the seals but he says
[0:07] I've got to preach this first then when
[0:09] he gets to the seventh seal he refers
[0:11] back to the the first service he
[0:13] preached God hiding he says remember
[0:15] remember God hiding himself in
[0:17] Simplicity why because now brother
[0:19] brandham is coming amen he's coming to
[0:22] the most Sublime scripture in all the
[0:24] Bible Revelation CH 5 when the lamb
[0:26] takes the book and then breaks the seals
[0:28] and he's coming to the breaking of the
[0:30] seals he's coming to the sounding of the
[0:32] seven Thunders that have been sealed up
[0:34] until the time of the end and it's going
[0:36] to take place right there where is it
[0:38] going to take place on the corner of two
[0:40] ordinary streets in an ordinary town in
[0:43] a small City and mid in the midwest
[0:48] USA in nowhere with nobody in a no-name
[0:52] place amen it's called brandom
[0:53] Tabernacle if you've ever been by it
[0:55] it's a simple box of a square building
[0:58] no Cathedral see
[1:00] no high arching spikes no decorative
[1:03] ornamentation just a brick Square on the
[1:06] corner of two side streets and a little
[1:09] city amen a little no-name place in
[1:11] Midwest USA God hiding himself in
[1:14] Simplicity what was taking place there
[1:17] the greatest thing that had happened one
[1:19] of the greatest things that ever
[1:20] happened was taking place in that brick
[1:22] building on the corner of aan
[1:24] pin God hiding himself in
[1:27] Simplicity chosen a chosen
[1:31] Tabernacle but it didn't look like
[1:34] it and who was the vessel he was going
[1:36] to use Amen to preach the seals the
[1:38] sound of Thunders it was going to be a
[1:40] man with a seventh grade education with
[1:43] no no educ no theological education a
[1:47] man who couldn't pronounce all those
[1:48] words a man who started in the ministry
[1:50] would ask his girlfriend to read the
[1:56] scriptures how would you like it if your
[1:58] pastor had to have his girlfriend read
[2:00] the scriptures before he started the
[2:02] service cuz he couldn't pronounce those
[2:04] big
[2:07] words some of you wouldn't go to church
[2:16] there amen was rejected by had no class
[2:21] had no form had no order had no elegant
[2:24] speech had no backing of denomination
[2:26] had no formal education he was simple
[2:29] humble amen a vessel of
[2:33] clay but to me he was a vessel unto
[2:37] honor amen not because of his stature
[2:40] not because of his eloquence not because
[2:42] of his education not because of his
[2:44] power because of who was in him amen and
[2:46] what he was doing he was a vessel unto
[2:48] honor and he didn't do it by education
[2:51] he didn't do it by politics he didn't do
[2:53] it by his great ability to put scripture
[2:55] with scripture he didn't have that
[2:57] ability it was the Holy Ghost who put
[2:59] with scripture with scripture and all he
[3:02] did was come out and say what was told
[3:04] him the Simplicity of just taking God at
[3:07] his word amen believing what he said and
[3:10] coming forth the same as Moses Moses
[3:12] didn't come with anything other than his
[3:14] faith in the word of God
