[3:01] as I was

[3:05] country road one
[3:08] day my thoughts were on my past all the
[3:14] roong that I have
[3:17] done and all the
[3:21] wrong that's been done to
[3:25] me how I was so discouraged
[3:30] seemed I could not go
[3:35] on
[3:37] forgiveness is something we all
[3:42] need it is a choice to receive it or to
[3:49] give it
[3:52] away that is only when we can be set
[3:59] free
[4:02] when it
[4:03] seemed I could not take another
[4:09] step I looked up just
[4:13] ahead where an old man was sitting by
[4:18] the side of the
[4:22] road as I was about to pass by he looked
[4:29] at me
[4:30] and

[4:40] need it is a choice to receive it or to

[5:06] words for my life was filled with so
[5:11] much
[5:12] pain he turned to me once more and he
[5:19] said this is only possible through the
[5:24] blood of Jesus
[5:27] Christ forgive
[5:30] foress is something we all
[5:34] need it is a choice to receive it or to
[5:41] give it

[12:28] [Music]
[12:41] amen let's all stand I appreciated that
[12:44] special amen and uh it's nice that
[12:48] brother Simon's jodan could go before
[12:51] and prepare the
[12:52] way we were around back he says that's
[12:55] how you do it here you send your kids
[12:56] first I said yeah if they make it then
[12:57] you can come out
[12:59] if it so praise God we certainly enjoyed
[13:04] their family we've got to spend some
[13:05] time together with he and his wife
[13:07] Maryam and their children we really
[13:09] enjoyed it amen I enjoyed brother
[13:11] Simon's friendship we've become friends
[13:13] over the last couple of weeks and it's
[13:15] precious the Lord has entrusted him over
[13:17] the last few years with a fellowship of
[13:19] Believers there that he ministers to and
[13:22] and uh I'm just excited to hear what the
[13:25] Lord's laid on his heart for us amen you
[13:28] know brother Simon has a difficult job
[13:30] because there's some Swiss in his church
[13:32] that speak Swiss German so he's used to
[13:35] preaching one line in English and he
[13:37] repeats the next line in Swiss German he
[13:40] translates himself I told him that's not
[13:43] necessary
[13:45] today we'll have a hard enough time with
[13:47] the proper
[13:48] English let alone the German but amen
[13:52] God's just given him the gift that he
[13:54] needs and the ability to minister to
[13:55] that group at this time and I just
[13:58] appreciate and he told me around back he
[13:59] says it's easy brother it's really no
[14:01] problem I said yeah so says you amen
[14:05] that's always the way it is the one who
[14:06] has the gift and ability imparted by God
[14:08] always thinks it's easy but the rest of
[14:10] us Marvel at it so I just appreciate the
[14:13] brother I appreciate what the Lord's
[14:15] done in his life appreciate his
[14:16] testimony he and his family and the
[14:18] light that they shine and I'm just uh
[14:21] excited to welcome him to come and and
[14:23] we just want him to be able to relax and
[14:26] what helps a preacher relax is when he
[14:27] feels that tug on the other side when he
[14:30] knows that now he's not in control that
[14:32] the spirit of God is taking over that's
[14:34] what helps a minister relax and brother
[14:36] B said it's up to us to operate the gift
[14:39] and so I want to make it a comfortable
[14:41] place where the brother can just relax
[14:42] and let God flow amen then we're going
[14:46] to invite our brother Simon with a song

[17:21] actually just a farm boy I was brother
[17:24] Ram came from Jeffersonville well
[17:26] actually um Kentucky
[17:29] but I came from a place called scabra
[17:31] God and it's it's Nazareth in
[17:35] England it's where I was born so I'm
[17:38] just me simple me and I just want to
[17:40] calm down before we start brother Chad
[17:42] kind of dropped it on me I like the way
[17:44] out there he says oh yeah Simon says
[17:46] it's
[17:47] easy make it sound like I'm bragging I'm
[17:50] I'm just it's just
[17:51] easy and you
[17:55] know brother Chad said oh I said we'll
[17:57] go we'll go hunting I I said fine fine
[17:59] he said oh do you want the 22 or the or
[18:02] the shotgun and I said well what do you
[18:05] mean he said well the shotgun is easier
[18:07] and I just said to him I said well
[18:08] brother Chad I said normally I don't
[18:10] really have a problem hitting stuff and
[18:13] he said
[18:15] o he said and he wnk he winked at
[18:18] whoever it was and he said ah he said
[18:20] then we'll give him the uh the gun with
[18:21] the bent
[18:24] Barrel
[18:26] well I've got a bit of a bent Barrel
[18:28] this morning cuz my nerves are here and
[18:30] that's makes it a bit more difficult to
[18:32] um to hit the target but it's not me
[18:34] it's him and it's all as well so we're
[18:37] just thankful to be here and I just like
[18:39] to greet the little church back home as
[18:41] well and um it's kind of miraculous how
[18:44] we got here but we're here and I wasn't
[18:46] expecting this on the way home from the
[18:48] old hunt brother Chad just dropped it on
[18:50] me you know when it was nice and
[18:53] relaxed just dropped it on me
[18:56] and yeah that's it
[18:59] so here we go so if we could please um
[19:02] opening scripture 1 Corinthians 13 I was
[19:04] at brother Jeremy's where's brother
[19:06] Jeremy where's brother
[19:08] Jeremy where is he there he is I was at
[19:12] his place yesterday and we started
[19:13] talking about the word with Brother John
[19:15] and
[19:16] that yeah I was
[19:20] thinking stop
[19:22] there otherwise I'd have had nothing to
[19:24] preach today so 1 Corinthians 13 if we
[19:27] could
[19:30] and I think my wife's more nervous than
[19:31] I am and she's been telling me she woke
[19:33] up this morning in the middle of the
[19:34] night and screamed at me don't talk
[19:39] fast but brother Jeremy had said to me
[19:41] yesterday he said we've got Africans and
[19:43] Indians and everyone Prett he said we'll
[19:45] understand you so I'm just trusting on
[19:46] that
[19:47] one but the Lord is good if we all just
[19:50] you know my desire is to point is to
[19:53] point the the bride to the Lord Jesus
[19:56] Christ you know brother manam was given
[19:58] that commission hunt my bride and then
[20:00] he talks about those younger ones that
[20:01] will carry on the message so that's our
[20:04] commission is to point towards the Lord
[20:07] Jesus Christ and that's that's that's
[20:09] what we want to do so if we're going to
[20:10] read if we can 1 Corinthians 9-12
[20:14] 9-12 if we
[20:16] could verse
[20:19] 9-2 scripture says for we know in part
[20:22] and we prophesy in part but when that
[20:24] which is perfect is come then that which
[20:27] is in part shall be done away when I was
[20:28] a child I spake as a child I understood
[20:30] as a child I thought as a child but when
[20:32] I became a man I put away childish
[20:34] things for now we see through a glass
[20:36] Darkly but then face to face now I know
[20:39] in part but then I shall know but then
[20:43] shall I know even as I am known let's
[20:47] just pray over the word Lord Jesus as we
[20:49] come before you please speak to us we
[20:50] pray help us and encourages in your name
[20:52] we ask father amen so you may be seated
[20:55] the Lord's
[20:56] good so sometimes the Lord speak to us
[20:59] in various ways in different ways and
[21:01] you know somebody might maybe a
[21:04] testimony or something somebody will say
[21:05] something to you and you know that the
[21:08] Lord's speaking to you and you know
[21:11] maybe maybe the person that says it
[21:14] doesn't even know what they're saying
[21:16] but you know you know cuz you've heard
[21:19] it and you know that that came from the
[21:20] Lord amen and and it wasn't your brother
[21:23] or your sister it was the Lord so now
[21:25] this week I can't remember when it was I
[21:27] was um speaking to Brother John and you
[21:31] know we were just talking about how the
[21:32] word opens up and how we're just seeing
[21:35] in this day we're just seeing so much
[21:37] more seeing so much clearly and he said
[21:39] you know it's like the bar of Revelation
[21:42] is being
[21:43] lifted and then he said he just sort of
[21:46] stopped and he looked at and he said
[21:48] it's the raising of the veil and I knew
[21:51] that wasn't brother John I knew that was
[21:52] the Lord and so that's what we'd like to
[21:55] speak today the title we would call it
[21:57] the raising of the veil and you know
[22:01] when he said that a picture s of kind of
[22:03] opened up to
[22:04] me and it's not lifting of the veil it's
[22:09] not the taking off of the veil it's the
[22:11] raising of the veil and the Lord is and
[22:15] we're thinking of like this this
[22:16] marriage Veil this wedding veil and you
[22:20] know the veil is being slow like lift
[22:22] raised it's being
[22:24] raised
[22:26] and this message message the message of
[22:28] the hour is actually it's preparing the
[22:30] bride for the to to bring her to the
[22:32] wedding it's bringing her to a wedding
[22:34] it's calling her and so this wedding
[22:36] veil as it rises higher and higher it's
[22:39] going to it comes to the point where
[22:40] suddenly now we can see past the
[22:43] veil and we'll see face to face now I've
[22:47] never walked down the aisle with a
[22:51] wedding veil
[22:52] on I know when I got married I was silly
[22:55] and I think even brother Mike's got a
[22:57] picture of me somewhere with me wearing
[22:58] the wedding veil which is a spiritual
[23:01] type but I've never walked down the
[23:03] aisle with a wedding veil on but we'd
[23:04] like to look at that quickly as a as a
[23:06] nice little type I'm sure the sisters
[23:08] here obviously they know how it
[23:10] is and I can only imagine that as you're
[23:13] walking down the aisle it's kind of
[23:15] blurry because the old veils swinging
[23:18] left and right and it's kind of made of
[23:19] lace usually I think yeah you know but
[23:23] as you starting out at the at the end of
[23:26] the door you starting out and as a young
[23:29] Christian you're run your walk and
[23:31] you're looking down the the aisle of
[23:34] life you know and you're looking to your
[23:37] future husband when you become a
[23:38] Christian you become a Christian because
[23:41] you're following the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:42] that's the one that you're walking
[23:44] towards and you know in your heart even
[23:47] though when you come through those doors
[23:48] or you come through the
[23:50] spiritual example in your life as a
[23:53] young Christian you come through the
[23:54] doors and everything's kind of blurry is
[23:55] that is that right s am I talking
[23:57] nonsense here yeah fine so you come
[23:59] through the and you kind of you see a
[24:01] couple of guys at the front there
[24:03] where's Abby
[24:05] and this is prep
[24:08] talk so you kind of see as you walk
[24:11] through it's like kind of like is that
[24:14] Jack or is that Josh or whoever it is
[24:17] you just see two men standing there I'm
[24:19] just making this a
[24:21] story but you but in your heart you know
[24:25] that your future husband he's there so
[24:27] you know even though it's kind of blurry
[24:29] you're still walking towards him you
[24:31] know he's that you know it's him that's
[24:32] there amen and that's how it is for us
[24:34] as Christian you know you know you maybe
[24:36] can't see clearly with your eyes because
[24:38] you're still veiled but as you get
[24:41] closer you start to see which one it is
[24:45] you know I mean I didn't come out of a
[24:46] trinitarian church but maybe for the
[24:48] trinitarians as they're walking closer
[24:50] to the L it's like whoa whoa who there's
[24:51] not three there just the one you know
[24:54] but as you get closer you start to see
[24:56] more clearly and you're seeing the
[24:57] bridegroom
[25:00] am and then when the veil is finally
[25:03] lifted then you see face to face and
[25:06] then it as the scripture says you will
[25:08] know even as you are known okay so then
[25:12] when you're face to face you actually
[25:15] now you can see who you are amen you can
[25:19] see that you are actually a bride you
[25:21] can see and you see yourself now as he
[25:25] sees you now this is beautiful because
[25:28] when you're at the end there when you're
[25:29] at the start of the doors opened up and
[25:32] you kind of go through you couldn't see
[25:34] him
[25:35] clearly but he could always see you
[25:38] clearly it's beautiful you see see he
[25:41] always sees you now notice because he's
[25:43] not veiled he doesn't have a veil over
[25:46] so when when you jack You Know Jack he's
[25:48] not going to have this Veil over his
[25:49] face he's going to be he sees absolutely
[25:52] clearly he sees who you are and the Lord
[25:55] he sees us how we are it's it's the
[25:57] Naturals typing clearly you see the Lord
[25:59] Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega and so
[26:02] he sees you from the Omega you know I
[26:06] say this quite often but he do he
[26:08] doesn't see he's the Alpha and the Omega
[26:10] he's actually looking at you from the
[26:12] end am you know he sees you clearly
[26:16] because he chose you amen so when you
[26:19] come through the door you might just see
[26:20] this guy but he knows who you are cuz
[26:22] he's the one who chose you he's the one
[26:24] that called you to the
[26:25] wedding you know and
[26:28] he chose us from before the foundation
[26:30] of the world so before you even went
[26:32] through that door he saw you he knew you
[26:36] he's seeing and not only seeing you
[26:38] coming down the aisle but he's seeing
[26:40] you like
[26:41] there there in the New Jerusalem he sees
[26:44] you there so now as we coming down to
[26:47] the end of time we're coming down this
[26:50] aisle of life you could
[26:52] say and it's it's we get to the point in
[26:57] dis compensational time I think that's
[26:59] the right word I'm not so
[27:00] clever but we're coming to the end where
[27:02] it's time to kind of raise the veil you
[27:04] don't lift the veil back there you lift
[27:06] it at the front and and the time that
[27:08] we're living in is the time when we are
[27:10] starting to see him face to face and
[27:13] it's the time when we're starting to see
[27:15] ourselves who we are and we're starting
[27:17] to see him through see ourselves through
[27:20] his eyes you know it's it's it's who we
[27:23] are and what it means to be who you are
[27:27] and this is what we're trying to kind of
[27:29] you know it's beautiful like the word of
[27:32] God's like a diamond and and there's so
[27:35] many facets you can turn each and every
[27:38] way and you see something maybe a little
[27:41] bit different to help you and it's not a
[27:42] new diamond but you're helping to show
[27:45] and to see what the actual diamonds all
[27:49] about so as we think about title it's
[27:52] the raising of the veil I just love the
[27:55] word you know something just jumps out
[27:57] at you it just it just excites you so
[28:00] when I read this scripture
[28:02] yesterday I'd like to read verse 12
[28:04] again verse
[28:05] 12 for now we see through a glass Darkly
[28:08] but then face to face now I know in part
[28:12] but then shall I know even as I am known
[28:16] and you know I thought a glass it says
[28:20] here so see through a glass Darkly and
[28:22] here we know that in the scripture a
[28:24] glass the word glass means a mirror okay
[28:26] so this this this word and and the the
[28:29] Greek word would be o o optron and it
[28:32] means clearly a mirror it doesn't mean
[28:33] anything else it means a mirror so we're
[28:36] kind of we're looking into this mirror
[28:38] but I don't know about you but when I
[28:40] look into the mirror well for starters
[28:42] it's
[28:43] scary but if if I look into a mirror you
[28:46] know I I I don't look at I either look
[28:49] at the mirror or I look into the
[28:52] mirror okay but you know brother random
[28:55] says that the mirrors the word amen okay
[28:59] but here it says that we're not looking
[29:01] at the mirror or into the mirror it says
[29:02] we're looking through the mirror amen it
[29:05] says through and I checked it with the
[29:08] um it mean that's what it means it means
[29:10] through when you look at it and in the
[29:12] Luther Bible as well um it's it's
[29:16] through so we're actually looking
[29:17] through this mirror so the mirror of the
[29:19] word is the only mirror that we can
[29:21] actually look through okay to see
[29:24] ourselves we're not looking into the
[29:26] word yeah we're looking through the word
[29:28] to see who we
[29:30] are you know and when we see who we
[29:34] are through the word then we see
[29:38] ourselves as he sees us CU if I look in
[29:41] the mirror then I just see failure then
[29:43] I see Nazareth I see
[29:45] scabra but when I look through his word
[29:48] it shows me another birthplace it shows
[29:51] me another origin and it's not the gamy
[29:54] little Seaside town of
[29:56] scabra yes
[29:58] amen you know like brother R talks about
[30:01] the little
[30:02] boy who he he you know he he climbs the
[30:05] steps and looks in the
[30:06] mirror and uh I'll just read that I'll
[30:08] just read this is the only this is a
[30:10] quote out of uh things that are to be
[30:12] and brother talks about many times but
[30:14] we'll take it from
[30:15] here brother says Christians I may never
[30:17] see you see you again see it's been
[30:20] years since I've been here may never see
[30:21] you again line up with God's word look
[30:24] in the
[30:25] mirror he says like a little boy one
[30:28] time had been out in the country never
[30:29] seen a mirror he come to his Auntie's
[30:32] house he started walking up the steps he
[30:35] seen a mirror he seen a little boy in
[30:38] the mirror he kept walking up looking
[30:40] and he would he would wave the little
[30:42] boy would wave and he kept looking he'd
[30:45] never seen himself in a mirror so when
[30:47] he got close enough he turned around he
[30:48] said why mama that's
[30:50] me so brother brother Franco if you
[30:52] could uh turn on the
[30:55] uh I'm used to pen and paper I don't
[30:58] even do I
[30:59] don't I struggle to I struggle to drive
[31:02] my phone so I'm going to have a go with
[31:04] this one at home I've got a
[31:07] whiteboard the Lord's good so so so so
[31:11] we see like this this little
[31:14] boy the
[31:16] boy he he's climbing these steps do we
[31:18] get it on yep yep where's the that's it
[31:21] there sorry I'm not very good I'm not
[31:23] very good at drawing a there we
[31:26] go don't laugh at
[31:30] me okay he's climbing up these
[31:34] steps but we notice now thinking of what
[31:37] we said about the bride and the
[31:38] bridegroom before you know the one who's
[31:41] now watching this but tells this story
[31:43] about this boy the boy's kind of walking
[31:46] up the steps I could oh where do I start
[31:48] oh I can he got a DOT I made awesome so
[31:51] this little boy he's
[31:54] uh
[31:56] oh
[32:00] he's walking up the
[32:01] steps it's easier on the way
[32:04] board anyway so he's walking step now
[32:08] now now the point is is is that for the
[32:10] one who's watching this boy now so let's
[32:13] just say this some let's just say it's
[32:14] you you're watching this little boy and
[32:16] he's kind of climbing up these
[32:19] stairs now the little boy he starts
[32:24] weaving he's pulling his ear or whatever
[32:26] how brother J it and then suddenly he
[32:29] gets his Revelation that's him but
[32:32] listen the one who's been watching okay
[32:36] always knew that the boy and the
[32:38] reflection were one the one that's
[32:42] watching always knows that the little
[32:45] boy and the reflection are one and the
[32:48] same you know so so you know the Lord is
[32:52] looking at us from the
[32:55] Omega and because he the Alpha and the
[32:57] Omega he always knew that you and the
[33:00] reflection of the word is one of the
[33:02] same because the bride is reflecting the
[33:05] Lord Jesus Christ you see this is a
[33:06] mirror we look through the mirror of the
[33:08] word but what the Lord sees reflecting
[33:10] back is his
[33:11] bride and it's awesome so so so so the
[33:15] Lord Jesus he sees that you and the
[33:17] mirror are one and the same now but for
[33:21] the little boy it took time for the
[33:23] Revelation to kind of sink in and for
[33:26] him to get it right to realize who he
[33:29] was and you know I
[33:31] wonder if there was maybe seven
[33:34] steps you know what I mean I wonder if
[33:37] there was maybe seven steps and you know
[33:40] I wonder if I wonder if where is this
[33:44] thing there I wonder you know if the
[33:47] mirror on the
[33:48] wall wasn't kind of shaped like that are
[33:51] you reading
[33:52] me I wonder if that's what the mirror
[33:55] was shaped like amen
[33:57] you know because the bride's come up
[33:59] these seven steps she's come up these
[34:01] seven Church ages and at the top now
[34:03] she's found a mirror so now she's got
[34:05] the I sister Marin will be laughing at
[34:08] me right now because I am not good so
[34:11] she's supposed to be a
[34:13] bride the bride's looking into this
[34:16] mirror okay she's looking kind
[34:18] of I don't know if that's how you do it
[34:20] but
[34:21] anyway she's she's looking into this
[34:24] mirror she's climbed these seven Church
[34:26] agents is but now she comes if you
[34:28] notice and I can't point it out to you
[34:30] but if you if you notice the top step is
[34:33] kind of a like a longer
[34:36] step top you know and this is now we've
[34:39] come to the top because the scripture
[34:43] says that we go out to meet him so so
[34:46] there's this climbing up the seven
[34:48] Church ages and then we kind of walk
[34:49] forward let's just turn to Matthew 25
[34:52] Matthew 25
[34:53] 6-10 Matthew 25 6-10
[34:58] just read that
[35:02] quickly so Matthew 2561 and at midnight
[35:06] there was a cry made behold the
[35:07] bridegroom cometh go ye out to me this
[35:09] is this guys this is personal it doesn't
[35:12] say all right all you guys just go out
[35:13] to meet him he says go ye out to meet
[35:15] him so actually the letter is written to
[35:17] everybody but it's for the bride to
[35:19] actually read herself in here so go ye
[35:21] out to meet him then all those virgins
[35:23] arose and trimmed their lamps and the
[35:24] foolish said unto the wise givers of
[35:26] your oil for have gone out but the wise
[35:28] answered saying not so lest there be not
[35:29] enough for us and you but go rather to
[35:31] them that sell and buy for yourselves
[35:33] while they went to by the bridegroom
[35:36] came and they that were already went in
[35:38] with him to the marriage and the door
[35:39] was
[35:40] shut
[35:42] so we've had this message go out I don't
[35:44] know about you but you know this the
[35:47] message that we've heard the message of
[35:48] the hour has been a lamp tring message
[35:51] this message I don't know anybody else
[35:54] who laid it down so clearly to clean up
[35:56] your life like
[35:58] brother this this this has been a lamp
[36:01] trimming message and we've been told to
[36:03] kick out all the junk of your life kick
[36:06] it out you know I didn't write this down
[36:08] but the scripture says the scripture
[36:09] says you know um come out from among
[36:12] them be separate touch not the unclean
[36:14] thing and then there's a little word in
[36:15] there it says
[36:16] and and he says and I will receive you
[36:19] that is not just for everyone that's got
[36:21] there's a clause on there so he will
[36:23] only receive you if you kick out all the
[36:25] junk it says come out from among them
[36:28] touch not the unclean thing and I will
[36:31] accept you so this is this is really a
[36:33] message that we've had so we've come to
[36:35] this
[36:36] stop stop step and we've been walking
[36:39] forwards now we been walking forward
[36:42] since 65 since the prophet left the
[36:45] scene we've been walking forwards now
[36:46] notice we've not been walking up steps
[36:50] we've been walking
[36:52] forward okay there's not another step
[36:54] we're going forward you see and if you
[36:56] notice it's exactly like it is in the
[36:59] Great Pyramid Amen in the Great Pyramid
[37:01] you come up the the seven steps and then
[37:04] there's kind of a walking forward to
[37:06] do and so you know we know that's the
[37:08] second Bible and it's just so perfect
[37:09] before you get to the king's chamber
[37:11] there's that the walking forward okay so
[37:13] so in this time of walking forward we've
[37:15] been kind of seeing through the wedding
[37:17] veil let's be honest we've been seeing
[37:20] through the wedding veil you know see
[37:23] for start people never even knew who
[37:24] Blan was until until he went the scene
[37:27] till years afterwards and I don't know
[37:29] about you but I went through most of my
[37:31] life just going to church and you know
[37:33] she'll be right mate she won't be right
[37:35] mate you know you just cuz you were see
[37:38] you didn't see clearly there was still
[37:40] that pull inside you but you didn't see
[37:42] clearly you see we'd been seeing through
[37:45] a wedding veil there oh yes well you see
[37:49] have had the wedding veil since I gave
[37:51] the heart to the I thought he saw you
[37:53] from
[37:54] Omega I thought he called you before he
[37:57] called you you might not have listened
[37:59] but he called you so we didn't see
[38:01] clearly who we were so it's been unclear
[38:03] for us at times and you know especially
[38:07] for for me for me in my life you know
[38:09] even when the Lord called you there
[38:10] there's that that process you've been
[38:12] going through even since even in the
[38:14] last year two years three years there's
[38:15] this constant kicking out and constant
[38:18] looking into the through the mirror of
[38:20] the word and seeing well actually that's
[38:22] not right and kick that one out actually
[38:23] what is it it's it's it's because we
[38:25] didn't see quite
[38:27] clearly and you know maybe you might get
[38:31] some religious fell and he'll say oh
[38:34] well of course you don't see as clearly
[38:36] as me well I just say well praise the
[38:40] Lord because if I don't see clearly it's
[38:43] because of the wedding
[38:44] veil and if I'm wearing a wedding veil
[38:47] yeah it means that I'm on my way down
[38:49] the
[38:50] aisle and if I'm wearing that wedding
[38:52] veil it means that he's going to pull it
[38:54] off one day so actually we can we can
[38:57] take comfort we can take comfort as long
[39:00] as we've got that wedding veil on it's
[39:03] going to be pulled off so be encouraged
[39:05] you know we we're on our way down the
[39:07] aisle we're on our way
[39:10] and we're getting there where it's the
[39:12] raising of the
[39:14] veil you know we're living in the days
[39:16] of the seventh angel when the Mysteries
[39:17] are made known that had to come before
[39:21] the the the the the veil could be raised
[39:23] we'll just read Revelation 10:7 quickly
[39:25] um revelation 10:7
[39:31] Revelation it's just one just the one
[39:32] verse so we'll just read that but in
[39:34] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[39:36] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[39:39] of God should be finished as he has
[39:41] declared to his servants the
[39:42] prophets now the Mysteries should be
[39:46] finished
[39:48] including the mystery of who she
[39:51] is okay including the mystery of her
[39:56] position in Christ am and if we notice
[40:01] it's truly only the last handful of
[40:03] years that that we that that we've
[40:06] realized actually the revelation of who
[40:09] she is and what it means you know he
[40:12] broken forth and we know that brother R
[40:14] said these things
[40:16] but it it wasn't clear to us it wasn't
[40:18] clear to me but like the mirror on the
[40:21] wall that mirror has been there since'
[40:24] 65 the mirror
[40:27] okay but I was kind of still pulling my
[40:29] ear I don't about you I was pulling and
[40:30] I was waving and it took that certain
[40:33] amount of time for us to realize whoa
[40:35] actually can this be can it
[40:39] be you know just sometimes it's just so
[40:43] too much you know we've walking down the
[40:45] aisle and we've come right down to the
[40:47] front
[40:49] here and don't forget just break it it
[40:52] to you gently Jack you can't walk
[40:55] further than here
[40:56] yeah this is the furthest you can
[40:59] get without taking another
[41:04] name see what I mean you can walk as far
[41:06] as the altar the only way out is to go
[41:09] back out that way and you're carrying a
[41:11] new
[41:12] name that's where we are it's awesome
[41:15] and we're carrying his name his name so
[41:18] as we get down to the altar now we're
[41:19] starting to realize who we are suddenly
[41:22] now we can see clearly and the bride's
[41:24] identity is being unve
[41:27] failed I mean think of it 20 years ago I
[41:30] don't know you I we traveled a lot so we
[41:32] heard a lot of preaching but we would
[41:34] hear like oh your bride your bride your
[41:36] bride you know everything's fine but
[41:39] nobody kind of knew what it meant you
[41:42] know but were way up the aisle somewhere
[41:45] and he was just like oh well
[41:46] everything's fine and the the veil was
[41:48] kind of swinging and all we knew was
[41:50] your bride your bride your bride but 20
[41:53] years ago it wasn't time cuz we were
[41:54] still up there we weren't down here
[41:56] and so the unveiling of the Bride it has
[41:59] to happen right before the Rapture it
[42:02] has to because don't
[42:04] forget the Rapture happens after the
[42:07] marriage takes place because the
[42:09] marriage supper follows the marriage we
[42:12] go to the marriage supper and don't
[42:15] forget the veil is only lifted when
[42:18] she's married when the vows have been
[42:21] given yeah then the veil is
[42:24] lifted bride and the bride room it's a
[42:26] union of the two and you know they make
[42:30] their vows they have to vow to one
[42:33] another and a public ceremony takes
[42:37] place it's public it's not done in
[42:40] secret was brother R was was this St in
[42:44] secret no no this the bride the Lord
[42:50] Jesus veiled in flesh revealed in flesh
[42:52] once again here is it in secret amen I
[42:55] think brother you know said something
[42:57] about you know people driving past the
[42:59] um the road and seeing the church
[43:01] and do you kind of hide the sign at the
[43:04] front no it's not done in secret so
[43:06] there's a public ceremony taking place
[43:08] but now the beautiful thing is that in
[43:11] order now for the wedding to take
[43:15] place both parties have to be present
[43:20] both have to be present the bride that's
[43:22] here the bride has to be present am
[43:26] otherwise there's no winning but so does
[43:29] the
[43:30] bridegroom so you wonder why the Lord
[43:32] appears after 20 2,000 years how can it
[43:36] be because the wedding's taking place
[43:39] and both have to be there both parties
[43:42] have got to be there yes sir and so
[43:45] during these vows he Reveals His secrets
[43:47] to his bride and he through the word
[43:50] he's restoring her back to the faith of
[43:52] the Pentecostal fathers we aren't
[43:53] talking about jumping and showing we're
[43:55] talking about the true Pentecost he's
[43:57] he's pointing her back to the
[43:59] original and you know he's telling her
[44:01] all his Secrets yeah and he reveals to
[44:05] her the promises the vows the promises
[44:08] that he's made he's reminding her of the
[44:10] vows that he made and then she accepts
[44:12] his word and the marriage takes
[44:15] place you know we're going to the
[44:17] marriage supper now we're witnessing
[44:19] this unveiling of the Bride in our day
[44:22] we're witnessing this we're seeing it
[44:23] we're seeing I don't know about you but
[44:25] I've spent three weeks here and I've
[44:27] seen the Lord Jesus Christ in flesh
[44:29] again I've seen it you know this veil of
[44:33] is being raised we're seeing who we are
[44:36] you know people might say oh yeah well I
[44:39] know who I am you know but do we know
[44:41] what we understand do we understand what
[44:42] it means do we understand what it means
[44:45] to actually be the Bride of the Lord
[44:47] Jesus
[44:48] Christ so now maybe if we
[44:51] can just turn the diamond a little bit
[44:55] and look at Who We Are are look at who
[44:56] we are what it means and
[44:59] so I'd like to I'd like to share
[45:01] something if we could turn to Genesis
[45:04] 17 Genesis
[45:10] 17 and I just pray that the Lord gives
[45:12] us Grace to see something a little bit
[45:15] to see from a different angle you know
[45:17] if we can just find Grace in The Lord's
[45:20] sight that he would personally to one of
[45:22] us to each one of us that's our prayer
[45:24] every one of us just to raise that Veil
[45:25] a little bit higher you see we're going
[45:28] to read about Abraham and we see that
[45:29] Abraham was a man of faith and he was a
[45:31] father of Nations he was all these
[45:33] things but maybe we can see something in
[45:36] here how Abraham and Sarah their
[45:39] relationship is is perfect type of
[45:41] Christ and the bride so we're going to
[45:44] read uh 17
[45:46] 1-8 and when Abram was
[45:50] 9 years 19 years old and N the Lord
[45:53] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[45:55] the almighty God walk before me be thou
[45:58] perfect I will make my Covenant between
[46:00] thee me and thee and I will multiply
[46:01] thee exceedingly Abraham fell on his
[46:03] face and God talked with him saying as
[46:07] for me behold my
[46:09] Covenant which is with thee and thou
[46:11] shalt be a father unto many nations of
[46:13] many nations neither shall my thy name
[46:16] anymore be called Abraham but thy name
[46:17] Shall be Called Abraham for a father of
[46:20] many nations have I made thee and I will
[46:22] make the exceedingly fruitful and I will
[46:24] make nations of thee and kings shall
[46:26] come out of thee and I will establish my
[46:27] Covenant between me and thee and thy
[46:29] seed after thee in the generations for
[46:31] an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[46:33] thee and to thy seed after thee and I
[46:35] will give unto thee and to thy seed
[46:36] after thee the land wherein thou art a
[46:38] stranger all land of Canaan for an
[46:40] everlasting possession and I will be
[46:42] their God
[46:44] Amen so at this point in
[46:46] scriptures Abraham at the point that we'
[46:48] started at reading we started reading in
[46:50] chapter
[46:52] 17 and a happens 99 years old
[46:56] so the promise has long been given to
[46:59] Abraham okay he and he all this time
[47:02] he's been walking by
[47:03] faith but now something changes in
[47:06] Abraham's life and you know he started
[47:08] out when he started out in his life he
[47:11] was called Abram but now in order to
[47:14] fulfill this promise okay the Lord gives
[47:17] him Grace which would be verse five
[47:20] gives him Grace and he changes his name
[47:22] from Abraham Abram to Abraham amen so
[47:26] he's been walking by faith but he's been
[47:28] seeing through this veil of a 99 year
[47:32] old person can you imagine how much
[47:34] Faith you had to have the old veils
[47:37] swinging maybe Abraham that would be his
[47:39] gray hair getting in the wind and he
[47:40] can't see and you know it's like the
[47:43] bride walking towards her future husband
[47:45] you know he was walking but in his heart
[47:48] he knew he knew that the Lord was going
[47:51] to fulfill his promise he was just
[47:52] walking by faith towards something
[47:54] although it wasn't
[47:56] clear you know he Abraham had AB at this
[47:59] point Abraham had zero idea of how the
[48:03] Lord was going to fulfill his promise no
[48:06] idea but he knew that inside him
[48:08] something had to change something had to
[48:10] change and you know the the bride is
[48:13] exactly the same thing she's got no idea
[48:15] exactly how she's going to be raptured
[48:17] I've got no idea she's got no idea how
[48:19] it's going to how the body change is
[48:21] going to happen she's got no idea you
[48:23] know she just knows that to be there
[48:26] where he is something's going to change
[48:29] something has to change because in this
[48:31] body I'm looking through I'm not 199 but
[48:33] I feel
[48:35] it I'm not looking through a veil of a
[48:37] 99 year old person but if you imagine
[48:40] we're looking through this body as a
[48:43] veil and we're just thinking it ain't
[48:46] happening in this body it ain't
[48:48] happening you know what I mean
[48:50] something's got to change this Immortal
[48:52] this Mortal has to put on the
[48:53] immortality something's got to happen
[48:56] and so notice as soon as this promise
[48:58] now is given to Abraham it's actually in
[49:01] Genesis
[49:02] 12 okay Genesis 12 the promise is given
[49:05] to Abraham we were in 17 we'll turn to
[49:09] we'll turn to 12 in a minute in fact you
[49:10] can start turning to
[49:12] 12 the Lord once the promise was given
[49:15] in chapter 12 the Lord could never take
[49:18] that promise away am no matter what
[49:22] happened it could not change the Lord if
[49:26] he says something he's got to do it so
[49:29] This Promise had to be fulfilled let's
[49:31] read the promise we'll read Genesis 12
[49:35] 1:3 Genesis 12 1:3 now the Lord said
[49:38] unto Abram he's remember he still Abram
[49:40] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[49:42] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[49:45] a land that I will show thee and I will
[49:47] make of thee a great nation and I will
[49:50] bless thee and make Thy Thy Name Great
[49:52] Thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[49:55] bless them that bless thee and curse
[49:57] them that curseth thee and in thee shall
[50:00] all the families of the earth be blessed
[50:02] that's beautiful now notice in verse one
[50:06] notice in verse one there had to be a
[50:07] change take place Abraham had to leave
[50:10] everything that he ever knew okay in
[50:13] order to walk with the Lord right and
[50:16] for the bride we're the same we have to
[50:18] leave everything that we ever knew we
[50:20] have to we have to leave father and
[50:22] mother we've got to leave absolutely
[50:24] everything and we have to to be one with
[50:26] Christ to to to unite with Christ we
[50:28] have to leave everything behind you know
[50:31] and Abraham was led to that land that
[50:34] was prepared for him and for us to go to
[50:37] that land that's prepared for us we've
[50:39] got to give everything up we have to
[50:40] give it up so now if we hold our hand
[50:43] just hold your hand in there and turn to
[50:45] Matthew 19 please Matthew 19 cuz we're
[50:48] going to flick back here in a minute
[50:49] Matthew 19 and we're going to read verse
[50:51] 4-
[50:53] 6 Matthew 19:4 4-
[50:59] 6 and it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:01] speaking here and he answered and said
[51:04] unto them have you not read that he this
[51:06] is very important now we have to we have
[51:08] to really remember this one have ye not
[51:10] read that he which made them at the
[51:13] beginning made them male and female and
[51:16] said for this cause shall a man leave
[51:19] father and mother and shall cleave unto
[51:20] his wife and they twain shall be one
[51:24] flesh so the Lord is pointing here now
[51:28] that a a change has to happen there's
[51:30] got to be a change happening you know
[51:32] for the in order for the two to become
[51:34] one you've got to leave father and
[51:35] mother you've got to talking a natural
[51:37] type of spirit you've got to leave
[51:40] everything in order to be United with
[51:42] Christ there's got to be a leaving of
[51:44] the old doesn't matter what the old may
[51:47] be you've got to leave it doesn't matter
[51:49] what you so in order to step into that
[51:51] new now notice once the two were joined
[51:55] they were one now one you can't separate
[52:00] okay and don't come with clever
[52:02] scientific what about the molecules and
[52:03] stuff we're talking about the Lord here
[52:04] you can't separate to keep it simple two
[52:08] shall become one end the story okay so
[52:11] now if we go back to Genesis 12 then
[52:13] remembering what we just read there then
[52:16] we see here in verse one that the Lord
[52:19] shows Abraham that A change is needed he
[52:21] says get out of your old life amen you
[52:25] know
[52:26] get out of get out of get out of where
[52:28] you've come from Leave it all behind and
[52:30] and I will lead you into this new land
[52:32] now
[52:33] remember that we want the Lord to raise
[52:36] the veil a little bit for us this
[52:37] morning yes sir we want the Lord to
[52:39] raise the veil of our understanding to
[52:42] see
[52:44] clearly now we notice that when the Lord
[52:46] Speaks now to
[52:48] Abraham and gives This Promise he only
[52:51] speaks to
[52:52] Abraham okay he does not speak to Sarah
[52:56] he speaks to
[52:57] Abraham right but all the time the Lord
[53:01] is only speaking to Abraham but we
[53:04] notice in verse 5 he says get thee out
[53:06] of the land he says you go but in verse
[53:09] five when it's time for him to leave we
[53:12] can read verse five the first part of
[53:13] verse 5 and Abraham took Sarah's wife so
[53:16] when it comes time for him to leave
[53:19] interestingly he leaves this place
[53:20] called
[53:21] Haron and he he take he takes Sarah with
[53:25] uh obviously it's his wife but this word
[53:29] haran actually means parched it means
[53:31] dry it means drought it means a parched
[53:34] land and so when you know we talk about
[53:38] leaving our stiff and starchy ideas
[53:39] you've got to leave the old dead stuff
[53:41] behind if it's dried out it's kind of
[53:43] dead you know whether it's a I don't
[53:47] know anything even a pizza even a pizza
[53:49] when it's dried up it's pretty dead but
[53:51] you know what I mean like natural things
[53:53] if if it's dried up it's dead so you got
[53:54] to leave the dead stuff behind and come
[53:56] into the new land you know brother
[53:57] brother Bam um in the original um spoken
[54:00] words The Original Seed he he speaks
[54:02] about coming out from Methodist Baptist
[54:03] Pentecostal he says they're all dried up
[54:05] there's no water there there's no life
[54:07] that's right you know and in order for
[54:09] us to to step up these steps and to go
[54:12] into this new land of Revelation Where
[54:14] the River of Life is Flowing we've got
[54:16] to leave the old dead stuff
[54:19] behind so now when Abraham leaves Haron
[54:22] which is the old we just looked at that
[54:24] he takes sah his wife now we've just
[54:28] read how the Lord Jesus reminded us that
[54:30] be even before Abraham in the beginning
[54:32] the two were made one okay so he he
[54:36] reminds us that from Matthew 19 they
[54:39] were no longer Twain but they were one
[54:42] okay they were one flesh so now all the
[54:44] time that these promises had been given
[54:47] to Abraham Sarah was automatically
[54:50] included in the
[54:51] promise sir you know the promise was
[54:54] given to AB Abraham but she was
[54:55] automatically pulled in because the two
[54:58] are
[55:00] one you know if we're spiritual we can't
[55:02] see where we're going because we the
[55:04] bride of Christ we've been given a
[55:06] promise we've been given promises
[55:09] nothing can change or take away the
[55:11] promise let's just turn to Romans 19
[55:13] Romans 9 sorry Romans 9 let's just turn
[55:16] to Romans
[55:18] 9 Romans chapter
[55:21] 9 if we read 21- 24 please 21 to
[55:29] 4 half not the Potter power over the
[55:32] clay of the same lump to make the same
[55:35] lump to make one vessel unto honor and
[55:36] another un to dishonor what if God
[55:38] willing to show his wroth and to make
[55:40] the power his power known endureth with
[55:43] much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath
[55:45] fitted to destruction and that he might
[55:48] make the the known the ve The Riches of
[55:51] his glory on the vessels of Mercy which
[55:54] he ha a for prepared unto Glory even us
[55:58] whom he hath called not of the Jews only
[56:01] but also of the Gentiles so now notice
[56:04] here the bride it says in verse 23 the
[56:08] bride has been a for prepared unto Glory
[56:12] that's right so the bride has been
[56:15] predestinated and the word predestinate
[56:18] isn't really rocket science that
[56:19] destination is preset it's predestinated
[56:22] so the bride been predestinated unto the
[56:24] glory Glory that the Lord has already
[56:27] prepared for
[56:29] us the glory is already
[56:32] prepared so now just flick over to
[56:34] Romans 8 over the page Romans 8:14
[56:38] to18 Romans 8:14 to 18 for as many as
[56:41] are led by the spirit of God they are
[56:43] the sons of God for ye have not received
[56:45] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[56:47] you have received the spirit of adoption
[56:49] whereby we cry ABA father the spirit
[56:52] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[56:54] that we are are the children of God and
[56:56] if the children then HS HS of God and
[56:59] Joint HS with Christ you know what joint
[57:01] Heir is that's
[57:03] right I yeah I have actually when my
[57:06] Granda passed away we got a little bit
[57:07] of something that was a joint air that
[57:10] means it's you and somebody else and if
[57:13] there's two of you you get the same you
[57:16] know it join HS join HS with Christ if
[57:20] so be that we suffer with him that we
[57:23] may also be glor
[57:25] glorified
[57:27] together together that's right Verse 18
[57:31] for I reckon that the suffering of this
[57:33] present time are not worthy to be
[57:36] compared with the glory which shall be
[57:40] revealed in
[57:41] us that's just like that's just
[57:43] phenomenal so it says he the glory that
[57:45] shall be revealed in us now it's totally
[57:48] amazing and there's three points that I
[57:50] want to quickly make known or just to
[57:52] note there's three little things in this
[57:54] one little verse that we want in this
[57:56] one sentence that we want to just pause
[57:59] on look first thing is the glory that
[58:03] shall okay we're going to split it up it
[58:05] says the glory that shall shall is kind
[58:07] of
[58:08] 100% we can't change it shall is like
[58:12] you know that's it it's setting Stone
[58:13] it's Concrete in that's it shall okay
[58:16] the glory that shall no room for change
[58:19] okay second point is be
[58:23] revealed okay
[58:25] okay so the glory is being
[58:29] revealed it's being
[58:31] unveiled and the third point is in
[58:36] US in US so there is a glory that has to
[58:40] 100% he can't change there is a glory
[58:42] that has to be revealed in the bride of
[58:46] Christ you know let's
[58:48] just pop a scripture in here just to
[58:50] raise the veil a little bit let's turn
[58:52] to 1 Corinthians 11 1 1 Corinthians
[58:56] 11 1 Corinthians 11:7 and
[58:59] 8 I love this
[59:03] one 1 Corinthians 7 and
[59:05] 8 says for a man indeed ought not to
[59:08] cover his head for as much as he is the
[59:11] image remember in the beginning the Lord
[59:13] made image in man in his own image okay
[59:16] for for a man ought not to cover his
[59:19] head for as much as he's the image and
[59:21] glory of God but the woman is the glory
[59:24] of the man for the man is not of the
[59:27] woman but the woman of the
[59:29] man you
[59:31] know the woman is the glory of the
[59:34] man think about this the woman is the
[59:37] glory of the man you know I um I
[59:40] ministered to place once and uh it was
[59:42] it was beautiful it was beautiful and um
[59:44] I preached on um uh that's right the the
[59:48] the the harvest is the uh the Harvest is
[59:51] the glory of the wheat or something I
[59:54] think it was long Minds The yeah the
[59:56] Harvest is the glory of the of the grain
[59:58] or the corn whatever the point is is
[1:00:01] that when a seed abideth alone it's just
[1:00:02] a seed and brother John if he plants out
[1:00:05] his his oat seeds it's just a handful
[1:00:07] it's like yeah big deal but that handful
[1:00:11] the True Glory of that handful of grain
[1:00:14] is the Harvest see see the True Glory of
[1:00:18] the Lord's seed being cast out on the
[1:00:21] earth is the Harvest that's right it's
[1:00:23] beautiful so so then then the woman
[1:00:25] we've just ready the woman's the glory
[1:00:27] of the man so we've just got just think
[1:00:29] about these few things here now we've
[1:00:31] got we've got the woman's the glory of
[1:00:33] the man then we've got the no longer
[1:00:36] Twain but the one amen and then we've
[1:00:38] got the glory that shall be revealed in
[1:00:41] us that's right and then we've got the
[1:00:43] glory that's a for prepared that's right
[1:00:45] and if you kind join them all up then
[1:00:46] it's
[1:00:48] woohoo look holding these thoughts in
[1:00:51] our hand let's turn to Ephesians 1 we
[1:00:54] all know this scripture Ephesians 1 3
[1:00:56] and
[1:00:59] 4 Ephesians 1 3 and 4 blessed be the God
[1:01:03] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:01:04] ha blessed us with all spiritual
[1:01:06] blessings blessed remember blessed is
[1:01:08] past tense Ed at the end means past
[1:01:10] tense has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:01:14] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:01:18] according as he hath chosen
[1:01:22] Us in him
[1:01:25] before the foundation of the world that
[1:01:27] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:01:29] before him in
[1:01:31] love that's uh the Lord's showing us
[1:01:34] here that he chose
[1:01:36] us in him before the foundation of the
[1:01:40] world so now immediately when I was a
[1:01:42] kid and I heard before the F it was
[1:01:46] like cuz your mind just goes you know I
[1:01:49] mean and I can't I can't I've got to be
[1:01:51] honest with you I can't imagine that
[1:01:53] long ago you know I can imagine like
[1:01:55] yesterday maybe the day before but you
[1:01:58] know before the foundation of the world
[1:02:00] this is the Lord's showing us here look
[1:02:01] before anything ever started I saw you
[1:02:04] coming down the aisle before this all
[1:02:06] started before even the first Star Wars
[1:02:09] before the first Angel was created
[1:02:11] before he was even God and the first he
[1:02:13] saw you coming down the aisle if he
[1:02:14] didn't he ain't the Alpha and the Omega
[1:02:16] and he's seen from the Omega he seeing
[1:02:19] you and he's he's showing his our
[1:02:21] position right he's showing the position
[1:02:23] of the Bride and her position has been
[1:02:26] given before the foundation of the world
[1:02:28] because before the foundation of the
[1:02:29] world he said two shall be become one
[1:02:32] that's right and if two is
[1:02:36] one then your position in Christ Jesus
[1:02:39] before the foundation before anything
[1:02:41] listen this whole thing all this it's
[1:02:43] about you sir creation oh it's beautiful
[1:02:47] and the leades falling oh it's just it's
[1:02:49] about you it's about you it's to speak
[1:02:51] to you for you look everything was given
[1:02:55] before the foundation of the world and
[1:02:56] you know we know that the two are no
[1:02:58] longer two but one so the Lord's
[1:03:00] pointing us back to where the starting
[1:03:04] point of our promise when it was given
[1:03:07] we could read there in verse chapter 12
[1:03:08] of Genesis when the Lord first gave the
[1:03:11] promise to Abraham but the Lord's
[1:03:13] pointing us back a bit further than that
[1:03:15] he's pointing us back to before the
[1:03:17] foundation when we were chosen in him to
[1:03:19] be joint Earth to become one with him
[1:03:21] that the two shall no longer be two but
[1:03:22] going to be one amen
[1:03:25] it's where our position in Christ
[1:03:26] started now notice we were not chosen by
[1:03:29] him we were chosen in him I hate to
[1:03:33] break this to you Simon but you can't
[1:03:35] choose how many fingers you've got you
[1:03:39] know what I mean I can't I can't choose
[1:03:41] I'd love to have like seven might make
[1:03:43] me more spiritual but you know I haven't
[1:03:45] I've got five I had no choice CU guess
[1:03:47] what when I was in the womb when I was
[1:03:49] in what I at was five we can't change
[1:03:52] that see see this this promise we
[1:03:55] couldn't change he's pointing us back to
[1:03:56] this immovable promise that we had no
[1:03:59] control over and this is the whole point
[1:04:00] this this raising of the veil in showing
[1:04:02] us who we are and where we are you know
[1:04:05] we talking about we're talking brother
[1:04:08] Jeremy last night about this the life
[1:04:09] lived there's got to be the Christian
[1:04:11] Life lived it's got to be some folks
[1:04:13] seem to think it's kind of like a thing
[1:04:14] in the past oh yeah she'll be right
[1:04:16] Carry On It Won't Be Right you see but
[1:04:18] if you've got that life in you if his
[1:04:20] life is in you then you're automatically
[1:04:22] going to live that life because it's not
[1:04:24] your life it's no longer I that liveth
[1:04:26] but Christ that liveth in me that's
[1:04:27] right see what I mean the Lord's good
[1:04:30] okay let's go a little bit further now
[1:04:33] now Abraham's bride and I love this and
[1:04:37] I hope you catch it straight away
[1:04:39] Abraham's bride was chosen by God to be
[1:04:44] to to manifest to further manifest
[1:04:50] Abraham okay Abraham's bride was chosen
[1:04:54] CH to further manifest Abraham that's
[1:04:57] right so further manifestation of
[1:04:59] Abraham it included to be father
[1:05:02] grandfather but also included the grand
[1:05:04] grand grand grand grandfather it was the
[1:05:06] king it was the Nations gener
[1:05:08] generations of the S of the sea
[1:05:10] everything was in there just go back to
[1:05:12] Genesis 17 Genesis
[1:05:16] 17 sorry that we're flipping around I'm
[1:05:18] not I'm not sorry I enjoy flipping
[1:05:19] around the
[1:05:20] scriptures Genesis 17 we're going to
[1:05:22] read 6 and 7 again
[1:05:25] let just read that this is the uh when
[1:05:29] when when he comes back to to promise to
[1:05:31] Abraham so he says and I what did I say
[1:05:33] 6 to 7 and I will make thee exceedingly
[1:05:35] fruitful and I will make nations of thee
[1:05:37] and Kings shall come out of thee and I
[1:05:39] will establish my Covenant between thee
[1:05:42] me and thee and thy seed after thee in
[1:05:45] their generations for an Everlasting
[1:05:48] Covenant to be a god unto thee and thy
[1:05:49] seed forever notice I've just seen that
[1:05:52] now actually but at the beginning here
[1:05:54] here in Abraham 12
[1:05:58] um up here the the Covenant was given
[1:06:01] you see in in Abraham 12 but now he says
[1:06:03] I'm going to establish my Covenant okay
[1:06:06] let's leave that one right so so look we
[1:06:07] see that all these further
[1:06:08] manifestations we've just read here okay
[1:06:11] they are they are in they're a part of
[1:06:14] Abraham's promise I don't want you to I
[1:06:15] don't want you to miss this now but all
[1:06:17] these things that are listed here they
[1:06:19] had one channel that they could come
[1:06:21] through Abraham's bride that's right yes
[1:06:24] everything that Abraham was and ever
[1:06:27] would be had to come through that
[1:06:29] channel which was Abraham's bride she
[1:06:32] was the chosen vessel that's right right
[1:06:36] The Chosen vessel to fulfill the further
[1:06:39] manifestation of Abraham I love that sir
[1:06:41] so now Abraham's bride is chosen okay
[1:06:44] now Abraham was given a
[1:06:46] promise and the promise couldn't be
[1:06:49] changed it could no in no wise ever be
[1:06:51] changed Sarah an only only Sarah was the
[1:06:55] chosen vessel no no one else no one else
[1:06:57] just read um 15 and 16 from Genesis 17
[1:07:00] 15- 16 just over the
[1:07:02] page and God said unto Abraham as for
[1:07:05] Sarai thy wife Thou shalt not call her
[1:07:08] name Sarai but Sarah shall be her name
[1:07:12] and I will bless her and give thee a son
[1:07:15] also of her yay I will bless her and she
[1:07:18] shall be a mother of Nations Kings of
[1:07:20] the people shall be of her amen the
[1:07:23] Lord's good yes sir
[1:07:26] so getting lost here so now even
[1:07:29] Abraham's bride because she's Abraham's
[1:07:31] bride even when she slipped and fell
[1:07:34] that would be in the next couple of
[1:07:35] verses even when she lied in God's
[1:07:40] face think of anybody else this is for
[1:07:43] the young guys now how do we do this
[1:07:45] brother Chad
[1:07:47] mate anybody else would
[1:07:52] be
[1:07:56] it's true move back to the more
[1:07:59] spiritual
[1:08:02] side just think about it Sarah lies in
[1:08:05] God's
[1:08:08] face anybody else would be no second
[1:08:12] chance but because the two shall be
[1:08:16] one right because she was in him at the
[1:08:20] point of the promise being
[1:08:22] given the Lord couldn't touch Sarah
[1:08:25] without hurting Abraham amen you see
[1:08:28] when Adam saw Eve okay and we were
[1:08:32] talking about this with brother Chad
[1:08:35] last week and see we say Eve but brother
[1:08:38] Chad was right when when when Adam saw
[1:08:42] Eve she wasn't called Eve you called
[1:08:44] their name Adam but when Adam saw her
[1:08:48] I'll read it actually Genesis 2 we've
[1:08:50] got a little bit of time I hope Genesis
[1:08:52] 2:21 to 24 Genesis 2 21-
[1:08:57] 24 it's it's it's very
[1:08:59] nice Genesis 221 to
[1:09:02] 24 and the Lord caused a deep sleep to
[1:09:06] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[1:09:10] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[1:09:12] thereof instead thereof and the rib
[1:09:15] which the Lord God had taken from man
[1:09:18] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[1:09:20] man now listen it's beautiful because
[1:09:23] you know when the Lord Jesus Christ was
[1:09:24] smitten on Calvary the bride came
[1:09:27] out we'll read that later on that's
[1:09:29] stunning that's just stunning see the
[1:09:31] Lord sets out these types that just keep
[1:09:34] following through and what is it
[1:09:35] pointing us back to who we are verse 23
[1:09:39] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[1:09:42] bone Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[1:09:44] called woman because she was taken out
[1:09:47] of the man therefore shall a man leave
[1:09:50] his father and mother and shall cleave
[1:09:51] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:09:53] flesh
[1:09:54] so now when Adam sees Eve his wife his
[1:09:59] woman when he saw her he says now now
[1:10:02] this one this is the one this this one
[1:10:05] is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh
[1:10:07] it's this one and you know there was
[1:10:08] plenty of animals around there was loads
[1:10:11] of them but he didn't say oh it's that
[1:10:12] one over there he said it's this one he
[1:10:14] says this is the one right you know
[1:10:18] and this it was bone of his bone flesh
[1:10:21] he knew that that came from him
[1:10:24] and you know for Abraham it was the same
[1:10:27] Abraham it was the same if the Lord had
[1:10:28] touched Sarah smitten Sarah a part of
[1:10:32] Abraham would have died that's right you
[1:10:34] see and then the promise couldn't be
[1:10:36] fulfilled because the promise the
[1:10:38] channel for that promise was
[1:10:40] Sarah so you couldn't touch Abraham
[1:10:43] because now Abraham knew and the Lord
[1:10:45] knew that this that she was bone of
[1:10:47] Abraham's bone flesh of his flesh that's
[1:10:49] right I'd like to read this beautiful
[1:10:52] quote um it's Abraham's Covenant
[1:10:55] confirmed and you know as as we read
[1:10:57] this you
[1:11:00] see you see how the the brother Ram is
[1:11:03] is is is showing this perfect type of
[1:11:05] Abraham and Sarah and Christ and the
[1:11:07] bride he's he's showing it now and I've
[1:11:10] done it in in orange and yellow and
[1:11:13] orange so that you can see it and when
[1:11:15] it's in Orange when it's in yellow he's
[1:11:17] talking about Abraham and Sarah and when
[1:11:19] he's in Orange he's talking about the
[1:11:20] Bri and the bride and then Abraham and
[1:11:22] Sarah and Christ and the bride he's
[1:11:24] flipping between the two because he so
[1:11:27] perfect brother says it's Abraham's
[1:11:29] Covenant confirmed it's
[1:11:31] 190 says when Sarah doubted God God
[1:11:35] would have got rid of her but he
[1:11:36] couldn't do it why she's a part of
[1:11:39] Abraham and now he flips on to Christ
[1:11:41] and the bride that's the reason when we
[1:11:43] do wrong God would slay us I would never
[1:11:46] come here to preach uh preacher Revival
[1:11:48] no other preacher could you'd never have
[1:11:50] a Revival you'd be cut off forever but
[1:11:51] he can't do it he cuts his own son if
[1:11:55] off if he does see be for the wife is a
[1:11:59] part of the husband they are no longer
[1:12:01] Twain but they're one and now he flips
[1:12:04] back to Abraham and Sarah so he couldn't
[1:12:07] have hurt Sarah without hurting Abraham
[1:12:09] so he had to take Sarah
[1:12:11] in then back to the bride that's the way
[1:12:14] God would does to us our sins he depart
[1:12:17] he he depart from us a long ago but
[1:12:20] we're in Christ amen see so he forgives
[1:12:24] us our sins Sarah all her mistakes see
[1:12:28] this constant just this flipping between
[1:12:31] because it's this perfect type the Lord
[1:12:34] can't Smite his bride without smiting
[1:12:37] himself when Adam saw Eve he saw himself
[1:12:41] and he said this is the one this one
[1:12:44] this is bone of my bone this is Flesh of
[1:12:45] My Flesh this is the one you know and
[1:12:48] when he said that it also then
[1:12:50] automatically he was laying the
[1:12:52] precedent I think that's the word for
[1:12:54] things to come and it included Abraham
[1:12:56] he was pointing to Abraham and Sarah
[1:12:59] he's pointing to Christ and the bride
[1:13:00] when he says this is bone of my bone
[1:13:02] Flesh of My Flesh that's right now
[1:13:04] notice when Eve
[1:13:06] fell okay when Eve fell she was still a
[1:13:09] part of Adam mhm she was still in fact
[1:13:14] when she fell she was still
[1:13:16] Adam so when she fell she was still a
[1:13:19] part of Adam and when he saw her in that
[1:13:22] Fallen
[1:13:24] State okay he had to walk out with her
[1:13:28] it's the perfect type of Christ in the
[1:13:30] bride because when Christ was on the
[1:13:31] cross he saw us all and he saw us in our
[1:13:35] fallen State and he went out and paid
[1:13:37] that ultimate price it cost Adam his
[1:13:39] life so now we'll just read we'll read
[1:13:42] from rising of the
[1:13:44] sun just read where Brother Talks in
[1:13:46] Rising of the sun this is beautiful
[1:13:49] absolutely says but God foresaw the
[1:13:51] bride in the groom Hallelujah see to
[1:13:55] save his wife like Adam he had to go
[1:13:58] with her Adam knowed what he was doing
[1:14:01] Eve didn't know what she was doing did
[1:14:03] you know what you were doing when you
[1:14:04] were sinning no you didn't did you no
[1:14:07] you didn't no no see Eve didn't know
[1:14:09] what she was doing but Adam walked out
[1:14:11] with his wife see and Jesus took his
[1:14:15] wife's place and became sin for her
[1:14:19] remember he became you he stood your
[1:14:22] punishment
[1:14:24] that you might stand in his place he
[1:14:26] stood in your place that you might stand
[1:14:28] in his place what a love what a
[1:14:31] fellowship it's phenomenal and so now
[1:14:36] remember that Eve was the further she
[1:14:40] was the channel through which the
[1:14:42] further manifestation of Adam was going
[1:14:44] to
[1:14:45] come there was no she was that chosen
[1:14:48] vessel she was the chosen vessel and so
[1:14:52] the further manifestation of of Abraham
[1:14:54] had to come through his bride which
[1:14:56] would be Sarah and so you know how is
[1:14:58] the Lord Jesus going to further manifest
[1:15:02] himself H see when how's he going to
[1:15:05] further reveal himself that's right it's
[1:15:07] going to be through his bride that's
[1:15:09] right and you know when you start to you
[1:15:11] go from being a young Christian maybe 20
[1:15:14] I was raised in a Christian and oh yeah
[1:15:16] yeah yeah oh I'm bride yeah sweet yeah
[1:15:18] I'm sweet it's like no you don't know
[1:15:20] who you are see the closer sorry sorry
[1:15:24] guys the closer you get to it it's like
[1:15:26] this is it it's a bit like me preaching
[1:15:29] this morning it's like you know I'm
[1:15:31] scared of heights I'd love to go one of
[1:15:32] those like flying fox things and I saw
[1:15:34] it there in the thing and I thought oh
[1:15:36] man I'd love to go but I know when I get
[1:15:37] to the top I look down it's
[1:15:40] like that's how it was this morning she
[1:15:43] like brother CH oh you would you I oh
[1:15:45] yep that's fine Lord if that's what
[1:15:46] you've got and then you get here it's
[1:15:52] just oh the Lord's good but you see when
[1:15:55] you get here that's it this is it now
[1:15:57] this is it now there's a time when it
[1:15:59] gets serious there's a time when that's
[1:16:01] it now and we when we get to that point
[1:16:03] as the bride when we realize what it
[1:16:06] means suddenly it's like you know what
[1:16:10] if I'm going to carry his name if I'm
[1:16:12] going to be his bride if I'm going to be
[1:16:13] joint hirs with him if I him if the two
[1:16:17] are no longer one if if they're two if
[1:16:19] they're one then I better start acting
[1:16:22] like that
[1:16:24] you know then when when he places his
[1:16:25] word seed in us and and and and what
[1:16:28] what the bride's carrying then is
[1:16:29] actually a reproduction of the father
[1:16:34] and if we've got the father's seed in us
[1:16:35] then who we better be careful how we
[1:16:37] carry
[1:16:38] that let's just read spoken word is the
[1:16:41] Original
[1:16:42] Seed lord is good I just said to brother
[1:16:46] well down in Jeffersonville the uh a
[1:16:48] brother showed us around the church this
[1:16:50] is a six-hour sermon this one and the
[1:16:52] brother was saying you know brother Bron
[1:16:54] splits it into two halves and um it's
[1:16:57] phenomenal he he said I said we we'll
[1:16:59] break up we'll have lunch you get all
[1:17:01] have your lunch and come back and when
[1:17:03] brother Ram came back apparently the
[1:17:05] people were still sat in the same chair
[1:17:06] they'd never even moved that all that
[1:17:08] time unbelievable see the Lord is good
[1:17:12] and uh we don't mind sitting and
[1:17:13] listening to the word the word is good
[1:17:15] it's it's him it's him in us there just
[1:17:17] that we want more of him more of him so
[1:17:20] let's just read here he says he is the
[1:17:23] seed word in his body and he in US
[1:17:27] becomes the seed word in us what all God
[1:17:31] was he poured into Christ and all Christ
[1:17:33] was he was poured into the church that's
[1:17:36] the power Just how about all the God was
[1:17:40] he poured into Christ all that Christ
[1:17:42] was he poured into the church May that
[1:17:46] is a high calling yes that is that's
[1:17:49] like now when you read that that's when
[1:17:51] you're standing at the front and and
[1:17:53] it's okay yeah this is it now this is it
[1:17:55] now this is this is like serious I'm
[1:17:57] walking out of here with a different
[1:17:59] name and if I walk out of here
[1:18:01] differently I can't be the same girl
[1:18:04] like I used to be I can't act the same
[1:18:07] anymore cuz now I'm married I've got to
[1:18:09] be it's a different calling and we walk
[1:18:11] out a different person and so when we
[1:18:13] read this all that God was he poured
[1:18:16] into Christ and all Christ was he
[1:18:17] pouring into the church that's the power
[1:18:19] that is power right now watch remember
[1:18:23] God's law of reproduction now listen
[1:18:25] reproduction this word reproduction
[1:18:27] speaks of further
[1:18:30] manifestation further manifestation okay
[1:18:33] speaks of furtherment so remember God's
[1:18:35] law of reproduction now remember after
[1:18:38] its kind is that right the seed of
[1:18:40] Christ the word must come through his
[1:18:44] body whoa whoa whoa he said not the body
[1:18:46] of his bride he just said his body
[1:18:49] that's right which is his bride that's
[1:18:51] right his body it's got to come through
[1:18:53] his body oh are you getting tired all
[1:18:54] right just a minute now just hold quiet
[1:18:56] and pray I want you to get this real
[1:18:58] good he's wanting us to get this good
[1:19:00] amen I want you to get this real good I
[1:19:01] want this to grind down the seed of
[1:19:04] Christ must m u s t he spells it out
[1:19:07] must come through his body and he must
[1:19:11] have shouted his cuz it's Capital both
[1:19:14] not through a denomination but through a
[1:19:16] born again seed of the word it must come
[1:19:19] through now remember what is it Christ's
[1:19:22] seed how does how does my seed come
[1:19:25] through the body how does the apple tree
[1:19:27] seed come through the body the seed is
[1:19:29] through the body and church the church
[1:19:32] listen the church is the body of Christ
[1:19:36] is that right the Bible Church not just
[1:19:39] any church he he says the bible
[1:19:42] church pardon
[1:19:45] me see God's law of reproduction the
[1:19:49] seed has to come through his own body he
[1:19:51] can't come through another one
[1:19:54] Abraham's seed had to say this is it
[1:19:55] this one this is my body this is bone of
[1:19:57] my bone this is it's this one my my seed
[1:20:00] my furtherment has to come through this
[1:20:02] one Abraham said this is bone my bone my
[1:20:05] fesh this is Sarah this is the one this
[1:20:06] is and the Lord Jesus is saying this is
[1:20:08] the one this is my body my bone my bone
[1:20:10] flesh My
[1:20:11] Flesh that's right Jonathan's giggling
[1:20:14] at me this is my
[1:20:17] body the Lord's
[1:20:19] good it's funny when there's somebody
[1:20:21] else there and some might say something
[1:20:22] funny it's all good but the Lord is good
[1:20:25] you see the Lord's chosen us to carry
[1:20:28] his seed the furtherment so now the seed
[1:20:32] coming through the body it's talking of
[1:20:34] a further manifestation or a furtherment
[1:20:38] of okay so I've got three kids guess
[1:20:41] what they came through me they came
[1:20:42] through my body yeah which would be my
[1:20:44] wife and I can see all these beautiful
[1:20:46] families here and guess what brother
[1:20:48] Jonathan Samuel he's a furtherment of
[1:20:52] brother Jonathan and there's those like
[1:20:54] brother Chad's got grandchildren now
[1:20:55] where's little Henry is it back
[1:20:56] somewhere little Henry is he he's part
[1:20:59] of the furtherment of brother Chad see
[1:21:01] brother Chad brother Blake little Henry
[1:21:03] see what I mean it's this furtherment
[1:21:05] and as time would go on it would get
[1:21:06] bigger and bigger so this seed that
[1:21:09] the's talking about here is this further
[1:21:11] manifestation now notice if you plant a
[1:21:14] corn seed you're not only just going to
[1:21:16] you're not going to get a potato you're
[1:21:18] going to get a corn but you know brother
[1:21:20] um John I'm talking about brother John a
[1:21:23] lot because we've been staying with him
[1:21:24] but brother John took me out to go and
[1:21:25] see his cornfield and he planted this
[1:21:27] purple maze in like six rows on the
[1:21:30] outside it's some organic stuff that he
[1:21:32] wants to keep right so he said I said
[1:21:35] well why did you put it on that side he
[1:21:36] said oh cuz the wind comes that way so
[1:21:39] the wind's blowing across the field from
[1:21:41] that side it's all just a yellow Maze
[1:21:43] and there's six rows or 12 whatever it
[1:21:45] is on the right hand side the wind blows
[1:21:48] across if the wind of denomination and
[1:21:51] junk manmade blows across the church
[1:21:54] you're going to end up with mixed up
[1:21:56] stuff am well this wind blew across and
[1:21:59] even to the furthest point of the field
[1:22:01] isn't that right with John there's corn
[1:22:02] that's got little bits of purple on
[1:22:05] because of this cross pollination is
[1:22:07] that right this cross pollination just
[1:22:09] from the wind blowing the the seed of
[1:22:12] the purple one all the way across it's
[1:22:14] really cool but if you plant a purple
[1:22:17] seed you're actually going to get a
[1:22:18] purple seed as long as you Shield it
[1:22:20] from anything else it's going to give
[1:22:22] this purple seed so ju so just like
[1:22:25] Abraham now Abraham his further
[1:22:27] manifestation was Abraham it was all it
[1:22:30] was a part of Abraham and it came
[1:22:32] through his bride who was a part of him
[1:22:34] it was his body it had to come through
[1:22:35] his body and brother Ram shows us how
[1:22:38] that the church is the chosen vessel
[1:22:41] okay for this seed word to become
[1:22:44] manifested want to read another quote
[1:22:46] here is from um the same spoken word as
[1:22:48] Original
[1:22:49] Seed this is I love this because it's a
[1:22:52] um
[1:22:53] uh I've already read it I think that's
[1:22:56] right I'll read it again this is the
[1:22:57] same quote again he says now remember
[1:22:59] what is it Christ's seed how does my
[1:23:01] seed come through through the body how
[1:23:03] does apple tree seed come through
[1:23:04] through the body seed of the body and
[1:23:06] the church is the body of Christ is that
[1:23:08] right the Bible Church that's when he
[1:23:10] says that the Bible Church so all that
[1:23:12] God was he poured into Christ all that
[1:23:15] Christ was he poured into his body see
[1:23:19] he says here at the the topic says all
[1:23:21] all that was in Christ pour it into the
[1:23:23] church and now down the B he's showing
[1:23:24] us again we know this already but he's
[1:23:26] just reiterating the fact that the
[1:23:27] church is his
[1:23:29] body so he pours it into his body which
[1:23:32] is he's pouring in this seed which is
[1:23:35] the further manifestation the
[1:23:37] furtherment of
[1:23:39] himself and the
[1:23:41] body is you it's you listen the veil is
[1:23:46] being
[1:23:47] raised and you know you start to realize
[1:23:50] the gravity of the situation you start
[1:23:53] to realize the gravity of what it means
[1:23:56] you're going to leave in a different
[1:23:58] name you're going to leave with a
[1:24:01] different
[1:24:02] life you know you you've been chosen
[1:24:04] she's the bride is the chosen one to
[1:24:08] carry the further manifestation of
[1:24:10] himself you you've been chosen to
[1:24:12] manifest his life to carry his life the
[1:24:16] Lord's chosen his bride to show all his
[1:24:19] attributes ah yes that was brother Ram's
[1:24:22] life life that's nice what about you you
[1:24:25] know you it seems like some folks that
[1:24:28] want to pin everything on on on brother
[1:24:29] bam or on the pastor and that what about
[1:24:32] you you see it's nice that the pastor
[1:24:35] goes in in the Rapture what about you
[1:24:37] what about you you know listen I am just
[1:24:41] one of you brother Chad's one of you
[1:24:42] we're part of this body brother Chad's
[1:24:44] been preaching about the body you can't
[1:24:45] live without the rest of the body and if
[1:24:48] one of you is missing on the other side
[1:24:50] the body isn't complete that's right cuz
[1:24:52] if I chop off a tiny fingernail that my
[1:24:55] body's not complete you know I've got a
[1:24:58] few hairs missing you know but my body
[1:25:02] isn't complete now it was at some point

[1:25:14] himself into his body and from the life
[1:25:16] of brother Bram and for the life of the

[1:29:21] about seeing our position in him it
[1:29:23] truly takes on a new level takes on a
[1:29:25] new level let's just read here uh it's
[1:29:28] it's it's pick up your pen it's the
[1:29:30] same it says then from a little group of
[1:29:32] the true seed of the word God will
[1:29:36] present Christ a beloved bride a virgin
[1:29:39] a virgin of his word and through them
[1:29:42] and by them will be fulfilled all that
[1:29:45] has been promised for his word in the
[1:29:47] Virgin who knows no man-made Creeds or
[1:29:49] dogmas the Word of Promise in himself
[1:29:53] remember remember this listen The Word
[1:29:54] of Promise in himself do you remember we
[1:29:56] read um Ephesians 1 that we were chosen
[1:29:59] in him from before the our promise was
[1:30:02] given that Word of Promise was given
[1:30:03] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:30:05] and here he's talking the Lord's telling
[1:30:07] him he say the Word of Promise in
[1:30:08] himself like it was in Mary God himself
[1:30:10] made manifest he will act himself by his
[1:30:14] own Word of Promise so to fulfill all
[1:30:17] that's been written of him whoa he's
[1:30:19] talking about your life here he's
[1:30:21] talking about your life that you are
[1:30:23] going to fulfill all that's written of
[1:30:24] him read
[1:30:26] it as he did when he came from the
[1:30:28] Virgin womb type of the spirit womb now
[1:30:30] so will the Virgin now accepting his
[1:30:31] word be it unto me as thou are said
[1:30:34] though it was said by an Angel and while
[1:30:36] it was yet written word Isaiah 9 they
[1:30:38] will love him and will have his
[1:30:42] potentials for he is their head and they
[1:30:45] are his subjects subject to his head
[1:30:48] headship of Christ was his goes back
[1:30:51] down down one paragraph he says here is
[1:30:53] the secret the word is in the bride
[1:30:57] listen listen the word is in the bride
[1:31:00] and the mind of Christ to know what he
[1:31:02] wants done with the word and she does it
[1:31:06] in his name she has thus sayith the Lord
[1:31:11] listen uh J I've got to pick on you
[1:31:14] sorry
[1:31:15] bro but you know um Riley is is Riley
[1:31:19] Sanders okay so when comes
[1:31:23] in then she's going to
[1:31:25] have is it no so is that
[1:31:29] right I'm terrible with this she comes
[1:31:32] in listen she takes his name listen
[1:31:34] carefully when she goes out from that
[1:31:37] point she does everything in his name am
[1:31:40] that's right every action that she ever
[1:31:43] does is now done in his name that's
[1:31:45] right you see and if we're the Bride of
[1:31:47] the Lord Jesus Christ then Absol without
[1:31:50] even thinking about it every every
[1:31:52] single thing we do is in his name
[1:31:55] am to carry on reading here it says they
[1:31:58] will only do his
[1:32:01] will I believe that no one can persuade
[1:32:04] them different they have thus saith the
[1:32:07] Lord he's talking about
[1:32:08] you and this is even pick up your pen so
[1:32:12] we we this is this is the Lord is just
[1:32:13] telling you how he sees you talk about
[1:32:15] seeing through the word talk about the
[1:32:17] veil swinging but now you get there the
[1:32:18] veil lifts and you can see who you are
[1:32:21] he says no no one comp them different
[1:32:22] they have thus saith the Lord or they
[1:32:24] keep still they will do the works of God
[1:32:27] for it is himself in them
[1:32:31] continuing his word to fulfill as he did
[1:32:35] complete in his days all things when he
[1:32:38] was here he did not complete all when he
[1:32:40] was here for it was not yet time so we
[1:32:43] can see that the bride has been
[1:32:45] chosen to fulfill the rest of what
[1:32:48] hasn't been done it's the further
[1:32:51] furtherment it's this further
[1:32:53] manifestation it's amazing the bride
[1:32:55] will have thus sayith the Lord or shall
[1:32:57] keep still it's him manifesting himself
[1:33:00] in
[1:33:01] you you know we're at the we're at the
[1:33:03] point when when this Veil is being
[1:33:06] raised you know we're not seeing blurry
[1:33:08] anymore the bride has been chosen to
[1:33:11] further manifest it can't see any more
[1:33:13] black and white further manifest the
[1:33:15] Lord
[1:33:15] Jesus you know she's the The Chosen
[1:33:20] vessel and the Lord's saying this one
[1:33:22] not another one it's this one this is
[1:33:24] the one this is bone my bone this is the
[1:33:26] one when when when when when when I was
[1:33:28] put to sleep and she came out of my side
[1:33:30] just like Adam this is the one this is
[1:33:32] the one the two are one chosen to the
[1:33:36] point where she will have thus sayith
[1:33:38] the Lord that means that when she speaks
[1:33:40] it's him speaking through cuz the only
[1:33:41] way that you can have thus sayith the
[1:33:43] Lord is if it's him speaking
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:46] amen he's in her living out through her
[1:33:48] she's the chosen vessel just like Sarah
[1:33:51] when we saw the Abraham and Sarah you
[1:33:53] know and if we stumble a mistake like
[1:33:55] Sarah there's forgiveness there's
[1:33:57] forgiveness because when he sees you he
[1:33:59] sees
[1:34:00] himself he sees himself because Adam
[1:34:03] said this is my bone of my bone Flesh of
[1:34:05] My Flesh it pointed to the Lord and his
[1:34:07] bride one last quote actually I'm just
[1:34:10] going to squeeze this one
[1:34:11] in it's from the rising of the
[1:34:15] Sun and this is beautiful because I love
[1:34:18] that with Adam when Adam was uh you you
[1:34:21] know put to sleep and the bride was
[1:34:23] taken from his from his
[1:34:27] side says here but
[1:34:30] remember he went there to Calvary he
[1:34:33] went there with you in him see God had
[1:34:37] never SE I love this God had never
[1:34:40] separated the bride from the groom yet
[1:34:44] so when God looked down upon the body of
[1:34:46] Christ he saw both male and female it
[1:34:50] was all redeemed in that one body see
[1:34:54] they are one the same the same word the
[1:34:58] same word spoke of the groom speaks of
[1:35:00] the Bride that is phenomenal so even
[1:35:04] when we fall stumble and
[1:35:06] fall he can't Smite the bride he can
[1:35:08] correct the bride he can chastise the
[1:35:11] bride am but he can't Smite the bride
[1:35:14] you know she's a part of him
[1:35:17] and if we can just see how many precious
[1:35:21] prom that we're a part of they're all
[1:35:24] pertain to us everything ey has not seen
[1:35:27] Ear Has Not Heard what's in store for us
[1:35:30] and you know it hasn't even entered into
[1:35:32] the heart of man what's prepared for us
[1:35:34] and sometimes I've said before in the
[1:35:36] past you know I think you know like
[1:35:40] there's some islands these these these
[1:35:42] crazy islands that people build you know
[1:35:44] if you get like some gazillionaire and
[1:35:46] you buy an island all to yourself and
[1:35:48] you build like this this stupidly stupid
[1:35:51] stuff it's just
[1:35:53] like but even though all that's there
[1:35:55] and like paradise just like par it's
[1:35:57] like but that's nothing you know even
[1:36:00] with all men's trying he cannot even
[1:36:04] enter into his heart what the Lord's got
[1:36:06] for us it can't even imagine what he's
[1:36:09] got in store for us you know and we
[1:36:13] can't imagine the glory that shall be
[1:36:15] revealed in you and it has to because it
[1:36:18] shall be revealed that means listen
[1:36:24] what's behind this piece of paper okay
[1:36:26] what's behind here you don't know dear
[1:36:29] I'm going to reveal it to
[1:36:31] you and now it's revealed see it's
[1:36:34] revealed you see but it was always there
[1:36:38] the P it was always there so to reveal
[1:36:40] something means that it's actually there
[1:36:43] and you're tearing off the cover of it
[1:36:45] so the glory that shall be revealed in
[1:36:48] you it's already there and he's gently
[1:36:50] tearing it away and he's raising up his
[1:36:52] bride of the last day and you will walk
[1:36:55] in his footsteps you will walk you will
[1:36:57] live that life you will be that
[1:36:59] testimony it's what you're called to do
[1:37:01] and he said You shall live that life the
[1:37:03] glory that is in you you might feel
[1:37:05] junky you might just say oh I've got no
[1:37:07] job and I've just this whoa whoa whoa

[1:39:16] Lord because you chose fishermen you
[1:39:19] chose this one that one
[1:39:21] Lord Jesus we're nothing Lord in this
[1:39:23] world we are nothing Lord Jesus but we
[1:39:25] just want to live for you and Lord Jesus
[1:39:28] we're just so thankful Lord you've
[1:39:30] chosen us to a glory it's not a glitzy
[1:39:32] Glory it's not a glory of the world it's
[1:39:35] a glory of you lord it's your
[1:39:37] manifestation I pray that if there's any
[1:39:40] here that that have their heart touched
[1:39:43] that they want to rededicate themselves
[1:39:44] to you Lord you know my story I
[1:39:47] rededicated myself Lord because I knew I
[1:39:50] wasn't quite right and I wanted to walk
[1:39:52] out of the building different I wanted
[1:39:54] to I realized I came to the position
[1:39:55] where I realized lord I can't go on
[1:39:59] anymore and so if there's any here Lord
[1:40:01] I pray Lord that you'll touch the heart
[1:40:03] and they'll rededicate themselves to you
[1:40:05] that they'll come before you and say
[1:40:06] Lord I want to leave this building
[1:40:07] carrying a new name I want to leave this
[1:40:09] building walking a different life maybe
[1:40:11] there's maybe May I'm sure that most all
[1:40:14] in here love you truly and and and
[1:40:17] they're your bride and but maybe some
[1:40:19] have just got that blurriness May maybe
[1:40:21] it's that Veil swinging Lord may they
[1:40:23] come Lord and ask you to raise the veil
[1:40:25] show them Lord because when we see who
[1:40:26] we are where we are Lord
[1:40:28] automatically when that life's in us we
[1:40:30] will walk right but we lord we've all
[1:40:32] been there we've all walked with that
[1:40:34] Veil swinging Lord and until we see
[1:40:37] clearly who we are we just love you Lord
[1:40:39] that's what we're asking we're asking
[1:40:40] you to raise the veil and I thank you
[1:40:42] Lord for those words just jumping out of
[1:40:44] me and touching my heart raising the
[1:40:46] veil as you just lifting the veil and

[1:41:47] I well I can see
[1:41:53] Lord who I
[1:41:57] am a part of my
[1:42:02] savior I'm a part of his
[1:42:07] word for it's
[1:42:10] re it's
[1:42:12] predestination oh it's
[1:42:17] predes all who I
[1:42:23] well Who I Am
[1:42:27] Lord yes who I
[1:42:32] am yes I can see
[1:42:37] now yes who I
[1:42:42] am a part of my
[1:42:47] savior a part of his
[1:42:53] it's a
[1:42:56] reation oh it's
[1:43:02] predestination of who I
[1:43:07] am oh praise God are you encouraged by
[1:43:11] the word amen do you feel like God
[1:43:13] lifted the veil a little more for you
[1:43:15] this morning he certainly did for me
[1:43:17] amen praise
[1:43:19] God
[1:43:25] amen that did me a world of
[1:43:28] good amen you see why we had to have a
[1:43:31] messenger in the end time why because we
[1:43:34] were seeing through a glass
[1:43:37] Darkly this this mirror of God's word
[1:43:40] that we were supposed to look through to
[1:43:41] see something it was dark it was obscure
[1:43:44] it was cloudy it was through through
[1:43:46] man's ideas being sprinkled in through
[1:43:49] thousands of years it had gotten obscure
[1:43:51] and it was hard to really see you could
[1:43:53] make out something brother B said they
[1:43:54] had enough light to see how to move
[1:43:56] forward but that was about it it was a
[1:43:59] gloomy day not day or night amen it was
[1:44:02] it was murky the glass was dark but oh
[1:44:05] God sent a perfect word at the end time
[1:44:08] Amen to clear away the obscurity to move
[1:44:10] away the darkness so you could clearly
[1:44:12] see through the word and what were you
[1:44:14] supposed to see when you saw through the
[1:44:15] word we thought when I see through this
[1:44:17] word I'll see Jesus Christ and that's
[1:44:20] exactly what we saw but we see him in
[1:44:22] female form now the manifestation of
[1:44:26] Christ in the end time when you look
[1:44:28] through this word is to see him in
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:34] her she's reflecting him now to the
[1:44:38] earth I say oh thank God you know it it
[1:44:43] had to come by the message there was no
[1:44:45] way there could be another
[1:44:47] reformer there could be it had to be a
[1:44:50] prophet that that can take us back to
[1:44:51] the original intent of God's word so
[1:44:54] that we could see and that's why these
[1:44:57] things have to be preached that's why we
[1:44:59] so bad need what we heard this morning
[1:45:01] because until it's preached it's still
[1:45:03] obscure in our hearts I mean we know the
[1:45:05] message is pure but we still need to see
[1:45:07] it like we should brother benam was
[1:45:09] preaching he says I know you're not
[1:45:11] getting it like you should he goes I'm
[1:45:13] not getting it like I
[1:45:15] should I'm not seeing it like I should
[1:45:18] hey the word's been given it's perfect
[1:45:20] amen but I'm still not seeing it like I
[1:45:23] should I want to see it all the way in
[1:45:25] the fullness of his glory in the
[1:45:26] Perfection because when I see it perfect
[1:45:29] I will see me perfect and whatever I see
[1:45:32] is how I will act and how I will
[1:45:34] behave that's what brother Simon was
[1:45:37] teaching us at the end once the
[1:45:38] realization comes of this truth it
[1:45:41] changes us it literally changes us it's
[1:45:45] not a you should try harder not to be
[1:45:48] like this and you should try harder to
[1:45:49] be like that hey we've went through
[1:45:51] generations of that and that has utterly
[1:45:53] failed but what we need is to look into
[1:45:55] the mirror correctly and see who we
[1:45:57] really are and when we see who we really
[1:45:59] are the action will follow the
[1:46:00] Revelation and it's no longer I'm trying
[1:46:02] not to do this and trying to do this
[1:46:04] it's just starting to come
[1:46:07] automatically and as the word lifts us
[1:46:09] higher and higher and higher amen that
[1:46:12] life starts to manifest more and more
[1:46:16] and
[1:46:17] more so glad he's still lifting the
[1:46:20] Veil so that we can see clearly if it
[1:46:24] wasn't for re re revelated preaching we
[1:46:27] would be
[1:46:28] stuck we would be stuck in trying we
[1:46:31] would be stuck in cycles that we've been
[1:46:33] in in the past we'd be stuck somewhere
[1:46:35] along the way but how does God keep us
[1:46:37] from getting stuck he keeps lifting the
[1:46:41] veil he keeps revealing the word is it
[1:46:45] the same thing we've been preaching yes
[1:46:46] it's the same but different is it the
[1:46:48] same tapes yes same tapes but different
[1:46:50] the same books we read same books same
[1:46:52] Bible yes but different why he's lifting
[1:46:54] the veil off of it amen so that we can
[1:46:58] see right I'm so thankful I'm so
[1:47:01] thankful this morning he's still
[1:47:04] lifting the veil I thankful he's given
[1:47:07] us eyes to see ears to hear and a heart
[1:47:11] to perceive all that he's given us this
[1:47:14] day but Simon was saying she'll have
[1:47:17] thus sayith the Lord or she'll keep
[1:47:19] still
[1:47:21] I've heard so many interpretations that
[1:47:22] will happen I don't know exactly what
[1:47:24] all going to happen as time continues on
[1:47:27] but I know one thing when it comes to
[1:47:29] the scriptures we've received the
[1:47:31] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:47:33] Divine Vindication we have thus sayith
[1:47:35] the Lord on the scriptures yeah and to
[1:47:38] me we can keep moving forward with this
[1:47:40] word and if it's not in the word I don't
[1:47:42] need to make up a new Creed or a new
[1:47:44] doctrine I'll just leave it alone cuz I
[1:47:46] already have thus sayeth the
[1:47:48] Lord and God can always give more
[1:47:50] through the gifts but this we know for
[1:47:53] sure we have thus sayeth the Lord on the
[1:47:56] scriptures without that I don't know
[1:47:58] some say it could be this way that may
[1:48:00] be that may be right but I don't know
[1:48:02] what I know is this is thus sayith the
[1:48:03] Lord and without that I'll keep
[1:48:06] still
[1:48:07] amen God is good to us let's just bow
[1:48:10] our heads together thank
[1:48:14] God lord Jesus we thank you God God we
[1:48:18] know without you we can do nothing
[1:48:20] Lord God we even the preaching of the
[1:48:23] word would be impossible without your
[1:48:25] anointing and your inspiration and your
[1:48:26] spirit so we thank you but Lord also to
[1:48:29] receive the word would be impossible
[1:48:31] Lord if you didn't put something in us
[1:48:32] to receive with and if you didn't open
[1:48:34] our ears and open our understanding and
[1:48:37] oh God you've been so faithful this
[1:48:39] morning Lord to speak to us your word
[1:48:41] but also to open our hearts to receive
[1:48:43] it Lord we're so thankful God I pray
[1:48:46] that everything that was preached would
[1:48:48] come to a manifestation in my my life
[1:48:50] Lord me personally I want to take it
[1:48:53] personally that the higher calling would
[1:48:55] come to a higher life because I see it
[1:48:57] in the word Lord I see what you're
[1:48:59] trying to tell me Lord I I I I it's
[1:49:02] becoming more real day by day it's
[1:49:04] becoming clearer service by Service uh

[1:49:10] God that you would continue to rub the
[1:49:12] eyes saav in my eyes that I might see

[1:49:17] as I yield my vessel to you that you'll
[1:49:19] take me Lord Lord and use me for your
[1:49:21] purpose in this hour God may you have
[1:49:24] preeminence for that's what you desire

[1:52:02] predestin can we sing on the road
[1:52:06] to I'd like to sing this song on the
[1:52:08] road to
[1:52:09] Emmas I think it's
[1:52:13] amazing on the road to
[1:52:15] emus there's a question in this verse
[1:52:18] how could he desire
[1:52:20] to have fellowship with
[1:52:22] me I love how brother John wrote the the
[1:52:25] other additional part cuz it it's no
[1:52:28] longer a question in this day like
[1:52:31] through the denominational ages there's
[1:52:33] such a question how could he desire to
[1:52:35] fellowship with me how could God want me
[1:52:37] and still that's our Earthly perspective
[1:52:39] that's the human natural perspective but
[1:52:42] oh we've been taken on Engles Wings a
[1:52:44] little higher to see into the back part
[1:52:46] of God's mind and see this this whole
[1:52:48] Revelation unfold and now it says in the
[1:52:51] last part now I know that he desires I
[1:52:55] know I know because I know I was always
[1:52:58] part of him I was chose in him before
[1:53:00] the foundation of the world this mystery
[1:53:02] of why he chose me it's all erased
[1:53:04] because I look at my conduct I'm not
[1:53:06] worthy I look at my Heritage there's no
[1:53:08] good Heritage I look at why how could he
[1:53:11] choose me it's such a mystery amen but
[1:53:13] now the Revelation is taking us all the
[1:53:15] way back before the foundation the world
[1:53:17] and now I know that he desires I know
[1:53:19] why he chose me I was part of him always
[1:53:22] part of him and always destined to come
[1:53:24] to this place wasn't my Merit Merit
[1:53:27] wasn't my Heritage it wasn't my Good
[1:53:29] Conduct it was all because I was with
[1:53:33] him
[1:53:34] originally now he's placed me here to
[1:53:38] fulfill this end time part of the
[1:53:41] Revelation and now I want to surrender
[1:53:44] everything I have to surrender to that
[1:53:48] amen let's sing this song together
