Oh, as the song we just sang sings, Lord, even when we've strayed away, even when we were lost and blind and our minds were clouded and we were enemies in our minds, you come and found us, Lord. You found us like you found the woman at the well in Samaria. Lord, you had needs to go by, Lord. And for each one of us, there was a time you had needs to come by our way because you knew us from before the foundation of the world. You predestined. You loved us from before. And that love is never ending. Lord, it can never fade. It can never fail. God, even now, Lord, when we make our mistakes and when we fail you, you've never failed us. Well, we love you so much and we're so grateful that you've gathered us together again for the privilege of being here, Lord, with the saints, Lord, with your children like precious faith as we can come together to sing your praises. It's a joy. It's a thrill to our hearts to the privilege to lift our voice cuz rocks will not cry out in my place, Lord. But let me do the praising. Let me do the worshiping. Let me declare your glory, Lord. never want to rock the substitute what I have the privilege of doing today. Speak of your greatness. And God, as we come to the portion of this service where we look into your word, Lord, we can't do it without you, Lord. We've got to have the eyes sav. We have to have eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart to perceive. Lord, if you give us the spirit of knowledge and wisdom and revelation, Lord, and open to our understanding, to understand the scriptures, to see them, Lord, to have them revealed to us. Lord, we pray that you would open our ears and open our hearts. And Lord, that I pray you'd open my mouth and you would speak your eternal words through these lips of clay for we are utterly dependent upon you. Lord, be praised and be blessed in all that we say and do as you take your preeminence among us. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Isn't he good? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Thank you, musicians. I've got a couple of announcements I'd like to make right off and I always enjoy making. There's certain kind of announcements I really like making and some of you know some of my favorites. So, we got two of my favorites today. So, the first one is a baby announcement. As you most of you know, early Thursday morning, Brother Riley and Sister Abigail Sanders welcomed their little baby Mildred Rose Sanders came into the world and her name is Little Millie. Amen. I think that's a super cute name. They're going to call her Millie. So, we just want to thank God for a safe delivery of this baby. And I know the nurseries are full and Sunday school classes are filling up, but that's a good problem to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a good problem to have. Amen. So, thank God for them and we're happy for them and they're doing really well. And I also have an engagement to announce. That's another one of my favorite announcements. And so, uh, if we could bring up the picture there, Sister Mida Bondo is engaged to be married to a to a brother in the Congo, Brother Colombo. So, we're very very happy for Sister Me and the Bondo family. Want to congratulate him. Amen. Amen. They haven't set the date of the wedding yet, but they've uh they're they're official. Amen. And uh she's got to finish some of her documentation here for permanent residency. So, but she's going to go to Congo to be married and to live there, but she wants to get her documentation done here. So, it's easy to come back and forth, and they have options in the future. So, just pray that all of that goes smooth for them because I'm sure they don't want to wait forever to get married now that they're engaged. So, we'll just pray for them. Amen. I also want to remind you of the um uh the Labor Day picnic tomorrow at brother Benjamin and Sister Manda Seabolt. So, we appreciate them always being so gracious to uh lend us their property, invite everybody over, and so we look forward to seeing you all there. And and I thank God for the weather. Amen. It's looking really, really spectacular. Amen. Also wanted to let you know and remind you, you heard it in the prayer request, but our brother Wesley will be getting married next weekend. So we're very very happy for him, for sister Anne. Their wedding will be in Connecticut. So my wife and I will be traveling out there to be part of that to enjoy that time with them. And so there won't be any afternoon communion service next Sunday even though it's the first service of the month. And also brother Danny Delmundo from the Philippines will be here preaching. So just keep him in prayer and we look forward to that. It's bittersweet for me because I will miss him entirely. He comes and I miss him on the coming and I miss him on the going. So, that's a little bittersweet, but I'm glad he'll be here to minister. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand together and take our Bibles. As you stand, I just want to welcome a few visitors. First, I want to make an official welcome to the Fielding family that's moved here from Arizona. Amen. They're all together. We just want to greet you and say, "God bless you." We got to meet Sister Jacqueline a few weeks ago. She came with the four younger children, but Matthew had to stay back and finish things. and he came while I was gone and and then he they weren't able to make it Wednesday when I was here. So now we're all here together. So this is official welcome. So God bless you. I want you to feel very welcomed and at home. Also, Brother Randy and Sister Anna Lungsford are visiting with us again. So God bless you. It's always good to have you. And um and also I saw Rebecca Holapo has her sister and her family here. So God bless you. It's good to have you here from Edmonton. So we got a lot of visitors. Amen. And uh we got a special visitors from Missouri. Uh brother Brandon and Sister Charity Wood come from Missouri. Amen. They're new believers who just heard the message and they've been streaming. They want to come and visit us. So it's good to have you. God bless you and you're very welcome. And any other visitors, if you're here, we just want you to feel very welcome at home. And we thank God for the opportunity to worship together. Amen. It's a precious privilege for all of us. Amen. And while we're standing, if you could turn your Bibles to Genesis chapter 1. This is the scripture we've been opening with for the last uh this will be the fifth service as we take the same topic, a message from the Holy Spirit from the pick up your pen and write portion of the message. And so we're going to start here at the same scripture, Genesis 1 verse 11. Genesis 1 11. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth." And it was so. And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its kind. And the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind. And God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. May God bless you as you're seated. Uh, I keep repeating myself, but and I do it intentionally, but it it's just so good to keep this message in context as brother Bam's coming to spoken word is the original seed. This is his opening scripture because he's going to show us the principle that the spoken word is the original seed &gt;&gt; and it's it's quite a principle in the scripture. So, we're going to look at that just for a minute as we move on. I I have intentions of finishing this uh to the end today and and I say the word intentions. So some of it Hey, listen. Some of it depends on you, &gt;&gt; you know. So don't I can't be blamed for all of it. Amen. We share in this together, but if you'll just keep pulling and we just want God to have his way and tell us what he wants to tell us. Amen. We're going through, we're not breaking down every word. We're not playing out everything, but as we feel inspired to highlight something, to draw on it, we're just going that way, going through it slowly. And I've been thoroughly enjoying it myself has been something that's been very special for me. Uh, and I hope it is for you as well. But let's just let's just work together. Amen. To rightly divide the word of God. It takes teamwork here. You pull, I'll surrender, and we'll let God speak. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, as we take a look at this, uh, quote now, he says, "Remember, every spoken word of God is the original seed." So, the original seed is when God's thought, amen, becomes word. When he expresses his thought, now that's the original seed. And that thought has to fully materialize. Amen. And, and if it's not hybrid, it will always stay with the original thought. Amen. So now remember, every spoken word of God is the original seed. God planted everything in the earth by his word. And as long as you stay with the original seed, it will breed itself right back and reproduce itself again. Hybrid it, it dies. So brother Bam is laying this principle down and spoken words, the original seed to try to show us we've got to come back to the original word of God. And the original word of God will always produce the same thing. Amen. It'll always produce the life of God because the word is God. It's his thought expressed. So it every word, Amen, is a thought expressed. And that's why brother Bram said, "And the word is God." Because God, God is the collection of his thoughts he had about himself. God is his thoughts. Amen. What he thought, what he's thinking on. Amen. Before uh he had form that we understand, he was the invisible God before space and time and matter. Before all of that, he was he was brother V. He was alone with his thoughts. He was the consummation of his thoughts. He was the collection of his thoughts. And now whenever those thoughts become a word, that's him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the word and the word is him. Amen. And God has been trying to express what's been in his mind and he's expressed through word and the word comes into manifestation and it's expressing God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you can't hybrid it. Because if you hybrid it, then it begins to die. It's got to stay original to that thought that he had. That's why I thank God that the spoken word is the original seed and God through a pro prophetic ministry has brought back the original word so that we can have life. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says here again, all of God's sons must be the same. Yes, sir. To be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3. See, to be born of the water and the spirit, what does it do? Then it brings you right back again to the place of where you should have been at the beginning. He's talking about the fall in the Garden of Eden because God's original intention was for him to bring forth himself in a family attributes in flesh upon the earth fellowshipping together on his creation. That was his original thought. That was his original plan. That's what he wanted to accomplish. And sin disrupted that. And there was a a perversion, a hybriding, and began to bring death. But the cycle of redemption is to redeem back to that thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Back to that purpose. And that's what God's been doing through the entire Bible. That's why the whole Bible is a book of redemption. It's a story. God shows you the masterpiece from the beginning. This is the masterpiece of the thought of the artist. What he envisioned in his mind. What he wanted to reproduce and he reproduced it and he placed it in the Garden of Eden. And then an enemy came in and marred the masterpiece and it fell over. But he didn't leave it there in ruin. He started working again. It took 6,000 years to get to the masterpiece. Now he's been working 6,000 years to bring back his original thought, his original word with the original intention is to what? To God to reproduce himself as a family in flesh upon this earth. &gt;&gt; And that's why we had to be restored to the word to come back to that purpose. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we would have been born in the beginning correctly, we would have been an attribute of God now expressed upon the earth. God expressing himself as his family in perfection. Amen. But it was marred. But now to be born of the water and the spirit, what does it do then? It brings you right back again into the place where you should have been at the beginning. Amen. It brings you, what's he say? See, that's the reason of Christ's death. It brings us right back again to where? Sons of God. What what does he want us to be? Sons of God. What would we have been been if we would have been born correctly? Sons of God. What happens now through the spiritual new birth? That's why we must be born again because we were born wrong in the flesh. We have to be born again. And born again to what? Back to sons of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If Eve would have brought forth that child, she would have finally done it. Did not God tell her multiply and replenish the earth? He says, "What happened? Eve hybrid it bred it what it did then what did it do turn to death just keep dying dying now this one come and that out now here stays the word just the same here's the word laying here just the same now what happened here is the word now the word that God spoke to multiply and replenish the earth it couldn't find a place to land finally this word caught into the womb of a virgin &gt;&gt; oh this is so good friends he's he's want what does he wanted to bring forth son. Adam was a son of God and he was supposed to reproduce himself to reproduce another son of God. Amen. A Christ upon the earth. Amen. But that got marred. And so God said, "Multiply and replenish." And now they went about it the wrong way by reasoning and hybrid. And now it could no longer reproduce the original thought and the original form. So that word, Mother Beam said, that word that God spoke, it's got to find a resting place cuz that word can't die. Amen. So that resting place was in the womb of a virgin. And now in the womb of the virgin, that prophecy, that word, that spoken word of God, that's the original seed. Amen. Took root in that womb and reproduced what? The word. &gt;&gt; What's the word? The thought of God expressed. What was his thought? Amen. To become flesh upon the earth. And he did that in Jesus Christ. That's why brother Benham said, "When I see when I see this, I see denominations and all things just fading away and everything fades away. There's only that one thing and that's Jesus Christ. He's the only thing. What is Jesus Christ? He is the fullness of God. His full thought and desire now manifest upon the earth. And what is that? It's God wants to be flesh upon the earth to fellowship with his children. &gt;&gt; That's why everything fades away and everything wraps up in that one person, Jesus Christ, which is amen. The spoken word materialized, the thought of God made manifest. God reproduced upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; amen. And and Adam was supposed to do that, but it failed. But that word can't fail. It can never stop. It's got to keep circling the earth, waiting to come to manifestation. And it came to manifestation in perfect time when that word dropped into the womb of a virgin. And now because of his death, burial, and resurrection, and the shedding of his blood, and the price of redemption, his spirit is available to bring us spiritual new birth. Amen. Now, we don't have to to succumb to the hybrid condition anymore. But he's providing his own spirit to give us power to manifest his word in every day and age that we're living in by the spirit that he poured out. Because that spirit could come upon man, that spirit could anoint man. But until he had a sanctifying power of his blood to separate us from sin, that spirit could not live in man. &gt;&gt; But now he's brought back the spoken word &gt;&gt; to bring back sons and daughters of God, moving us all the way back in redemption to the place where we come back to a perfect body. No more hybridization to a restored earth. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad for this message. He says when God give a commission which cannot perish. He's talking about multiply and replenish. When God give a commission which cannot perish. God's word is eternal. It cannot fail. When he said multiply and replenish earth, that was God's eternal purpose to carry that out. You cannot die &gt;&gt; because the original word is life. Amen. But when you hybrid it, it brings death because it's his word. You have to live. If that child had been brought forth, right, there would have been no death. But she couldn't wait. So the whole lesson for us is to stay with the original word &gt;&gt; to wait and let him produce. Don't hybrid. Don't add reasoning. Don't change anything. This what brother's trying to show us that he's brought back the word, the original, the foundation of the church back to the teaching of the apostles and prophets, back to hearts turned back to the uh uh to the fathers, the apostolic fathers. And he's telling us to stay with this word because this word cannot bring death. It can only bring life. But if you hybridize it, which is what denominationalism did, he said it will only bring death and can't reproduce itself again. So that word, that commission has to find a resting place to reproduce the sons and daughters of God on earth again. And I want my soul to be that resting place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thanks be to God Almighty. If you take your little booklet that we've been looking through, if you didn't get a booklet, there's some by the back door. The deacons have them. There's some in the forer as well. You can run and grab one or wave your hand. They'll bring it to you or whatever. We'll we'll we'll serve you. &gt;&gt; We'll bring it to you. But let's go to the page one and read right from the beginning here. says, "One night as I was seeking the Lord, the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write. As I grasped the pen to write, his spirit gave me a message for the church. I want to bring it to you. It has to do with the word and the bride." Here is what I'm trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11. It's such a simple thought, but the original word will bring forth the word. &gt;&gt; We come back to the original doctrine, the original teaching, the original thought of God, the original word, it'll reproduce the word. It can't produce anything else. But if you hybrid that word and keep sewing a hybrid seed, it will only reproduce what it is, is a hybrid seed. It can never come back to pure life. And so the by God's grace, he's brought us back to the original word. And that original word, Amen, will only bring forth after its kind. So what do I what what do I want to do? I want to stay with nothing but the original word that was delivered through a prophetic office in the end time, the restoration of truth. That's all I want because that's what produces life. &gt;&gt; I don't want to get smarter. I don't want to figure it out. I don't want to sort it. I just want to receive it. I want to believe it. I want to manifest. I want to surrender to it and I want him to do what he promised he would do with that original word in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now let's jump from here over to where we are now on page seven. We'll go from where we've been studying and continue on. And there's several points we're going to get and highlight several different things. So, it's not going to be all one subject, but we'll just go uh as as we can. Um, let me jump over here. Okay, we'll get to this in a second, but let's read at the bottom of page 7, paragraph 175-1. The strange behavior of Moses, Elijah, and John withdrawing from the people into seclusion left many confused. They did not realize that it was because their message had been rejected. But the seed had been swn. The planting was over. Judgment was next. They had served their purpose as a sign to the people. So judgment was next. Now let's go to the top of page 8. He says, "I believe according to Revelation 13:16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or the forehead if permission to preach be granted. denominations will take the mark or be forced to quit preaching. Then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great harlot. So I want to go, let's turn together to Revelation 13. And I want to give some background to this because this is just a quick statement that says that I believe that the bride will uh have to stop preaching because of the beast. So I want to look at this again and understand the context of this and where this is coming from. So let's look at Revelations 13 verse 1. And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the name name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. Amen. Brother teaches us all these things and break it down. We're not going to go in great detail today, but he shows us that this is the old Babylonian system that is a that is the gentile world powers now all rolled up into Romanism and and has moved from pagan Rome to papal Rome and become a church with political and spiritual influence united together. And he's showing us the dragon which is Satan himself has given an anointing and a seat to this beast. This this beast is a power and it's a power of politics united with religion. And and so he's showing the compilation of the animals is these uh is these uh four gentile world powers starting from Babylon to the Mes and the Persians to the Greeks and finally to the Rome and Rome and the feet of the image. Remember the image of Daniel. It went out into the toes. That was the end. That was the last world power, the gentile world power that would dominate the world until the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and struck in the feet and destroyed the whole system. Right? So now they're showing us that this beast is a compilation of all of it before. The leopard, the bear, the lion, all rolled into one because what was Babylon moved into meat in Persia, moved into Greece, moved into Rome, and all of it collected together in the Roman Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed, and all the world wondered after the beast." This is when Rome was falling. It was collapsing. It was it was doomed. Amen. But the cath the Catholic Church had risen to power and now and risen to power and wealth. And when pagan Rome was falling, Amen. the the pope bought out the enemy who was coming to attack them and brought peace and saved Rome. And by doing so, they became the power over Rome. And that whole system moved into the Catholic Church. And that's why it went from the Roman Empire to the Holy Roman Empire because now it was a church in politics united and the king or emperor of the whole empire was the pope. &gt;&gt; So that this is all history. This is all world history. And it's showing all of this that deadly wound was healed. And they worshiped the dragon and gave power unto the beast. And they worshiped the beast saying, "Who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him?" And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and two months. That's three and a half years. That'll be the tribulation period. And he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blasphe his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations. and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. So that is the that is the the beast system. That's the original uh uh uh beast system there. The gentile world powers blended into a religious power and and unified. But now we're going to get to another beast. So I want to look at these beasts in the book of uh uh Revelation 13. Now let's go to verse 11. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth. And he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exercised all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth, and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he does great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of these miracles, which he had power to do in the sight of the beast, saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by the sword, and did live. And he gave power and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. So brother Ram comes now he's explaining all of this and he comes to this portion of scripture and if I could I'll take a quote here out of the mark of the beast. He says uh and this is from 1954 said I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth not out of water because that first beast rose up out of the populated part of the earth but this beast is America and it's coming out of the land where very few people were say it's coming out of the earth then the thickness and multitudes of people is water then this is where there was no people the United States and he had two horns like a lamb remember Bible says like a lamb and brother says two horns like a lamb not a lamb What is it? It's our American buffalo. &gt;&gt; Which which President Obama designated as a national symbol now &gt;&gt; just a few years ago. The buffalo. Amen. And so uh see sure there he is two horns like a lamb. But then what did he do? He had freedom of religion. First he acted like a lamb. He spoke like a lamb. But remember he never did become an old ram. He was a lamb. The country is only 150 years old. You know just a lamb. And then he spake like a dragon, and he exercised all the power the first beast had before him, the red dragon, and caused all that was on the earth that dwelleth upon the earth, to worship the beast whose deadly wound was healed. Look, and he does great wonders so to make him a fire come down out of heaven. Brother says, the atomic bomb and hydrogen, smart, intelligent nation and so forth, deceiving the nations by these things. This is important because uh that that Roman system began to diminish in its political power but it never diminishes a religion. It was always working behind the scenes. Now America comes up as freedom of a religion trying to get away from the control of organized religion. Amen. But we saw through the things that we've been studying through the election of a of a Catholic uh h a Catholic president how that Catholic system wormed its way back in. Brother said wait till it gets wormed in the cabinet and all of that. And it's here, friends. &gt;&gt; And the members of Congress, the the the the majority of the members of the uh uh US Supreme Court, all Catholic, Catholic, Catholic, our vice president, Catholic. It's a it's it's all wormed its way into the government. It's done exactly what he said done. And it started off like a lamb and innocence and spoke like a dragon said like a lamb. But it was just a an American buffalo. That's the image that Brother Bam tied it to. Amen. But then it had freedom of religion, but he said that thing had two horns. One was ecclesiastical and one was political. And and it's starting to unite the two. And we're watching it happen in politics right now. Anding uniting the religion and the political world together, which is exactly what the first beast did. Tied politics and religion together to rule. &gt;&gt; And that's what America is doing. And brother Bam said, doing it through the World Council of Churches, trying to bring a system that unites everybody and brings it together. And it'll eventually be headed up by the pope. Though they never intended it to be that way. That's what the prophet told us. And what power is bringing this to pass? It's this new beast that's come up out of the earth. It's America. And America rose to prominence in World War II. Amen. And America did miracles inside of all the people and deceive the nation. And what was the miracles? They brought fire down from heaven upon the earth in the sight of all men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That was the miracle. And brother Bam said, "That's the atomic bomb, hydrogen." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so I started looking at that because it's so interesting. It ties in, listen, it ties in with the bride not being able to preach because they're going to move into this political religious unification. Amen. And if you don't unify with it, if you don't come into terms with it, like we won't come into terms with any system, amen, anything that degrades the word of God one iota and forces us, amen, to let down the bar on one word, we won't be able to be part of that system because how can two walk together unless they be agreed? But immediately you're going to be shut on the outside and you won't be able to preach. And brother Bam said, "Amen. They'll lock the doors to the church." And he has so many things that he says about that. &gt;&gt; But I started looking at this America and her place and her role in prophecy. And now in World War II and and uh once again about two years ago, I think it was, I was at the Air Force Museum. I mean, there's revelations all over the Air Force Museum. Friends, &gt;&gt; you should go. In fact, every museum I go to, all I can see is the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Almost all the modern world events that have major significance, two world wars, um the the the the mass production of the automobile, the plane, the spacecraft, launching a man into orbit, it all happened in the lifetime of a prophet so he could preach the message countdown and show us that we've went from horse and buggy to automobile. And in his lifetime, he remembers the horse and buggy, the automobile, the plane, and then the spaceship launching a man breaking gravitational hold and bringing him outside the hold of the world. Amen. All of that happened in the lifetime of one human being in 56 years. Look at how remarkable that is. &gt;&gt; So every museum to me is the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; I don't just go in there and say, "Well, this happened, this is what the prophet talked about. This is what he said. This is prophecy. This is this is Revelation 13. So it becomes so much fun. &gt;&gt; And so I was at the Air Force Museum and they've got an airplane. I think it's a B29 bomber. I may get the numbers wrong. Forgive me for you aircraft fanatics. I get the nomenclature all twisted. But a big bomber. It's called Boxcar. Boxcar is the plane that dropped the second atomic bomb dropped on a Nagasaki. There was another plane that dropped the first one on Hiroshima. And the dropping of those two bombs are what ended the war. And it was the first time nuclear weapons were used in warfare. But I'll put a disclaimer, the first time in modern history. &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Brandham said it was an atomic bomb that knocked the earth off its asses and caused the flood in the beginning. &gt;&gt; There was an atomic power way back there. &gt;&gt; So they say the first time ever. I say the first time in modern history. &gt;&gt; Amen. first time that they know of. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; So, so I looked at this. Let's look at this scripture together. Verse 13. Brother Bam said, uh, America is the number 13. It started with 13 colonies, 13 states, 13 stripes. The number 13. It shows up in Revelation chapter 13. Now look at chapter 13:13. and he does great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. This is what astonished me when I was in that uh museum is that I was reading on the bomb and reading on the bombings and I had always just assumed I don't know where I got the assumption but it was through ignorance but assumed that the atomic bomb fell out of the plane and came all the way to the ground and when it struck the ground it detonated and exploded. But while I'm standing there looking in that plaque, all of a sudden it said that that bomb fell for 40ome seconds and when it got to approximately 2,000 ft off the ground, it detonated and exploded. &gt;&gt; What that was so significant for me is he will cause fire to fall down from heaven &gt;&gt; to the earth. And that is exactly what that atomic bomb did when America dropped it. They they caused literally they caused fire to fall from the heaven 2,000 ft in the air. It detonated, exploded. It created the heat, the same heat 1,800,000 degree Fahrenheit that you find in the core of the sun. Man made his own miniature sun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Think about this. Man is always trying to do what God's doing because God made the sun through nuclear fusion. And they made through nuclear fusion another sun. Amen. And it was blinding light. &gt;&gt; You mean man uses a blinding light to destroy? Absolutely. It starts with a blinding light with the intensity of the sun and then the heat rays, the fire falls down from there upon the earth. When those heat rays hit the earth in the epicenter, the core where it fell, it was 7,232 degrees. This this beast out of the earth literally made fire come down from heaven upon the earth exactly the way the Bible said it would. &gt;&gt; And we had a prophet in our day to say this is that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And when you go to learn more about that, the more you learn about that, the more you realize this is that &gt;&gt; and that is this. And the prophet was exactly right and knew exactly what he was looking at and it matched the Bible word for word and perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because he did that in the sight of all, he deceived the whole world. This is when America rose to prominence and world power. Before that, they were not. the European nations were. But America rose to power because of their influence in World War II and because they they were able to have such technology, technological advances and defeat the enemy. And they ended the war with the with nuclear bombs. &gt;&gt; And it immediately catapulted America to the world power, to the supreme world power. It even changed the money system. Now, now gold the the the standard was going to be the US dollar. Everything changed. The whole system now revolved around the United States because of the miracles they could do in the sight of all men. &gt;&gt; Exactly what God said thousands of years before. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God. We have a sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I remembered reading that when I got to this part, I started uh I just say that's not all, friends. &gt;&gt; So, I just look at it because these things fascinate me. You know how brother Bam said, "God makes man testify." &gt;&gt; He makes man testify of it. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; The the serpent on the pole and every ambulance, he makes him testify of divine healing. &gt;&gt; So, I started researching this to make sure I had my figures right, that it was in the air and fire come down and all the things that happened. And while I was uh I was watching a science clip on that and and they started talking about when they were developing the bomb and there was a scientist a nuclear physicist by the name of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Iimer was the head of the program to develop the nuclear bomb and they wanted to detonate one to see if it would work. They were building it. They had the concept, but many scientists were afraid to detonate a nuclear bomb because they were afraid that it would start a chain reaction in the atmosphere and explode the entire atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Praise God, that's going to happen someday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're not far from the truth. &gt;&gt; They were afraid. And so they kept doing calculations and they finally the the way the science video said, they said they found by calculations it was highly unlikely that would happen. To me, that's not 100%. You know, that's highly unlikely. And they decided to go ahead and try it. Can you imagine? I There's about a 95% chance that won't happen. We won't destroy the entire planet and kill everybody on it. You want to go for it? Yeah. 95% is pretty good, man. Is ridiculous, friends. So, anyways, they decide to go ahead with it. So, they're going to they're going to have this secret. They have a secret test. They're going to they're going to uh detonate a nuclear bomb, an atomic bomb for the first time. I think it was a plutonium bomb. And so Oenheimimer names came this explosion, this test, because they had code names for everything. &gt;&gt; Do you know what the code name for this first time man in modern history is going to explode a nuclear bomb? &gt;&gt; Trinity. He cames it Trinity. &gt;&gt; It was the Trinity test. And you can still go to New Mexico. There's two times a year that you can get on the site where they detonated in April and October. And it's called the Trinity site. And it was the Trinity test. And it's code name Trinity. And man was now going to unleash the most powerful destructive force that man has come up with in modern times. The most destructive force that he can come up with with modern science, with his reasoning, with his intelligence, with his science. The most destructive thing was this nuclear bomb. And he named it Trinity because Trinity was the most destructive doctrine that man came up with with his reasoning. &gt;&gt; God makes them testify of it. And then that Trinity doctrine becomes the litmus test whether you're a Christian or not. Because if you want to re believe the true doctrine of the Godhead, now you're not a Christian. You believe something false because it's widely accepted. We all believe Trinity. What do you think is going to be one of the bases for this world system? Listen, if you're a Christian church, these are the fundamental beliefs. But I don't believe in a in a trinity. I believe in a trinity of offices, not a trinity of persons. I believe in one God and the Godhead. And that God desired to be a family. And what's so insidious and destructive about the trinity doctrine is it changes the very nature of God. And you change the very nature of God, you change the very plan of God. Because God's plan was for one God, one Godhead to become a family. And if you split him up into three people and you lock it in there, then you've cut me out of the program and you've cut you out of the program and all the sons of God are cut out of the program. And that's an insidious, destructive force that has hit the spiritual world. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; My goodness, if God is not perfect, friends, &gt;&gt; this message is perfect. And brother Bam knew exactly what he was talking about and he points to that. And the deeper you go, the more astounding it gets and the more amazing it gets. And what what possessed that man oppenheimer? Amen. To call to call that test trinity. &gt;&gt; My God's forcing him to declare with his own mouth &gt;&gt; the destructive force of man spiritually and naturally. &gt;&gt; And this is what brought America to prominence. And American prominence is going to tie the whole world back to the original worship of the B system, the Roman system. bringing back the Roman system with a unification of religion and politics. &gt;&gt; And then they become the world policing force and the great power of the world so that they can force anybody who will not go along with this will now suffer the consequences and the wrath of the great powerful &gt;&gt; beast that was like a lamb. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My friends, &gt;&gt; don't you love serving God? &gt;&gt; Amen. If he knew all of this from all the way back and he let everything happen according to his perfect plan and it had to happen while a prophet was here and a prophet had to declare it and see it and all of these things have to testify themselves. Amen. What am I worried about in my dayto-day life? He's watched over everything and everything's perfect and it'll all work out perfect and he's allowed everything to come to the way it's coming. And if if the bride is forced to stop preaching, then praise God, it's already prophesied. Then God will allow all circumstance to come together to bring that result because that's prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They have give a boycott. They have to buy or sell. Let's let's continue reading. Let's look here at verse 16. And he causes all both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads. and that no man might by or sell save he that hath the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number 6003 score and six. Amen. And brother Bam takes that number and attaches it to the Roman numerals that's in the title of the pope vicarious fili day. Amen. And he becomes a vicer of Christ in the place of Christ sitting in the seat of God. all the prophecies that say that at some point Satan will be incarnate in this man and he'll become the beast. &gt;&gt; All these things will happen. Brother's telling us right here and pick up your pen and write anointed of the spirit. I believe according to Revelation 13:16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead if permission to preach be granted. &gt;&gt; He said it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; So if it happens, praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I uh let's go with me to Ephesians. Yeah, this is my next slide. Let's go to Ephesians chapter 4. I just want to sew this in while we're here. Ephesians chapter 4. When Jesus ascended on high, he gave gifts unto men. And we pick it up in Ephesians 4:11. It says, "And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God and to a perfect man, stature of a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie and wait to deceive. But speaking the truth in love, may grow up unto him in all things which is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part, making increase of the body and to the edifying of itself in love. So what is the point of preaching? because the bride will be forced to stop preaching because she won't take the mark. And when brother Benham comes to the mark of the beast, I'll just read it here. He says, "Now remember, I think this is right." Yeah. Imperial pagan Rome that fell by the sword. But she was healed of her death stroke when she joined to the nominal Christian church of Rome and incorporated paganism and Christianity and thereby became the Holy Roman Empire which was to endure until Jesus came and destroyed her. But Rome is not going it alone. Her daughters are right there with her. And she will take over absolute authority by the World Council of Churches. This may seem far-fetched, but to some, but actually is very plain for all to see. Because right now, the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great is that control. This ecumenical move will end up with Rome at the head even though the people did not envision it that way. This is because in Revelation 17:3-6 it states that the mystery Babylon is seated on the beast. She is controlling the last or fourth empire. This Roman church is doing that with the world church systems under her. Rome will be controlling and this image church system will be obedient to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world. Thus all the people have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or the head. This mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the world church systems which is trinitarianism etc. Yeah. Trinity the destructive force and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the church. So so unless you receive the mark in the hand or the mark in the head you cannot buy and sell. There's a boycott. There's a shutting down. They're no longer allowed to participate. But brother Bam says the mark in the head means they have taken the doctrine. I'm going to highlight it for you because I can do that now. The mark in the head means to take the doctrine of the world church systems with the trinity etc. So that's the mark in the head to agree with to accept to go along with the teaching and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the church. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you obey, you submit, you pay in, you you you agree with, you collaborate with th with this great power, the church system will persecute the true bride. This image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc. Her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it. But before the antichrist in person takes over his complete world system of churches, the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord. God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now this this bride who's had her eyes open, who's been illuminated by the truth. She knows the death of the s uh of the system. She knows the death of reasoning on the word. She knows the death of perverting and hybriding the word and not staying with the original spoken word. She'll never go into this system. And if she doesn't go into this system, they will prevent her from preaching and teaching. They will shut her down, lock the churches, do all the things brother Benham said. But I say, praise God. What's the purpose of preaching? We go back to Ephesians. And when we go back to Ephesians chapter 4, the purpose of preaching is for the perfecting of the saints, &gt;&gt; for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son of God and to a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the till we all come into the full stature of a perfect man &gt;&gt; and reflect Christ. That we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro. So that we no more are misled by false teaching. Carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slight of men, cunning crabies whereby they lie and wait to deceive. And speaking the truth of love, we grow up into all things and to him which is the head. And then the whole body is contributing equally their portion to the edification of the whole body. That's the point of preaching. The point of preaching is for our perfection, which is full maturity, to come into the stature of the fullness of of Christ. Amen. To to reflect the life of Christ, to grow into the head in all things. Amen. to be a joint that supplies. And so when God shuts the doors on the church and stops the preaching, it means the preaching has met its objective. The bride is now mature. &gt;&gt; Don't cry when they lock the doors. When they stop the preaching, I will be in retirement. Amen. I'll no longer be preaching the gospel because the preaching will have accomplished its objective. The bride is now ready to make her final stand where every member has the word. Every member's grown into the character of Christ. And she won't back down. She's predestinated not to. Every mother, every child, every boy and girl, older person, elderly, widow, married, they're going to make that stand and say, "I won't compromise on the word for nothing." And they won't need a preacher to hold their hand to do it because they've grown into the stature of the fullness of Christ, the full reflection of the word on this earth in bride form. &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to the day they stop the preaching. &gt;&gt; That's why we're preaching. We're not we're not disturbed by that idea. We're blessed by that idea because God's not going to let us stop until it's accomplished a purpose. When it's accomplishes a purpose, God will let us stop because now he wants to show himself in her. &gt;&gt; That's why we come Sunday and Wednesday. That's why we're here to grow into this so that God can allow that system to bar the doors and shut the preacher's mouth and stop it because now he's saying you don't need that anymore. You've come to the place I wanted to get you. Amen. Because brother Brandham said at that end time he's going to take that little bride, lift her up here and say this was her and then away he goes with her. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to try to interpret that and tell you I know exactly what it means. But it shows to me it's a two-stage process. He's going to lift her up and show her off to the world. this is her and then he goes away with it. &gt;&gt; If you can't come to church, you just got to realize you are the church. You are Christ. The word is in you. You don't need to go hear the word. You've become the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In fullness. It's come to its pinnacle. It's come to the peak. It's come to the point of the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything Brother Brandon preached, everything we keep rehearsing, everything we're coming here for is for this glorious purpose that this bride will be him standing upon the earth. The fullness of that word made flesh again on this earth just like it was 2,000 years ago. Now it's not in a singular body. Now it's in a many membered bride body, but it's the same life with the same manifestation with the same obedience to the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Don't ever read those quotes again and shake. Don't ever read those quotes again and mourn. Don't ever read those quotes again because that's going to be our graduation day. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise be unto God. &gt;&gt; And to me, this answers the question because so many people struggle with if the Lord has come, if Christ is here, why do we still have a five-fold ministry? The perfect word has been delivered. And so maybe I should just listen to the tapes and maybe I shouldn't live a fifthful ministry because they're men. They make mistakes and and that's absolutely 100% the truth and they'll all get it wrong which is absolutely 100% the truth. But that's how God builds our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. But for me, some people have stopped taking communion because Paul says, "We do this and show his death till he has come." And we know the Lord has come. &gt;&gt; But we also know the Lord is coming. &gt;&gt; He's got to come and establish his throne upon the earth during the millennium. &gt;&gt; And the question is, who what right do we have to do to determine which coming he was referring to? Right. &gt;&gt; The last message brother Brandham preached in was communion message. One of the last things he did in church was take communion with the saints before his death. &gt;&gt; What right do we have to know more than the prophet or figure out more than him? He was there telling people to preach. He was telling them come to church. Come and listen to brother Perry. That was some of the last things he was telling. We have a great church now to come together and bring our children. When did we get so smart that we could outsmart God and outsmart God's prophet and say, "Well, he didn't really mean that. I'm supposed to catch the secret revelation. I don't need fivefold ministry and I don't need to take communion. No, friends. When God is done with that, he'll be done with that. God interprets his word by bringing it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he'll do it by this system shutting down the preaching and teaching and the churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until then, let's do what the prophet told us to do. Let's do what the Bible tells us to do. Let's proclaim it. Let's preach it. Let's gather together. Let's assemble together and not forsake the assembling together of ourselves. Let's stay with every word and we're going to keep doing every word because I'm not going to use my reasoning and my deduction and my interpretation of the message to decide no, we don't no longer need this, we don't no longer need that. I'm going to keep doing what the word says until he bars the doors, till he shuts it down. And when he stops it and I'm arrested and I'm sitting in prison and you all are scattered everywhere, I'll say, "Praise God, he accomplished his goal. &gt;&gt; The sermons were worth something. They meant it. the sacrifices, all the work to have a church, all the labor that goes into keeping a building and coming together and having an audio system and preaching an internet, it finally accomplished what it was supposed to accomplish. &gt;&gt; If you hear of me winding up in prison because I won't stop. &gt;&gt; Don't mourn for me. I'll be the happiest man on the earth because all that I gave my life for meant something at that point. &gt;&gt; What Brother Bam gave his life for was accomplished. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. What looks like the worst of times is always the best of times. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just a test of whether we believe the prophecy or not. &gt;&gt; And I said, "God, help me to believe this prophecy." Oh, friends, it just seems like you want to preach everything. Just keep going. Keep going. Everything's become so alive. Do you feel that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Every word the prophet said, every prophecy, every message, it's becoming so alive, so tangible, so real, such a force inside of me that wants to be expressed. And I don't even know how. I don't even know what. I don't even know how. I don't even know how to verbalize what's going on. I don't even know how to put it in action. But some little spring way down the inside is pushing me. Amen. It's bubbling up of its own accord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for it. Amen. Let's see if we can read a little further. Let's go back to our little booklet here on page 8. Amen. Says paragraph 153-3. Now remember that Moses was born for a certain work. But he could not do that work until he'd received the gifts which would enable him to do the work. He had to go out in the desert and wait there. God had an appointed time. There was to be a certain pharaoh on the throne and the people had to be crying for bread of life before God could send him back. This is true for our day. Before brother Brandham could move into the latter reign ministry, the third pull, the opening of the seals, there had to be a certain pharaoh on the throne. &gt;&gt; Had to come to that sign of a Catholic uh uh president and and and brother Brandham, you know, brother Brandham is so gracious and so human &gt;&gt; that he never speaks bad of John F. Kenny because it has nothing to do with John F. Kennedy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't know him. He's a good man. He'll probably make a good president and probably do a good job." &gt;&gt; Brother Bam had no beef against the man. It wasn't the man. Nothing wrong with the man. Brother Bam thought he was a good man. It was the system that Jezebel system he was attached to. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam saw his symbolism. Even after JFK was assassinated, Brother Bam said the kindest things. Yeah. &gt;&gt; had the congregation stand and pray prayed for him and pray for his wife and said, "No matter if I disagree with a man or not, nobody deserves to be gunned down like that." And the poor wife and those poor little children. He was a human being with compassion and love. It wasn't the person. He was looking at the spiritual application. &gt;&gt; And so there had to be a certain pharaoh on the throne before. That's why brother Bam is preaching this message, spoken words seed. That's why he's struggling with what to come next because he's in the holding pattern. He has brought back, amen, the original faith of the original fathers. Amen. He's tied together the loose ends and brought us back to the foundational teachings of the apostles. And now they need to go into the next step, but he can't go. And he's in this holding period and the revival's dying back and he doesn't know what's going to happen next. And meetings are getting cancelled and he's not getting the calls he used to get. And even later on, God will tell him not to travel overseas and and to stay home and and store up the food to make the tapes. And all of this is happening and he's struggling with this and and and now all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord is telling him, "Listen, hey, hey, Moses had to wait for a certain Pharaoh." Amen. John the Baptist had to wait for a certain time. Amen. And you're waiting for a certain Pharaoh to rise on the throne and the appointed time you'll come forth. Lord, &gt;&gt; then let's keep going. But what do we have in this our day? Multitudes are working signs until we have a generation of sign seekers that know little or nothing about the word or a true move of the spirit of God. I I want to talk about this just for a minute. Brother Benam is here. He's in the the the the uh the hangover of the of the Pentecostal revival and the beginning of the charismatic movement is all taking place around him. And he's beginning to see that what started off true was now moving. And it was moving after signs, but not moving after the word. And remember, this message comes, this message from the spirit of of the Lord comes at a time he's preaching spoken word is the original seed. So, it's all about getting back to the original seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The original word. And so now in this by the anointing of the spirit he's writing uh they know little or they're sign seekers that know little or nothing about the word or a true move of the spirit of God. If they see blood, oil, fire, they are happy. It matters not what the what the it matters not what is in the word. They will support any sign even unscriptural ones. &gt;&gt; But God has warned us about that. He said in in Matthew 24 that in the last days the two spirits would be so close together that only the very elect would tell them apart for they alone would not be deceived. &gt;&gt; Can you underline that? &gt;&gt; They alone would not be deceived. &gt;&gt; Everyone else will be deceived but the predestinated the elect bride of Christ will not be deceived because he promised you wouldn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. in Deuteronomy, brother uh uh Moses here is is talking to Israel and he's giving them the word of the Lord. He's talking about prophets and signs and if it comes to pass, listen to him. But in Deuteronomy 13, he says this, "If there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, where whereof he spoken to thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them. Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams. For the Lord your God proveth you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the way back in the book of Deuteronomy, all the way back in the Exodus, Moses was warning them about this. Amen. If a prophet or a dreamer comes to comes to you with a sign or a wonder and what he says comes to pass. &gt;&gt; Now you understand that's the vindication of a prophet. Right. &gt;&gt; But he leads you to another god, to another teaching, to &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; We bring that home today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he leads you to another word, &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; another truth. Well, it says unto other gods, &gt;&gt; what is the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God. &gt;&gt; It's God expressed. It's the thought of God, which is God expressed to us. The word is God. Brother said, "God is the word." And if somebody else will compromise, hybrid, change that word and alter that word and bring another word, they've brought another God. &gt;&gt; And that's the fallacy of denominationalism. And that's that's what it's produced. But they have signs and wonders, friends. It's not a problem of working miracles. I grew up in a Pentecostal atmosphere. I saw miracles. I saw healings. I saw tongues and interpretation. I saw things that were true and things that were real and things that were genuine and things that happened. Amen. But if it leads you into it leads you away from God to another God which is a false understanding of the word. He says then don't you follow it and don't you go after it because the most important thing is the spoken word is the original seed. And if you stick with the original seed it'll always reproduce itself. &gt;&gt; Don't hybrid it. And so brother's warning the church don't be signers. Don't don't go that direction. Don't be caught up in that. Watch the word. Watch the word. Watch the word. That's why God sent a prophet to bring us back to the word. He sent a word prophet to restore what? The word. With that came signs and wonders and miracles, all the vindications that had to be there. But the purpose of his ministry was to bring us back to the word to bring the people back in contact with their God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's trying to tell the people, don't go that way. Matthew 24:24 says, "For there shall arise false Christ." This is where, brother, the scripture, false anointed ones. False Christs plural, not Jesus Christ, but anointed ones saying, "I'm anointed of the Lord." Amen. And brother Brandman, false anointed ones teaches us they have healings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They have all of these things. But what they don't have is the spo the original spoken word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For there shall rise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect. So what was going to deceive the very elect? Showing signs great signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say they'd all be false. Don't believe them. They're just pretending. No, he said they shall show. They shall definite affirmative in the future. Shall show. That's a hard to say. Shall show. Say that five times fast. Shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect. &gt;&gt; You know what I love about this? The statement between the commas. &gt;&gt; What is the statement between the commas? If it were possible, &gt;&gt; I'm so glad it's impossible. Amen. because of God's predestinated plan and his will for my life. It's possible for me to be deceived as a human being. Very possible. I'm gullible. I fall for stuff. I believe people. If they just look at me and say, "I'm telling you the truth." I say, "Okay, I believe you. Why would you lie to me?" &gt;&gt; But when it comes to election and predestination, it is impossible for this elect to be deceived. &gt;&gt; But there will be great signs and wonders. So, we don't chase the signs and wonders. We chase after the word. Right. &gt;&gt; That's what he's teaching us here. &gt;&gt; And and this message said, "The Bible said in Matthew 24 that I would come to pass in the last days till it would deceive the very elect if possible." I heard Billy Graham say the other day in a message, he said, "The elected is already deceived." Brother says, "No, no, the elected ain't going to be deceived. No, no, they won't be. No, church members will, but not the elected. They was chosen from the foundation of the world. They cannot be deceived. It's impossible. Said Hebrews 6. They will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We don't have to be afraid. Listen, friends, don't be afraid. There's so many times that we're afraid to be deceived. So, we're afraid to hear something different. We're afraid to listen to what's being preached from somebody else. Listen, we don't have to be afraid of being deceived. What we need to do is study the genuine dollar bill until we know what the prophet said, till we understand the tone, the nature, the character of the prophet coming through those messages. And listen, I tell you, you you feed on that true dollar bill. And you listen not just to the words that's being said, but listen to the way he's saying it, the character behind it, the life and the humility and all the things that go with it, and the love that is preached with, the obedience to the father. And listen to me. That becomes the test of true ministry. Amen. Not just the words, but the character behind the words. &gt;&gt; The presentation with the life. &gt;&gt; So study the true dollar bill. And don't be afraid of being deceived. If you're a child of God, you cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; It's prophesied. It's it's it's predestinated. It's the will and plan of God. He brought his word and he brought his spirit in full measure to make sure you're not deceived. And it it doesn't mean that you won't ever misunderstand anything. It doesn't mean you won't take a detour. It doesn't mean you won't get derailed for a period of time. But you're not going to stay there as the predestinated seg of God. God will bring the word your way. And he will use the word to break the stronghold of misunderstanding, wrong doctrine, false teaching. &gt;&gt; Because we can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; So we don't have to be afraid of the message. We don't have to be afraid of the deeper things. We don't have to be afraid. &gt;&gt; And we don't have to pretend like we understand things we don't understand &gt;&gt; because it's not about understanding. It's about receiving. It's about living. It's about allowing God to bring revelation. &gt;&gt; So, we don't have to be afraid of the message. Just relax. Enjoy the word. Feed on the word and let the word reproduce itself in us. &gt;&gt; He's not going to lose his bride. He can't lose himself. And Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He says, "And Satan said, you know, but she turned around and listened to him." But the eve in the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it. Yes, sir. God's going to do it. He knows. He'll have it. He said uh uh a church would be there without spot or wrinkle. She is going to stand there in the splendor of him, his word made manifest. I want to ask you a question. What is the splendor of him? &gt;&gt; His word made manifest. &gt;&gt; That's his objective in this day. That's what he's talking about. What was Jesus? He was the word made manifest. What is his bride going to be? The word made manifest. &gt;&gt; Let's continue reading just a little bit longer. Paragraph 175-5. How can you tell the spirits apart? Just give them the word test. If it's not what the prophet taught, leave it alone. It's not in our Bibles. If it's not the scripture, if it's not been taught by the prophet, leave it alone. If they don't speak that word, they are of the evil one. As the evil one deceived the first two brides, he will try to deceive the bride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself with creeds as something other than what God delivered to us through the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? or just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her. &gt;&gt; So not putting by deceiving her by not putting the emphasis on the restored word but putting it on signs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the absence of restored word, &gt;&gt; turning her attention. But listen, but God never placed signs ahead of the word. &gt;&gt; Signs follow the word. If we want signs and wonders, let's dig into this word. Let's receive the word and let's believe the word he gave us because the word promises signs and wonders. It promises healing. It promises deliverance. It promises laying on of hands. It promises the gifts of the spirit. It's all part of the word. So get the word. Brother Brandham said, "When when I go to buy my shoes, I don't just buy the tongue. I buy the whole shoe and I get the tongue with it." And he's talking about the gifts. What I want is the Holy Ghost. What I want is God. What I want is him. And when I unite with him, everything that he is is included. &gt;&gt; And he can manifest any of it anytime he wants. But he needs a heart that believes it and is expecting it and looking for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But not getting chasing signs, chasing the word, and believing that this word, God, I have followed your word, and your word says, and I expect you to do what your word says because I'm holding on to the original spoken word, which has to reproduce itself. And if your word says by your stripes I am healed. That word has to reproduce itself. It's not hybrid in my heart. I'm believing the original spoken word. &gt;&gt; Go to the word and the signs will follow. &gt;&gt; Believe it on the basis of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Signs follow the word. As when Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first, according to the word of the Lord, when she did as the word said, the proper sign came. Come to the word first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what he's teaching us in the day of Pentecostalism, in the day of the beginning of the charismatic move, signs and wonders, and all the things that were going around. All the fanaticism that spoke up, sprung up after his ministry, he's crying out to it. Come back to the word. It's all in the word. Everything you desire is in the word. Come to the word first and then watch the miracles. &gt;&gt; The miracle, the seed word is energized by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's look at this story in first kings 17. The story of Elijah and the widow woman. First Kings chapter 17. Remember friends, we're coming in an Elijah ministry and God has ordained this woman to sustain him in the time of famine. So now he comes to her in chapter 17:8. And the word of the Lord came to him saying, "Arise, get thee into Zerapath, which belongth to Zidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee." Hey, guess what? The widow woman didn't get the message. &gt;&gt; The carrier never showed up because this plan was in the mind of God and it was going to manifest that. She didn't know. She didn't know that she was commanded to be the widow woman that sustained him. But she was the widow woman that was commanded to sustain him. So what was she going to do? Sustain him. Because she was commanded to do so even though she didn't get a memo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is how God works, friends. He's already ordered our life. He's already commanded us to do things. And it will happen. Even if you don't have the memo, it's going to happen. Just trust that God's commanded your life and he's commanded a purpose in your life. I've commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. So he arose and he went to Zerapath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks. And he called her and he said, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel that I may drink." And as she was going to fetch it, he called her and said, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand." And she said, "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil and a cruise. Behold, I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it and die." Listen, this is the condition of the church when Elijah's on the scene. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The denominational system has devoured the word. &gt;&gt; Because the meal is a type of Christ, the meal offering. She's down to the last little bit of truth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I've only got a drop of oil. I just got a little bit of the spirit of God and a little bit of the word because these two go hand in hand. &gt;&gt; And she goes, "I'm going to bake that cake and die." &gt;&gt; But she wasn't going to die because God had sent Elijah her way. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and and so she says, "I I am gathering two sticks." Brother Beam said those two sticks made the cross over the fire. She had just all she had was the cross and a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil and it was the last bit she had to sustain her spiritual life. &gt;&gt; Then Elijah shows up in the time of drought. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "And Elijah said unto her, Fear not. Go and do as as thou has said, but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and then after make for thee and for thy son." The audacity of this man. Listen, if we knew if we knew a fellow like this, we would call him all kinds of names. You you a man in full strength go to a widow woman with a little boy and she's got the last bed and she's going to give it to them and die their last morsel and you said no listen you just give that to me first. What kind of human being are you? He's a human being. He knows that God is in him. Amen. He is the manifested word for that hour because brother Brandham said the prophet becomes the word to the age. And Elijah was the manifestation of the word for that age. And he was coming to bring her something more than her last drop of meal. He was going to bring her more than their last drop of oil. He was going to bring her in abundance. But she had to be willing to give all unto this ministry and sacrifice everything to him. And when she sacrificed, it wasn't Elijah. Brother Bam said it was Christ in Elijah. And when she sacrificed to the living word for her day and gave her last bit of understanding, her last bit of spiritual life, everything. And she handed it over to this end time ministry. Amen. To this word made flesh. He made a promise. And the promise comes here in verse 14. He said, "For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruise of oil fail until until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth." And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah. And she and he in her house did eat many days, and the barrel of meal wasted not. Neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah. That wasn't Elijah's word. That was God's word because God was working through Elijah. And God was saying through Elijah, "Give me your last. Give me all you've got. Give me everything. And if you give it to me, I'll give you everything you need to sustain you all the way through. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we come to the message, we have a little bit of truth. When we're afraid to lose our little bit of truth, I know that Jesus Christ, son of God, I was raised this way. I've got just a little bit of life and a little bit of this. Amen. But God's saying, don't hold on to that and die. Don't just eat that meager. Amen. But give it over to the manifested word for your hour, and your cruise will not go empty, and your barrel shall not run dry. You're going to have word upon word upon word. And listen, it doesn't mean that she went over and she saw the the meal barrel overflowing and spilling into the floor. It may have been as low as it ever was, but under the Elijah anointing, when Elijah was in her house, when Elijah was in her house, every time she dipped in, there was something to eat. Amen. Every time she needed it, there was some oil on the word to bring it to pass and give her the spiritual nutrition to face the day. Every day Elijah was with her, she had something to eat. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we come back. Listen, I I've come this Sunday. I woke up. I've woken up many a Monday morning things that Lord Jesus, I I preached everything that's in my heart. I have nothing else left. &gt;&gt; We're going to go Wednesday and play a tape, read a book, do something. I'm done. But friends, every day there's meal in the barrel. There's oil in the cruise because because this Elijah ministry is in the house. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't go after signs. Go after the word. Amen. Give the word. Give up everything. And all you get what you get is word and spirit. Word and spirit. Word and spirit to sustain a spiritual life. Amen. When the rest of the world has fallen into drought, we're eating just fine. Amen. When the rest of the spiritual world's gone into apostasy, a complete blackout, utter starvation spiritually and weakening, we're eating just fine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every day there's meal in the barrel. &gt;&gt; Seek the word first. Seek the word for your age first and all these things shall be added unto me. &gt;&gt; It's the lesson we're trying to get here. Brother Bam goes on. We'll continue on in page nine. Says, "How can any messenger sent from God believe only a part of the word and deny some of it? The true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole word. Denominations will hate him. Why will they hate him? Because the true word always exposes the lie. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They will hate him not because he's mean to them. And they'll hate him not because he's a bad person. They'll hate him because he tears down their structure, &gt;&gt; their false structure. His words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who called him vipers, but the predestinated will hear and be ready for the rapture. You might want to circle that word will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no hope so attached to that. The predestinated will hear and be ready for the rapture. You ain't going to miss it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he says, "The royal seed of Abraham with like faith as Abraham will hold to the word with him for they are predestinated together." &gt;&gt; Listen, that widow woman was predestinated with Elijah. &gt;&gt; And this bride in the end time is predestinated with Amen. the Elijah ministry in the end time. She's predestinated with this message. &gt;&gt; And she will hold on to it because she's predestinated with him. It wasn't just Brother Brandon that came predestinated. You came predestinated to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came predestinated to believe it and preach it. You came predestinated to believe it and live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says now the predestin the royal seed of Abraham. I'm going back and reading the sentence again with like faith is Abraham's. So the the royal seed of Abraham, the royal seed of Abraham is the faith seed of Abraham, which is the Christ seed, which is the bride of Jesus Christ because she can live by faith in the word. And Abraham proved who he was by being able to receive the word for his day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the bride is the royal seed of Abraham because she'll receive the word for her day. And he says of Abraham's faith in Romans, therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be shured to all the seed. Not to that which only is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who's the father of us all. As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations. You know, I love this. I've been through the scripture with you all many times, but if you'll just bear with me, I can't stop. I can't help but comment. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he made it. Therefore, it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed. &gt;&gt; Not to just those that are law, but that also which is the faith of Abraham, which is the father of us all. &gt;&gt; If Abraham's my father, then I'm part of the Abrahamic covenant, which is a covenant of grace, unconditional grace. I will do. Not what you do, I will. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what what makes me a part of this covenant of grace is he made it by faith. So that the only evidence I need and the only action I need to be a partaker of this covenant is the faith to believe the word for my day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this whole thing, uh Paul, he's contrasting works and law, the works of the law with faith and grace. And he's trying to show that it's not by the works because if it was by works then God would be in debt. But God's not in debt to no money. It's a free gift of of grace. God doesn't owe us because we did good works. And so now he comes down to this that he made it by faith that it might be by grace to the to to the end. The promise might be sure that the reason this thrills my soul, friends, is because I do not have the capacity to always get it right. &gt;&gt; I get it wrong. I fail. I make mistakes. I disappoint myself. I disappoint the Lord. I repent. I'm ashamed of things that I do. Amen. And if it were based on my conduct and my ability to have good conduct all the time, I would never have to faith to believe I'm part of the royal scene. But God didn't make it part of my conduct. He made it part of faith. And one thing that I can do, there's one thing that I do involuntarily I do when I can't help it. And that's believe this message. &gt;&gt; I don't believe it because I try to. I don't believe it cuz I strain to. I believe it because something inside of me jumps to its feet and begins to shout when I hear this message preached. in its fullness, in its power, and in his word. There's one thing that I can do. I can believe this message. I can believe what the prophet preached. There's nothing he preaches that bothers me. Amen. Things that I don't understand, they don't bother me. I can receive this word. And if I can receive this word, I've got token evidence that I'm part of the royal seed of Abraham because I've got the faith of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that not of ourselves. &gt;&gt; It is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a joy it is. That's one thing I can do. I I can't live the best life. I can't perform the miracles. I can't show all the signs and wonders. I can't have all the gifts. But I can believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the impartation of a gift of grace. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then he says in verse 17, "As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations. before him who he had believed, even God, who quickenth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead. He was too old to produce the promise. Y &gt;&gt; being not weak in faith, he was weak in flesh, &gt;&gt; not weak in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is how Abraham held on to the promise. This is how the royal seed holds on to the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old. Neither the deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was also he was able also to perform. &gt;&gt; That's what brother said. The royal seed of Abraham with like faith is Abraham's. This is the kind of faith the royal seed will have. If it takes 25 years, if it takes 50 years, if it takes 150 years, we're not going to stagger at the promise of God. Though we become inable and incapable, and there's no seeming way reasonably that we can perform what the prophet said we would perform, it does not matter because I believe him faithful who made the promise. &gt;&gt; Not me who's going to work it through, but he who made it is the one that I have faith in. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God. This is how the bride moves. Let's continue on. Is everybody okay? &gt;&gt; We try to wrap up. The last day messenger will appear in God's appointed time. He did. &gt;&gt; This is history. &gt;&gt; Amen. The last day messenger will appear in God's appointed time. It is the end time now as all know for Israel is in the homeland. Any time now he will come according to Malachi. When we see him he will be dedicated to the word was he? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He will be indicated pointed out in the word revelation 10:7 &gt;&gt; and we know Revelation 10:7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel this is indicating his ministry. When he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants, the prophets. And God will vindicate his ministry. &gt;&gt; Did he? &gt;&gt; So, was he dedicated to the word? &gt;&gt; Was he indicated or pointed out in the word? &gt;&gt; And did God vindicate his ministry? This day this word is fulfilled. This prophecy he will preach the truth as did Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion showdown. He says in the message I have heard but now I see. And when the true genuine vindication of the scriptures of this last day message and you see the presence of Jesus Christ that you had heard what he had done in his life and you hear the scriptures say he's the same yesterday, today and forever. And just before the Sodom condition is fired over with the wrath of God, see Jesus return amongst his people, formed in human flesh, who's he referring to &gt;&gt; and do the same thing he done. My, it ought to strike our souls to glory. It ought to do something to us. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben refers to his ministry. He starts referring to the plains of memory when God came in human flesh and a tabernacle of flesh and with his back turned descent began to discern Sarah's heart and began to tell her what was wrong when he came at the time to confirm the promise to Abraham. And brother Bram starts showing that as a sign he even physically demonstrates on the platform by turning us back to people and doing the exact same thing so that we would see this Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, forever. The sign of the Messiah on earth again. What is it? It's God vindicating his voice, vindicating his word. Now the spoken word is the original seed. Come back to the original so that it can reproduce itself. &gt;&gt; Reproduce itself where? Reproduce itself in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, God wasn't wasting all that time vindicating Brother Ben to say, "Brother Bam's a mighty man. He's the greatest thing on earth and it's all in him." He vindicated him so that we would listen to him. So that when we listen to him that we would open our hearts to receive the true word. And when we receive the true word, the true word would come and be anointed by the spirit to manifest itself so that we would become the very pre the manifestation of the preaching of the message is Christ in bride form. Amen. God didn't vindicate him for him. God vindicating for you so that you would open the ears of your heart to listen to this message and receive it so that this message which is Christ can come into you and manifest itself again on the earth. &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the original seed so it can bring back the original life. &gt;&gt; What is the attraction on the mountain? I heard a voice said he's talking about being a Sabinu Canyon when the sword come into his hand. He said that's the king's sword. I said a king knights a man with a sword. He the voice came back said not a king's sword but the king's sword and the word of the Lord said fear not it's only the third pull it's the vindication of your ministry what was the vindication of his ministry mean the vindication of the ministry was God put the word in his hand because he's the last prophet to the Gentiles to restore the full measure and full interpretation and revelation of the word that's the vindication of his ministry Listen, it wasn't all the healings and signs and wonders. Those were a vindication to vindicate him a prophet. But what vindicated him as the seventh angel is when he put the word in his hand and used him to deliver the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What word? The unwritten word. The interpretation of the thunders, the white rock within the rock, the mystery of God now being revealed. That's the vindication of his ministry. &gt;&gt; And he held fast to it. He says in the rising of the sun. Well, if you turn the picture like this, we know the cloud picture. We seen the cloud picture. &gt;&gt; You turn the picture like this and look, you can probably see it from the audience. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See his eyes? Look here. Just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth. Can you see his eyes, nose, mouth? Just turn the picture from this the way they had it. This way they had it in pyramid form. the way it's supposed to be &gt;&gt; to the right. Can you see it? He is supreme judge. There is none other but him. And that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth. &gt;&gt; This is the truth. It is true in making him not a third person but the only person. That cloud, brother couldn't put that cloud there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man could put that cloud there. &gt;&gt; God put it there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And everybody in the world was looking at it wrong until God came to a prophet and said, "Look at it right." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turned it to the right. And there he saw the face of Christ. It was the headship of the word returning to unite with the body to bring the invisible union to what? To impregnate a people on this earth with the original word. So that original word would reproduce himself in what? To reproduce Jesus Christ, the fullness of the word on earth again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where? In you and me, friends. &gt;&gt; It's been the whole point of the whole message. &gt;&gt; And God vindicated it. He proved it and he backed it up. Let's continue on. says in paragraph 176-3, "Many will understand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth." Not that they're taught it true, but it's been considered truth &gt;&gt; because trinity is considered truth. Baptism and title is considered truth. All that's considered truth. When he comes against that, they will not believe. So the question is what's that? this when he comes against that the teaching of scripture a certain way that they consider truth &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; the doctrines of the denominations when he comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers &gt;&gt; amen let's go to our last paragraph now 176-4 on page 10 but this prophet will come. And as the forerunner to the first come crying, behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world, even so will he not will he no doubt cry out, "Behold the lamb of God coming in glory." He will do this. For even as John was the messenger of truth to the elect, so is this one the last messenger to the elect and word born bride. This is how brother Brandham uh words this. I've got the words up here on the overhead. This last paragraph, I brought it up. He says, "But he says, "But this prophet will come." He's referring to his own ministry, the Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7 ministry. And as the first forerunner, John the Baptist cried, "Behold the lamb of God to take away the sin of the world." He's not going to repeat that statement because that's already happened. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But he's yet forerunning. His message is forerunning a second coming. But he will no doubt cry out, "Behold the lamb of God." Sorry, I don't like putting a line through that. That hurts my feelings. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God coming in glory. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's his cry. Behold the lamb of God coming in glory. It's interesting that brother Brandham Well, I I'm going to look at two different statements. when he preaches this in spoken word the original se when he first talks about pick up your pen and write in the message from the Holy Spirit he words this differently and we're going to go look at how he worded it there versus how he worded it here but in between I want to go to this scripture in the breach so we're all tied together said at the sounding of the seven church age the last church age all the loose ends that through these church ages have been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the mystery is revealed down comes is the angel, the messenger Christ who comes at the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ sending his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head. Now remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming. &gt;&gt; So our Elijah is on earth at the time of this coming when Christ returns to his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said that he will be crying out behold the lamb of God coming in glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I don't remember and you might remember but I don't remember any specific time brother Brandham was in the pullpit preaching and under inspiration cried out behold the lamb of God coming in glory. So saying he'll say that doesn't mean he's going to shout that phrase one time like John the Baptist did on the banks of Jordan. But he is certainly going to be shouting out and declaring the lamb of God coming in glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he's coming at the time the seventh angel is on earth. So, he's going to be making this declaration in his ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're on the same page. &gt;&gt; And if you find something different than that, let me know. But I I don't know of it. And so, this is spoken words, the original seed. This is where brother Benham talks about for the first time this experience of pick up your pen and write. And this is the last paragraph what we just read out of the Peramian church age church age book. This is the way he says it. And the end time prophecies will repeat. I believe as the first forerunner came with the from the wilderness and cried, "Behold the lamb of God." The second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doing the same thing as saying, "Behold the lamb of God that &gt;&gt; so crying out, this is him. &gt;&gt; This is his coming. Here he is. He'll probably do the same thing by pointing the people to a word born bride because that's the coming. &gt;&gt; That's where he came to. He came to the word born bride as the headship to the body and invisible union to unite together. It's the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Then he said the bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the peering of Jesus screaming behold the lamb of God will come forth from his lips. God, help us to be ready for this near event. My goodness. A Amen. He He did that in the last quote we read where he took the picture and turned it and see that's our L. He said that's our Lord up there. That's Christ coming. Amen. She's been pointed to the skies as he's saying it's him. It's the supreme judge. It's the Lord of all heavens and earth. Amen. He's come to unite with his bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; this is this is just what I want to say to you as we go off the air this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham words this two different ways. &gt;&gt; But the question is, does he mean two different things? &gt;&gt; I don't think so. &gt;&gt; I don't think so. Here he says he'll say he'll no doubt cry behold the lamb of God coming in glory and in spoken word he says the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a wordorn bride &gt;&gt; crying out this is him &gt;&gt; how's he doing it by pointing the people to a wordborn bride because as she receives the word she becomes the word and she will be so much like him she will be him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 11:7, "For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God." That's Jesus Christ. But the woman is the glory of the man. &gt;&gt; Behold, he cometh in glory. &gt;&gt; What is his glory? The fact that he could redeem a fallen woman. The fact that his blood was enough. The fact that he could bring back the word. The fact that he could restore what Satan had ruined, that he could bring back the masterpiece. That's his glory, friends. And that makes you his glory. Not because you have glory. But it's his glory to redeem you. It's his glory to take a fallen creature lost in the depths of darkness at the end of seven church ages that separated us from the truth of God and to restore it all back. Amen. With signs and wonders and power and manifestation and vindication. That is his glory, not our glory. And when his glory rest upon us, it becomes his glory. And then did this this final messenger will say, "Behold the lamb coming in glory." But then he says the spoken word's original seed, he'll do this by pointing to a word born bride because she's reflecting the glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Cuz she can't do it herself. She can't do it with her power. She's powerless to do it. But he's done it himself in this generation. He came himself. We couldn't make him come. We couldn't force him to come. But he did. The fullness of the Holy Ghost back in the church, the full word with the full life to manifest the word is here &gt;&gt; to show his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why a woman needs to stay under headship &gt;&gt; because she's the glory of the man. That's why she's not to cut her hair because her hair is a symbol of authority. She's under the authority of her husband. That's why this bride is not to trim the word. She's not to separate her power. She's to stay under headship. Because when she stays under headship, her goal is to be the glory of the man. And that man is the man Christ Jesus who is the man. &gt;&gt; Not a man. The man. &gt;&gt; That's what Pilate said when he looked at him standing there. Amen. Beaten and abused and standing there absorbing the sins of the whole world and the wrath of God upon him. Amen. To take it. And he looked at him and he didn't say, "Behold this man." or look at this man. He said, "Behold the man." Because there was only one man that could take back what man lost. There was only one man that could redeem man. There was only one that could fit the kinsman redeemer. And he and Pilate, the authority in that region in that day, stands up and he declares to them all because God makes him declare the truth. And he looks at him and says, "Behold the man." Amen. &gt;&gt; And now the woman which is a type of the church, the bride is the glory of the man. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; let's read that. The vindicated word in his body is his his very victory. What was God trying to do? What was Jesus Christ trying to do? He was trying to get you back to sons and daughters of God so he can reunite you with you. So he could go back to the original purpose and the original thought of God's mind because God wants to be manifest in flesh as a family of sons and daughters of God and fellowship together. And it took a redemption to bring us back. But at the end of this redemption cycle, he's going to show it in his glory, his power. There's going to be a spotless, virtuous bride that's standing upon the word with no more deception, no more deceiving because he's here to carry her through. &gt;&gt; See the death, not in the spirit. When he died, he only died in the flesh. His spirit went to hell and preached to souls in prison. That's right. His flesh only died when he raised it up again and quickened it. Quicken means made alive. his flesh, which is his body. Catch this. He's switching now. He's not going to talk about the body that was nailed to the cross anymore. &gt;&gt; Now he's talking about his body that's on earth now. His flesh, which is his body. And that's the word. &gt;&gt; What was Jesus Christ? The word made flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His body, and that's the word, has been laying dead for years, but it gradually began to come in the reformation. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are we talking about? His body, which is the word, has been dead for years, &gt;&gt; but it's gradually beginning to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And begin to come in the reformation. &gt;&gt; And now she is standing upon her feet. his body. She &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; can you read it any other way, friends? &gt;&gt; Amen. His flesh, which is his body and that's the word. It's been laying dead. What? His body. But gradually begin to come to reformation. What? His body, which is the word. And now she is standing on her feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's friends, that's his glory &gt;&gt; and his victory and the purpose of his death. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I wish I had time to go back into Ezekiel. What? Now, where does he want to go? He does all this and now he wants to go to Ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and show you. He said, "Can these bones live again?" He said, "Prophesy." Said, "How can prophecy come?" Only through the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the word of the Lord. Hear ye dry bones. The word of the Lord and Senu's skin came upon them and they stood up a mighty army and began to march toward Zion. Glory to God. Listen. Glory to God. Oh, praise God. That's him. That's him. The victory. What's him? Can these dry bones live? What dry bones? It's the army of the Lord. It's the church that went down through four stages of the insect that ate it down to nothing but began to come back through three stages. Sin you listen he brother Bam breaks this all down in the message he comes back in these dry just sin you came bone came to bone sin you came skin come came upon it and it's standing back a mighty army and he says then he calls for the wind to come which is what is the wind is the original life the breath of God the Holy Ghost amen in the latter rain and the and the third pull amen the Holy Ghost came back into this body his body his bride body to bring him back to life And then what does he say? Then she's marching on to Zion. Oh, praise God. What is Zion? It's the bride. What happened somewhere along the line? This But this this army never made it all the way to Zion to the marriage of the lamb. But praise God, there's going to be a restoration. Not a new army, but a restoration of the original army, which was the church that came out of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's going to bring it back. He says, "Prophesy." How are you going to prophesy? only through a prophet. It's only a prophet that can bring this body of the bride back to life. The army of the Lord. And what's this army going to do when it comes to life? Finish the journey. The first age didn't finish. She's going all the way to Zion. She's going to enter into Bula land. She's going to be married to the lamb. &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about, friends. &gt;&gt; That's what this ministry is about. That's what the vindication is about. That's why you're here. And that's why your soul is jumping and a shouting and a stirring because this is you. This isn't a doctrine. This is you. This isn't a teaching. This is you. This is the purpose you were born for. This is the attribute that's inside of you that was back in God's mind when he was alone with his attributes thinking of himself becoming flesh. That's what's inside of you. Can't contain itself anymore because it's him coming to the manifestation of this prophecy. And he's coming in his glory. He's taking what was defiled, what was broken, what was cast down, and what was utterly useless, and by his blood, and by his spirit, and by his work, he's restoring the masterpiece again. And it glorifies him, &gt;&gt; not her. &gt;&gt; Him, &gt;&gt; because the woman is the glory of the man. &gt;&gt; That's why we've got to be under hesit. That's why we don't take denomination. That's why we don't seek sign. That's why the only thing for us is the original word. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be pregnant by the word, to manifest the word, to become the word. &gt;&gt; That's the whole point. &gt;&gt; Skin came upon them. They stood up a mighty army and begin to march towards Zion. Glory to God. That's him. &gt;&gt; She will be &gt;&gt; him. Amen. &gt;&gt; His victory, his glory. &gt;&gt; The evidence of his power. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Let's look at this scripture. Isaiah 60. Arise, shine, for thy light has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham preaches this scripture in shalom. Good morning. It is the rising of the sun. Arise, shine, for thy light has come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory, his glory, his glory &gt;&gt; shall be seen upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why the prophet would point to a wordborn bride because the word did the purging. The word did the cleaning. The word did the restoring. And she's become the word. &gt;&gt; He's the word. She's the word. She's reflecting him. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would rather have this than anything this man in our world can afford. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd rather have this truth bubbling over in my soul. I'd rather have it than any pleasure you can give me. Any any any position, any any comforts, any ease. I'd rather have this than have anything because this is more than life to me. This is an attachment that goes beyond any other attachment that I have in this planet. This is something that goes back into the eternities that I hold with me. Amen. It's a token evidence to me. It may not be to you, but it is to me. And it's alive inside of me, and it's real inside of me. And it's power inside of me. &gt;&gt; This revelation is what one makes me love him. This this revelation that makes me serve him. It's this revelation that keeps me repenting and coming back again and again and again because it's not about me. It's about him. It's not what I can do. It's what he can do. It's about him wanting to use me to fulfill his purpose and show his glory. &gt;&gt; May I keep my hair uncut. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No trimming the word. No, no touching it. May I leave it uncut &gt;&gt; under headship with a sign of power, his power, his authority, his word. And that sign be upon me as I humbly submit to him. What was Jesus Christ? He was the perfect son. God had tried out sons before. He had Adam, he failed. He had Noah, he failed. He had Moses, he failed. He had David, he failed. He had Solomon, he failed. They were all sons of God, and they all failed. But here come one that didn't fail because he was the perfect lamb of God. He was God made flesh and God came down and became his own son so that he could be a son that wouldn't fail. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But to restore the masterpiece, he can't leave him alone because it's not good that man shall be alone. He's got to make a help me for him. So, amen. As the as the church came, as they pierced his side, out came the ingredients for the church. And she was to be a help me. But as she moved through the journey, she began to fall away and she began to trim her hair. She began to come out from under headship and she could no longer be his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. She came a dishonorable woman, but he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle. He's going to come back because he said he would because it's it's his name on the line. It's his credibility. It's his promise. It's his word. It's him. He's got to do it cuz he said he would do it. And he will do it, friends. He's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle. And he's going to bring her to that position by the restoration of the original spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's the original seed. And when the original word comes back into a a a predestinated womb, a virgin womb that's been purified by the word, what will that do? It'll reproduce Christ again, the anointed word for our day. &gt;&gt; And it'll be his glory, his power, his life, his work made manifest in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll say again, if they lock the doors and they prevent us from preaching, &gt;&gt; then friends, we're there. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the whole point of what are we preaching for to have church? &gt;&gt; No. To manifest this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you coming together to create a program? No. &gt;&gt; To become this word &gt;&gt; is the point of everything we do and all of our efforts and all of our comingings and all of our goings and everything we're trying to accomplish is to surrender to this word and give him preeminence so that he can finish the work. &gt;&gt; Amen. so that his glory can be seen upon us. &gt;&gt; Oh, it makes me want to surrender. It makes me want to submit. It makes me want to lose my life. It makes me want to give to my husband because there's going to be Listen, just like there was many sons, there was many brides. &gt;&gt; And they all failed. &gt;&gt; Eve failed, Sarah failed, first church failed, every Rebecca failed. day off. Every bride type failed, but he's going to have one that's not fail going to fall because she's predestinated not to. &gt;&gt; And what's going to keep her from falling? Good deeds, good works, getting being nice always. No, she's going to stay with the word and only the word and nothing but the word. And she's going to stick with the original seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So she can produce the original life. &gt;&gt; Oh, God be praised. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together. the musicians, if you'll come. I just got to stop. Oh, isn't he so wonderful, friends? &gt;&gt; What a message from the Holy Spirit to the church. &gt;&gt; What what a glorious thing God has done this day. This prophecy is fulfilled in your eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he's fulfilling the rest of it, friends. &gt;&gt; He's fulfilling the rest of it. And what's the rest of it? Arise, shine, thy light has come. &gt;&gt; May the glory of the Lord be seen upon thee. &gt;&gt; I got one more scripture. I wasn't going to go here, but can I read one more? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 30 26. Moreover, the light of the moon. Do you know that's the reflective light of Christ? That's the type of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun. That means she's going to give a perfect reflection of him. &gt;&gt; There's going to come a time the light of the moon shall be of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven church ages &gt;&gt; fullness, truth, &gt;&gt; finishing of the masterpiece. In the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people and health the stroke of their wound. &gt;&gt; What is our wound? Hybridization. What is the stroke? The the fall in the garden. And this is the day he's going to bind it up. And in that day, the moon is going to reflect the same light as the sun, but the sun is going to be shining a sevenfold light. The full seven seals, the truth and mystery of God, all revealed and brought back to full illumination. And now reflected in the moon. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, may his glory be seen in us, friends, &gt;&gt; as we surrendered to him. Let's just bow our heads together. Oh, heavenly father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for your goodness, for your mercy, Lord. God, we don't even know what to say. We don't even know how to say thanks. It's beyond thanks. It's beyond the language. It's beyond words. It's beyond anything we can do. We can weep for hours, Lord. We We can say thank you a thousand times. It wouldn't even touch the gratitude that's in our soul. God, what can we do, Lord, to touch the the enthusiasm, the excitement, the gratitude, the humility, the the what a the overwhelming feeling of awe that we have, Lord, at looking into your word. There's no words that can do it, but oh God, just take us. Take our lives more than our words. Take our hearts. Take our souls. Take our lives. God, let your glory be seen upon us. God, help me, Lord Jesus, to surrender more than I've ever surrendered before. Help me to lay down my life, Lord. Help me to surrender to you and let you do your work in me. God, give us the courage, the wisdom, the anointing by your Holy Spirit to stay with your original spoken word because that original spoken word will reproduce itself. Help us not to be chasers of men and chasers of programs, chasers of churches, chasers of signs, but help us to be seekers of your word, chasers after you, after your word, your truth. May that become our all and all. May we be willing to give everything up for that. God, sustain us by your word. Grow us by your word. Perfect us, Lord, by your word. And may you take the preeminence in us for that's your great goal for this hour is to have a people that you have preeminence in. Lord, we just want to surrender fresh to you all over again. And not just surrender, Lord. I want to repent. I repent for allowing this world to entice me, to distract me, to tantalize me, to frustrate me, to discourage me. God, help me to get my eyes off the world and back on your word. Help me, Lord, to continually to focus my attention on my headship, my husband, the revealed word, my bridegroom. For there I have joy. There I have peace. There I have contentment. There I have rest. God, there I find my purpose. God, I pray you'd help me to continually stay devoted to you, Lord. Stay centered on your word, to be feeding on it constantly, to be surrendering to it and giving you room to work. Not just me, but everyone in the sound of my voice. May you do the same for them. They have the same desire I have. God, forgive us for wasting time. Forgive us for wasting the precious days and months and years you give us. For God, we know what your purpose is and what you're trying to do. And as you commanded a widow woman to sustain Elijah, you've commanded us to manifest this word. God, just every encounter we have, every opportunity, may you just work in us. Even if we don't understand what's happening at the time, may we just surrender and allow you to work your great plan in our lives. And may your word become everything to us. We love you. We commit ourselves. We commit our life. We commit the service. We commit the people all into your hand. And we have joy and faith and trust that this little bride won't be deceived. She won't be derailed because you predestinated for it not to happen. You will have it, Lord. And our faith is there. And God, may we yield to that and surrender to that. We love you. We thank you.

It's It's like being in heavenly places walking through Bible times again. And I wish we could just understand more clearly what we're actually a part of, but it's happening. And and it's been a year since we've been able to be here. And we stream every service. And you you've been such a strength to us. It's it's been a lifeline. And the word just keeps pulling us through everything. We've had some personal tragedy this past year. We lost a son. We lost my husband lost his father. And Satan's been hitting us pretty hard mentally. You know, you he shakes you to your very core. And when you're there, all you can say is, "Lord, I know I believe. And Lord, though you slay me, still I'll trust you." And over and over through this past year is confusions come and doubts come. And this feels like you're walking a razor's edge all the time. And the term that just keeps coming back to me through the ministry, through brother Brandham, through song is just this, stay with my word. Stay with my word. And he gave me a little song that's just encouraged me. You know, you go through mental battles and when you start singing the word, the devil has to leave. So, I just want to It's real short. I don't know if there will be other verses later, but this is I hope it can encourage someone. Stay with my word, child. Stay with my word. Stay with that certain sound that you have heard.

In me you are complete. I'll take you by the hand and lead you from this land. Just keep your eyes on me and stay with my word. Stay with my word, child. Stay with my word. Stay with a certain sound that you have heard. Don't look to the right or left. Keep your mind stayed on me. And I'll lead you all the way back to eternity. God bless you. Amen. Maybe one of our song leaders can make that a congregational &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand again. Thank you, Sister Anna. That was wonderful. What a capping to the word. &gt;&gt; Let's just stay with it &gt;&gt; and trust him. &gt;&gt; Doesn't have to be complicated. It can be simple. Yeah, &gt;&gt; just stay in submission to the headship of the word. Feed on it. Just love him. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Why does this have to come in this day? So that the bride will know her bridegroom, the revealed word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is the word? It's Christ. What is the revealed word? It's our bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Just love him and make love to him and spend time with him and submit to him and everything will come out just fine. And let's pray a prayer of thanksgiving. I think again. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, God, for the word, for the gift of song, God, for the capping off with the testimony in the word that Lord, no matter what happens, we still live a life, Lord, that sometimes is confusing and we don't always understand what's taking place in our life. But God, you have a purpose. You have a plan. You've revealed it to us and we know it's true. And so God, we're just going to believe and stay with you and love you and put you first. We're going to make you our all and all and surrender our all to you. Lord, we thank you for what you've done for us today. May it have impact in our souls. May the word bear fruit and the gifts of song. May, Lord, may it bring changes in us that reflect your very purpose in this hour. God, that's our desire. We love you. you bless your people as we go. Thank you for this time. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you. Thanks, brother. Can't you see why I'm so happy? I've accepted the word of the Lord.
