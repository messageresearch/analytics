within us as he spoke to us along the way and opened to us the scriptures but when he appeared in the midst in the private setting with the disciples he did more than just open the scriptures he opened their understanding to understand oh God's been opening the scriptures but what we need is for him to open our understanding to understand the scriptures and when the Revelation hits now when the opening of the word when it opens our understanding to understand the open word now it hits and now I love the way the brother wrote that now I know that he desires it's not a mystery anymore why does he love me how does I know why amen I know the mystery I know why he seeks me I know why he loves me I know why I love him so much because of the mystery that's been revealed it took the puzzlement away from the church and brought the reality it's alive oh God as good as you know let's bow our heads together oh dear Lord Jesus we thank you Father well we thank you to be alive in this day when you've opened the scriptures but oh God you're doing such a work in our lives to open our understanding to understand the scriptures to reveal this great mystery so that we can see Lord so we can see now why you love us so and why we love you so for God it's your Eternal plan it's yourself coming into manifestation Lord I pray you'd help us now as we look into your word you would take absolute control you would have preeminence as we surrender ourselves to you for you are the head we follow you Lord we yield to you and surrender to you may you take may you take possession may you take your Liberty may you speak to us according to your desire take these lips of clay as I Surrender myself to you help me to get out of the way Lord so you can come you can Minister your word that you can break the bread of life that you can feed us your waiting sheep for that's our desire Lord we love you and we thank you for the privilege of being here pray it should help us now to hear from you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning it's so good to be here together while we're standing let's turn in our Bibles to Revelation chapter 10. it's going to say it's it's a privilege to be here it's good to see you we have a few visitors it's all sisters of Billa from Germany God bless you it's good to have you back man it's always good to have you in in the service and we're looking forward to spending some time with you it's also good to have my mom here sister Debbie it's always a privilege if she comes too so it's a wonderful day and anybody else is visiting you're very welcome God bless you we're happy that you're with us and we just love to Worship the Lord together we consider it a privilege Amen to sit at his feet amen I want to remind you that Brother Kyle and his family are up in Lorraine they'll be traveling back this evening so keep them in prayer Brother Kyle had Services yesterday he's got service this morning and then they'll be traveling back so remember them let's read here Revelations chapter 10 verse 7 just one scripture but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets man God bless you as you take your seeds and we're going to speak on this scripture here in just a minute but I just wanted to make a couple of announcements I want to remind you that we will not be having a Wednesday service this week there'll be no midweek service we'll be meeting over uh at the campground for The Retreat on Thursday evening for those who can gather on Thursday evening we'll have a service there at seven uh the email packet was sent out to everybody who's registered with all the information I encourage you to go back over it review it again because you don't want to leave anything out you don't want to miss anything and we are certainly looking forward to spending some time together amen what a privilege that God has granted us to be able to do something like this and I don't want to take that privilege for granted but if God's allowed us this opportunity I want to soak up everything I can out of it amen I'm going to give my all to it and I want to receive all that I can also wanted to remind you that the the real Vision behind the retreat I I we talked about it last year but I just want to bring it to your remembrance and I know we have some new that are among us and new that will be going but really it stemmed from a family vacation and I I so enjoyed having my family around and we had special devotions and some special devotions we did on the word and we were so edified we were so blessed physically and spiritually I I told my wife I said why can't the whole church go on a vacation together and that was really the inspiration when you know Jesus was take his disciples and they would draw aside he would draw them aside why because they were tired from service they hadn't even had time to eat so he drew them aside so that they could be refreshed and always when they would draw aside they would Fellowship on the word and so I just pray that we can all just stop the pace of life for a few days draw aside refresh ourselves physically and spiritually spend some time together and fellowship we intentionally try not to make the retreat packed with activity uh you know like Services two three times a day but so we can have time just to slow down and fellowship with one another share meals together amen we encourage we always encourage everybody to to you know we're going to eat so many meals together in this big dining room together try to find a new group to sit with every time somebody you've never fellowshipped with sit down it's a perfect opportunity to get to know him and so it would be great to meet some of those who have joined the assembly within the last year like brother Blake said Derek and Pharaoh brother Derek sister pharah will be there I believe they're supposed to arrive Friday sometime so we'll get to meet them so we're looking forward to that I also want to remind you that the the attire for the entire weekend is casual even during the services but as I always say it's casual but respectful so we can remember us guys don't need to come into service and in our sweaty athletic clothes that we were just yeah you know but we don't need a suit and a tie we don't need things like that it's casual but respectful when we come to service we still want to be respectful that we're coming to service but but we don't need to you know you don't need to get dressed up it's it's a it's a retreat we want to keep that atmosphere amen also want to remind you that Saturday night we'll be taking up the special missions offering we talked about that Wednesday There's a need in the Congo for the church that was not able to complete the building we'd like to help them as an assembly complete that so we're going to take up a a an offering Saturday night during the Saturday evening service we're going to take it up once that's the only time we'll take it so I encourage you to bring your money bring some funds if you want to write a check just write it out to BCF and just put in in the note missions and Brother Dean will take care of that but but would it be nice if we can all contribute even the children everybody everybody contribute so this is something that we can do together to bless another assembly while we're being blessed I mean I think it's a great opportunity to do something like that so amen so just remember to review your packet of information still don't have any word on brother Steve brasson I've talked to him he doesn't have his documentation yet and he says when is the deadline I said if you can get here by Thursday that's fine so what we've decided is we're gonna we're gonna make the call Tuesday night if he gets his documentation by Tuesday he can book tickets and he can come on and arrive on Thursday after that it's going to be too difficult so just keep praying amen we trust God that his will will come to pass perfectly and we're not nervous we're just excited to see what God will do brother Steve can't make it we'll we'll we'll still have a retreat and we'll fill in amen we'll have a good time some of us will be instant in season out of season praise the Lord amen as we look back to the scripture that we read together in Revelation chapter 10. it we're very familiar with the scripture because it's part of the manifestation of the word for our day this is the hour and the day that we're living in that says in the in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we know who that seventh angel is the prophet told us it's the seventh Earthly Angel of the seventh Church age messenger and that angel is William Branham amen the messenger of God and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so we find out through the message and we all are mostly most of us are all very familiar with the message been some of some of the things we say are going to be very much review amen but this is where we're at amen this is the age we're living in this is the awareness that God has brought us through this is the Awakening that he wants us to have is this Awakening in the mystery of God because the mystery of God is going to be finished the Revelation is going to come to what the mystery was that God held in the back part of his mind what was the one thing he wanted to accomplish what was the one purpose that he have what was he trying to achieve with all the Believers Through the Bible what is the scripture written for what what is this all about what were the prophets pointing to and what was the end time Prophet to reveal amen it's all this mystery that God held within himself from Before Time began before anything was created before he was even God when he was Elohim the self-existent one he had a desire he had a plan he had a he had something he wanted to accomplish and that is his mystery it's the mystery of God the mystery of himself and so this is the the place that we've come to and and I believe it's it's we I don't think we could ever emphasize it too much amen because this is the this was the thrust of brother brenham's Ministry everything he did was pointing to this all the foundation that was laid all the loosens that tied together all the signs and the Wonders everything was culminating into one thing and it was this Revelation and brother Branham said the seventh seal that is his ministry it was the ministry of the seventh angel was the seventh seal and his ministry of the seventh angel was Revelation 10 1-7 he comes and he ties it together that was the point that was what he was getting to that was the that was the Pinnacle that was the capping of his of his ministry and so that's why I don't believe we could ever over emphasize it enough I believe it's something that we need to understand but in saying we need to understand it it's impossible to understand without Revelation from God it's not something we can press ourselves into but it is definitely something we can yield ourselves to surrender and open our ears and open our heart and pray that God will give us the revelation of the word and even though God reveals some of these things to us amen I I found and I know you found too that the Revelation is so vast so broad so deep that there's no end to it that it continues to unfold itself that it becomes more real day by day it becomes more Vivid it becomes more impactful amen and so I never want to stray away from that but we see that this great mystery of God in this day should be finished and I wanted to take for a title this morning and just preach on this for a while she is part of the mystery of God she is part of the mystery of God and let's go back to Genesis chapter 2 and begin there we're going to be covering a lot of familiar territory Genesis chapter 2 verse 21. if you think of what kind of people we've been privileged to be when Jesus was able to tell his disciples many prophets and Men of old have longed to see your day they've longed to see these things and you think about the men of God I mean Godly men men who dedicated their lives to God and through his word to teach it to search it and they had so many unanswered questions so many things that they couldn't connect the dots on they tried and they they tried to understand and they tried to stick with the scripture and there were so many things that they they just couldn't put their finger on and all their attempts and so and we live at the day that God has opened the seals and taken the veil off of his word and it's all open to be discovered we may not have discovered it all but it's all open to be discovered we find that in Daniel Daniel was asking when should these things be he wanted to know about the end time and he says go your way Daniel for it's sealed until the time of the end you'll never in all your program ever get it you'll never because it's sealed it's not open and we know there's seven Thunders sealed the mystery and they hid the mystery of the Seven Seals and it wasn't going to be open till the end time and these are Godly men who dedicated themselves holy to the word of God and no matter how dedicated they were amen it wasn't open to them but praise God it's open today amen and if they were that dedicated to see these things when it wasn't available now that it's available how dedicated should we be how sincere how Earnest because it's open it's not sealed away this is the time of the end and the Revelation has been given out like I said we may not see it all but it's available the potential is here the full potential is here there's nothing to hold it back amen because it's been open say God give us eyes to see and ears to hear Lord help me not in this day miss this glorious thing that you're doing but I want to see it more and more and I want to give myself holy to this word amen amen you think of some of the men who who sacrificed their very life just to have a Bible in their own language what would they give to have the open book they sacrificed their life they were in prison they were separated from their families they were chased from their homes all of these things they had their children separated from them they had all kinds of horrible abuses that took place just to have the written word in their language so that they could read it what would they give for the open book God help me not to waste my opportunity as my prayer Lord please help me not to miss what day I'm living in and help me not to miss my opportunity I've told you many times before but but I'll say it again if we could find twelve hundred authentic recorded messages of Paul the Apostle what do you believe would be the monetary value of that if they had an auction and they and months ahead the advertise there's an auction and we can verify these are authentic recorded sermons of the Apostle Paul we have 1200 of them as he traveled around the churches amen preaching and you can have all of these what would the monetary value be and we all have it in our pocket amen I don't want to lose the value because it didn't cost me I don't want to lose the value that I'm holding in my hand praise God such a blessing and I don't want to miss it and the problem is life still happens and we're still human and we still get distracted and we live in an age of distraction where the devil's trying hard to distract all the time but I want with all that's in me to fight it off amen because that's not what I want what I want is right here that's been given to me in this message I want it with all my heart and when I find myself distracted I've got to say no I'm not going this way amen God help me forgive me I want to stay true to what you've given to me in Genesis chapter 2 verse 21 it says in the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones flesh in my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh prophet of God says that's what the church is doing today for Jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is part of the of the groom so we look at this all the way back in Adam and his wife and he was the bridegroom she was the bride the bride was literally part of Adam she was part of him because she was taken out of him and brother remember saying the same thing is true of the Bride because the bride is part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was being fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience same life the same flesh that was spoken word made manifest in Adam because Adam was a spoken word made manifest and that spoken word may manifest when she was taken out of Adam and brought into a separate vessel we'll say or another form she was part of the spoken word manifestation she was part of Adam just because amen she was taken and formed to another figure didn't mean she was something different because she was taken out of the same substance she's just more of the same say it that way or another expression of the same amen so that's why he said the word is that is that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day and so why is it the same because it comes from the same thing it's the word he was the word she was taken out of him she's part of the word and when God separated Adam he was both we find out Adam was Spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created him male and female and in Genesis 2 and on he created Out of the Dust of the earth Man was created in God's image God is a spirit so he's a spirit man then when he become flesh man animal flesh on the earth he is showing portraying here the bride he never taken and made another being but he took part of Adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took the feminist Spirit out of Adam left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminist part therefore part of his Spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to Christ [Music] amen so this is the mystery that's being revealed in our day this is the this is the the unveiling of God for our day in the unveiling of God for our day if if I could say make these statements amen and and you know we we all been together for a while now we Fellowship around this word for a while so I I I I don't feel the pressure to validate every statement I make you know the message you can go and read it but the unveiling of God today amen is really the unveiling of the feminine parts [Music] amen it was the part that left was left mysterious because when Christ came on the scene he was the mystery of God revealed amen he was the invisible God made visible he was the invisible God made into flesh and and he was he was the express image or the exact replica the exact image of God now imprinted into flesh amen and and so now if you wanted to see God you look to Jesus Christ right but that was the mystery of God being unveiled in that day that was part of the unveiling of God that was a great unveiling in his son Christ Jesus amen but veiled within Jesus was another mystery another layer to the mystery a different mystery same mystery amen same mystery just another layer of the mystery was still sealed behind the veil of Jesus Christ's flesh and that flesh was the word made flash amen so the word was made Flash and within that word was other portions of word in that word and those other portions of word were to be you and I amen amen just like the woman was veiled inside of Adam so when Adam come he was the son of God God said let us make man in our image and our likeness amen so now Adam coming down Spirit form and then moving into flesh form he was a mystery of God revealed he was the unveiling of something of God because God said let us make man in our image and our likeness amen so God is now reflecting himself in the son that he's making and so there's a mystery being unveiled in Adam but within Adam is another layer of the mystery because God said let us make man in our image and he made them male and female and when he made them male and female they were still in one form so in that form was another layer to the mystery of God man amen praise God I tell you friends never could this gospel be preached like this until this day I mean sometimes there's times while I'm preaching I'll be preaching under inspiration say something and it takes my literally takes my breath away sometimes I want to I want to stop in the middle of preaching and just go kneel down and cry and pray and say oh God this is the reality this isn't something fun to preach it's not a neat topic this is the absolute reality of our life this is the hour that we live in this is the moment in time we're here this is where we need to prick ourselves pinch ourselves amen because this isn't another neat sermon this isn't a nice title this isn't another thing to entice people to enthuse them to get them to clap their hands this is the living reality of God unveiling himself in our day it is the gospel it is the word on display it is the very thing that God is doing in our day amen more than a sermon for us amen so we keep moving now in Genesis 3 Verse 6 he says when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took her the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat brother man says and I'm going to be referencing Christ as the mystery of God revealed and I'm going to quote from that uh quite a bit today and I just went through it again slowly just recently and and every time I read that message it does something to me it it fires me up he says he typed himself in Adam knowing what was right but walked out to redeem his wife because she was wrong Christ didn't have to be sin he walked out and took sin to redeem his Lost Child and there's a reference here to First Timothy two I'll read it to you first Timothy 2 13. it says for Adam was first formed then even Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression see Adam wasn't deceived by the beguiling of the serpent he knew the word and he knew what was right and wrong but he chose to go with his wife amen because she was his wife because he loved her but it's so deep friends because if you think about it Adam Adam had to make a choice so she partook of the fruit that she gave also to her husband now comes his choice will he partake and will he go with her and he partook and we know according to the Apostle Paul that he was not deceived he knew full well what he was doing it but I would say it this way he had no choice he had a choice but he had no choice because what had just Fallen to the sin wasn't someone else what had just Fallen to sin was him what had just gotten deceived was himself it was you know it's not as though he can say uh you know good luck you're on your own I you shouldn't have done that but I'm going to save myself this is himself it's not he can't listen he he cannot say I'm going to stay in self-preservation I'm going to let you take the hit you go you messed up big you go but I want to stay alive no when she dies he dies when she falls he falls when she separated he separated he he had a choice but he had no choice because she was him amen do we understand and so as the drama plays out of course he has to make a choice it has to be free will we understand all of these things but in reality what else was he going to do that was him she was him that was himself her name was Adam now we see why he loved us and now why we see why he redeemed us [Music] oh praise be to God in the messages the rising of the sun says look notice but God listen God foresaw the bride in the groom it's exactly what happened with Adam when when he says to Adam multiply and replenish the Earth amen he foresaw the bride in the groom he knew what he was saying he knew how it would be accomplished he had a plan and he had a purpose and he knew that he was going to have to give his son a bride to reproduce himself upon the Earth and when God said multiply and replenish amen the woman had not come into a separate expression she was still locked inside as a mystery inside of Adam but he said multiply and replenish she was part of Adam when the Commandment came to Adam the Commandment also came to her yeah yeah that's why also while she was in Adam when the Commandment came there shall not touch either the tree the knowledge of Good and Evil amen when that came to Adam it came to her also because she was there amen she was part of Amen that that dispensation she was part of that word going forth and when God said when God said multiply and replenish the Earth he foresaw the bride in the groom he knew exactly what was going to happen he knew how he was going to bring it to pass he knew he was going to bring Adam into another manifestation unite the two together and he was going to reproduce himself upon the Earth God already knew it so if God foresaw the bride in the groom there what did he foresee in the groom here it says hallelujah seek to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam knowed that he was what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife and Jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her because he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what love what a fellowship Amen in the message of modern events he says but the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world remember you that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were here in Christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself do you believe that look he was in Christ then if you were in God a gene a word a attribute from the beginning then you walked with him here on the Earth you talked with him on the earth you suffered with him on the earth you died with him at Calvary you Rose with him again and now you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus communing with him the word as it feeds into your soul praise God I I don't know why I don't know how but I believe that to be nothing but the truth and I believe it applies to me amen so if we are part of the gene of God an attribute of God a word of God a gene of God part of the original thought of God I would say part is the mystery of God is that fair to say if we're part of the mystery of God then all of that mystery all of that word all of those attributes was poured into Christ because all that God was he poured into Christ amen he was the fullness of the godhead bodily amen he was the word made flash he was the fullness of God in one body and if that's be true and I be part of God and part of the word then I was in him the same way Eve the woman was in her husband and he foresaw the bride in the bridegroom amen let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 now together Ephesians chapter 5. read verse 25. Ephesians 5 and verse 25. in Ephesians 5 25 says husband love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but this should be holy and without blemish so want men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself oh now is that not a revelation let's take it beyond the natural he that loveth his wife loveth himself why does Christ love me so praise God let's look look at verse 32. this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church what's he talking about when he says men loves your wives as you love yourself amen what's he talking about he's talking about Christ in the church so let's go back up and read this again in verse 28 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself that's why it was such a mystery back in the previous dispensations and that there was so many Mysteries and that that and so much uh a lack of understanding and I don't mean that derogatory it's just the seals weren't open the veil wasn't taken off the word there was still a great mystery to this plan of God but there was there was such songs that we would sing like I have no idea why he wanted me I I don't know why he loves me I can't see why he would love me but that song's not applicable today because we know why because we were part of himself amen we know why he loved us we know that Redemption wasn't that he looked down and he saw some poor people that were going to be in a bad State one day and he had sympathy for them and felt sorry for them and said I think I'll save them no he was redeeming himself amen he was saving his children his attributes himself amen and it doesn't mean that you shouldn't still and The Human Side be awed by that say I'm so amazed that he loved me we should say that I'm amazed that he loved me humanly thinking I don't understand why but the Revelation has come to pierce beyond the human understanding and say I do know why he loved me amen because the prophet told me why he loved me the scriptures tell me why he loved me and now I know why I love him because he first loved me and he loved me because no man ever yet hated his own flesh his own body amen he that loveth his wife loveth himself amen why why is it so important that we understand these things in this day because it brings such a rest and such a security and such a stability because if we have no idea why he would choose me a poor retro sinner why he would pick me when I was So Unworthy and so unlovable and we have no idea why then we're not going to understand why he still deals with us when we're filthy and miserable and backslide and fall because his choice preceded our condition his choice preceded our failures amen because his choice preceded our failures our failures can't change his choice so the Revelation brings a rest and the whole Christian experience is based on rest not this constant being so I don't even know why he would pick me I'm just a worthless nothing well I mean obviously we all agree with you you're a worthless nothing but but there's something beyond that amen amen when you want to get up and make yourself a worm and say I I don't know why you chose me I'm the least I'm the worst I'm no good and I say amen I mean I'll send my seat and say Amen so I'm not even worthy to stand here and you you only better me amen I'll keep saying amen because I agree with you but let's go beyond that and get to the reality amen it's not me there's something in me amen that's beyond this flesh that was part of God that was meant to be me a desire that he had to express himself and he wanted to express himself as an attribute as a son that he wanted to be me the real me and that's the part that he's loving that's the part that he's after amen praise God you see how necessary the Revelation is to break old denominational thinking that constantly has the devil pulling us here and pulling us there amen praise God so let's continue on in the scripture 28 so what men to love their wives as their own bodies he's in love with his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherishes it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones I don't know how plainer it can be for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined into his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church so where is the Flesh and bone of Jesus Christ it is his church it is his bride she is the literal body of Jesus Christ the same as the woman was the literal body of Adam amen she wasn't all of Adam because Adam was all of Adam she wasn't a replacement for Adam she was another expression of Adam and she was a further expression of Adam and she was part of the body of Adam because she was taken out of the body of Adam and given another expression so it's another expression of the body of Adam Adam oh I'm going to say something Adam had two bodies amen is that not what the uh Genesis chapter 5 says and the day he created them he made them male and female and called their name Adam Adam had two bodies I I know that's shocking if you're stuck in denominational thinking it's absolutely shocking amen but the reality is that is the scripture amen Jesus never lost his body we know that that flesh body that was nailed to a cross it ascended on high as a representation of a sacrifice Amen to mediate for us he had to take that sacrifice back behind the veil Amen to redeem us and pay for the price for fallen man we know that that body didn't disintegrate that body didn't severe he still has that body amen but he has another body on Earth and that's the body of his bride the body of his church and it is the bones it's the Flesh and Bones of Christ so Jesus Christ has two bodies I mean I hope I don't get labeled as a heretic for believing the Bible amen it's just shocking remember how brother Branham said many true ministers will misunderstand the message because they were taught scripture in a certain way yes yes is it good ministers true ministers they will misunderstand the seven things was messaged they will misunderstand because they were taught scripture in a certain way I'll tell you friends because of the denominational systems the scriptures were taught wrong and many times our original understanding of the scriptures even what creeped into the message is not the true revelation of those scriptures they make sense intellectually they're logical to the language but they are not the revelation of that scripture because the prophet came to give us the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication and many times he would say that scripture means that and it's the opposite of what I thought it meant so then I'm faced with a challenge do I stick with my forefathers do I stick with uh Wesley do I do I stick with all the Bible commentaries or do I stick with the prophet that God sent to interpret the word amen and that's why so many people have a hard time understanding the message today they had a hard time understanding the message in Jesus day because of their understanding of the scriptures absolutely the truth they had trouble understanding the message in Jesus's day because of their understanding of the scriptures the way they understood the scriptures confused them about the manifestation of the word before the right when the scripture was made plain and flesh before them and interpreted they didn't understand it because of the way they had been taught the scriptures I said God be my teacher teach me the scriptures Lord you've opened the he's opened the scriptures now open my understanding to understand the scriptures that you've opened it's so needful so we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones this is a further expression of Christ it's Christ expressing in church form bride form feminine form his body a continuation of his body brother man I've got questions and questions and answers on the seals when he comes and he does that uh on the seals the question is is the bride of Christ and the body of Christ the same he said yes sir that's pretty easy yes sir he said now I don't want to get started on that because I'll preach a sermon on it I won't do that but I want to show you when God gave adam his bride from his side she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone is that right when God give Christ his bride the spirit gave the flesh the bride he was pierced in the side under his heart and water blood and Spirit came forth that became flesh of his flesh bone of his boom We Are The Flesh and Bones the bride will be the Flesh and Bones of Christ praise God it's hard to argue with the prophet and the prophet like the prophet brother man when the prophet Paul the Apostle it's hard to argue with those two Prophets when they Converge on anything I mean it's pretty tight in First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 27 it says now ye are the body of Christ now you are the body of Christ and members in particular so that makes you just a part of that body amen and Paul the Apostle learned this firsthand when he was on the road to Damascus and on the road to Damascus amen you know you've struck down by a pillar of fire and the pillar of fire spoke to him and said Saul Saul why persecutives thou me and he says Lord who are thou and he says I am Jesus whom you persecuted Paul immediately his Doctrine changed and a fraction of a moment all of a sudden he caught a revelation amen you weren't talking about catching a revelation he caught a revelation those people he was holding the prison those people that he was persecuting amen that was Jesus Christ is that also the Bible why persecuted on me Jesus wasn't persecuting Jesus at this stage Jesus had already been crucified dead and resurrected there's nothing he could do to that form of Jesus but now Jesus was in another body in another form and he was persecuting Jesus by persecuting his body the church so you see that's that's so scripturally sound and the message spoken word is the Original Seed he says and the angel showed Abraham who he was and that he was the word and why did Sarah laugh so he called her forth and she said I never but he said but you did what the grace right there God would have slew her right there but he couldn't see our stupidity he'd kill every one of us but he can't to kill Sarah he had to take Abraham because Sarah was part of Abraham they were one in Union and to take the church and destroy it he can't do it because it's part of himself Hey listen have we failed we failed has the church failed they have absolutely failed have we of individuals failed we have failed but to take us and destroy us he can't do it because it's part of himself and God cannot lose himself Christ cannot be condemned Christ cannot be destroyed amen amen because it's part of himself Christ part of himself the word being made flesh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound couldn't do it you get it he couldn't kill her he couldn't take her life because she was part of Abraham she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone why that goes all the way back to a prophecy that Adam laid out when a man is joined to his wife they will be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and they will be one flesh and God honored that Amen in the marriage and he honored that in Abraham and Sarah they had become one flesh she was now part of Abraham and he could not destroy her without destroying Abraham he couldn't hurt her without hurting Abraham amen and so now he cannot hurt us without hurting Christ why because they're one flesh he said but you couldn't take the church he can't kill the elected he can't take your life because you're part of him you're the word the word is in you it's manifest itself proving itself love joy peace long suffering all the words of God you believe every one of them them work and God working through you you're a part of the word which is Christ and we are taught that he is the word and we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone there you are amen amen you were talking about a doctrine of eternal security amen the the Calvinism teacher they thought they had it but they did not have it the prophet had it he could go beyond that and go all the way back to the back part of God's mind and show eternal security before there was time oh praise be to God and the message is the rising of the sun he says and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics amen she is him so my brother Brandon would come in the seals and he would say now I'm going to call you bride so that you'll get it there's something you have to understand it's got to go to a different level like church is a correct term but I'm not going to use church because it's too General I'm going to call you bride so that you're going to get what I'm talking about in these seals and the message it is the rising of the sun he says when God made his first bridegroom he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman and spirit formed him in the dust of the earth to make him material and notice when he made Eve from Adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word for Adam was a spoken word he took him he took from him and then taken he had a masculine and feminine Spirit then he took the feminine spirit away from Adam and placed it in Eve so it's still part of Adam's spirit to catch that it wasn't Eve Spirit although it was the feminine Spirit but it was the feminine part of Adam's spirit [Music] so it was Adam's Spirit yes What Spirit did you have Adam's spirit praise God and even though there was a difference in expression now there's masking now there's a division of where it was all masculine feminist in one now there's a division of expression the expression comes forth the the physical form is slightly different the expression is slightly different but it's the same it shows how you can be the same but different she was never there to replace Adam now she can't say well I'm Adam and you're nothing no he was Adam amen she was Adam he was Adam she was Adam she was another expression of Adam Adam's spirit it's Adam's flesh then it was Adam's Spirit the dynamic that quickened the mechanics of his body so the the bride must also be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh it says we'll get to that in a minute and see how it's done it's a question I want you to hold in your heart for a minute how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh then he goes to a scripture and I like to read this scripture together if you will let's go to Romans chapter 8. he's going to start showing us how this mortal flesh can become his flesh Romans chapter 8 okay verse 8 let's start at verse 8. he's going to only read one script scripture but I want to back up and catch more context Romans 8 8. so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell on you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness and this is the verse that he reads verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you brother members going to start showing us how this mortal flesh can become his flesh and he says if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by a spirit that dwelleth in you until I came to the message being raised in church raised all my life in church reading my Bible all of my life if you would have asked me to read that scripture and interpret it to you before the message I would have told you that that's a promise of Resurrection that after I die if I die with the spirit the spirit of God being me he'll raise me up but brother Branham does not handle this scripture that way he's not speaking of a resurrection after you physically die in the resurrection of the Saints but the Rapture time that is not how he views this scripture if we view that scripture only that way then we're going to miss the power that is unlocked in this scripture because this is how our mortal flesh will become his flesh again in the message the rising of the sun were just a few paragraphs later he said but brother when you hear the scream there's something in you you're an eagle to begin with you are that seed that the resurrection of the son has dawned and the wave Chief upon the Earth where was that to make you recognize that you're an ego and not a denominational chicken what was what was the the rising of the sun brother man is preaching it is the rising of the Sun and he's showing the resurrection of the son he's saying the Sun is up he's not talking about just 2 000 years ago a resurrection that was the resurrection of Jesus body amen but in coming out of the Dark Ages there had to be another resurrection and it had to be a resurrection of the word amen and he says so now the resurrection of the son has dawned and the wave Chief upon the Earth to make you recognize that you're an eagle and not a denominational chicken so all of a sudden what was the return of the word for why did the light come back amen why did the wave Chief get waived what was it all to do it was to help you and I recognize that we're an eagle and not a denominational chicken not so that we can say isn't that glorious the words return Isn't that glorious there was a way she it is glorious it was glorious but for me there's a greater glory in the Revelation that that came to unlock and who I am if I see that the son has risen and I see that the wave Chief went forth and I see that Malachi 4 has been on the earth and I can see that there's been a voice of the seventh angel but I don't see what that means to me then I have missed the purpose of God sending all of them I can rejoice in the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 I can rejoice in the wave she's being waved I can rejoice in the word returning and still blind and stuck in spiritual Amnesia and not really understanding who I am and if that's the case I haven't yet got the full benefit of Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7. the wave sheath the rising of the Sun he goes and says if the spirit that raised him from the dead now he's coming back to the scripture if the spirit they raised him from the dead the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body amen not will someday down the road after you're dead and laying in the grave and the Resurrection comes now he's talking about if that Spirit which is what the Dynamics of the word that you've received amen it dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body now he goes back to the question now how wave flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone he said I'll answer that in just a few minutes now we'll hear a few paragraphs later he's going to say how now how are we flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because here comes the answer yeah yeah quickly why were you were yet mortal Sinners mortal ready to die these bodies it quickens that body what's Quicken brings to life the spirit that once liked to drink run around commit adultery and all these it's quick and why the thing died and you are Resurrected it quickens your mortal body Therefore your bodies is the Temple of the Dynamics because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanics there is your Resurrection this is the definition this is the interpretation of Romans 8 11 not someday if I receive the Holy Ghost I have a Resurrection coming if I receive the Holy Ghost it is my Resurrection coming yeah I'm in the Resurrection The Resurrection is in me I'm resurrected from Death from the deadness of an old mortal flesh and old Mortal ideas and resurrected with newness why because the the Dynamics of that word the life of the word has come in me to make this body live that word that I believe there is there is 8 11. amen there is the correct interpretation not the denomination but the correct one now when you go back and read it it's so obvious so so they then are then in the flesh cannot please God so I have to die to please God yes but not the death you're thinking about not the one that put you on in the grave under the dirt but the one that causes you to surrender your life the death that causes you to hate yourself and hate everything you are and you're the genetics that you're made of and all the habits of your life die to self this is the death they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you're not in the flesh I'm not in the flesh but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you so how do I get out of the flesh ah when the spirit of God dwells in me it'll Quicken this Mortal body and now I'm Not In the Flesh the old Spirit of the flesh the old nature of the flesh am I in the flesh I'm in the flesh but it's totally different there's another Spirit living outside of me not the old fleshly spirit oh praise God now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead oh he's not talking about the death we're used to he's talking about the deaths we really need if Christ been you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you he that raised Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you so if Christ dwell in you you reckon yourself to be dead your body is dead there's nothing I can do there's no good in me I have no capacity but amen if the spirit of him that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you he will Quicken this Mortal body and now the body can come to the life of the word praise God oh I love the message you know what the message is done it has stopped the plotting along waiting for something to happen someday the Lord will come back someday it all someday we'll have a Revival someday this is the Revival someday it'll be a restaurant this is the resurrection he says he says there is your Resurrection the question is have you had a resurrection are you resurrected are you quickened is your mortal body alive alive not into the flesh but alive unto the spirit to live out this word there's your Resurrection amen not waiting some day something glorious is going to happen the Glorious thing is happening right now Friends when the word is being made alive in flesh what flesh Christ flesh amen how is this Mortal body going to be his flesh he just told us praise be the god oh now I'm going to read the last part of this again because I got so excited I forgot one of the most exciting parts said Therefore your bodies is the Temple of the Dynamics we read this because why why is your body the temple front the Dynamics how is this even possible why from the beginning you were part of the mechanics if you weren't part of God from the beginning and part of the word this will never work for you but if this works for you it's because you were part of the mechanics from the beginning so the Dynamics can come on the mechanics no mechanics no Dynamics why from the beginning you're part of the mechanics oh there's your Resurrection there is the church in the resurrection with him these bodies right now are quickened amen amen oh see you've heard you believe it changed you from a denomination to the word there's the quickening power again in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says he is the head of the church which is his body and he wants the preeminances listen now listen close while we're going he is to be the head of the body his bride's body which is taken from him flesh and Bone like in Adam see Bride born from the dead so he he needs a body that's born from the dead he needs a bride that's resurrected amen amen that's born from the dead let's read it again born from the Dead Sea that's born from the dead sin of unbelief what killed Eve unbelief is that right their own belief in what unbelief in God no she had faith in God sure there is she never said there's no God no sir she wasn't an Infidel she said you know I don't believe his word at all no she believed all but one little thing so what he wants to become the head of the body the bride body which was taken from him flesh and Bone like an Adam born from the dead what born from the dead what resurrected from the dead does this bride need to be from the death of unbelief which we were trapped in because of denominationalism in man's teaching again in crisis and mystery he says notice the Vindicated word in his body is his victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his Spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that's right his flesh only died when he raised it up again and quickened it Quicken means Made Alive his flesh which was his body now brother man is not just rehearsing something that happened he's going to relate it to something that's going on in this generation he's saying when Jesus died yeah you can't kill Jesus Christ you can't kill amen what's Immortal amen but you can kill the body and what was the body the body was the word made flesh so he's going to type this death of Jesus Christ laying in the grave with the death of the word this is how he's tying this all together he didn't you can't kill the spirit his flesh only died when he raised it up again and quickened it Quicken means made of lime his flesh which was his body and that's the word we got it we're on the same page now he says it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she's standing on her feet amen what body is this it's the word what word it's her she is that she went into the grave at nicaea she died amen the bride tree was withered down by the four stages of the insect until it got it down to the root it was laying there like it's dead brother Branham is typing the condition of the church with the condition of Jesus after crucifixion he laid in the grave what not the spirit the word the body the word made flesh and now he comes and says but it's been laying dead now for years why because of romanism and denominationalism it has killed the effect of the word and the people and misinterpreted mishandled it and withheld it from the people but there's going to be a resurrection in the third day amen it's coming to the fourth stage of Life the word is coming back and now she's come back through the Reformation what was the Reformation Luther Wesley Pentecost and now she's standing on her feet what is it the resurrection of the word which is the resurrection of the body which body Christ's body his bride what day are we living in we're not in a Reformation we're not in a stage of coming back this is the resurrection this is the rising of the sun this is the return of the quickening power to Quicken the body to life Hallelujah now she's standing upon her feet don't worry look where he goes next oh how I wish I had time to go back into Ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and show you he said come can these bones live again yes he said prophesy [Music] how can prophecy come only through the prophet it's the word of the Lord hear ye Dry Bones the word of the Lord and sin you escape upon them and they stood up a mighty Army and began to March towards Zion glory to God that's him that's him the victory what is he talking about he's talking about the resurrection of the church out of the death through nicaea through the Dark Ages coming back through three stages of life amen but if you go back to Ezekiel in Ezekiel there was four stages coming back there was three that brought her back to her feet that brought the Army up bone came to Bone send you to send you flesh upon flesh and now it's standing there but they're not in motion yet because the word was returned through the Reformation Bibles came back brother Brandon was there to tie all the loose ends together but they needed something else it needed a lot of rain it needed a third pull it needed about pouring of dynamic power and it took another word of Prophecy Hallelujah the fourth stage yes breath yes wind life spirit the quickening power came back in and they marched a mighty marching Hallelujah oh praise God where are we friends where are we and what effect should it have on us it says in Christ and mystery God revealed again he says but I'm talking about the headship of Christ being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price and is raising up the head and he stops it up or the body what's Christ raising up now he's raising up the body what body his body again he says then he says the bride body must follow the head for it's part of his resurrection and part of his mystery amen amen what body the bride body what body is that could that be the part we're part of yeah the bride body the true church the bride of Christ the body of Christ on the earth the many membered body which were members of the Bride body must follow the head for it's part of his resurrection and part of the mystery so I titled this she is part of the mystery of God she's part of the mystery it's impossible for it not to go oh my it's part of God's mystery we say Revelation 10 7. she's part of the mystery of God when we referred to Revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished listen friends the bride body is part of that mystery remember because the great plan that he had in the back part of his mind it unfolded in three folds the first was to get preeminence in a man he did that in Christ Jesus the second is to get preeminence in the people and third a return back to Eden the second party's accomplishing now the bride body must follow the head for its part of the resurrection and part of the mystery it's impossible for it not to go oh my it's part of God's mystery how God revealed himself here and raised it up by the word so he Reveals His church and raises it up by the same word it's part of his threefold mystery a few paragraphs down he says I'm trying to bring you the threefold Revelation or the mystery of God we can say she is part of the mystery of God but the real impact comes when you say I'm part not by Merit but by God's grace not not for any reason that I can tell you in myself except he chose before the foundation but I am part of that mystery and the reason I'm on this Earth may this revelation dictate to us our true purpose because the world tries to give us all kinds of purpose things we need to accomplish things we need to do a purpose in life but this is our purpose and may this Revelation dictate to us personally what our purpose is again he says not them people the headship in the body has become one unit it's God manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer Twain They are one God in his church is one Christ in you God's Great revelation what is God's Great Revelation Christ in you Christ in you the hope of glory this is the great revelation glory to God even bearing his name his name is Jesus the anointed the reason he is called Jesus he is the anointed it's the anointed Body of Christ proving manifesting God like that body did and that body redeemed every one of these bodies and and through there God works his threefold manifestation going to the kingdom now we're back in the uh it is the rising of the Sun he says remember he went there with you and him see God never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body that's why we don't go to judgment this is the reason we do not go to condemnation we do not go to judgment there's no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus why because I was in Christ Jesus there brother REM said he made me pay for my sins there I you know say your brother Ted comprehend that explain that to me I can but I believe it friends I can't explain that to you but it's the truth so he says now he says he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride all of a sudden this changes things the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride was that true in Adam's day yes when God said to Adam multiply and replenish the Earth that same word spoke to the bride when he gave them word and says don't don't partake of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil when he says that did that also apply to the bride yes sir so the word that applies to the groom also applies to the bride praise God now this just opened up the whole Bible that understanding just opened up the whole Bible because now what what verses apply to the bride let's find the bride's verses you'll find the brides verses coupled in the Grooms verses because what he spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride [Music] is it the same word spoke of the group speaks of the brine well how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride I'm going to read that again thank you so that it can hit home pay close attention how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised to him why because the scriptures that pertain to him pertain to her also The Works that I do you'll do also right so how can the Bride come and not manifest everything that was promised of him and how and the groom come do we believe in the coming of the Lord do we believe the groom come the bridegroom is descended so he says now he's going to tell you what to look for and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride so when the groom comes what is the groom he's the bride where's the groom in the bride what form is he in he's in the formation of the Bride he's in Bride form amen how could the groom come and not be the bride why because she's a further expression of the groom she was in the groom it's the groom's body it's the groom's spirit how could the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride this is what confuses so many people about the coming of the lord they're looking for the bridegroom the Mighty God the mighty Angels descended where did he go where did he go he's descended did he go back what are we looking for you're looking for the wrong thing when he comes how could he not be the bride because this is bride time bride manifestation this is the time that he is expressed in her man because she's part of the mystery and that part has to be expressed but it's got to be him and her she can't do it on her own it's got to be the same spirit that quickened him that's got to Quicken us oh I love that so let's go back to Genesis chapter 3. I just want to grab a couple quick scriptures and we'll move on because of the same scriptures that speak of the groom speaks to the bride Genesis 3 15. all right put on your spiritual jackets and I would put enmity between thee and the woman in between thy seed and her seed and thou shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel this is a prophecy of the seed of the woman coming this is a prophecy of Jesus Christ and what will Jesus Christ do he will bruise the head of the serpent is that right and thou shalt bruises heal this is a prophecy concerning the bridegroom do we all agree let's go to Romans 16. Romans 16. and verse 20. Romans 16 20 says in the God of all peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly I thought he was going to be bruised under Jesus Christ's feet I thought Genesis 3 15 was referring to Jesus Christ and it was but here Paul comes and says and the God of all peace shall Bruce Satan under your feet whose feet the bride's feet the church's feet who's he speaking to in Romans he's speaking to the bride he's speaking to the church so now the scripture that speaks of the groom speaks also of the Bride [Applause] you know brother Branham said he was sent to destroy the works of the devil his bride is to do the same thing why because the scripture that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride the prophecy of him bruising the head of the serpent amen that applied to Jesus Christ absolutely but don't forget the prophet said that scripture has manifold interpretations and manifolded fulfillments and absolutely that was a prophecy of the seed of the woman which was Jesus Christ but Paul picks it up and says no there's a continuation going on because this is not the end of his body his body is still being expressed and he still has feet that he can put Satan under this is why denominational thinking will never work because the denomination says there's the prophecy there's the Fulfillment it's done but the prophet can look because he has the spirit of the author that can tell him no it's not done amen Paul the Apostle could come and say that's not done because God the God of all peace shall finish this prophecy under your feet oh I love when there's a prophet on the scene that can make the word live it wasn't for that we would leave it stuck there but then what would we do with Paul oh thank God Almighty let's go to John 1 1. praise God we're almost done I'll have you know I deleted three pages of notes right before I came because I wanted to fit this all in today I don't want to wear you out but my it's becoming so much more alive to me day by day hour by hour John 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God who's that scripture referring to denominational thinking would say Jesus Christ and it would be correct but how many times brother Branham says you're the word you're part of the word you're an attribute of God you were in his thinking you're a thought of God an attribute a word of God and so in the beginning was the word I don't know anything other to do than believe that I'm part of the scripture I don't know any other way to view it with the prophet's message and say I here I am in Genesis 1 1 amen I'm here amen because something in me was there amen not my conscience not my understanding not my flesh not my human Spirit that's not what I'm talking about but in my soul amen there was something that was there when it's referring to in the beginning was the word if I'm part of the word I was there if the word was made flesh and nailed to a cross brother Benham said if you're part of the word you were there that day on Calvary the bride was in the body if I was there then I have to be there in John 1 1. amen amen amen said God help us yeah help us as your children to break away from all this childish understanding of the scripture give us the isab this message to wash all the crud out of my eyes so that I can read this Bible correctly because the scripture that speaks of the groom speaks also of the Bride in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was gone the same was in the beginning with god let's go to verse 14 and the Word was made Flash and dwelt Among Us what should I do with that scripture [Applause] what should we do with this scripture should we leave it parked 2000 years ago or should we believe that it also applies today amen but the the word is being made flesh today right now in the flesh of Jesus Christ in his bride body [Music] amen then the prophet tell us that scripture has multiple fulfillments here's what he says in the invisible Union and Jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner that I might become him the word you know I think sometimes we hear things so many times we it doesn't the full impact of the statement escapes us he just said God came in in the form of Jesus Christ and took your place so that you could take his place the word he was the word and now by his Redemption power he's brought you back to be the word he said amen let me hold true to it not the church the word oh that spiritual union of Christ in his church now did you hear the word now the spiritual union of Christ the church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day now let's go back to John 1 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us what should I do with that verse amen is the same scripture that applies to the groom does it apply to the bride is the word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming the word it's happening friends day by day let's go to First Timothy 3 16. First Timothy 3 16. and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh is that true okay God was manifested in the flesh Karma justified in the spirit so who was justified in the spirit God is still referring back to God we're on the same page so you could read it like this God was manifested in the flesh God was justified in the spirit God was seen of angels God was preaching to the Gentiles God was believed on in the world and God was received up in the glory you get that how much of that took place in the ministry of Jesus Christ in his Earthly Ministry he was not preached unto the Gentiles while he was still on Earth in his Corporal body that came through the Apostle Paul and the disciples but it was who preached unto the god it was who believed on in the world that's still taking place today friends that's God and it's God who will be received up in the glory when at the Rapture of the church is God who will be received up in the glory it's the full cycle of God God manifests in the flesh God justified in this fear God seeing of angels God preached into the Gentiles God believed on in the world and God received up into Glory when I was in denomination I only saw Jesus Christ and I left that 2000 but it doesn't fit the scripture what fits the scripture is the revelation of the hour this message makes this Bible Alive makes it true amen praise be to God wash us Lord wash us from all the wrong teachings mystery of God revealed again he says it goes right by them and they don't recognize it until it's gone is that the pattern in the Bible it only picks up the predestinated seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the Earth the same thing came through in the days of Noah the same thing came through in the days of Moses Days of Elijah days of the prophets days of Jesus on down through to this very hour the pattern hasn't changed they don't recognize it until it's gone it goes right by them and they don't recognize what don't they recognize in this day the Grooms come and how could the groom come and not be the bride oh they didn't recognize it Noah's day Moses they Elijah's day the days of the prophets on down through this very hour the pregnated person with the seed of God the word in there manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of God that the word and the word alone manifest itself in this person The Prisoner an individual that's what's being missed in this day you know I I was meditating a little bit ago and I was thinking of The Parables that brother Branham would tell I hope it's okay if I call them parables but the man would tell stories and a Parables a story a man that teaches the truth and so brother Brandon was teaching by Parables you start to think about the the story of the eagle in the chicken yard we have that story where the eagle the farmer took an egg out of an eagle's nest and he put it under a hen and it hatched out and began to be raised by this hen in the chicken yard and the eagle thought it was a chicken because it was born under a chicken tried to act like the chickens didn't fit in but one day Mama Eagle knew that she had another baby and she went hunting that baby and when she flew over the Barnyard she saw her baby stuck in the barnyard and she let out a scream and when she screamed the piercing screamed it frightened the chickens and they scattered but the eagle looked up because something in him connected to that screen it resonated inside of him and he looked up and saw a being with 14 feet wind span and amen and he said whatever that is that's me he reflected himself in that being and then he wanted to know what to do and and Mama scream come up here son you're an eagle and he says how do I get up there and she says just flap your wings and he got on the post and then he flew to the skies we know that story brother bam tells it how many times I never looked it up dozens and dozens at least then he tells another story he tells the story of the soldier with amnesia coming back from the war but he had gotten Amnesia from the war and he's on a train and the soldiers have to watch over him because they can wander off and all of a sudden they come to a train depot and they stop at a certain stop and when he gets out he sees all the all the soldiers are getting out and stretching their legs and stretching their back and walking around and all of a sudden the funny look comes over the face of this one soldier this soldier's got amnesia he doesn't know his name he doesn't know his Papa's mama he doesn't know he was born he doesn't know who he is he's completely lost his identity amen but all of a sudden something strikes and he begins walking and instead of stopping him the guard that was watching her and begins to follow him and he goes down the road and he looks around and he turns her eye and he turns left and he goes out of town and he finally walks up to this house and in the house is that soldier's mama and he walked back home because when he got back in familiar territory he started coming back to himself and he recognized who he was and where home was it went all the way back to home it's another parable then there's another Parable tells of the duck it's very similar to The Eagle he only tells it once or twice but there's a duck that was hatched out with a bunch of chickens thought it was a chicken too and it couldn't clock it would Quack and he was an odd duck and you know never fit in and it would wander around the Barnyard and it would follow the hen and do all the things that chickens do but one day the hen wandered down near the pond and when it wandered down near the pond that duck got a whiff of water and as soon as it smelt the water he said that duck went to the water as hard as it could go amen no matter how much the chicken clock to call it back it couldn't there was something in it attracted to the water and it ran to the water and swam to the water it's another story then the other one is one of my favorites he tells the story of the little boy who grew up in the country and he never seen a Looking Glass before and he went to his aunt's house in the city and and he went to run upstairs where she had a big full-length mirror and he would ran upstairs and also and he stopped because there was another little boy in the mirror you raised his hand the boy raised his hand he scratches his nose the boy scratched his nose he waves in the boy ring and finally he hollered back he said Mama it's me that's me that's who I am that's what I look like that's my identification how many times did brother man tell these stories what do they all relate to they all relate to one thing that's finding your identity that's knowing who you are that you were born in something that's not you you were raised in something that's not you you've got amnesia through the battle you don't know who you are you don't know your identity you think you're something you think you're a chicken you think you're this you don't know what you are but when you come in contact with the mirror of God's word it's supposed to bring you identification that whatever this word is I am what was Brothers Venom's Ministry what was he trying to do with these stories these stories are all about you finding out who you really are amen amen how many times did he tell it how many times did he labor and how many times we talk about how neat it is the eagle and the duck and all that's named The Boy in the mirror and the whole time he's trying to get you to realize amen that you're part of this great mystery Revelations 10 7 you have something to do to fulfill Revelations 10 7 that in the beginning was the word you're there amen all the way through you're part of this mystery of God this message wasn't about William Branham this message is about Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is to be expressed in Bride form in this day oh praise God Don't Let The Parables go over our heads because they're simple stories let it awaken something deep in our heart when we get back into the familiar territory of the word when we get the whiff of the water of the word amen let us run like a duck back to the water let us go like that Soldier back to home amen we've been stuck in this life and spiritual Amnesia we have no identification we've never seen ourselves correctly like that little boy in the country we didn't know really what we looked like amen but this word has given us a proper identification and when we look at the word can you holler out Mama it's me it's me this word is me I'm part of it I was part of it before the foundation of the word when it was a thought I was part of it when it was a word I was thought of it when it was logos I was part of it amen right that's what the message came to do friends it's the eyes have so that we can see amen that's why I get so hurt When I See This truth withheld minimalize downplay and we go back to denomination and go back to other things that's not what this message came for this message came to awaken a bride amen he says they haven't recognized The Awakening of the Bride what is it it's the latter rain it's the third pool it's the opening of the seals what is that it's the Awakening of the Bride it's the breaking of spiritual Amnesia it's the eagle Scream It's the whiff of water it's the familiar territory to do what to bring us back home it's why when we do different things with the message and fulfill our own agendas and create our own doctrines and have our own movement it's all an absolute travesty because it came to open our eyes to look into the word and for Spiritual Amnesia to break away and say it's me mama that's me I now know who I am I now know where I came from and I now know where I'm going I now know what my purpose is now my mysterious misunderstood life why I felt the way I felt and why I've had trouble the way I have trouble and all the things that God has done to move me now it all makes sense to me I understand I'm part of him he says in the Easter seal what is the messiah what is the messiah messiah is the anointed one now if he was the Messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of God to be the Redeemer and the anointed when and God raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day you know why I read quotes because I can't say that but a prophet of God just made the bride Christ amen the Christ of this day that's what the anointed one is Christ means the anointed one you see he was the anointed one of that day his bride is the anointed one for this day she is the Christ for this day not a replacement a further manifestation same thing the woman was to Adam it's the same thing as bride is to Christ he goes this bride is the anointing one for this day it's already raised with him in the resurrection because these two are one choosing of a bride he says the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride we've been impregnated for what remember we talked last week about being made young going back to a virgin condition but we went back to a virgin condition so we could conceive seed that's what they failed to do but we conceive seed of what seed of the word to do what to reproduce the word what kind of word he tells us right here amen the word of God will bring forth the body let's start at the beginning the other is pregnant he's talking about their true church the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride do you know what the woman was in the Garden of Eden she was the finished body of Adam because Adam couldn't reproduce himself without the finished body so he's given a bride to reproduce himself because he couldn't do it without the finishing of his body and the bridegroom tree without the bride tree don't produce fruit so what does he need he needs the restoration of the Bride tree so he can produce the fruit which is the Life of Christ in the bride tree bride form amen really it's so simple it's so he tells us restoration of the Bride tree ego I mean he tells us all of these examples he tells us it's not that it's not simple it's simple to understand what's complex is how can it be me that's where the complexity enters in the self-doubt and the questionings and but I say throw that all the way forget what your head says and dive down into your soul is there something there that's screaming out it's me it's me that scream whatever it is it sounds different than anything I've ever heard before but something inside of me says I like it it resonates I don't understand it I've never heard it before but something in me is attracted to that screen bringing forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body the two together make the one body again like Adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one God is so good friends brother ma'am in future home he says now you say well look at the priest wasn't he a son of God it proved he wasn't he couldn't recognize what did he say I believe the Bible sure but he couldn't recognize the expressed word of the hour he only had an intellectual learning from some group that he had packed that had been back before him and it's the same thing today I know that's strong but it's the truth there was the word as spoken exactly for that day and and he yet he was a scholar yet he was a renowned person but he could not recognize it why no matter how scholar he was anything like that he still didn't have representation of predestination only the predestinated will only be the one who does it only can be and you can only do it because look it proves predestination because if you've got eternal life you had to be part of God all times because he's the only one is eternal what could that priest not recognize he could recognize the law of Moses he could recognize the Ten Commandments he could recognize Temple worship is that true he could recognize all the word that went before him but he recognized it on an intellectual learning level not on a revelation level because if he understood it on a revelation level when the manifestation of the Revelation came before his eyes he would recognize these two are the same but to him they were very different things say God help us that the manifestation of the Revelation in this hour will match a revelation we have in the scripture and they won't look like two different things to us that the scriptures and this revelation of the Bride coming of Christ don't look like two separate events but may God give us ice out to where they come together and we can see him as the same thing this is the manifestation of the Revelation the mystery that was hidden in Christ all that God was he poured in Christ all that Christ was born in the church so where is he he's in Bride form the headship is returned to the body and has been pregnated by the word for this hour and is manifesting what the finished body of Jesus Christ to finish the body you have to have all the members then all the members have to come attached to the headship so the headship can control every member and that'll finish his body praise God now I just want to look at one more thing as we wind down let's go to Ephesians chapter 4. Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. Ephesians 4 and 11. and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ what did he give Ministry gifts for the perfecting of the saints that word perfecting we've mentioned it before but it doesn't mean flawlessness it means full maturity or completion for the maturing of the Saints or the completion of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying that means building of the body of Christ what's the minister supposed to do build the body of Christ help the saints come to completion to maturity in verse 13 till we all come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ what are we supposed to be doing we're supposed to be bringing about the fullness of Christ where in the church in the people that's what we're here for Amy Amen brother Ben says in Christ The Mystery of God reveal now there is only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there's nothing else can follow him and now the ecumenical world has set up such a regime there can be no denomination no nothing else follow him you're either in it or you're not in it the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she is ripening into christ-like Fruit bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him what are we doing now hey the bridegroom tree and the bride tree have United are there individuals who still need to unite yes I believe that but the bridegroom tree in the bride tree of United the Sun is up amen do we believe that and the light is shining on the top and the fruit is ripening what are we doing we're in a ripening face coming to completion that means we should still be growing and christ-like sweetness and mellowness with the same spirit that he had in him he goes on to say it this way in the message Christ is revealed in his own word the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you see making matured Christians see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of Christian for him to receive the wheat has got to get ripe so he talks about the bride true and the free fruit at the top and the light then he talks about the hot augustand the rising of the Sun the the full power of the sun here to ripen the wheat bring to maturity they both are telling the same story two different parables then he goes and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says now he's Sanctified with the spirit and blood of church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now see he could go back and pick up what those other fellows has left off in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mysteries of the Seven Seals see he's expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in Christ then Express itself through the church and the same thing Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them so how are we becoming the word by surrendering to the word and letting the word go through us an identification of Christ in all ages he says this heavenly father we are grateful to see the Risen Messiah 1900 years of all kinds of Theology and movements but still in the darkness of all of it you promised that you would he appear here in the last days in this Sodom day and you would make yourself known to the children of Abraham the called the elected and here you are tonight after 1900 years you're just as much alive tonight as you was when you walk talk to the woman at the well it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the same self flesh these two are one and the church I want you to hear this now and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word in the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign God identifying himself the word in the church these last several examples is what I want us to take home with us that God through these Parables he tried to break the Amnesia open our eyes get us to have an identity to know who we really are to break us away from a false identity and bring us to a true I didn't to restore us back to who we were before Amnesia kingdom yes but then he begins to explain in different ways what we should be doing now now the grain the shuck is pulling away what does the grain need to do lay in the presence of this word amen and bake all the immaturity out till we become mature Christians what does the bride tree need to do the fruit needs to stay in the top of the tree and let the light of the word bring the full maturity of the fruit to the same sweetness and melowness that Christ had how do we become the word we become the word by letting the word you know what we're the word but we're still becoming the word amen the bride is the word but on an individual level we are still maturing the variety as a whole is still maturing we're still becoming the word by letting the word flow through us amen and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word and the word in the church becomes the same what am I doing why am I coming to church why are we doing all this because we're still baking we're still ripening we're still becoming the word word by word how does the bride go up word by word that's why we come back to hear a sermon again come back to have things exposed in our lives come back to have truths re reaffirm to us so that we can surrender a little more and lay ourselves down a little more and lay in the presence of the word a little more until we become in the stature of a perfect man can we all come into Christ the head which is Christ God bless you let's all stand let's all stand this message is my life amen amen without it where would we be without this Revelation without this understanding where would we be what confusion will be stuck in what effort would be putting forth what what kind of Christian life would be trying to live right how depressed how tired how exhausted how legalistic how liberal how how lost how what would we be oh I thank God amen I pray God will help us keep it pure keep it right keep it true to what the prophet brought I'm just praying daily that God will wash every other understanding out of me yes and let me have the true revelation of the word Matthew 5 14 says ye are the light of the world I known that statement since I was a little boy that was probably one of my Sunday school verses and I would quote it you are the light of the world a city said on the hill cannot be hid I probably quoted it and got a sticker for it but not even the impact of what Jesus is saying because if you go back to John 1 1. John 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God in him was life and that life was the light of men and John 1 1 is all about the light which is the word which is Christ coming into the world into the darkness and the Darkness not perceiving it but he was that life and as many as would receive and would receive the light of life amen so Jesus Christ the word is the light and he's standing up and he says I am the light of the world he may come to me shall not abide in darkness he was the line but now he's looking at his disciples saying ye are the light of the world what's he doing he's putting them right back in John chapter one yeah right right it's a Sunday school verse I memorized it I read it it was neat you're the light of the world we're all a light shine the light what light what light are we are we a man-made light an incandescent bulb what kind of light it's got to be original light which is the word which contains the thought which goes all the way back to the mind of God it was expressed as the word and as John 1 and he took the disciples and put them right back with him before the beginning are you the light of the world what light what kind of light is it true light is it the life that's the light of men is it the light that comes from the word is it the illumination of the mystery that was in the back part of God's mind the True Light that was to come and Shine the Light to dispel all of the myths that's been down through thousands of years it is the light and you are that light and you're to shine that light this isn't a secondary light this isn't a man-made life this is part of the original light you see how the simplest of scriptures has opened wide open in this message yeah the Bible says we look through a glass Darkly see we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come true brother comes to that scripture he says and we do by God's grace have today the perfect interpretation of where with Divine vindication he took it right to that scripture and then Paul goes on and he says but we look through a glass Darkness but then when when that which is perfect amen then we will see face to face this Bible is a mirror brother Branham taught it the nominations teaching I heard it when I was a boy but if the mirror is dark clouded obscure opaque you don't really and what always struck me with this I know I've taught it before but I can't help it right yes when you look at a mirror what do you see I mean I just love the scripture when you look at a mirror you're looking for yourself if you look in a mirror Darkly you can't clearly see yourself but when that which is perfect has come back now we see their glasses but then we will see us face to face we will see who we really are ye are the light of the world it's not a memory verse it's a reality it didn't start when you were born it didn't start when you heard the message it started when you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world that's when that verse started for you you are the light of the word because you are the word and the word is the life and the light of man that's why the bride has the power to impart life because she has the word that brings life you are the light of the world amen we're just going to stop praise God let's just sing something I gotta stop let's see amen sing something will o glorious victory that day he set me free and he made my heart foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] do I heard of heart s destination [Laughter] of who I am on Calvary die his last
