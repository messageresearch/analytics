come in the presence of the Lord and the Saints are singing and the worship is just right all that nervousness drops away so I appreciate the wonderful worship that was here this evening and I really feel welcome among you so we like to greet you in the precious name of our Lord and just want to give thanks again to those who uh um have accommodated us and we in in in my travels I've just uh been at brother Eugene a few weekends ago and been acquainted with him for the first time as most of you would know that's a unique experience uh such a wonderful man of God I'm so thankful that we are so different God has people amen and I met the wonderful Saints there in in Edmonton they just amazing amazing U people I met brother John danar again after a long time from Toronto once again just phenomenal to be with the Saints and then I came over to brother Dan I think he's brother Dan and his the people in in uh Detroit and again just amazing Fellowship uh just bless my soul to know that God has just these attributes of of his just all over the place and when we come together it's like we've known each other forever so it means so much to me and I just want to say uh I didn't plan to come here I was I was supposed to be at brother Eugene in May because brother brother Chad invit invited me and brother Eugene invited me in May and the Canadian visa didn't come through until I came here so I was just trying to honor brother Eugene's invite and and he said well you know October that's that's when we're having these meeting so please come and I actually tried sheepishly to message brother Chad and say you know I just don't want to be too long away from home I just drop in at brother Eugene and he said not a chance you are not coming 10,000 mil across the ocean and without stepping in so so but so I really uh appreciate him and U your pastor has been a real blessing to us and I just want to tell you we certainly appreciate all of you uh because it is your efforts and your support to the pulpit and the ministry here that it is such a blessing to the world to the uh I mean the people in the message across the world and we it is uh much because of your sacrifice and uh your faith in the word so we really appreciate you and everything that you do all those from Brother Franco up on the top to the Musicians the song leaders and just just wonderful people I wish uh the the Saints in duban could meet you all I always tell them uh stories when I get home of the wonderful saints of God when I come here so we really appreciate you amen and um so I wanted to uh you know I had it in my heart when I came here and I was wondering what to preach I wanted to do uh Dimensions part three part four part five part six but because I've got like four other parts to it and I thought well but it was too much to just try to cram into two service and I thought I just could never do it it was playing on my mind and what to do but uh God has given me something to speak which is something uh very special to my heart and uh it's actually the second service that I preached at the beginning of my Ministry uh something that really blessed me so much and uh opened up and kind of uh channel the way for what the ministry that God has put in my heart was going to do in um you know in my life there in Durban so I want to share that with you and of course since then God has added so much more to it and uh you know his revelation of it so we really appreciate it so we're going to take um a theme for the two meetings but I'm going to give you the theme at the end of tomorrow service amen so let's begin by reading Galatians chapter 3 verse 1 and through to 29 Galatians 3: 1-29 so I'd like to um not keep you too long but I was assured that if I preach less than two hours people were going to be offended so but we're trust in the Lord amen the word of God reads like this oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before those eye before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you received you the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now perfected by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know you therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in the shall All Nations be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with Abraham yes for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is everyone that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Lord to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of Faith amen but the man that doeth them shall live in them amen Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disen knowth or addeth thereto now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after cannot disel that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise this is beautiful pay careful attention wherefore then serveth the law that means what is the purpose of the law it was added because of transgressions well that's obvious if there were no transgressions why would we need a law till but but what's the time limit till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator glory to God the law was ordained by Angels uh in the hand of a mediator now a mediator is not of one but God is one is the law then against the promises of God God forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verely righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture had concluded all under sin that the promise of faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe the last three verses but before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come we are no longer under a school Master the Lord add a blessing to his word you may be seated amen so I want to speak on this subject and for a title the bond shall not be air with the free amen and obviously taken from the seed shall not be air with the shock but the bond shall not be air with the free amen amen so this is a very crucial Revelation given here by Paul and you see I want you to um we're just going to expound it out a little a little bit before we get to the actual subject it is human nature it is in you every one of you sitting right here it is in you to desire the law because the law feels safe right because human nature desires rather to have laws within which we can live and that's what gives us this sense of security why because law is something we can keep if someone gives you rules you can keep it and you kind of have guidance right and the law is tangible we can see its effects you can see when it tells you what to do and and if we don't do it there's a transgression and then there's a punishment for it so it's kind of something we can understand we see its effects we judge its results uh you can tell by as long as you have law you can tell when someone is a transgressor whether they transgress a little bit a little bit more more than anyone else right you can see its effects and with the law there is no guessing it tells you this particular offense is wrong it tells you that particular offence is wrong this this one here shouldn't be done or this should be left this law should be left for these Elders or that should be for the children it's very defining amen and uh there's no guessing with it either you are keeping it or you are not right Revelation is too scary for a church because nobody perceives things the same way so any good church like you fails to agree on every one point right the law makes things easier it's it's like when they came to Christ and they said just tell us if you are him like we're tired of asking you so many questions in different ways why not just tell us come out and tell us are you him or they do the same thing to John the Baptist and you never answer them the way they wanted right he even tells them if I tell you you won't even believe me yeah right but the law makes things easier or so it seems and if you can give everyone an agreed rule then we can judge it correctly see while you're sitting here you love the open book you love the word of God and yet in your heart you would think how nice it would be if all the churches in the message could just believe the same thing it would be so great no matter how much you know about the open book you still feel that inside wouldn't it be nice if we all had the same thing to believe if we all saw things the same way amen you know when I know you're a church that is well taught you love the word of God you love the open book and but that's why I believe I can speak this to you today because we can speak subjects that we cannot speak to other people we can take subjects and and and make it uh uh make us look deep into our intentions our desire past Church uh religion past message theology past ideology We can question our intentions We can question our desires that's what we want so the law you would agree make things easier right uh sometimes well if the law is severe it's hard for us but the fact that we know what the law says the law doesn't require Revelation and when when the law says Thou shalt not kill I mean nobody can misinterpret that right we know it and it's clear and no one can say well I was ignorant of it or I didn't understand it it's very simple so if you give everyone an agreed rule then it feels like we can judge it correctly in fact very often we expect a church to all do the same thing abide by cood and all keep it the exactly the same way amen the proof that the proof is that all of you here sitting here are dressed so differently tells you that Cod can be applied hundreds of different ways right now Paul is speaking to the Galatians here and and he's chastising them if you're reading the scripture this lengthy scripture we've read he's chastising them he's he's basically telling them uh you understand what the law is and that it was something that was leading us to something right you were he says you were once liberated by the spirit and by faith why are you Desiring to go back to the law see it's human nature when they have received a little Revelation uh and start to feel good about themselves then they want want to fall back to law yeah because suddenly we feel more confident in keeping the law are you hearing me so when you get stronger in Revelation you get stronger and and and and more confident and now you feel well I think I know this dressing perfectly I I can keep Church order better I can correct others with more maturity so you start falling back to the law even the you getting stronger in Revelation it's human nature to want to get more control right and that's a problem yeah the result was we brought ourselves into bondage and back when you do that instead of living by Revelation and Faith towards God when you Resort back to law you take yourself under bondage again and like Paul says under the curse of the law yeah what is the curse of the law that if you transgress according to the law you deserve the punishment the curse of the law was condemnation which brings a Believer into bondage and not Liberty in the spirit it also puts a halt on the flow of Revelation so if you living by law the flow of Revelation begins to slow down amen all right so I I want to speak on the Bond woman and the free woman uh and trusting the Lord to reveal these things to us it's a it's quite a wonderful subject that we want to get to so let's go to Galatians 4 verse 21 to 31 and I want to show you what Paul is saying about the Bond woman and the free woman amen are you with us glory to God tell me he says you that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law that means do you not understand the law for it is written that Abraham had two sons and the one by a bond made that's a slave woman and the other by a free woman but he that is the son of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise amen I I don't want to take too long I hope you understand that the the the free woman was Sarah and and the Bond woman was haga so the son of Hagar is Ishmael and the son of the free woman is Isaac and Isaac was the promised son Ishmael was permissive will right verse 24 which things are an allegory an allegory in English literature is a long complicated story with an underlying meaning okay uh for these are the two covenants the one from Mount Si which gendereth to bondage he's telling you Mount Si is the law of Moses and the law of Moses puts you on a bondage which is Hagar oh my the law of Moses which puts you under bondage is Hagar verse 25 for this hagga is Mount Si this this Paul must have been making a lot of people mad this Hagar is Mount Si in Arabia and anth to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all for it is written uh Rejoice thou Barren that bearest not break forth and cry um that thou that travail us not for the desolate hath many more children that she which hath an husband beautiful verse 28 now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of Promise verse 29 but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not the children of the Bond woman but of the free amen so we're giving you a little picture so there are many things that we can draw from this the Bond woman and the free woman let's break it down for us right the Bond woman is Hagar and who is Hagar she's a slave I want you to Bear all these points because we're now going to bring it back to you right the born woman is hagga and who is she she's a slave she is a woman without a husband she was Abraham was not her husband right but she's living under a covenant of obligation right obligated yeah right number two the free woman is Sarah who is Sarah she's a married woman she does not live under obligation but under a love Covenant hagga according to Paul is Mount Si which is the law Sarah is typed to Jerusalem of above which is Faith or Revelation amen now then the next one haga who is the law produces a son and who is a son he is the evidence of the law in other words what the law produces in the same way Sarah the who is Faith produces a son and her son is the evidence of Revelation amen so law will produce according to the scripture much more children much more evidence than children of Faith amen children of the law here's the other thing will persecute children of faith you'll never find children of Faith persecuting Children of the law right number nine children of law will never be hirs with Children of Faith do you understand that they will not inherit what we inherit and the last Point Perfection of children of Faith requires one thing the church and children of law must be completely and utterly cast out amen you cannot inherit the promise until you utterly and completely cast out the Bond woman and her son yeah amen that's why it requires that we understand this amen so we are not children of the Church of the law we do not come from Mount Si and I'm not talking about about the Jews yeah we are the children of Revelation amen we are Mount Zion we come from Mount Zion the children of just men the spirits of just men made perfect amen so let's talk about the church in bondage right people think that when when people read this and they think that the children of the law is Israel and that the children of the free is the church the Christian church and that's been taught for a long time but that's not what the prophet preached brother Mar preached that the church was in bondage and so did Paul when he spoke to the Galatians then the message people came in and they said well the church is the children of the law and the message people are the free they were they thought we're speaking about denominations the message people didn't realize they would become lawkeepers too and enslave people in bondage to the law too because that's the nature of humans to take anything with law restriction code Cod and put people into bondage it's human nature to do that why is it human nature to do that because it's the nature of the flesh that's right the flesh wants rules the flesh feels safe with rules the flesh feels safe with clear direct instructions but that's not what you're required to be living by amen let's go to um a quote here from evidence of the Resurrection uh the prophet says it must be something different look this this one quote here is one among many I just read it because it was the shortest one I chose this one he says I believe God's people are in bondage I believe they're in bondage because of tradition of man this is important what do We Gather from this it's so easy for us to make traditions that make the word of God of none effect amen and then we imprison ourselves by it amen and we lose out on the blessing that we should be achieving we should be attaining amen amen let's go to proof of his resurrection and the emancipation of the proclamation has been signed you're free and you just don't know it but Faith must have a Divine resting place if you have faith in God you've got to have some Divine resting place to place it amen I love those items we sang today um the specials in South Africa we call them items I just realized I got to adjust my South African language amen was the resting place resting in the presence of the Lord resting in the word manifesting in silence was just wonderful glory to God so if you have faith in God you've come to some Divine resting place to place it and there's no better place no other Divine Way only through God's holy word and we want to let our faith rest directly upon the written word of God Amen now man in his carnal condition and his mental conceptions he always pulls himself away from God so you agree what I'm telling you is what the prophet said amen even though God gives you a divine nature he gives you Revelation man in his carnal condition and mental conceptions pulls himself away how does he do it he starts forming Traditions he starts trying to live by law he starts turning Revelation what he learns by Revelation into law that must be kept into law that must be followed by other people why because of control he wants control man feels nervous when he feels like he's losing control so he says it's been since the beginning that man longs to see the other side but he's been bound in a prison house sometimes tradition of man puts him there that they teach tradition of different forms and motives of How To Worship amen and he puts man under bondage under his tradition and that has been since the world began so it's continuing it's a constant thing it's been that way and he shut up into prison houses amen so it is in the message today with such a message that has come to set us free we see everything in these above scriptures and quotes coming to pass amongst us we see people after God has br Bren the seals open revealed it to us still trying to go back to Egypt trying to go back to Pentecost trying to go back to denominations when the prophet said organized religion why I've always been against it I've realized it is the mark of the beast prise God that's a quote so those who form Traditions have more children those who live by law have more children what does that mean bigger churches more people making it personal personal more evidences more things to be admired more things to be recognized like oh all right if we're wrong why are there more testimonies in our lives if we're wrong why are there more miracles in our lives why do we have more of the gifts why do we have more of of this and more of that well because the children of the Bond woman have more evidence but they cannot receive Children of the promise amen listen if you live by law and tradition you cannot bring Children of the promise right okay this is just the introduction to get to what we want to talk about so just stay with me the scary thing is that brother brandham says that the people who live in this condition will never make the Rapture there's very few things brother baram speaks about when he says people will never make the Rapture this is what's so scary about this if I know this I never want to live by traditions and laws I want to live by Revelation let's read restoration of the Bride tree you know the Bible says that yes sir Church natural and church spiritual and the Bible says cast out the bonds woman and her child hagga right for she will not that the child is hagga but he's he's speaking about who the bonds woman is for she will not be air with the free woman and her child see so the natural church that's going to inherit what The Binding of the sheep The Binding of the bundles go to be burned and she will not inherit or be air with the free woman amen if the Bond woman is in bondage with her organization children she will not be air with the free woman because the free woman's children is going in Rapture and the bonds woman children is going to stand in the Judgment see cast out oh my so you agree there is a church natural and a church spiritual brother ROM breaks it down further he says that the Bond woman Hagar is the church natural and the free woman is the bride the church spiritual this is actually telling us what it is yeah he says later in the same message that the children of Bond woman are tears listen don't get lost in the terminology the children of people or the children of belief or a church that lives by law are tears they're no not the real seed right and the children of the free woman are the wheat if you go on reading restoration of the Bride tree that's what he starts saying amen so if the carnal Church the children of the carnal church are the tears they will go into tribulation yes that's right they will miss the Rapture so only the wheat the spiritual Seed of Abraham the children of the free woman the spiritual church will go in the Rapture you love the Lord amen uh let's read the next one seed is not air with the Shar that's why the Rapture is different and will only be the Royal Seed of Abraham it cannot come by the natural carnal seed of the church it'll have to be the Royal seed of the word of God through Abraham the royal seed that's why the Rapture has to be first therefore there they will not be HS together they'll not be in the Rapture together I want to punch this through amen the bond shall not be air with the free that's right let's settle this you cannot serve God by law and think you going to go in the Rapture amen the carnal church will produce Children of the Lord Children of the Lord are under the curse children that are under the curse cannot go in the Rapture they will not inherit the open book with uh the children of the free amen there is absolutely he says continue reading a church natural and a church spiritual a church carnal and a church spiritual amen are you still with me amen so the struggle of the day is for the believer to break away from his tradition of serving God by caral worship and carnal intellectual Faith so you know we can we can take this and we can if I had an Evangelistic Ministry I would stand here and make you all happy and Bash the denominations and anyone else who doesn't uh accept the open book and speak against other mess churches we can do that all day and we can all be whooping and screaming but there's no point if it if it doesn't speak to us personally amen the believer you must be son of the free woman or else you cannot be in the Rapture amen you cannot inherit the promise this can be explained on so many levels which we don't want to get to but to understand all these things properly we must search the scriptures to see the enmity that started between the Bond woman and the free woman amen amen amen I love my Bible amen amen between the son of the Bond woman and the son of the free woman this simple allegory the simple example or type in the scripture tells us and breaks open a story that goes deep into our beings amen this type shows us accurately of what is happening in our day and it shows us what is happening presently and what will happen in the future according to prophecy what we're going to share with you today is exactly what is happening in us all nobody's free from this because we are flesh spirit and soul we have this problem amen let's go to seed is not air with a Shar are you with us amen paragraph 67 he that is he that do great mystery of the the God made known understands how that God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world how that he and the father were one right watch this in other words to to those of you who know the mystery of God to whom the mystery of God is made known he understands this right what are we understanding how that the great Mysteries of the fulfilling of God taking and bringing himself hisself manifested in the age of human beings in the Stream of human beings and in the company of human beings to make his word manifest in the day in the Eastern rising of the Sun and do the same thing as the sun sets in the west to make hisself manifested in a bright Church the word made manifested that means if God the mystery of God has been known made known to you you know this amen amen that God brought himself down to be in the Stream of human beings and a company of human beings from the Eastern rising of the Sun to the West amen so see it will too he that understand it that is to know that's been revealed to him to him that sent me has everlasting life and will not come into the judgment but he's passed from Death unto life so that's settled we know that God God's purpose was to bring himself down into human beings everyone with us right now if you know that that means if God wants to bring himself down into the bride into human beings then his seed is going to be in US am right and if his seed is going to be in us that means it's get something to do with that which is free God's seed is not subject to laws God's seed does not have transgressions amen it's free so this is where it becomes personal we have no excuse when we stand before the word today we must have the revelation of the word for this day amen we must see the manifestation of the word made flesh in in US in US not by the system of law but by the operation of Faith okay so you hearing me say a lot about that tonight law and faith and uh the law does this and this transgression let's make it simpler when the message was first brought to you it was taught to you as law as Thou shalt not Thou shalt Thou shalt not do not do this do not do that so what were what were the initial Elders who were bringing the message in what were they trying to do they were trying to bring some control because we came from denominational churches we were dressing terribly we didn't know how to handle worship we uh had all kinds of denominational ideas from where we came so naturally instead of preaching Revelation and allowing us to make choices and allowing us to live by Revelation they said well it's expedient to have rules the only problem is they made a Revival about the rules that's right instead of keeping teaching us that the rules is wisdom that you should just know but you need to live by Revelation amen amen and that's the problem so it is not by a system of law but by the operation of Faith now if we have the operation of Faith then we do not focus on people's failings or people's faults it becomes personal to you and me it is always more about us it's always more about me personally Lord about you it's always going to be about that all right so are you ready for this amen this is how it becomes personal your Bond woman is your carnal nature that's your intellectual faith right you just said that God's plan God's word God's promise was that he would bring himself down in us that's right but you started with a Bond woman first you started off your life serving God with a Bond woman you have to come to this and understand and admit this you're going to have to come to some stage in your life where you stand be before God and repent of the life we lived that we thought was righteous repent does not mean apologize it means to have a change of mind amen so if the your born woman is your carnal nature your intellectual Faith then that has a son that means it produces a certain life right and your son of the Bond woman is your carnal worship listen it's not it's not doing bad things it's your interpretation of submission to God yeah that's Ishmael amen you're you're not trying to do evil things you're trying to worship God by an intellectual Faith by carnality you're trying to serve God but that's ishma that's your ishma and often times we have arguments because it's our ishmael's arguing with each other because our Isaac's would never argue with each other yeah that was in his mind before the foundation of the world yeah if we could just get those Ishmael out the way carnal worship to God that brings a life of condemnation that's a part that brings you to church and makes you feel unworthy right Isaac is not going to walk around feeling unworthy am Isaac knows who he is as Son Of Promise Isaac has been to mount Mariah and knows he's a Son of God he does not feel ashamed he does not feel like a transgressor he does not feel like lesser than anyone else but ishma has a complex ishma even feels like I had the circumcision first before you amen your caral wor worship came before your worship of Revelation you were living with that guy for a long time he is the older brother amen so our free woman is the divine nature what is the divine nature the genan seed that feminine attribute of Christ that was living dormant in them for a long time that feminine attribute of Christ was Barren was not producing when you wanted it to produce you wanted it to produce the life it wasn't producing you're waiting on God but when Lord when are you going to reveal the seals to me when are you going to reveal the word to me when is this thunder ever going to make sense when is this going to come right when is the word going to reveal itself when can I have this personal relationship in the meantime let's be a good churchgoer let's be a good message believer let's try and keep the rules let's keep the rules let's keep the rules I'm telling myself I'm a good guy cuz I'm keeping the rules I'm doing well amen God told Cain if you do well and if you don't do well he doesn't say that to Sons you know if you look at sons in the Bible man those guys messed up so many times it's like there stories David a man after my own heart had the most dysfunctional family right of anyone else I mean look those kids were even killing themselves divine nature the genan seed are pure Revelation under the third pool thank you Lord that's our free woman amen and nobody wants to preach about that everybody wants to talk about the Bond woman they don't realize by trying to go back to Pentecost you're trying to resurrect the Bond woman and her son so the Divine Nature has to produce a son at the time of life in the Silence of the seven seal without Sensations by the coming of the Lord Genesis 21 right in the plains of memory amen the son of the free woman is conceived and Christ is Manifest in our flesh the word becoming visible our life of Freedom not life of condemnation you will only live a life of Freedom once that gen brings forth other than that whatever kind of church carnality you are living by is going to constantly put you in transgression and condemnation and if you keep living your life that way you will be bluffing yourself because the bond shall not be air with the free not even close so you agree there is a battle and a trial we are facing every day I feel it every day I can't tell you how many times that nervy nature that anxiety it's like I really want to kick it out but it's constantly coming up and raising its evil head I I know who I am I feel it when I pray I'm so energized and the moment I get amongst people I'm trapped again I'm walking around feeling like everyone's watching me right I just don't want to feel like that anymore and so there's this battle this trial that we must face to bring the word to manifest in our flesh and this battle is revealed in the types and shadows people who don't have a free woman don't have any trouble with this I wonder I see some of these fellas you know preaching and get on the internet and in their churches they're walking up and down and shouting it out and they can say wrong things nobody says anything they can say the most terrible things they walk out chest out you know the churches do stuff they don't even seem to have any striving inside they don't they just believe they're receiving all the blessings they claim it they walk around and you and I who are eating from the open book are the ones feeling like everyone's watching us like like we're trapped like we're feeling like like uh uh we don't have what these people have we you know we wish we could have more right and those who don't have a fre woman just don't care they don't have a struggle just walk around believing they're it there's no struggle within amen let's go to Genesis 16: 1-6 and this is the beginning of the Bond woman and the free woman let's have a look at this type now Sarah Abram's wife bear him no children and she had an handmade an egyp Ian whose name was hagga I want you to notice this this handmade is an Egyptian this is very important because we want to understand from the quotes or from the scriptures from the types what's happening with us so hegar is an Egyptian and Sarah said unto Abraham behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing in other words I'm Barren uh I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may children by her because that was a law at that time because a servant belongs to the master in this case the mistress who is the female master and uh uh everything that she has belongs to uh belongs to her whatever child that hagga would have belongs to Sarah that was the law of Master and slave the the child or and the the bondmaid and her child have no rights that was the law of slavery at that that time right so uh she says why don't you go into my handmaid and produce a child through the because look at time is going I'm getting old I can't have a baby and maybe God was talking about this we could use that law to bring in a son it may be that I may obtain children by her it may be see interpretation and Abraham hearkened to the voice of Sarah and Sarah Abraham's wife took Hagar her made the Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife by that mean his wife meaning that he might have children through her not that they were married you understand and he went in unto hagga in other words she made it legal breaking the story out she must must have made it known to the people outside obviously you're not going to keep the secret you want to explain to the other servants you want to explain to everybody else that this is something that Sarah condoned Abram's not doing this illegally or by his own uh um valtion he's doing it because Sarah has okayed it got it okay and he went in to hagga and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes amen so in other words when the Bond woman sees that she has a child she now starts despising the free woman very important and Sarah said unto Abraham my wrong be upon thee that means I have caused this to happen to you Sarah is confessing now because she's seeing this despising uh look in the eye of the Bond woman and when saw that she had uh I have given my maid unto thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised In Her Eyes the lord judge between me and thee but Abraham said unto Sarah Behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when Sarah dealt hardly with her she fled from her face all right notice what happens after this long period of barrenness of the spiritual nature now we're bringing it to you uh the spiritual system leans towards a natural system lord it's been 50 60 years in the message you know we're still struggling with the the Cod where the rules with the dos and the don'ts like the church is things are not improving like what's happening you know and the seals are open we're getting into the word we're looking at the revealing of the word and and and still you know what's the problem the church is still cold and things don't you know we've got to go back let's have another Holy Ghost meeting let's have prayer nights let's have some program that goes on what are we trying to do this is Sarah saying I'm impatient why not try through the Bond woman and then it happens and then we say what have we done my sin my wrong be upon thee right and you know when the natural produced it was increased in Pride and this is what happens can you see why it's despised you know what you just try getting behind this desk and see what a struggle it is to hold Pride down you you don't even want to be here because it's literally a Razor's Edge and I was telling brother Chad when we were coming to the service today I actually don't like preaching I prefer where you know like the book of Acts where we all sit around a table and we just share the word I'd love that but once we get to this place where the lights are on you your miked up there's people all watching you suddenly it looks like you need to produce a show right and I'm so aware of that because I want to I want to try not to be convincing You by char Prisma I want to share exactly what's in in God's what God has revealed in my heart and bring the thought without trying to be charismatically convincing because I know the danger of that that's right and yet I feel myself slipping away sometimes sometimes I'm getting excited and I want to shout and scream and and you know and then I got to rein myself in but I think that's the Holy Spirit trying to do that right so when the natural produces it increases it increases in Pride and the value of the spiritual becomes lessened what I'm telling you is if you if God gives you a gift of Prophecy or a gift of dreams and God starts showing you something do you really think you're suddenly going to or you're just going to remain your humble self do you think there's not going to be something coming up inside that where a little pride is and you start to feel a little bit more important do you really think you can just reain that in in our church you know especially and we do this with the brothers we handle it through the deacons we handle we will handle it through the through the pastor but if it's a sister who uh I'm just sharing you with why we are so careful with it if the sister has a gift of either speaking tongues or prophesy or whatever it is if it's a sister I will say to them and they know very well you run it through your husband first don't feel the Liberty to come and speak to me go through your husband first let him come and speak to me and explain to it do you know why I'm doing this because a gift needs headship I'm doing this for you to prevent you from stepping across into Pride because you run it through your husband first let him be the one to share with me brother Al this is what my wife has seen this is the dream this is the whatever it is and if you're happy with that this is going to keep that natural thing in in check because otherwise you'll start undermining your husband you'll start dominating him he'll feel like well God is showing her things and not me he's going to start doing weird things too like trying to make himself more valuable than you or be more spiritual and it's going to be tough for him and that's the same thing that happens in a church when that's that starts rising up in the flesh and the important starts coming up and it happens if you have a gift of preaching or a gift of expounding the word or you think you just know a little bit more than other people or you can see a little bit more than other people maybe in the promised land you just have a house that's in a mountain while someone else is in the plane it doesn't make any difference right but this is what the natural does to us it puts a little Spirit of pride inside and we got to understand that is natural amen that does not inherit the promises we've got to keep it in check so Sarah realizes the problem and complained to Abraham so it's like Lord how do we deal with this now I love Abraham's words uh the Bond woman is your slave you deal with it I'm not touching this are are we together you know how much I draw from this the Bor woman is the slave of the free woman why are you allowing her to affect you you deal with it amen do with her as you please in other words Abram is saying I don't care I don't care what you do with her it's your slave you deal with it what is this saying this is saying that the genan seed needs to take dominion over the Bond woman the seed the feminine attribute within your soul needs to take dominance over that Bond woman amen even if the Bond woman um produce a child first at some stage in your life that feminine attribute will start bringing forward something that overcomes that puts it under submission amen we have to realize that the natural is the servant to the spiritual not the other way around so our trial for each one of us is to to strengthen our spiritual against this carnal flesh it which it leans towards law right it's always going to lean towards law you know I love it when actually I don't I'm being sarcastic when people come and ask you you know uh we want to do this you know what what must we do uh what does what what what is right in the message for us to do and I just ask what do you want to do exactly tell me what you want to do because your intentions are important don't look for something to make it convenient for for you to do that yeah amen what does your heart tell you what do the Gen see tell you amen that's what you need to be living after not finding quotes or scriptures to make things convenient because we want the spiritual to be dominant to to be in the dominion over the natural we have to admit we have lived so long with the natural being dominant and that's what we're dealing that's why you still need to come to church if you could do this by yourself you wouldn't need to come to church you wouldn't need a pastor you wouldn't need the church that God has provided for you the fact that we are still here is that we need to do this amen let's go to genes Genesis 16:15-16 you love him Saints amen and so this was happening just when hega was pregnant right she the moment she was pregnant she was already despising the Jean seed now she Bears the Sun and hegab uh bear Abraham a son and Abraham called his son's name which hegab bear Ishmael and Abraham was four score and six years old when Hagar bear Ishmael to Abraham so all the trouble Israel would ever have in future starts here with the simple story that's right right Hagar is an Egyptian Hagar types Egypt Ishmael became the leader of Abraham's children through Cura he is known in scripture as the midianites or the ishmaelites that's right right amen and Ishmael was the father of the Arabian people and the leader of the midianites from now on Egypt and Ishmael are going to be a Scourge to the free woman right and her son right that's what the tipes tell us so the children of Israel were forever having trouble with these two Nations Egyptians and midianites God hated the children of Midian even though he had to bless them because he made a promise to Abraham I will multiply your seed yeah and Lord knows they're multiplying constantly and because Abraham uh he said to him I will bless his your children but there was the son of Promise who is Isaac who's also being blessed but all Abraham's children are being blessed according to the promise but later on the Lord hated the midianites because they were baale worshippers and they were always trying to corrupt the children of Isaac the children of Israel and no matter how much Israel tried somehow they always had the worst situations with these two Nations the Bond woman Egypt and her son the midianites yeah amen amen why are we why are we telling you this because we're telling you we're actually telling you the Bible is warning you that you are constantly going to have problems with Egypt and Midian we know it it told us amen so it's it's not a difficult thing when you come to us with a carnal problem we know who's speaking to us Egypt or Midian but when you come to us with the gene seed that's evident amen God and forget about coming to us I mean who are we when you look in the mirror every day when you approach life every day when you do things before God when you worship God you will know know when it's carnal and when it's spiritual that's right amen so I'm going to show you just going to go through the types before we bring this to a conclusion I want to show you the problems that occurred in the Bible that had to do with these two groups Egypt and Midian let's go to uh Esau Genesis 28: 8-9 and Esau seeing the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac's father in other words and Esau knowth that the daughters of Canaan did not make his father happy he's deliberately going to make his father unhappy then went Esau unto Ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalah the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son the sister of Nebo to be his wife literally wanting to make his father unhappy goes to Ishmael to find a wife yes you know how much a problem this caused this produced The Who are constant scourged to Israel as if Egypt and Israel wasn't enough now you form the which are more of that they're just growing are you seeing the children of the carnal as producing much more children than those who are of the promise and so Esau produced which means they were part ishmaelites and this was displeasing to Isaac his father and God God could even say because he knew Esau was going to do this that Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated yes right amen all right this is beautiful and this is amazing the story of Joseph who is Joseph Christ Christ The Promised word the promised son the one who wears the coat of the father right the coat of seven colors and his brothers hate him is that right and they conspire to get rid of him they throw him in a pit three days type of Calvary right amen then Judah sees Who coming that's right amen the ishmaelites the midianites amen and the midianites take him where to Egypt they sell the promised seed to the son of the Bond woman and the son of the Bond woman takes him to the born woman and makes him a slave this is literally a type telling you that the promised seed is going to be taken slave by the carnal nature but the the type also shows you that Joseph is going to come out of there and take Dominion is that right so in other words the predestinated one is placed under subjection of that which is meant to be a slave Egypt is a slave Ishmael is the son of a slave he's supposed to be in charge of them but this system brings Joseph and throws him in prison he's made a slave to a rightful slave yeah I I don't want to keep typing this to you I hope you're catching it yes sir right that means for a very long time Eugene seed is being made slave to the carnality right it's there in the types Joseph now has to fight his way out because they keep trying to make him an Egyptian they eventually dress him as an Egyptian praise the Lord are you seeing yourself they put upon Him Egyptian clothing they give him Egyptian way of life pfar pfa's wife even tries to claim him and he's going to escape he's going to run this is what is been going on in side of you for so long eventually when Israel comes to Egypt Joseph says please don't leave my remains here get me out of here remember when you leave this place do not let them bury me in this place take me to the land of promise amen prise God beautiful am let's look at Moses right so Israel become slaves to Egypt here is Isaac enslaved saved by hagga and the Bible says that Moses had an identity crisis like someone made him the son of the Bond woman that's right yeah he went floating down the river because the true Sons were in danger and he was taken in by a kind Bond woman and placed on the throne of the born people they should be slaves but they're ruling the world the mightiest Empire at the time yeah and he was brought up as an Egyptian the promised son the one who is the deliverer has been brought up having an Egyptian identity that's right yes this is what happened in the church ages we were not supposed to be ruled by Rome yeah this beautiful word of God came through Christ and the Apostles and was coming to set us free and then they took us right into to NAA and then the Christianity was hijacked by this Roman system who should have been they're the the the ruling power at the time and they they are the ones who took uh occasion and took the word of God and Enslaved the truth amen Enslaved the the the the righteous way of living they enslaved Revelation do you know um in the Dark Ages just just prior to that when Rome took over they banned preaching by types and shadows do you know that they literally banned preaching by types and shadows because some of the the Jewish um Believers were were preaching about Jonah and they were typing and they said it's too uh erratic and it's it's uh unreliable so we should not teach by types and shadows literally go and have a look at what they they teach in their uh Bible schools and yet brother bam comes out in the end and said I'm a [Applause] typologist right Moses trapped given an Egyptian identity what is happening to you what is happening to us amen this is where we come through we're sitting here in a Christian Church everything this format was created by churchianity it was created by Christian religion all that we do is created by Christian we're actually trying to to be the free son in systems created by Egypt look at the things we have to talk about what kind of music is right how must the prayer be you know uh should Church ought to be handled this way and uh uh should we dressed that way and how should we speak and our language and our marriages and how to bring up children and what Sunday school should be like and who who created all that amen we still have to go through it can you come up with any other system even the prophet did it brother maram literally brought Pentecost he said I as much as said I don't exactly agree with Pentecost but they're the closest you know that but I mean can't we come up with a better system or better way no because the free does not need systems right amen and that's why it's some this is is the reason why the prophet said I no longer call you church I call you bride so you will understand so even though we're in this I'll say it plainly church is an Egyptian system it's a Roman system everything we do and so please don't get picky about things that Egypt put on us yeah we need to move forward with the word with that which was before the world began the word of Christ that went into dingy halls and poor places and places where there was no order like Roman Theology and places where Believers were free to share what is in their heart and to live according to Revelation that's where we ought to be today Hebrews 11:24 isn't isn't this wonderful amen look at what Moses does by faith Moses when he became mature refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's Daughter by faith he refused the Egyptian identity of all things to mention I mean you could have mentioned a whole lot of other things that Moses had Faith about but this is what he his faith produced he refused his Egyptian identity he was grown up an Egyptian he was taught Egyptian Warfare he was taught Egyptian law he was placed on the throne he was wearing Egyptian clothing but when he became mature amen he forsook Egyptian identity that's where the bride of Christ ought to get to forsake Egyptian identity because that is the son of the carnal nature that is the worship of carnality we have to come to a place where the bride is dominant the Gen is dominant and the worship that comes from us is the son of that which should be dominant the son of the genan seed praise be to God and in coming to maturity he refuses to be called the son of the Bond woman though being a slave to the Bond woman he had to I love that story I love the story of Moses how he was tussling with he was shown who he is you're the son of Hebrew slaves can you imagine a turmoil I have to forsake a palace for a slave house I've got to forsake good clothes a nice bath a good job people that respect me and come to a place where I even save this guy from another Egyptian and and he says who made you a prince over us you mean I'm going to give up this for that yes amen there's far more recognition if we go back to Pentecost isn't it there's far more recognition if I can keep the law better than someone else isn't it oh yeah if I can have a gift like those guys if I can have more recognition more or better pulpits or more people uh lording my name or more people shouting about respecting me that's that's a lot better than this humility what's with this humility so when he kills an Egyptian it was Sy because after that he escapes right and he escapes the Bond woman praise be to God hallelujah and then where does he land first now when Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay Moses but Moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian and he sat down by a well out of the pot into the fire it's like you just kind of escape this thing he will leave the Bond woman and go and find the bond woman's son right merrily in the desert surrounding the Holy Mountain that's right amen unbelievable amen so he settled down and forgot his purpose there's a quote in the message where the Prophet said God searching for Moses dramatizing it and he says he found him merrily walking around the mountain with his little wife and his children and his sheep living at ease brother B says God found him in this condition that doesn't sound like a bad condition that sounds like good family life you know wife his little children pretty little wife around the mountain of God he's got a job and brother Ram said God found him in this condition yes living amongst the bond woman's son right and he married the daughter of a priest of Midian that's right you see how fast we get trapped we just Escape Pentecost we come off and we go straight to the son of the born woman and he goes back to Egypt now he he meets God he's been hanging around the mountain 40 years living his life of ease and then God has to bring a pillar of fire to get his attention and then he questions God have you not heard the cries of my people and you know what he does because this is what happens to uh traditional Believers he goes to Egypt he saves his people and where does he bring them back to Jethro his father-in-law right and that was his first major mistake because Jethro taught him denominationalism what do you remember Jethro tells him you know what uh as a priest of Midian as someone very well versed in the law as someone who studied for a long time and has a degree in this I can tell you that you are taking too much on yourself it looks a little smacks of self-importance you know I know you've had some some powerful first and second po Ministries but you know this is not the way to go you need to elect 70 men you know who can handle things for you need to create a system whereby you can control the people that's what the son of the Bond woman teaches it was denominational advice and that just LED Moses to more trouble because once he gave these other men importance he started circumventing what he was supposed to do and he realized he and his people had to leave Midian he had to separate from his father-in-law and move them to the promised land because they were sitting around there enjoying this and they were not getting to the promise amen glory to God all right so the midianites when they walked through the Wilderness uh God forbad them to marry the midianites is that right so when the children of Israel committed whoredoms with Moab God killed 24 4,000 yes Israelites by a plague right and the high priest's son finaz saw an Israelite who took a Midian itish woman into his tent to take to wife and finaz went in and thrust them both with a javelin and God stopped the curse God was happy that they killed a midan itish woman and sto this marriage between Israel and Midian yeah God stopped the curse God was pleased because of that and stopped the curse why it's it's just On and On Through the Bible right let's go to C is not air with the Shar paragraph 72 you love the Lord Saints amen the stalk hagga two wives doubted the promise but watch what that brought forth when hagga the second wife of Abram which was just an ABS absolutely a concubine wife I like the fact that brother maram makes that clear but she brought forth a man but what kind of man was he the Bible said he was a wild man yes sir he lived by his bow and no man would conquer him he was untameable unconvertible unregenerated amen you want to go back to that the prophet said a wild man ishmail is a wild man the the worship that you will produce from a carnal nature is a wild man he's untameable unconvertible unregenerated do not get trapped in them saying they can take you back to that he could not be tamed he was a wild man because he was of the contrary to God's word and anything that's contrary listen any preacher any member any church that's contrary to God's word will bring forth a wild adulterous bunch of worldly Hollywood and cannot stay with the unadulterated word because it's not even included in the promise that's if that isn't a warning to us if we ever try to go to organized religion and her son what's going to happen a wild man A Wild Worship untameable unconvertible unregenerated contrary to God's word you believe that Saints amen because it's not it cannot attain it cannot stay with the unadulterated word because it's not even included in the promise oh my okay that proves that a life under the Bond woman or the the church that's trying to live under law will bring forth a life that is untameable young people I know I know what it's like I walked that walk I was in the message when it was being taught that way and we've got to come to the maturity that's not what we're asking of you today that's not what's being asked of us we're actually telling you uh I was speaking about this in uh brother Dan's Church a caged animal is the most ferocious a caged animal is the most untameable he's he's damaged he's lost his mind he's unable to be free he's unable and then you let him out of his cage and he's going to bite everything he's just wild he's the wildest creature you can ever get is a is a cage animal so if you take the message and you teach it like a bunch of law laws and standards and regulations and oppression what do you think is going to happen to the young people what do you think is going to happen to their lives well of course they're they they're raging beast that's right amen it's unconvertible it's unregenerated you going to have to wait they they most likely will go off into the world and fall and so on and then have by the grace of God have to come back and you as a church must provide the way back if that be the case then we must see to it that we are not trying to live the life under the anointing of the Bond woman amen so Egypt we're going to be closing just now Egypt has become a prophetic spiritual condition Amen in the Book of Revelations in Prophecy Jerusalem of the present world is called Sodom and Egypt Revelations 11 amen the two prophets will come to that City they will lay in a street that City the Jerusalem which is called Sodom and Egypt right how is Jerusalem called Sodom in Egypt why it's telling you that it's going to be filled with immorality and it's going to take the people bondage yes right and it's become a present condition am amen because of its ability to put people in bondage through through traditions and forms of godliness let's read Revelations 118 quickly and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of their great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified our Lord was crucified in Jerusalem that was the city but the scripture is telling us that Jerusalem will become Sodom and Egypt this is telling you that this is possible for Holy churches yes to become immoral and slave drivers and you know when you think of the word slave drivers you you're going to think well you know they're not really that strict they're not really that bad you don't have to be a slave driver who whips the people you can be a slave driver who manipulates them psychologically that's right amen it's so easy when you teach a certain type of behavior and you whip them by making them feel less because you're more powerful in your gifts I was there in those youth meetings and those conventions where they were trying to get us to act and where there was whooping and screaming and all kinds of things and I I knew the guys were falling yeah I knew the the guys who were behaving like they were getting the Holy Ghost they were my friends and I knew they were Hypocrites amen yes amen they were not fooling me I don't know what they had but I knew it wasn't the Holy Ghost I can say that confidently without offending the Holy Ghost because I knew they didn't love the word it was a love of self it was peer pressure right and what does it produce well if it is the spirit of God it's going to lead you into a life that is going to be Conquering the spirit of evil in this flesh it's going to be Conquering the son of the Bond woman it's going to Le it but if it leads into wildness Untamed nature unconverted nature amen right amen we don't want that Jerusalem of the now becomes an Egypt for the Jews in the tribulation how much more has Church tradition and religion formed a spiritual Egypt to make slaves out of free people so any person that is ruled by any system of law religion culture listen I don't know what it's like here where I come from there's a lot of different cultures in on the continent of Africa with such a mixture of cultures and those cultures rule the the people yes sir they literally remove the the true essence of the word you were trapped by the culture you were born into tribalism like you're you're being blackmailed into respecting Elders who are not even teaching you the truth pastors who are preaching faults leaders of churches that are preaching false and you're just trapped because you are taught you have to respect them that's right and it's a culture not it's it's not even something that is of the word it is in Egypt and has them in bondage the life that they produced is just the Beast nature pretending to be a Son of God look at what happened with ishmail did you see what happened in the Bible ishmail was persecuting Isaac right he's a wild man and Ishmael may have the Holy Ghost yes sir amen he had the circumcision first at the horrible age of 13 but Israel or Isaac received the circumcision according to the proper law right when he was born so Ishmael may have gifts abilities amen strengths it may produce fruit all the time as well in fact it will produce more fruit than Isaac will but it is from a system of law religion tradition and culture it is not the predestinated life of the genan seed so what is it it's just the shark the son of the Bond woman yes glory to God let's read uh seed is not air with the shark we're almost closing you love the Lord Saints that's the way with people people who profess Christ many of them look like Christians try to act like Christians but you've got to have Christ on the inside of you which is the word made manifest or it'll never mature into a real Bible believ in Christian it'll always be a denominational something I love the way he speaks it cannot live because there's no life in it to live he's obviously not talking about denominations by their name when he means denominational he means it's something by organized religion right it'll never mature into real Bible believ in Christians always be something that comes out of organized religion amen it cannot live last quote there's only one way to be a Christian the word Christian means Christlike and you can't do it you can't work it in yourself if you're trying that's a Bond woman and that's a bond woman's son right there there's no way at all you can do it you have to forget yourself die out to yourself and let Christ come in and Live the Life of Christ in you that's a foundational thing that we as people who believe in the open book need to realize I just rest just stop fighting know that Isaac is the son of the free woman I don't want to fight with myself anymore Lord I just want you to produce that life within me I want to just feed on the word I want to get more of that word I want to immerse myself in that word I want the life to come out from that that feminine Gene seed I'm tired of fighting with churchianity and trying to prove myself to people I just want to soak myself in there I just want to live the life that you predestinated me to be I want to live without reproach I want to live without feeling like everyone's watching me that I have to perform for them that I have to do what they think is right I just want to live by the genc that is inside I want to live by that which it can produce I don't want it to be my abilities or someone else teaching me about something or asking me or forcing me to be some way I don't want to be a rule follower I don't want to be pleasing people by following rules and then because rules are always adjusting amen right and you can just never attain just when you follow a rule they increase something or adjust something or change something and then we're going on for decades and decades and no one's getting it right I want to be what you want me to be let us realize we cannot do this by our strength of our own human character that is so affected by pride and arrogance I can't tell you how much this means to me how much it helps me because I I I know when I when I assess myself every single day I know when it's my ability when when I'm trying to do something where I'm trying to circumvent the word in some way where I'm trying to say something or do something for some kind of attention or to be right about something or to be more right than someone else you just know that Holy Spirit checks you in there and you know it's not about you it's not about the flesh it's not about recognition it's about what God wants it's about his purpose for me for today amen we must have his life come alive in us when we can produce this predestinated life we cannot go in the Rapture with our Bond woman produced life we have to have the revelation of the free woman and live in that that is our hope that is our stay that is our solid rock that is our part in the Rapture the bond shall not be air with the free amen praise be to God let's bow our heads together Hallelujah as the musicians come up brother Chad we'll bring this to a close amen praise be to God don't you love him Saints let's bow our heads Heavenly Father how wonderful you are to us Lord wonderful in your all your ways this has been something that the scriptures openly spoke to us about and the trials therein of all those sons of God who had to deal with this Bond woman and her son and it all started because the free woman allowed it to happen but we know Lord that your word tells us that we were trapped into this body that's and this body was the part that started first that started enjoying the presence of the Lord and started creating rules and revivals of all kind and started enjoying what it was feeling and took dominion over us we see it in our personal lives we see it in the growth of the message church we see it in the history of the Christian church but Lord we believe you have chosen us you have chosen and predestinated us unto that adoption of sons that maturity by which the same as Moses by faith we refuse to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter that's right we refuse we reject that Egyptian identity we reject that Bond woman and her son Lord we pray for this your church these your people for all of us Lord The church here the church back home the Believers who are the bride of Christ we believe this Rapture cannot take place until we completely and utterly cast out the Bond woman and her son because the bond cannot be air with the free Lord I pray that this may become a a realization to us a revelation to us above everything else Lord we we love that you have opened those Seven Seals we love that you have revealed the Mysteries to us we love the open book we love the Fellowship of the word father but every time we leave this spiritual anointing we go back into the carnality of life back to our homes back to our families and we want to be as real as we can be we're tired of living by the rules and the laws of religion we're tired of the fear of wanting to be safe wanting to be secure by rules that can protect us by rules that can guide us and give us control in our lives we want to be free we want to be set free and live by the Revelation that you put in our hearts make it real Lord we pray for every person for every husband every wife every child every youth Lord for all of us officers in the church and preachers and pastors Lord we want to be set free we want to live by revelations we want to tell the truth we want to have integrity we want to live by Honor and we know it can only happen if we let that genan seed become the dominant amen Lord let it be so we pray we ask it all now in your precious and wonderful name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and

old carnal nature remove it from me Lord it can't be air with this manifestation that you want to come forth this manifestation has to be real genuine true the word Made Alive amen God bless you so

why we crave it so bad so thankful for the word today and let's just bow our heads and thank him for this word dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for feeding us on your word thank you for opening our eyes and taking your word and pulling back the scales for your Prophet told us that the isav is the word God and you're removing the film that has blinded us Lord so that we can see clearly in this day what it is you're trying to do and what you've called us to you've called us to Freedom Lord and we find out the bondage Lord the bondage is not outside of me the bondage is not another human being or somebody else the bondage is not even a denomination Lord the bondage is this old carnal nature that's where I want to be free from Lord that I'm I'm not fighting other men I'm not fighting even systems of man I'm fighting the the old nature that wants to make another system God help this real life on the inside come forth God separate and remove this old nature from me cast it out I pray as Sarah cried out to Abraham cast out the Bond woman and the son of the Bond woman for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with to free God our hearts are crying the same thing Lord
