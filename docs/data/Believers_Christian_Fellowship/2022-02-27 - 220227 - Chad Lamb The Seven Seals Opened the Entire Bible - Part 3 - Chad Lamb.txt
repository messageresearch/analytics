genesis chapter one we'll begin there i'd like to just um you know mention we all know what's going on on the world stage and how things are moving right along with prophecy amen and then when brother benham told us to watch russia watch the king of the north you can see russia's rising and when you look at end time prophecy russia is when you get to the very end they're the dominant force on the earth and you can see russia rising but i just want you to remember our brothers and sisters in ukraine because i can't imagine what the situation is like for them as we're gathered here to worship together and enjoy the presence of the lord together i'm sure they're not able to this morning in most all of ukraine uh if not all of it so just remember them as you pray just remember the uh ilie and natasha's family i'm sure they're concerned for their family and with having them in the assembly it hits even closer to home you know so let's just join forces together and let's just pray together really quick for our brothers and sisters before we move on let's bow our hands lord jesus we have a special request lord as we're standing with the privilege you've given us to gather this morning and the freedom and the peace lord to come and hear your word to sing praises to your name lord our brothers across the planet they don't have that same privilege this morning our brothers and

appreciate it we would just remember that need also i want to remind you that brother samuel wallach from poland will be here on wednesday so be praying for that service and i'm sure traveling out of the country might have been hard for him i don't know what it's like poland being a neighbor there to ukraine and under tension as well so just pray for him while he's out of the country and pray for his family amen the world is changing it's hard to see but for you and i it's a good thing because everything is moving rapidly to the final destination and where god is restoring he's bringing back all that was lost i mean all these things must needs be so we praise god that there's been a prophet in the land in our day to tell us these things to show us through the scriptures so that our hearts don't fear that we look at this and say this is what was told us these are the things we've been prepared for this hour these are the things that the lord has revealed to us amen and they have to be this way and we thank god that we have a promise for this hour man while we're standing let's read genesis chapter 1 verse 1. genesis chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth let's go to john the gospel of john john chapter 1. john chapter 1 and we'll read verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god now let's turn to revelation chapter one revelation chapter 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signify it by his angel unto his servant john man may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word as you're seated amen franco if you could bring up that first life for me on the powerpoint i'd like to go to one more scripture before i get into the powerpoint if we can go to colossians chapter one these are scriptures we've been looking at for the last uh two weeks or more and i want to look at colossians chapter 1 and i'm going to begin reading in verse 15. who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell we've been looking at this uh subject for a few services now the seven seals opened the entire bible and we were we we went back the first time when we established the truth that brother branham brought to us out of the scriptures that jesus christ is the word of god amen he is the word and and when god was alone with his thinking god was with his thoughts and when he wanted to express those thoughts he expressed them in the word and brother branham says that's when the logos came forth or the expression of the thought of god and brother branham describes it he says i can see it like a little uh light amen like a little light coming forth and what is that that's the expression that's the that is the uh i would say the the first tangible expression that's that is explained to us of the expression of the thought of god and in that that came from the father amen was the son and it was the word it was the word the word in in john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word that word is logos and logos is not just a word a word that's just written just a written word is the greek word rima but logos is a little different than that logos is the word with the thought or with the intent amen so it's a word that is understood that that explains or you can comprehend by that word the thinking amen so it's a word that's an expression of the thinking and so now from the father comes amen the the logos or the word amen and brother branham tells us when when you read amen your bible if you don't see christ in every line go back and read it again for it's all christ amen and he said all the way back in the beginning when it says in the beginning god created he said there's christ right there and then we come to colossians and we find out that absolutely in the beginning he created what did he create by he created by the word we know that by the word of god the worlds were framed we know the worlds were framed by the word of god so god made all things by him and for him and without him nothing was made that was made so christ amen amen is the word of god the thought of god expressed coming into manifestation amen is christ and christ amen is a reflection or a manifestation of the father of god amen so we're gonna we're reviewing these things but we want to build on top of them because they have everything to do with you and i and everything to do with the day that we're living in and the manifestation of this moment in time amen there's a manifestation of god that is taking place on the earth in this moment and you and i have everything to do with that expression of god and we must understand these things as the prophet brought them to us because they were brought to us for a reason amen they were brought to bring us faith to take away amen the the mystery that has been enshrouding our existence and the church and the church ages and all down through the bible amen at the end time god has come with a revelation to peel back the mystery of the entire bible to give us a faith like like human beings have not had before amen a faith that will absolutely reverse the curse amen that came upon us in the garden of eden how did that curse come by leaving the word amen so what mechanism will god use to bring us out of that curse he'll restore the word amen and the restoration of the word will bring us out of that curse and souls that are in prison now says the mystery was in the seven seals when these seven seals was open that opened up the entire bible the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and in these seven seals held the entire mystery of it this is where i this is where i got my text from as i said two services back and i was looking at this and saying when the seven seals was open that opened up the entire bible and i've just been praying and meditating and said god i want to understand that better i want to understand that statement that the prophet made better that when he opened the the mystery was in the seven seals when the seven seals was opened that opened up the entire bible because brother branham also says in the invisible union what did he do he opened up the seven seals of the last message you notice that the seven seals which all the mysteries of the seven church ages was sealed with seven seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in their days they didn't live long enough but but this blessed revelation of the seven seals it's opened to us in this last days from a prophecy that went forth to arizona so the the thing that i've been meditating on is this statement where brother bannon said the seven seals which all the mystery of the seven church ages were sealed up with the seven seals which you can see that so clearly that you know christ came and when christ came we talked about this on the road to emmaus amen he beginning at moses in all the scriptures amen revealed the scriptures pertaining to himself amen jesus christ was the fulfillment of the word of god everything that the prophets were showing foreshadowing telling us prophesying he come and he was the fulfillment of all of it he was the full word in flesh and so jesus on the road to emmaus amen and then later with the disciples behind the closed doors he is opening to them the scriptures what's he doing he's opening the word amen and when he's opening the word he's showing that this entire word was pointing to me it was showing you who i am this word was declaring this day and what moses was declaring this day amen joshua was declaring and jesus is standing there as the fulfillment peeling back the seals of the old testament saying it was me moses was showing forth me joseph was showing forth me right we see that and so he opened unto them the scriptures and then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures but then out of christ amen the prophet tells us comes a chunk amen comes a peace amen and what is he doing now he's making the new testament and brother ben tells us here in the invisible union that when we get to the end of the new testament amen now we know that the those church ages have been sealed with seven seals and the seven seals amen the the mystery of the seven church ages was sealed with seven seals and when you look at the seven seals you can so easily see that the revelation of the seven seals unlocked the mystery of the church ages is that right the anointing the antichrist anointing the christ anointing coming through the church ages amen all of that how god redeemed from the time of christ on what the book of redemption looked like from christ's time on amen is all revealed in the seven seals so i could see that but brother branham said the seven seals opened it opened the entire bible amen the entire bible not just the church ages not just the new testament but it opened the entire bible and that's what i've been meditating on saying god let me see that more clearly amen how did the revelation of the christ anointings for the last 2000 years unlocked the entire bible how did understanding a white horse a a red horse how did it unlock the entire bible god what are you well i don't want to just read something and read over it i don't want to just say something and say it but i want a revelation of why the prophet said it this way when you can look at the seals and see that it unlocks the new testament it reveals the uh the mystery through the church ages absolutely but brother branham said it did more than that it unlocked the entire bible and i want to know that amen he says now he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals that means the seals are more than just information amen the seals are more than just data it's not just downloaded data and facts and figures the seals are more than that friends when you open those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ praise be to god then the opening of the seals for us has to be revealing christ amen it's got to be unlocking christ unveiling the mystery he says in revelation 10 1-7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now brother brennam goes to this scripture and he ties revelation 10 1-7 the mighty angel coming down the seven thunders the sealing up of the thunders and and then revelation 10 7 here the mystery of god being finished in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he ties all of that to malachi 4 and he puts them together and we know that he comes to fulfillment of malachi 4. he was the seventh church age messenger he is the seventh angel he is the seventh messenger and in the days of his voice the mystery of god should be finished and at the opening of the seals amen the revelation was given forth that would finish the mystery of god and that mystery of god has been laying in the entire bible because the entire bible is christ and christ is a revelation of god so the entire bible is the revelation of god through christ christ is the word or the manifested thought of god all right so i think by now by the teaching that brother branham has given us we've been able to break away from denominational views of christ to where every time we see christ the only thing that we can imagine is that the the manifestation 2000 years ago when it was all bottled up in the body of flesh amen that was that was born and laid in a manger but christ amen was being expressed before the world was framed as the logos that came from the father christ has been expressed all the way down through the entire bible is christ amen is the manifestation of the thought of god the reflection or revelation of the thought of god that is all christ because the bible tells us christ was that rock that followed him through the wilderness so we know that that rock was christ all right moses when moses left egypt he esteemed the treasures of christ more than all the pleasures of egypt the reproach of christ he esteemed it greater bearing the reproach of christ and all of the treasure all of the pleasures that are in egypt so it means christ was being made manifest back then and christ we'll get on here and brother ben says now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire bible this is so critical that we we begin to take what the prophet said and just pray god let it sink so deep into my soul that it becomes a living reality a revelation not terminology amen not something i nod my head and say yes to again and again but this becomes a living reality inside of me that i i know what that prophet was talking about he's basing his text upon the entire bible but what i want to title this is christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god revealed what is the whole bible christ he's the mystery of god that is being revealed and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of god should be finished now he says now in saint john the first chapter don't forget it in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was meant made flesh and dwelt among us hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever and this book is a revelation of jesus christ all the way from genesis to the last book of revelation it's the revelation of jesus christ the prophets and all those things were foreshadowing christ and everything in the book is jesus christ and so now we know that he is the word and the weeds the word made manifest for the day and season for the age in which it's meant to be made manifest making him the same yesterday today and forever so it's the same and that he is the word made manifest not the exact same actions or else in order for him to be the same we'd have to be coming out of egypt again and coming out of egypt again and coming out of egypt again you understand he's the same yesterday today and forever not amen not the expression has to repeat but he is the same that he is the word being expressed the manifestation of the word for that day makes him the same what was he in moses day the manifestation of the word what was he in joshua's day the manifestation of the word what was he in solomon's day the manifestation of the word what was he amen in our day the manifestation of the word making him jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he is the word now he says the bible is not a book of systems let's catch this this is what tears down denominational understanding the bible is not a book of systems no sir it is not a book of systems nor a code of morals the bible is not a book of systems so many systems and so forth no sir it is not a book of morals no sir nor is it a book of history altogether or neither is it a book of theology it is the revelation of jesus christ that's why i said before we've been reading the bible for thousands of years but not seeing the bible amen reading but not seeing getting the details but not understanding the mystery amen seeing the breaststrokes but never seeing the picture and then fighting over the brush strokes separating over the brush strokes starting new divisions over portions that we see amen but what is it that tears down divisions what is it that crushes denominationalism when you can fly on eagle's wings a little bit higher and see the whole revelation from genesis to revelation and then all of a sudden you realize amen it's not the details that i'm fighting over the details are painting the picture it's the picture i need to see amen and so this bible is not a book of morals boy that really shocks some people neither it is a book of theology that's not the purpose of the written word and now the morality of god is contained in there the theology of god is contained the doctrine of god is contained in there but that's not why he gave us this word he gave us this word to manifest himself so that we would see him it is the revelation of jesus christ so you see how the bible can be so easily misused because it's not being used to manifest christ or reveal christ it's only being used to create another division it's being used to create another religious sect another form of theology another moral code another system and when the bible is used for that the bible is being misused because the scriptures are here to declare christ and christ is declaring god now he says all those things typed him just in time but yet the mystery was hid them men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do some now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation but expressing it expressing himself in moses and david joseph elijah and on down through and we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show it expressed jesus christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret in full waiting for to make it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it if he told the whole thing praise be to god the whole bible was expressing the mystery giving it out in portions and shadows and in times it was expressing the mystery and expressing the mystery but holding back the great revelation of it because the great revelation of it was going to be sealed and the last book of the bible sealed under seven seals and it was going to be shadowed and typed and shadowed and typed and spoke of and prophesied about and typed and shattered all the way through they were expressing it expressing it expressing it expressing it but holding back the great revelation of it until the last days and in the last days he would take the veil off the whole thing and show the mystery of god he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type in expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god said well you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it brother comes down to christ as the mystery of god revealed takes the entire bible amen for his text and entitles it christ is the mystery of god revealed and then does the entire bible is the is the revelation of god's mystery in christ and he tells us the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had now you can see why if we go to the bible and we can do the same thing with the message of the hour if we go to it and we start digging around in there in the details and start and start uh fixating on on details and complicating and dividing and and arguing and and creating new doctrines and new movements and all of these things we it shows right there we've missed the whole thing because it wasn't given for that purpose this revelation in the end time is to show us the mystery of the entire bible and the mystery of the time bible is christ and christ is the mystery of god that's being revealed so it's all about revealing god and in the last days he has revealed it brother man says he has revealed it and shows it and he was preaching christ as the mystery of god revealed hoping that you'll see it right here this morning and how many guilt were guilty of not seeing it right then but by god's grace he's constantly unfolding the mystery to you and i as individuals so we can see more clearly what this whole thing is all about and who it is that we love it says the book of revelation is the last book of the bible it's sealed to unbelievers in there the bible says in the 22nd chapter whosoever shall take one word from it or add one word to it it'll take his part from the book of life we realize that it was all together given for believers and it opens the book of revelations and reveals who the author of the entire book is he is the look upon his alpha and omega from genesis to revelations jesus christ just the same right straight through and reveals his complete mystery of himself and his plan for his church ages that is to come and was sealed in there by seven seals so now brother benham is specifically talking about the last book of the bible the book of revelation and he says that book of revelation amen is sealed to unbelievers amen that book is sealed to unbelievers and he says it is it reveals the complete mystery of himself so the book of revelation is to reveal the complete mystery of jesus christ hold that in your mind he goes on to say and now remember the word always comes to a prophet we all know that god does nothing without showing it to his prophets that's the reason the book of revelation of jesus christ is the full fullness of christ right here before us the book so now brother branham says that your entire bible is the revelation of jesus christ and then he'll go to the last book just oh just about that much and he'll say that is the complete revelation of jesus christ praise be to god these are why we meditate these are why we ponder this is why we go back to the message this is why god sent a prophet is our day because brother ben said all of these things for a reason and everything he said carries great weight and brings a great revelation of god the entire bible is the revelation of jesus christ the book of revelation is the complete revelation of himself now let's look at this let's go to revelation chapter one together the revelation genesis revelation 1 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him to show unto his servants things much which must shortly come to pass so this book is the revelation of jesus christ right from the beginning he's telling you what the entire book is about it is the revelation of jesus christ and it was given to christ and given from christ to a servant to be given to an angel to give to his servants but if we look at this uh word revelation in the bible it's apocalypses it's interpreted revelation manifestation coming appearing these are all the times it's used in the new testament it's used in those words but if you get to the definition there in part part one of the definitions it says a laying bear a making naked a disclosure of truth instruction concerning things before unknown and then down the part that i have an orange it says used of events by which things or states or persons hitherto withdrawn from view are made visible to all manifestation and appearance so this is the revelation of jesus christ this last book of the bible which is the capping off of the entire bible which is the capstone book of the entire bible that book is the revelation of jesus christ and that word apocalypse means events by which things or states or persons hitherto withdrawn from view are made visible to all manifestation and appearance so what is this revelation of jesus christ going to do it is going to open your eyes to something that's been previously out of view there's been a person that's been out of view there's been a person that's been unseen his appearance has not been recognized amen through the church ages and that appearance is going to be unveiled amen in the book of revelation now it is the unveiling it is the unmasking amen it is it is the opening the manifestation of jesus christ what the book of revelation is so the book of revelation this prophecy that he's laying down is going to become his the revelation of himself what is it something that's been previously out of sight not that he wasn't there but been out of sight amen not not made known not declared but now that thing that's been there but undeclared is going to be declared and what will declare it this end time book which is sealed to unbelievers and sealed by seven seals when the seven seals comes on it unlocks that book when it unlocks that book and unlocks the entire bible and what does it unlock the revelation of jesus christ what had been previously unseen is now appearing out of the church age book he says the scribe not author of this book is saint john the divine historians agree that he lived the last part of his life in ephesus though at the time of the writing of this book he was on the isle of patmos it is not the life story of john but it is the revelation of jesus christ in the future church ages in verse 3 it is called a prophecy and then is actually what it is so when jesus gave this to john it was a prophecy of what was coming but what was coming amen it was his revelation of himself but a prophecy and let's look at this in chapter one let's go over to verse nine chapter 1 verse 9 right in the beginning i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ and i was in the spirit on the lord's day and i heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna unto pergamos and unto thyatira and under sardis and then to philadelphia and unto laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with the garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like in defined brass as if they burned in a furnace in his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance as the sun shineth in all of his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches now i want to look at this right out of the chute in revelations chapter 1 and revelations 1 1 this is called the revelation of jesus christ brother bam told us this is the revelation of himself and when you go to see christ being revealed in the book of revelation amen i just i'm going to say some things but stay with me on this and don't don't let your mind amen uh just listen to me okay when he when he hears a voice like a trump and he turns amen he is now seeing jesus christ in an expression but that expression he is seeing is not the man from nazareth he is seeing the man from nazareth didn't have white hair the man from nazareth didn't have a sword coming out of his mouth the man from nazareth didn't have feet like brass amen that the man from nazareth that wasn't that was this was jesus christ but he's represented in another form and another expression and another manifestation it's the same jesus christ but now he's revealing himself another way than what john had seen him last is that clear and now we see jesus christ and when he turns listen when he turns to see the voice that spake to him he turns to look and and it doesn't say that first he saw him the first thing he saw was seven candle sticks so the first thing he sees is seven candlesticks we'll read that here in verse 12 and i turned to see the voice that's spaking to me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst or in the middle of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man amen so if i could say it this way when he turned he heard the voice he turned we know by the description that this is christ amen this is christ he is the white wigged one he is the white raymond the face shining like the sun he is the one with the feet of brass the sword coming out of his mouth the the the white wig of supremacy this is jesus christ but when he turned to hear the voice he saw the candlesticks and in the middle of the candlesticks he saw this one that was talking to him so what is the revelation of jesus christ in the book of revelations the revelation of jesus christ in the book of revelations is not the manifestation of the baby in the manger it is the manifestation of jesus christ in the middle of his church the revelation in the book of revelations is the revelation of jesus christ coming forth in bride form that's the book of revelations it's not going back and saying he was born in bethlehem he was in a manger we saw his star that manifestation already came that was the fullness of the word made flesh but now we come to the book of revelation and he's saying the revelation of jesus christ that god gave to him and he gave unto uh sent it and signified it by an angel and to a servant john now here's another revelation or the revelation of himself but how is he going to reveal himself he's gonna reveal himself standing in the middle of seven church ages that's why when we come to the book of revelation we come to the seals when he takes the seals off the revelation the apocalypse says amen the unfolding the unveiling is something that's previously not been seen but now coming into manifestation because through the church ages we weren't seeing that this is christ coming through his body praise be to god so now we come to the revelation 1 1 sets the tone for the rest of the book of revelation and it is the revelation of jesus christ how is he manifest first he you you you see you hear the voice of a trumpet amen it's the voice of god amen you turn to see and you see seven candlesticks and then in the middle of the candlesticks is the one who's speaking he's speaking out from the candlesticks and then you go to revelation chapter two chapter three it's the church ages you go to chapter four after the church ages john a type of the bride is caught up higher to get a heavenly revelation a spiritual understanding sees that the book is open takes the book the lamb takes the book and opens the seals bringing us to revelation chapter 10 the seven thunders and when we come to the time that the seventh angels on earth the mystery of god to be finished the the seven thunders will now uh be revealed when they're revealed it looks back amen and explains redemption through the last two thousand years which is what christ coming in pride form so the revelation of jesus christ in the book of revelation is christ in the midst of the seven candlesticks so the book of revelation it's not it's not rehearsing again the previous manifestation it's a prophecy showing from that point on where christ is going to be and when the revelation is made known it's the unveiling of christ and we see where he's been that's what the seals opened up to us is where christ has been the last two thousand years and what he's been doing and how he's been redeeming he says the book of revelations the greek word apocalypse which means the unveiling taking a veil off a statue is really what the greek means by taking the veil from a statue and letting the people see what's been made and it's the revelation of jesus christ in his church what is the book of revelation the revelation of jesus christ in his church what did the seals open up how he's been redeeming for the last 2000 years christ through his church but the prophet told us that when he unlocked those seals it unlocked the entire bible not just the last two thousand years amen let's go to revelation chapter two verse one unto the angel of the church of the ephesians write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks brother branham is going to pick up this statement because when john turned to see the one who spoke to him which what what is john receiving the revelation of jesus christ don't ever forget that friends john is receiving the revelation of jesus christ john's a type of the bride he's receiving the revelation of jesus christ and jesus christ is revealing himself through his church and now now we come to uh ephesians and where where he saw when he turned to see the voice of the one speaking to him he saw seven candlesticks and in the midst of the candlesticks one like to the son of man and then we got the description of that but now we get a a little further depiction or declaration of christ and the candlesticks he says now uh uh let's read it again unto the angel the church of the ephesians right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks that means he's walking in the midst he's not stationary he's in motion he says in the ephesians church age walking in the midst of these seven golden candlesticks was jesus christ the almighty god what is he doing he didn't say he was walking in one candle stick he was walking in the midst of all of them what does that denote that he is the same god yesterday today and forever and in every church age to every believer he comes to with the holy ghost to every age and to every person same yesterday today and forever so what's he doing in the seven church ages he's walking through the set he's walking in the midst of the seven churches once he's moving through the church ages what is this movement all about it's christ building his bride building his body through seven church ages what is it it's the revelation of himself he's revealing himself in feminine form and he's in the church this is the revelation of jesus christ he's in the candlesticks walking in the midst of the candlesticks through seven church ages where has he been he's been there all along that's what the seals opened up where has he been it's been him it's been him moving been him moving and moving and moving what's he doing building from the legs amen up to the arms up to the head what's he doing he's now expressing himself in his bride form amen he's building a bride through seven church ages it's he himself walking in the midst of the seven church ages now he says now remember in the first of the church ages as we close he was walking among the seven golden candlesticks is that right the seven church ages and at the end here we find him outside of the church the laosei and the laodicean church let's go to revelation chapter 3. let's start at the latest in church age in verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not thou art wretched and miserable and poor blind and naked this is the condition of the church in the end time i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes as that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chase and be zealous therefore and repent i want to go back and read verse 18 again i counseled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and anointed on eyes with eyes after thou may see friends everything he's offering to laodicea he offered in the message of the hour if you want the gold tried on fire if you want the white raiment to cover your neckiness and you want the anointing oil anoint your eyes it's all in the message of the hour amen and if you refuse the message you stay in blindness and nakedness and wretchedness and misery because everything he provided to the laodicean age to bring them out of that condition he provided through the message of the hour the message is the word it's our white raiment it's the gold amen the revelation of god himself it is the i salve amen to open our eyes to see it's all in the message the message has the cure for laodicea verse 20 and behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open this is where we find him outside the church when you look at revelation 1 the revelation of jesus christ he's standing in the midst of the seven candlesticks amen then when you look at ephesus he's the one who's walking through the midst of the candlesticks but now when you get to the end of the laodicean church age he's standing outside knocking on the door amen i thought he was in the candlesticks i thought he was walking through the candlesticks but now we see a transition at the end of the laodicean church age something we haven't seen previously but now the one who was in the midst of the of the the candlesticks the one who was walking is now outside the church knocking on the door behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcome and have set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith and to the churches here's what the prophet of god goes on to say the most pathetic scripture i've ever seen is is revelations the third chapter when at the laodicean church a jesus standing on the outside of his own church knocking trying to get back in at the first church he was walking through the seven golden candlesticks the church ages but in laodicea he was on the outside trying to get back in his own church it shows what this age has done to him in the unveiling of god he said for this act he changes his form then he come the form of son of man now i want to stop for just a minute and show that when he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and when he's walking through the midst of the seven candlesticks he's in the form of son of god he's the holy ghost in the church but something changes when they reject him and put him outside the church when they reject him and put him outside the church now he's going to change form and he's going to begin operating in another form the signal is when they rejected christ amen when they rejected him amen and pushed him out of the of the churches when they pushed him out in laodicea now he begins another manifestation of himself he comes in another form that's why this book of revelation is the revelation of jesus christ let's read this he changes his form then he come in the form of son of man he's been son of god for nearly 2 000 years but when they reject him now they've pushed the son of god out the holy ghost out and now he's coming to reveal himself the son of man for the reformers age wesley luther and all down through when they find out that they got to so bundled up just like the israelites did to when he does appear in the last days and the pentecostal age as the holy spirit they rejected it they did the same thing israel did and what does he do now return as son of man and then from that son of david see how close we are son of man son of david son of god he is revealed in the last days as son of man according to malachi 4 so brother man it's attaching this to malachi 4 behold i send you a lie the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord and all the rest of the prophecies pertaining to this hour no more dealing with the church they put him out on the outside knocking at the door so this son of man ministry this of son of man was not for the churches anymore he's not dealing with the churches anymore they put him out a son of god now he's coming a son of man to reveal himself in another way and another expression what is it the revealing the unveiling of jesus christ now he's unveiling himself as son of man for we have son of god through the church ages then son of man is is the prophetic office the son of man is jesus christ in flesh jesus christ in flesh is the son of man and then when he's finished with that it's going to be son of god in the millennium when he sits upon the throne of david his father that's why brother bram said see how close we are we've already moved they've pushed him out in the later season church ages son of god he's come back a son of god a man attaching it to malachi 4. luke 17 30 in the revealing of the son of man what is it it's the prophetic office it's jesus christ in the form of a prophet a son of man revealing the son of man and it's the revelation of jesus christ amen and when he comes to that point he's no more dealing with the church they put him out now he says jesus said that would come again as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man again the spirit of god will come upon mortal human flesh as it was in sodom what happened in sodom amen when god came upon mortal human flesh god picked up dust of the earth and he made himself a body and god himself stepped into that body and came to speak to abraham and when he spoke to abraham he told abraham the plan of god he told abraham the timing of god he was revealing the word to abraham and as he was revealing the plan to abraham he discerned the thoughts of sarah in the tent behind him showing the sign of the messiah is that right so now we're going to have a repeat of that where there's going to be god the life of jesus christ is going to step back into a body of flesh a son of man revealing the son of man brother branham wasn't the son of man he was the vessel a son of man that the son of man was going to work in and to prove it he would turn his back to the crowd and say over here is a sister and this brother and you this and that showing that we've come right back to this place we're in the son of man ministry that jesus christ himself is here working in human flesh he's not dealing with the churches anymore they put him down this is not the son of god ministry anymore this is the son of man this is god himself stepping into flesh amen to to manifest himself and he was doing that in that prophet and the spirit of god will come upon mortal human flesh brother branham is talking about his own flesh this is why so many times brother branham would say things like now i hope you're catching it i hope i don't have to come right out and say it i i hope you're getting my meaning he's not wanting to stand up and say listen god is in my flesh listen to what i'm saying if you ignore what i'm saying you're rejected because christ is here he's basically saying he's not in your churches he's not in your systems he's not in your theology he's not there he is in me right now and the only way to get the revelation of jesus christ is come to the vessel that he is in but he didn't want to come right out and say that i mean who does but that's what he can't say because the third pool he can't say he can't give the full revelation the third pool can't be spoken out the the elect has to catch it again the spirit of god will come upon mortal human flesh that man eat the meat of a calf drink the milk from a cow eat butter and bread in human flesh and abraham said he was elohim god manifested in flesh jesus promised that god before his coming would be manifested in human flesh again did you see it have you seen it have you seen him discern the thoughts of sarah in the tent behind him have you seen him give the plan to abraham and reveal his mind to abraham wow we're discerning the thoughts of sarah and the tent behind him we have seen amen the fulfillment of malachi 4 revolut luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 we have seen it we have heard it we have witnessed of it it is god himself working through human flesh that's why you cannot reject that human flesh that's just flesh but it's the flesh that god spoke through it's the one he chose and that is the son of man coming back into the church listen when we want to see the son of man coming back into the church people want to see nail pierced hands but brother branham said we don't look for nail pierced hands we look for the word made manifest to recognize him and when the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself come back into the church it came through the prophecy of malachi 4. luke 17 30. that was in the prophet brother branham there's no wiggle room on that and there's no way around that and without that we do not have the revelation of jesus christ improving his word now follow this quote carefully in the days of sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man it's referring to the same thing when the son of man is being revealed not no more as church not no more the bride is called see the prophet of god uh yeah i skipped back to the previous one i don't want you to read ahead so some of you are so slick you look at me then look up and look at me and look up but your eyebrows are giving you away brother branham is telling us he's no longer dealing with the church because the church put him out so when we come to the to the son of man ministry he's been pushed out of the laodicean church ages son of god and now he's coming in another form as son of man he's he's further revealing himself he's giving a greater manifestation what is it jesus christ revealing himself this is the revelation of jesus christ and he says not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called see it's not church ages anymore when we get to this point he's done dealing with the church now he's calling a bride and how is he calling a bride he's calling a bride one by one amen he's not dealing with a system he's not dealing with a group he's not dealing with the church he is calling his bride he's calling her by revealing himself as the son of man at the end of the church ages revealing the word opening the seals declaring the mystery is him calling her name amen and she has something on the inside of her ears to hear that are not these ears listen when brother branham talks talking about the restoration of the bride tree and he starts preaching he goes oh he goes how i wish i could go back to ezekiel and pull up those dry bones and he's showing the three stages of the church coming back the restoration of the bride tree the church coming through luther through wesley through pentecost now standing upon her feet but there was one last thing that had to come a calling for the wind which was the life and the life had to enter back in and they'd be a mighty marching army marching to zion amen and so he's showing he's taking ezekiel and he's showing how through through the church ages the body has been built back up and now it's back there but it's going to take another speaking of the prophet another prophecy a calling forth for the wind for the life for the spirit to come back in full measure back into this army again and then it's a marching army but listen to what he says hear ye dry bones the word of the lord how did those bones hear he is not talking about natural hearing this has nothing to do with your ability to play a tape you can play a tape and you can hear the prophet's voice but you're going to have to have a whole different set of ears than these you have to have the same ears those dry bones had that could hear the prophecy from the prophet ezekiel and they would start coming together bone to bone send you to send you it wasn't these that will get the job done you can come to service after service play tape after tape but you're going to have to have another set of ears down on the inside to hear what the spirit is speaking to the church amen see not no more bride is called in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the bride so why the ministry of brother branham why the seventh angel why the son of man ministry in that man why jesus christ himself amen showing amen brother brahman said you know that's not me i can't do that that has to be him he said my whole ministry is to declare that he's here amen you didn't touch me you didn't touch the hem of my garment you touched his garment what's he trying to do he's trying to show you that he's here that it's really him amen it's him he's here he's present he's in this vessel but it's jesus christ what did he come for so you could say that was jesus christ and that man his whole purpose was unite the head and the body together to bring the marriage to the bride that ministry was not so that we can play tapes and we could we can listen to testimonies and say wasn't that a great thing god did through brother branham wow to see a man so consecrated that god was working that wasn't the whole point friends the point was so that you would recognize your day and hour so that he would wake you up out of your denominational sleep so that the the isaf would come in you could get the wedding garment that ministry was here to unite the headship and the body back together the whole purpose of the end time message is you married to christ to receive the headship which is what the restored word which is who christ which is what the revelation of god it's all god and that in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together what human flesh did he come down into to unite the headship to the body he came in the flesh of that prophet william branham that was god in that man but what was the purpose not to say put him up on a pedestal and say whoa that was god and that man he came to unite you with the headship amen he come to unite you with christ he come to the god through him was going to reveal the mystery of the entire bible take the seals off open our eyes amen so that we would recognize who we are who he is what our purpose is and by that receive the headship and be united back together in a marriage union in an invisible union with jesus christ himself that was the purpose that's why what was it it was the ministry of jesus christ himself in human flesh now listen brother branham had to deal with an issue in brew serpent and that issue was they were baptizing in his name and calling him christ believing that he himself his flesh body the man that was born a woman was jesus christ but he himself wasn't jesus christ it was jesus christ in full expression inside that vessel right now that's why in dawson riley's testimony dawson said brother venom told him you know they're baptizing in my name and and dawson said he says he goes i just thought you know wow and brother branham said they're not as far off as you think and then i think dawson made the comment like wow i thought they was pretty far off so the ones who believed that brother branham was god and was jesus christ and were baptizing in his name i'm going to make a shocking statement but don't be offended they may have been closer than the ones that were offended by them doing them they may have been closer to the truth than the ones that were appalled by them doing that because it was ace on a man revealing the son of man it was the ministry of jesus christ himself working through that fallen flesh that had been redeemed it wasn't the flesh it was god in the flesh brother branham says it's like a razor's blade between truth and a lie because we don't want to be a part of a lie sometimes we want to stay way way away no he says it's a razor blade difference between truth and life if you want the truth you've got to get close to the lie the lie was that that man himself was jesus christ the truth was that that was jesus christ in that man to get the truth you've got to get a razor's width away from the lie that's why only the elect is going to make it through this message [Music] the truth is so shocking it's so remarkable it's so marvelous that it takes your breath away that it seems unbelievable that something in you believes it only the elect can go down this road only the elect can bring believe the truth the full truth and stay in the full truth without taking the half step over to fanaticism into a lie and the bride will not move herself so far away from fanaticism and a lie that she no longer believes the truth but she's the only one that can walk on this edge of this razor blade why by revelation not by education not my natural ears but by revelation she's going to catch what this is when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman oh do you see brother venom's wanting you to see it's in order to unite you the word the bride word the bridegroom word has to get united together in order to unite that it is going to take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man it takes this prophetic ministry at the end time to unite you to the headship it takes the the prince zerubbabel to bring down the headstone with shoutings of grace grace unto it amen so that you can recognize the grace in this hour and be united to the headship it takes the revealing of the son of man now let's go further in the same quote what i mean see it's son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us i hope you got that by now jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not the marriage then he goes to quote part of a scripture fill your flesh yourself of all the flesh of the mighty men because the marriage of the lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding somewhere when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son done he was the word the church does the same thing so now we know it takes the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man when jesus christ himself comes down into flesh to manifest himself and it'll take that to unite the bride to the the body to the head but after that what does it do that for what happens next when the word here unites with the person that's you and they too become one that's the invisible union and then what does it do then it manifest the son of man again it didn't stop with brother branham all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into the bride to his church amen god jesus christ was here amen in that son of man revealing himself the son of man it was the jesus christ himself in flesh [Music] the flesh of brother branham manifesting declaring the revelation of the son of man to unite the head and the body together to do what to manifest the son of man again he didn't go back to being son of god this when brother brenham left the scene he did not go back amen to being what he was in the church ages amen they kicked him out as son of god amen now he comes the son of man when brother branham leaves the son of man doesn't leave amen when he leaves it doesn't go back to being son of god brother bam told us it's son of god son of man son of david he doesn't go back to being son of god what it was in the church ages what that was in brother branham is now in fullness in the bride it's the ministry of jesus christ himself in a flesh body on this earth but it's a many membered body now brother branham was the wave sheath that was plugged up and showed this is it this is it this is it and god when he finished that ministry to unite the two he says now he must increase and i must decrease how is he increasing he's increasing in the mini-membered bride the wave she showed what was coming to the crop now it's got to mature in the crop and now that son of man is in you and i yeah what is this we're talking about the revelation of jesus christ the book of revelations that was sealed with seven seals and when that opened it opened the entire bible it didn't just open the church ages it opened the entire bible christ is revealed in his own word for jesus himself is the interpretation of the bible when he may when he's made manifest in the age that that part of his body is being made manifest if it's a hand age it must be a hand it can't be a head age if it's a voice age well then it can't be a foot age see now we're at the i age and the next is him himself to come seeing prophetic brother i'm saying we're now at the ih why he said seeing prophetic we're at the we're at malachi 4. we're at the prophet we're at the seeing but he said there's something to come next after the prophet's ministry there's something to come next see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it come out through the feet luther come back out through wesley then the pentecostals the tongues and the lips see now it's in the eyes prophetic malachi 4. is there any question he's got a bill he's got the body built all the way up to the eyes amen malachi 4 amen the ministry of the prophet and so and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that to what the body that's being formed over seven church ages it's formed through the legs to the thighs through the arms to the head through the mouth pentecostal speaking in tongues to the eyes amen the prophet restoring the word but there's nothing left now but for the mind he himself the headship the person of jesus christ himself to step into that to what the body after what after the seeing now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence what is the intelligence the thought of god the mind of christ the word that has been restored in this hour we have no sight of our own a man how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's god himself it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like adam did at the beginning like adams was rather at the beginning so now he brings us all the way down through amen we've gone through the old testament come through the new testament got to the end of the church ages now at the opening of the seals amen it's a son of man revealing the son of man christ himself is the one who opens those seals and reveals how he's been redeeming where he's been what he's been doing for the last two thousand years and now he's stepping into that body that bride at the end time that's on the earth at the end time now he's stepping down the intelligence the headship he himself the full revelation is coming down to that body and it's to reveal the son of man again now the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride this is the revelation of jesus christ it can't be complete until you have a revelation of the bride it can't be finished until you have the bride formed into the image of christ it can't be complete without the bride genesis chapter 2 verse 18 he says and the lord god said it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a helpmeet for him and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every creature that was the name thereof and adam gave names to all cattle and to the foul of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam but for adam there was not found to help me for him and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man this is one of the most profound scriptures in all of the bible because it will be the description of the rest of the bible brother brahm says that's what the church is doing for jesus is the word and he's the bridegroom and the bride is a part of the bridegroom what was the bride in eden a part of the bridegroom in eden therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience same life and when god separated adam he was both we find out adam was spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created him male and female and in genesis 2 and and on he created man out of the dust of the earth man was created in god's image god is a spirit so he's a spirit man then when he's become flesh man animal flesh on the earth he is showing or portraying hear the bride so go back to genesis chapter 2 what is god showing in genesis chapter 2 he's showing the book he's showing the plan he's showing the bride he never taken and made another being but he took part of adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took the feminist spirit out of adam left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminist part therefore part of his spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to christ he says all the old testament was types that pointed to christ in his church you believe adam and eve pointed to christ in his church you believe jehovah and his wife pointed to christ in his church well them are types and this is the anti-time it has to be like the type because the type takes from the anti-type takes from the type christ is the head the true stone of god you believe that the true word the bride is the body let me go to genesis 2 a little further down in verse 23 and adam said this is now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh adam did not look at this other creature and say what are you who are you introduce yourself to me where did you come from he says you are me this is what this is what adam is saying he's saying you or me i am you we are one adam said this is now bone of my bones flesh and my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh amen what is god doing all the way back in the beginning of the bible amen he he is creating and he's forming and fashioning the world and putting it in a certain order by a spoken word and the spoken word is ordering something he's making something you can tell that he's doing something with creation he's ordering it and fashioning it and placing it and getting it all regimented and all ordered and all outlined and after he does that amen he he says let us bring forth a man in our image in our likeness male and female amen so now god is going to create a man in his likeness but from the very beginning he calls it male and female male and female male and female what is this god wants to be expressed in male and female from the very beginning so god takes the man what is the man he's the reflection or the expression of god adam on earth was the reflection of god his father he's a type of christ he's on earth he's ruling and reigning upon the creation of god god made a perfect setting and he placed him in the setting amen but god was not finished with his great work amen because he's not completed yet i've talked about this before you can tell that god's not done because god doesn't go to his rest yet he's still finishing the task at hand and the task at hand was to create a masterpiece and when he finished the first part of that masterpiece it was a perfect man and then that perfect man was a reflection of god amen but the expression of god was not completed yet he wasn't finished in his masterpiece work because the man was alone and he said it's not good that the man should dwell alone whether it was god who made him there alone how could it not be good the only reason he said it's not good so that you and i will understand god was not finished this was not his period on his creation this was not his period on his masterpiece he had something else he wanted to express in the beginning so he struck a little blow brother branham said to his left side pulled out a rib a part of himself and out of that part of himself he fashioned another atom do you believe that he didn't make something different that's why he had to take from adam he took from adam and he refashioned this portion of adam amen into another vessel but it wasn't something different it was still adam but now god was expressed in man male and female and god brought the two together brother man said the first marriage that was ever performed was performed in the garden of eden and adam said they are now one flesh one flesh the male form of adam was adam's flesh the female form of adam was adam's flesh god was not finished making adam until he put him to sleep and pulled out a part of adam and fashion it to another vessel and put the two back together then he was finished making adam then he put them in rulership upon his earth in the garden ruling from the garden ruling creation and then he took his rest he was done this is what i had in my mind amen we know the serpent slipped in created a fall we know the fall works to god's plan to reveal all of his attributes but god's plan was not going to be defeated this brother branham tells us that as masterpiece fell the great image the great statue the great work of our it fell he said but he wasn't going to leave it in ruin he started right away making it over again i'd like to present to you that that's what this is your bible is the record of him rebuilding that masterpiece and that masterpiece is jesus christ male and female the son of god male and female this is a book of redemption redeeming what redeeming the original masterpiece that fell he went right to work immediately and started building it back and he worked in the old testament to build back the last atom the final the last atom then he struck a little blow to his left side and pulled out the elements he needed to build his bride and for 2 000 years he's been building the bride but at the end there's going to be a wedding like there was in eden like the first marriage that ever was performed now there's been a son of man on earth to do what to unite the headship and the body together the marriage of the bride and now they've been united back together again what is this bible all about it's all about jesus christ the mystery of god revealed jesus christ male and female because the mystery of god is god always wanted to dwell as a family upon the earth he wanted to materialize he wanted to become tangible he wanted to come down to the earth he was going to do it through eden and there was going to be offspring there was going to be more that came forth he said all the elements were laying here but it fell into ruin but that didn't stop his plan he kept working right on and he started working a plan of redemption and at the end he will have what he originally started with there's going to be a perfection on this earth again and his sons and daughters his attributes portions of himself that have been come down materialized are going to be upon this earth and he will be fellowshipping with his family that is the mystery of god and jesus christ is the mystery of god revealed that's why this entire bible is christ it's the rebuilding of the masterpiece let's go a little further he said now i'm choosing of a bride the other is pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and the woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word christ is one body the word so what is the bride the word what word the part of the word to be made manifest today which is christ in the formation of a bride in the end time they're to be united again she has to be molded and made into the image of christ and christ is the word that's the only thing see it's in there the word there cannot be one thing added cannot be a woman with one hand like a man the other hand like a paul like a dog it's got to be exactly the word of the lord like he is the word the bride is a part of the bridegroom the woman is a part of her husband because she's taken out of the husband eve was a part of adam from his side and so is the bride not taking from a denomination but taken from the bosom of the word of god for this day what was she pulled out of she was pulled out of the word for this day not taken out of a denomination god didn't pluck you out of a denomination he pulled you out of himself the word for this day now for nearly 2 000 years god has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck adam to get a piece of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect masterpiece that he struck at calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the new testament that's all he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and old is husband and wife and it taken the new the old to foreshadow the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece in the making so what is the bible it's christ what is christ the mystery of god what is the mystery of god that god wanted to materialize on this earth he wanted to become tangible and crowded he did it he did it through christ what is christ the word made manifest his attributes coming into manifestation is god making himself tangible upon the earth this bible the old testament is groom the new testament is bride he come forth to restore the first part of the masterpiece in jesus christ and he was the perfect son of god redeeming back all that adam lost but the picture wasn't perfect yet we can't go to the millennium which is rest because god couldn't go to rest until he finished the work that he was initially doing until he finished the masterpiece we could not go to millennium after calvary i understand he paid the price but we could not go to millennium after calvary until he brought forth the bride and after he brought forth the bride and united them together now we can go to millennium which is the restoration to eden you can't do it till the bride's been restored until the marriage has come together and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and others has spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him that may sound strange to your friends it shouldn't by now we've preached it so many times but she is him the same way the woman was him in the garden when you look at when when you look at at eve she didn't have the name eve she was not eve she was woman her name was adam he made them and called their name adam they were adam male adam female they were the same they were one they were united they she came out of him she was part of him she was not ever to have her own identity when she took her own identity by taking adultery by taking another thought amen and manifesting that wrong thought she got a name then eve is the name of adultery because it's the mother of all living how did she become the mother of all living by adultery by leaving the word her name was adam amen this bride's name is jesus christ amen it is christ in bright form amen not something different a further expression of the same one the same person that's why the book of revelation is the revelation of jesus christ and immediately you see him standing in the midst of seven candlesticks this is not bridegroom form anymore now this is the revelation of jesus christ in bride form and she is him she's his word she's part of the word part of the mystery what god wanted to express before the foundation of the world is now being expressed in her and she is him he's the word she has to be the word and the word is coming to the word to finish the masterpiece so that now we can go to the millennium so that god see god he he molded and made for six thousand years until he finally got a man and his wife that he could put in charge of the whole creation and then he went and took his rest and while he was resting brother and said his rest was interrupted that means there's something in the program of god that's unfulfilled and what's unfulfilled is god's thousand-year rest that's why at the restoration of the bride uniting with christ amen there's going to be a finishing of redemption and christ the earth is going to burn and christ is going to come back to set on the throne of his father david and his bride will rule and reign with him for a thousand years amen what's he going to do just like in the garden of eden when he got a son and his son's wife and he put him in charge of it all he took his rest now he's building back another son and his son's wife to put him back in charge in the millennium so he can take his rest because that's an uncompleted part of the plan of god and there'll be no part of the plan of god uncompleted he will have his seventh day amen he will have his rest why how when he puts a son and his son's wife over the creation again praise be to god the revelation of jesus christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he is now the bible expresses it's growing in the bride to the full stature therefore the corn of wheat of christ had to fall in the ground and and so did the bride have to fall in the ground through the dark ages and any grain that goes in the ground must die or it can't produce itself produce itself and the great church that he established on the day of pentecost by the sending of the holy ghost had to suffer martyrdom and go into the dirt and into the earth in the dark age to bring forth again the age of luther and come on out to the full stature of the bride of jesus christ for this last day that is the manifestation of this hour oh god if the world could only see that that god and man are one the super sign was that first man that god could come into all that god was he poured into christ that was the super sign and all that christ was he poured into the church super sign god and man together that was to be the super sign of the last day when the entire bible was to be fulfilled in the last day what is the entire bible what will be the fulfilling of the time bible when you have the full restoration of the bridegroom and the full restoration of the bride and you unite those two things back together that's the expression of the entire bible that is why when he opened these seals it opened up the entire bible because there's a mystery in the entire bible and that mystery is god wanted to be expressed in jesus christ and christ is male and female he showed it in eden it fell and he's been rebuilding it all the way back and you and i are part of the last part of that rebuilding to be the bride manifest in full measure in this day upon the earth jesus christ and you and i the son of man ministry that is the reality of where we are that is why opening seals unlocked the entire bible because the entire bible is the restoration back to eden and if you don't unlock the mystery of the bride you haven't unlocked the entire bible when you look and see christ as the redeemer you can look down through the bible and you can see him coming as moses the redeemer to deliver you could see him coming as joseph rejected of his brothers and cast into a pit ascended on the right hand of power to save his brother you can see him as joshua amen you could see him as david amen cast out and run amen from cave decay finally coming into power you can see christ christ christ christ christ but at the revealing of the seven seals you can go right back to that same old testament said moses had a gentile wife joseph had a gentile wife that he dismissed to the palace before he revealed himself to his brothers amen you can go back now and say abraham was the type of christ amen and abraham and sarah brought forth the promised son but if you look a little deeper you're going to say there was something special about sarah too because after sarah got a visitation from the god from god and after she conceived and brought forth the promised sign now the word was in her because she looks at abraham and she says cast out the bondwoman and her son for the the child of the bondwoman shall not be heir amen with my son and he said wow and abraham didn't know what to do about that so he goes to the lord and the lord says hearken to the voice of thy wife for what she says is right and then you go to the new testament to the book of galatians and the apostle paul picks it up and says doth not scripture say doth not scripture say doth not scripture say cast out the bondwoman and her son who said the scripture sarah amen sarah the woman after amen after she received the word after the visitation on the plains of mamrie after god unfleshed the son of man after she turned back young after she conceived c after she brought forth the word then she had the word the word was in her abraham didn't say she said and the apostle paul says doth not scripture say he could have just easily said did not god say through sarah what was that that was that was the secret not being fully revealed yet he was letting it out he was shadowing it every character in the bible has been showing this great mystery every character all the details it's been expressing but not letting it out in full holding it back to the end time until the seals can be peeled off and you can say oh my goodness look at esther look at ruth and boaz look at salmon and rahab look at the gentile wife the gentile wife the gentile wife and the lineage of christ i see it now amen when he took the seals off it unlocked the entire bible the entire bible was christ was going to be the very desire mystery thought of god was going to be expressed in jesus christ and jesus christ was going to be male and female amen and the female was going to be a mini-membered bride and he was going to have a bride of his own choosing that he took out of the gentiles a gentile bride so in the old testament he showed a gentile bride a gentile bride a gentile bride what was it they were expressing it but not revealing it holding it back expressing the mystery that's why he said the entire bible has been expressing this mystery and until he unlocked the seven seals which unlocked the new testament which opened up where christ has been for the last two thousand years where he's been in the midst of the church how he's coming back a son of man how he's uniting with the bride then we don't see the mystery of the whole bible when we don't see the mystery of the bride so when i was asking god i want to fully understand when he says when he unlocked those seven seals that unlocked the entire bible i was laying in bed praying god i want to understand it better i feel like i got some understanding i want to understand it better and all of a sudden all these scriptures and quotes start coming back friends unless the bride is manifest the mystery of god is not finished but when the bride is built back through seven church ages and at the end time she's united with the headship now expressing jesus christ in the formation of his bride that is finishing the mystery of god that's under the seventh seal that's under the opening of these seals and the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god should be finished where is it being finished it's being finished and you and i you are finishing the mystery of god that is a sobering that is one of those things that take your breath away cause you to step back and say what is this message i thought it was a gifted man it's more than a gifted man friends i thought it was a a restoration of all the truths that were lost through the through the church ages it's more than the restoration of truths friend it's the son of man the ministry of christ himself come back to unite the head and the body to finish the mystery of god that's why when you look at those seals you go back in those seals the first four are anointings horse riders that are antichrists four anointings of the holy ghost that are christ what's he doing building his church protecting them from the false two vines coming through what is it it's the church ages what's he doing he's walking in the midst of the church ages and these anointings are guiding his bride keeping them from the antichrist protecting them from the horse riders bringing them up truth by truth by truth by truth and to the restoration of the bride tree and in the fifth seal he shows how he saved how he is going to save have grace upon the jews amen that died from the time of christ on that's the last two thousand years that's not all the jews that's not six thousand years from the time of christ on what is this it's unlocking the new testament and how he had to blind them to take the gentile bride because he blinded him for a gentile bride he'll give them white robes at the white throne judgment as an act of grace because he had to blind them to get a gentile bride what's the seals about the bride what's their what's their white robes attached to he had to blind them to get a bride it's all about the bride we go to the sixth steel then the sixth deal was the purging of the foolish virgin that were along with the bride all the way through but just didn't have oil just couldn't see it the purging of the 144 000 which is the redemption of israel and the purging of earth for the honeymoon rain what is the seals it's the mystery of the new testament and when he when he opened those seals he unlocked the entire bible because you can't know christ if you don't see his bride you couldn't fully know adam until the bride came forth to express that part of adam that had to be expressed in that form god 2 000 years ago couldn't finish the work because the bride had to come forth she had to be built up she had to be displayed she had to be united back with her bridegroom then the earth has to be purged and she goes back for the thousand year reign tell your friends this message is unbelievable when you hear the message like that do you want to argue about doctrine no desire i'm not interested if you have this take or that take this is the only thing i can see now this is the whole purpose this is the whole bible that's been unlocked look christ in you makes him the center of the life of the revelation see christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ and christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do he's trying to reveal his mystery in this end time colossians 1 26 even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory all that scripture means more and more to us all the time friends it says what is it not them people the headship and the body has become one unit it's god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer twain they are one god and his church is one christ in you god's great revelation the mystery of god revealed revelations 10 7 unfolding in you and i glory to god even bearing his name his name is jesus the anointed wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the apocalypses the unveiling of jesus christ how was he unveiled in the midst of seven golden candlesticks walking in seven golden candlesticks as four anointings that was guarding and protecting his church through the church ages and at the end time he was put out of that a son of god and come back a son of man and a prophetic ministry to unite the head and the body together and then bring forth the son of man again now christ the headship and his body are one and she is the manifestation of this hour it's my last quote the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is oh friends that's why god keeps taking listen there is not one quote that i read this morning that i have not read here before there is not one scripture that i read here that i have not read before but god is constantly peeling back the layers and peeling back the layers peeling back the layers because this bride has got to know what she is amen what is she she is him amen she is the word she is the mystery she she is part of that great mystery that god had when god dwelt alone was his thoughts she was there amen when the logos came out she was there amen when he was manifest as jesus christ she was there and now she is here taking her manifestation in her turn that's why when he opened those seals it opened the book of revelation the revelation is the apocalypse of jesus christ and a bride he was already had an apocalypses of jesus christ as a bridegroom but the book of revelation in the new testament is the apocalypse of jesus christ in bride bridegroom bride husband wife united to make the whole bible now it's not two parts of a bible testament new testament we're living in a day where it's one bible one story one goal that he wanted to achieve in the entire bible one purpose he had and that purpose amen was expressed in jesus christ the manifested manifestation of god almighty we've come to the day where it's not 66 books it's not a moral code it's not a book of systems it's not a book of theology the message wasn't here to show a mighty gifted man the message was here to to take the body bring it up unite it with the head amen and now the the expression of jesus christ is in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this end time and when she's done expressing that when the last member comes and she's done expressing that then he'll lift her up purge the earth and they'll come back down to finish the unfinished part in the beginning of the book god our father will take his rest when his son and his son's wife sit upon the throne in the millennium brother bram said now do you see the message all the arguing all the fussing all the fussing over details i say god give me wings like an eagle let me fly on the ingo wigs of this prophet and lift up above the carnality of of all of the trying to decipher and trying to figure out and let me see this mystery and if you reveal this mystery everything else fits into this mystery everything else brother brenham said everything he was doing every everything that he taught fits to this mystery and when he opened the seals now do you believe it we believed it before but now do you believe it when he opened the seals he opened the entire bible amen praise be to god let's all stand musicians if you'll come i said it before and i'll say it again like jesus said to his disciples many righteous men many prophets long to see this day amen long to see this day and we live in a day that's going to take greater revelation than has ever struck to earth to bring a greater manifestation this is the hour for so god brought back the fullness of his word he brought back his mind he what did god bring back to us he sent a prophet who could go into the back part of the mind of god where this book was sealed when he was alone with his thoughts god could take the prophet back there and bring that mystery down and show it through the bible and we could find out what god was thinking about when he dwelt alone with his thoughts who else in the history of this creation has been able to do that who else has been able to do that friends when when when you know isaiah gave a prophecy but isaiah never saw the fulfillment of that prophecy moses gave a prophecy he never saw the isaiah can you imagine how isaiah would ponder i wonder how a virgin conceived is that now is that in the future is it the virgin nation is it one person will it be the daughter of the high priest will be a commoner can you imagine how he wondered you know what would isaiah have exchanged to see the baby in the manger think about that if he had the opportunity would he give up wealth would he give up popularity would he give up everything what would he give up to actually see the fulfillment of the prophecy what are we willing to give up because we see the fulfillment of the prophecy oh paul was laboring with the church says i i travail in birth i travail again till christ before you i want to see christ in you he said i have espoused you unto one husband but i fear lest as evil as begotten you shall be beguiled how paul would have loved to stand here and see what we see and hear what we hear the fulfillment of what he was preaching what he was longing for what he was trying to protect the church from what he was trying to guide them to now we're here righteous men holy men godly men prophets long to see this day and you and i are here and god has so taken his mind so perfectly and unveiled it opened himself with the complete apocalypses of jesus christ the unveiling of jesus christ was the opening of the mystery of god revelation 10 7 and he's given it to common human beings and when you break it down in its rawest form it's so simple a five-year-old can understand it god showed what he wanted to do in making a man and his wife and that fell and he's been restoring it all the way back and it'll be restored in jesus christ and his bride how complicated is that what is it it's the mystery of god that is finished in this day finished in you and i i wonder if we sufficiently appreciate the word in our minds i don't think we've even begun to understand what is all around us i don't even think we've begun to comprehend what god wants to do through us i don't even think we can even begin to comprehend how much we are changing by the word and where he wants to take this manifestation and what he wants to declare i don't think we can even begin to understand but i'm saying god help me to see give me that i sap let me have the gold tried and fired let me have the white raiment let me have the isaf god this is i tell your friends when god opens his word it's the greatest thrill of my life i have never experienced the thrill more exciting than god revealing himself i said god keep revealing yourself to us we need you lord we believe this message we believe that you've called forth for a bride manifestation in this day and we're apart we believe it with all of our hearts that this is the son of man ministry in a bright form i believe it with all my heart but god help me to see it correctly help me to recognize it in every area of my life help me to manifest it to live it to portray it is my desire let me be everything that i'm looking at let me see it clearly and let me live it is that your prayer too let's bow our heads and pray oh lord jesus we thank you god your word is so rich it's so beautiful it's so amazing lord oh god how we can read it and listen to it over and over and over again reading the same messages listening the same tapes reading the same scriptures bible verse over and over quoting it by heart and then in a moment's time you'll take us and open our understanding to understand the scriptures and god the thrill that unlocks from our soul when you do that is beyond what words can describe [Music] oh father how appreciative we are that you are unveiling yourself before your bride so that if we can understand you we can understand ourselves and we can understand the portion that you've called for manifestation in this day god may we make a greater surrender no wonder you had to have preeminence in this day because preeminence is the only way that you can perfectly manifest yourself in human flesh god help us to give you that preeminence help us to fulfill the purpose you have for us in this planet we love you god we ask that you go with us and be with us and guide us and all things we acknowledge you lord and we love you we surrender to you and may this plan work in
