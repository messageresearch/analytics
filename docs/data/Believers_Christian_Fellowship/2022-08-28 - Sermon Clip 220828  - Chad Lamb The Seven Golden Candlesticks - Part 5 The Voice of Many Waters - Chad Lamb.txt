TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in the great judgments of god god is going to bring every circumstance to his word so that there is no excuse on the day of judgment somebody will say you know but god i was handicapped and i i couldn't serve you he'll have somebody in his bride who was handicapped and served but god i didn't live near a church i couldn't drive two hours he'll have somebody who'll drive two hours to hear the word to show that that's no excuse you know somebody said you know if you knew what religious abuse i came from he'll have somebody in the bride who's come through religious abuse and surrender to the word there'll be no excuse on that day he said well i was neglected of my father if somebody was neglected of the father i was abused by my mother he'll have somebody who was abused by their mother just like you have somebody that will traverse the sands and deserts and robbers to come see solomon to stand as a testimony against a generation he'll have somebody who's went through persecution rejection abuse fallen pastors and and all kinds of uh troubles and and all kinds of vileness and and rejection and neglect he'll let all of that come to show that my word was enough that it would work and there's no excuse on that day nobody will have an excuse and we didn't drive two hours for that reason and we didn't we didn't overcome by god's grace rejection in complexes and neglect and abuse we did it because we loved him and we found his grace sufficient for us we did it because we were so happy that there was a word that can deliver us we came to him because he was our only option and our only source we gave him our life because for us it was a great exchange my life for eternal life my life for his it was an easy exchange for us but that very act amen will be condemnation for somebody who tries to use that same excuse for why they couldn't serve god and we never meant it for that we just lived the life he called us to we just lived grateful we lived for him we surrendered him because we had to because he put something in us that would live that way and i said let the word work in our lives and let it shine the light and everybody else just love them love them if i'm going to be guilty for anything i want to be guilty for being too kind too loving too generous and too merciful i don't want to be guilty of being too judgmental too critical if i'm going to make a mistake i want to make a mistake in being too kind and too loving and too generous god will sort everything out and make everything right on that day i don't have to sort it out today i don't have to figure it out i don't have to figure out the destination of all men and by the actions they commit where they fit in god will figure all that out i just want to love everybody because that person who's vile today could be my brother tomorrow that person who is living ungodly amen tomorrow could be sitting in the pew next to me the one that i hugged their neck every service i don't want to treat him bad i don't want to speak evil god will sort all that out
