TRANSCRIPT
========================================
says mold us and make us Sons and Daughters of God we believe the bride is getting its last polishing down it'll be spitten from the complete organization all together then the Great Harvest will be here now let's go to 218 now do you understand why I scold you that ain't because I I love you not because I don't love you I do love you I want masterpieces for the master I might have to tear a few out like this but it'll I I'll have a masterpiece some of these days if I keep it right on this word praise God remember brother BM now went into the vision back here and he began to describe the vision of he saw the bride coming forth and when he began that he said I may not know the just the right interpretation and he begins talking and he saw the bride coming into preview and she was beautiful and she was perfect in every way and she passed off the scene and now the voice said now the church will come and he said all the vulgarity and the filth and his heart like to drop then the American Church came and he just couldn't take it anymore and and in other plac he said he just bowed his head and he wept and he couldn't take it and then they went off into chaos following a witch but then the voice said but the bride will come into preview once more and then he saw again the sweet faces and those clean women coming forth and and he began to describe the two one was completely uncovered and and and they were they were vulgar and filthy and they were led by which and they were moving and twisting to the wrong kind of music and and and they were uncovered because they didn't have the word all they had was a little gray the gray piece of paper that was cut to make a fly bush to expand it bigger than they was and that's just the Creeds and dogmas of man amen but when he saw the bride he said it's amazing he said she had long skirts and long sleeves what's he saying she was fully covered she was completely covered by the word amen and so and she was marching to Onward Christian Soldiers and and and then he says but I caught it right in my preaching today he didn't have the interpretation when he had the vision but while he's preaching he said I had that before I had these notes he said but I caught it in the preaching this morning it's the alpha omega principle it's the seed that went in and the seed at the end but nothing in between it was all just a carrier but it would all go to complete death the stalk the tossel the husk amen you would only have life at the beginning and life at the end the bride that went into the uh ground and the bride that come forth is the same bride it's the alpha omega principle aren't you glad you're not in the husk age you're not in a stalk age yeah you're not in a tossel age but God has brought us forth in the seed age the wheat age the life age oh I'm so thankful I'm not worthy of it I don't deserve it and I don't always act like it but I am so thankful for it and I'm not looking to myself but I'm looking to that hued out place at Calvary where he struck him at Calvary and brought me out and I know he's going to take me right back and it'll be a perfect fit when he's done polishing this Stone thank God Almighty
