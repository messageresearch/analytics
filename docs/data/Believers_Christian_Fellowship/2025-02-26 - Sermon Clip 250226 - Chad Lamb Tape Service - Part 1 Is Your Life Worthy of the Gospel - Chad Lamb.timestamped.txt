[0:00] brother bam is is addressing in his
[0:02] prayer here there's a question about
[0:03] what is a Christian Life is it
[0:05] faithfulness to a church is it doing
[0:07] good deeds and to the poor and needy and
[0:09] really what he's going to get down to to
[0:12] the very core of it that we're going to
[0:14] find as your life worthy of the Gospel
[0:16] Living Christian Life is believing God
[0:19] when God's presented to
[0:21] you there are there are manifestations
[0:24] of that there are things that come with
[0:26] obedience but when you get down to the
[0:27] core of it it's not faithfulness to Aur
[0:29] church is not doing good to the needy or
[0:31] the poor it's receiving the word of God
[0:33] in your day that's really what he's
[0:36] going that's the heart of what he's
[0:37] trying to tell us is your life worthy of
[0:39] the gospel and I think we'll see that as
[0:41] we move on let's go to paragraph 39 on
[0:45] page
[0:52] 10 uh page 10 paragraph 39 him speaking
[0:56] directly to Israel the ones that was
[0:57] called To The Feast that I would also
[1:00] apply today to men the church who is
[1:02] bidden to come to the feast that won't
[1:04] do it the spiritual Feast of the Lord
[1:08] and they won't do it they don't want to
[1:10] do it they've got other things to do
[1:12] they find excuses so what have we bid to
[1:14] we're bid to the spiritual Feast of the
[1:16] Lord he's calling us to come and feast
[1:19] on his word let's go now to page 12
[1:23] paragraph
[1:28] 53 he says look at our religious system
[1:31] today how can it be that the churches
[1:34] can ever get into the condition that
[1:35] they are now so that's the question how
[1:39] is it that the churches can get into the
[1:41] condition they are now he says is
[1:43] because they rejected and refused the
[1:45] message of God the invitation to come to
[1:49] the feast so what is the message of God
[1:51] it's the invitation to come to the feast
[1:54] so how did the churches get into the
[1:55] condition they are now is because they
[1:57] refused the message of God the
[1:59] invitation to the feast they rejected it
[2:02] and he says could you call a life like
[2:05] that worthy of the Gospel what what kind
[2:08] of Life the one who refuses the
[2:11] invitation to the feast is not worthy of
[2:13] the
[2:15] Gospel he's not then he goes on and he
[2:17] talks about going to the Ball Game and
[2:19] seeing the pastor smoking and and the
[2:21] Baptist Church that lets out listen the
[2:24] problem wasn't the smoking that was the
[2:26] indication that the life had left the
[2:28] church and why were they in that
[2:30] condition they refuse to accept the
[2:32] invitation of the Lord the message of
[2:34] God and because they refused it
[2:36] somewhere longay they find it in a
[2:38] condition brother brandom's not saying
[2:40] because you smoke you're not worthy of
[2:41] the Gospel he says no you smoke because
[2:43] you rejected the gospel and rejecting
[2:44] The Gospel made you Unworthy of the
[2:46] Gospel this is just the outcropping of
[2:49] it this is just the effect that it has
[2:51] so but if if we go through the we're
[2:53] going to go through this entire message
[2:54] but I want you to keep that in your mind
[2:56] brother brandham is not saying your
[2:58] sinful acts make you unworthy worthy of
[3:00] the Gospel he's saying rejecting the
[3:02] message of your hour makes you Unworthy
[3:04] of the gospel and then you have no place
[3:06] to go but into this downward spiral
[3:08] Spiral of
[3:10] immorality so it's not doing good versus
[3:12] not doing good that's not what he's
[3:14] talking about it's accepting the word or
[3:16] rejecting the word that's really what
[3:18] he's talking about
