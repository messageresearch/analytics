[1:25] nothing oh God let us go back to the
[1:28] beginning let's go back when we were
[1:30] lost in darkness and didn't know
[1:31] anything and barely knew the scriptures
[1:33] and we're so proud that we had memorized
[1:35] the Ten Commandments and so proud that
[1:37] we knew our Bibles books in order and so
[1:39] proud of ourselves for going to church
[1:41] and attending Sunday school and then
[1:43] come along and the light flashes and we
[1:45] realize I don't know my Bible I don't
[1:47] know any scriptures I don't know

[1:59] greatest or the lowest I just want to
[2:02] hear his voice again I just want to come
[2:04] into His presence one more time I just
[2:06] want to jump out of my sorry condition
[2:08] in my boat and I want to swim to him
[2:11] naked with
[2:12] [Music]
[2:15] nothing and just sit at his feet and
[2:18] just listen to him talk
[2:20] again go back to where playing a tape is
[2:23] the most exciting thing that we can do

[2:38] everybody and we assumed everybody in
[2:40] the seat next to us was an
[2:44] angel let's go back to that
