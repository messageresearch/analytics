[6:35] Lord
[6:37] God
[6:40] Almighty who reigns
[6:47] [Music]
[6:55] forever I was like a
[7:00] sheep I had
[7:03] gone
[7:06] astray I
[7:07] wonder so
[7:10] far away from the
[7:16] F plunging
[7:19] deep in
[7:21] sin
[7:23] fulfilling the desires of the
[7:28] flesh but but because I was one of God
[7:34] sheep I was so
[7:37] miserable wandering
[7:43] around but I could not find my way
[7:48] back to
[7:52] God thank
[7:55] God he came me looking for one of his
[7:59] lost sheep and he put
[8:03] me back
[8:05] into the
[8:09] F
[8:11] Lord I'll go where you want me to
[8:18] go show me
[8:20] where you'd have me to
[8:25] [Music]
[8:27] go for my desire
[8:31] is to
[8:33] feed your
[8:37] sheep we read of
[8:40] Simon Peter of
[8:43] old Jesus asked
[8:46] him lovest thou
[8:49] me Peter
[8:51] said Lord you
[8:54] know that I love thee
[9:00] and Jesus
[9:02] answered
[9:04] feed my
[9:09] land then Jesus asked him two more
[9:15] times
[9:17] Simon love Sal
[9:21] me
[9:23] Simon been
[9:26] grieved because he asked him
[9:30] three
[9:32] times he turned
[9:35] to the
[9:37] Lord and he
[9:41] said Lord thou
[9:44] knowest all things you know I love
[9:52] thee Jesus
[9:55] answered
[9:57] feed my sheep
[10:03] Lord I'll go where you want me to
[10:10] go show me where you'd have
[10:16] me to
[10:20] be for my
[10:23] desire is to
[10:26] feed your sheep
[10:30] [Music]
[10:31] though we be a child of
[10:35] God if we're not
[10:38] walking in the
[10:41] center of God's will for our
[10:47] life our hearts will condemn us and we
[10:53] cannot
[10:54] have peace with
[10:57] God so oh then how can we
[11:03] feed God
[11:07] sheep
[11:09] Lord I'll go where you want me to
[11:16] go show me where you'd have me to
[11:24] be for my
[11:27] desire is is to

[11:35] sheep

[15:39] completely dependent upon you and we're

[17:46] appreciative so thankful amen God is

[17:56] we really love you all and appreciate
[17:58] you as Earl so good to us and always so
[18:00] kind we love you all so much amen so for
[18:04] my birthday
[18:06] message I just want to preach the word
[18:08] of God Amen what a privilege to be able
[18:11] to serve God every day of our lives and
[18:13] on this day especially so let's turn to
[18:16] the book of Philippians chapter
[18:20] 3 and uh we'll begin with verse
[18:25] 12 Philippians chapter 3 verse
[18:29] 12 says not as though I have already
[18:32] attained either were already perfect but
[18:34] I follow after if that I may apprehend
[18:37] that for which also I am apprehended of
[18:39] Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself
[18:42] to have apprehended but this one thing I
[18:43] do forgetting those things which are
[18:46] behind and reaching forth in those
[18:47] things which are before I press toward
[18:50] the mark for the prize of the High
[18:52] Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen may
[18:55] God bless us as we look at his word and
[18:57] you can be seated
[18:59] amen I I look at this word press this
[19:03] word press towards the mark of the high
[19:05] calling in and it means metaphorically
[19:08] to pursue to seek after eagerly
[19:11] earnestly Endeavor to acquire so I like
[19:15] that Paul saying here that I'm I'm
[19:18] pressing for something I'm pushing
[19:20] towards something I'm earnestly
[19:22] contending to acquire something so Paul
[19:25] wasn't passive in his desire to serve
[19:28] God or to get all that God had for him
[19:30] or to grow in the all that God wanted
[19:32] him to be it wasn't a passive thing but
[19:34] it was it was a great desire that he had
[19:37] to run the race to press forward to
[19:39] press towards the mark of the high
[19:41] calling in Christ Jesus amen so he was
[19:45] he was admitting I'm not saying I've
[19:47] arrived yet I'm not saying that I'm
[19:48] everything I ought to be or I've come to
[19:50] Perfection amen but this one thing I do
[19:53] laying laying aside everything amen and
[19:56] all the things that are behind me
[19:57] forgetting all of them
[19:59] but reaching forward to that which is
[20:00] forward I press towards the mark of the
[20:02] high calling in Christ Jesus amen so
[20:05] this is such a wonderful attitude and we
[20:07] find this attitude is an important one
[20:09] for us to have too we don't want to be
[20:12] passive or lazy or lethargic in our in
[20:14] our exercise of our
[20:17] faith amen but there's something worth
[20:19] pressing for there's something worth
[20:21] striving for there's something worth
[20:22] giving our lives for there's something
[20:24] worth going the extra effort for
[20:27] amen and and I believe this message is
[20:30] worth it amen so today I've been I've
[20:32] been meditating and studying for a
[20:34] couple days now and I got to the place
[20:36] where I mean so much comes and so many
[20:39] different things and thoughts and they
[20:40] flood through I have no idea what the
[20:42] title is so at the end of it you write
[20:44] whatever you want on the top of your
[20:45] paper but I'm just going to I'm just
[20:47] going to uh uh deliver my heart I have
[20:50] no idea how God will take uh what seems
[20:52] to be jumbled and put it together but
[20:54] I'm not worried about that all I'm
[20:56] worried about is standing here and
[20:57] asking God to come on the scene by the
[20:59] anointing of the Holy Ghost and bring
[21:01] the word the way he wants it brought
[21:03] amen that's my desire above everything
[21:05] else is not to mess up what he wants to
[21:07] do amen and so let's turn to Luke now
[21:11] and look at Luke
[21:17] 16 when it's all over maybe you could
[21:19] text me ideas for a
[21:22] title Luke
[21:27] 16 Luke
[21:31] 1616 Jesus is saying here in Luke 16:16
[21:35] the law and the prophets were until John
[21:38] since that time the kingdom of God is
[21:40] preached and every man presseth into it
[21:44] this word presses is interesting to me
[21:46] because it's a very very aggressive word
[21:50] I mean it's not presses just like we
[21:51] would call it but it means to use force
[21:53] or to apply force or even to inflict
[21:57] violence on this kind kind of press I
[21:59] mean it's a serious pressing Amen to use
[22:03] force or to apply Force so we'll read it
[22:05] again with that in mind the law and the
[22:07] prophets were until John he's just
[22:09] saying the Old Testament was until John
[22:11] amen since that time the kingdom of God
[22:14] is preach and every man presseth into it
[22:17] so once again this is not passive
[22:19] terminology this is not stumbling into
[22:22] or just waiting to see what's going to
[22:24] happen with my life and I hope it all
[22:26] works out and I hope at the end of it
[22:27] all that I find find myself a Christian
[22:29] and that was not the attitude here the
[22:31] attitude is the kingdom is preached and
[22:34] I'm going in me I'm pressing in I'm not
[22:37] going to be left out I'm not going to be
[22:38] left behind if there's a kingdom to have
[22:41] I'm going to have
[22:43] it amen and we realize the truth we
[22:46] understand you know because uh because
[22:49] of the prophetic message we've had in
[22:50] this day God's lifted us up into such a
[22:52] realm of revelation we understand that
[22:55] God forsaw the end from the beginning he
[22:57] knew the end from in the beginning he
[22:59] for ordained what would happen he knew
[23:01] who would receive it and who would not
[23:03] receive it he knew who the elect were
[23:04] and wrote them in the Lamb's Book of
[23:06] Life before the foundation of the world
[23:08] and he knows where he's going to drop a
[23:09] seed of faith and he knows where that
[23:11] seed of faith will come to life amen and
[23:14] we know all things work together for the
[23:15] good and we know God's in control of all
[23:17] things that
[23:20] right
[23:21] amen but I don't believe that Revelation
[23:25] at all should take away a fervent desire
[23:27] in our heart to have everything God has
[23:29] for us I don't believe that Revelation
[23:31] that Revelation come to take away fear
[23:35] fear that I won't make it fear amen fear
[23:38] that I'm not part of it fear that I'll
[23:39] be left out fear that I'll be uh
[23:41] reprobate and left to the side at the
[23:43] end of The Journey amen all that fear
[23:45] can go away by the predestinated plan of
[23:47] God that God foresaw and fornew but I
[23:50] don't think at all in a genuine life of
[23:52] a Christian amen that that seed that's
[23:55] inside of us I don't believe is passive
[23:57] and leth argic and lazy and and not
[24:00] contending but I believe that portion of
[24:02] God that's within us has is reaching up
[24:05] and saying I want that I'm going to have
[24:07] it I'm part of it it's for
[24:10] me amen it's a magnetism amen between
[24:14] the word that is in us and the word
[24:16] that's being preached amen and it's a
[24:18] and it's an attraction one to another
[24:20] and it's it's not this uh this this
[24:23] revelation we have this overarching
[24:25] Revelation well whatever it will be will
[24:27] be I'm not going to worry about it I'm
[24:29] just going to sit here in my seat and if
[24:30] God wants me to do something or if God
[24:32] wants me to be something he'll make me
[24:36] that you know that's
[24:39] true that's
[24:41] true but it's not going to happen
[24:43] exactly like
[24:46] that eventually we're going to get into
[24:48] the situation when we're pressing when
[24:50] we come into desperation when the wheels
[24:52] come off the bus when everything in life
[24:54] falls apart amen we're going to press
[24:56] our way in
[24:58] amen so so this this terminology is
[25:04] aggressive and praise
[25:06] God it's aggressive let's go to Genesis
[25:23] 32 Genesis CH
[25:26] 32 and I'd like to read from verse
[25:29] 24 we know this well I'm just going to
[25:31] read this quickly to refresh us on the
[25:35] word the wording but this is where Jacob
[25:37] wrestles with the angel and it's when
[25:39] he's coming back into the lamb and in
[25:42] Genesis 32:24 he says and Jacob was left
[25:44] alone and there Wrestled a man with him
[25:47] until the break of day and when he saw
[25:49] that he prevailed not against him he
[25:51] touched the hollow of his thigh and the
[25:53] hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint
[25:55] as he wrestled with him and he said let
[25:57] me go for the day breakthe will not let
[26:00] thee go except thou bless me praise be
[26:03] to God I love this I love this this is
[26:06] also
[26:08] aggressive amen he he he later says he
[26:11] calls the place Pineo because he met God
[26:13] face to face so he knows who he's
[26:16] wrestling with he's wrestling with an
[26:17] angel of the Lord which he says he met
[26:19] God face to face and this Angel of the
[26:22] Lord is saying let me go and Jacob has
[26:25] the tenacity to said I will not let you
[26:27] go and unless you bless me amen and what
[26:30] made what made Jacob so desperate it
[26:32] might have been the situation he found
[26:34] himself in amen he was moving back into
[26:36] the land he had he had cheated his
[26:39] brother out out of so many things and
[26:41] his brother was angry and now he's
[26:42] fearful for his life he had Laban before
[26:44] this chasing him because of the way he
[26:46] snuck out from laan and and now his
[26:48] brother's coming against him and his
[26:50] life is in turmoil and now he doesn't
[26:52] know what's going to happen tomorrow
[26:54] when he meets his brother he he he's now
[26:56] separating and dividing his flocks and
[26:58] his herds and his wife and his children
[27:00] and now he himself is all alone amen and
[27:03] the angel of the Lord comes to wrestle
[27:05] with him and I love this because the
[27:07] angel of the Lord doesn't come down and
[27:09] and come to Jacob and say Jacob now I
[27:11] know you're having a hard time and
[27:13] you're so weary and I felt so sorry for
[27:15] you I thought I would come down and
[27:16] encourage you amen I don't know what the
[27:19] conversation was like if there was any
[27:21] conversation but it started into a
[27:23] wrestling match
[27:26] [Applause]
[27:28] I don't know if any words were exchanged
[27:30] we have nothing recorded I don't even
[27:32] know how they got into this wrestling
[27:34] match you can only use your imagination
[27:36] but but at some point this Angel of the
[27:38] Lord tells Jacob let me go you let me go
[27:42] and and and he says God met him face to
[27:45] face so God tells Jacob let me
[27:48] go I preached this before and you might
[27:50] remember but my personal feeling is God
[27:53] was saying out of his mouth let me go
[27:55] but in his heart he was saying don't let
[27:57] me go
[27:58] [Applause]
[27:59] he was testing Jacob this is Jacob's
[28:02] test amen he's proving him amen and
[28:04] listen Jacob was predestinated before
[28:07] the foundation of the world he was in
[28:08] the right lineage the promise was his
[28:10] the birthright was his the blessing was
[28:12] his God had met him on his way out of
[28:15] town when he was in bethl and in a dream
[28:17] he saw God and God promised I will be
[28:19] with you I'm not going to leave you
[28:21] until I bring you back to this place and
[28:23] fulfill everything he had a promise of
[28:25] God but that promise of God didn't allow
[28:28] him to Coast through life but it was
[28:30] full of Trials and pressings and T and
[28:32] temptations and all kinds of difficult
[28:35] circumstances till he gets pressed into
[28:37] this difficult circumstance and God
[28:39] comes and God doesn't make it easy on
[28:42] him God wrestles with
[28:45] him and says let me
[28:49] go oh
[28:51] my it's amazing how uh how this idea
[28:57] this this concept this idea that I'm
[28:59] dwelling on is all through the scripture
[29:01] remember Jesus tells the parable the
[29:04] story of the unjust judge and the widow
[29:07] woman now now
[29:09] listen the just in our Pious
[29:14] Christian whatever religious piety you
[29:18] would think that that you know Jesus
[29:23] wouldn't use this kind of
[29:25] story where there's an unjust judge and
[29:27] a widow and she's desperate and she
[29:29] needs to be Avenged and the only one
[29:30] that can avenge her is this judge and
[29:32] she comes to the judge and the judge
[29:34] won't avenge her he won't give her what
[29:36] she's asking for but she won't quit she
[29:38] keeps knocking she keeps harassing she
[29:40] keeps she won't take no for an
[29:46] answer and Jesus is the one who tells
[29:49] this this story and he tells it to his
[29:52] disciples and then he uses as an example
[29:55] of how we amen should approach unto God
[29:58] yes and and now all of the sudden what
[30:02] you mean you mean I'm not supposed to
[30:03] take no for an answer amen listen I
[30:07] don't I don't know how to qualify this
[30:09] in my religious mind amen I don't know
[30:12] how to do this but all I know there was
[30:13] a desperation in that woman and God's
[30:16] pointing to a desperation in his child
[30:18] he doesn't always make it easy sometimes
[30:20] he says no amen just to see what you're
[30:23] going to do about it to see what the
[30:25] faith is down inside of you is there any
[30:28] tenacity is there any fight amen is
[30:30] there any strive is there any grit is
[30:32] there anything that matches his nature
[30:35] that's not going to give up on the word
[30:36] of God that's not going to roll over and
[30:38] die that's not going to capitulate to
[30:40] the to the winning of Satan but it's
[30:42] going to say this is the word you've
[30:44] promised it to me and I've got a right
[30:47] for
[30:49] it amen I listen it's Jesus who told the
[30:53] story it's Jesus who used the example I
[30:56] can't even tell you all the appropriate
[30:58] applications because there's times where
[31:00] Jesus will tell you no and you must
[31:02] accept as
[31:03] no but there also may be times where
[31:06] Jesus tells you no and and you're not
[31:08] supposed to accept as
[31:12] no I I cannot qualify that in my brain
[31:16] neither can I give you enough examples
[31:17] for you to sort it out but there's got
[31:19] to be something down inside of you that
[31:22] sometimes won't take no for an answer
[31:24] and God will be pleased with it
[31:28] yeah he was so pleased with Jacob that
[31:31] he changed his name from Jacob to Israel
[31:34] amen because Israel means strength
[31:36] because he's because the Bible says that
[31:38] he prevailed over the angelise the Lord
[31:42] and he had power with man and with
[31:48] God I think God was proud of his
[31:52] son
[31:55] amen so please don't ask me brother Tad
[31:58] when should I take no for and when
[32:00] should I not take no I don't
[32:03] know I don't even know how to sort this
[32:05] out of myself all I know is there's
[32:07] times desperation strikes to say I've
[32:09] have no choice godone there's nothing
[32:11] else will work I've got to have you come
[32:13] on the scene for this I've got to have
[32:15] an answer I've got to have Deliverance I
[32:17] can't live like this anymore I can't
[32:19] take it anymore and I can't give up on
[32:21] my children I can't give up on my wife I
[32:23] can't give up on my brother I can't give
[32:25] up on myself being delivered amen amen
[32:30] Amen brother Brenham says in the
[32:32] unchangeable God so the main thing
[32:35] was that Jacob he had a dream he had
[32:38] dreams and visions and so forth but this
[32:41] was one time he could lay his hand on
[32:43] something and say it's
[32:44] God and he was able to hold on to it
[32:47] until the blessing come oh if we could
[32:49] do that if we could find a spot to where
[32:52] we could see God whether it's in his
[32:53] word whether it's wherever it is and
[32:56] recognize it's God God and hold on to it
[32:59] until the blessing comes wrestle it out
[33:01] with God God promised to do it God said
[33:05] if we'd seek we would find ask it' be
[33:08] given knock it'll be open every word is
[33:11] true when Jacob got a hold of something
[33:13] that he could look at and hold on to
[33:15] with his hands and seeing that it was
[33:17] God he would not turn it
[33:21] loose Hey listen this message is God
[33:25] don't turn it loose the word of God is
[33:27] true don't turn it loose for anything no
[33:30] matter what and I wonder sometimes if
[33:32] God won't just every once in a while
[33:34] take this message take his word take
[33:37] take our life and just shake it real
[33:38] good one time just to see how strong a
[33:41] hold we have on
[33:43] it amen you ever had your world rocked
[33:46] amen you ever had I mean I'm talking
[33:48] about in the truth of the hour you ever
[33:50] had somebody you love walk away from the
[33:52] truth amen somebody denounce it somebody
[33:54] amen not believe anymore amen maybe God
[33:57] will just take the this word that you're
[33:59] holding on to and shake it real hard one
[34:01] time to see if he can get it away from
[34:03] you you say God wouldn't do that maybe
[34:06] he
[34:07] would maybe that's exactly what he would
[34:10] do amen why because he's looking for
[34:13] sons and daughter somebody that has his
[34:15] nature amen that's not the shaking off
[34:17] kind amen he's looking for those that
[34:19] are magnetized through the word and
[34:21] can't be shaken off not because of
[34:23] themselves or because of their own
[34:25] strength they can't be shaken off
[34:27] because there's something something
[34:28] inside of them that won't let go of this
[34:30] word it's God holding on to God Amen
[34:33] it's not it's not you holding onto God
[34:36] it's what God placed inside of you what
[34:39] he put in your soul before the
[34:40] foundation of the world that's come to
[34:42] life under this word it won't let go
[34:44] because it's God holding
[34:47] God Amen who was it that was facing off
[34:51] with God and standing in the gap for the
[34:53] children of Israel when they moved to
[34:55] idolatry when Abra when Moses was up on
[34:57] the up on the mountain amen and all of a
[35:00] sudden they moved to idolatry and now
[35:03] amen God was going to wipe them off and
[35:04] he said Moses amen you move to the side
[35:07] I'm going to WIP and Moses stood in the
[35:10] Gap and said don't do it Lord don't do
[35:14] it block my name not theirs and brother
[35:16] benam said and in the and the Bible said
[35:18] and God repented of the evil he thought
[35:20] towards
[35:22] Israel and brother R was troubled with
[35:24] that how could a man have a better idea
[35:26] than God had and said then I realized it
[35:29] was Christ in Moses that wasn't the man
[35:32] that was the God and the man it was God
[35:35] talking to
[35:38] God Amen maybe what God's looking for is
[35:42] the other part of himself amen the other
[35:45] half of the Chinese ticket maybe he's
[35:47] looking for somebody that has his
[35:48] character his nature his desire his love
[35:50] for the
[35:53] word hallelujah man yeah sometimes we
[35:56] get so confused in our Lives why is it
[35:58] so hard why such shaking why one thing
[36:01] after
[36:03] another that's
[36:05] where that's where Jacob was trouble
[36:09] after trouble after
[36:11] trouble and I can just imagine God
[36:14] saying I'm going to go see what's inside
[36:17] that
[36:18] [Laughter]
[36:21] boy
[36:23] amen maybe it wasn't that Jacob needed
[36:26] this maybe it wasn't that God needed to
[36:28] see what was in Jacob maybe Jacob needed
[36:30] to see what was in
[36:33] Jacob you know a faith that can't be
[36:35] tested can't be
[36:38] trusted sometimes we think we believe
[36:41] something and we do to the best of our
[36:43] ability but how are you going to rest on
[36:45] it till it's been tested till you almost
[36:48] lost it till there was nothing else that
[36:50] would hold on but faith and then that
[36:52] Faith was tested and went through the
[36:54] refiner fire and you found out that was
[36:55] a gift of God that wasn't human faith it
[36:59] wasn't intellectual faith that was faith
[37:01] that came from God because it held
[37:02] through it
[37:04] all maybe God doesn't do that for his
[37:07] benefit but maybe he does it for
[37:11] ours
[37:13] amen let's go to 1 Timothy chapter
[37:25] 6 1 Timothy chapter
[37:30] 6 in verse 12 Paul tells Timothy fight
[37:34] the good fight of Faith lay hold on
[37:37] eternal life one to thou where unto Thou
[37:41] Art also called and Hast professed a
[37:43] good profession before many
[37:46] witnesses I mean this this idea this
[37:49] concept this thought is all through the
[37:53] scriptures fight the good fight of Faith
[37:57] you mean faith is a
[38:00] fight faith is a fight maybe you have to
[38:03] fight for it maybe it's worth fighting
[38:06] for fight the good fight of faith and
[38:09] lay hold on eternal life that means
[38:11] acquire it grip it grab a hold of
[38:13] it again not passive terminology Paul is
[38:17] not in any way inferring here and the
[38:19] Bible's not any way inferring that all
[38:21] you have to do is come to church to the
[38:23] right kind of church that preaches the
[38:25] right kind of word and you sit there
[38:26] until you get the cold like everybody
[38:28] else got the
[38:30] cold it doesn't come that way the
[38:33] kingdom of God is
[38:35] preached and they presseth into it
[38:38] amen amen that's not what God's looking
[38:41] for God's looking for somebody will'll
[38:43] say that's nothing but the truth amen
[38:48] and I've got to have it in my
[38:52] life brother M says in the message the
[38:55] marriage of the Lamb so the same way it
[38:57] is about Divine Healing God has got the
[39:00] power to heal you if you've got the
[39:02] courage to accept it but you'll fight
[39:05] every inch of the
[39:07] way God has got Amazing Grace to save
[39:10] you and he will do it but you'll fight
[39:12] every inch of your way that's an amazing
[39:15] statement uh God has amazing grace to
[39:18] save you he's talking about your
[39:20] salvation and he will but you'll fight
[39:23] every inch of your way
[39:25] amen he said now he said I've been
[39:28] behind the pull pit going on 31 years
[39:30] and every inch of that has been a fight
[39:33] constantly it certainly has but we must
[39:37] fight if we must Reign so we find out
[39:39] that the bride has to make herself ready
[39:41] be willing to lay aside every weight
[39:43] that does so easily beset us that we
[39:45] might run with patience the race that is
[39:47] set before us we must lay them aside
[39:50] ourself we can't say godone you come lay
[39:52] them aside for us we got to do that
[39:55] ourselves so there's a good fight of
[39:57] Faith there's something to apprehend but
[39:59] there's there's also something to fight
[40:00] against and that's
[40:02] ourselves and God wants us to do that
[40:05] amen he wants us to to bring this body
[40:07] subject let's look at this in 1
[40:09] Corinthians
[40:11] 9 1 Corinthians chapter 9 where Paul
[40:14] goes into
[40:16] this in verse
[40:22] 24 it says know you not that they which
[40:25] run in a race run all but one receiveth
[40:28] the prize so run that you may obtain
[40:32] already we're back in nonp passive
[40:35] terminology amen he's talking about
[40:38] striving running and not running just to
[40:40] keep Pace running to
[40:43] win right so this is not passive this is
[40:46] not a passive approach to the gospel or
[40:48] living the life amen but there's a
[40:50] there's a contending an effort a
[40:52] striving a a reaching forth and so let's
[40:56] read this again he says no you not that
[40:57] they which run in a race run all but one
[40:59] receiveth the prize so run that ye may
[41:02] obtain and every man that striveth for
[41:04] Mastery is tempered in all things now
[41:07] they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown
[41:09] but we an Incorruptible I therefore so
[41:12] run not as uncertain so fight I not as
[41:14] one that beateth the air but I keep
[41:16] under my body and bring it into
[41:18] subjection lest that by any means when I
[41:20] have preached to others I myself should
[41:22] be a cast away so now we want to look at
[41:26] the good fight of faith and this way
[41:28] when Paul was fighting the good fight of
[41:30] faith and in that good fight of Faith he
[41:33] has to bring his body subject so that it
[41:35] doesn't hinder him in his running the
[41:38] race he has to be temperate and moderate
[41:41] and have self-control over himself and
[41:43] bring this body subject to the word of
[41:45] God why so that he where's his
[41:50] fight right
[41:54] here and it this terminology doesn't
[41:56] sound
[41:58] compassive because he says when I keep
[42:00] under my body that word keep under means
[42:02] to beat black and
[42:05] blue also not a passive statement he's
[42:09] not passively allowing the dictates of
[42:11] the flesh to take him wherever he wants
[42:13] but he's actively taking dominion over
[42:15] the flesh
[42:17] aggressively that's the terminology we
[42:19] got he's serious about this and he's
[42:22] aggressive about it he's not passive
[42:24] about it but he's not going to let
[42:26] himself trip himself up and he's not
[42:28] going to let himself hinder himself from
[42:31] getting the
[42:33] prize amen and he and he types it with
[42:36] an athlete which has to do the same
[42:38] thing if the athlete wants to win the
[42:39] prize he's got to bring this body
[42:41] subject to the desire he has inside to
[42:43] win the prize and we've got to do the
[42:46] same thing we've got to bring this flesh
[42:48] amen subject to the desire on the inside
[42:51] to win the
[42:52] race praise God brother brandham says it
[42:56] this way and 1963 in the message
[42:58] accepting God's provided way at the end
[43:00] time says cry for your needs that's
[43:03] God's provided way didn't Jesus explain
[43:06] it when he said the unjust judge to the
[43:08] woman that cried day and night how much
[43:10] more will the heavenly father give them
[43:12] the spirit who cry out for it day and
[43:14] night seek keep
[43:17] seeking knock keep
[43:20] knocking when the scripture says seek
[43:22] and you shall find knock and the door
[43:24] will be open when when it says seek amen
[43:28] that is that that is a word amen seek or
[43:31] knock that has no definitive Tim stamp
[43:35] to
[43:36] it seek and you shall find so how long
[43:41] should I seek till you find amen amen
[43:44] knock knock is
[43:49] not but knock is active knock brother
[43:53] say keep knocking says knock and the
[43:55] door will be open so so how long do I
[43:57] keep knocking till the door is open seek
[44:01] and you shall find knock and the door
[44:02] will be open this is not a this not a
[44:05] one-time temporary kind of thing this is
[44:08] a an
[44:11] until
[44:13] amen amen seek keep seeking knock keep
[44:16] knocking just keep on till he opens stay
[44:18] out with it cry until the promised word
[44:20] is Vindicated then you got it you don't
[44:23] have to worry no more you see the Bible
[44:25] promised it then stay right there and
[44:27] cry until you get it if if a little baby
[44:30] sees a cooking now listen to what
[44:32] brother b i I thought uh I thought the
[44:35] the analogy the story Jesus used of the
[44:38] unjust judge and the Widow I thought
[44:39] that was a little bit extreme but but
[44:41] now brother brandom's going to bring a
[44:42] parable
[44:43] in the little baby sees a cookie and he
[44:46] wants it he just cry and cry and cry and
[44:48] stick and kick and scream and holler and
[44:51] turn red in the face
[44:59] my religious piety doesn't allow me to
[45:01] talk this
[45:06] way he turned red in the face his mommy
[45:09] getting a him a cookie and it's all over
[45:12] and he got what he saw what he wanted if
[45:14] he wants to lick off your ice cream cone
[45:16] he'll just keep raising a fuss till he
[45:18] gets
[45:19] it well that's the way we're supposed to
[45:24] do this is a prophet of God speaking to
[45:27] us here I mean he he has some
[45:29] understanding on what he's talking about
[45:31] and and and I'm thinking I mean you're
[45:33] using the analogy of a baby throwing an
[45:36] absolute Hissy Fit until he gets what he
[45:39] wants and he's pacified and and and and
[45:41] he wants your ice cream and he will kick
[45:43] up a fuss to you give it to him he said
[45:45] that's what we're supposed to
[45:48] do oh my goodness I'm glad I can read
[45:51] quotes cuz if I tried preaching like
[45:53] that you'd be like brother Chad now
[46:01] should we really talk to God like that
[46:03] should we really shouldn't we just
[46:05] accept whatever he allows and that's not
[46:09] what the prophet taught us that's not
[46:10] what Paul taught us that's not what the
[46:11] scriptures are showing
[46:13] us praise the
[46:15] Lord
[46:17] amen he said
[46:19] now that's the way we're supposed to do
[46:22] if we see a promise in the Bible that's
[46:25] God's word then I just stay stay there
[46:27] and cry out till God gives it to me and
[46:30] he do that now listen he do that to get
[46:34] you off his
[46:38] hands you see that would be in the
[46:41] natural but he's wanting you to do it he
[46:44] likes for you to ask ask abundantly that
[46:47] your Joys might be full he said cry
[46:50] until his word is Vindicated now friend
[46:52] let's watch just a minute now cry until
[46:54] the word is Vindicated the trouble of it
[46:56] is we get a cookie and think that's all
[46:59] there is there's a whole table full we
[47:01] get so we can speak in tongues we say oh
[47:03] brother that's it oh no that ain't
[47:05] that's just some of it that's right oh I
[47:07] I got happy enough to shout that's some
[47:10] more of it but there's a whole lot more
[47:12] of it just keep on crying until that's
[47:15] God's provided way for his people God's
[47:17] provided way always is to take his word
[47:20] and hold onto it until it's Vindicated
[47:23] to you so what is God's way God's Prov
[47:26] by way is always is to take his word and
[47:30] hold on to it until it's Vindicated to
[47:34] you now do you follow me God a provided
[47:37] way hold on to the promise Until It's
[47:39] Made manifest to
[47:41] you so that's our
[47:44] instructions how long until amen seek
[47:48] and you shall find knock and the door
[47:50] will be open
[47:52] amen and remember I'm on record for this
[47:56] that any promise of God in the Bible
[47:59] it's on conditions now just because you
[48:02] believe it's there that don't make it so
[48:04] it'll happen them Pharisees and
[48:06] Sadducees was just as religious with
[48:08] those sacraments as they could be but
[48:09] God said they'd stink in his nose there
[48:12] was no sincerity there was nothing to it
[48:14] that should be you've got to come upon
[48:17] basic promise and then upon your mental
[48:21] attitude towards
[48:22] it amen this is what I believe that the
[48:26] prophet teaching Us in the Bible showing
[48:28] us this is what this is what I'm
[48:29] Desiring to share amen when we take a
[48:32] passive
[48:34] approach when we are just super
[48:37] contented with whatever and we're living
[48:39] below our Privileges and and things that
[48:42] that are promised to us we're not
[48:43] attaining for and we're not looking to
[48:46] grow amen spiritually we're not looking
[48:48] to overcome to be delivered to have to
[48:51] have our family delivered these things
[48:53] that we just settle down and accept and
[48:54] be too contented it shows the wrong
[48:57] attitude towards the word of God that's
[49:00] the real problem that we get to it shows
[49:04] there's not a fervent desire to have all
[49:06] there's not a fervent desire to be
[49:08] delivered we get to some state of just
[49:11] being being able to maintain we got to a
[49:13] certain position where now everything's
[49:15] controllable and okay and we quit
[49:17] striving we quit pressing but that's not
[49:19] all friends there's more there's a
[49:21] Deliverance amen there's Freedom there's
[49:23] Victory there's souls to be saved
[49:25] there's our body IES to be changed for
[49:27] our atoms to change in a moment and
[49:29] twinkling of an eye there's no place to
[49:31] stop and settle down but keep on
[49:33] pressing and keep on pressing to Higher
[49:38] Ground amen and and
[49:40] so to me sometimes the problem is our
[49:45] lethargy and our our
[49:47] complacency is showing a wrong mental
[49:52] attitude because it comes from a lack of
[49:54] desperation
[49:57] yes because we're
[50:01] okay amen am and the reality is God's
[50:05] been good to us friends he's been you
[50:07] look all around God's been so good to us
[50:10] we've been so blessed in our families
[50:12] and in our church and in our health and
[50:14] we've been so blessed in so many ways
[50:16] but God helped me not to be complacent
[50:18] with part of the word when the full
[50:20] measure of Christ has been made
[50:22] available in today and everything he
[50:25] promised is available and I can live the
[50:27] life of Jesus Christ if I'll keep
[50:29] pressing and he'll keep working inside
[50:30] of me and I can have all the promises
[50:32] fulfilled in my life God forbid that I
[50:35] would become complacent in the day when
[50:37] everything's
[50:39] available help me God it's all I can say
[50:43] is help me
[50:44] God
[50:47] Amen now when we talk about the right
[50:52] mental
[50:53] attitude brother B says there's a
[50:55] there's a mental attitude towards the
[50:56] things of gone and it he says it's it's
[51:00] actually required for the Fulfillment of
[51:02] the word you have to have the right
[51:04] attitude towards it in the message the
[51:07] greatest battle ever fought he said when
[51:10] this great battle started on Earth there
[51:12] had to be a mutual meeting place there
[51:14] had to be a place selected for the
[51:16] battle to begin and for the battle to
[51:17] rage and that Battlegrounds begin in the
[51:20] human mind there is where the battle
[51:23] starts the human mind was chosen for the
[51:25] place of the battle where it was begin
[51:28] and that is because that decisions are
[51:29] made from the mind and head now they
[51:32] never started in from some organ
[51:34] organization they never started in from
[51:36] some mechanical Affair the grounds never
[51:38] started there therefore that
[51:40] organization can never never do the work
[51:43] of God because the Battlegrounds where
[51:45] you got to meet your enemy is in the
[51:47] mind you've got to make your choice it
[51:50] meets
[51:51] you now we're going to look at the good
[51:54] fight of faith
[51:56] amen contending for the faith pressing
[52:00] into the
[52:01] kingdom fighting laying hold of all of
[52:05] these things we we've turned and and
[52:06] then Paul starts talking about uh uh
[52:09] being tempered in all things and having
[52:11] control over his own body and and we
[52:14] realize now that my enemy is me what I'm
[52:18] fighting is
[52:20] me but the battle now is in my
[52:24] mind and it's going to require ire to F
[52:27] see the Fulfillment of the promises of
[52:29] God is going to require my faith in the
[52:31] promise and my right mental attitude
[52:32] towards
[52:34] it amen but where am I going to have to
[52:37] win the battle I'm going to have to win
[52:38] it in the
[52:39] mind because what's affecting my mental
[52:42] attitude towards the word something in
[52:44] my
[52:45] mind
[52:47] amen amen when we don't know where the
[52:50] Warfare is amen we then we want to fight
[52:52] everything around us listen if you can
[52:54] if you and I can win the battle in our
[52:56] mind we
[52:58] win amen we win because the battle has
[53:01] moved to the battleground of our mind
[53:03] and if we can take the word of God by
[53:04] faith and win the battle in our mind
[53:07] amen we win the fight amen it's not
[53:09] what's going on out here that keeps us
[53:11] defeated it's what's going on in here
[53:13] that keeps us
[53:14] defeated amen so the Battleground is in
[53:16] us and we have to understand that that
[53:19] God is looking amen for the right mental
[53:21] attitude to be expressed and for the
[53:23] right mental attitude to be expressed
[53:25] amen I've got to win the battle in my
[53:27] mind amen praise
[53:30] God this is why this is Brother B said
[53:33] this is a neurotic age amen this is the
[53:35] age where the battle is taking place
[53:37] between our ears this isn't the age
[53:39] where they're hauling us to prison and
[53:40] we're being stoned for our faith amen
[53:42] and we're persecuted and run from City
[53:44] to City it's amazing how we can be
[53:46] fighting a spiritual battle amen that's
[53:49] absolutely crippling us when we have the
[53:51] we have freedom to come to church
[53:53] whenever we want and worship the way we
[53:54] want and sing what we want and do
[53:56] whatever we want we have absolute
[53:58] Liberty to live this message to its
[54:02] fullness so our battle is not external
[54:06] now our battle is
[54:08] internal because the external battle and
[54:11] that doesn't mean we're not going to
[54:12] have a squeeze or a press at the very
[54:14] end the prophet talked about that but
[54:16] that's not what's going on right now
[54:18] right now there's still a battle and the
[54:20] battle is not being imprisoned by the
[54:22] Roman government the battle is being
[54:23] imprisoned in my mind with wrong
[54:25] thinking
[54:27] with complexes and self-doubt and all
[54:29] kinds of fear and anxiety and all the
[54:31] things that the devil's trying to put
[54:33] into our mind to what to inhibit us from
[54:36] having the right attitude towards the
[54:37] word because the right attitude will
[54:39] bring the promise to pass so the fight
[54:42] is in the mind Amen to inhibit me in the
[54:45] expression of my attitude towards the
[54:49] word
[54:51] amen amen praise God you know there's
[54:54] been no age free from a battle
[54:59] when we have so much Liberty and freedom
[55:01] and and and wealth and all the things
[55:03] that we need to serve God according to
[55:05] his
[55:06] word there's no age free from a battle
[55:10] so God gives us freedom and liberty and
[55:12] finances and but then puts us in a
[55:15] neurotic
[55:16] age where everything around us is a lie
[55:19] selling us a lie and tormenting our
[55:21] minds polluting and corrupting our minds
[55:24] amen so we have to win the battle in the
[55:26] the
[55:27] Mind
[55:29] Amen brother B says uh now the right
[55:33] mental attitude all you along here do
[55:35] you understand what I mean when I say
[55:36] the right mental attitude your right
[55:39] mental attitude towards God's Divine
[55:41] promise will bring any promise to pass
[55:45] yes amen this is why we cannot be
[55:48] complacent this is why the terminology
[55:50] that we've been reading in the Bible is
[55:53] aggressive because that's the right
[55:55] attitude
[55:57] the right attitude is that land is mine
[56:00] and I'm driving the Philistines off of
[56:02] it that's the right mental attitude
[56:04] that's what the attitude God wanted his
[56:06] children to had when they crossed Jordan
[56:08] he wanted them to have the attitude God
[56:10] gave this land to me it's my land and
[56:12] you've got to go and I'm going to fight
[56:14] you till you're gone and what did he
[56:16] rebuke them for at the end of Judges is
[56:18] because they started to make treaties
[56:20] with all the Canaanites and didn't fully
[56:22] possess the land and he brought a
[56:24] prophet and he used and he used Joshua
[56:27] to bring a rebuke against them and why
[56:29] did you stop why did you quit why didn't
[56:31] you keep pressing what were they showing
[56:33] they were showing the wrong mental
[56:35] attitude towards the promise of God cuz
[56:37] the promise of God was the full
[56:40] inheritance and when they got a degree
[56:43] of peace and comfort and and and a
[56:45] little bit of easy goinging amen they
[56:47] stopped getting the promise and they
[56:50] settled down to eat
[56:53] corn and corn was their blessing
[56:57] it was the corn of the land the fat of
[56:59] the land that was their blessing they
[57:01] started enjoying the
[57:04] blessing but but and and taking the
[57:07] blessing and putting the Canaanites
[57:09] under
[57:10] tribute is showed the wrong mental
[57:13] attitude towards the word of
[57:15] God and God rebuked him for
[57:19] it remember when the king comes to
[57:23] Elisha when Elisha's dying and he says
[57:26] my father my father the the the horsemen
[57:29] of Israel and the Chariots thereof and
[57:32] and and he said pray that we'll be
[57:33] delivered and I I I don't remember the
[57:35] full context but uh Elisha said take
[57:38] your arrows take your arrow and your bow
[57:40] in your hand and shoot it out the window
[57:41] so shall you be delivered of the syrians
[57:44] now take your arrows and smite them on
[57:45] the ground and he smoted them Thrice and
[57:48] Elisha rebuked him and say why did you
[57:50] only Smite Thrice you should have done
[57:52] at least five or six times then you
[57:53] would have been fully delivered of the
[57:55] cians but now now you're only going to
[57:56] have a partial Victory why because you
[57:59] weren't aggressive enough when your
[58:01] opportunity came to have a promise of
[58:05] God you weren't aggressive enough you
[58:07] didn't want enough you didn't ask enough
[58:09] you didn't push
[58:12] enough listen I don't want I I like I
[58:15] said I don't understand all these things
[58:16] cuz I'm not pushy by Nature amen I'm
[58:19] telling you when somebody cuts in front
[58:20] of me in line somewhere I just say God
[58:22] bless you I mean
[58:24] just I'm not put pushy I'm not
[58:26] aggressive and I don't want to be pushy
[58:28] or aggressive but I'm not about to to
[58:31] miss my privileges anymore I'm not about
[58:34] to stand by amen and miss my opportunity
[58:37] to have the word fulfilled in my life
[58:39] amen remember remember when they had the
[58:42] Fallout with the Tribe of Benjamin
[58:44] because they took the Levites concubine
[58:46] amen and he ended up it was a horrific
[58:47] story end up cutting her into pieces
[58:49] sending it out to the 12 tribes and they
[58:51] went up to destroy Benjamin and they
[58:53] asked God God should we go up against
[58:56] Benjamin or not and God said yes amen
[58:58] they inquired of the uran the thumb and
[59:00] he said yes go they have a direct word
[59:04] of the Lord God said go and defeat
[59:06] Benjamin they went to fight Benjamin
[59:09] defeated them they turned their back and
[59:11] they ran away they lost the
[59:13] battle they
[59:16] lost but God spoke prophetically and
[59:19] told him to
[59:20] go but they
[59:23] lost you talk about a mind battle
[59:27] that would start a bind
[59:29] battle what happened the high priest and
[59:32] the man and thumb and this is what God
[59:33] Said and he told us to go what did we
[59:35] get wrong what did we miss how how did
[59:38] we misinterpret what God what what's
[59:40] what's wrong with us what's wrong
[59:42] well nothing was
[59:45] wrong they went back and inquired again
[59:49] and said oh God we don't know what
[59:50] happened we don't know what's wrong
[59:52] should we go up against Benjamin or we
[59:54] should we stop and he said go up
[59:56] yeah they got the word of the Lord and
[59:59] say okay what whatever we messed up
[1:00:00] before let's not mess it up this
[1:00:03] time they go up and they lose the battle
[1:00:06] a second
[1:00:10] time
[1:00:12] listen the Bible says Elisha was a man
[1:00:15] of like passions as we are brother renam
[1:00:18] come along and he took those Old
[1:00:20] Testament types and told the story in a
[1:00:21] way that made it real to where we can
[1:00:24] enter into the story so let's let enter
[1:00:26] into this story this is you
[1:00:29] now the word of the Lord through God's
[1:00:31] prophetic means has told you to go up
[1:00:33] and you
[1:00:35] lost you did it again you lost now when
[1:00:38] that happened before there was an achin
[1:00:40] in the camp so where's the aen in the
[1:00:41] camp we're all accusing each other
[1:00:45] of but that wasn't the problem this
[1:00:50] time when you read the story apparently
[1:00:52] there's no problem
[1:00:56] they come back now to God a third time
[1:00:58] and say God should should we go up we
[1:01:00] don't know what to do should we go up or
[1:01:02] not he said go
[1:01:03] up they went up to Benjamin that time
[1:01:06] and they wiped him out they defeated
[1:01:07] Benjamin they
[1:01:09] won and you look at this whole story and
[1:01:11] say this whole story is a mess from
[1:01:13] beginning to
[1:01:14] end it is but one thing that we can
[1:01:18] learn from that is whatever God says do
[1:01:21] it regardless of the outcome amen do it
[1:01:24] don't worry about the outcome keep the
[1:01:26] word the outcome is up to God Amen if it
[1:01:29] doesn't work the first time do it again
[1:01:30] if it doesn't work the second time do it
[1:01:32] again do it until God tells you stop or
[1:01:34] you got something wrong or you need to
[1:01:36] change direction but if you're convinced
[1:01:38] it's the word of the Lord if you've got
[1:01:40] confirmation it's the word of the Lord
[1:01:42] then stick with
[1:01:44] it what a lesson God wants a little bit
[1:01:47] of grit some tenacity amen some of his
[1:01:51] nature coming through his
[1:01:54] children amen there's so many things in
[1:01:57] the Bible amen that are far beyond my
[1:01:59] intellectual understanding I would have
[1:02:01] never written the Bible this way and I
[1:02:02] would have never done it that way but we
[1:02:04] come here to the end of time and I say
[1:02:06] I'm so glad God wrote his Bible that way
[1:02:08] I'm so glad he did it that way cuz
[1:02:10] that's my life amen I go to do something
[1:02:12] and apply the word that I am convinced
[1:02:14] is the word it's Vindicated through a
[1:02:16] Vindicated Propet I know it's right and
[1:02:18] I do it and my effort
[1:02:20] fails
[1:02:22] amen I don't get the results I think I
[1:02:25] it it turn turns in a direction I didn't
[1:02:27] expect what am I supposed to do I don't
[1:02:29] believe I'm supposed to take a passive
[1:02:31] approach if it's the word and I'm
[1:02:33] convinced it's the word it's Vindicated
[1:02:35] the word and I believe it's for me then
[1:02:37] maybe I should just try again maybe I
[1:02:39] shouldn't Smite my arrows just three
[1:02:41] times but maybe five or six or seven
[1:02:43] times until I'm fully delivered and
[1:02:45] possess This Promise in my
[1:02:48] hand amen am maybe we're not supposed to
[1:02:53] be so passive when it it comes to the
[1:02:56] promises of God
[1:02:59] Amen the nature of God listen friends is
[1:03:03] so
[1:03:04] Dynamic it's not simplistic it's
[1:03:11] Dynamic you think about Jesus he was the
[1:03:13] Lamb of
[1:03:14] God we talked about this before but the
[1:03:16] Lamb of God when he saw the money
[1:03:18] changers in the temple became
[1:03:20] overwhelmed with Zeal for the temple of
[1:03:22] God became angry platted together a
[1:03:26] whipped the money changers out of the
[1:03:27] temple and threw over their
[1:03:29] tables this is the Lamb of
[1:03:34] God God Is So
[1:03:37] Dynamic the Lord he's full of Mercy but
[1:03:40] he's a
[1:03:42] judge
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:46] uh he's so gentle and so
[1:03:54] aggressive if if I'm going to take the
[1:03:56] nature of Christ it may be more Dynamic
[1:04:00] than we thought maybe there's times to
[1:04:03] be aggressive and there's times to be
[1:04:05] gentle maybe there's times to be a lamb
[1:04:07] and times to be a lion depending on the
[1:04:11] situation and maybe we just need more
[1:04:14] discernment to know when this is time
[1:04:16] this is the word of God friends this is
[1:04:18] the word of God this is a promise and
[1:04:20] this is my need and I can't see any
[1:04:22] other way God I've got to have it
[1:04:25] I don't know that that's displeasing to
[1:04:27] him from what I've been
[1:04:29] reading
[1:04:32] amen
[1:04:33] now I didn't finish this quote but
[1:04:36] brother B says your right mental
[1:04:37] attitude towards God's Divine promise
[1:04:39] will bring any promise to pass now maybe
[1:04:42] you don't believe that you say well my
[1:04:45] faith is weak I wouldn't confess
[1:04:48] it see don't let the devil know that
[1:04:51] always say I've got good faith I believe
[1:04:56] God with all my heart see don't testify
[1:04:58] nothing of the
[1:05:00] devil and when you accept him as your
[1:05:02] healer don't ever act like you're sick
[1:05:04] or crippled anymore believe that you're
[1:05:06] healed take him at his word then it's
[1:05:09] all over on God then and not on you amen
[1:05:13] is that right brother Jim Swanson
[1:05:16] amen amen amen I was trying to get him
[1:05:19] act like he was crippled but he was
[1:05:20] refusing amen he stood up and walked
[1:05:23] when I was telling him not to but he
[1:05:25] believed the promise of
[1:05:27] God Amen so sometimes don't listen to me
[1:05:34] brother he says believe that you're
[1:05:37] healed take him at his word then it's
[1:05:40] all over on God then not on you as long
[1:05:42] as you take God at his word then the
[1:05:44] word will produce what it promised to do
[1:05:46] is that right now have faith believe him
[1:05:49] with all of your
[1:05:51] heart
[1:05:53] now uh we've been talking
[1:05:56] about uh me the right mental attitude
[1:06:00] the the the Battleground in the mind
[1:06:02] because that's the that's the age we
[1:06:04] find ourselves in friends that's where
[1:06:06] we're at it's not so much the physical
[1:06:08] things and we deal with some physical
[1:06:10] things we have some pain and sickness
[1:06:11] and some of these afflictions but really
[1:06:14] I I to me I believe our greatest battle
[1:06:16] is the mind the age that we live in and
[1:06:21] and so we've got to win the battle in
[1:06:23] the mind and brother brm says and in the
[1:06:26] message Hebrews from 1957 in the Hebrew
[1:06:29] series is now only way that a church can
[1:06:30] be built the only way that a command can
[1:06:32] have faith is not by his denominational
[1:06:35] not by his affiliation but his faith
[1:06:38] rests not upon Theology of some man's
[1:06:40] ideas because it's no more less
[1:06:41] altogether man but the only way faith
[1:06:45] can find its solemn resting place is
[1:06:47] upon the immovable and unchangeable word
[1:06:49] of
[1:06:50] God so that's where we have to have
[1:06:52] something to base our faith on and we fa
[1:06:55] base our faith on the word of God we
[1:06:57] can't base it on our emotions our
[1:06:59] feelings our thoughts our our we can't
[1:07:01] base it off any of that because those
[1:07:03] things change all the time so we have to
[1:07:05] have a basis for our faith to start
[1:07:06] first and and our basis is on the
[1:07:08] unmovable and unchangeable word of
[1:07:12] God then he says this your testimony
[1:07:16] always and your thoughts everything
[1:07:18] never permit a negative thought to come
[1:07:21] in your mind if you can help
[1:07:24] it when it starts that don't entertain
[1:07:28] it well you say I can't help the
[1:07:30] thoughts from coming well that'll be
[1:07:32] like the farmer that said he couldn't
[1:07:35] stop the birds from flying over his
[1:07:36] place but he he he could sure stop them
[1:07:39] from
[1:07:40] roosting so that's a good thing you see
[1:07:42] you can't help the thoughts when they
[1:07:44] come but don't entertain them just pass
[1:07:47] it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior
[1:07:50] All Things Are Mine by God I'm going to
[1:07:52] keep them I'm going to testify of them
[1:07:54] and God can only bless you as you
[1:07:56] confess that he confess that he has done
[1:07:59] it for you he's the high priest of your
[1:08:02] confession then again in 59 he says you
[1:08:05] that accepted healing and you don't feel
[1:08:07] any different he went through the prayer
[1:08:10] line or they prayed in a meeting they
[1:08:11] accepted healing but they didn't feel
[1:08:13] any
[1:08:15] different you say my faith is not enough
[1:08:17] to move it right now brother
[1:08:19] brandom then he says take the adopted
[1:08:22] child way don't take that way but come
[1:08:24] to the ad opted child way just keep
[1:08:27] saying Lord I am healed I believe it
[1:08:30] it'll come you get your right
[1:08:33] mood your mood you get your right mood
[1:08:36] that's your mental attitude you get your
[1:08:39] right mood you see and then your faith
[1:08:41] will be right it'll take it you just
[1:08:43] believe it with all your heart amen you
[1:08:47] realize what comes out of our mouths is
[1:08:49] really
[1:08:51] important cuz what what our ears hear
[1:08:54] our mouth say affect us
[1:08:56] affect our mind affect our temperament
[1:08:58] affect us we have to be very careful
[1:09:00] that we confess the word of God not the
[1:09:02] lies that the devil is trying to feed us
[1:09:05] lies like you'll never get over this
[1:09:07] lies like it'll never be any different
[1:09:09] lies like you can't change all those
[1:09:11] lies you cannot repeat those lies
[1:09:15] because as you repeat those lies there's
[1:09:17] a power with spoken
[1:09:19] word and we don't want to be found
[1:09:21] speaking those words but we want to be
[1:09:23] found speaking the true words
[1:09:26] that can't
[1:09:28] fail so if God's given us a measure of
[1:09:30] free moral agency and we get to choose
[1:09:33] then let's choose to speak the word and
[1:09:35] choose not to speak anything contrary to
[1:09:37] the
[1:09:40] word amen said you get your right mood
[1:09:43] and then your faith will be right I love
[1:09:48] this and in the message a man running
[1:09:50] from the presence of the Lord Brother
[1:09:52] tells this story said something like I
[1:09:54] was told one time that a lady said back
[1:09:57] in the horse in buggy days that said the
[1:09:59] horse run away with her going from
[1:10:01] church and said what' you do said I
[1:10:03] trusted the Lord until the lines
[1:10:07] broke said well that's the time to trust
[1:10:09] the Lord after the lines is broke you're
[1:10:12] trusting in the lines until they're
[1:10:15] broke now this is really
[1:10:19] important that little statement that
[1:10:21] that woman made I trusted I trusted in
[1:10:23] the Lord till the lines broke and then I
[1:10:25] panicked and brother brandom is so Keen
[1:10:28] to to point out that then her faith was
[1:10:31] not in the Lord regardless of what her
[1:10:32] confession is her faith was in the
[1:10:35] lines because when the lines broke she
[1:10:38] lost
[1:10:40] faith oh this is this is this gets down
[1:10:43] to
[1:10:46] nitty-gritty many times we can believe
[1:10:48] the message we can believe certain
[1:10:50] things as long as the lines don't break
[1:10:55] now you can interpret those lines any
[1:10:57] way you want like like I go to the
[1:11:00] doctor the doctor has a treatment that
[1:11:01] treatment seems to be working and I'm
[1:11:03] trusting God as the treatments working
[1:11:04] and God heals through doctors he heals
[1:11:06] through medicine so I'm not discounting
[1:11:08] that but when the medicine starts to
[1:11:10] [Applause]
[1:11:12] fail and what worked before isn't
[1:11:14] working
[1:11:16] anymore then we'll find out where our
[1:11:19] faith is is it in the medicine or is it
[1:11:21] in the
[1:11:22] Lord cuz when we start to panic because
[1:11:24] it's no working it shows that we were
[1:11:26] putting faith in the medicine not in God
[1:11:29] God can use medicine but I'm trusting
[1:11:30] God to use the medicine for my healing
[1:11:32] not the medicine so if the medicine
[1:11:35] fails it doesn't change anything God's
[1:11:36] still my
[1:11:38] healer it's it was God all along it was
[1:11:41] never the medicine he may choose to use
[1:11:43] the medicine and if he does and leads me
[1:11:44] that way I got faith that God's going to
[1:11:46] use the medicine if he chooses to use a
[1:11:48] doctor or a chiropractor or surgeon then
[1:11:50] I've got faith that I'm going to be
[1:11:52] healed because this is God's method for
[1:11:53] me but if the method fails I don't lose
[1:11:56] faith in God because the method
[1:11:58] failed because God's word is a promise
[1:12:01] to me that by his stripes I am healed
[1:12:04] that he's The God Who heals all of our
[1:12:06] diseases if I go into panic and listen
[1:12:09] sometimes listen we believe the message
[1:12:11] until a relationship around us has
[1:12:14] failed a friend a church relationship
[1:12:17] something goes wrong in the church
[1:12:19] something wrong with the pastor the
[1:12:21] turmoil in the church and all of a
[1:12:22] sudden I'm starting to doubt the message
[1:12:24] or not that that means your faith was in
[1:12:27] the lines not in
[1:12:29] God faith was in a human relationship
[1:12:32] and when the human relationship failed I
[1:12:34] started having doubts and questions and
[1:12:36] insecurity and all of the things then
[1:12:39] our our faith was in a human
[1:12:41] relationship not in the Divine word of
[1:12:45] God Amen and these are good that God
[1:12:48] will allow these things to be pointed
[1:12:49] out in our life so that we realize I was
[1:12:51] putting confidence in man I was putting
[1:12:54] confidence in a Minister I was putting
[1:12:56] confidence in my brothers and sisters
[1:12:58] but I was supposed to have confidence in
[1:12:59] God alone God works through a minister
[1:13:02] God works through my brothers and
[1:13:03] sisters like he works through a doctor
[1:13:04] or
[1:13:07] medicine but you know what there're
[1:13:09] still human beings and those lines can
[1:13:12] break the human element is weak riddled
[1:13:16] with failure Pro prone to
[1:13:20] collapse but when the human element
[1:13:23] collapses and then our faith collapses
[1:13:27] then our faith was in the human element
[1:13:29] not in
[1:13:32] God that's the
[1:13:35] reality I say God help us to put our
[1:13:39] confidence in you and you
[1:13:45] alone
[1:13:48] amen see there's just a couple examples
[1:13:51] I want to
[1:13:53] give as we as we wind down I just want
[1:13:56] to share a couple examples from the
[1:13:58] scriptures back in Genesis 37 Joseph was
[1:14:02] had a dream he had two dreams a series
[1:14:04] of two dreams and in those dreams he
[1:14:08] realized that he was going to be in a
[1:14:10] position of PR prom
[1:14:14] prominence and that his brothers were
[1:14:15] going to bow to him because he saw all
[1:14:17] these sheeps in the field and the 11
[1:14:19] shoes of his brothers bowed to him then
[1:14:22] he saw in the next dream the Sun and the
[1:14:24] Moon which is mother and father and uh
[1:14:27] 12 stars and the 11 Stars his brothers
[1:14:29] and his mother and father they all bowed
[1:14:30] and did Obe Essence unto him and and
[1:14:34] this is what angered his his Brethren
[1:14:35] and and so now Joseph has a dream and
[1:14:39] that dream to him is a
[1:14:42] prophecy so he knows the will of God in
[1:14:44] his life and the will of God in his life
[1:14:47] is that he's going to rise to a position
[1:14:49] where his family is going to bow to
[1:14:51] him the problem is Joseph doesn't know
[1:14:54] how he's going to get from point point A
[1:14:55] to point
[1:14:56] B he knows what point B is but he
[1:15:00] doesn't know what the Journey's like
[1:15:01] from point A to point
[1:15:03] B you know when he had that dream I
[1:15:06] doubt that he very much could have
[1:15:07] anticipated being hated by his brother
[1:15:09] sold into slavery gone to Egypt hey
[1:15:12] there's no way that he could have
[1:15:13] anticipated that this was God's way of
[1:15:16] fulfilling the
[1:15:18] prophecy so when we talk about the right
[1:15:21] mental attitude and we talk about the
[1:15:23] battle in our mind consider Joseph now
[1:15:25] for a minute who's got a promise of God
[1:15:28] through a prophetic dream that he knows
[1:15:29] what's going to happen in his life and
[1:15:31] the position that God has for him and
[1:15:33] then all of a sudden the very next thing
[1:15:35] that happens in his life is the opposite
[1:15:38] of the
[1:15:40] dream like it's not
[1:15:43] working like your brothers don't bow to
[1:15:46] you they hate
[1:15:48] you and they sell you uh to to the
[1:15:52] moabites to the ishmaelites amen to
[1:15:54] become a slave and then you're in
[1:15:57] bondage in a in a in a train in a camel
[1:15:59] train being taken down to Egypt when you
[1:16:02] get down there you're sold into the
[1:16:03] slaver or you become a slave in Piper's
[1:16:04] house my goodness you talk about having
[1:16:07] the opposite effect this is the word of
[1:16:09] the Lord this is what
[1:16:12] happened put them together like when
[1:16:15] somebody come in the prayer line Amen
[1:16:17] brother B had to teach people about
[1:16:18] Divine Healing they come in a prayer
[1:16:20] line they got prayed for by a prophet
[1:16:23] who has a gift of Divine Healing given
[1:16:25] to him and they were prayed for and the
[1:16:27] next day they got sicker
[1:16:29] opposite opposite they thought they were
[1:16:32] going to get better they got sicker and
[1:16:34] brother bandam says that's the very
[1:16:36] indication that you're getting well
[1:16:38] don't lose your faith amen don't give up
[1:16:41] on the promise don't don't take what you
[1:16:43] accepted yesterday and throw it in the
[1:16:45] trash today because of the
[1:16:48] circumstances the circumstances are the
[1:16:50] lying vanities the word of God is thus
[1:16:52] sayeth the Lord
[1:16:56] amen praise God so
[1:17:00] now Joseph has this deal in Piper's
[1:17:06] house then that goes sour he winds up in
[1:17:10] prison he gets some position of
[1:17:13] prominence in prison like it goes from
[1:17:15] slavery to
[1:17:16] prison like it's
[1:17:19] worse and and I want you to consider
[1:17:22] with me this is what I'm considering is
[1:17:25] the Mind battle Joseph was
[1:17:28] in if Elisha was a man of like passions
[1:17:31] as you and
[1:17:32] I what do you think Joseph
[1:17:35] was do you think Joseph ever said what
[1:17:38] in the world is going
[1:17:41] on Lord do do do you think he could have
[1:17:44] ever possibly said Lord I don't
[1:17:47] understand what's
[1:17:49] happening I don't understand why I
[1:17:53] believe the dream
[1:17:55] I believe you showed me but I don't
[1:17:57] understand what's happening am and maybe
[1:18:00] he didn't say that maybe he had perfect
[1:18:02] Faith all the way through but I know
[1:18:04] myself and I would have probably asked
[1:18:06] myself something like
[1:18:07] that I would have probably cried and
[1:18:10] cried and cried and say God I don't
[1:18:12] understand what did I miss what's wrong
[1:18:13] with me God where where have I failed
[1:18:15] where am I broken what's the problem
[1:18:17] with me
[1:18:19] yes that's probably what I would have
[1:18:21] been doing I'd have been probably saying
[1:18:24] God
[1:18:25] then then you know the devil puts
[1:18:27] thoughts remember what he said the the
[1:18:30] the birds can fly over your head so the
[1:18:33] thoughts can come in your mind but don't
[1:18:35] let them
[1:18:37] Roost chase them away the thoughts come
[1:18:41] brother said the devil can put thoughts
[1:18:43] in your mind but he can't read your
[1:18:46] mind he can whisper thoughts into your
[1:18:48] ear but he cannot read your mind and
[1:18:50] then the thoughts
[1:18:52] come well maybe I Mis understood the
[1:18:58] dream now I'm not trying to tell you
[1:19:00] what happened to Joseph I'm just trying
[1:19:01] to tell you if I was switched in that
[1:19:03] place being the kind of human I've been
[1:19:04] those are the questions I would
[1:19:07] ask what's wrong with me what what did I
[1:19:10] do
[1:19:11] wrong why am I
[1:19:13] here maybe I misunderstood maybe maybe I
[1:19:18] can't really interpret dreams maybe I
[1:19:20] was just kidding
[1:19:23] myself maybe I'm I'm not really one of
[1:19:28] them amen the devil the devil Whispers
[1:19:31] in everybody's
[1:19:34] ear amen he he cannot I couldn't say he
[1:19:39] can't possibly God could have sh him
[1:19:40] anything but a human being can't draw
[1:19:43] the equation from all the prophecy okay
[1:19:46] bondage oh slavery I get it slavery okay
[1:19:50] now to Egypt then slavery to prison okay
[1:19:53] I'm in Pharaoh's prison oh I see the
[1:19:55] whole plan God's got this mapped out
[1:19:56] perfect I don't think it was like
[1:19:59] that you know what happens when we come
[1:20:01] through situations and our life they
[1:20:03] become testimonies amen we look back
[1:20:05] over and we say absolutely every step
[1:20:07] was perfect that decision I was Cur I
[1:20:09] didn't know it was right or not it was
[1:20:11] perfect that timing that the decision
[1:20:14] that position I but while it was going
[1:20:16] on you were like I have no idea I don't
[1:20:19] know if this is right or wrong I'm just
[1:20:20] doing what I feel to do and I and it
[1:20:22] looks like I made a mistake oh God I'm
[1:20:24] sorry if that was a mistake I don't
[1:20:26] know this is how we pray this is how we
[1:20:29] talk this is how we live amen and then
[1:20:31] we get on the other side of a situation
[1:20:33] you look back everything is lined up
[1:20:35] perfect according to the results God
[1:20:37] wanted amen but when you were in the
[1:20:39] middle of it you were fighting mind
[1:20:41] battles like crazy trying to know if you
[1:20:43] were right or wrong or you misunderstood
[1:20:45] or you got something off or there's a
[1:20:47] hidden sin in your life or somehow God
[1:20:49] hates
[1:20:52] you I mean I don't believe I'm the only
[1:20:55] one in this
[1:20:57] position but the reality is amen we have
[1:21:00] to believe be we have to believe the
[1:21:02] word of God and say you know what I'm
[1:21:05] not here because of myself that God has
[1:21:07] drawn me God has called me and he didn't
[1:21:09] call me unless he knew me before the
[1:21:11] foundation of the world Amen and he
[1:21:12] revealed himself to me and revealed this
[1:21:14] message to me and I'm here by the
[1:21:16] drawing and calling of the Lord not by
[1:21:19] myself and now I believe that the
[1:21:21] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:21:23] of the Lord and He delighted in his will
[1:21:25] and brother bam said he even he even
[1:21:27] makes our mistakes work together for his
[1:21:30] perfect will and I believe by the grace
[1:21:32] of God I'm one of them and even my
[1:21:34] mistakes will work together for his
[1:21:36] perfect will in my
[1:21:39] life the problem we run into is when we
[1:21:42] allow amen these things in life to beat
[1:21:45] us down we start to question and we
[1:21:47] start to second guess and what it does
[1:21:49] to us is it changes our mental attitude
[1:21:52] towards the promise of God and it start
[1:21:54] to seow doubt and apprehension and we
[1:21:57] lose that aggressive nature we need to
[1:21:59] keep pressing
[1:22:00] on we get into a middle of a set of
[1:22:03] circumstances and now all of a sudden
[1:22:05] instead of marching forward like a
[1:22:07] mighty marching Army we're putting
[1:22:09] sandbags up to defend
[1:22:13] territory we better hunker down right
[1:22:16] here I don't know if I'm going the right
[1:22:17] direction or
[1:22:20] not we were certain of it a day ago but
[1:22:23] today I'm I'm digging a foxhole right
[1:22:26] here because I'm taking enemy fire and I
[1:22:28] don't know that I'm
[1:22:32] right
[1:22:34] amen you know the best thing that we can
[1:22:37] do is if we were convinced it was the
[1:22:39] will of God and God hasn't told us
[1:22:41] differently the best thing we can do is
[1:22:43] put our head down and keep walking and
[1:22:45] saying God I cannot find my own way I
[1:22:48] cannot do what's right I cannot make a
[1:22:50] sound decision to save my life but God
[1:22:52] I'm going to close my eyes and put my
[1:22:54] hand in yours and if I'm making a wrong
[1:22:56] step just turn me somehow step me
[1:22:58] somewhere else move me in some way I
[1:23:01] don't know what to do but I believe that
[1:23:03] you want me to go from here to there and
[1:23:05] I'm going from here to there unless you
[1:23:08] tell me something
[1:23:11] different what else can we do every time
[1:23:14] we start moving in second guess start
[1:23:16] moving in second guess the the Bible
[1:23:18] says a a a a double-minded man is
[1:23:21] unstable in all of his ways
[1:23:25] every once in a while we have to set our
[1:23:27] face like flint and
[1:23:29] move and I believe if we're wrong God
[1:23:33] will wake us
[1:23:35] up we're his
[1:23:38] children amen we're not his
[1:23:41] enemies we're his
[1:23:43] children we're not his puppets we're not
[1:23:45] his toys we're not his ponds we're his
[1:23:51] children if I was an honest heart of
[1:23:53] moving forward doing the best I know how
[1:23:55] to do be believing with all my heart
[1:23:57] this is what God wants and I get a
[1:23:59] little bit off the path I believe that I
[1:24:01] have a father who's a Shepherd who will
[1:24:03] bring me back on because he loves
[1:24:09] me amen but I don't want life
[1:24:13] circumstances in the mind battle to
[1:24:16] cause me to stop
[1:24:20] pressing to stop
[1:24:23] striving to lose my my aggressive
[1:24:26] approach to the things of
[1:24:29] God and you find sometimes in life that
[1:24:31] happens to us happens to all of
[1:24:35] us has anybody ever had a slump before
[1:24:41] spiritually amen I've had several of
[1:24:47] them you just get into a place where
[1:24:50] feel like you don't know any more
[1:24:52] anything don't know what right you don't
[1:24:55] know what to do you don't know where to
[1:24:56] go and but what it causes is the wrong
[1:24:59] mental attitude towards the word of God
[1:25:01] that's what that
[1:25:05] causes you know it's a good thing to
[1:25:07] doubt
[1:25:09] yourself but it's a bad thing to doubt
[1:25:11] the
[1:25:13] word so we get into these fixes
[1:25:19] sometimes he
[1:25:21] says here's what brother Brenham says
[1:25:24] in the everpresent water from The Rock
[1:25:27] Says you see many times people thinks
[1:25:29] that a prophetic gift that God just says
[1:25:32] I'll pick you up right here and set you
[1:25:34] down here now you just go right over
[1:25:36] here and he doesn't tell you all those
[1:25:39] things if he did then what overcoming
[1:25:42] Faith did you
[1:25:44] have see he lets you stand alone more
[1:25:48] than anybody else brother R's talking
[1:25:50] about himself now with a prophetic gift
[1:25:52] he lets you stand alone more than
[1:25:53] anybody else you all can come to me and
[1:25:57] ask for certain things and he's never
[1:25:58] failed yet but what he gives you the
[1:26:00] answer that's right but I can ask him
[1:26:03] for things for myself and many times he
[1:26:05] just lets me alone and just let me go
[1:26:07] ahead and walk into it
[1:26:11] yes you talk about a mind
[1:26:14] battle a mind battle this man has a gift
[1:26:17] that he can tell you where your car keys
[1:26:19] are who stole your car how far they
[1:26:21] drove it where they brought it and where
[1:26:22] they parked it yeah
[1:26:25] but when he ask something for himself
[1:26:29] nothing talking about mind battles I
[1:26:31] mean I can imagine the Mind battles I
[1:26:33] can imagine the discouragement I can
[1:26:35] imagine the difficulty I can imagine the
[1:26:37] question why God why it works so good
[1:26:40] but nothing now I'm praying to you and
[1:26:42] I'm getting
[1:26:44] nothing oh my
[1:26:46] goodness he says Now list is what
[1:26:48] brother Rim said I have things now that
[1:26:51] I have to solve out myself
[1:26:55] and decisions I have to
[1:26:58] make and this is such a vital one till I
[1:27:00] cannot exactly make it until I'm sure
[1:27:02] that it's him speaking to me he won't
[1:27:05] give me a vision he just lets me alone
[1:27:08] so I'm just sitting as an orphan like
[1:27:10] this morning I don't know which way to
[1:27:13] turn so I've committed it to the
[1:27:15] Lord I love I'm so thankful the prophet
[1:27:19] said this he said I'm sitting here like
[1:27:22] an orphan this morning what did he feel
[1:27:24] like he felt abandoned with no and and
[1:27:26] you know what he would think I I've been
[1:27:28] this way before where I've needed God to
[1:27:30] speak to me so bad I had to have an
[1:27:33] answer I needed it with all that's in me
[1:27:35] amen at least I thought that I did and
[1:27:38] and and I said God it's so simple for
[1:27:40] you one
[1:27:43] word I don't know if you ever prayed
[1:27:45] like that but I mean I've been de God
[1:27:47] one word it takes nothing if you would
[1:27:49] just nod your head this would go away
[1:27:51] why won't you speak why won't you answer
[1:27:54] I've cried out to God before said God
[1:27:56] you can speak many have heard your voice
[1:27:58] you have a voice and you can speak why
[1:28:01] aren't you speaking to
[1:28:06] me amen I I've been I've been in this
[1:28:10] spot where I felt like there's there I
[1:28:12] have no idea what to do I can't go
[1:28:14] forward I can't do anything unless God
[1:28:16] speaks to me he's got to show me I need
[1:28:18] a sign I need something and you know
[1:28:20] what I got I got absolutely nothing
[1:28:26] because nothing was better than a sign
[1:28:28] nothing was better than an audible voice
[1:28:31] because there's some things that I had
[1:28:32] to work out on my own some decision I
[1:28:34] had to make on my own to prove what was
[1:28:36] inside of
[1:28:38] me God God doesn't always make it easy
[1:28:41] friends we get into situation listen
[1:28:43] when when they came out of Egypt they
[1:28:45] come out of Egypt singing and dancing
[1:28:47] and shouting and having a glorious time
[1:28:49] amen God had delivered them he had spoke
[1:28:51] through the prophet everything he said
[1:28:53] come to pass and come right down to the
[1:28:55] Red Sea to an insurmountable obstacle
[1:28:57] and they were all going to
[1:29:00] die that's right they had no clue what
[1:29:03] to do or how to get out of it go back
[1:29:05] can't go back can't go forward can't do
[1:29:09] anything Moses starts crying out to God
[1:29:11] they cry to Moses Moses cries to God and
[1:29:14] God said why cry speak and go
[1:29:18] forward why did he say that why did he
[1:29:21] say speak and go forward
[1:29:24] because God had already told Moses
[1:29:26] you're going to go fetch my children and
[1:29:28] you're going to bring them back to this
[1:29:31] mountain so he already had the word of
[1:29:34] God he didn't need a new word of God he
[1:29:37] already had the word of God and the word
[1:29:39] of God is you will go get my children
[1:29:42] and you will bring them and they will
[1:29:44] worship me on this
[1:29:46] mountain so when he hid an
[1:29:48] insurmountable obstacle amen he CED the
[1:29:51] most logical thing to do is cry out to
[1:29:52] God and God says why cry out to me speak
[1:29:54] and go forward I've already told you
[1:29:56] you're coming back to the mountain so
[1:29:58] just come back to the mountain I'll move
[1:30:00] the obstacles
[1:30:03] away God already promised we're healed I
[1:30:06] don't know what he's going to do or how
[1:30:07] many obstacles I get but for me it's not
[1:30:10] to figure out I just move forward
[1:30:11] towards my healing and trust God God
[1:30:14] will work it out he's got a plan and
[1:30:15] he'll work his plan he'll fulfill his
[1:30:17] own word amen but I've got to keep
[1:30:19] moving forward towards the promise
[1:30:22] amen amen
[1:30:24] whatever that promise may
[1:30:28] be
[1:30:30] oh it doesn't always come
[1:30:33] easy I don't think he wants it to be
[1:30:36] easy I think he's proving his
[1:30:41] children I think he wants to display
[1:30:44] what's on the inside of you and
[1:30:46] I you know we don't really know we don't
[1:30:49] really comprehend the full potential
[1:30:51] that's in a child of God amen we don't
[1:30:55] really comprehend it we can talk about
[1:30:58] it we can even quote the things brother
[1:30:59] Brenham says about it like he says if
[1:31:01] you've got a shadow of the life of God
[1:31:03] in you you've got enough power into you
[1:31:04] to create another world and go live a
[1:31:05] private life on
[1:31:08] it but we can quote that but I don't
[1:31:10] think we comprehend
[1:31:12] that but you know what God will do
[1:31:15] sometimes he'll let us get into
[1:31:16] circumstances because he wants us to
[1:31:18] know that greater is he that is in ye in
[1:31:21] thee than he that's in the world
[1:31:25] amen and faith comes
[1:31:28] out and and and and a determination
[1:31:32] comes out and grit comes out and and a
[1:31:34] laying hold of the promises comes out
[1:31:36] why because that's part of God's
[1:31:38] character that's in there and sometimes
[1:31:39] to get the fragrance out of a rose
[1:31:41] you've got to squeeze
[1:31:44] it amen so many
[1:31:48] times the battle is in the
[1:31:51] mind and that's where we've got to have
[1:31:54] Victory is in the mind so many
[1:31:57] circumstances in life so many
[1:32:00] difficulties but what we're really
[1:32:02] struggling with is our own thoughts
[1:32:05] right what we're really trying to
[1:32:07] overcome is our own thinking so that we
[1:32:09] can keep moving forward into the promise
[1:32:11] of
[1:32:12] God and sometimes God will let us sit
[1:32:16] like an orphan and not say anything to
[1:32:19] us I mean there so many times listen God
[1:32:22] is so good to us there's so many times
[1:32:24] we'll come to the service with a
[1:32:25] question in our heart and God will
[1:32:27] answer it over the preaching of the word
[1:32:29] so specific you cannot miss that it was
[1:32:31] God answering your
[1:32:32] question do you know there's other times
[1:32:34] you come with just as much a desperate
[1:32:36] need and say God I need to hear an
[1:32:37] answer and I'm coming I'm coming this is
[1:32:39] your way and you're going to answer
[1:32:40] today and you walk out with the same
[1:32:42] question you walked in
[1:32:45] with he's just as able to answer the one
[1:32:48] is the
[1:32:51] other amen
[1:32:54] sometimes he just wants to see what you
[1:32:55] and I will do about
[1:32:57] it because the battle we've got to win
[1:32:59] is the Mind battle and I don't think
[1:33:02] it's going to get easier but I think
[1:33:04] God's training
[1:33:06] us teaching us not to rely on
[1:33:11] circumstances but to trust in his
[1:33:14] word his word
[1:33:16] says Go destroy the
[1:33:19] benjamites they they whipped us what do
[1:33:21] we do go destroy the benjamites
[1:33:24] but God they whipped us what do we do go
[1:33:26] destroy the
[1:33:29] benjamites
[1:33:30] amen maybe there's a lesson in all of it
[1:33:35] maybe this whole life there's a lesson
[1:33:37] in all of it for all of us to stick with
[1:33:41] his word and keep sticking with his word
[1:33:44] and keep sticking with his word
[1:33:49] until am amen I want to read one more
[1:33:52] scripture together before we go let's go
[1:33:54] to Hebrews chapter
[1:34:01] 10 Hebrews chapter
[1:34:07] 10:32 before we read it I just want to
[1:34:09] say sometimes the
[1:34:11] test is
[1:34:13] time and
[1:34:18] silence that was a test for Abraham
[1:34:20] right God come to Abraham and told him
[1:34:22] you're going to go to this land and I'm
[1:34:23] going to give it to you and your
[1:34:25] seed then a long time went by before God
[1:34:28] spoke to him again sometimes when we
[1:34:30] read the Bible and you let's say we read
[1:34:32] the story of Abraham it's like God's
[1:34:35] always coming to him talking to him like
[1:34:37] he God's talking to him all the time but
[1:34:40] you know there was years when God never
[1:34:42] spoke to
[1:34:43] him years of what years of keeping sheep
[1:34:46] years of managing the servants years of
[1:34:49] moving about years of life
[1:34:54] with obstacles and struggles and
[1:34:56] trials and in those years no doubt
[1:34:59] Abraham would have questions sometimes
[1:35:01] because God would come back to him and
[1:35:03] speak to him again and Abraham would say
[1:35:07] God you've given me no seed and one
[1:35:09] that's born in my own house is my Heir
[1:35:11] but God had already told them your
[1:35:13] seed's going to possess the land he
[1:35:16] already had a promise that your seed is
[1:35:18] going to have this land I'm giving it to
[1:35:20] you and your seed after you but now time
[1:35:23] goes on and silence goes on and the next
[1:35:25] time God talks to him he says you
[1:35:27] haven't given me a seed and this one
[1:35:29] that's in my house is my Heir and God
[1:35:32] says Oh no you're mistaken that's not
[1:35:34] your air but the one that comes out of
[1:35:35] your bow should be your air what was the
[1:35:38] challenge for Abraham the challenge was
[1:35:41] time and
[1:35:43] silence listen most all of us have
[1:35:46] Supernatural events in our lives times
[1:35:48] that God did something Supernatural and
[1:35:50] special without question that was God he
[1:35:53] spoke to me he gave me a sign he
[1:35:54] answered a prayer he did something
[1:35:56] that's
[1:35:57] unquestionable but guess what that's not
[1:35:59] every day of our lives and sometimes we
[1:36:01] like to act like we're super spiritual
[1:36:02] and we have this thing that happens
[1:36:04] every day of Our Lives but the reality
[1:36:06] is God will do something Supernatural
[1:36:08] and special and then you'll go through
[1:36:10] years sometimes of Silence with no other
[1:36:12] Supernatural event why because you've
[1:36:15] got to press into the kingdom we've got
[1:36:18] to overcome by faith our faith has to be
[1:36:20] groomed and encouraged do you realize
[1:36:22] your faith can grow
[1:36:25] that's what Paul says you grow within
[1:36:27] Faith Paul even said when I come I want
[1:36:29] to come and and add what's lacking in
[1:36:31] your faith our faith can grow and God
[1:36:34] was growing Abraham's Faith all through
[1:36:36] time until when he gives the report
[1:36:38] through Paul at the end he said he
[1:36:39] staggered not at the promise of God when
[1:36:42] you go through and read it's all kinds
[1:36:44] of little questions and this and trying
[1:36:46] that and doing that and it looks like
[1:36:48] he's staggering but God's not worried
[1:36:50] about the process God's looking at the
[1:36:52] result the Finish
[1:36:55] line and at the Finish Line he staggered
[1:36:58] not at the promise of God but he
[1:37:00] believed God was
[1:37:02] faithful sometimes we look at our life
[1:37:04] and we're looking at the
[1:37:07] process and it looks like a big old
[1:37:11] mess I because the process isn't always
[1:37:13] clean and neat and nice and tidy you
[1:37:18] know but God is bringing us to a desired
[1:37:22] end
[1:37:24] he's working on us he's growing our
[1:37:27] faith he's teaching us to win the battle
[1:37:30] in the mind he's showing us how to lay
[1:37:33] hold of the promise and hold on and not
[1:37:35] let go how does he do it maybe we got
[1:37:38] shook off a couple
[1:37:41] times maybe we got shook off along the
[1:37:43] way once or twice but then we realize
[1:37:45] next time I'm not going to get shook off
[1:37:49] and the next time we get a hold of a
[1:37:50] promise of God and all of a sudden it
[1:37:52] starts shaking he say I'm not going to
[1:37:55] let you go till you bless
[1:37:58] me amen oh praise God maybe we just need
[1:38:03] the training to win the Mind battle to
[1:38:07] stay with the word of God regard us of
[1:38:10] what we see feel think hear amen stay
[1:38:15] with the word of God prise God Hebrews
[1:38:18] chap 10:32
[1:38:24] he
[1:38:25] says but call to remembrance the former
[1:38:27] days in which after you were illuminated
[1:38:30] ye endured a great fight of
[1:38:32] afflictions partly whilst you were made
[1:38:35] a gazing stock both by reproaches and
[1:38:37] afflictions and partly whilst you became
[1:38:39] Companions of them that were so used for
[1:38:42] you had compassion of me in my bonds and
[1:38:44] took joyfully the spoiling of your goods
[1:38:47] knowing in yourselves that ye have in
[1:38:49] heaven a better and enduring
[1:38:52] sustance cast pass not away therefore
[1:38:54] your confidence which had great
[1:38:56] recompense of reward for you have need
[1:38:58] of patience that after you have done the
[1:38:59] will of God you might receive the
[1:39:01] promise for yet a little while and he
[1:39:04] that shall come will come and will not
[1:39:06] tar now the just shall live by faith but
[1:39:09] if any draw back my soul shall have no
[1:39:12] pleasure in him but we are not of them
[1:39:15] who draw back into predition but of them
[1:39:17] that believe to the saving of the
[1:39:20] Soul amen God bless you as we stand we
[1:39:23] want to finish with this scripture amen
[1:39:25] how many of you believe that God's
[1:39:27] called you not to be of the drawing back
[1:39:29] kind amen listen not because you're a
[1:39:32] super strong person but because he's
[1:39:34] planted his seed inside of you and he
[1:39:36] knows the potential in that seed and
[1:39:38] he's using the circumstances in life to
[1:39:40] draw the potential out of the seed to
[1:39:43] have a son or daughter of God like him
[1:39:46] on the
[1:39:47] earth
[1:39:49] amen I
[1:39:51] failed I'm probably going to fail
[1:39:56] again you may not
[1:39:59] have but praise God I
[1:40:03] failed but my failures have done
[1:40:05] something to me they've put inside of me
[1:40:08] a greater desire to never fail his word
[1:40:13] again they've taught me a lesson that I
[1:40:15] don't want to
[1:40:17] forget they've showed me my Frailty they
[1:40:20] showed me my Human Condition they've
[1:40:21] showed me my inability
[1:40:24] it may be completely relying on him and
[1:40:27] on his word to exposed the trappings of
[1:40:30] the devil to exposed the lies of the
[1:40:32] devil maybe that was the purpose all
[1:40:34] along to mold and make character inside
[1:40:37] of
[1:40:38] us amen
[1:40:40] but we're not of them that draw
[1:40:44] back why are we not of them that draw
[1:40:46] back because he's predestinated this
[1:40:49] bride not to
[1:40:51] fail that's why we're not of them who
[1:40:53] draw back because he predestinated said
[1:40:55] this bride won't fail she's
[1:40:57] predestinated not to fail and he says
[1:40:59] we've been predestinated to be conformed
[1:41:01] into the image of his son so we've been
[1:41:03] predestinated unto
[1:41:05] adoption so for us there's no option but
[1:41:08] forward amen forward
[1:41:11] forward yeah I got knocked down that's
[1:41:14] okay there's no option but
[1:41:16] forward I got derailed that's fine too
[1:41:19] come back to where you got off but the
[1:41:20] only option is forward cuz you've been
[1:41:22] predestinated unto the adoption of
[1:41:24] children by Jesus Christ you've been
[1:41:26] predestinated to be conformed into the
