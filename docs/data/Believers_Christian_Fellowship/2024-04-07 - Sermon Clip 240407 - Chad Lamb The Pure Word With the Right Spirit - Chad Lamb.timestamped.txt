[0:00] it's speaking the truth in love it's
[0:02] speaking the truth with the very motive
[0:04] of God in giving the
[0:06] word because God so loved the world that
[0:10] he gave his only begotten son that
[0:12] whosoever should believeth in him shall
[0:14] not be condemned but have everlasting
[0:16] life amen is that what he said the next
[0:19] verse he sent not his son into the world
[0:22] to condemn the
[0:24] world but the world through him might be
[0:26] saved amen amen so what was his motive
[0:31] in sending Jesus Christ his motive was
[0:34] love and his motive was
[0:38] salvation when somebody rejected that
[0:41] they're already condemned they're
[0:43] condemned already because they receive
[0:45] not the Son of God they're already
[0:47] condemned he didn't send the son to
[0:50] condemn the world they were already
[0:52] condemned by the Fall In the Garden of
[0:53] Eden he sent the son into the world for
[0:58] salvation love sent Jesus Christ he was
[1:01] an expression of God's love Jesus died
[1:04] motivated by
[1:07] love so now how should I administer this
[1:10] message with the same motive that God
[1:13] gave it how should I administer the
[1:15] scriptures with the same motive God gave
[1:17] it amen how should I witness I should
[1:19] witness to others with the same
[1:20] motivation behind me that motivated God
[1:24] to send Jesus Christ into the world that
[1:26] they might be
[1:28] saved but I I have failed so many times
[1:31] in witnessing because many times in
[1:34] witnessing I was using the word to
[1:37] condemn somebody else and to vindicate
[1:39] myself as knowing what the Bible said
[1:41] and being right and somehow being holy
[1:43] and you're not holy and you're wrong and
[1:45] you're condemned and I used the wrong
[1:48] motive with the
[1:49] word the word was pure but my heart was
[1:56] evil I wanted to prove I was right and
[1:59] they were wrong
[2:02] is that why Jesus that is that why Jesus
[2:04] came into the world is that why God sent
[2:07] his son is that why God gave us a
[2:09] message is that why he gave a love
[2:11] letter to the
[2:13] bride will there be judgment absolutely
[2:16] anytime you spurn Mercy there's judgment
[2:18] Mercy's been Stern but that wasn't the
[2:20] purpose the world was already in
[2:22] judgment he didn't have to send it for
[2:24] judgment he sent it for mercy and when
[2:26] they spurn Mercy there's nothing left
[2:28] but judgment amen
[2:30] so in witnessing my motive now needs to
[2:33] be love it needs I say God put a love in
[2:36] my heart and honestly I'm to the point
[2:38] where if God doesn't give me a
[2:40] supernatural Love and Desire for a
[2:41] person I better shut my mouth and not
[2:43] say anything to them because I need the
[2:45] right motivation with the word to get
[2:47] the right results and if they if they
[2:49] spurn Mercy then that's between them and
[2:51] God but my motive has to be love and
[2:54] salvation and and because there's a soul
[2:57] at stake and that's got to be my whole
[2:58] Vision not whether I'm right or wrong I
[3:01] can prove it by the Bible and show you
[3:03] that I know something and I'm righteous
[3:04] and you're not that's all got to die and
[3:06] we got to go back to a basic love of
[3:08] souls amen a basic desire to say there's
[3:12] a way out of this trap friend there's a
[3:14] way of Salvation there's an assurance
[3:15] amen you can have what God has given in
[3:17] this day because of love and a desire
[3:19] for Souls not for condemnation self-
[3:22] glorification envy and strive
