TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if I have to go through suffering so that God could say just one word that helps you then it's okay amen I think brother Branham said I would push a a nickel if I knew it this would help me I'd push a nickel or a penny around the whole city if I knew it would help you you see the attitude of a son of God man he would do anything to help you you didn't care who you were didn't care if you were a bride didn't matter I'd do anything I could to help you make your burden a little lighter upon this Earth because life's hard I get it life's difficult I got a lot of sympathy for people and this day my goodness people are losing their minds and you can see why what hope do they have like do you fault a person for going on drugs and drinking themselves what hope do they have stop condemning people they're just trying to satisfy their nerves so they don't lose their minds in this crazy world you know I don't know why I just have a sympathy because I realized yeah without Christ I mean I get it I get it I totally see why you throw yourself into this thing than this thing and this thing and this thing it's because you don't have Christ but I promise you one thing you get Christ you won't thirst that stuff no more I promise you that I promise you brother Branham said something I was speaking to the youth he said it was your faith that lifted you up out of those things it was your faith so many times well God Lifted Me Up out of it no it was your faith in the word that lifted you up out of that God placed something inside of you that could say Amen to the word and you believed it and God like dropped a ladder down into where you were in the mud and the muck and the filth of life and it's like a ladder and you just take a step of faith on that ladder and just wow where am I going you're just climbing out of it you get into the depths of depression I promise you start believing the word you're going to climb out of it you get sorrowful you get weary you get sick I promise you put your faith back in the promise of God he's going to drop like a ladder down until you start climbing yourself out of it it's not rocket science it's just have faith in God he's provided everything we have needed for this Earthly Journey you just got to believe it Stop Believing the devil's lies it's a lie anything contrary to the word of God I don't care how convincing it is I don't care how much your mind reasons with and says that's the truth it's a lie not made to live this life using this does the Bible say God took a man's mind head God took God's devil took a man's mind God took his heart seed of faith is right down inside of there say that's the truth I believe it amen and just climb right on out of it don't let nothing get in your way I think brother bam said just cut your way through every bit of it that's what we do with the word but it's faith in the word why did the word not profit them it was never mixed with faith why is the word not profiting you you're not believing it right you don't want to blame so many people about so many problems maybe you don't believe the word maybe you have more confidence in the Natural Things of life and politics or things of that nature then you have no confidence in the word my goodness man stop consuming the nonsense and start getting back into the word faith comes by hearing the words to start reading the word feeding on the word and see what happens has a way of stirring you back up
