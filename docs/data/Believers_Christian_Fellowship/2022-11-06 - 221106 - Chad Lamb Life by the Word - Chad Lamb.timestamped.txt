[17:03] morning
[17:05] oh Lord Jesus we love you father
[17:08] for your mercy is so enduring in our
[17:11] lives Lord It's Your Grace that has
[17:14] brought us back together and Lord you've

[17:18] love to worship you
[17:20] we love to see your word Lord as it's
[17:22] manifest before us
[17:24] but we pray that you would help us now
[17:26] as we look into your word may you take
[17:28] this vessel under your control For Your
[17:31] Glory mama you did give us ears to hear
[17:34] and a heart to perceive all that you
[17:36] have for us
[17:38] and may we lord glory in your in your
[17:41] Perfection and in your word and may you
[17:43] equip us Lord and may you teach us out
[17:45] of your word by your own hand may you
[17:47] feed us may we bring glory and honor to
[17:50] your name in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[17:54] amen
[17:56] and God bless you while we're standing
[17:57] let's turn to the Gospel of John
[17:59] and let's look at chapter one
[18:01] and it's good to be with you this
[18:03] morning I want to remind you that we
[18:04] have communion and feet washing this
[18:07] afternoon so we'll mention that again at
[18:09] the end of the service so
[18:12] we'll begin looking at John
[18:15] chapter 1.
[18:16] verse 1.
[18:18] scripture we've read so very many times
[18:21] but I think we could preach on this
[18:24] for years and never really touched the
[18:27] depths of it John 1 1 in the beginning
[18:30] was the word
[18:32] and the Word was with God and the Word
[18:34] was God and the same was in the
[18:37] beginning with God all things were made
[18:39] by him and without him was not anything
[18:41] made that was made in him was life and
[18:45] the life was the light of men may God
[18:48] bless you as you take your seats
[18:51] for a subject I'd like to take the Life
[18:55] by the word life by the word so in the
[18:58] beginning was the word the word was with
[19:00] God and the Word was God we know that
[19:03] that in him was life and that life is
[19:07] the light of men so in the word is life
[19:10] amen and so we know that we know that
[19:14] but the prophet taught us that the the
[19:17] word is a thought expressed and the
[19:19] thought is the very essence of God it is
[19:22] who God is his attributes his thoughts
[19:24] and as he began to express himself and
[19:28] when God began to express who he was and
[19:31] what he was he expressed it through word
[19:33] and the word is the thought that is
[19:35] expressed and then that word would come
[19:37] into manifestation and it would be a
[19:39] manifestation or a revealing of God and
[19:42] that word has life and that word is life
[19:45] amen and so life comes by the word amen
[19:49] so so I don't think whatever
[19:52] I don't think we'll ever come to the uh
[19:55] I don't say ever but I don't think we've
[19:57] yet come to the appropriate appreciation
[19:58] for the word that's been revealed to us
[20:00] amen and the power that it holds in the
[20:03] life that it brings and the work that
[20:05] God is accomplishing through his
[20:06] revealed word it actually brings his
[20:09] life on the scene it actually brings his
[20:12] attributes his thoughts his desires amen
[20:15] coming through the word brings his very
[20:17] life through the word amen and there's
[20:19] Life by the word
[20:21] so I want to look at a bit of a familiar
[20:24] subject but I want to go through it
[20:25] again because to me it's very rich and
[20:27] brings such an understanding of God and
[20:30] the power of his word and the message
[20:32] God who is rich in Mercy from 1965 the
[20:36] prophet says many of you can fellowship
[20:37] with me on this thought when you was a
[20:40] little boy or a little girl you would
[20:41] walk around and there would be certain
[20:43] things that would just where it wouldn't
[20:45] bother other kids it seemed like there
[20:47] was something in you that cried out
[20:49] there was God somewhere yet you were a
[20:52] sinner you remember that certainly now
[20:54] what was that that was that little form
[20:56] of life in you then praise be to God and
[21:00] then after a while you heard the gospel
[21:02] maybe you went to church you picked out
[21:04] this and that and went from denomination
[21:06] to denomination but one day you being
[21:09] part of God you had to be part of the
[21:12] word and when you heard the word you
[21:14] node where you come from you know that
[21:16] was the truth you were always the seed
[21:19] was in you always the word word seen the
[21:23] word that was in you that was before the
[21:25] foundation of the world saw the word and
[21:27] you came to it
[21:29] amen praise be to God we know this I
[21:32] mean we've been taught this so many
[21:34] times but I don't I don't ever want this
[21:36] to become old because this is the very
[21:37] power of God in our lives because we had
[21:40] no power to come to him he had to draw
[21:42] us how did he draw Us by his word so
[21:45] where did the drawing power come from
[21:46] from the seed that was inside of us
[21:48] already amen it was already there and it
[21:52] was the thing it had life in it already
[21:54] but it took contact with the present
[21:56] tense word to Quicken that life and
[21:59] bring it into a manifestation in our
[22:01] life amen that's why brother Branham
[22:03] says you can he was reflecting back on
[22:05] his childhood days and and saying many
[22:07] of you can you can you can sympathize
[22:09] with me on this you you know what I'm
[22:11] talking about there was something in you
[22:13] all the way and there would be little
[22:15] little I don't know little Tremors of it
[22:18] or little movements of it or something
[22:20] that would move it or stir it from time
[22:21] to time amen and then maybe you went
[22:24] from church to church and you're picking
[22:25] out some things but when you heard the
[22:27] word amen now listen brother remember
[22:29] said you went from church or heard the
[22:31] gospel went from the nomination to
[22:32] nomination but that wasn't yet the word
[22:35] that would Quicken the seed the word
[22:37] that would Quicken the seed was the word
[22:39] that was a match to that seed amen they
[22:42] had to have a matching word for that
[22:44] seed and you were born amen you were
[22:47] born not for a Pentecostal age you were
[22:50] not born for a Lutheran age amen you
[22:52] were born for a bright age message you
[22:54] were born to receive the message of the
[22:56] end time and it would take the end time
[22:58] message to wake up that seed
[23:01] and it wasn't something you had the
[23:04] power to do yourself it wasn't something
[23:06] you've done for yourself we had no power
[23:08] to do this for ourselves amen there was
[23:11] already the capacity to believe placed
[23:13] down inside and it was waiting to come
[23:16] in contact with something amen that
[23:18] would Quicken it to life and bring it
[23:20] into manifestation
[23:22] and you being part of God Amen that's
[23:26] back before back before the beginning
[23:29] you were part of God Amen back before
[23:32] you were part of his thoughts and
[23:34] because you're part of his thoughts
[23:36] you're part of his word amen because a
[23:38] word is a thought expressed so you were
[23:40] always part of God
[23:42] you had because you were being part of
[23:44] God you had to be part of the word amen
[23:47] so that makes you part of the word
[23:52] all right
[23:53] so then he says I want to repeat this
[23:56] last sentence you were always the seed
[23:58] was in you always
[24:01] the word seen the word that was in you
[24:05] so the word for this day seemed the word
[24:08] that was in you
[24:10] that was before the foundation of the
[24:11] world saw the word and you came to it
[24:14] these two pieces came together because
[24:16] they're two pieces of the same thing
[24:18] amen they're magnetized to one another
[24:21] because they come from the same Source
[24:23] amen and they were magnetized to each
[24:25] other so you saw the word let's look at
[24:27] First Peter chapter one
[24:32] foreign
[24:33] chapter 1 verse 23.
[24:46] so First Peter 1 and 23 being born again
[24:50] not of corruptable seed but of
[24:53] Incorruptible your first birth was a
[24:56] corruptable seed it was corrupted in the
[24:58] Garden of Eden
[24:59] but your second birth comes by an
[25:01] Incorruptible seed that was already in
[25:04] you
[25:05] being born again not of corruptable seed
[25:07] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[25:10] what's the mechanism that brings this
[25:12] seed to life it's the word of God Amen
[25:14] you're born again not of corruptable
[25:16] seed not not another birth like your
[25:19] first birthday amen this is going to be
[25:20] a spiritual birth not by corruptable
[25:22] seed but by Incorruptible seed by the
[25:26] word of God the word of God is going to
[25:28] bring this new birth to The
[25:29] Incorruptible seed that was where that
[25:32] was always in you amen when did he put
[25:34] it in you before the foundation of the
[25:36] world Amen
[25:37] and so now he would use the mechanism of
[25:39] the word to bring The Incorruptible seed
[25:41] to life so you cannot be born again
[25:43] without the sea Gene of God Amen it's
[25:46] the sieging of God that's quickened to
[25:48] Life by the word of God that is the new
[25:50] birth
[25:51] praise be to God and to be part of that
[25:54] means you are part of God to be part of
[25:57] that means you're part of the word amen
[25:59] and to be part of the word means you you
[26:01] never can be lost because he's not going
[26:03] to lose the word he's not going to lose
[26:05] himself he had a plan for you and I amen
[26:08] and that that plan as a Plan of
[26:11] Redemption and we were never in Jeopardy
[26:13] of being forever separated from God
[26:16] because God had a plan God knew what he
[26:19] would do and God God would not lose
[26:21] himself
[26:22] remember you're part of God Amen and
[26:24] when we start to talk about these things
[26:26] it's important that we realize which we
[26:29] all realize every one of us realize that
[26:31] the man you look at in the mirror is not
[26:33] the one we're talking about that's the
[26:35] one that's part of that corruptable seed
[26:37] by corruptable birth that's the one we
[26:40] wrestle with that's our enemy amen
[26:42] that's the one that that gives us
[26:44] trouble amen but we're talking about the
[26:46] the real you the sea you the that that
[26:49] what God intended to be you from the
[26:51] beginning that inner man amen that's
[26:53] been brought to life by the word
[26:55] that's the part that was with God Amen
[26:58] the very Gene of God the very uh word of
[27:01] God Amen that's the part that we're
[27:03] talking about and and if we don't if we
[27:06] don't keep these things separated amen
[27:08] we begin to look at at flesh and flesh
[27:10] beings and flesh mistakes and we begin
[27:13] to think this could never be me amen
[27:15] don't look at the man in the mirror look
[27:17] in the mirror of the word and look at
[27:19] the reflection in the mirror of the word
[27:20] and then you'll find yourself amen not
[27:22] in your mirror but in the mirror of the
[27:24] word is where you'll find your identity
[27:27] it goes deeper than the flesh amen
[27:30] in future home the prophet says Satan
[27:32] sin and sinners has gone forever it's
[27:35] all done blended into eternity and all
[27:38] that was perverted that great Archangel
[27:40] that set there one day Satan that did
[27:42] all this evil will be destroyed you
[27:45] remember the Bible said if that Soul
[27:46] won't do as he did said do he will even
[27:49] destroy that Soul do you see he can't
[27:52] destroy himself and remain God
[27:56] so if that soul is of the world it has
[27:58] to be destroyed but if it's Eternal with
[28:01] God it never did begin because it's part
[28:03] of God and can never be destroyed amen
[28:07] if the seeding of God was in you that
[28:10] Soul can never be destroyed amen because
[28:13] God cannot destroy himself and remain
[28:16] God
[28:18] so our Salvation is secure
[28:23] it's very secure
[28:25] amen but I want to look at Salvation in
[28:27] a broader sense and not just for the
[28:28] bride I want to start here so that we
[28:30] understand where we fit into the picture
[28:32] of God we know that we're saved by grace
[28:35] through faith and that not of ourselves
[28:37] it is a gift of God not of Works lest
[28:40] any man should boast so God made it
[28:42] really clear for us that it was nothing
[28:44] you did it's what he did amen it wasn't
[28:47] your Works your efforts your decisions
[28:49] none of that amen is what brought you
[28:51] salvation but you're saved by grace
[28:53] through faith because you were able to
[28:56] believe the word and that was not of
[28:58] yourselves that was a gift of God so
[29:00] that is not of work so there's no
[29:02] boasting whatsoever amen this Revelation
[29:05] should bring the bride into a genuine
[29:07] humility recognizing I'm not special
[29:10] because I'm special amen I'm special
[29:13] because he chose me before the
[29:14] foundation of the world and placed
[29:16] something in me amen that I had nothing
[29:18] to do with
[29:21] that's what brings such a devotion out
[29:23] of the Bride when we see what he did for
[29:25] us amen what he did for us separated
[29:28] from our own efforts and our own merits
[29:30] he did it anyways it was his choosing it
[29:33] was his thought before the foundation of
[29:34] the world not mine and through all my
[29:37] blunders and all my mistakes and all my
[29:39] backslidings and families it has never
[29:41] changed God's plan
[29:44] what what a love and what a devotion is
[29:47] in our hearts
[29:48] because of that
[29:51] but I want to look at
[29:53] uh
[29:55] the the Judgment of the world those that
[29:58] are not bride those that are not sieging
[30:01] of God they're not Eternal thoughts of
[30:04] God we've been through this before but
[30:06] it does it's it's something worth
[30:08] looking at because it's so so unique to
[30:12] the message to the teaching of a prophet
[30:14] in our day that's different than every
[30:16] other teaching that's out there in
[30:17] Christian circles
[30:19] you know the people before have accused
[30:22] the message of being exclusive
[30:24] but really when you look at it through
[30:26] the teachings of the prophet in our day
[30:28] when he brings us back to the scripture
[30:30] it's the most inclusive teaching I've
[30:32] ever seen in my life
[30:34] there is more Mercy amen demonstrated to
[30:37] the message of the hour than I have seen
[30:39] through any other teaching of any other
[30:41] denomination anywhere else in any other
[30:44] Christian circles amen and it shows the
[30:47] true nature of God Amen because God is a
[30:50] Creator amen God is love and God is just
[30:53] and righteous in everything that he does
[30:55] and this message shows God that way amen
[30:59] and so no matter what the what what no
[31:02] matter what accusations are out there
[31:04] they're completely unfounded amen God
[31:07] has a bride he has a bride of his own
[31:09] choosing that's not our fault
[31:13] it's not even because we say so it's
[31:15] because the word says so amen it's not
[31:18] what we say it's what he said it's not
[31:20] what we made up it's what he determined
[31:23] before the foundation of the world it's
[31:25] not our fault that God's heart purpose
[31:27] was to have a bride of his own choosing
[31:30] that's not the fault of the Bride it's
[31:32] not the fault of those that receive this
[31:33] word amen so so there's no there's no
[31:36] blame that's going to be penned on us
[31:38] because we didn't call ourselves we
[31:40] didn't give ourselves faith we didn't
[31:42] send the word in this day we never sent
[31:43] a prophet we never worked all the signs
[31:46] and miracles through him we didn't have
[31:47] the clouds show up we didn't have the
[31:49] light the pillar of fire with the
[31:50] picture taken in Houston we didn't do
[31:52] any of this he did it all and we never
[31:54] decided he decided and he drew us amen
[31:58] and he called us and he put a seed
[32:00] inside of us to receive the word it was
[32:02] all him not us
[32:05] so we have the devil's answer to every
[32:07] accusation it's not me it's him I didn't
[32:09] do this he did this and you know people
[32:12] will say well you think you're this I
[32:14] don't think I'm anything amen I'm just
[32:16] receiving by faith what he's given me to
[32:18] receive I can't help it
[32:23] I didn't wake up one day and said I'm
[32:25] deciding I'm going to be the Bride of
[32:27] Jesus Christ because that sounds like a
[32:29] lot of fun
[32:31] I I wasn't looking to be a bride of
[32:34] Jesus Christ I was going to a church a
[32:37] church that I had been a system that
[32:39] I've been raised in all of my life and I
[32:41] just wanted to be a good boy and I
[32:43] wanted to do the minimum to get to
[32:45] heaven
[32:46] unfortunately that was the way I was
[32:48] living that day
[32:51] but God found me God found you
[32:55] God sent this word god am entitled all
[32:59] the loose sins together God manifest his
[33:02] word and God revealed his word and God
[33:04] planted a seed in you before the
[33:06] foundation of the world that would
[33:08] recognize it as true
[33:11] so there's there's no guilt and no shame
[33:15] and that there's no responsibility in us
[33:19] the responsibility was in God
[33:22] all we do is receive it by faith
[33:25] and confess it because we believe it
[33:29] so no matter what anybody says it's not
[33:32] our fault
[33:33] no matter what anybody says to you or an
[33:35] accusation or an attitude
[33:37] it's not our fault
[33:39] I didn't have anything to do with it
[33:42] I was just breathing in and out
[33:46] and living the best life I knew how to
[33:48] live and he intercepted me
[33:52] he called me he revealed himself to me
[33:55] and he had already planted something in
[33:58] me that would say I don't understand
[34:00] that I I can't figure it out but I know
[34:03] it's the truth
[34:05] and that was that seed of faith
[34:08] so now let's look at how God deals with
[34:11] the rest of humanity in the in the
[34:15] message things that are to be he says
[34:17] now before we open the Bible now anybody
[34:19] that's got physical strength can open in
[34:21] this manner but it takes the Holy Spirit
[34:23] to open the word to US Open our
[34:24] understanding and reveal the scriptures
[34:27] I believe in the Bible I believe that
[34:29] it's God's word I believe that the Earth
[34:31] or the peoples of the earth will be
[34:33] judged Someday by this word
[34:36] this is so important that that brother
[34:39] bam says the the the
[34:41] Earth the peoples of the earth will be
[34:43] judged by his word amen and we know that
[34:46] Jesus Christ is the word of God it tells
[34:49] us so in John 1 1 amen and in the
[34:52] beginning was the word and the Word was
[34:53] with God and the Word was God and all
[34:55] things were made by him and we know that
[34:58] that word was eventually made flesh unto
[34:59] and among us we know that Christ is the
[35:02] anointed word amen and so so the Earth
[35:05] will be judged that's why Jesus Christ
[35:07] will judge the Earth but it's also why
[35:10] the Saints will judge the Earth because
[35:12] they are part of Christ
[35:14] they will sit with him on his throne
[35:16] they will sit with him in his judgment
[35:18] they will judge the world they will
[35:20] judge Angels amen because they are part
[35:23] of Christ because they are part of the
[35:25] word
[35:26] all right but the the world then the
[35:30] Earth the inhabitants of the Earth the
[35:32] peoples of the earth will be judged by
[35:34] the word
[35:36] let's go to John chapter 5.
[35:50] John chapter 5 verse 24.
[35:55] verily verily I say unto you he that
[35:58] heareth my word and believeth on him
[36:00] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[36:03] shall not come into condemnation that
[36:05] word condemnation is translated the
[36:07] majority of the times in the New
[36:09] Testament as judgment shall not come
[36:11] into the Judgment but is passed from
[36:14] Death unto life
[36:17] so those that believe Christ
[36:21] in whatever way and whatever day Christ
[36:23] is presented
[36:25] they have passed from death into life
[36:28] there is now no judgment there is no
[36:31] judgment they already he says he says uh
[36:35] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[36:37] him that sent me
[36:38] half everlasting life
[36:41] you already have it it's in the seed
[36:45] I mean that's why you could believe in
[36:47] the day and age that you live when you
[36:49] encounter Christ in your day you can
[36:51] believe because you already have
[36:52] everlasting life you shall not come into
[36:54] the Judgment but you've passed from
[36:56] death into life that's the position of
[36:58] the Bride she won't come into the
[37:00] Judgment at the white Throne judgment
[37:01] because she'll be sitting on the throne
[37:03] ministering to her husband Christ
[37:05] sitting with him in judgment judging the
[37:09] world
[37:10] right so we want to we want to look at
[37:13] that and questions and answers in 1964
[37:16] he says now then at this time the
[37:18] Gentile bride is in heaven and the
[37:20] sleeping virgin the Gentile virgin is
[37:22] not to be saved during that time she's
[37:24] already been saved but has been rejected
[37:26] in the bride and she'll only goes
[37:28] through the tribulation period for the
[37:30] time of purification because she has
[37:32] rejected Christ the word for her
[37:34] purification then she has to suffer for
[37:36] her Deeds
[37:38] but the bride who has become the word a
[37:42] complete atonement was made of Christ
[37:43] because he is the word that body was
[37:46] rendered and when that body was rendered
[37:48] the bride was in that body because it's
[37:51] all the word
[37:52] because if you're part of God then
[37:54] you're part of his word Christ is the
[37:56] anointed word you're part of Christ and
[37:58] when Jesus Christ was nailed to the
[38:00] cross and that body was rented the word
[38:02] was made flash if you're part of the
[38:04] word then you were there in that
[38:05] manifestation and when that word was
[38:07] bleeding amen you were there and
[38:09] included in it
[38:12] now there's no more punishment there's
[38:14] no more need for purification that was
[38:16] your purification and now we're washed
[38:19] in the bleeding word amen as the word
[38:21] comes forth and purifies the bride
[38:23] because we were there
[38:25] all right he says in the God of this
[38:27] evil age and when the entire word of God
[38:29] incomplete was headed up in a human body
[38:32] called Jesus Christ in there God made me
[38:36] pay for my sins in him there
[38:40] praise be to God when when he was paying
[38:42] for the sins of the world because I am
[38:45] part of God and part of the word when
[38:47] the word was made flesh and then became
[38:49] the price of redemption and was nailed
[38:52] to the cross and was punished for sin I
[38:54] was included there amen and so I'm a
[38:57] benefactor of that because I'm part of
[38:59] that word
[39:00] now there's no more coming to the
[39:03] Judgment it's already been judged
[39:06] there's no coming to the Judgment at the
[39:08] white don't judgment because I've passed
[39:10] from Death unto life passed Beyond
[39:12] judgment because it was already judged I
[39:14] paid for my sins there in him there
[39:17] so the bride is absolutely utterly and
[39:21] completely secure in Christ
[39:24] there's nothing to worry about there's
[39:26] nothing to fear there's nothing to bring
[39:28] anxiety everything's already settled
[39:31] paid for decided amen now we're walking
[39:34] in the plan of God to manifest the light
[39:36] he once manifest through Us in this day
[39:38] it's his doing if we just yield to his
[39:40] hand and relax everything's taken care
[39:43] of
[39:44] that's us
[39:46] so we are part of this word
[39:49] in the church age book and the Patmos
[39:51] vision
[39:52] and I'm going to say the disclaimer here
[39:55] don't wait for me to get wound up and
[39:56] start preaching I'm teaching this
[39:58] morning so stay with me you stay wound
[40:00] up because this is already my Pace all
[40:02] right
[40:03] stick with the word so don't wait for me
[40:05] to lay a foundation and get going uh
[40:07] we're going
[40:10] praise God
[40:11] the church age book he says then it goes
[40:13] on to say how God is going to judge men
[40:16] here it is in verse 5 to 17 the hard and
[40:19] impedant heart will be judged The Works
[40:22] will be judged the motives will be
[40:23] judged there won't be any respect before
[40:25] God but all will be judged by that word
[40:29] no one escaping him those who heard and
[40:32] wouldn't listen will be judged by what
[40:34] they heard those that rested in it
[40:36] saying they believed it but did not live
[40:38] it will be judged every secret will come
[40:41] out in the open and be shouted from the
[40:43] housetops oh we will really understand
[40:46] history then there won't be a mystery
[40:49] left from all the ages
[40:51] he's talking about the white Throne
[40:52] judgment and if we get a picture of this
[40:54] let's turn to the Book of Revelation
[40:55] chapter 20 and take a look at it in the
[40:59] Book of Revelation
[41:01] Revelation chapter 20 and verse 11.
[41:05] I
[41:13] Revelation 20 and 11 and I saw a great
[41:15] white throne in him that sat on him from
[41:17] whose face the earth and the heaven fled
[41:19] away there was found no place for them
[41:21] and I saw the dead small and great stand
[41:24] before God and the books were opened and
[41:27] another book was opened which is The
[41:28] Book of Life and the dead were judged
[41:31] out of those things which were written
[41:33] in the books according to their works
[41:35] and the Sea gave up the dead which were
[41:38] in it and death and Hell delivered up
[41:40] the dead which were in them and they
[41:42] were judged every man according to their
[41:44] works and death and hell were cast into
[41:46] the Lake of Fire this is the second
[41:48] death and whosoever was not found
[41:50] written in the Book of Life was cast
[41:52] into the Lake of Fire
[41:55] so we find in this judgment this white
[41:57] Throne judgment this takes place at the
[42:00] end of the millennial Reign after the
[42:02] Thousand-Year reign with Christ and his
[42:03] bride after the honeymoon there comes a
[42:06] white Throne judgment and in this
[42:07] judgment all the dead those that slept
[42:10] for the Thousand Years all the dead are
[42:12] resurrected and they stand before Christ
[42:14] and we know that the bride is present on
[42:16] the throne with Christ amen judging with
[42:18] him and and it says there was books
[42:22] opened and another book opened which is
[42:24] The Book of Life Amen in order to pass
[42:26] just judgment you have to have your name
[42:28] on The Book of Life
[42:30] but there's also other books and then
[42:34] these other books it says and the dead
[42:37] were judged out of those things which
[42:38] were written in the books according to
[42:41] their Works amen the bride is not judged
[42:43] according to her works for for her basis
[42:46] of Salvation she's judged according to
[42:48] the works that she did for rewards amen
[42:50] but never for condemnation amen but
[42:53] they're judged according to their Works
[42:55] amen there's something that they did or
[42:57] there's something that they didn't do
[42:59] amen and and I don't think that I don't
[43:02] think that in this judgment if you allow
[43:04] me just to uh uh just give maybe my own
[43:06] thinking I don't think that God is going
[43:09] to be standing there and says when you
[43:11] were five you kicked the dog and when
[43:13] you did this there's something in these
[43:15] books on these works that are
[43:16] determining where they go
[43:19] there's something in these books there's
[43:22] something that they did or something
[43:24] that they didn't do amen that's
[43:26] determining amen the
[43:28] Eternal destination whether they go to
[43:30] the lake of fire or they find entrants
[43:32] into life everlasting life life Beyond
[43:35] Time amen and so there's something's
[43:38] written down there's a record that's
[43:39] been taken and it will be disclosed in
[43:42] this judgment but there's also the book
[43:44] of life so they must be in the Book of
[43:45] Life and there's something written in
[43:47] the books amen and so we find out that
[43:51] this has nothing to do with the bride
[43:52] amen because because everything for us
[43:55] has already been paid for and taken care
[43:57] of we've already made it we're not
[43:59] trying to make it we're not hoping to
[44:00] make it we're not looking at works as a
[44:03] way in or a way out or I'm going to lose
[44:05] out or I'm going to make it that has
[44:07] already decided Works has nothing to do
[44:09] with that
[44:10] now our works is our love back to God
[44:14] because we love to serve him and love to
[44:16] do for him but it's never an attaining
[44:18] to a better position
[44:21] how do you get a better position than
[44:22] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:26] so let's look at John chapter 5 again
[44:29] let's go back to John chapter 5.
[44:38] John chapter 5.
[44:40] verse 28.
[44:47] John 5 and 28 Marvel not at this for the
[44:50] hours coming in which all that are in
[44:52] the graves shall hear his voice so this
[44:55] is not the resurrection this is not the
[44:57] Rapture this is everybody that's in the
[45:00] graves will hear his voice this is the
[45:02] second Resurrection unto judgment
[45:05] all right we together on that
[45:07] Marvel for this for the hours coming in
[45:09] which all that are in the grave shall
[45:10] hear his voice and shall come forth they
[45:13] that have done good unto resurrection of
[45:15] life and they that have done evil into
[45:17] the resurrection of damnation once again
[45:21] this is a judgment that has to do with
[45:23] their works and has to do with their
[45:25] deeds they that have done evil to
[45:27] damnation they that have done good unto
[45:29] life this is the general Resurrection at
[45:32] the end of the Thousand Years when all
[45:34] the dead stand before Christ and his
[45:36] bride and this judgment all will hear
[45:38] his voice and all will come forth out of
[45:40] the grave and it'll be a resurrection
[45:43] unto life or death it'll be a
[45:45] resurrection and a judgment amen those
[45:47] that have done evil and those that have
[45:49] done good
[45:50] I'm so thankful that we get to bypass
[45:53] this judgment
[45:55] I'm so thankful that I don't have to
[45:57] stand in a judgment that has to do with
[45:59] my Deeds
[46:01] I'm so thankful that that was already
[46:03] paid for Calvary for us we were already
[46:05] included in that my sins are absolved my
[46:08] sins are paid for Amen in my faith in
[46:10] the word is a testimony that I was a
[46:12] part of it in that day amen and I so
[46:15] thankful to God that I don't have to
[46:17] come in this judgment
[46:20] in the Smyrna I'm sorry sardisian Church
[46:23] age out of the church age book he said
[46:25] but it is even most accurately set forth
[46:27] in Psalm 69 that is the wicked or
[46:30] unrighteous rejecters of Christ and the
[46:33] Destroyers of his people whose names are
[46:35] removed he's talking about the removal
[46:37] from The Book of Life and he says we we
[46:39] we know this so well but in the book of
[46:42] life amen is a record of life there's
[46:45] names in The Book of Life that can be
[46:47] blotted out can be removed amen God
[46:49] speaks of this and we know Judas had his
[46:51] name recorded in heaven his name was
[46:53] part of the book of life but he rejected
[46:54] Christ his name was removed amen but
[46:57] there's a section of the Book of Life
[46:58] called The Eternal wheat seed section or
[47:01] the eternal life section amen and that
[47:03] is the section where God recorded his
[47:06] bride his seed genes and nothing will
[47:08] ever change in that section of the book
[47:10] no name can be blotted out and if you're
[47:13] part of his bride you were in that book
[47:15] and in that section of the book before
[47:16] the foundation of the world nothing can
[47:19] change
[47:20] you're not in jeopardy
[47:22] of losing anything amen
[47:25] but if you're in the general book of
[47:27] life that name can be blotted out what
[47:31] causes that name to be removed from the
[47:33] book of life it says it is the wicked or
[47:36] unrighteous rejecters of Christ
[47:39] and the Destroyers of his people whose
[47:42] names are removed
[47:43] who's removed those who reject Christ
[47:45] and remember Christ is the anointed word
[47:48] for your day
[47:50] they were rejecting Christ in Moses day
[47:54] even before Jesus Christ came into
[47:56] manifestation amen and and walked by the
[47:59] Sea of Galilee and come out of Nazareth
[48:01] there was Christ back there and there
[48:02] was those who were rejecting Christ in
[48:04] Moses day because he was that rock that
[48:06] followed them through the wilderness
[48:08] Christ has always been the anointed word
[48:10] for your day and and to reject that is
[48:13] considered evil that is evil Deeds not
[48:17] not you know not the evil things you did
[48:20] when you were a kid not the mischievous
[48:22] things those are all wrong those are all
[48:24] evil we understand that not not you
[48:26] cheated on your taxes and not all of
[48:28] those that's not the list of things that
[48:30] I think we're going to read amen we're
[48:31] going to read what did you do with the
[48:33] word because the judgment is based off
[48:35] the word all judgment is based off this
[48:38] word amen what did you do with this word
[48:42] what did you do with this word called
[48:44] Christ
[48:47] that's what this judgment is based off
[48:49] of
[48:53] he says
[48:55] I'll read this again it's the wicked or
[48:57] unrighteous rejecters of Christ and the
[49:00] Destroyers of his people whose names are
[49:02] removed
[49:03] as Israel the chosen people of God in
[49:05] majority forfeited their rights in the
[49:07] Book of Life by rejecting Jesus so the
[49:10] majority of the Gentile church was also
[49:12] come into condemnation with the
[49:14] resultant removal of their names from
[49:16] The Book of Life by rejecting the word
[49:18] and thereby entering into the world
[49:20] ecumenical movement which is the image
[49:23] erected into the Beast
[49:25] what are these evil or righteous Deeds
[49:29] you know growing up I can just tell you
[49:32] growing up in denominational circles
[49:34] amen we get we get such ideas you know
[49:37] we get all these ideas that the
[49:39] righteous deed is helping the little old
[49:41] lady across the street and the
[49:42] unrighteous deed is stealing from work
[49:45] and those are righteous and unrighteous
[49:47] Deeds amen but it's much much deeper
[49:49] than that because it's what did you do
[49:51] with the word that was presented to you
[49:53] amen that it there's there's something
[49:55] that God is looking for and there's
[49:57] something by which God is basing his
[49:59] judgment on and he's basing it on the
[50:02] word amen
[50:03] you can be ever so nice and do
[50:06] everything so nice and do everything so
[50:08] right and still not pass this judgment
[50:11] you can be kind to everybody you can do
[50:14] great charitable deeds and great works
[50:16] you can never take what's not yours
[50:18] never speak evil of anybody you can do
[50:20] all those things right and still not
[50:22] pass this judgment because this judgment
[50:24] is a judgment based on the word
[50:29] let's go to Matthew 25.
[50:32] we all know
[50:34] most of us as anyways know this really
[50:37] well
[50:38] there's such a picture painted in
[50:40] Matthew 25 of what we're looking at
[50:44] this is also the scene of the white
[50:47] Throne judgment Matthew 25 31.
[50:54] Matthew 25 and 31 when the son of man
[50:57] shall come in his glory and all the Holy
[50:59] Angels with him then shall he sit upon
[51:01] the throne of his glory and before him
[51:03] shall be gathered all the nations and he
[51:05] shall separate them one from another as
[51:08] a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the
[51:09] goats now now brother Ben I'm in the
[51:12] church age book he explains to us where
[51:14] it says He Shall Gather All Nations and
[51:16] shall separate them one from another as
[51:19] a Shepherd divided the sheep from the
[51:21] ghost He says these are not sheep
[51:24] in this judgment the sheep have already
[51:26] been gathered into the fold the Sheep
[51:28] are the children of God they are sitting
[51:30] with him on the throne this is just an
[51:32] analogy it's dividing the same way a
[51:36] Shepherd would divide sheep and goats
[51:37] this is not the separation of the sheep
[51:39] and the ghost the sheep have already
[51:40] been separated out
[51:42] the sheep or the Sheep of God Amen and
[51:45] he's already redeemed those sheep he's
[51:46] already called those sheep and we're
[51:48] already sitting with him in the throne
[51:50] this is just an analogy he's separating
[51:53] as a Shepherd would separate sheep and
[51:56] goats
[51:58] praise be to God
[52:00] that drives back so much confusion
[52:03] because because it looks like these are
[52:05] the Sheep these are the the children
[52:07] have gone and these are ghosts they're
[52:08] not children of God no no no the the
[52:10] seed of God have already been gathered
[52:12] home amen this is everybody else
[52:16] verse 33 and he shall set the sheep on
[52:18] his right hand but the goats on the left
[52:20] then shall the king say unto them on his
[52:23] right hand come you blessed of my father
[52:25] inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
[52:27] from the foundation of the world for I
[52:29] was a hungered and you gave me meat I
[52:32] was thirsty and you gave me drink I was
[52:35] a stranger and you took me in naked and
[52:37] you clothed me I was sick and you
[52:39] visited me I was in prison and you came
[52:41] unto me
[52:43] then shall the righteous answer him
[52:45] saying Lord when saw we thee a hungered
[52:47] and fed thee are thirsty and gave thee
[52:49] drink when saw we thee a stranger and
[52:51] took the Inn or naked and clothed thee
[52:54] our wind saw we be sick or in prison and
[52:56] came unto thee and the King shall answer
[52:59] and say unto them verily I say unto you
[53:01] and so much as you have done it unto one
[53:03] of the least of these my brethren you
[53:05] have done it unto me
[53:09] Jesus was not saying with the crowd
[53:11] before him
[53:13] sheep and goats he was not saying as
[53:16] you've done it to the least of these in
[53:17] my breath no he was pointing to the ones
[53:19] that were sitting with him on the throne
[53:21] as you've done it to the least of these
[53:24] my brethren that are with me you've done
[53:26] it unto me because they are part of me
[53:28] because they are part of the word
[53:29] because they are part of Christ and as
[53:31] you did it to the least of these my
[53:33] brethren you did it unto me
[53:35] this is the same Revelation Paul got on
[53:37] the road to Damascus when the pillar of
[53:39] fire struck him down and he says boss
[53:41] all Saul why why amen persecute is thou
[53:45] me and he says Lord who are you that I'm
[53:47] Jesus whom you persecuted amen and he
[53:50] was Jesus in the form of his church he
[53:52] was touching the church but he was
[53:54] persecuting Jesus because the pillar of
[53:56] fire was in the church
[53:59] amen and they come into the church at
[54:01] Pentecost when Christ Divine himself and
[54:04] the spirit of Christ entered into the
[54:06] people and now Paul realized when I was
[54:08] hauling them to prison and I was beating
[54:10] them I was holding Christ to prison and
[54:12] I was beating Christ and these were the
[54:14] manifested word and now Paul found
[54:16] himself guilty against the word amen
[54:20] and now all down through time amen the
[54:23] anointed word Christ for every day has
[54:25] been manifest in his bride in the True
[54:28] Vine in the people of God Amen and the
[54:31] people are being judged in this judgment
[54:33] here on how they reacted to Christ amen
[54:37] because when you did it to the least of
[54:39] these my brother you did it to me and
[54:41] now you're entering into life because
[54:43] when I was naked you clothed me when I
[54:45] was hungry you fed me when I when I was
[54:46] sick you came to me they said Lord when
[54:49] did we do this they didn't even realize
[54:50] that they were serving the lord
[54:52] they didn't even know that this was the
[54:55] Lord they were doing something without
[54:57] full knowledge of what they were doing
[54:59] but the very actions Deeds The Works the
[55:02] things that are written in the book amen
[55:04] are coming up at the white Throne
[55:05] judgment and now they're being separated
[55:07] out and told this is why you're
[55:09] separated out and this is why you're
[55:11] coming into life
[55:15] because it's not about people
[55:18] it's about the word
[55:21] it's not about our flesh it's not
[55:23] because somebody was nice to you because
[55:25] you have pretty blue eyes and you have a
[55:27] nice part in your hair that has nothing
[55:28] to do with it it's how they treat the
[55:30] word that's living in you
[55:33] how they treat Christ that's living in
[55:36] his body his body is on Earth and his
[55:39] body is the true church is the bride and
[55:42] when they come in contact with a part of
[55:43] that body and they interact with the
[55:45] living word amen that record is what's
[55:48] being brought up now is that interaction
[55:50] with that word in their day
[55:52] because he's judging by the word amen
[55:55] it's not it's not uh it's not it's not
[55:59] the flesh part it's not the trivial part
[56:01] amen it's deeper than that it's not you
[56:04] because of your parentage you because of
[56:06] your temperament you because of this
[56:08] it's because you've been United with
[56:10] Christ because the seed has come alive
[56:12] because you're part of the manifested
[56:14] word for your day and that interaction
[56:16] with that word is determining something
[56:18] for eternity
[56:21] and remember well
[56:23] let's go on and read and then we'll come
[56:25] back
[56:28] 41 then shall I say also unto them on
[56:31] the left hand depart from me
[56:33] you curse it unto Everlasting fire
[56:35] prepared for the devil and his angels
[56:36] for I was a hungered and you gave me no
[56:39] meat I was thirsty and you gave me no
[56:41] drink I was a stranger and you took me
[56:43] not in naked and you clothed me not sick
[56:46] and in prison and you visited me not
[56:47] then shall they also answer him saying
[56:50] Lord wind saw we the hungered or a
[56:53] thirst or stranger or naked or sick or
[56:56] in prison and did not Minister unto thee
[56:58] then shall he answer them saying verily
[57:00] I say unto you in so much as you did it
[57:02] not to one of the least of these you did
[57:05] it not to me
[57:06] and these shall go away into Everlasting
[57:09] punishment but the righteous and to life
[57:12] eternal
[57:14] what made their deeds evil
[57:16] how they treated the Manifest the word
[57:19] what made them righteous by how they
[57:21] reacted to the manifested word
[57:24] God is judging by his word
[57:30] he says in the sardestian church age
[57:34] the first resurrection has nothing to do
[57:36] with the second death
[57:37] that is at the end of the Thousand Year
[57:39] when all the rest of the Dead live again
[57:41] and that day there will be those who
[57:43] come forth to eternal life and those
[57:44] others who are caught in the second
[57:46] death now we do not need to guess about
[57:48] those in the second Resurrection those
[57:51] who in the second Resurrection are given
[57:53] life we are told it is given to them on
[57:55] the grounds that they have been kind and
[57:57] good to the Brethren those who are
[58:00] raised and cast into the Lake of Fire
[58:01] will be so treated because of their
[58:03] mistreatment of the brethren
[58:05] since this is the word of God we simply
[58:07] accept it there is no argument here just
[58:10] a simple statement of fact
[58:13] to further clarify notice specifically
[58:15] the words of Matthew 25 31-46 which is
[58:18] what we just read it does not say that a
[58:21] Shepherd is literally separating sheep
[58:22] from goats but it is as a Shepherd
[58:24] divided sheep from goats these are not
[58:26] sheep in this particular area of time
[58:28] white Throne judgment the Sheep are in
[58:30] his fold they heard his voice word and
[58:33] they followed him they already have
[58:35] eternal life and cannot come into the
[58:37] Judgment but these do not have eternal
[58:39] life and they are in the Judgment they
[58:41] are allowed to go into eternal life but
[58:44] upon what grounds do they enter into
[58:46] life eternal certainly not upon the fact
[58:48] that they already have his life as does
[58:51] the bride but they receive it because
[58:53] they were kind to his Brethren they are
[58:56] not his Brethren that would make them
[58:58] join heirs with Jesus they are not heirs
[59:00] to anything but life they share No
[59:02] Throne Etc with them their names must
[59:04] have been in the Book of Life and not
[59:06] removed now because of their love of the
[59:09] people of God they are recognized and
[59:12] saved
[59:14] because of what they do with the word
[59:19] he judges by the word everything is
[59:22] based off the word no doubt they served
[59:26] and helped the children of God perhaps
[59:27] like Nicodemus and Gamaliel they stood
[59:30] for the children in time of trouble
[59:33] he says if this seems the smack of
[59:35] restoration watch carefully now for the
[59:37] wicked are not restored but turned into
[59:40] the Lake of Fire the names of many of
[59:42] those destroyed were in The Book of Life
[59:43] also but they were blotted out because
[59:45] they failed to honor the people of God
[59:48] who were the Living manifested Word
[59:51] living Epistles for their day
[59:54] what what made them righteous and what
[59:57] made them evil what Deeds were wrong and
[1:00:00] what Deeds were right amen it's not a
[1:00:03] list of good boy deeds and bad boy Deeds
[1:00:05] it's how they reacted to the word that
[1:00:07] they encountered
[1:00:09] because he is the word and the word is
[1:00:11] his thought expressed so when you
[1:00:13] encounter the word you're encountering
[1:00:15] an expression of God and it's not really
[1:00:17] how you deal with these bodies of Flesh
[1:00:20] these clay Tabernacles that you see it's
[1:00:22] how you deal with God that is
[1:00:24] tabernacled in the clay Tabernacles how
[1:00:27] you interact with the word and whatever
[1:00:29] measure you come in contact with the
[1:00:31] word of God the way you deal with that
[1:00:33] word is the way you deal with God and
[1:00:35] the way you deal with God is the way
[1:00:36] that he deals with you in judgment
[1:00:39] it's about the word it's about God
[1:00:41] Almighty because God is the word amen
[1:00:44] the word was with God the word was gone
[1:00:46] amen God's life is in the word God's
[1:00:49] thoughts and men have come forth they've
[1:00:52] been declared by word it's himself in
[1:00:54] word form and now to reject that when it
[1:00:57] comes into manifestation is to reject
[1:00:59] almighty God
[1:01:01] and then we think we can get a pass at
[1:01:03] the white Throne judgment because I
[1:01:05] attended church and I paid tithes and I
[1:01:07] and I took care of my grandma and I took
[1:01:09] care of the elderly people across the
[1:01:10] street and I and I was part of this club
[1:01:13] and I was part of it no what did you do
[1:01:15] with God how did you treat God how did
[1:01:17] you react to God
[1:01:20] not social niceness not not socially
[1:01:23] accepted forms of righteousness and
[1:01:25] goodness but what is the goodness and
[1:01:27] righteousness God's looking at he's
[1:01:29] looking at how you react to him how you
[1:01:31] love him how you respect or honor him
[1:01:35] and he is manifested in the day and age
[1:01:37] you live in as the word may manifest
[1:01:40] that is God manifesting revealing
[1:01:43] himself in the way we interact with that
[1:01:46] is the way we interact with God
[1:01:55] he goes on to say the church age book
[1:01:57] thus if God has so designed that there
[1:01:59] be those whose names are placed in the
[1:02:01] section of the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:02:03] cannot be erased for their names of his
[1:02:05] bride then we must accept that if it
[1:02:08] also states that there are those whose
[1:02:10] names were placed in the record of book
[1:02:11] of life but in the foreknowledge of God
[1:02:13] they were to fall and have their names
[1:02:15] removed we must accept that and if there
[1:02:18] are those whose names were never placed
[1:02:19] upon the record of life we must accept
[1:02:21] that also and if there are those who
[1:02:24] will enter into life eternal after the
[1:02:26] white Throne judgment solely on the
[1:02:29] grounds of being good and kind and just
[1:02:31] to the elect of God who are his Brethren
[1:02:32] then we cannot but accept that
[1:02:36] I accept it
[1:02:38] and I'm thankful for it
[1:02:41] I thank God Amen that God has made a way
[1:02:44] of Escape for numerous people I thank
[1:02:47] God for those who are not even see genes
[1:02:50] of himself or not even part of his
[1:02:51] children he has made a way that they can
[1:02:53] enter into life Eminem I'm so thankful
[1:02:56] that God Amen God had so much love God
[1:02:59] had so much grace amen for us and for
[1:03:02] for anybody attached to us that he knew
[1:03:05] amen my seed will need help in the
[1:03:07] future so I'm going to write a name in
[1:03:10] The Book of Life in this name that I'm
[1:03:12] writing in The Book of Life may not ever
[1:03:14] be a church member may not ever be a
[1:03:16] preacher may not ever testify or confess
[1:03:18] or be baptized but I wrote their name
[1:03:20] here because one of my seed genes are
[1:03:23] going to need help one day and this is
[1:03:25] the person that's going to stand for
[1:03:26] them and if they'll never reject my word
[1:03:29] and stay true to that I will grant them
[1:03:31] entrance into life Everlasting
[1:03:34] what a God we serve what a message this
[1:03:37] is friends this isn't an exclusive
[1:03:39] message this is an inclusive message
[1:03:41] amen this is God reaching out to anybody
[1:03:44] that will respect him anybody that will
[1:03:46] honor him anybody that will hold him
[1:03:49] Amen in esteem he will likewise hold
[1:03:52] them in his name
[1:03:56] so no matter what anybody tells you
[1:03:58] exclusive and this and that and
[1:04:00] everybody is not in the brightest out
[1:04:02] that is so far from the truth friend
[1:04:05] that is so far from the reality that God
[1:04:08] and His grace and God in his Mercy he's
[1:04:10] made a way for multitudes
[1:04:12] he's made a way from multitudes to be in
[1:04:16] the new heavens and the new Earth to
[1:04:18] dwell to live to live in Perfection to
[1:04:20] live in harmony amen than the selves to
[1:04:23] receive a perfect body Amen to live when
[1:04:25] there's no sin when there's no
[1:04:27] unrighteousness when there's no
[1:04:28] ungodliness when there's no death when
[1:04:30] there's no time they're allowed to enter
[1:04:32] into that not because they have eternal
[1:04:34] life we have eternal life because we're
[1:04:36] part of God's life they're allowed to
[1:04:38] come into life with no more time which
[1:04:41] is eternal life
[1:04:43] not having previously possessed it but
[1:04:46] allowed to enter in because God is
[1:04:48] gracious because God is merciful because
[1:04:50] God's plan is bigger than man's plan
[1:04:54] God's Mercy is greater than man's Mercy
[1:05:02] oh God is good
[1:05:06] we've talked before on this subject
[1:05:07] we've talked about the the the city
[1:05:11] dwellers in the New Jerusalem are the
[1:05:13] elect of God the deceiting of God
[1:05:16] they live in that city they're allowed
[1:05:18] to to dwell there amen because it's all
[1:05:21] God everything that's dwelling there is
[1:05:23] God as he's made himself manifest and
[1:05:25] come into flesh Through Time
[1:05:27] but the gates of the city are never
[1:05:30] closed
[1:05:31] no one who goes into the new heavens and
[1:05:34] new earth are shut out of this city they
[1:05:37] may not be part of the city but they're
[1:05:39] allowed to come in and out as they
[1:05:41] please amen why because they served the
[1:05:44] word in their life because they serve
[1:05:46] their word in their life they have
[1:05:48] access to the word all the time in the
[1:05:50] new heavens and new earth
[1:05:53] and I wonder how many
[1:05:55] how many sweet reunions will be there
[1:05:59] as those outside the city come in and
[1:06:02] out and in and out and we meet them and
[1:06:04] fellowship with them and talk to them
[1:06:06] and are so thankful that this message
[1:06:09] wasn't exclusive
[1:06:12] so thankful that God's plan was so rich
[1:06:15] in Mercy that he would allow somebody
[1:06:18] entrance into this life solely
[1:06:22] solely because they were good and kind
[1:06:24] to the brethren
[1:06:27] praise be to God
[1:06:30] let's go to Mark chapter 9.
[1:06:45] Mark chapter 9.
[1:06:49] and verse 41.
[1:06:56] for whosoever shall give you a cup of
[1:06:58] water to drink in my name because you
[1:07:00] belong to Christ verily I say unto you
[1:07:03] he shall not lose his reward
[1:07:06] Jesus is looking at something
[1:07:09] as minor as a cup of cold water
[1:07:13] but because you belong to Christ and
[1:07:16] they do it because you're in the Name of
[1:07:17] Christ
[1:07:19] that little deed won't lose its reward
[1:07:23] God keeps Good Records I believe that's
[1:07:26] what's wrote in that book those books
[1:07:28] that are opened at the white Throne
[1:07:30] judgment
[1:07:31] in perfect Faith the prophet of God says
[1:07:35] Jesus had perfect faith and it come and
[1:07:39] it came because he was the word and you
[1:07:42] become the word you become the word as
[1:07:45] you receive the word
[1:07:47] so as we receive this word we become the
[1:07:49] word because this word brings The
[1:07:51] Incorruptible seed to life and begins to
[1:07:54] manifest the life of the word and that
[1:07:56] word on display amen is Christ and it
[1:08:00] gives people an opportunity
[1:08:04] uh let's look at Romans chapter 8.
[1:08:11] Romans chapter 8.
[1:08:14] verse 11.
[1:08:21] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:08:23] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:08:25] raised Christ that from the dead shall
[1:08:26] also Quicken your mortal bodies by a
[1:08:29] spirit that dwelleth in you God is
[1:08:32] actually by the Spirit dwelling you he's
[1:08:34] quickening your mortal body to manifest
[1:08:36] his word
[1:08:38] he's taking control amen he's quickened
[1:08:40] the seed inside of you but he's also
[1:08:42] quickening this body Amen to come to the
[1:08:44] life of the word to Manifest this word
[1:08:46] out of this body because that's
[1:08:49] somebody's linked to God Amen that is
[1:08:51] somebody's connection to Christ because
[1:08:53] they said when did we serve you when did
[1:08:56] we feed you when did we do this he said
[1:08:58] when you did it to the least of my
[1:09:00] brethren that was the flesh that was the
[1:09:03] interaction point you had to interact
[1:09:05] with the word
[1:09:07] and because of that
[1:09:09] receive life Everlasting entrance into
[1:09:12] eternal life
[1:09:14] and so God is quickening by his spirit
[1:09:17] this flesh to manifest his word and the
[1:09:20] message the Harvest time he said in that
[1:09:22] day Luke 17 20 I believe it is Jesus
[1:09:25] said when the son of man is being
[1:09:26] revealed not man the son of man not an
[1:09:29] organization the son of man the word
[1:09:31] living itself again among the people see
[1:09:33] the word itself made flesh in you
[1:09:38] you are the reflection of this hour the
[1:09:41] message I'm in reflection of it see you
[1:09:44] live again live the life that was in
[1:09:46] Christ Jesus so where is the word on
[1:09:49] display it's in display and you and I
[1:09:51] amen and some of the some of these
[1:09:53] individuals will receive entrance into
[1:09:56] eternal life and they'll say when Lord
[1:09:58] when did we do this when did we do that
[1:10:00] I mean they didn't even know they were
[1:10:02] righteous they didn't even know the
[1:10:04] righteous Deeds were going to enter them
[1:10:05] in they didn't even know what they were
[1:10:07] doing for the Lord and to say when you
[1:10:09] did it to these my brethren
[1:10:11] you've done it unto me
[1:10:13] because we are the word made flesh
[1:10:16] and Christ The Mystery of God who really
[1:10:17] says notice now down Through the Ages he
[1:10:20] is gradually letting this out slowly
[1:10:21] unfolding the mystery through the
[1:10:23] prophets through the times now we can
[1:10:25] just go on and express himself he
[1:10:27] expresses himself in Moses look at Moses
[1:10:30] born in the time of persecution of
[1:10:32] children he was born to be a deliverer
[1:10:33] he was hidden the bull rushes just like
[1:10:36] Jesus was so he's showing all the way
[1:10:38] through there was a manifestation of
[1:10:40] Christ in Moses there was a
[1:10:41] manifestation of Christ and David a
[1:10:43] manifestation of Christ in Jeremiah amen
[1:10:46] what was it it was a spirit of God
[1:10:47] working through these men manifesting
[1:10:50] the word for their season amen and what
[1:10:52] people did with that word determined how
[1:10:55] they were judged
[1:11:00] so we know
[1:11:03] that
[1:11:05] the mystery is Christ in you
[1:11:07] the hope of glory
[1:11:10] but all
[1:11:12] what hinges on Christ in you
[1:11:18] what of Eternal consequence
[1:11:22] is hinging on Christ in you
[1:11:26] God
[1:11:27] wrote in a book of life before the
[1:11:30] foundation of the world names
[1:11:32] and he tells us through the prophet that
[1:11:35] no names are being added to this record
[1:11:37] it was sealed before the foundation of
[1:11:39] the world there's not another name being
[1:11:41] added so whatever name is found on the
[1:11:44] book of life was placed there before the
[1:11:46] foundation of the world
[1:11:48] so it's not as though somebody can come
[1:11:51] and do a kind deed and have their name
[1:11:52] added no their name has to already be
[1:11:55] there
[1:11:57] which means God had in his mind
[1:11:59] salvation for many more than just his
[1:12:02] bride
[1:12:04] God had in his mind amen he he already
[1:12:09] knew the plan from beginning to end he
[1:12:11] already could foresee what he was going
[1:12:13] to do because he already had a lamb
[1:12:15] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:12:16] he knew there would be a fall he knew
[1:12:18] the consequence of the Fall he knew
[1:12:20] there would need to be a lamb he knew
[1:12:22] there would need to be individuals amen
[1:12:24] that he would secure so he wrote amen
[1:12:27] the section of eternal life in the
[1:12:28] Lamb's Book of Life and secured it but
[1:12:30] he also put other names in there because
[1:12:33] these are so few he needs support they
[1:12:36] need help they need other people
[1:12:39] and God provided it before the
[1:12:41] foundation of the world
[1:12:44] they don't even know what they're doing
[1:12:48] but God knows
[1:12:51] God knows
[1:12:53] God knows who would stand up for you at
[1:12:55] work
[1:12:57] God knows who would help you in a time
[1:12:59] of need God has provided everything for
[1:13:02] his word
[1:13:04] and everybody that has the privilege of
[1:13:07] playing a positive part in the word
[1:13:09] moving forward gets a benefit
[1:13:13] for that
[1:13:14] and I'm so thankful to serve a God Like
[1:13:17] That
[1:13:19] a righteous God who's righteous in
[1:13:21] everything that he does
[1:13:25] brother remember said you are the temple
[1:13:27] that God wants to dwell in and express
[1:13:29] himself through it that all the nations
[1:13:31] might know him you are a living images
[1:13:33] of God that God wants to work through
[1:13:38] you are literally the word made flesh
[1:13:42] let's look at Revelation chapter six I
[1:13:44] want to look at now salvation of the
[1:13:47] Jews
[1:13:49] Revelation chapter 6.
[1:13:53] verse 9.
[1:14:01] Revelation 6 and 9 this is the fifth
[1:14:03] seal and when he had opened the fifth
[1:14:05] seal I saw under the altar The Souls of
[1:14:07] them that were slain for the word of God
[1:14:10] for the testimony which they held
[1:14:12] they cried with a loud voice saying how
[1:14:14] long O Lord holy and true Dost thou not
[1:14:16] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[1:14:18] dwell on the Earth
[1:14:19] white robes were given unto every one of
[1:14:22] them and it was said unto them that they
[1:14:23] should rest yet for a little season
[1:14:25] until their fellow servants also and
[1:14:28] their Brethren that should be killed as
[1:14:29] they were should be fulfilled
[1:14:33] we know that this physio is whether I'm
[1:14:36] taught in the fifth seal that these are
[1:14:37] Jews here we find in the fifth seal
[1:14:40] because they they were slain for the
[1:14:43] word of God and for the testimony which
[1:14:44] they held not the testimony of Jesus
[1:14:46] Christ these aren't Saints these aren't
[1:14:48] church members this is the these are
[1:14:50] Jews and they're also crying out for
[1:14:52] revenge for Christians don't cry out for
[1:14:54] Revenge they forgive so he shows us that
[1:14:56] these are Jews and these are the Jews
[1:14:58] from the time of Christ all the way
[1:15:00] through till the rapture
[1:15:02] all the way through to the calling of
[1:15:04] the 144 000 and he's and he shows that
[1:15:07] this is this group and they're given
[1:15:08] white robes because they're recipients
[1:15:10] of Grace and he begins to talk about
[1:15:12] this in the sardesian church age it is
[1:15:15] the second resurrection that the souls
[1:15:17] under the altar are set forth in the
[1:15:18] fissile are given white robes and of
[1:15:21] course eternal life or there could be no
[1:15:23] point of white robes and when he had
[1:15:25] opened the fifth seal as I saw under the
[1:15:27] altar The Souls of them that were slain
[1:15:28] for the word of God and for the
[1:15:30] testimony which they held and they cried
[1:15:32] with a loud voice how long O Lord holy
[1:15:34] and true Dost thou not judge and avenge
[1:15:36] our blood on them that dwell on the
[1:15:39] earth now note particularly that none of
[1:15:41] these under the altar were killed for
[1:15:42] the testimony to Jesus they were not
[1:15:44] like Antipas who was slain for holding
[1:15:46] fast his name they are not born again
[1:15:48] ones with eternal life as their
[1:15:50] possession they come up in the
[1:15:52] resurrection and receive life because of
[1:15:55] their stand on the word
[1:15:57] why are they giving life because of the
[1:16:01] word what's judgment based on because
[1:16:03] judgment's based on the word because
[1:16:05] they were slain for the word of God and
[1:16:08] for the testimony which they held look
[1:16:10] what he says and notice
[1:16:11] now these are crying out for vengeance
[1:16:13] they cannot be bride material the bride
[1:16:16] turns the cheek in Christ forgive them
[1:16:17] Father
[1:16:18] these are Jews they have to be because
[1:16:20] they are in the fifth seal and it is a
[1:16:22] force field that the Gentile bride has
[1:16:24] gone in the Rapture so these are these
[1:16:27] Jews aren't born of the spirit they
[1:16:29] don't even believe that Jesus is the
[1:16:30] Messiah but as they were blinded by God
[1:16:33] for the Gentile sake God gave them
[1:16:36] eternal life on the grounds that they
[1:16:38] could not come to him
[1:16:40] yet they were truly faithful to all the
[1:16:43] word they knew
[1:16:45] and died for it as multitudes died under
[1:16:49] Hitler's Stalin Etc and yet die
[1:16:52] these Jews amen who never recognized
[1:16:55] Jesus Christ as the Messiah for two
[1:16:58] thousand years nearly amen they've been
[1:17:00] going down in death they've been holding
[1:17:02] to an Old Testament law they've been
[1:17:04] holding to the word but if they were
[1:17:05] faithful to hold to that because God
[1:17:08] blinded their eyes and would not allow
[1:17:10] them to see the truth because he blinded
[1:17:13] them he's righteous amen and he's not
[1:17:16] going to judge them for the part he
[1:17:17] blinded them for what he's judging them
[1:17:19] for is how they held to the portion of
[1:17:21] the word that was still available to
[1:17:23] them
[1:17:24] he did he God is righteous he doesn't
[1:17:27] blind somebody and then judge you for
[1:17:28] being blind he blinded them he blinded
[1:17:31] them so he could come and get you and I
[1:17:32] amen but he still judges them based off
[1:17:35] the word that part of the word that's
[1:17:37] still available for them what they do
[1:17:39] with that word determines their Eternal
[1:17:41] destination
[1:17:42] because he judges based off the word
[1:17:47] we see the theme God is righteous in all
[1:17:50] things and he judges based off his word
[1:17:54] let's look at the foolish virgin
[1:17:57] same same section of the church age book
[1:17:59] in the sardisian church age so it is the
[1:18:01] second Resurrection wherein the five
[1:18:03] foolish virgin comes up notice they were
[1:18:05] virgin they did not have the Holy Spirit
[1:18:07] so they missed being in the bride while
[1:18:09] the five wives who had oil became part
[1:18:11] of that bride
[1:18:12] but these people being separated
[1:18:14] god-loving people and trying to abide in
[1:18:17] the word according to what they knew of
[1:18:19] it
[1:18:20] and being a help in the work of the Lord
[1:18:22] will come up at the end of time
[1:18:25] he's talking about the foolish virgin
[1:18:27] amen the foolish virgin do not have a
[1:18:30] seed to believe with
[1:18:32] they don't have the seed that you have
[1:18:34] to believe the message and they have no
[1:18:36] Spirit of Revelation given to them they
[1:18:38] they can't come to the message
[1:18:41] you couldn't come unless God drawed you
[1:18:44] you couldn't come unless there was an
[1:18:45] eternal sea Gene of God down on the
[1:18:47] inside a receptor a representation of
[1:18:50] predestination that would say that's the
[1:18:51] truth you couldn't come to the message
[1:18:53] without that amen you had no ability to
[1:18:55] bring yourself to truth and believe the
[1:18:57] truth God already placed it in you and
[1:18:59] then God Drew you to it and he revealed
[1:19:01] it to you by his Spirit you didn't do it
[1:19:03] he did it
[1:19:05] these people they can't do it they
[1:19:08] cannot come to the revelation of the
[1:19:10] word because they don't have
[1:19:12] representation of predestination on the
[1:19:14] inside they don't have the word to
[1:19:16] receive the word with amen but what they
[1:19:19] have they give fully to the word that's
[1:19:21] open to them and they try their best to
[1:19:24] live the word that's available to them
[1:19:27] and with whatever little capacity that
[1:19:30] they have
[1:19:31] they give it to the word that's
[1:19:33] available you know the Bible has a
[1:19:35] surface level
[1:19:36] there's a surface level to the Bible not
[1:19:38] reading between the lines not seeing the
[1:19:40] types and shadows but just the surface
[1:19:42] level that you can catch intellectually
[1:19:44] amen if this foolish virgin lives clean
[1:19:46] doesn't throw away the word but tries to
[1:19:49] live the portion that's given to them
[1:19:50] and stays true and is is a help in the
[1:19:53] work of the Lord guess what happens at
[1:19:55] the white Throne judgment they're judged
[1:19:58] based off the portion of the word that
[1:19:59] was available to them
[1:20:01] they're judged by the word that they had
[1:20:06] praise be to God trying to abide in the
[1:20:08] word according to what they knew of it
[1:20:09] and being a help in the work of the Lord
[1:20:11] will come up at the end of time they
[1:20:14] will miss the Millennium which you can
[1:20:15] begin to see by these truth is much more
[1:20:17] important and wonderful than we have
[1:20:19] ever thought or believed
[1:20:21] all these people had their names in The
[1:20:23] Book of Life and their names remained
[1:20:26] but whose names did not remain those of
[1:20:29] the world system churches who fought the
[1:20:31] bride will be those whose names are
[1:20:34] removed
[1:20:35] that is who will lose out they will be
[1:20:38] cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:20:41] why because they fought Christ the word
[1:20:45] because they rejected Christ the word
[1:20:47] and they pushed out Christ the word and
[1:20:50] they fought Christ the word and they
[1:20:52] condemned Christ the word where was he
[1:20:54] he was in his church
[1:20:56] and because they resisted that their
[1:20:59] names are removed blotted out of the
[1:21:02] book of life and they go into damnation
[1:21:04] but anybody who respects God God
[1:21:07] respects them
[1:21:10] I love this message
[1:21:13] let's look at let's look a couple more
[1:21:15] scriptures let's look at Psalms 96. I
[1:21:17] want to look at one more thing out of
[1:21:18] the word that just thrilled my heart
[1:21:22] Psalms 96.
[1:21:27] and verse 10.
[1:21:31] Psalms 96 and 10.
[1:21:35] say among the Heathen that the Lord
[1:21:38] reigneth the world also shall be
[1:21:40] established that it shall not be moved
[1:21:42] he shall judge the people righteously
[1:21:46] God will judge righteously
[1:21:50] he will not blind and then judge you for
[1:21:52] being blind he'll blind you but he'll
[1:21:55] judge you based off the word that was
[1:21:57] still available
[1:21:59] he will allow you to come in contact
[1:22:01] with his word and in whatever way you
[1:22:03] come in contact with that word with
[1:22:05] whatever manifestation whatever degree
[1:22:07] he will judge you based off that
[1:22:10] and if you loved him and honored him and
[1:22:14] respected him then he can honor and
[1:22:17] respect you
[1:22:21] the reason I love this so much is
[1:22:23] because when we get to the new heavens
[1:22:25] and new earth there is no sin
[1:22:27] there is no unrighteousness there is
[1:22:29] nothing but the word
[1:22:31] when we get the new heavens and the
[1:22:32] Earth it's the word it's only the word
[1:22:35] there's no perversion there's no sin
[1:22:37] it's the word made manifest and if you
[1:22:39] didn't love the word when you came in
[1:22:41] contact with it how are you going to
[1:22:43] love the word over there because God is
[1:22:45] righteous in all ways if you hated the
[1:22:47] word here you will never want to live
[1:22:49] there
[1:22:50] if you could not stand the word if you
[1:22:53] could not take the word if it if it
[1:22:55] irritated you if you didn't agree with
[1:22:57] it you'd never be a candidate to live in
[1:22:59] the new heaven the new Earth you'd be a
[1:23:01] miserable person there because if it's
[1:23:03] those who love God and love his word
[1:23:05] amen they might not even know what it is
[1:23:07] they're loving but they love something
[1:23:09] in you a life in you that they can love
[1:23:11] and respect they don't know that that's
[1:23:13] the word they just know there's
[1:23:14] something different about you and if
[1:23:17] they love that little bit that you're
[1:23:18] manifesting wait till they get over to
[1:23:20] new heavens and new earth and that
[1:23:22] little bit they were attracted to blows
[1:23:24] up and is everywhere and everything and
[1:23:26] all-encompassing they'll be in heaven
[1:23:28] but the person who couldn't take your
[1:23:30] righteousness couldn't stand the fact
[1:23:31] that you lived clean hated amen the fact
[1:23:34] that you bowed your head and prayed
[1:23:35] they'll never want to be there anyways
[1:23:39] because God judges righteously god is
[1:23:41] perfect he gives everyone an opportunity
[1:23:44] and they express their own judgment amen
[1:23:46] man condemns himself man judges himself
[1:23:50] God allows them amen to have contact in
[1:23:54] some way with a portion of him because
[1:23:56] remember his thoughts are are the word
[1:23:58] his thoughts expressed which is God
[1:24:00] expressing himself and if you can't
[1:24:02] respect that expression and if you don't
[1:24:04] love it there's no point in you going on
[1:24:06] Beyond Time
[1:24:09] now let's look at Romans chapter 2.
[1:24:18] when you see the word
[1:24:20] when the message opens the word you see
[1:24:23] that God is absolutely perfect
[1:24:26] there is no
[1:24:28] there is no unrighteousness whatsoever
[1:24:31] in God
[1:24:32] there is no unfairness there's no that
[1:24:35] God is absolutely completely just
[1:24:38] righteous and perfect in every way
[1:24:42] and I've never seen him so beautiful as
[1:24:44] I've seen him through this word
[1:24:46] when the seals come off the word you see
[1:24:48] how beautiful that he really is
[1:24:51] let's look at chapter 2 Romans chapter 2
[1:24:53] verse 11.
[1:24:56] for there is no respect of persons with
[1:24:58] God
[1:25:00] for as many as have sinned without the
[1:25:02] law shall also perish without the law
[1:25:05] though these who did not know the word
[1:25:08] coming up to this point
[1:25:10] those who did not know the word
[1:25:12] they'll perish without the word
[1:25:14] God will judge them based off what they
[1:25:16] had
[1:25:18] so for as many as Sin without the law
[1:25:20] shall also perish without the law and as
[1:25:22] many as have sinned in the law shall be
[1:25:24] judged by the law for not the hearers of
[1:25:27] the Lord just before God but the doers
[1:25:29] of the law shall be justified
[1:25:31] for when the Gentiles remember the
[1:25:33] Gentiles were heathens
[1:25:35] for when the Gentiles which have not the
[1:25:37] law do by Nature the things contained in
[1:25:40] the law these having not the law are a
[1:25:43] law unto themselves
[1:25:46] which show the work of the law written
[1:25:48] in their hearts their conscience also
[1:25:51] bearing witness and their thoughts the
[1:25:53] meanwhile accusing or else excusing one
[1:25:56] another
[1:25:58] in the day when God shall judge the
[1:26:00] secrets of men by Jesus Christ according
[1:26:03] to my gospel
[1:26:05] when God comes to the white Throne
[1:26:08] judgment and everybody that has ever
[1:26:10] lived upon the Earth comes and stands
[1:26:12] for him
[1:26:13] God has a way of judging everyone
[1:26:17] whether they heard the word spoken read
[1:26:20] out of a book where they come in contact
[1:26:23] with a sea Gene of God or not God has a
[1:26:26] way of judging everybody according to
[1:26:28] his word and he said these Gentiles who
[1:26:31] have not the law
[1:26:32] let's read it carefully
[1:26:35] verse 14 for when the Gentiles which
[1:26:37] have not the law
[1:26:39] which to them is the word this is the
[1:26:40] Old Testament the word do by Nature the
[1:26:43] things contained in law
[1:26:45] these having not the law are a law unto
[1:26:48] themselves
[1:26:50] so when those by the law of Nature and
[1:26:53] conscience They Know listen you can find
[1:26:57] pygmy Indians in the middle of Africa
[1:26:59] who know it's wrong to murder
[1:27:02] they didn't need the law to know it was
[1:27:04] wrong to murder they know it's wrong to
[1:27:06] steal and they know it's wrong to take
[1:27:08] another man's wife
[1:27:10] they have laws amongst themselves
[1:27:12] forbidding these kind of unrighteous
[1:27:14] what is it it's the law of conscience
[1:27:16] the law of nature man has a conscience
[1:27:18] he has a nature in him that knows that
[1:27:20] there are certain things that are not
[1:27:22] right how is it so common across so many
[1:27:25] different Aboriginal tribes that they
[1:27:27] have the same basic standard of it's
[1:27:29] wrong to murder it's wrong to steal it's
[1:27:31] wrong to take amen somebody else's wife
[1:27:33] where did they come up with this it's
[1:27:35] the law of nature that is in the heart
[1:27:37] of man and when they by Nature do that
[1:27:40] which is contained in God's law they
[1:27:42] become a law unto themselves and now
[1:27:44] their own heart and mind either accuses
[1:27:48] or excuses one another God now has a
[1:27:51] basis to judge even these people
[1:27:55] because because listen to me carefully
[1:27:58] now
[1:27:59] these having not the law are a law unto
[1:28:03] themselves
[1:28:05] which show the work of the law written
[1:28:07] in their hearts their conscience also
[1:28:10] bearing witness in their thoughts the
[1:28:12] meanwhile accusing or else excusing one
[1:28:15] another in the day when God shall judge
[1:28:18] the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[1:28:20] according to my gospel
[1:28:24] man
[1:28:26] has a conscience and a law the things
[1:28:28] that are contained in the law
[1:28:30] are also in the natural conscience of
[1:28:32] man
[1:28:34] and when man has the ability to live
[1:28:36] that conscience he accuses or excuses
[1:28:40] his fellow man
[1:28:42] who won't abide by that
[1:28:44] I want to look at something brother
[1:28:45] Branham said
[1:28:48] because I find it super interesting
[1:28:50] in the Ephesian Church age
[1:28:52] he says now I know and answering one
[1:28:54] question another one is apt to come up
[1:28:56] if people ask me if he fell that way by
[1:28:59] adultering what did Adam do for God lays
[1:29:01] the blame on Adam we know Adam didn't
[1:29:03] commit adultery Eve committed adultery
[1:29:05] not Adam
[1:29:07] that is simple the word of God is
[1:29:10] forever settled in heaven
[1:29:13] before one Speck of Stardust was made
[1:29:15] the word God's law was there exactly as
[1:29:19] it is written in our Bible
[1:29:22] now the word teaches us that if a woman
[1:29:24] leaves her husband and goes with another
[1:29:25] man she's an adulteress and is no longer
[1:29:27] married and the husband is not to take
[1:29:30] her back the word was true and Eden as
[1:29:32] it was true when Moses wrote it in the
[1:29:34] law the word can't change Adam took her
[1:29:37] back he knew exactly what he was doing
[1:29:39] but he did it anyway she was a part of
[1:29:41] him and he was willing to take a
[1:29:43] responsibility upon himself he could not
[1:29:45] let her go so Eve conceived by him he
[1:29:48] knew she would he knew exactly what
[1:29:51] would happen to the human race and he
[1:29:52] sold out the human race and the sin that
[1:29:54] he might have Eve for he loved her
[1:29:57] this is so astounding before anything
[1:30:00] was written on paper God's law was
[1:30:02] established in heaven just as it's
[1:30:04] written in our Bible amen and God held
[1:30:07] Adam accountable for that word
[1:30:10] Adam didn't have a Bible but Adam knew
[1:30:12] what he was doing was wrong because the
[1:30:13] law of God is set in heaven it's fixed
[1:30:16] but we have in our Bible is a reflection
[1:30:18] of a fixed law fixed word that was
[1:30:20] already in heaven before it came to
[1:30:22] Earth and before it came on paper amen
[1:30:24] and Adam amen when he did what was
[1:30:27] contrary to the law of God Amen he was
[1:30:30] rejected by God and we see this through
[1:30:32] the Old Testament because when when when
[1:30:34] uh when Abraham goes down with Sarah
[1:30:38] unto pharaoh and he lies and says this
[1:30:40] is my sister and Pharaoh finds out and
[1:30:43] and same thing happens with Isaac amen
[1:30:45] and same thing happens with abimelech
[1:30:46] they come and they then when they find
[1:30:48] out that this isn't your sister this is
[1:30:50] your wife they're scared to death
[1:30:52] because they almost sinned and did
[1:30:54] something wrong and took another man's
[1:30:56] wife who told them it was a sin there
[1:30:59] was no law written there was no Bible on
[1:31:01] Earth
[1:31:03] the Bible didn't start being written
[1:31:05] until we have a book of job that's old
[1:31:07] we don't know when it was wrote but
[1:31:09] Moses started putting together the law
[1:31:10] amen that's when the Bible came into
[1:31:13] position on the earth and that's when
[1:31:14] they were told that don't do this and
[1:31:16] don't do that but how did abimelech know
[1:31:18] how did Pharaoh know how did they all
[1:31:21] know because there was a law in the
[1:31:23] conscience of man they knew that this
[1:31:25] was wrong because that law was
[1:31:26] established in heaven
[1:31:29] and when God comes to abimelech who's
[1:31:31] going to take Sarah he says you know if
[1:31:34] you take her that's another man's wife
[1:31:35] if you take her you'll be a dead man he
[1:31:37] says Lord you know the Integrity of my
[1:31:39] heart
[1:31:42] didn't he say this is my sister and he
[1:31:45] says yea I know the Integrity of their
[1:31:46] heart that's why I warned you here you
[1:31:49] have a man who is not see Gene of God he
[1:31:52] is not what Abraham is but God seeing
[1:31:55] that he's righteous trying to fulfill
[1:31:57] the law of conscience God will come to
[1:31:59] him in a dream speak to him and warn him
[1:32:01] against sinning against the law of
[1:32:03] conscience
[1:32:06] how wonderful is our God how merciful is
[1:32:09] our God he saw that abimelech was not
[1:32:12] intending to do evil abimelech was
[1:32:14] following the law of conscience which
[1:32:16] matched the law in heaven and God knew
[1:32:18] that he was righteous and it was
[1:32:20] Abraham's fault not a beam Alex so he
[1:32:23] comes to a beam elect a non-seed
[1:32:25] non-abraham non-royal seed and warns him
[1:32:28] so that he won't
[1:32:30] fall into sin
[1:32:35] what Bible was abimelech reading
[1:32:39] he had the law of conscience and by
[1:32:42] Nature he was doing that which was
[1:32:43] written in the law and God had mercy on
[1:32:46] him
[1:32:47] he was already under a curse because God
[1:32:49] had shut fast the wounds
[1:32:52] of the of the servants and of his wife
[1:32:55] but God said have Abraham pray for you
[1:32:59] unless he prayed for your dead you can
[1:33:02] see what a difference there is between
[1:33:03] Abraham and abimelech
[1:33:06] there's a huge difference between
[1:33:07] Abraham and abimelech but because
[1:33:09] abimelech was holding true to that
[1:33:12] portion of the word that he had God
[1:33:14] honored abimelech and God protected
[1:33:18] abimelech
[1:33:20] God never even condemned Abraham and
[1:33:22] Abraham was one Abraham was so much
[1:33:24] further away he was so much in a
[1:33:27] different position with God than him
[1:33:28] like but God still honored a beamlet
[1:33:30] because abimelech was honoring God
[1:33:34] I love this Bible
[1:33:36] I love the God of this Bible and tell me
[1:33:40] where anywhere else on the earth that
[1:33:42] there is a there is a Ministry a message
[1:33:44] a teaching that will teach the god of
[1:33:46] the Bible the way he's actually written
[1:33:48] in the Bible with all the mercy and all
[1:33:51] the grace and all the opportunities he
[1:33:53] gives the different ones in different
[1:33:54] categories I'm telling you this Prophet
[1:33:57] was a prophet of God he knew more than
[1:33:59] the letter he could go to the heart of
[1:34:01] God bring the nature of God out and show
[1:34:03] it through this Bible
[1:34:06] and when he gets to the white Throne
[1:34:08] judgment I mean everybody else will say
[1:34:10] either you confess Jesus Christ as your
[1:34:12] savior you're in or you're out but this
[1:34:14] one comes and said these may not have
[1:34:16] confessed Jesus Christ their savior
[1:34:18] they're they're brought in solely on the
[1:34:20] fact that they honored the word when the
[1:34:22] word was presented to them
[1:34:23] where was it presented it was presented
[1:34:26] in the brethren in a body of Flesh
[1:34:27] manifesting the word and when they
[1:34:29] honored that God honored them
[1:34:33] because God judges by his word
[1:34:37] he judges the Jews by the word there was
[1:34:39] a portion he kept them from
[1:34:42] so he judged him on the portion that was
[1:34:44] open
[1:34:46] the foolish virgin could not receive
[1:34:48] revelation
[1:34:50] so what was commonly open and understood
[1:34:53] on a surface level when they would honor
[1:34:55] that and live true to that God would
[1:34:57] honor them
[1:34:58] as long as they didn't reject the truth
[1:35:01] as long as they didn't call it heresy as
[1:35:03] long as they didn't call it doctrine of
[1:35:04] devils as long as they as long as they
[1:35:06] just stayed in the portion that was open
[1:35:08] and stayed true to it God would honor
[1:35:10] them
[1:35:16] this word is wonderful
[1:35:19] our God is righteous
[1:35:22] this word is perfect
[1:35:24] and you will never see it this perfect
[1:35:26] anywhere outside the message of the hour
[1:35:30] you'll never see this kind of Mercy the
[1:35:32] sign of Grace this kind of God
[1:35:34] interacting
[1:35:35] with the Heathen King
[1:35:38] but God
[1:35:40] is perfect his word is perfect and he's
[1:35:43] given us a perfect interpretation his
[1:35:45] word with Divine vindication
[1:35:48] I'm so glad that I don't have to walk
[1:35:51] around and think of my family and think
[1:35:54] of people that I work with and people I
[1:35:55] associate with I'm so glad I don't have
[1:35:57] to walk around thinking they are all
[1:35:59] condemned to hell and they're all doomed
[1:36:01] because they don't have a seat of
[1:36:03] predestination they cannot receive what
[1:36:06] I'm able to receive I'm so glad I don't
[1:36:08] have to walk around and say this is the
[1:36:10] only time that I'll ever share with them
[1:36:11] but I can say if they can honor whatever
[1:36:14] capacity God allows them to come in
[1:36:16] contact with the word if they can honor
[1:36:17] and respect that amen our fellowship
[1:36:19] doesn't end here it can continue beyond
[1:36:22] time
[1:36:23] I love serving a god like that and I
[1:36:26] love walking through this Earth knowing
[1:36:28] that God knows who is who and I don't
[1:36:30] have to decide who is who and wherever
[1:36:32] somebody fits I'm going to let them fit
[1:36:35] wherever they fit into the economy of
[1:36:37] God sure we we want everybody to receive
[1:36:40] the message but not everybody can
[1:36:42] receive the message only those who are
[1:36:44] predestinated to receive it can receive
[1:36:46] it
[1:36:48] I'm so glad that I don't have to make
[1:36:50] somebody something they are what they
[1:36:52] are by the grace of God oh I'm so
[1:36:55] thankful that I don't have to determine
[1:36:57] amen God is already determined
[1:37:00] they're determining Now by how they
[1:37:02] react to the word of God
[1:37:05] and I thank God that he's that kind of
[1:37:08] God
[1:37:09] I'm so thankful that my father when when
[1:37:13] this may sound childish but when I see
[1:37:15] the message bring this truth to light
[1:37:17] I'm proud of my father
[1:37:20] I serve a God who is righteous I serve a
[1:37:24] God who is just I serve a God who is
[1:37:26] merciful I serve a God who is righteous
[1:37:29] in judgment he's not willy-nilly he
[1:37:30] doesn't let anything go he doesn't just
[1:37:32] say well I will pass on that no he's got
[1:37:34] a method by which he judges and he stays
[1:37:36] true to that method amen any judges by
[1:37:39] the word but he's perfectly righteous
[1:37:40] and merciful in his judgment
[1:37:44] now we realize
[1:37:46] that each individual one of us if you
[1:37:50] are a child of God you were a thought of
[1:37:52] God that's expressed in this day to
[1:37:54] manifest the word of God in your day and
[1:37:57] it doesn't matter what part you play it
[1:38:00] doesn't want what measure you have it
[1:38:02] doesn't matter your gender or your age
[1:38:04] or your locality or the gift that's in
[1:38:06] your life the very fact that you exist
[1:38:09] on this Earth gives somebody an
[1:38:12] opportunity to come in contact with the
[1:38:13] Living Word
[1:38:16] if you're a child in that condition
[1:38:18] you've been born again by the spirit of
[1:38:20] God if you're a teenager if you're in
[1:38:22] college if you're working if you're what
[1:38:24] if whatever you are in whatever capacity
[1:38:26] God has placed you every individual
[1:38:29] attribute of God that is an expressed
[1:38:31] word of God in this day there is a power
[1:38:34] in the fact that you're alive and
[1:38:36] there's an opportunity in the fact that
[1:38:38] you're here that can create an
[1:38:40] opportunity for somebody else
[1:38:43] so all of those interactions
[1:38:46] are not wasted
[1:38:48] our life
[1:38:50] our life means something
[1:38:54] the fact that God still chooses to be on
[1:38:57] display in this generation means
[1:38:59] something
[1:39:01] the fact that he's living in flesh and
[1:39:04] coming in contact with multitudes of
[1:39:06] individuals around the world mean
[1:39:08] something
[1:39:10] don't don't ever allow the enemy to
[1:39:13] trivialize our lives the very fact that
[1:39:16] God is walking in your flesh means
[1:39:18] something
[1:39:19] it means something that those people
[1:39:21] you're around those people you contact
[1:39:23] it may mean something for somebody
[1:39:25] you'll contact in the future but
[1:39:27] whatever however God works it out your
[1:39:30] everyday life matters and every uh
[1:39:33] everybody you come in contact with is
[1:39:36] presented with an opportunity
[1:39:38] and now
[1:39:40] God has Mercy on the Earth
[1:39:43] because his bride is here
[1:39:46] God has Mercy on the Earth
[1:39:49] because he's Tabernacle deity
[1:39:51] tabernacled and flesh
[1:39:53] because we are templing Christ
[1:39:56] Mercy is still here
[1:39:59] and I thank God for that
[1:40:02] let's read one more scripture as we
[1:40:04] close Psalms chapter 9.
[1:40:09] musicians if you want to make your way
[1:40:10] on up
[1:40:13] Psalms chapter 9.
[1:40:25] Psalms 9 and 7.
[1:40:30] but the Lord shall endure forever
[1:40:33] he hath prepared his throne for judgment
[1:40:35] and he shall judge the world in
[1:40:37] righteousness he shall Minister judgment
[1:40:40] to the people in uprightness
[1:40:43] how many believe that
[1:40:46] to be every bit the truth how many see
[1:40:48] that that is every bit the truth
[1:40:51] god is perfect
[1:40:54] and he is beautiful
[1:40:56] and this message is the greatest
[1:40:58] Revelation that's ever struck this Earth
[1:41:01] to open up the Bible but not open up
[1:41:04] like doctrines but to open up the very
[1:41:07] person of the word
[1:41:09] and show us the very character and
[1:41:11] nature of a loving God
[1:41:13] I thank God for that let's all stand
[1:41:18] and like I said that was not new that's
[1:41:21] common to many of us
[1:41:22] but it sure did me a world of good
[1:41:26] I love
[1:41:27] this message let's bow our heads and
[1:41:29] pray
[1:41:30] Lord Jesus we thank you for your
[1:41:32] goodness and your mercy Lord
[1:41:35] God it's overwhelming when we see that
[1:41:38] your thinking is so far superior to our
[1:41:41] thinking
[1:41:43] what denomination is denominations have
[1:41:45] come up with Lord is
[1:41:47] so narrow
[1:41:49] that it's not your nature
[1:41:51] are so broad that you can no longer be
[1:41:54] just and judged that way
[1:41:57] they've Fallen to the right and they've
[1:41:58] Fallen to the left
[1:42:00] either it's so narrow you can have no
[1:42:02] mercy or it's so broad you can no longer
[1:42:05] be just
[1:42:07] but God by the revelation of the word
[1:42:09] you've taken the seals off of your book
[1:42:10] and now we understand your mystery
[1:42:13] and you've brought us back to the
[1:42:15] reality of how you're merciful and just
[1:42:20] how you're good in every way and how you
[1:42:22] judge the world and uprightness and
[1:42:25] you're making no mistakes and everybody
[1:42:28] has had a fair chance
[1:42:30] every human being that has come on this
[1:42:32] Earth has had a fair chance Lord
[1:42:35] and God you're not going to judge for
[1:42:37] that which was withheld
[1:42:39] you're not going to judge for that which
[1:42:40] was not revealed
[1:42:42] but you're going to judge according to
[1:42:44] the word that each individual has come
[1:42:47] in contact with
[1:42:48] that portion of yourself that you
[1:42:50] allowed
[1:42:51] to be present
[1:42:53] God I pray
[1:42:55] that you would save the Lost
[1:42:58] I pray God that you would create
