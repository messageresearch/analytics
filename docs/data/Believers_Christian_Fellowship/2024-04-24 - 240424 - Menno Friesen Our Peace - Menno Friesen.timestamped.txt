[13:53] the Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be
[13:54] here tonight and uh I U I'm GL glad to
[13:59] be back here again it seems like uh uh
[14:02] we're getting to be that way that uh
[14:04] we're going to be more than visitors
[14:05] after a while we going have to pull a
[14:07] little heavier to do more work but we're
[14:10] very glad to see you all you know we we
[14:12] wanted to go to I I we bumped in brother
[14:15] Chad and his wife and um kind of hoping
[14:18] I wouldn't
[14:20] um but you know the Lord has ways I past
[14:24] understanding but uh coming out of a
[14:26] restaurant we were just going in and and
[14:28] uh so then he called me later and I was
[14:31] kind of I'd been with brother Wayne he
[14:33] called me and of course and you know how
[14:35] it is uh he said uh make it time make it
[14:38] time and then I'll we'll work around it
[14:40] because you know everybody's busy I know
[14:42] that too I'm retired now of uh pastoring
[14:45] so I've got a little more time to to say
[14:48] a while so but uh it I wanted to see of
[14:52] course you know it's always the Lima has
[14:54] a a special attraction and and um we
[14:58] don't we don't sometimes know but just
[15:00] as I kind of get reacquainted again
[15:02] tonight I've always marveled how how God
[15:05] does things uh when you uh realize that
[15:08] you had so little in
[15:10] it uh the steps of the righteous as we
[15:14] would uh maybe get to the scripture
[15:16] later but how that he orders them and
[15:19] sometimes you wonder why did I do it
[15:21] this way or why why was I there why
[15:23] wasn't I there why didn't I do that this
[15:25] way when I could have done it that way
[15:28] but then you realize that there's
[15:29] something that works out in our life
[15:32] that we uh we come here without we're
[15:35] born without character and the molding
[15:37] starts about the time we start breathing
[15:40] and uh it doesn't stop till we stop
[15:42] breathing and the molding of the shaping
[15:45] of the of the great statue that he has
[15:48] uh you know he knows exactly what he's
[15:51] looking for and at and uh the turning
[15:54] out I was U uh just uh before I came a
[15:59] month or so before I was I was going
[16:01] through some a little message several
[16:04] messages there somebody had asked a
[16:05] question you know how we do around the
[16:07] message sometimes we when we preachers
[16:09] sit around somebody said say what did
[16:11] Brother Bram mean over here when he said
[16:12] that and and where did he say this and
[16:14] so I was looking for something and and
[16:16] it was during the meetings that brother
[16:18] Ram was preaching in in Saskatoon in
[16:21] 1957 and um as most of this is this is
[16:26] the that was the first time I was in his
[16:27] meetings in 1950 7 and I was just 15
[16:30] years old at the time and uh not really
[16:34] I'd give my heart to the Lord but you
[16:36] know what 15 the mind wanders a whole
[16:38] lot this you 15y old know what I'm
[16:41] talking about it's starting to take on
[16:43] the masculine or the feminist part and
[16:45] you begin to realize that say I'm not
[16:46] that kid anymore yet I feel I want to be
[16:49] but I don't know yet I want to be older
[16:51] and I was in that state when brother Ram
[16:53] was there in
[16:55] Saskatoon and I was only in two services
[16:57] but as I was going through these
[16:59] messages I heard brother Braham say
[17:01] something that kind of caught me and he
[17:03] said you know he said uh i' I'm
[17:06] following I'm following the leadership
[17:08] of the Holy Spirit he said I I I feel
[17:11] these are the meetings here that is
[17:13] going to do something and it begin to
[17:15] refer to the meetings in Regina before
[17:17] uh Saskatoon and he said I'm wanting to
[17:20] change my my Ministry in the prayer line
[17:25] and he said I had a vision here back in
[17:27] January the 14th
[17:29] in Lima
[17:31] Ohio so that maybe doesn't that make you
[17:34] feel good that he said that made me feel
[17:36] good I said Li Ohio you did he said yes
[17:39] he said I had but I can't tell the
[17:41] vision right now said cuz I'm still
[17:42] waiting for
[17:43] something and he didn't say what it was
[17:46] then the night after he referred to it
[17:48] again and uh hear you himm the message
[17:53] and the last message is love and he
[17:55] preached and he talked about the vision
[17:56] of Lima then he said another another
[17:58] thing I think the next night before he
[17:59] comes to the prayer and the third night
[18:02] he said uh I was in my room there today
[18:04] he said I wondered is I'm he said
[18:06] Remember the prayer meeting said last
[18:08] night how much better it was than the
[18:09] nights before and how I went through
[18:11] prayed for so many people and I didn't
[18:12] lose my strength and I was able to pray
[18:14] for them with those Visions coming now
[18:18] and he said uh I was waiting and I
[18:20] looked and I wondered whether this was
[18:24] what what that Vision had been and I
[18:26] went to my window and looked out of the
[18:27] window of the hotel the Bez Hotel I saw
[18:30] the river and there's a falls to the
[18:32] left and the Holy Spirit said that's the
[18:35] vision you had he didn't say while in
[18:37] Lima but said that's the vision that you
[18:39] had which you said previously I'm
[18:41] talking about Lima I said and here it is
[18:43] coming to pass here in
[18:46] Saskatoon gu oh my that maybe that's why
[18:48] I always feel going to go to Lima I
[18:50] don't know how we the first time I ever
[18:51] came here was in 75 year 75 with brother
[18:54] bisco the first time we ever came here
[18:57] didn't know a soul in the area
[18:59] and uh that was that's a few years ago
[19:02] now so many of you wasn't born and
[19:07] uh God rich in Mercy I'm thinking it's
[19:10] been my guide in my lifeline from the
[19:13] time uh when when God of course later on
[19:16] I got to hear Brother Braham in in the
[19:18] marriage divorce series and um I by that
[19:21] time was married and had a a family a
[19:24] wife and family Irene if you don't know
[19:26] my wife's name her name is Irene she
[19:28] she's sitting all alone there
[19:33] today but we've we've been blessed we've
[19:36] got who you know when we get to talk
[19:39] about Blessing about children we've got
[19:41] we got four children of our own and uh
[19:43] they have produced 11 grandchildren and
[19:46] then another 11 great grandchildren so
[19:48] now we're we're uh we're well we've got
[19:51] a lot of freezing around they not all
[19:52] freezing but we got them around us so we
[19:54] we thank the Lord everyone's a treasure
[19:57] of life and and uh we appreciate them so
[19:59] much appreciate you all and I appreciate
[20:02] your prayers I know many of folks we've
[20:04] we've uh sat across the table and had
[20:06] much joy and fellowship and I want to go
[20:09] into names because uh I'll sure run
[20:12] short anything sometime I S at my own
[20:14] name I I forget my own name so I won't
[20:16] try doing that but God bless all of you
[20:18] this this evening and uh if I could have
[20:21] tried to say something that is that is
[20:23] worthwhile because I do believe uh even
[20:26] if we read one scripture it's worth
[20:28] while uh because we have re we have
[20:31] realized by Revelation that that the
[20:34] book here that was written was not just
[20:36] a man that put it together we know that
[20:39] men describe it but it was God that put
[20:43] it together am and so so particularly
[20:46] that when he finished writing this word
[20:48] and we seen the angel of this age uh
[20:51] come to that point where he he
[20:54] challenged the world that this would be
[20:55] the age where we would come back to
[20:58] perfe Perfection of the word this would
[21:00] be the first age in its fullness for it
[21:03] would bring on the resurrection and the
[21:06] Rapture that this would be all the other
[21:08] ages now remember we know that the day
[21:10] of Pentecost was the Perfection of God
[21:13] coming down but remember that brid tree
[21:16] had to
[21:17] die to show that she had the same Zoey
[21:20] life in her that was in Jesus Christ
[21:22] when he laid down his life now she laid
[21:24] her down her life and in 2,000 years now
[21:27] been resurrected
[21:29] and back up to now and now we've
[21:31] reaching the age of
[21:32] perfection the maturity the full
[21:35] adoption as we know that and we've
[21:37] watched all these glorious things but
[21:39] even the prophet said so much that so
[21:41] much as a jot or a tit as the Bible say
[21:44] if it would be be removed it would
[21:46] either take the name your name out of
[21:48] the book of life or add the plagues of
[21:50] the whole scripture so much so that God
[21:53] watches over his word and you know in
[21:56] the prophet when he he preached and many
[21:58] times he would come to Junctions of life
[22:01] and he'd come to the place and sometimes
[22:02] he'd stop and he say I just don't know
[22:04] where to go sir is this the time he
[22:06] would say and they begin to preach
[22:07] things like that not knowing knowing it
[22:10] would be but when it would be and I
[22:12] think we're still there every time I've
[22:13] had several of the people ask me said
[22:15] brother man where are we at at this time
[22:17] I said I don't know but we're still on
[22:19] this side of the
[22:20] Resurrection but we're getting all
[22:23] getting awfully close yeah not because
[22:25] I'm old I might even fall asleep but I
[22:29] like what brother Braham said have you
[22:30] ever hear that you say William Braham
[22:32] died he said don't you believe
[22:34] it he might have fallen asleep but sons
[22:38] of God Daughters of God don't
[22:40] die they have Zoey eternal life in them
[22:43] ordained by God but so much so that we
[22:47] we realize and now we've seen the tree
[22:49] of
[22:50] knowledge has so caught up to the Tree
[22:54] of Life that of course that's what
[22:56] Satan's been trying to reproduce in his
[22:58] own way to get people to eternal
[23:02] life they don't want to die no more than
[23:04] we do the world doesn't everybody wants
[23:06] to live they're trying look at the look
[23:08] at the doctors and the look at the
[23:11] machines of this
[23:13] world they're trying to keep the people
[23:15] happy they're trying to keep them
[23:18] healthy and there there's more suicides
[23:21] and and and murders and ravishes and
[23:25] evil and more deaths and more hospitals
[23:27] and more people just crowding everywhere
[23:29] hardly you can see we got H Hospital in
[23:34] Saskatoon I when when I get a sick call
[23:36] I I I hate so where's that University Oh

[23:42] first of all to find a parking spot then
[23:45] you get get inside and then you walk
[23:47] mile nearly just to get to a different
[23:49] wing and then you go off to that Wing
[23:51] just hundreds of Acres of of what we
[23:55] call better environment
[23:58] better places to be healed
[24:00] in and yet sicker and more sin than ever

[24:08] course of this world but look at how man

[24:56] thought well I know I had another
[24:57] password so I punch that one no that
[24:59] wasn't it three passwords that I knew
[25:01] over in my life that I'd had and uh none
[25:04] of them
[25:05] worked and I was thinking my I wonder if
[25:09] I'm way off or just a little
[25:12] off cuz you don't
[25:16] know I get when I got home finally I
[25:18] just couldn't I wouldn't work I couldn't

[25:27] the place where you B bought the phone
[25:30] that's uh that's you know that where do
[25:31] we go when we have trouble the place
[25:33] where we started from that's why we're
[25:36] here
[25:36] tonight in case we've left something
[25:39] out and I went to the the desk and said
[25:42] oh said it's your password said got to
[25:44] go over here and they they they're the
[25:46] ones that will fix the password went
[25:48] over there and said oh if it's your

[25:54] said oh my is that serious he said yeah
[25:57] I said we we can't get to it he said
[25:59] punch it in again so I punched in what I
[26:01] thought I knew and uh punched it in he
[26:04] looked at it oh he said uh There It Is
[26:09] Well I said was the password right yes
[26:11] everything but at the end you had put a
[26:14] little explanation
[26:17] mark just one jot or tit out that's
[26:21] right well I thanked him very kindly and
[26:24] walked down and said the Lord said
[26:26] see that's e how close Satan's got it
[26:30] just one word out one dot out that's
[26:34] right now you know that all of us that's
[26:36] the way I seen I've seen your password
[26:37] everywhere you can't get in there unless
[26:38] you do it exactly the way you put it in
[26:42] there you know that's why I thought
[26:44] that's something the Lord said you see
[26:45] that's what I'm doing I'm
[26:48] honing brushing a little bit do a little
[26:50] bit more that's right he saw his lady
[26:53] stand at the
[26:55] end sinless spotless amen amen there
[26:59] wasn't one part of Creed in her she was
[27:03] purely
[27:04] unadulterated the image of
[27:07] Christ said oh you don't know it's that
[27:10] no but you see if you look at the flesh
[27:12] you'll never find it that's right
[27:14] because that one hasn't been redeemed
[27:15] yet that's what we're waiting on knowing
[27:18] that the soul must be in right position
[27:21] for that body to change I'm going to
[27:23] read a scripture if you would and uh uh
[27:26] if you could stand with me this is just
[27:29] um
[27:31] um the brother asked me he said what's
[27:33] your text I said I don't know tell you
[27:35] put in your own text afterwards I just
[27:37] felt like I'd just come and talk to the
[27:39] church and then I know once I read the
[27:40] word that's Eternal amen now I want to
[27:43] read Isaiah the 26th chapter for a
[27:46] little uh jump off here tonight on a few
[27:49] thoughts but the first four verses read
[27:51] like
[27:52] this in that day shall this song Be Sung
[27:56] in the land of Judah we have a strong
[27:59] City Salvation will God appoint for
[28:01] walls and Bullocks open ye the gates
[28:05] that the righteous nation which keepeth
[28:07] the truth may enter
[28:09] in thou will keep him in perfect peace
[28:13] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[28:15] trusteth in thee trust ye in the Lord
[28:20] forever for in the Lord Jehova is
[28:23] Everlasting
[28:25] strength father thank you for your word
[28:28] and I pray that from here you would you
[28:31] would lead the path as to the words
[28:34] spoken tonight that would help us along
[28:36] the way in Jesus Christ's name I ask it
[28:39] amen you can be seated if you would I
[28:42] wanted to take from
[28:45] there that I so love that thou will keep
[28:49] him in perfect
[28:52] peace whose mind and heart is
[28:55] stayed on thee not just once in a while
[28:58] drift in but anchored and settled and uh
[29:02] you know peace is such a glorious
[29:05] thing well I know we sing about it we
[29:08] talk about it we sang songs of Peace but
[29:10] the reality of peace is such a glorious
[29:12] reality that it it it passes all
[29:16] understanding when you ever get that
[29:17] real peace in your heart that you know
[29:19] you come from God and you're going back
[29:20] there and that you know that he thought
[29:22] of you before the foundation world for
[29:24] remember the new birth is the revelation
[29:26] of Jesus Christ to you personally
[29:29] not my sister nor my brother but it's me
[29:31] Lord he and I and you know we always
[29:33] like to have our name included in life
[29:36] don't
[29:37] we yeah we we love to hear our own name
[29:42] especially when it's good it's bad we
[29:44] kind of
[29:45] say wait a minute but when we the good
[29:48] news and this this this Bible this
[29:51] message is good news it it is the good
[29:54] news it is the news above all newses
[29:57] that there's not one single thing in the
[29:59] world can match it that can put a place
[30:02] a person in a
[30:03] position for rapturing Faith but this
[30:07] message in itself and I believe
[30:08] personally and I believe you do too that
[30:10] this message of the Angel no matter how
[30:12] the we've had all of the different
[30:14] doctrines around it bombarded and the
[30:16] the mystery has not been so much about
[30:18] standing in this age but to stand above
[30:20] all the fanaticism that's followed this
[30:22] message every age is the same I've been
[30:25] now a Christian what well preaching uh
[30:28] 1970 do the math some 52 years and 54
[30:34] years and been preaching and I found
[30:36] myself that all these years has been a
[30:38] constant side wind and a headwind and a
[30:40] tailwind and uh sometimes Tailwinds real
[30:43] good but it pushes too fast and but it's
[30:45] life and you find that you just when
[30:47] things like a church pastor you know
[30:49] what I'm talking about just when things
[30:50] go real good watch something rise up see
[30:53] it's there to to hold the balance in
[30:55] things and uh it was all every time we
[30:58] prayed someone asked a while ago how
[31:00] come we don't see more miracles in in
[31:02] among the Christians I said I don't know
[31:05] God's the one that made the promise all
[31:07] I know is I believe what he said that's
[31:09] right amen if it's more important to
[31:11] just see the healing than
[31:13] Miracles then then I so I looked at I
[31:15] heard what brother B talk about one day
[31:16] and he said well said if if God would
[31:18] just give you miracles every time he
[31:20] said why we take it totally for granted
[31:22] after a while we just say well you know
[31:24] and I do believe we do when we pray and
[31:26] ask sincerely and if it doesn't doesn't
[31:28] happen we should be surprised right we
[31:31] should be surprised I had a niece I have
[31:34] a niece rather well she's not a kid
[31:36] anymore she's you know she's a she got
[31:38] she's around 60 years old but about 10
[31:41] years ago she was she was diagnosed with
[31:43] cancer and uh I'm not even going to go
[31:46] into the details of it but but
[31:49] uh but it was serious and they they were
[31:52] supposed to remove ly glands and so on
[31:54] and and uh it was definitely not it was
[31:57] it was it was going to kill her and uh
[32:01] and one day she's in Joe she' been
[32:04] prayed she had got hands laid on every
[32:06] Anointed with O and she had Faith she
[32:08] made confessions constantly said with
[32:10] her Stripes I'm healed amen no matter
[32:11] how sick she got what the doctor said
[32:13] just said her with his stripes I'm
[32:14] Healed one day in a service just like
[32:16] this there I believe it wasn't Wednesday
[32:18] night it might have been Sunday morning
[32:20] she was uh there was she was sitting
[32:21] there and she had a great big lump on
[32:24] her
[32:25] side and she knew that it was moving
[32:29] into place
[32:30] where she would have to do something God
[32:33] would have to do something or it would
[32:35] take her life and and just while the
[32:38] song service was going on I I believe
[32:41] I'm not quite sure the details my wife
[32:43] women are much more on details than I am
[32:45] but I'm just going to go through
[32:48] this something inside of her felt like
[32:51] said why don't you just stand up and
[32:53] thank the lord well she was sitting on
[32:55] the edge and her husband was sitting
[32:57] with her and something you know
[32:58] something oh you'll be a spectacle and
[33:01] and you know he said something impressed
[33:03] her just stand up and Worship the
[33:06] Lord so after she about about the third
[33:09] time she got up and just stood there for
[33:11] a while and worshiped the Lord while
[33:14] they're singing all alone she was
[33:16] standing for what I
[33:18] understand and then she felt something
[33:20] just like come over start like the
[33:23] anointing you know sometimes we feel it
[33:25] said oh you know all of a sudden
[33:26] everything dissolves just feel real
[33:29] good and all such a piece of her faith
[33:31] come to her not didn't even realizing
[33:34] and as she sat down she felt like this
[33:36] and the lump was completely
[33:40] disappeared and she told her husband
[33:43] that feel this publicly she wasn't
[33:46] afraid she said feel it it was
[33:49] gone and for about five seven years I
[33:52] think
[33:53] now not a not a sign about a year ago
[33:58] they come back in a different place
[33:59] different
[34:00] area she went into treatments this time
[34:03] and
[34:05] uh she was going through the treatments
[34:07] and about she got in about halfway and
[34:10] one day something just said to her he
[34:12] healed me once he's still the same
[34:17] healer and she made that confession he
[34:20] heal me once he me twice he's healed me
[34:23] how many times has he forgiven me over
[34:26] and over and over is the same Lord she
[34:29] went through some treatments one day she
[34:31] told the doctor said Doctor um I'm just
[34:35] going to stop the treatments for a while
[34:38] and he kind of like nodded and no
[34:40] accepted and said yes all right we we we
[34:43] respect
[34:44] that so she kept taking checks and they
[34:47] kept going back said just we need to go
[34:48] run all the tests and run through and
[34:50] see how you how you've come along and
[34:52] just before we left here now or we on
[34:54] the road we got a
[34:56] text and said that doctor said we can't
[34:58] find a trace of the
[35:01] cancer he was wounded for our
[35:03] transgression he was
[35:05] bruised the next person he does not heal
[35:08] all but there's one thing and I always
[35:11] like this what brother Braham said when
[35:12] you and I as Christians if somebody ever
[35:16] got healed and if you meet that same
[35:18] condition God's obligated to his word
[35:21] he's obligated when when you saw a
[35:23] sinner find peace and if got filled with
[35:26] the Holy Ghost and you you know what he
[35:28] was like and then he was like what he's
[35:29] like afterwards when when God saved that
[35:32] sinner if he saved him once you meet and
[35:35] I meet that same condition have to do
[35:36] the same with us fill you with the Holy
[35:38] Ghost how will I get filled with the
[35:39] Holy Ghost he said he promised it you
[35:41] don't even have to ask for it you know
[35:43] that it said repent and be baptized in
[35:46] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[35:47] the remission of your sins and you shall
[35:49] it goes with a promise you don't even
[35:51] have brother B say you don't even have
[35:52] to pray for it it's already a promise
[35:55] look at what happened to people that
[35:56] didn't have a promise yeah you know I
[35:59] think of Eve in the beginning when she
[36:01] sinned she didn't have a covenant God
[36:04] had to create one and make one or she'd
[36:06] have died right there
[36:09] altogether but you
[36:11] know the word that Satan read to her
[36:14] brought to her said surely Thou shalt
[36:16] not
[36:18] die she started dying the moment she
[36:21] disbelieved the word that's the acts
[36:24] that follow shows what we've disbelieved
[36:27] yeah that's right but remember and she
[36:30] had no Covenant that's the reason why
[36:32] when you hear Brother bam saying about
[36:33] you know how God came down slew a lamb
[36:37] clothed them with those skins to cover
[36:41] their sin that's the first time the
[36:44] Covenant came remember she didn't have
[36:46] the abrahamic Covenant then yet but
[36:49] David later on when he s what would call
[36:52] almost the worst thing you could think
[36:54] of right when he had everything in his
[36:56] hand he wouldn't have to do what he did
[36:58] but he sinned backsp that's right you
[37:01] know and when Nathan the prophet came to
[37:07] him and you know how David he you know
[37:10] usually when we think maybe and I'm just
[37:13] going to be honest like when we think
[37:15] that our sin is hid or nobody's going to
[37:16] know about and we stand say I'm not
[37:18] guilty I didn't do
[37:20] that you know that's the nature of the
[37:23] of the sinful nature first time you know
[37:25] that in a little child yeah right right
[37:28] mom comes to the closet and the cookies
[37:30] that she had set aside for the evening
[37:33] people guests all of a sudden there's a
[37:35] few
[37:37] missing when she asked the kids who Who
[37:39] had who took these cookies I didn't do
[37:42] it you know right there you go right to
[37:44] say that's the
[37:46] one the others W you make a
[37:49] move I didn't do it you know when David
[37:53] oh he was so ready to why said that fell
[37:56] said bring him here said we'll judge him
[37:58] right
[37:59] now kill him take his life take from him
[38:03] what he did Nathan said you are that
[38:06] man but
[38:09] surely you will not die use the same
[38:13] words but now there was a covenant
[38:16] that's right amen that stood for him it
[38:19] wasn't Abraham it wasn't it wasn't David
[38:22] it was the Covenant that stood for him
[38:25] listen here church tonight it isn't you
[38:27] and I we fail daily but it's the
[38:30] Covenant of the spoken word God said now
[38:33] what kind of a covenant have we got that
[38:35] was still not perfect or he would not
[38:37] have spoke of another Covenant but when
[38:39] Jesus died on Calvary and said it's
[38:42] finished when he said it's finished it's
[38:45] till the day you are transformed if you
[38:47] believe that with as a predestinated
[38:50] seed quickened and remember there's no
[38:52] way we can come to Christ except he
[38:54] draws us first no man can come to me
[38:56] except my father draws me first and if
[38:57] God's drawing God Drew you the first
[38:59] time something inside begin to realize
[39:02] this is not meise God I always said that
[39:06] I I I you know what i' I'd been sometime
[39:09] when I was young Christian I knew I was
[39:11] saved I'd been baptized but every time
[39:13] something went wrong I said there devil
[39:14] said die you don't have the Holy Ghost
[39:17] or you wouldn't be doing
[39:19] that I said Lord as long as I'm doubting
[39:22] it I know I haven't got
[39:24] it but I remember one day when I was
[39:27] pray and at the
[39:29] altar when I got up at that from that
[39:31] altar that evening and walked out of the
[39:32] church and on my way
[39:34] home I knew something had
[39:37] happened I notic immediately afterwards
[39:40] from that time from that time Satan has
[39:45] hit me from every
[39:46] direction sickness trial home finances
[39:50] Church breakups every
[39:54] direction but the anchor is always held
[39:58] I know that it was him that gave me the
[40:00] Holy Ghost and though tested and tried
[40:02] but it was an anchor and the way I know
[40:04] it that the desire of sin was
[40:07] gone oh yeah I still slipped and fell
[40:10] and still
[40:11] do we still do but brother B says you
[40:14] know what happened to you when you know
[40:16] the desire of sin is
[40:19] gone the desire to dis believe the word
[40:21] is gone there's nothing in you I know
[40:24] there's things in our lives that comes
[40:25] daily and remember I like I I I love the
[40:28] way the prophet took those things he
[40:30] said one little lady and you know the
[40:32] stories you've listened to the tapes
[40:33] like I
[40:34] have how many times you catch those
[40:37] little things a lady standing there and
[40:39] had the dream you know about her
[40:40] standing in the pure water and so on
[40:41] which I won't go into and but you know
[40:43] the dream and uh well first of all he
[40:46] said the interpretation said you're
[40:48] you're a Christian you're you're you're
[40:50] pure Christian oh but brother R I make
[40:52] so many mistakes he said sister you must
[40:55] not look at that you must look at your
[40:58] desire for he watches your desire he
[41:01] watches you as a desire as what is in
[41:04] your heart
[41:08] see when he broke down in Ephesians if
[41:11] you read that you know let's just read
[41:13] let me just read that for you I'm I'm
[41:14] read that little part in Ephesians is
[41:16] it's too good to
[41:21] bypass but Ephesians the the second
[41:26] chapter in verse
[41:30] 11 wherefore remember that ye being in
[41:33] time past Gentiles In the Flesh well you
[41:37] know what the Gentiles were
[41:39] heathens watch what he said who are
[41:42] called on circumcision by that which is
[41:44] called circumcision in the flesh made by
[41:46] hands that at that time ye were without
[41:49] Christ being aliens from the
[41:51] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[41:53] from the covenants of
[41:55] promise not even a promise we weren't
[41:58] even
[42:01] included oh what how marvelous we
[42:05] weren't even
[42:06] included the promises was for Israel
[42:08] wasn't for
[42:09] us having no hope and without God in the
[42:13] world but now in Christ Jesus ye who
[42:17] sometimes were far off are made nigh by
[42:19] the blood of Christ oh the blood of
[42:23] Jesus that washes white as snow amen for
[42:28] he is our peace now that's what I like
[42:31] about I'm talking about peace he is our
[42:33] peace who hath made both one and hath
[42:35] broken down the middle wall of partition
[42:37] between
[42:38] us what what what did the prophet teach
[42:41] us in the scripture said about how when
[42:43] Jesus came he said he bridged the Gap
[42:46] that's right back to
[42:48] God he is that fountain that bridge that
[42:52] puts man back in
[42:54] Fellowship when they left Eden he's back
[42:56] in that Fellowship
[42:57] Church you realize tonight that we are
[42:59] at the very brink of the transformation
[43:02] of these bodies that there's not another
[43:04] church age coming there's just a honing
[43:06] down a little here a little there you

[43:37] same having abolished in his flesh the
[43:40] imity even the law of

[44:10] true voice in the world there's not two
[44:12] prophets there's not two voices in the
[44:14] world it's not my voice or your pastor's
[44:16] voice it's the it's God's voice that's
[44:19] speaking back that's right we're not
[44:22] wondering if this message is right even
[44:23] many times it looks like something oh it
[44:25] missed the mark missed the mark and you
[44:26] know this critics are saying everywhere

[44:48] Mysteries oh no it's not well you stay

[44:55] Pentecostal or the minites or any of
[44:57] them try to fix them back up again how
[44:59] are you going to how you going to do it
[45:00] when the the life is already
[45:01] [Music]
[45:03] left the life is no longer in Luther's
[45:05] message it's the same sanctification
[45:08] Same Spirit that went all the way
[45:10] through but you try to take this
[45:12] message you know and I'm let me I'll be
[45:15] very kind gentle
[45:19] loving I I am I am but I say this you
[45:23] can never you can never change the the
[45:27] direction that God's going amen just
[45:30] stay in the direction he's walking
[45:32] that's right from glory to glory to
[45:35] glory he's changing you there's
[45:38] preachers around this message that are
[45:39] trying to change the course of the
[45:42] ministry we're not going back we're
[45:46] going
[45:47] forward I'm all for everything I'm I'm
[45:50] for excitement for joy and peace and joy
[45:52] and but we're not going for any subject
[45:54] alone we're walking in all of the light
[45:55] of the world Amen stay right there keep
[45:58] right on walking somebody tries to
[45:59] isolate a little part and put pull it
[46:01] apart watch
[46:03] it the message doesn't change amen every
[46:07] time brother B when went to a certain
[46:08] place and said now I've walked till this
[46:10] place he said but now I'm waiting here
[46:12] it is then he come said now I wondered
[46:14] of all those things he said now here it
[46:15] is Sir is this the time and he went by
[46:18] there and he said now watch come back to
[46:20] this tape he said later on said remember
[46:21] I told you this this and that right how
[46:24] many times have we done that as
[46:25] ministers there's a little question
[46:26] comes up or little something then we go
[46:28] back and search it out and say but but
[46:30] he said this over here but it sounds
[46:31] like it's contradicting just keep it
[46:33] walking a little
[46:35] bit there wasn't all the light back
[46:38] then even there comes around in the
[46:40] remember how he used to say h th talk
[46:42] about the Seven Seals he said it's the
[46:44] back part of the book he said it's not
[46:45] even written in the book that's what he
[46:47] used to say right but about the third
[46:49] seal he said I was wrong it's written
[46:53] there but our spiritual eyes was
[46:55] withheld from it amen as Daniel had been
[46:58] told and John was told that it wouldn't
[47:00] be it wouldn't be revealed to the time
[47:02] of the
[47:03] end so he said God withheld it from us
[47:06] and didn't let us know all the Mysteries
[47:08] until this age but now he pulled it back
[47:11] and let us know then he took that
[47:12] mystery and revealed the rest the Myster
[47:14] kept on going kept right on climbing
[47:15] that's right am tell what what did we
[47:17] see Behold the Lamb of God Christ The
[47:20] Mystery of God revealed that's who's
[47:22] that's that's who we're talking let me
[47:23] read a part here in a little message and
[47:26] and you know
[47:27] I'll get to talk here all night and and
[47:30] uh but I love this little part in in uh
[47:33] the invisible Union oh it's a good one
[47:37] the invisible Union praise God you just
[47:41] think could God do something right in
[47:43] the midst of us and one get it and not
[47:45] the other one he could and he does am so
[47:49] we pray
[47:52] Lord include me include me amen listen
[47:56] to the little paragraph here 262 it said
[47:58] he the bridegroom took away your shame
[48:02] and put it in the sea of God's
[48:03] forgetfulness by the washing of the
[48:05] Water by the word and the blood and the
[48:08] blood of life that's what the Bible said
[48:11] your first husband of your marriage to
[48:13] the world the anointed bridegroom which
[48:16] for ordained you has washed you by the
[48:19] washing of the Water by the church he
[48:21] said he said no no he said by the word
[48:26] you might find that Alm like he goes on
[48:28] and and and kids a little bit said but
[48:30] not in God's word by the washing of the
[48:33] Water by the word how many times you
[48:35] tell us just don't get out of the water
[48:38] so but I oh Lord I'm still I got a
[48:40] little malice I got a little jealousy
[48:41] Lord that isn't right that's
[48:44] right you I let me let me brag about you
[48:47] a little bit here in Lim
[48:49] up I know you got at least three major
[48:51] churches around the area and I've gone
[48:53] to three so I guess I'm quite
[48:55] charismatic
[48:59] well let me tell you one thing God's
[49:01] very charismatic to his own that's right
[49:05] can you imagine him walking in here
[49:06] tonight and say I don't see a I don't
[49:08] see one fault one
[49:10] Sinise I don't see one there the only
[49:13] one can say that he who made the
[49:15] Covenant when I see the
[49:17] blood I will pass over you now when I
[49:20] see the token the life of that blood I
[49:23] will pass over
[49:25] you but I I say this with respect we've
[49:28] got to there too I've watched it little
[49:30] by little all the you know the pressures
[49:33] and the and the the things that that
[49:36] veered left and veered right in our
[49:38] place and I say that with uh with love
[49:41] yet respect I've seen it where out of a
[49:44] church six different churches would
[49:46] start just Every Which Way wouldn't talk
[49:48] to each other walk on the other side of
[49:49] the streets pay no attention act like
[49:51] you're rank Sinners or
[49:55] worse but you know what that causes you
[49:57] to do say God God be merciful to them
[50:01] Lord have
[50:02] mercy and there's no room for jealousy
[50:05] in the body of Christ if one prospers
[50:08] more than the other I you know the one
[50:10] that t talked to brother Bram said about
[50:12] about his church back then when they
[50:13] were struggling there and the brother uh
[50:16] you know on 60 the churches around
[50:19] Jeffersonville and uh we went to the
[50:21] churches when I was there I remember
[50:23] brother ve went and preached at one of
[50:24] the churches there and back in ' 65 so
[50:26] we would during the day we went and
[50:27] heard the messages preach brother
[50:28] brother veale preached in the evening in
[50:30] the in the sermons that brother Brown
[50:31] preached but that time everybody all the
[50:34] brothers still playing the same sandbox
[50:36] and we're all we're all walking in the
[50:38] light and what we
[50:41] had but then of course you know the
[50:44] message God pulls it back to see what
[50:47] we're going to do about it now I seen he
[50:49] he left it with us we said now watch you
[50:52] notice that God hasn't added one word to
[50:54] his message hasn't been one more word
[50:56] spoken after he finished that's amen cuz
[50:59] it's
[51:00] finished he that heareth my word the
[51:04] Vindication of the hour that we live in
[51:07] amen that is God speaking to the age out
[51:10] of this comes a bride listen how
[51:12] beautifully he put this here washing by
[51:14] the Water by the word right Amen brother
[51:18] Bram never corrected emotionalism he
[51:21] never said it was wrong to be excited
[51:23] and speak in tongues and so on he said
[51:25] just put them in the right place amen
[51:27] true remember how the how the gifts were
[51:29] operating and one would jump up and
[51:31] interrupt the pastor and so on he said
[51:34] now that's not the Holy Spirit he said
[51:36] the Holy Spirit doesn't interrupt
[51:40] itself but put it in its rightful place
[51:43] and'll be a message to the church to
[51:45] keep it clean am every gift that God
[51:48] puts in the church is to keep it clean
[51:50] amen amen you know your pastor would
[51:52] appreciate a real good gift operating
[51:54] according to the message of the hour
[51:56] it'll keep sin out keep clean out keep
[51:59] keep all the jealousy the carnality
[52:02] out we're there now we don't need any of
[52:04] this where we're going it won't be there

[53:34] somebody took my place God amen amen we
[53:39] should still deserve to die that's right
[53:43] but he's not watching you he's watching
[53:44] the

[54:27] this Bible you know critics and and some
[54:29] real spiritual people from time to time
[54:31] when we were in the every once a while
[54:33] they'd Hold Up A Spoken Word Book and
[54:34] and the Bible said which one would you
[54:36] choose on the Bible calls it foolish
[54:40] questioning cu the two are one that's
[54:43] right there's not two there's not two
[54:45] Bibles there not two messages you're
[54:47] either the word of God I'm either the
[54:48] word of God made manifest or not amen
[54:51] for the Bible there's only one Bible but
[54:55] the life of that Bible is the word
[54:58] that's living in human beings it's
[55:00] expressed he continues to tell us here
[55:03] in a very very beautiful way all that
[55:05] spiritual union he said uh watch
[55:09] it just watch the Bible and say what
[55:12] would happen it's happening day by day
[55:14] why is accumulating so fast here in in
[55:16] these deserts and thinking like he's

[55:45] born again of the Holy Spirit and the
[55:48] love of God takes over and the desire of
[55:51] unbelief is gone that's right yes sir

[56:07] you again you never did
[56:10] iten you were accused of it by the

[56:18] predestinated to be a son and a daughter
[56:20] of God you're standing there washed and
[56:22] your old book of divorcement is put away
[56:24] and it's dead absolutely out of his
[56:26] existence even in the mind of

[56:33] The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in
[56:35] the blood of Christ precious virtuous

[56:49] he might take you which were
[56:52] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[56:57] am oh my when I see the blood
[57:00] predestinated in the boo just stop a
[57:02] moment and think back go out now let
[57:05] your soul Reach Out said just think I
[57:08] was in the bosom of the father before he
[57:11] thought thought and when the first time
[57:14] he thought I was there and sent out his
[57:17] Spirit but I was only it caught me only
[57:20] in this last age that's right but if I'd
[57:22] been in Luther's age you would have
[57:23] caught me there if I was in West's age
[57:25] you would have caught me there true but
[57:27] it brooded you and I out in this age of
[57:30] all the millions of
[57:32] people how come something happened
[57:34] inside of you and you've said you walked
[57:36] away from every Creed and Dogma that man
[57:38] put out this said now let me walk with
[57:40] the word
[57:42] aise when I see that amen oh that's
[57:46] beautiful it it comes to real close I'll
[57:47] just I'll close with it that become
[57:50] flesh and manifest that he might take
[57:52] you which are predestined in the bosom
[57:55] of the father before the beginning the
[57:58] same as he was he was the great
[58:01] attribute of God God Called
[58:03] Love see brother Chad you just said that
[58:06] here that is the attribute of all of
[58:09] God's
[58:11] Expressions do you ever stop to think
[58:13] that he wouldn't have to do
[58:14] anything just man do it speak it but in
[58:18] him has so many attributes and you think
[58:21] it'll end when we get our Immortal Life
[58:24] oh my it's a whole new dimension I
[58:27] haven't been there yet but I get we
[58:30] we've we've heard from somebody that
[58:31] went across and brought back some
[58:35] evidence oh when he come back he said
[58:37] you know what I saw you
[58:39] there brother Bram said I he saw me
[58:41] there you know what cuz I'm a Believer
[58:43] he had to see me there I might have been
[58:46] very little but I was there I believe
[58:49] that I stand on that's my life that's my
[58:53] joy whatever you were
[58:56] you are a servant of God whatever God
[58:58] wants you to do where your place
[59:01] is if your place is here in the
[59:03] Tabernacle be the best Christian you can
[59:06] be walk with the Lord pray for your
[59:09] sister churches it's always good pray
[59:12] for the pray for the elect lady around
[59:13] the
[59:15] world Amen oh sometimes God just keeps
[59:18] us separated right now we'd become a
[59:19] great big organization so he just kind
[59:21] of shuffles us around and said just be
[59:23] humble wait a minute you're going to a
[59:25] land where you be one God placed in the
[59:27] church some Apostles prophets teachers
[59:29] pastors placed them there by the virtue
[59:32] of his own
[59:34] predestination and you were that to
[59:37] begin
[59:39] with your first wedding is an
[59:43] olded you never done it
[59:46] amise in the first place because there's
[59:48] only one thing could do it that would be
[59:52] God come down himself and took your
[59:55] place in the form of the Son of God
[59:57] Jesus Christ and washed you by the
[59:59] washing of the Water by the word the
[1:00:02] word not the denomination wash you by
[1:00:05] the word but if you don't want to if you
[1:00:08] don't stand in the water in the word how
[1:00:10] are you going to get
[1:00:11] washed you're still as spotted as Eve
[1:00:14] was that's the right when I see the
[1:00:16] blood dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood
[1:00:19] shall never lose its power till all the
[1:00:22] ransom Church of God be saved to sin no
[1:00:25] more
[1:00:27] when I see
[1:00:28] that you know David in the Psalms when
[1:00:32] he was preaching he was uh pretty
[1:00:34] excited and he he said fret not thyself
[1:00:37] because of unbelievers Psalms 37 I read
[1:00:40] it every once in a while it just makes
[1:00:41] me feel good then he said trust in the
[1:00:46] Lord and then Delight thyself in the
[1:00:49] Lord then commit thyself to the
[1:00:52] Lord then rest in the Lord that's right
[1:00:56] amen it's a good
[1:00:57] journey then cease from anger
[1:01:01] malice for the meek shall inherit the
[1:01:04] earth and the steps of the righteous are
[1:01:07] ordered of the
[1:01:11] Lord you didn't make up your own mind to
[1:01:13] go a certain
[1:01:15] way something LED you and I've always
[1:01:18] marveled at my you know I you know when
[1:01:20] I first became a Christian we we you
[1:01:23] know you come with I came with a
[1:01:25] Pentecostal understand standing cuz my
[1:01:26] mother and dad were Pentecostal but they
[1:01:28] left the church and they were in latter
[1:01:30] rain when I became old enough and uh
[1:01:34] everything had been been done away with
[1:01:37] and made spiritual like baptism and the
[1:01:39] Holy Ghost and was like there's no more
[1:01:42] like no more covenants like like water
[1:01:44] baptism or communion or foot washing so
[1:01:47] it was all
[1:01:50] spiritualized but then as we begin to
[1:01:51] grow in the message I said whoa my
[1:01:55] communion foot washing
[1:01:58] baptism and they had always been talking
[1:02:00] about a baptism coming and I was think
