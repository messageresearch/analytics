for that purpose Lord not to be seen or to be heard but to come and to cast ourselves upon that stone that was heun out of the mountains without hands father that we could be broken but then put back together by you Lord father for we certainly do not want the other option to be ground in the powder and to be blown away as worthless chaff Lord but we want to Humble ourselves in your presence that that you can build us Lord and make us what you would have us be we just thank you for this opportunity father we know this is your ordained way by the foolishness of preaching that your kingdom would be established here on this Earth and in the hearts of your people so we just yield to that purpose although we are fully conscience of our inability and our unworthiness but you chose man as your agent Lord and we're just trusting that you will do what only you can do through man Lord and to come and to take your word and to feed your people we just commit ourselves to you both speaker and hearer and we just ask that you would come and do what you have predestinated the purpose of this service to accomplish we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you this morning morning certainly good to be with you if you have your Bibles we're going to go to the book of Philippians just like to continue on this thought of the pride of life Philippians chapter 2 beginning with verse three says and let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross God bless you as you would have your seats this morning we'll go from that scripture to Ezekiel chapter 2 verse 2 and this is obviously in contrast to the character that we saw Christ displayed but in Ezekiel 2 it says son of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus sayith the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou Hast said I am God I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and not God though thou set thine heart as the heart of God in verse 17 thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before Kings that they may behold you so we can see very clearly the contrast here between the character of Christ which was appropriate who being worthy of a reputation made himself of no reputation and then we see Lucifer a created being of God who had no right to a reputation made himself of a reputation and we can see how that worked out for each one of those we know that Christ abased himself and was exalted to the right hand of God given a name above all names but Lucifer says here was cast to the ground and to this day has lost his reputation so we see as brother random taught us the way up truly is down in Proverbs 6 just laying a little bit of review and Foundation here for maybe some that hasn't uh caught the first two parts of this we'll just do this very quickly and then we're going to move on but in Proverbs 6 verse 16 it says these six things doth the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination under him a proud look first on the list I think that's very significant pride is the first thing that he mentions a ly tongue and hands that shed innocent blood and heart that deviseth evil imaginations feet that be Swift and running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that Seth Discord among brother moving to First John 2 says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is something that we have got to compat every day it's something as as I said last time we should be actively pursuing in our life it's not a matter of if it's going to be there it is going to be there it's going to be attacking on every every level it's going to be attacking in every situation it's something that we've got to actively pursue because chances are because of the blessings that's been bestowed upon us and because we have a knowledge of the word and because we are so blessed by proper teaching it's probably not going to show up on the black horse or even the red horse we know that's not his tactics it's it's going to come in a in a very subtle way and start working its way in and it's probably going to be a situation that you're right about but remember I can't even believe I'm saying this but remember being right right is not the end all be all you can be right about something and handle it totally inappropriately that's what we've got to be on guard for amen so I just want to read this quote it's obviously become very familiar to you um but this is kind of what's sparked this whole thought process and this this whole uh rearranging of my mind and hopefully that's manifesting somewhat in my life at this point but this quote just really really shook me and brother brandom is referring to Mary and he says so she had Seven Devils cast out of her pride and envy and then he defines what this Pride was he says she thought she was just so pretty and there was no one like her so again now we have our own interpretations of what pride is and how it manifests itself but we have some somebody who has the authority to set the standard of how that actually is and he gives us the example that here's a little lady who no doubt was attractive she had facts to back up her thought process but brother random says that this devil of Pride that was in her displayed itself and manifested itself in her thinking that she was so pretty and there was nobody like her this was a de this was not just you know a bad thought this was not just you know something she needed to get over this was a devil of Pride laying in her life and this is how it manifested so now that we have the standard readjusted and we have an accurate standard when we start comparing oursel to the accurate standard and not the standard that was on our mind now we become as Isaiah and we become as woe as me because we've realized I won't say we I'll say I I've realized over multiple years by comparing myself to a false standard I've had false results I've had wrong results I've conducted myself inappropriately but now that we have a new standard we have an accurate standard woe is me yeah right but remember Isaiah didn't just stay at woe is me he picked himself up he got off the ground and he repented and he made things right and then he heard this call who will go for us God and he says I will go so I'm not saying that you need to rush the process of Woe Is Me In fact I would encourage you to stay in the process of woe is me until it's settled in your mind I'm I'm not encouraging you to take this lightly or to just skim over it certainly stay in woe as me for as long as you need to be there to make things right and to get your standard adjusted but remember that's not where he wants us to stay he has a purpose for us the reason that he would come and reveal these things to us is because he has a purpose for us and that purpose requires us to be thinking differently so he's not a father that he's just going to come and punish us and tell us how bad we are and how we're hopeless and never going to make us he comes and he reveals a new standard to us because he has a purpose for us so we want to allow him to fulfill that purpose but when Jesus spoke and said be thou clean all that left her she became a new person she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own sight remember her outward appearance did not change maybe she dressed differently more modestly I'm not I'm not saying none of that could have changed but I'm saying as far as her facial features and construction there's no record of that changing but what changed was in her heart what changed was in her mind now she did not feel this way anymore but she wrapped herself in the robe of meekness and gentleness and followed the master questions and answers 1957 brother random says now let's take a look back at Cain just take the of his daddy the very start Lucifer in the beginning he was jealous of Michael that's what started the whole trouble jealousy started the whole trouble and the reason that we find oursel in this Fallen condition now 57 washing Jesus's feet brother brandom says when a man thinks that he's just a little bit better than somebody else you're on your road out yeah amen well what if you are better than that person remember the facts aren't necessarily the point brother Brandon said Abraham was a silver dollar lot was a penny but how did Abra Abraham Express that he says here we are and we're having contention we're having our servants fight with each other I'm a silver dollar so I obviously get to resolve this how I see appropriately no not at all he says there's a problem here lot you're my nephew and I love you I tell you what you just do whatever you think is best you look and you pick the best and whatever way you choose I'll go the opposite way amen so the facts that they 's different levels of people and I'm not even about to get into that because I I'll just get myself in trouble I have no no way to I could just say what brother ROM says there's silver dollars and there's pennies how God views that and works that out I have no idea but the problem there's that's not the problem the problem is if we take that into our mind and we start thinking that we're the silver dollar and somebody else is the penny right amen it may even be factual how you would prove that factually I have no idea um but it may even be factual that's not the problem the problem is if we allow that thought into our mind it was factual that Abraham was a silver dollar and lot was a penny but that's not what would was in Abraham's mind or he would have never expressed himself the way that he did he says when you think you're a little bit better than somebody else you're on your road out right not up out 58 the door inside the door he says then there's another little door and that door is called Pride oh that is a hard one to get open you know human beings are just prone to think that maybe they're just a little better than the Jones you know especially here in America so we've got a double portion of this right we're prone to think this way this is why I encouraged you that we have to be actively pursuing this we have to be actively hunting this down because this is not something that's going to come and go this is something that has came in hybridization this is something that we are prone to if if you don't understand what that means I'll try to Define it a little bit if you have a fork in the road and you're prone to something that means you're prone to go that way if there's no other Force pushing you the opposite direction so when you come to a situation and there's two ways to handle it I'm sorry to tell you regardless of how spiritual you are you are prone to handle it wrong and you are prone to handle it with the thought I'm just a little bit better than this person I'm dealing with we first need to acknowledge that that we are prone more likely than not to handle this situation wrong and with the wrong mindset unless there is some type of external or maybe internal force that would shift us away from the way that we are prone to think that I obviously am right in this situation and you are obviously wrong in this situation because I'm prone to think I'm a little bit better than you a little bit maybe not better a little more spiritual than you put whatever word you want to in there you're just a little bit higher than this situation and this person that you're dealing with but there can be an internal Force correct that because Jesus didn't think that way and if we are to have the Holy Spirit Within us then we should be thinking differently we should be as the scripture says letting the mind of Christ be in us so when we can view ourselves appropriately then we're probably more apt to handle the situation correctly to take the wrong fork in the road or I'm sorry to take the right fork in the road but he says human beings are in general prone to think that way we've got to come to terms with that we've got to come to terms when we wake up in the morning and our feet Hit the Floor we are prone to do things wrong and we are going to do things wrong if we don't first commit ourselves and our entire being and our thought process to The Sovereign power of almighty God and especially here in America yeah so let's move on to some new material here brother brandham says in the church age book he says speaking of the first church age the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit this is how the church begin he says but it all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and has became a bit formal that is what was happening back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they begin to be careful about what the world thought of them why would you care what the world thought of you if it was not based on Pride what other reason I mean we would read this statement would think you know how ludicrous that is how silly that is you would think more about what the world would think about you than you do about what God would think about you nobody here is going to sign up for that but it'll come so subtle and you'll be in a conversation maybe even a spiritual conversation and now your pride will raise up and you won't handle it correctly because maybe it'll make you look a little bit bad that is manifesting thinking more of what the world thinks about you than what God thinks about you brother brand says this is how Satan came into the first church age and started ruining it a a little Sly not that they wanted to go be bad bad people not that they wanted to go back into sin not that they wanted to be immoral they simply started considering how is my reputation before the world rather than what does God think of me how does the father view this that's how how easily it will come in he says by the end of the first church age the Deeds of the nicians were flourishing in the local falsifying churches with increasing attempts to spread their influence farther than their own body why would you have a desire to spread your influence farther than your own local body if there was not Pride involved he says its influence was felt upon the true church for men like the Vernal polycarp were calling themselves Bishops with a reference to that title which was not inherent in it according to the word there's your answer you he this this Spirit was trying to raise up Pride at an individual to spread his influence farther than the local assembly so that now he can have a self-proclaimed title of Bishop over not only this local assembly but other assemblies this is the results of being more careful about what the world would think of you than what would God would think of you this is what it leads into it's not just going to stay there it's going to continue to grow and continue to manifest itself even polycarp who I would say we would all take a vote and say had a pretty good reputation but brother brandham calls him out and says even he fell subject to this trying to spread his influence and take a title over more than his local assembly now I want to clarify something there is a big difference between your influence affecting somebody else and you trying to have your influence affect somebody else so if your life your daily life lived according to the word of God is influencing people outside of your local assembly you're not wrong this is good this is what is supposed to happen but if you are trying that's right because you think maybe you're a silver dollar and they're a penny if you're trying to exert your influence over more than the local assembly that's where you're wrong if our day daily lives affect people it should affect people even people in other churches there that's not wrong that's not the issue but this would be especially important for somebody in a uh a role in the church or an officer of the church or a minister in the church to try to be affecting other local bodies for the purpose of raising yourself up or even your local body up of how we're right and you're wrong that's the issue here and that can only be driven by Pride brother brandom said we need thousands of lived voices is thundering out we need those lives thundering out we need those influences going forth but the the motivation behind that influence going forth should not be yourself or your position or a title or a reputation it should be to honor God to honor the father to manifest his word to help a brother and sister somewhere he says and humble thyself now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at and if you want to get anywhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit come around you anywhere with God that means if you want to get that far with God you will never do that if there is an arrogant Spirit around you you first have to deal with that Palmer one Lo caterpillar and cankerworm 1959 brother brandom says and if it so happens that you do not believe he's speaking to the people as before he starts his sermon he says and if it so happens that you do not believe just the things that we speak as of our church doctrine we trust that it will by no means bring an offense because the very first step to successful Christianity and to show that man has received the Holy Spirit is humility real god-given humility that it must be given humbly so here's a man in his own church in his own pull pit getting ready to preach his own Doctrine and he's saying before I do that please don't be offended by that I don't mean to say anything to offend you a man standing having every right to speak whatever God lays on his heart but he knows I can't just say this any way that I want to say this I just can't say this and come off arrogant this may be absolute 100% truth and Absolute Concrete doctrine that I'm getting ready to lay out but if I would say in such a way that would offend you I don't even have the holy spirit yet because the first sign of a true Holy Spirit in an individual is real god-given humility I think we could learn a lot from that example amen how many times have we been quick to correct something and gave no thought to how we correct it of what humility we should do that in but here is a man standing where he has the authority to say what's on his heart and say it as hard as he wants to say it or as soft as he wants to say it and he would first for the sake of the people say I'm going to preach Doctrine this morning I'm going to tell the truth I'm going to lay out what's on my heart but please don't be offended by that it's not my intent to offend how many times have we just taken the word of God and thrown the word of God out there and shot the word of God out there and let the chips fall where they may and say well whatever I told the truth however they responded to it that's on them but we're on a higher plane now Saints we're on a higher plane it's it's not the days of that in the Masterpiece brother brandham said but standing up there with an education polished you know and so forth he's referencing the man that was trying to pull the Pentecostal Church Into The ecumenical movement he's saying he was standing up there with an education polished you know and so forth that's not the way God polishes his he does not polish his with education he polishes in humility in power of His manifested word he says we believe the bride is getting its last polishing down now do you understand why I scold you that ain't because I don't love you I do love you I want a masterpiece for the master I might have to tear a few out like this but I'll have a masterpiece some of these days if I keep it right on this word so brother brandom is coming in the message Masterpiece we just listened to this all together recently and this struck me but remember the quote that we just read brother brandom says in order to start with God never let an arrogant Spirit come around you in order to even prove that you have the Holy Spirit and an experience with God you first that will first be manifested in real god-given humility so this is the starting point humility but now he comes in the Masterpiece and he says God's finishing his Masterpiece and he polishes you when you're sculpting something you don't begin with polishing yeah you start with usually a large hammer or a chisel and there's chunks falling out of it but where where does polishing come in polishing comes in at the end so now this walk with Christ this real true experience of Christ it begins with humility but then it ends with humility this is the conundrum that I ran into when I read this quote about Mary is because I remember the day when I first came to Christ humble I can remember that day and I think we all can remember that day when he Pricks our heart and it usually comes along the lines of something like we recognize we don't have everything figured out and we was probably wrong about something so when now we realize we're wrong and we need a savior and we're not faking humility when that Revelation hits that day we know we know we need help we need help in a bad way we have no problem with humility on that day but now all of a sudden we go through this process and we started out with true humility but then we start learning the word and we start walking in the word and we start learning Doctrine we start learning things and now all of a sudden here we are I'll just I'm not speaking for anybody else I'll speak for myself here we are we come and we're 39 years old and we read this quote about Mary and how her thought process revealed a devil of Pride that was inside her and we compare oursel back to the real standard now and we have this question where did my humility go I had it at one point in time my walk started with this humility there was no faking that but now why am I so hard and why am I so callous and why am I so prideful and why am I so adamant that I've got to be right about everything and why am I so adamant that I've got to have the proper understanding to be the first to say it see this is the conundrum is if it started with humility and he's going to finish this work by polish polishing with humility what happened in the process between these two gaps I tell you what happened the pride of life rose up the pride of life rose up because we learned a few things and there was nothing wrong with learning a few things we should have learned a few things he's rebuilding that tree back and part of that tree is Doctrine but why just because when the life's coming back into that tree and he's putting truth back into it and he's putting truth back into our Lives why when we started out in this in this humble state of humility of knowing we needed a savior and knowing that we were wrong and knowing that we needed help now all of a sudden we've got a few doctrines and we know who the seventh angel is and what Revelation 10:7 means and Malachi 4 now all of a sudden we've where did Pride come with that that's not in the message it was never delivered in the message but now we find ourselves year I keep saying we I'm saying I I well every time I say we just think I I'm not trying to preach at you amen but if the shoe where but through this process it was never delivered to us in Pride or with arrogance that's right but somehow through this process that has R risen up and taken a hold but I thank God that he polishes with humility because he's got a purpose for this image and he's not going to allow this image to be anything other than what his purpose was so he started that out with humility and I guess just because he's God and he knows how we are and he knows how we're prone to be he recognizes the need look when we get to the end of this after I build them up a little bit I'm going to have to polish them again so he knows this he knows this process but brother brandom laid that principle down in the Masterpiece and he says says that we believe the bride is getting its last polishing down its last polishing down is not coming any other way than by humility it's a last polishing of humility that's what the prophet says so I feel that we should just accept the fact that he is going to Humble our he's he's going to make that happen we should not be resistance to the resistant to the fact that he's humbling us whenever we're experiencing situations in our lives that are humbling we should just say thank you God for polishing me we should not resist those because it is what he's going to do and we don't want to come so far down along the road and get to the final stages to where he's simply needing to polish something but you know how it is when you're working on something like a bolt that won't come loose and it's supposed to come loose and you put a little oil on it and you know twist it a little bit easier and it still won't come loose okay you don't keep twisting on it you go get a hammer you go get a torch we don't want to take a process of Simply polishing and make him go back and get his hand Hammer because he will because he has an image in his mind and we are going to match that image yeah remember God is not a man that would lie and God has said I will have a bride without spot or wrinkle it does not say I will have that unless they just really resist my last polishing down he says I will have a bride without spot or wrinkle so when we come to the last polishing down we do not want to be immature and buck up against God because he's a good father he's a good father and he knows how to raise his children appropriately and he knows how to get the results that he wants and he knows deep within our heart we really do want the results that he wants It's just sometimes we can't get over ourselves so he would even let this type out in the natur natural that he would say any father who has a child that would act that way and they won't bring the rod of Correction they're an evil father the point that I'm making is if we're at this stage of a final polishing let's be mature and let's accept that let's not resist that let's not go back to the days of the hammer and the Chisel those are way worse than polishing sandpaper does not feel good on your skin a chisel on your arm feels a lot worse though you will forget about the irritation of sandpaper on your skin when somebody comes along with a chisel or a pickaxe and drives it through your arm we don't want to be spiritually immature okay so now I'm going to take a pivot and as our Pastor said a couple Services ago we're going to go well I don't have a Cow Shed I've got big old kennel so we're going to go around the bigel kennels for a second but I assure you we're going to come back and it'll be a very clear point just hang with me let's turn our Bibles to Mark 11 because remember there is a purpose for this polishing there is a purpose behind his process there is a purpose for Isaiah coming to the point of woe is me it's not just to stay at woe as me there is a purpose for this process amen Mark 11 CH 22 very familiar and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith am remember there is a purpose in this process there is a purpose in this polishing of humility 1959 who is this this is the message right before brother brandham speaks uh preaches speak to this mountain in San Jose California so this is 1959 November 22nd he says so remember this coming week now if the Lord is willing we'll be speaking Monday night the Lord willing upon the issuing in of the new ministry he's referring to the third pole what we commonly know as the third poll now many know that way back from the beginning how the Holy Spirit revealed first before I started on a gift speaking of the sign in the hand and then I came up the west coast and across Canada for three or four years telling you that he said that something else would come which would be far greater than along it came speaking of the second poll of discernment he said then he said just keep humble this is God's instructions for the prophet from the second Pole to the third pole first on the list keep humble keep away from money and all the things of the world remember what all the things of the world are script rely speaking the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life don't never try to be big this is God's instructions to the prophet just stay humble God does not need to be redundant this is the voice of God speaking and there'd be something else greater now that's coming now so God's instructions to his Propet from the second pull to the third pole is to be humble don't try to be big and to stay humble just in case he didn't hear him the first time so this message is preached November of 59 this the squirrels were spoken into existence in ooc at the October and the beginning of November 59 he comes to the Tabernacle and preach is my new ministry um at the beginning of O November and then he goes here to San Jose so hopefully hopefully I don't confuse you but that's the pattern here God's dealing with him he puts them in the woods the squirrels are spoken to into existence he has the incident with Hatty Wright he comes and explains the new ministry and what's going on to the Tabernacle and then he immediately goes to San Jose but these people in San Jose I don't know the the whole backstory but these people in San Jose are very special to the prophet um because he you can just tell when you listen to this he's speaking very personal to them and this is a huge huge part of brother brandom's life this is a major Junction in his life and he tells it at the Tabernacle and then he tells it to the people in San Jose and the the best that I can see he really lays silent on it he doesn't go out spreading this out in all of his meetings so these uh in fact he makes a comment to these people in San Jose because he was just there earlier in the spring and he says this was such a nice atmosphere it was such a nice setting all the ministers were um uh collaborating together and he did three nights there and when he came back and he says and I just didn't think three nights was enough for that kind of atmosphere so this is this is a special setting this is a special situation and there may be some I say this respectfully there may be some old timers in here who know more about that than what I do but I can tell just by listening to this the the tape here this is a setting and a group of people brother brandom knows will receive this and appreciate it and are looking for it he makes the comment he says I told you all that this was on the road when I was here last year I could almost reach out and grasp it but now here it is so just with that little bit of context consider that so he tells them that and who is this and that's the message right before speak to this mountain and speak to this mountain is when brother brandham really Dives in to explaining what's going on with his ministry in this third poll and he says it's been about 3 or 4 years ago when I was just reading over it speaking of Mark 11 scripture I noticed that the tree had withered and I thought just a miracle of God but yet there was something begin to pull in my mind I find that very intriguing the terminology that he would use because remember this is a third pull not a third push or a third press brother brandom is is bearing his soul to us in this process of the transition of his ministry and he's saying that it came I was reading the scripture one day on Mark 11 and I just thought well that was just another miracle but now something something or maybe someone starts pulling on him with this scripture not pressing onto him start start pulling him with this scripture he says it began to pull at my mind have you examined that scripture that you can have what you have said if you say and then believe that you have it you can have what you said this is the voice that's speaking to him have you examined that it's pulling on him have you examined this he says now we had been fishing down at Del Hollow again and that night we caught a nice string of fish but had run out of bait and we were standing throwing our flying lines in Catching little bluegills to bait them with and Mr bankswood said to lwood which both of them was Brothers said we ought to go over there to some old lady she's about 90 years old when we were little Jehovah Witness boys we used to go around there and she'd give us bread and butter you remember that old homemade bread Bank said we ought to go tell her that we are saved and brother brandom says that was the right thing now for 's for time's sake I'm going to have to paraphrase some of this but brother branom said that they had been out there fishing and they had been talking about Mark 11 talking about that scripture and now Banks and L are there they're catching bluegills for their bait to go catfishing and they make this comment Banks makes this comment we should go tell that lady that we are saved now and brother R says he that that was the right thing he says now please try to catch this it's just the way you say things sometimes that changes the whole setup I pray that God will help us catch that Saints the days of just being right are gone we have a word that is so precious now that is not just about being right brother Brandon says just the way you say things now can change everything you can say things and be absolutely 100% right and not get the result God's wanting amen see this is such a higher level we just can't be flipp it with our tongue anymore think the scripture the man who ruleth his tongue is better than him that ruleth a city that's right more powerful than him that ruleth a city oh yeah that's a good principle we we should no Saints this is literally tied to the third pole yes sir this principle is directly tied to the third poll it's the way that you say things sometimes that changes the the whole setup they said just the right thing for just then the Holy Spirit dropped upon me from Heaven somewhere and I said thus sayeth the Lord there will be a resurrection of a little life of some kind of little animal I said I didn't see just what the animal was but it was something that sprung to Life all at once and we'd been talking about this scripture he says we fish all night and the next morning we hadn't caught any fish that night on our Trot lines because we changed the bait to those bluegill and the catfish were not biting on that he says about the time that it got daylight we had all of our Trot lines run we pulled into a little Cove and we were fishing with the fly lines for these big brim and that's just a little larger bluegill so they're fishing for different type of bait and he says so we were fishing for those brim on a fly line and Mr lwood had a reel and a pole and he just dropped it in the water with a great big long hook and a poor little blue had swallowed it plumb down in the bottom of his belly so I'm not going to give you a fishing lesson here but well maybe I am but okay when you're using a fly line you're using a little bitty lur so for a Blu Gill it can it will usually come up to the surface and just suck that in and pop it right into his lip you pull them in you take it out you put them in the bucket to be cut up as catfish bait L's fishing with a regular rod and pole and he's got a really big hook on it so when he drops it down in there brother R says he got to talking he wasn't paying attention so the bluegill comes up eats the bait well obviously because he doesn't set the hook it just keeps eating the bait so now it's got this big hook all the way down inside of us L stops talking pulls it up and he says I wish you just look at here you can't even see the hook and you just grabbed the fish like this and just pulled and pulled the hook out pulled the inters and the gills and everything out of it throwed it out on the water like this to get his hook out and the little fish quivered four or five times and spread it little fins out and died laying there on the water so he said little fellow you shot your last Wad and we went on and I said L you you shouldn't take the hook out like that and I was trying to tell him I said put a smaller hook on and he was just a Farmer Boy you know he never fish very much I find this fascinating I'm not here to preach a new doctrine but I find this fascinating that at the beginning of this third pole which the third pole is based on a vision of fishing at the beginning of this brother brandham is in a boat that's right teaching somebody how to fish exactly what he said he was doing in the vision he was there TR he said a group of ministers at that time but he was trying to show those ministers how to fish he says because I thought I could really teach them how to fish I find this fascinating he's literally doing what the vision said and he's trying to explain to L don't do that you know that's that's not right to do that and not in this message but in another one La answers back and he said well you know that's just the way we do it around here God bless him I'm sure he's a fine brother but it just totally went over his head just totally went over his head his brother Banks had just said the right thing the day before and here's brother brandham trying to explain to him L don't do that that's not right you know you shouldn't just do that to a fish that's wrong way to do it use a small well that's just the way we do it around here I don't care not the right thing to say not the right thing not the right attitude what is that I'll ask you what that is you say well that's just Petty that's Pride that's the way we do it around here yeah right I don't care what you have to say about using a smaller hook Pride that small Pride L you shouldn't take the hook out like that and he says and we was fishing and I was catching and we was catching some pretty nice fish so this conversation happens they keep on fishing catching this bait and he says all of a sudden something happened and coming down of anointing that I've never felt like something said stand up and something said to me speak to that little fish and he will live again the gills were white was hanging out of his mouth and I said little fishy Jesus Christ gives you your life and God in heaven who's my solemn judge that fish turned over and swam down through the water as hard as he could go and now now L gets it if if you read uh compilation of this story in multiple Services uh L L gets it he's like that that was for me because I was being disrespectful and I said little fishy you shot your last W and I didn't care and I just and brother brandom's trying to console him he's like no no that's not it that wasn't it but he gets it he recogniz is under this presence under this anointing I would venture to say it's the same presence that was Walking In The Garden that made Adam and Eve realized they were naked when they were clothed now all of a sudden under this presence now all of a sudden under this new standard under a proper definition La gets it I'm wrong brother R says now the strange thing to me is this how God the Great HOV God would use his power to bring a little fish for we'd cut up two or 300 of them the night before he would use his power to bring that fish to life and I've got at least 300 children on the list up there praying them for a vision to see a vision for them and just about that time he says I'm thinking this and he's expressing this to the brothers he says just about that time something said Mark 11:23 so brother random is confused because he's just experienced an anointing like he's never experienced before on a little fish that they had just cut up two or 300 of them the night before and used them as catfish bait I don't know that I can properly Express this but please understand them catching the fish the little bluegills cutting them up into catfish bait and catching fish catfish off of them was not wrong them killing them fish cutting them up and using them for bait was not wrong a man disrespecting that little fish that little fish's life and just yanking his hook out and pulling his guts and his gills out and throwing him off on the water like he was nothing was absolutely a violation of the character of Jesus Christ you could take that same fish I don't have words to explain the Saints you either catch or do you don't you can catch that same fish respectfully lay it on the board cut it up into pieces and use it for bait and God doesn't have a problem you can catch that same little fish handle it IR irreverently not respect its life yeah and it will grieve the Holy Spirit a little fish we can tell take the word of God and fet each other with it Saints and if it's done in the right manner it does not displease God we can take the word of God and filet each other and not care how it makes the other person feel and you've just violated the very character and essence of God yes using the word to cut is not the issue yeah the word of God is a two-edged sword it's made to cut right amen how you're handling cutting that person is the issue and if that issue is so prevalent that God would use it as an example in our message as a starting point and a springboard for the third poll this principle of how we would handle something that we just view as insignificant this is a little fish how much more so are brothers and sisters maybe not even a brother and sister just an unbeliever a human being brother Ren says I can't wrap my mind around that we' just cut all these up and used them as bait but yet God cared enough about this one that when this one was disrespected yeah and his life not honored yeah he would say I'm going to come on the scene I'm going to come on the scene for that little fishy and I'm going to give it back its life it shouldn't have been done that way and I'm going to use it I'm going to use it to manifest my power there's 300 children over here a prophets praying and waiting on a vision for I'm going to deal with that little fishy it shouldn't have been handled that way I pray that somehow God will allow us to truly grasp that Saints because if we can grasp that principle we'll know how to treat our brothers and sisters we'll know how to treat unbelievers amen people that don't hunt can't wrap their minds around these types of situations but you'll take somebody who hunts and you will go out and you will shoot and you will kill an animal and it will bleed and it will die and you will dress it out and you will take it home and you will eat it and that is not a problem but the same man that will shoot something and kill it and it will bleed and it will die will lose sleep if he shoots and he injures it and it gets away amen you were trying to kill it yeah but now it's wounded you hit a limb or whatever stuff happens I I get it I'm not saying you're a bad person if that happens stuff happens brother random had that happen to him but people can't people you know the anti-hunting community they can't wrap their mind around that like you're out there you're a killer you're no we're not a killer we're Hunters it's a big difference between a killer and a hunter does a hunter kill yes but a hunter a true Hunter is not a killer a hunter will lose sleep and spend hours on his hands and knees out the woods searching for specks of blood to Trail this animal so that it doesn't go to waste or that he can find it and put a finishing shot on it this is the principle and character of Christ it's not to be irreverent and disrespectful even to animal life this is not pleasing to God but this is a principle in the character of God he tells this story and then he this is still in the message speak to this mountain he tells this story of the little fish now that happened let me try to give you the timeline that would have been 1957 so 1957 this scripture is pulling on brother brandom he has they're talking about this scripture he has this incident where God tells him what to say and he speaks life back into a fish and then this continues to move in 1958 I'm going to get ahead of myself so let me just read this but this incident was in 1957 just hold that in your mind he'd been thinking of this scripture it began to pull on him and in 1957 this manifest himself itself so brother brandom in 1957 knows what's tied to this scripture and furthermore he knows that there is an anointing above what he's experienced in his first and second pools he knows this this is factual because it's been manifested now he declares this openly that anointing that came in that boat that spoke that fish to life that was something totally different than what we've experienced up until this point continuing in this message brother brandom is relaying to the church in San Jose the transition in his ministry and he just tells them the story of the little fish and now he moves into another story he said Fred San a friend of mine bosom friend from Canada was with me in New England campaign last year and we went over in the Adera where I was lost at that time you remember the first service that we preached on this we really labored on this this was a huge turning point in brother ROM's life is when he got lost up on Hurricane Mountain and he realized he wasn't The Woodsman he thought he was and he came back with a changed mindset of Lord I can't can't even hunt without you I can't even fish without you I can't drive my car without you this was a huge turning point in his life and this is something he's relating as part of the change of his ministry he says we were there this would have been in 1958 after the fish incident in 1958 he says we were there in Vermont during the meetings and I wanted to take brother brother Fred over to where at that time it was the only time I was ever lost in the woods and I wanted to show brother Fred where my wife and Billy was waiting for me to come back when I was lost in that snowstorm that night and when we were standing there by the side of the little lint where I'd had M and Billy laying in this Linton when I was up hunting bear when we were standing there I stepped out to one side and the Lord this the spirit of the Lord says step out to the side and I stepped out to one side away from uh brother Fred and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon me and I began to shake and the spirit of the Lord said there is a trap set for you be careful what thou sayest remember the transition that we're in he's experienced it with the fish this scripture is pulling on him and now God brings him back to a spefic specific location a specific location that is directly tied to the most humiliating time in his life and it's at this specific location that the Holy Spirit comes and says there's a trap laid for you be careful what you say I find this a in Saints I find this the grace of God because when BR if if ever brother brandham is going to catch a message from the Lord on humility God is orchestrating it so that he's at the place to where he was most humbled remember brother brandom said that that's that was you know he was part Indian and that's what his pride was is he considered himself a pretty good Woodsman but he had to come to a point to realize he wasn't a pretty good Woodsman he wasn't even a pretty good wisman like that was his last thread of Hope of being a man and God snatched that away from him you can't even walk in the woods without getting lost brings him back the best that I can tell that would have been sometime around 1941 this is 1958 you all do the math I can't do it right here several years later numerous years later after he was humbled brings him back to that specific location grace of God says come over to the side and warns him there's a trapla for you be careful what you say he says we got to the meeting that night and I said to the audience remember thus saith the Lord there is a trap set for me and all of you pray that I'll know what to do the right thing when this comes to pass I love this God comes and warns him there's a trap coming there's a trap laid for you he comes to the pull pit before the whole people and says there's a trap laid for me and I've got this I'll handle it don't you all worry no no no no he just came from Hurricane Mountain he knows he's not even a good Woodsman saints of God there's a trap laid for me please pray for me that I will handle it correctly please pray that I will know what to do see the change in the mindset see the humility and the next night it happened the devil sent two people a young boy and girl to break up the meeting and that was in Vermont they were both at least 25 years old a peace and when I started preaching he would just grab her and throw her head back and climb up on her and kiss her and Carry On and just act awful in the meetings and the ushers couldn't make him be quiet and I said to him from the platform I said young man don't do that you're attracting the attention while I'm preaching and he just laughed right out at me and I thought oh oh there it is there's the Trap right there and I went right ahead and speaking just the same and oh he got so immoral with her till I had to stop again and I said don't do that sir please I said if you want to make love to the young lady then you leave the building but this is a religious meeting and I said you shouldn't do that please don't do that while I'm preaching and I started again and he just made it worse and then when I said don't and something said to me say what you will and it'll be done this is actually the first opportunity of the spoken word now I'm not trying to confuse you but just understand what I said what I'm saying or where I'm coming from is the fish incident God told him specifically what to do what to say for what situation you understand what I'm saying same I'm not saying it's not the same power I'm just saying this is different because in that situation God said to him you speak to the fish and give it back I give it back its life amen now this is totally different because he says say what you will amen say what you will and it'll be done and I stood there the persperation just running from me something said say blindness it'll be blind say death and they'll pack them out say what you will and I couldn't speak and I couldn't move and then it just left and I thought God what must I do and I turned and he stood there speaking of the boy in the audience and his face white looking at me and I thought what must I say then I turned and looked like before I knowed what I said I said I forgive you of your act and it must have been just the right thing to say it was God trying a reaction on an action that night it was revealed to me that I'd said the right thing I I know it was all leading to something but what was it what to do you know you have to watch with a Divine gift what you do with it remember what Moses did so remember what Moses did he came down he broke the Tabernacles uh the tables he came down and he smoked the rock twice remember what Moses out of out of what you say well that was just his temper why did he have a temper right if it wasn't directly tied to Pride yeah that he thought the people should have been better and should they have absolutely but where was Moses before God got a hold of him I'm sure there were several times God thought about Moses you should have done better and he forgot that when he's dealing with these people yeah brother Brandon points that out he says you've got to watch what you do with the Divine gift remember Moses he says so I must have said the right thing I for give you for you know young John wanted to burn up Samaria one time because they wouldn't feed them Jesus says you don't know what kind of spirit you are yeah young John a type of the Young Bride have we ever wanted to burn up a city because they didn't feed us you put your own situation in there have we ever taken that attitude as as the Young Bride Jesus says you don't even know what Spirit you're of right the son of man came to save life not destroy it and them scriptures just kept pouring in all night so after this incident brother R says these scriptures just keep pouring in reminding him telling him you've done the right thing he said it was revealed to me that night I had made the right decision he says but that was a trap set that Satan would get me all worked up and then make me say the wrong thing Satan would get him all worked up how many times has Satan got us all worked up for 3 days prior to the conversation with our spouse just so we'll say the wrong thing Satan does not care how long he has to ride a white horse before he can get on a red one and before he can jump on a black he will ride a white horse and get you all tore up and all wound up that's right for 30 seconds to take the wrong attitude with your friend with your spouse with a minister with another brother right he will lay a trap he's not concerned how long it takes him to lay the trap he's concerned about the Trap going off and working right he says Satan would get me all worked up and then make me say the wrong thing but the Holy Spirit was there and told me beforehand to be careful what I said all the goodness of God how it was just his mercy be careful what you said this is what I referenced I think last service Saints we it is my goal and my ambition to be a mature Christian to walk in the way of the word to be pleasing to him to be yielded to his spirit and be uh Guided by his spirit and to do things right and I think that we should as the scripture says study to show ourselves approved we we should learn and we should grow and we should be mature but I will never never never come to the place to where I will say Lord I do not need your Supernatural intervention into my life to keep me from doing wrong right the farther along I go The More I Seek that because I realize the insufficiency and the inability for me to be mature enough to always get it right brother Brandon says that Satan had laid this trap to get them all worked up to make him say the wrong thing and the only thing that kept him from that was God coming to him by that little lintu where he had been humiliated years before and telling him there's a trap coming and saying be careful what you say God's supernaturally interjecting himself into his life I welcome that in my life and if that makes me look like an immature Christian and if that makes me look like I don't know a thing and I haven't got anything figured out and I cannot even behave myself accordingly then so be it but I will take him interjecting himself into my life supernaturally and holding my hand like a little baby and guiding me through a situation so that I will come out right rather than trying to figure it out myself and trying to press and do things that's right remember this is a third pull not a third leading myself this is a third pull let him pull us through this process let him pull us through each situation let's not try to figure it out and press our way into it press our way through our daily lives let him pull us through our daily life this situation we're going to listen to this on the tape because we can skim over this so easily and not grasp it but I want it was just really on my heart to actually listen to this situation because brother brandom says Satan would get me all worked up and make me say the wrong thing you when we listen to this you will be able to hear this is something that goes on for prolonged minutes brother brandom is finished preaching he's getting ready to call the prayer line and this is going on for several minutes and you can hear him address it and you can hear the frustration start building the Trap that Satan had laid to get him all worked up so that he would say this is not put on like oh hunky dory I'm here getting ready to call the you all behave yourself now stop it that's not no this is in the this is bearing on him the audience is aware of it the audience is noticing it's distracting from what he's trying to accomplish and he knows that it's grieving to the Holy Spirit and he knows he's got to do something but don't know what to do and it's remember this is Elijah this is the spirit of Elijah in this ministry the spirit of Elijah who would say you know let's build some altars let's see who's God and oh okay your God didn't answer now 400 of you are dead yeah this is Elisha go up old bald head go up all bald head didn't work out too good for him this is the see we can accept all of the good from Elijah and Elisha and this and the spirit that's to be used five times we can accept all of the good but remember the scripture says he was of like P just like me and you are there were things that had to be dealt with in the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Elijah that were wrong but God never quit using that Ministry he would still use that but now something's going to change because where God wants to go that can't go the image that God is wanting to create with a final polishing down that aspect that was in Elijah and an Elisha can't go there anymore it can't be pulled through this filter so it's got to be dealt with so again this is 1958 May the e8th the message is expectations the whole thing is from paragraph 47- 66 we've drastically reduced that for time's sake with the help of brother Franco um I don't have to stand up here with a tape recorder fast forward and play so it's just on my heart I feel that we should listen to this pay very close attention and those listen to the message for sometimes pay attention to his tone of voice pay attention to his voice inflection I think it will do us some good this was not this was not a let me say it this way this was not a controlled situation even though we know God was in control in brother Brandon's shoes this was a real test very fluid situation what we would term in the law enforcement World immediate action required this was not let's sit down have a council figure this out how should we hand what what should do this was a real test we're going to go ahead and play this how many has been here at the previous meetings and seen the working of the Holy Spirit would you just raise your hands so that you thank you how many are here for your first time would you raise your hands and you say I'm here for my first time I very happy to have you tonight in here now I'm saying this before I start to pray for the sick if there would by chance be someone some person who is critical now I'm going to pause this and just make a couple comments here so he's finished his service he's getting ready to call the prayer line This spirit is already at work no doubt this boy and this girl is already either acting something out or the prophet has detected that Spirit there's no doubt about it this is a very uncommon statement for him to make I have to say this according to the law I am not responsible for what happens to them from this point on now if you're here and you would not be reverent I am asking you now when we're singing this hymn and calling the prayer line you may be dismissed if you can stay and be ready R and respectable then we'll be responsible for it in the further part of the meeting the Lord bless you now we call prayer cards now if you can't walk move your hands like this the oers will get you 85 86 87 88 these things are not done in a corner I have last night how many in here witnessed me saying that I've been in prayer on the mountain practically all day far the enemy had set a trap but God will deal with that enemy see it's for told before it comes to pass and you know it was true I suppose lady that you and I are strangers to each other your faith makes you whole sir do you believe it return and give praise to the god of Heaven for your healing that's for well God bless you thank you God bless you God Of Heaven bless you my brother anyway you care to Sir will someone come over here please and over here and watch from the other [Music] side do you believe just have faith out don't doubt have faith [Music] young couple stop that or go out of the building suit yourself the god of heaven will curse you [Music] I do not know you someday we'll stand in the Judgment saints of God that was 1958 60 some plus years ago I am a believer I'm on his side and that still terrifies me this was not plain Church did you notice how long the silence was before he spoke to them I don't know what was going through brother bram's mind but that was a long silence when he says stop it go out of the building suit yourself the god of heaven will curse you he is still in the middle of this test and please I say this with the utmost respect but at this point he is prone to say the wrong thing listen to the tone of his voice listen to the statement that he made there is no mercy in this statement none he has already given the warning and told them if you're going to be disrespectful and irreverent leave the building they've escalated things and now he said these things this was not done in a quarter I warned the audience about this last night there's a trap blade for me God will deal with that enemy yeah right not Mercy in that statement I don't want to speak for the prophet I don't want to say what was in his mind but based on what I know about the English language and voice inflection and tone of voice when he's saying God will deal with that enemy he's not saying God's going to come down and cuddle them they escalate things farther and finally it gets to the point that he stops everything there's this horrendously long uncomfortable silence stop that or get out of the building suit yourself the god of heaven will curse you where is he veering to Saints he's veering the way of Elijah he's veering the way of Elisha he's getting ready to call the she Bears I don't say these things lightly I don't want to put myself in a position that I'm not authority to be in but this I believe this is what the spirit of God is saying this is where he's veering to and then he says that and there's another horrifically long horrifically long uncomfortable silence and he says I don't know who you are but we'll stand in the Judgment together someday see where his mind is going see where his words are going see what he's prone to do [Music] it happened to be that a blessing came to the lady with glasses on there at the brown coat on who suffering there with heart trouble sitting right here looks around do you believe the Lord God will make you well my sister and have what you have asked for if you believe don't now just have faith now pray believe [Music] you are trying to believe sitting there on the end of the seat you walk with a king it's because part of your foot's been taken off that is true I don't know you have never seen you but that's the truth raise up your hand if that's true if you'll believe God with all your heart you can go out without your can in [Music] support what did she touch sitting there what happened what was it rebuked a young couple and blessed a aged woman now young man are you go to miam me young lady you're interfering with the Holy Spirit I'm warning you before it takes place either behave or the Usher will come and see that you can go out for the police one back there now you're in a religious service which is 2 years for disturbing it are you behave not at this time [Music] officer are there any tones of Mercy in those statements he says what would heal this one and rebuke this young couple you can you can hear the detest in his voice and since I'm not saying this in a judgmental way I would have failed the test the first minute I mean I'm just being honest like if I see somebody sleeping in church I don't even have to be preaching and I'm W to call fire down out of heaven like maybe not to consume them but just you know light a little fire under them so I'm not saying this in a judgmental kind of way yeah they would have been packed out of there if I would have been standing there or at the very least the policeman that were there would have already yanked them out of their seats and had them gone oh yeah and I we laugh at that you know but I say that to my embarrassment like I shouldn't be that way that's right that wasn't our example but I'm just being honest like I I I would like to think where I'm at now in the mindset that he's given me now and the Revelation that he's instilled in my heart now now I would you know make it a little longer down the trail before I would be rain and fire and brim stand down I'm I'm not about to say that I would handle it perfect yet I I know by his grace I'll get there but I'm just being honest so when I'm making these statements please you know we're sitting 60 some years away listening to a tape recording we can pause and move and we can judge and see and what this is real to him this is firing off this is happening this is spiritual warfare at its peak with an audience right but because he was so humble and he would come and he would tell us the truth about these things we can properly discern and see and I I feel that he would say the same thing well he did say the same thing he said I would have done wrong if it wasn't for the spirit of God coming on the scene so I'm I'm not saying this in a judgment way I'm just pointing out the fact look where this ship is turning look the road it's getting ready to go down it's it's going there and it's going there hard but now all of a sudden he says you stop it you've already we've already been rebuked you've already been warned you either stop it or the ushers are going to deal with you or the police are going to deal with you but now now something happens and he says not at this time officers why why like you all should be fired for d d elction of Duty you should have dealt with that 5 minutes ago but now he said not at this time officers some something shifted something has [Music] shifted you believe God would heal that stomach trouble for you you're believing that's the reason you stood you're believing now the reason that I told you last night before it come to pass how many was here last night that heard me say Satan has done some evil has set a trap for me and I don't know how to handle it how many remembers that it was a young man and young woman sitting there to curse them they go blind or be paralyzed the hold my peace they live I before it come to pass I'm sparing you hard left turn hard left turn getting ready to call the she Bears getting ready to pronounce judgment getting ready to pronounce a curse and the break Screech God not at this time officers now to you that were in the meeting last night you tell me God didn't come and prick his memory tell me God did not come and supernaturally interject and refresh his memory there was a trap lead for you be careful what you say he declares that to the people and then he says to curse them they'd go blind or paralyzed [Music] if if I hold my peace if I hold my peace they'll live I wasn't there I can't say for certain but I would venture to say this is the part where brother Brandon says that young man was looking at him and his face was white he's recognized I've went too far I've done something that I shouldn't I'm now falling into the hands of a living God he says to curse them that go blind or be paralyzed if I hold my peace they live there's no hesitation there's no long uncomfortable silence he immediately once he recognizes the situation recognizes this was the Trap recognizes I got to be careful what I say if I curse them they'll be paralyzed they'll go blind but if I hold my peace they'll live I'm sparing you immediately immediately moves into Mercy now before it come to pass I'm sparing you there's no hesitation Saints once God pricked his memory prior to that it's a man standing there trying to wrap his mind about how do I handle this what do I do this is a man under frustration how in the world can they be doing that do they not respect God how is this even possible this is so ridiculous frustrated genuinely frustrated already warned them already told them they're going to be cursed of God no effect on them this was not a fake test like he was faking like he really wasn't frustrated this was as real as it gets but I find it astounding as long as it's taking him to work his way through this and again we've cut out minutes of this process as long as it's Tak him to work his way through this and the frustration is building Satan had laid that trap to get him all worked up and it worked he was all worked up but the second the very second that God Pricks his memory do this is what I was talking about and be careful what you say I ventured to say he remembered where he was standing when God told him that and he remembered I'm not even a Woodsman if God wouldn't help me immediately moves into Mercy tells the officers not right now few sentences later immediately moves into Mercy tells them that I'm going to spare you you people believe that God is your not do you that sick bow your heads just a moment for prayer believe you hear with all your heart the Holy Spirit who is near Eternal and blessed God who roared from Mount siia you who spoke through the Apostle Peter and told ananas Andi why did you do this to the Holy Spirit just because his voice spoke one fell dead and the other and was packed out in a little bit you're still God but you're full of mercy and it was foretold to these people before it come to pass that they might know that your servant tells the truth now Eternal God be merciful and Grant tonight that as the enemy sent this young couple in that you'll forgive their sins that they will not be harmed but you will forgive them you come to spare the life of man but the Holy Spirit has Sent His blessings to heal the people just the same Your Grace has overrode it but now the people will know and the young couple knows that I had nothing to do with them coming here but told the night before of their being here now Lord God I pray thee to be merciful to those who are standing who are sick and Afflicted may the great Holy Spirit Come into their hearts just now into their bodies and let them know that the God who lived in the New Testament is alive tonight that it is foretold then comes to pass and all things are done perfect and true through through the Holy Spirit we found it so and we love you Lord Jesus because that you have loved us and has washed us in your blood and has made us your children thank you Father for these things and we now rebuke the devil of sickness from the people that he'll depart from them and they may all be made well in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all that believe and accept your healing from God stand to your feet just now as you except without one Shadow of Doubt feeling in your heart that God has healed you how you ought to give thanks to God the Bible said when something like this taken place in the Bible time there was fear fell on all the people throughout all the regions what do you think tonight I say praise the Lord I say praise the Lord for his overriding grace and mercy because without that with without that he would have went down the wrong road without that they would have been cursed now I just want you to think for a second remember God is bringing the prophet through a process and he's bringing him to this point he's brought he's pulling on him with this scripture of Mark 11 he's already seen it manifest that I have the power of God in my tongue when he tells me to speak and say something that's the way it'll be he gave that fish his life back he knows see it wouldn't have been a real test if he wouldn't have truly known what I say is going to come to pass so God had to demonstrate to him beforehand you really do have this power yeah you understand what I'm saying it's it's not a bluff yeah right it can only be a real test if he knows I can handle this and deal with this and when he's told me CU he the the Holy Spirit has told him whatever you say right yeah that's the way it'll be and he knows that'll work right so this is a real test it's not well you know I'll deal with it this way cuz I don't know if it will you know really happen if I say it oh no he knows but I want you to think of this God's been molding his character through the incidents that he suffered with losing his wife and his baby by not listening to God's voice and going out the first time multiple other things just even his childhood how this man was broken comes up to he's got one last thread of decency and manhood about him that I'm still a pretty good Woodsman and God snatches that away from him and now he's standing in a position that God Almighty has says whatever you speak to these people that's the way it'll be there's people that have forgotten that he forgave these two people how many people even the naysayers of brother brandom's message even in that time how many people do you think would have forgot if there was a man that was standing behind the pull pit and two people were being disrespectful and he says I curse you and you shall die and they'll pack you out and it happened yeah right think of The credibility that that gives to your ministry Peter did it one time and it's written in the word of God and it says the whole region roundabout said I ain't going to church there no no no they don't play Church there you see what God had to strip from him before he even got to this point amen and you see the truth humility where he's at no doubt he had people chirping on his shoulders oh it's mind reading it's this it's this was a real man in real life going through real struggles and real people attacking his ministry and now he's got a chance to as they say to Silence the Critics I think people nowadays would be a lot less likely to say anything wrong against his ministry had he said they'll pack you out of here because you got a whole audience full of people hundreds of people no doubt there's nobody going to dispute this like you can say I forgive you okay y where's the manifestation where's the manifestation you say they'll pack you out of here you don't have to wonder where the manifestation is at you don't have to wonder whether he was faking it you don't have to wonder where whether he was telling the truth but now here's a man in the proper character in the proper position that he's not going to worry about sealing his credibility of his ministry he's more concerned about God finishing the polishing on him he's not concerned about spreading his influence outside of this situation he's dealing with he's not concerned about his worldwide Ministry and his ministry and that influence and how he may be looked at as a bishop well that's Bishop number one of pronounce you dead if you disrespect me in the meetings right he's not looking for that title he's standing there he says trembling sweating praying to God what do I say and how do I handle this right yes amen this is a man that's been on Hurricane Mountain yeah and knew that he needed mercy and he didn't forget that you see the process and the years that God Drew him through to get to this point release the power of the spoken word to heal the fish to let him know that it was true it was accurate pulling on him with this Mark 11 scripture and now now there's just one small problem and this problem was approximately 2900 years ago a problem one problem 2900 years ago that God has to deal with before he can move into the third pole the final pole and that problem was a prophet who got angry and said what he wanted to say instead of what God wanted to say yes you say well you know whatever 2900 years that's just three days to God of course he would remember that seriously 2900 years ago a flaw in the spirit of Elijah's character and God says I have got to deal with that because this ministry this man this vessel is the vessel that I'm literally going to step into as the lamb and pull the seals off of the book and I cannot understand what I'm saying God's not taking a chance but I cannot take a chance that when I put the power of the spoken word the the creative spoken word on his tongue that he will even interject himself slightly I've got to deal with this one I know it was 2900 years ago but I've got to make sure that's not going to rise up at the inopportune time I'm going to make a really drastic statement not Doctrine but I'm going to go here to 19 58 May the e8th paragraph 63 how fetting 63 and he says now before it comes to pass I'm sparing you may the 8th 1958 paragraph 63 is literally the hinging point of whether the lamb can come and break the seals or not it's the hinging point because if he doesn't pass this test the lamb cannot step into this vessel what if he comes to the first seal and says well I don't know what it is but I think it's right we're done me and you would not be sitting here if he comes to these seals being loose and he and he doesn't know for certainty that I have to to wait for God himself to come and speak this word out of me if I can interject anything of me into this me and you are doomed we cannot come into the full image of Christ amen and remember the seals were just not the interpretation of the symbols the seals were the release of the spirit of God to us it was the full not a partial dip but this this was the fullness of the spirit of God they asked brother random the question now that this has been released could you come and speak the word over somebody and instantly put them into rapturing condition and he says yes that's right amen amen what has he done to us Saints has not the word that he has came and spoken over top of us put us into rapturing condition that would have never happened happened if he would have said anything else in paragraph 63 this was the liftoff point because now God has rectified and it wasn't to say that brother brandham didn't have issues coming up in his life that he made mistakes and God had to deal with him but we're talking about a issue that was 2900 years ago in the spirit of Elijah that God is wanting to use to fulfill his Ministry he's got to root that out of there he's got to expose that and he's got to get that out of there to go where he wants to go and the test was real just like mine and your test is real it wasn't a fake test it wasn't an easy test for the prophet and we're coming to a close if you'll just bear with me for a couple more minutes but this is the main thing that I wanted to present to you brother Rand says it's just the way you say things sometimes that changes everything how many in here would agree that the prophet had the literal power of the spoken word reinstated to his tongue but what about Revelation 108 what do we have on our tongue if we're saying what he said what do we have the issue is not whether we have it or not yes we've got it amen the issue is how are we going to say it are we going to skip over the son of man Ministry who was sent to the world to save lives and go right to the white Throne judgment if you don't believe this you're doomed you're dead you're going to hell you don't see it my way you don't stand a chance are we going to skip over that that's what a young John did that's what a Young Bride did yes right somebody raised up in contention to him well I'll just call fire down out of Heaven I'll fix your problem yes brother R says A young John did that I don't want to be a young John amen I want to be a mature John I want to be a John that's been to the a of patmas I want to be a John that's been to Hurricane Mountain to realize without him I can't even walk properly I want to be a a a mature John who's not flippant with my tongue I just ask you this question Saints we would agree that at this juncture in time May the eth 1957 paragraph 63 There was a lot hinging on what came out of that man's mouth why do we think we're any different yes we're in the closing moments of time if God would deal with something 2900 years ago before he would move on to into a third poll with his Prophet how do we think we're going to get by with making flippant statements that's based on our pride just little statement here a little statement there protecting oursel here protecting our reputation there saying something will make me just to look a little bit better little more spiritual if God didn't wink at it for 2900 years and came back and dealt with it do we think he's going to give us a pass if we've got a speck of it laying in our heart no he's going to come and deal with it amen because the image that he has saw is a perfect image without spot without wrinkle and he is not a man that should lie yeah it's going to be as he said so I wanted to play that and I hope you could grasp that and I feel that you caught when he went into prayer do you hear the tone of his voice change this is a fearful thing Saints this was not a man playing around this was a man speaking in place of God totally changed his voice structure as you roared from Mount Si but he moves into mercy and over in this short prayer over and over again he says be merciful to them he doesn't just spare them one time now he comes and starts interceding for them that's Lord once again be merciful to them don't let them be harmed don't let them be touched be merciful thank you for your writing Grace be merciful to them amen not just once but once he caught it once he knew where he was at once he recognized the test once he knew what needed to be done once he knew I got to be careful what I say then when he lays on Mercy he lays it on thick prise why because he'd been to Hurricane Mountain and he knew that without Mercy in his life he never stood a chance am and now he knows that I'm just going to extend as much Mercy as I needed see once you have yourself readjusted once you have a proper standard once you recognize that you're nothing but 87 cents worth of dust it's easy to have mercy you know the problem the only problem with having grace and mercy for somebody is if you think of yourself a little more highly than you ought to amen cuz the only reason you wouldn't extend grace and mercy to somebody is if you think they don't deserve it and the only way that you can come to that conclusion is if you've already lifted yourself up into some type of position that you don't belong in as a judge so the way and why would you do that if it wasn't based on Pride amen but we've had a wave sheath come to demonstrate to us where we're to come to we don't live in the Days of Elijah anymore the actual man Elijah we don't live in the days of Elisha anymore we're calling the she Bears out is okay but as Jesus said why was the son of man sent to Earth Saints why was this message the person of this message sent to Earth to save life to save me and you you say well yeah but it's going to condemn all the den it's going to condemn all that's on them that wasn't the purpose that the scripture says that they condemn themselves cuz they believe not you know light came into the world and they they walked in darkness that's on them that wasn't the purpose amen the purpose of him coming was to give us life amen what should our purpose be yeah what should our purpose be to our brothers and sisters to other assemblies to the people we associate with and work what should our motivation be and again as our pastor taught us a couple Services ago this is not a wishy-washy oh I can't say anything to offend anybody no this is a sheep being led by the dove yes that's right if there need fire called down out of Heaven call it down but don't be sitting in a seat of judgment thinking there ought to be fire called down out of Heaven that's the problem remember where you were at maybe in a worse situation than what this person is that you're wanting to judge them for because you've been walking in the message for a couple years remember where you came from remember I'm preaching at you again I'm preaching and really preaching at me remember where I came from when I needed some help when I needed some Grace when I needed some mercy now there were people and Ministries in my life that came and called some fire and brimstone down on me and I needed it I was deserving of it there were things that needed to be said to prick my heart there's nothing wrong with saying something to prick somebody's heart or to expose to them that they're wrong it's how you do it that matters let's not act out of Pride let's not act out of arrogance because we've got the truth we're message Believers we know we know who the prophet is you're a heathen you don't even know God sent a prophet well did you come out of the womb knowing God sent a prophet I mean there was probably one day that somebody told you that God sent a prophet and he had some truth that you hadn't heard about I'm I'm not trying to come off too hard on that Saints it's just I'm really really frustrated at myself that somehow from 16 15 16 years of age to 39 years of age I lost that so if you pick up on frustration or hardness it's not towards you it's towards me like how as the scripture says how do we take the Beau this beautiful Revelation and come to a wrong conclusion with it how do we start out in pure humility and somehow come 20 some years later and we've lost that yes where did it go what happened that's not acceptable so it's not hardness towards you it's it's hardness towards me I want to read just a couple scriptures and then we're going to close if the musician would come 2 Kings 2:23 this is about Elisha and he went up from then un bethl and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou Baldhead go up thou Baldhead these were children who were referencing the Rapture of Elijah oh you're following Elijah well go on up old Wellhead go on uphead like Elisha could been like well I'm not angry even for myself they're insulting my prophet he could have so I don't know how he justified it but he may have had in his mind justification for doing this well I'm not upset about myself I don't care what they say about my reputation I am bald you know who cares but you know you're making fun of Elijah my Prophet Elijah who was raptured well come on she Bears see there's so many ways that a man can reason these things away but ultimately at the end of the day the voice is going to come walking in the garden it's going to reveal to us that we're naked even though we think we're clothed yes it's going to stick us up on a mountain somewhere where we thought we was a good Woodsman and configure a way around and realize you know what I don't stand a chance here I'm lost I need some help brother random says this was not the will of God for Elisha to do this he says it was an angry prophet the other scripture that he referenced was Luke 9:46 then there arose arose a reasoning among them um which of them should be the greatest so this is the disciples walking along and this is their mindset that they're in which of us is the greatest and Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and said to them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great this is the mindset the disciples were in and Jesus perceives it in his heart and tries to correct it and John answered and said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbid him because he followed not with us I don't think he caught it I don't think I don't think Young John got the message Jesus said forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem and sent Messengers before his face and they entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem and when his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord wil thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias did but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit year of for the son of man is not come to destroy men's life but to save them here is James and John saying we're going to call down fire out of heaven and destroy you unbelievers but I want you to back up two polls the first poll was they were reasoning among themselves which of them should be the greatest they didn't repent of that even when Jesus exposed it so they moved into a second poll and said these people are using the power of God and they're not even part of our group we told them stop it we all laugh at that I mean that's ludicrous but this is their mindset right which of us is the greatest oh look at them what what stop it you're not even you're not even part of us Jesus comes and says forbid them not if they're not against us they're clearly for us yeah amen but look at the final stage because of a lack of repentance because of a lack of recognizing we should not be reasoning among oursel who is the greatest and we should be humbling ourselves as a little child just be grateful that we're in the kingdom of God because we failed to do that now we're going to shut down any believers that's not part of our group and somebody that doesn't agree with us and make us welcome and comfortable all the time we'll just call fire down out of Heaven to destroy them that's where the pride of life will take you CU if it wasn't for the pride of life they would have never been having a conversation of who is the greatest Among Us couple quotes and we'll go to close in the reproach for the cause of the word brother brandom says there is nothing happens just accidentally to those who love the Lord and are called according to his calling we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie and he said that was so and everything has its time its season and its way and God is behind every move and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong it's up to us those things are put Upon Us trials and wonderings it's testing to see how we will react on an action how many has ever been a place in your life that you think everything is going wrong it's testing to see how we will react to that action we say well why do I need to be tested why do the prophet need to be tested amen why do you need to be tested is because God is going to do the same thing that he did to the prophet and he is literally going to put the power of the spoken word on your tongue am he has literally put the power of the spoken of word in our daily lives we don't need to be sitting around waiting on some Supernatural anointing and mega manifestation of speaking things into existence why don't we start speaking the word into existence in our own life why don't we let that have an effect on the people around us but you can never project the right word to the people you associate with is if you don't have the right word in you already and you can never get the right word in you already if you're not first tested to make sure you're not going to go the direction you're prone to go as a hybrid individual amen he said some time ago up in Vermont so this is in 1962 right before the seals open brother brandom comes back and reiterates this story about this young couple this is how important this is and I promise I'm going to close right after this but he says a couple different things in here that just really pop out he says in the reproach for the word this is December of 62 so s what time is this is happening he's getting ready to go west he's getting ready to come back with the seals and he's saying that everything happens in our life at a time and a season for a purpose and a reason and God has to do things in our life to test and see how we're going to react and then he moves immediately into this story some time ago up in Vermont brother Fred and I were up there in the mountains where we were up on Hurricane Mountain where I used to hunt and there I remembered when I was lost this was when he had the Vermont meetings he said when he took brother Fred back up there I remembered that I was up there lost one day and how that God LED me back just by the Holy Spirit alone through a storm that I would have died perished and so would have my wife and Billy down in a little Camp miles away and I was turned around and I was standing there talking to brother Fred and the Holy Spirit said get out to yourself and I moved out into the bush a little a little place and he told me there's a trap set for you be careful now but he didn't tell me how or what I came back and told Brother Fred we went to church that night in the auditorium announced it to the people and the next night it happened and then standing there when he told me upon some mockers he said it's in your hands do with them whatsoever you say it will happen right now there you are where somebody irreverent ungodly and they were making fun and scoffing at the meeting and a young man and a young woman and he was trying to vulger love make with her in the building in everybody's attention while I was trying to preach and pull her head back and climb up in her lap and throw her head back and try to kiss her and going old like that in the meeting drawing the attention and the Holy Spirit says they are in your hands what will you do with them there was a holy hush we just listen to this holy hush everybody sat deathly quiet and I thought oh God what must I do then I remembered if it hadn't been for the warning of the Holy Spirit two days before that and I said I'll forgive you now that was what he wanted me to say because after all this is the Revelation that comes to him now because after all I had been guilty maybe not of that but guilty and guilty of the least is guilty of whole right this is the mindset brother Brandon was in when he's able to express Mercy how was he able to come to the conclusion I need to express Mercy because he remembered I'm guilty too maybe not of that but I've been guilty before and he that's guilty of least is guilty at whole and I sure want Mercy in my life so I'm going to express Mercy amen he says so I said I forgive you now you see I believe that all these things had a meaning what would you do with power how would you see the reaction of an action something that has come as an act then how do you react to that action do you understand what I mean what would you do and maybe all of this all of this testing this whole situation he comes to the end of 1962 in December right before the seals come and he says and maybe all of this has worked up to where we're at right now I would say that's an accurate assessment everything that you have experienced to mold and to shape your character for God himself to come down and indwell a human being and express the fullness of his word with the fullness of his character and the fullness of his power on a mortal hybrid tongue I would say all of this has worked to that point and remember he started that out by saying nothing happens by chance everything's predestinated everything's right on time and God does these things for a reason so Saints as we would stand together I would just encourage you we live in a horrific horrific worldly age pressures on every side things are not going to slow down things are going to speed up things are going to get more difficult things are going to get more confusing how to handle situations are going to get more difficult yes but I wonder if the testings that we've went through before this has not molded us and shaped us to a point that we can approach them correctly now and realize I don't need to press and try to figure this out what I need to do is be more powerful than he that rules the city shut my mouth it's kind of hard to preach like this shut my mouth and let God tell me what to say am how and I'm not just saying verbally it may you may not say anything and handle a situation physically or the way you conduct yourself you may not verbalize anything but it's still the power of the spoken word in your life right amen amen I would say that's what's brought us to this point and we need to take confidence in that we need to take confidence and he that started this work can finish this work even if it requires a little bit of final polishing this power that has been given to us I find it amazing the statements that brother Brandon makes even within days of this anointing coming to him look at his mindset same message speak to this mountain he says and I would ask thee Lord may it not be thought by the people because I'm referring to an experience that you have given me and telling the truth Lord may it not be thought that it was meant personally but that you were fixing but what you were fixing to do for all of your people here's a man who's manifested the spoken word and he's already got the mindset Lord I'm going to relay this to the people but don't let them think I'm trying to Puff myself up this is not even directly for me this is for all the people let them grasp that look look how easy it would have went could have went the other way look how men are prone to go the other way you give how many examples have we seen of a man with just a little bit of a gift build a major platform and here's a man with a real gift a major gift and he's immediately saying I'm going to express this but don't you all think anything of me this is for everybody amen at the closing prayer he says we repent of our sins Lord forgive me of all my mistakes forgive my ministering brother for their mistakes forgive the Church of their mistakes Lord God sanctify our heart so deeply with love and power and with consecration find favor with us Lord pour out your power we would not do anything wrong I believe every man in here would have made the same thing that night when it was given to speak evil to that boy brother brandom is not even trying to reserve this gift to himself he's wanting it to go in if you listen to this message he's wanting every Minister there on the platform to experience of this and have use of this and he's saying Lord I'm interceding for them they won't do anything wrong Lord they wouldn't do anything wrong if they were in that same test that I was they would have spoke Mercy to those boy that boy and that girl Lord I know they would have what humility what humility a man that's now standing in a position that Jesus Christ stood a man who could actually make himself a reputation remember Jesus was the only one that came who actually could have made himself of a reputation and deserved it and now here's a man even though he's born in sin shaped in iniquity been converted now God has released this power to him think of the ministry and the platform and the reputation he could have built you say oh no God wouldn't Hey listen God allowed them she Bears to come out of the Wilderness yes sir absolutely the prophet was acting wrong and doing not what God wanted done and God still had to honor the office and the gift don't tell me it wouldn't have worked I would I have no capacity to believe Within Myself that if he would have said those people would have died that they would not have died it would have worked but he is so reversed course from what human beings are prone to do and now he's not only interceding for himself but he's interceding for the whole church he's inter interceding for all the ministry and saying Lord I've I know they want to do what's right they will speak mercy and grace to the people if you will just release this to us questions and answers 1959 he says God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God calls him to do something you believe that he says as soon as man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a God he wants to become an angel he wants to become s some great person what I do me and me and mine all that he says that's the wrong ad attitude God's hunting for somebody who could be blessed and pour out the blessing and the more He blesses the little the man will become I say that's the age we've come to Saints we've we've been given a proper word with a proper understanding with the proper character behind it to do what brother Rand says what does the son of man Ministry come for to reproduce the son of man ministry again there was a reason we were giving this and that reason is so that we can humble ourselves so that he can do what he wants to do and that we will hum humble ourselves the first step is humility the final polishing is with humility 1 Corinthians 2:1 you don't have to turn there I'm just going to quote it Paul speaking and he says and I Brethren when I came to you I came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determine not to know anything among you saved Jesus Christ but he doesn't stop there and him crucified Paul says the first church change messenger the foundation layer says there should not be any any it's pretty broad word anything known among you except for Christ and not just Christ but more specifically him crucified that's what the first church age messenger said the foundation layer if we want to be successful with God we're not going to be able to build upon any other Foundation Christ crucified in our lives crucify ourselves to manifest what he wants as our pastor would come Revelation 1:1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John I read this scripture last time but remember there's only one appropriate response to what happens between verse 1 and verse 17 in the Book of Revelation chapter 1 there's only one appropriate response God comes through his servant and pours out his entire Revelation to his bride and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead that's the only appropriate response to this message that we've been given this message did not come to Puff us up it did not come to make us think that we're even a little bit better than somebody else this message came to make us have a proper understanding that I am wrong and he is right and I'm going to lay myself at his feet because I'm a dead man and then I'm going to allow him because remember it doesn't stop there he comes and he puts his hand on us and he says fear not I am the first and I am the last what's the first and the last the polishing fear not I know I know this Revelation that you've come to has made you realize you don't stand a chance and that you're hopeless and not worthy I know I get it but remember I'm the first one that came to you and make you realize that and now that I've completely revealed myself to you I'm the last one who's just going to polish you up a little bit with humility and it's going to be okay you you are going to manifest and do what I've called you to do amen because you've come to a proper Revelation let's pray together precious Lord Jesus we just want to thank you for this time that you've given us Lord father we have no words to express our gratefulness to you that you would love us so much to not only send your word to us Lord but you would love us so much to send us a prophet of like passions that we are and put his entire life on public display for us Lord the good and the bad Lord if you would not have done that we would have not have stood a chance there is no way that we could have grasp there is no way we could have grasped what you were doing there is no way we could have had hope or believed that you could do it in us but Lord you were gracious enough not only to do it but to give us a wave sheef Lord to give us an example to give us a man who was so honest that he would that he would come and reveal where he aired and where he went wrong and what he should have done and how he made it right Lord you revealed It All To Us father and to we thank you that that man did not have to stand there by himself in 1958 when a hinging point of his ministry for the fullness of the word to come in to effect was at stake that you wouldn't leave him there helpless Lord but you would come and you would prick his memory this is what I spoke to you about make sure you handle it correctly Lord so that he could come and reverse what was done wrong 2900 years ago Lord and that you could pick up that vessel and complete your ministry and complete your work in it so that we could come to Perfection Lord you've done all of that for us Lord and we are Beyond grateful for that may we truly comprehend it may we truly recognize it may we not take it for granted but may we humble ourselves and as you have exposed these things and you have revealed the real standard may we come and may we tow up to the line Lord and may we be honest with ourselves may we be honest with you may we be honest with our brothers and sisters Lord we just commit ourselves to you Lord thanking you

myself and the trappings of life and I want one thing I learned today is that there's been a trap laid for us would you agree there's a trap laid for you be careful what you say it's a message I want to take away from today that that in all kinds of circumstances in life the devil's trying to bring me out of my position and try and get me to use my mouth for the wrong thing and trying to get me to act in Pride and and there's not just one trap there's all kinds of traps laid for us friends I want to remember from now on I want to be careful what I say I want to be careful how I act I want to act in the same nature of the word that's been given to us I want to be a display of the word in everything and I know you do too amen I don't know about you but I just feel like I want to surrender all over again and say God I'm so thankful for what you did and forgive me forever getting puffed up in my own thinking but help me to stay humble I think it's beautiful that we have an opportunity to come and take communion this afternoon we're going to have communion this afternoon we're going to come back for communion and feet washing at 4: Lord willing and what a reminder of the Salvation that we all needed and what God had to pay the price had to be paid because we were wrong and unable to save ourselves and we needed to save you it's a good reminder may God bless you as you go may the
