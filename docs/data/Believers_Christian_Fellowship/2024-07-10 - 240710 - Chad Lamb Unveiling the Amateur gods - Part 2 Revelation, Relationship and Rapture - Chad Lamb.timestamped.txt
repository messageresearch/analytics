[11:43] me amen God bless you this evening let's
[11:47] bow our heads
[11:49] together Heavenly Father we thank you
[11:51] Lord once again for the privilege of
[11:54] being here God for your call and for
[11:57] your draw Lord as you draw us to
[12:00] yourself God I pray that you would take
[12:02] control this evening Lord that you would
[12:04] take this vessel of mine under your
[12:06] control that you would take these vocal
[12:08] cords Lord under your Supreme control
[12:11] and use them to speak your words of
[12:13] eternal life God may you give us all
[12:15] ears to hear and a heart to perceive all
[12:18] that you're speaking to us in this day
[12:20] may we yield and surrender ourselves to
[12:22] you in a greater way and that you might
[12:24] have the preeminence you desire God
[12:27] we're looking to you and trusting in you
[12:28] and asking for you to come and do what
[12:31] only you can do that you might break the
[12:33] bread of life for us and Feed Us by your
[12:36] own hand we give you glory for this in
[12:39] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[12:42] amen and God bless you all and while
[12:45] we're standing this evening why don't we
[12:47] take our Bibles together and if we could
[12:50] turn to the Book of John and the gospels
[12:54] Gospel of
[12:55] John chapter 10
[13:03] I'm going to uh continue on with the
[13:05] thought from Sunday and this would be
[13:07] part two and uh unveiling the amateur
[13:10] Gods part two and we just pray that God
[13:13] will have his way there's several
[13:15] thoughts I have along with this thought
[13:17] things that I want to bring out and
[13:19] share so I just pray that God will have
[13:21] his way with me and then bring what he
[13:23] wants out and it may take a few services
[13:25] but praise the lord we would enjoy that
[13:27] amen enjoy en Joy hearing his word John
[13:34] 10:34 and Jesus says in verse 34 Jesus
[13:38] answered them is it not written in your
[13:40] law I said ye are gods for he called
[13:43] them Gods un unto whom the word of God
[13:46] came and the scriptures cannot be broken
[13:50] say ye of him whom the father has
[13:51] Sanctified and sent into the world thou
[13:53] blasphemist because I say I am the Son
[13:56] of God Amen God bless you as you have
[13:59] your seats so here we know in the
[14:02] scriptures the scripture says in Psalms
[14:05] he was referring to Psalms here we read
[14:07] it last time where he says and ye are
[14:09] gods and you are children of the most
[14:11] high and he says is it not written in
[14:14] your law I said you are Gods so then
[14:17] Jesus is now saying if you call them
[14:19] Gods un whom the word of God came and
[14:22] the scriptures can't be broken then how
[14:24] how come you're condemning me cuz I say
[14:25] I'm the Son of God so we know that
[14:27] they're called Gods to whom the word of
[14:29] the Lord came Amen to the whom the word
[14:31] of God came and also the scripture just
[14:33] calls the children of God Gods amen and
[14:36] so when we talk about uh amateur Gods uh
[14:40] brother B uses this term over and over
[14:42] we would never be using this term if it
[14:44] wasn't for a prophet of God who came in
[14:46] this day and begin to show us there's
[14:48] minor Gods amateur Gods messes he he
[14:51] began to teach this principle and show
[14:53] us what our position is in the end time
[14:56] and so he came to take the veil off toak
[14:59] break the spiritual Amnesia to bring us
[15:01] back to what God always intended for his
[15:03] children to be sin had separated us from
[15:06] God's original intention and plan by
[15:08] bringing by by bringing his family to
[15:10] manifestation upon the Earth God had a
[15:12] plan he had a vision for that and sin
[15:15] came and interrupted that Vision amen
[15:17] but the restoration of the word through
[15:18] the Redemption of Jesus Christ now the
[15:20] Redemption cycle is going to bring us
[15:22] back to God's vision of what he wanted
[15:25] with his children upon the Earth he
[15:27] wanted Sons and Daughters of God and
[15:29] those Sons and Daughters of God are
[15:31] offspring of God so offspring of God can
[15:34] be nothing else than God's praise God
[15:37] Amen so that's where we get this term
[15:40] amen so when we look at this term we're
[15:43] we're looking at uh uh it's it's God
[15:48] Amen in a minor way or God revealing
[15:51] himself through flesh in a minor way
[15:54] amen not not in full measure he did that
[15:56] in Jesus Christ but God EX displaying
[15:59] attributes displaying himself in human
[16:01] flesh now let's go to Hebrews chap 11
[16:06] and we're going to do just a real quick
[16:07] touch on a review of what we went
[16:10] through
[16:11] on uh Sunday and I just want to touch a
[16:14] couple things here and then move on
[16:16] Hebrews
[16:19] 11:1 says now Faith is the substance of
[16:24] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[16:26] Not Seen for by it the elders obtain Ain
[16:29] a good report through faith we
[16:31] understand that the worlds were framed
[16:32] by the word of God so that the things
[16:34] which are seen were not made of things
[16:36] which do appear and brother brandham
[16:38] picked this up and he says now how did
[16:40] God make the Earth this Earth that
[16:42] you're sitting on this morning people
[16:44] don't want to believe in faith how did
[16:46] God make the Earth he spoke it amen you
[16:48] see he spoke and the world came into
[16:51] existence in this world this morning is
[16:53] the spoken word of God and he believed
[16:56] his own word amen so now have a a
[16:59] principle of God that God Amen speaks
[17:02] his word but God also believes his own
[17:05] word and when God believes his word his
[17:07] word comes into manifestation so if
[17:10] that's what the major God or The God or
[17:12] God original does what should the
[17:15] amateur gods do amen they should be in
[17:17] the same image as their father
[17:20] amen he says he goes on in the same
[17:23] quote here it is watch it and if God and
[17:25] you're offspring of him and God is in
[17:27] you you'll believe his own word or he'll
[17:31] believe his own word though it can't be
[17:33] seen felt taste or anything he'll
[17:36] believe it see what I mean for God in
[17:39] you will believe his own
[17:41] word this is what it means to be an
[17:44] amateur God or a minor God Amen it it it
[17:47] has to start with faith but what kind of
[17:49] Faith amen it cannot be intellectual
[17:52] Faith or even human Faith but it's got
[17:54] to be the Seed Faith Of God that's down
[17:56] on the inside that's been quickened by
[17:58] the spirit of of God that can believe
[18:00] the word of God amen amen just like the
[18:03] father
[18:05] amen now let's look at Hebrews uh
[18:09] 11:6 says but without faith it is
[18:11] impossible to please him for he that
[18:15] cometh to God must believe that he is
[18:17] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[18:19] diligently seek him so without faith it
[18:22] is impossible to please him I love that
[18:24] statement that's actually a huge
[18:26] statement and this is what is the death
[18:28] nail to religion amen cuz so many people
[18:30] are trying to appease please or appease
[18:34] or gain something from God through
[18:36] religious means or through ritualistic
[18:38] worship or through legalism amen but
[18:41] that's not what pleases God what pleases
[18:43] God is Faith amen amen and and Faith
[18:48] expressed is obedience to the word of
[18:51] God absolutely because if you believe
[18:53] the word of God Amen you will line up to
[18:55] the word of God you will obey the word
[18:57] of God Jesus said if you love me keep my
[18:59] Commandments amen this is a this is
[19:01] fundamental principle theme if you
[19:03] believe the word you will surrender to
[19:05] the word you will obbey the word you
[19:07] will manifest the word amen but the core
[19:11] of it is
[19:13] Faith amen without faith it is
[19:16] impossible to please him again brother B
[19:20] says he just spoke it and it turned into
[19:22] existence speaking of God now he
[19:25] believed in his own word and if a man's
[19:27] born of the spirit of God he's an
[19:29] offspring of God and that part of God is
[19:31] in him and he believes every word that
[19:33] God says will
[19:36] materialize and and so that makes him
[19:38] part of God the holy spirit in the man
[19:40] makes him part of God Amen so The
[19:44] Offspring of God the children of God
[19:46] believe like God God believed that his
[19:48] word would materialize amen and The
[19:50] Offspring of God believed that God's
[19:52] word will materialize all of it will
[19:54] materialize
[19:56] amen praise God
[19:59] Jesus makes this statement in Luke 18
[20:01] I'll just quote it to you it says Luke
[20:03] 188 I tell you that uh he will avenge
[20:06] him speedily nevertheless when the son
[20:08] of man cometh shall he find faith on the
[20:11] earth the question is what was he
[20:13] looking
[20:13] for Faith amen it wasn't looking for a
[20:17] religious system because when the son of
[20:19] man come the first time amen there was a
[20:21] religious system there was there was a
[20:23] whole order of religion and they had
[20:25] taken the word that Moses gave them in
[20:27] the law and they had formed a whole
[20:28] order and a structure and it had
[20:30] everything amen but that wasn't what he
[20:32] was looking for he was looking for Faith
[20:34] amen amen when he returned this day
[20:36] what's he looking for he's looking for
[20:38] Faith praise God let's look at John 18
[20:53] now now we're
[20:55] saved by grace through faith and that
[20:58] not of yourselves is a gift of
[21:01] God the ability to believe is a gift of
[21:06] God John
[21:10] 18:33 then pilate entered into the
[21:12] Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and
[21:14] said unto him art thou the king of the
[21:17] Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this
[21:20] thing of thyself or did others tell it
[21:22] thee of me pilate answered I am I a Jew
[21:26] thine own nation and thy Chief priest
[21:28] have delivered thee unto me what hast
[21:30] thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is
[21:33] not of this world if my kingdom were of
[21:35] this world then would my servants fight
[21:37] that I should not be delivered to the
[21:39] Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[21:41] hence pilate therefore said unto him art
[21:44] thou a king then Jesus answered thou
[21:47] sayest that I am a
[21:49] king then listen to this statement to
[21:52] this end was I born and for this cause
[21:55] came I into the into the world that I
[21:58] should bear witness unto the truth so
[22:01] what was his
[22:02] purpose let's read it again to this end
[22:05] was I born for this reason was I
[22:08] born and for this cause came I into the
[22:10] world that I should bear witness unto
[22:13] the truth everyone that is of the truth
[22:16] heareth my
[22:17] voice so what was the purpose of Jesus
[22:21] coming into the Earth of being born in
[22:23] flesh in the earth to Bear witness of
[22:25] the truth because he was the truth he
[22:27] was the truth the way and the life amen
[22:29] he was the manifestation he was the full
[22:31] measure of the manifestation of the
[22:33] thought of God in flesh he was God in
[22:36] flesh he was the word made flesh he was
[22:38] the fullness of the godhead in flesh he
[22:40] was the truth fleshed
[22:42] out and for this end was he
[22:45] born and for this cause came he into the
[22:48] world that he should bear witness of the
[22:50] truth everyone that is of the truth
[22:52] heareth my voice amen now if that was
[22:56] his purpose for being manifested than
[22:58] the earth what should our purpose as
[23:01] amateur Gods be in being manifest upon
[23:03] the Earth but we should be here to Bear
[23:05] witness of the truth if that's what God
[23:08] did when he came in the flesh amen he
[23:11] his purpose was to Bear witness of the
[23:13] truth when God comes into our flesh amen
[23:16] what were we born why are we here why
[23:18] are we born again what is God trying to
[23:20] do with us I believe our purpose in this
[23:22] end time is to Bear witness of the truth
[23:26] as amateur Gods amen he was there to
[23:29] subject himself to the will of the
[23:31] father to obey the word amen we are here
[23:33] to be Witnesses of the truth to do the
[23:35] same thing subject ourselves to our
[23:37] bridegroom bear witness of the
[23:40] word amen let's go
[23:43] back to John chapter
[23:46] 8 now we're still just
[23:49] reviewing John chapter 8 verse
[23:53] 46 John
[23:56] 846 which of you convince me of
[23:59] sin and if I say the truth why do you
[24:02] not believe me he that is of God heareth
[24:06] God's words you therefore hear them not
[24:09] because you are not of
[24:11] God Jesus makes it so
[24:14] simple mean it it can get so complicated
[24:18] when we go into the religious Realms and
[24:21] this is right and that's not right and
[24:22] this is the rule we didn't follow the
[24:23] rule but this one believes it isn't I
[24:25] mean forget all of that amen Jesus cuts
[24:28] down to the chase amen you're you're if
[24:30] you're of God you believe God's word if
[24:32] you're not of God you don't believe
[24:33] God's
[24:35] word amen and Jesus was testifying of
[24:38] the word of God he was bearing witness
[24:40] of the truth so that when they were
[24:41] rejecting him he knew that they were
[24:43] rejecting the word they were rejecting
[24:45] God they were they were not of God John
[24:48] chapter 6 let's go back just a couple
[24:50] chapters John chapter 6 verse
[24:54] 28 trying to keep moving because this is
[24:57] review amen I want to move to the next
[24:59] part John 6:28 then said they unto him
[25:03] what shall we do that we might work the
[25:06] works of God now here they want to know
[25:09] what is the The Works what can I do to
[25:12] please God what what is the works to do
[25:15] the works of God I want to know give me
[25:17] the list of things that I need to
[25:20] do what can we do to do the works of God
[25:23] Jesus answered and said unto them this
[25:25] is the work of God that ye Believe on on
[25:28] him who he hath
[25:31] sent praise be to God why because God in
[25:34] every age and every dispensation has
[25:37] sent a voice into the Earth a
[25:39] representative that could catch his
[25:40] thought for that day and bring it to the
[25:43] people he did it through prophets he did
[25:44] it he did it in the church ages through
[25:47] through the messengers of each age God
[25:49] has had a voice on the earth amen an
[25:51] oracle a way that he can get his word
[25:53] for that day to the people and what is
[25:56] the works of God Amen you can say not
[25:58] smoking not drinking not running around
[26:00] not doing any of that that's that's all
[26:02] part of it but the core of it is
[26:04] believing on him who he
[26:06] sent what good is it if you never smoked
[26:09] a cigarette a day in your life but you
[26:10] reject the very voice of God for your
[26:12] day and call it something that's evil
[26:14] and reject it and say it's not of God
[26:16] but you never smoked a day in your life
[26:18] and you never took a drink and you never
[26:19] used a swear word and you never cheated
[26:21] your
[26:24] neighbor amen and all of those things
[26:27] are good amen worthwhile attributes
[26:30] things that we appreciate and value
[26:32] things that we should emulate as
[26:34] Believers but when you get down to the
[26:36] core of it what is the works of God the
[26:38] works of God is believing who God sends
[26:41] and if God sends them God wants them
[26:43] respected God wants them heard God wants
[26:46] them listen to because they're the
[26:47] mouthpiece of
[26:50] God to reject the voice of the
[26:53] mouthpiece in that day is to reject God
[26:56] because the mouthpiece is not bringing
[26:57] their own ideas they're bringing the
[26:59] word of
[27:00] God yes
[27:03] amen so let's go to First
[27:07] Corinthians now and and grab a couple
[27:10] more scriptures here 1 Corinthians
[27:12] chapter
[27:17] 4 in 1 Corinthians chapter
[27:23] 4 chapter 4 verse 1 1 Corinthians
[27:27] chapter 4
[27:30] verse1 this is Paul now he's speaking
[27:33] said let a man so account of us as of
[27:35] the Ministers of Christ and stewards of
[27:38] the mysteries of
[27:39] God what what was he saying Paul was
[27:42] saying we we are stewards of the mystery
[27:44] of God meaning that we are we are
[27:47] watching over we're we're taking care of
[27:49] a steward of a house amen was was like
[27:51] when Joseph was Steward in Piper's house
[27:53] he was taking care of the house watching
[27:55] over Distributing and dispensing amen
[27:57] things from the house amen here Paul is
[28:00] now saying we're stewards of the
[28:02] mysteries of God which means we're
[28:04] watching over and dispensing the
[28:06] mysteries of
[28:07] God and so what is it to do the works of
[28:10] God to believe on him he hath sent who
[28:12] is Paul Paul was one who was sent he
[28:15] says I have sent thee to be a light to
[28:17] the
[28:18] Gentiles now let's go over to First
[28:24] John we're going to look at the words of
[28:26] of of John joh over here in the Epistles
[28:29] of John in 1
[28:32] John 1
[28:34] John
[28:36] 4 now John was one of the Disciples of
[28:38] the
[28:39] Lord and me he was one of those the
[28:42] apostles who was commissioned to
[28:44] dispense the truth to go out into all
[28:46] the world and in in 1 John
[28:50] 4:4 he begins to say this ye are of God
[28:54] little children and have overcome them
[28:56] because greater is he that is in you
[28:58] than he that is in the world they are of
[29:00] the world therefore speak they of the
[29:02] world and the world heareth them we are
[29:05] of God he that knoweth God heareth
[29:09] us he that is not of God heareth not us
[29:13] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[29:15] the spirit of
[29:18] error and you make a statement like that
[29:20] I mean that's a that's a very bold
[29:22] declaration I mean that's a statement
[29:25] that that that I mean I praise God Amen
[29:31] John could say it right John was one of
[29:34] the Apostles of the Lord he was
[29:36] commissioned by God God told him per
[29:38] personally amen you go into all the
[29:41] world and you bear record of the truth
[29:43] amen and you go and as many as believe
[29:45] in are baptized shall be saved amen if
[29:47] they believe not they sh they shall be
[29:48] damned God told him himself his
[29:50] commission and told him to go to do it
[29:52] when he goes as in commission he knows
[29:54] what the truth is he knows what his
[29:55] commission is and when he goes out as an
[29:58] oracle of God as a steward of the
[29:59] mystery of God and he dispenses that
[30:02] truth amen those who are of God hear him
[30:05] those who don't hear him are not of
[30:07] God why can he say that he's not looking
[30:10] at his flesh he's looking at the
[30:12] Mysteries that he's holding he's looking
[30:14] at the dispensation of truth that he has
[30:16] not in his flesh it has nothing to do
[30:18] with John the person it has everything
[30:20] to do with John the Apostle commission
[30:22] to take the
[30:24] gospel praise God praise God
[30:29] the same thing's true with the prophet
[30:30] in this day it it wasn't the prophet it
[30:33] wasn't the man it wasn't the one who was
[30:36] who was 5' 6 or seven Ines and from
[30:38] Kentucky that wasn't it that's not the
[30:41] thing that that's respected we respect
[30:43] the vessel but because the vessel was
[30:45] the one that God used to bring the word
[30:48] I mean it what it is it's a dispensation
[30:51] of the mysteries of God he was a steward
[30:53] over the mystery of God commissioned by
[30:56] God God spoke Direct to him and said you
[30:59] take this out to the world this is the
[31:02] truth dispense this truth just the same
[31:04] as he told his
[31:08] disciples it was the angel of the Lord
[31:10] that came and gave him his commission it
[31:12] was the angel of the Lord that revealed
[31:13] the truth to him it was the angel of the
[31:15] Lord that came amen and told him to
[31:17] reveal the seals I mean that this is God
[31:20] now choosing his vessel and God sending
[31:22] his vessel and now God bringing the
[31:24] dispensation of the word through that
[31:26] vessel and now to do The Works of God is
[31:28] to receive him who God
[31:30] sent amen and it doesn't it's not the
[31:33] flesh amen we respect that we thank God
[31:36] for that it's not the flesh it's it's
[31:38] it's what God was bringing through that
[31:41] flesh which was a voice he was the voice
[31:43] of God in our
[31:45] day hey praise
[31:47] God this is so important because we're
[31:50] going to find out when we get to the end
[31:51] of the message Amen brother B tells us
[31:53] that God once again has a mouthpiece on
[31:55] the earth there is a voice the final
[31:57] voice to the final age is the Bride of
[31:59] Jesus
[32:01] Christ amen we may have all kinds of
[32:03] fallacies in our flesh and we may be
[32:05] riddled with all kinds of shortcomings
[32:07] amen but it's not the flesh we're
[32:09] looking at it's the dispensation of the
[32:11] truth it's where God's voice is and who
[32:13] God has sent in this day to propagate
[32:16] the
[32:17] truth
[32:20] Amen brother M says in the church age
[32:23] book right at the beginning in the first
[32:25] chapter of the revelation of Jesus
[32:27] Christ he has this to say you will
[32:29] recall that I
[32:31] mentioned at the beginning of this
[32:33] message that this book we are studying
[32:35] is the actual revelation of Jesus
[32:37] himself in the church in his Works in
[32:39] future ages then I mentioned that it
[32:41] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[32:43] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[32:46] bringing these two thoughts together you
[32:48] will see that it won't take just
[32:49] ordinary study and thinking to make the
[32:52] book
[32:52] real it's going to take the operation of
[32:55] the Holy Ghost that means this book
[32:58] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[33:00] special class of people praise God it'll
[33:03] take one with prophetic Insight it will
[33:06] require the ability to hear from God it
[33:10] will require Supernatural instruction
[33:12] not just a student comparing verse with
[33:14] verse though that is
[33:15] good goes on to say but a mystery
[33:17] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[33:19] it never becomes clear how we need to
[33:22] hear from God and lay ourselves open and
[33:24] become yielded to the spirit to hear and
[33:26] to know
[33:28] so he's coming to the introduction of
[33:29] the church age book and he's starting to
[33:31] begin the revelation of Jesus Christ
[33:33] which is in the first he's starting in
[33:35] the very first of the Book of Revelation
[33:37] which is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[33:39] the capping off of the entire Bible and
[33:41] as he goes in he says you're not going
[33:43] to get this from
[33:45] study and not anybody is going to
[33:48] understand
[33:51] this but it's going to take a special
[33:54] class of people praise God it's going to
[33:57] take a predestinated offspring of
[33:59] God it's going to take those who are
[34:02] destined to be amateur
[34:05] Gods amen
[34:08] amen it will require the ability to hear
[34:12] from God listen that's not a category
[34:15] you can put yourself
[34:17] in no matter how much you'd like to we
[34:21] can't that's a category that's been
[34:23] designated by predestination
[34:29] look at Matthew 13
[34:44] together Matthew Chapter
[34:48] 13 and verse
[34:53] 15 Matthew 13 and 15 for this people's
[34:57] heart heart is waxed gross and their
[34:59] ears are dull of hearing and their eyes
[35:01] they have closed lest at any time they
[35:04] should see with their eyes and hear with
[35:06] their ears and should understand with
[35:08] their heart and should be converted and
[35:10] I should heal
[35:12] them I love this because it gives us a
[35:14] definition of
[35:15] conversion what it takes to be
[35:18] converted it takes the ability to hear
[35:20] with the ear and see with the eye he
[35:23] says less than any time they should see
[35:25] with their eyes and hear with their ears
[35:27] and should
[35:28] understand with their heart that's
[35:30] Revelation
[35:31] am and should be converted and I should
[35:34] heal
[35:35] them but blessed are your eyes for they
[35:38] see and your ears for they hear
[35:42] amen
[35:44] amen praise God if we're able to hear
[35:48] this message and believe it receive it
[35:50] as truth that's the grace of God in our
[35:55] lives if we can if we can receive whom
[36:00] God has sent we can do the works of
[36:05] God again in the church age book in the
[36:08] same chapter revelation of Jesus Christ
[36:09] he says as I have already said this book
[36:12] Revelation is the con consummation of
[36:14] the Scriptures it is even placed exactly
[36:17] right in the cannon of scripture at the
[36:18] end now you can know why it is said that
[36:21] Anyone who reads or even hears it is
[36:23] blessed it is the revelation of God that
[36:26] will give you authority over over the
[36:29] devil praise
[36:31] God it is the revelation of God that
[36:33] will give you authority over the devil
[36:36] and you can see why they who would add
[36:38] or take away from it would be cursed it
[36:41] would have to be so for who can add or
[36:43] take away from the perfect revelation of
[36:45] God and overcome the enemy it is that
[36:48] simple there is nothing of such
[36:50] prevailing power as the revelation of
[36:52] the word see in verse three is a
[36:55] blessing is pronounced on those who give
[36:57] special attention to this book so I love
[36:59] that statement there is nothing of such
[37:02] prevailing power as the revelation of
[37:05] the
[37:05] word but you can only receive the
[37:07] revelation of the word if you're a
[37:09] special class of
[37:10] people CU it'll take the ability to hear
[37:13] from God it'll take a working of the
[37:15] Holy Ghost it will take a SE Gene of God
[37:18] down on the inside it'll take all of
[37:20] this for you to be able to receive the
[37:21] Revelation but if you receive the
[37:23] Revelation this is what he
[37:25] says he says uh
[37:30] he said it is the revelation of God that
[37:32] will give you authority over the
[37:34] devil there is nothing of such
[37:36] prevailing power as the revelation of
[37:39] the word so if we want Power amen what
[37:42] we need is the revelation of the word
[37:44] because there's nothing with as much
[37:46] prevailing power as the revelation of
[37:48] the word why did God bring the
[37:50] revelation of his word in the end time
[37:52] amen because he needed a bride that had
[37:54] overcoming power that could overcome all
[37:56] the lies and trappings of the devil and
[37:59] overcome hybridization and take a
[38:01] Rapture amen they needed prevailing
[38:03] power but there's nothing as with as
[38:05] much prevailing power as the revelation
[38:08] of the
[38:09] word amen you say I need power what we
[38:13] need to get on our knees and pray for is
[38:14] revelation amen God reveal yourself to
[38:17] me Reveal Your word to me open my eyes
[38:20] open my heart give me understanding and
[38:22] Revelation so that I have the power to
[38:24] overcome in this day amen it's not going
[38:26] to be will power it's not going to be
[38:28] mental power it's going to be the
[38:30] revelation of the word that unlocks the
[38:32] understanding that gives us authority
[38:34] over the devil that reveals who we
[38:36] really
[38:37] are
[38:40] amen this brings out the amateur
[38:43] Gods this unveils the amateur
[38:47] Gods our faith in present truth unveils
[38:51] our identity as sons of God Amen that's
[38:55] the way it's been from the beginning of
[38:56] time all the way through Abel was a Son
[38:59] of God because Abel could receive the
[39:02] Revelation for his day amen Cain could
[39:05] not receive it Cain could not even obey
[39:07] it he wasn't of God he was of the wicked
[39:10] one all the way down through the sons of
[39:13] God were able to receive the revelation
[39:15] of the word for their day and that was
[39:17] what differentiated them that's what
[39:20] unveiled them as sons of God and we know
[39:22] that sons of God are destined to be
[39:24] amateur Gods so what is the unveiling of
[39:26] the amateur Gods the veiling begins with
[39:29] faith the ability to receive present
[39:32] truth amen unveils our
[39:36] identity
[39:39] amen now I want to jump into the next
[39:42] subject that I want to look at let's go
[39:45] to Jude chapter
[39:50] 1 and it still has to do with the
[39:52] revelation of the word
[39:58] Jude chapter
[40:02] 1 we're going to read verse 14 I'm going
[40:05] to read just a little bit says and Enoch
[40:08] also the seventh from
[40:10] Adam Enoch was the seventh from Adam and
[40:13] we're going to find out that brother
[40:14] bandam typed this bride with Enoch and
[40:19] Enoch with this bride because Enoch was
[40:21] the seventh from Adam and so he was the
[40:24] seventh in dissension from Adam but
[40:26] Enoch was the one who took the Rapture
[40:28] and now we are the seventh from the last
[40:31] adamen in the seventh Church age and
[40:33] we're the one destined to take the
[40:35] Rapture so there's a parallel track
[40:37] between Enoch and the
[40:40] bride now let's go all the way back to
[40:42] Genesis 5 and look at this story of
[40:45] Enoch
[41:01] in Genesis chapter
[41:04] 5 uh let's begin in verse
[41:07] 21 Genesis 5 verse
[41:11] 21 and Enoch lived 6 and5 years and
[41:14] begat Methuselah and Enoch walked with
[41:17] God after he begat Methuselah 300 years
[41:20] and begat sons and daughters and all the
[41:22] days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch
[41:26] walked with God and he was not for God
[41:28] took him so Enoch walked with
[41:32] God and then he was not for God took him
[41:36] so he was
[41:37] raptured all right so this is what
[41:40] brother R says in the message hear ye
[41:42] him he says every move of Christ was
[41:44] ordered of God and he walked before God
[41:46] in the way that he pleased him oh I
[41:48] would love to have a testimony like that
[41:50] and I'm sure that every person in here
[41:52] would like Enoch of old who walked for
[41:55] hundreds of years before God and he had
[41:57] a testimony that he pleased him Enoch
[41:59] being a type of the church taken before
[42:02] the the tribulation he was taken before
[42:05] Noah's Ark and the tribulation and all
[42:07] that set forth brother B was using that
[42:08] as a type but Enoch is a type of the
[42:11] church the seventh from Adam and the one
[42:13] that was taken in the translation before
[42:15] tribulation amen so that's a perfect
[42:17] type of us but we know Enoch walked with
[42:20] God Amen if we go back in Hebrews 11:5
[42:24] you don't have to turn there but I'll
[42:25] quote it Hebrews 11:5 says by faith
[42:28] Enoch was translated so how was Enoch
[42:30] translated by
[42:33] Faith by faith Enoch was translated that
[42:36] he should not see death and was not
[42:38] found because God had translated him for
[42:41] before his translation he had this
[42:43] testimony that he pleased God but but
[42:46] without faith it is impossible to please
[42:49] him for he that cometh the God must
[42:51] believe that he is and that he's a
[42:52] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[42:54] him so Enoch walked with God 300 years
[42:58] after he begot his son Methuselah he
[43:00] walked with God Amen let's just read it
[43:03] again because we're still here in
[43:04] Genesis
[43:05] 5 uh verse 22 and Enoch walked with God
[43:08] after he begot methusa 300 years and
[43:10] begot sons and daughters and all the
[43:12] days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch
[43:15] walked with God and he was not for God
[43:19] took him so we know now in Hebrews that
[43:23] he had this testimony that he pleased
[43:26] God and then immediately after uh Paul
[43:29] in Hebrew says he pleased God this was
[43:31] his testimony he walked with God and he
[43:34] pleased God and then he says but without
[43:36] faith it is impossible to please God so
[43:39] what was pleasing to God was Enoch's
[43:41] faith in the word of God was pleasing to
[43:44] God and he walked with God 300 years and
[43:46] he was not for God took him amen took
[43:49] him in the Rapture and his translation
[43:51] was by faith amen his Walking with God
[43:55] was building faith his pleasing of God
[43:57] was by faith and his translation was by
[43:59] [Applause]
[44:00] faith
[44:03] hallelujah
[44:05] amen we know uh when God I'm I'm jumping
[44:11] around but just hang on let me jump yes
[44:14] just hang
[44:16] tight when Saul had refused to keep the
[44:19] word of
[44:21] God God had rejected Saul from being
[44:23] King and and he told Samuel I will
[44:25] choose a man after my own
[44:27] heart and he chose David and he says a
[44:30] man after his own heart and he tells him
[44:32] it's a man after my own heart amen and
[44:34] he's chosen but when we come to the book
[44:36] of Acts Luke in the book of Acts begins
[44:39] to tell us why he's a man after God's
[44:41] Own harm and he says when he had removed
[44:44] him he raised up unto them David this is
[44:46] acts 13 David to be their King to whom
[44:48] also he gave testimony and said I have
[44:50] found David the son of Jesse a man after
[44:53] my own heart which shall fulfill all my
[44:56] will so what made him a man after God's
[44:59] Own Heart Is that he will fulfill all
[45:00] his will well brother brandham told us
[45:03] what the will of God is he said his will
[45:05] is his word so that means David would do
[45:08] would keep all the word of God Amen
[45:10] showing that he had faith in the word of
[45:13] God because it's impossible to please
[45:15] God without
[45:16] faith so he was a man after God's Own
[45:19] Heart because he would he would do he
[45:22] would fulfill all of his will and his
[45:24] word is his will
[45:27] amen so brother Brenan makes this
[45:29] statement many many times I just grabbed
[45:31] one spot here he said what's he doing
[45:33] he's writing his first Bible he's
[45:35] talking about the Stars the placing of
[45:36] the Stars the first Bible was ever
[45:38] written was written in the skies the
[45:39] Zodiac it starts out with the virgin
[45:42] that's how he come first it ends with
[45:43] Leo the Lion the second coming and he's
[45:45] writing his first Bible the second Bible
[45:48] was written was written by Enoch and put
[45:51] in the pyramid the third Bible was
[45:53] written and this is the last one brother
[45:55] bam was patting his Bible God always
[45:57] does things in three God is perfected in
[45:59] three he's perfect and then in adoption
[46:02] 1960 he says the next Bible was written
[46:04] was in stone called a pyramid God wrote
[46:07] in the pyramids so now we find out that
[46:11] Enoch now remember Enoch is a type of
[46:13] the
[46:14] Bride so Enoch brother the prophet of
[46:17] God tells us that Enoch made that
[46:21] pyramid you know what I love about this
[46:23] message is that God sent us a prophet
[46:26] amen
[46:29] who could unveil so many Mysteries to us
[46:33] amen and he said now Enoch Enoch he made
[46:36] that pyramid and that pyramid is god's
[46:38] second Bible it's the word of God in
[46:41] stone form written in stone and brother
[46:43] M goes through all kinds of different
[46:44] types and we we might read into that in
[46:46] just a second on how it types out
[46:48] different things and the main one he
[46:49] uses is there's no capping Stone amen
[46:51] because when the Capstone came it was
[46:53] rejected and when Jesus Christ came he
[46:55] was rejected
[46:57] but he he says this in the in the future
[47:00] home this being this way would answer
[47:02] exactly Enoch's sign in Egypt the
[47:04] pyramid wouldn't it Enoch before the
[47:07] antoian destruction when justification
[47:09] was coming in he brought forth a sign
[47:11] and then this pyramid is seven steps
[47:13] going to the king's chamber watch on the
[47:15] seventh step if you ever studied the
[47:17] dimensions of the pyramid what comes out
[47:19] to take the oncom to introduced to the
[47:21] king watch those stations that is
[47:23] standing there and you'll see the day
[47:25] you're living in in the
[47:28] pyramid brother B said it the Bible's
[47:31] written out in the pyramid and when you
[47:33] go into the pyramid in the grand Gallery
[47:35] I've never been there but I've I've seen
[47:37] pictures and the grand Gallery the grand
[47:39] Gallery is made up of huge stones on
[47:41] either side and they spped their way to
[47:42] the top and there's seven steps in the
[47:44] grand Gallery going all the way up
[47:47] because there's seven steps in the
[47:48] church age coming all the way up to the
[47:50] king's
[47:51] chamber amen but the seventh step is a
[47:53] big step amen they call it the great
[47:56] step amen the not the seventh step those
[47:58] are seven steps going up but when you
[48:00] get to the top of the ramp all the way
[48:01] up to where the king's chamber is
[48:03] there's a high step you have to step up
[48:05] on and it's not an easy step to make
[48:07] it's a high step they call it the great
[48:10] Step at the top and brother Bram said at
[48:13] the great step he says in other places
[48:15] he said that's where amen that's where
[48:17] there's one to greet the comer and Usher
[48:19] them into the presence of the king amen
[48:21] and he types that with the Elijah
[48:23] Ministry that was in John the Baptist
[48:25] but also in our day there's been
[48:27] somebody standing on the top of that
[48:28] great step to help us up to step and
[48:31] Usher us into to the presence of the
[48:33] king and it's written in the
[48:35] pyramid and who told us that a prophet
[48:39] and you believe it amen why do you
[48:42] believe that you know how many people in
[48:44] the world don't believe that they see a
[48:46] step they try to figure it out seven
[48:48] things in the T that's yeah whatever but
[48:50] we had a Prophet come and tell us that
[48:53] and you believe it's the truth we do and
[48:56] you believe it has something to do with
[48:57] you and where you're at in this day
[48:59] where did that come from
[49:11] friends now when he ushers you into
[49:15] the presence of the king and you go into
[49:18] the king's chamber there's all kinds of
[49:19] things there I don't know how to discern
[49:20] it all I've looked at it I've got ideas
[49:23] but I I I don't want to venture without
[49:24] Authority so I'm not going to try to
[49:26] discern it all but when you go in there
[49:28] there they got what they call a
[49:29] sarcophagus there there's a there's a
[49:31] box there's a granite box and me but
[49:33] when you go in there's no lid and
[49:35] there's no body and there's nothing
[49:36] there because we don't serve a dead God
[49:38] we serve a resurrected Jesus Christ Our
[49:41] King is alive not dead amen then you go
[49:44] to the brother R talked about this you
[49:46] go to the to the top of the pyramid amen
[49:48] and he said the Capstone was never put
[49:51] on because they rejected
[49:53] it how does he know they rejected it
[49:55] because the Bible says they rejected it
[49:57] cuz when Jesus Christ came amen what was
[50:00] he he was the Chief Cornerstone they
[50:01] rejected it he was the capping off of
[50:03] the Old Testament brother man said he
[50:05] built this body all the way through the
[50:07] prophets he built it up through the
[50:08] prophets and through the Proverbs and
[50:10] through the Psalms amen but when he
[50:11] caught to the head of IT the capping off
[50:13] of the Old Testament they rejected that
[50:15] headstone but that headstone became the
[50:17] Cornerstone for the bride and he built
[50:19] up Seven Ages on top of this and then
[50:22] when he came again amen as The Headstone
[50:24] it was rejected by the world and
[50:26] rejected by the denominations but it was
[50:28] received by the by the people of God
[50:31] Amen that headstone has
[50:34] come and so now he he goes on here in
[50:36] future
[50:38] home he said watch those stations that
[50:41] is standing there and you'll see the day
[50:42] you're living in the pyramid now God
[50:45] made three Bibles now there's a pyramid
[50:46] teaching that's nonsense but there's a
[50:48] genuine pyramid notice now God he made
[50:51] three there have to be everything in
[50:54] threes Jesus come three times he come
[50:56] one wants to redeem his bride next time
[50:57] to get his bride next time with his
[50:59] bride see now notice how beautiful see
[51:02] and in the pyramid was seven steps and
[51:03] in the king's chamber and we're in the
[51:06] seventh Church age before the king takes
[51:08] his throne and remember the pyramid
[51:10] never did have a Capstone on it God's
[51:13] first Bible was in the skies the Zodiac
[51:15] it starts off runs every Age The First
[51:17] beginning of the zodiac is a virgin
[51:20] that's how he come first the last figure
[51:22] in the zodiac is a Leo the Lion the
[51:23] second coming just before there is a
[51:26] cross fish which is cancer age that's
[51:28] where we're living in now there was a
[51:30] pyramid after that Enoch which testifies
[51:34] exactly we wouldn't have time to go into
[51:37] it but someday by God's help I'll show
[51:39] you just exactly draws the dimension of
[51:42] the hour We're
[51:44] living why because the Bible's in the
[51:47] pyramid if we knew how to read it we
[51:49] would be able to read everything that's
[51:51] in the Bible in the pyramid the problem
[51:53] is we don't know how to read it brother
[51:55] brenham's not here we're not going to
[51:56] venture without Authority but what we
[51:58] have is the message and the message will
[52:00] unlock what's in the pyramid not that we
[52:02] have to go look at the stones just look
[52:04] at the
[52:05] message we've been given the the
[52:08] unveiling of the word the first Bible he
[52:11] wrote in the heavens amen now that's
[52:13] obscured to us because there's been a
[52:15] lot of lost information the Earth have
[52:16] been knocked off its axis all kinds of
[52:18] things we can't discern what's going on
[52:20] there it's been corrupted and polluted
[52:22] now the pyramid has been looted and
[52:24] there's been the casing stones have been
[52:25] taken off and all kinds of stuff has
[52:27] happened to it we may not be able to
[52:29] read that especially without a prophet
[52:30] here but this was his third Bible
[52:32] written out on paper and given to us but
[52:34] in the days we live in there's been a
[52:36] prophet who stood on that great step
[52:38] amen and God gave him the revelation of
[52:41] this entire mystery to peel the seals
[52:43] off and take the veil off so that we can
[52:45] see what's been hidden in this mystery
[52:47] all these
[52:49] years so I don't have to go to the
[52:51] pyramid I don't have to go to the Zodiac
[52:53] I can go right here to the Bible that's
[52:55] been unveiled before our
[52:58] eyes thank you amen so I'm not trying to
[53:01] get us to go look at the pyramid don't
[53:03] don't think that I just want to show
[53:04] that
[53:06] Enoch Enoch had the revelation of the
[53:09] word right and Enoch is the seventh from
[53:13] Adam and Enoch is a type of the church
[53:15] so if Enoch was our type the foreshadow
[53:18] of what's going on today Enoch had the
[53:20] Revelation he had the full revelation of
[53:22] the word because he built the entire
[53:25] pyramid right
[53:27] so what is the bride what is the church
[53:29] going to have at the end time the full
[53:30] revelation of the
[53:34] word
[53:37] amen in the message God's provided place
[53:40] of worship he says now we find out that
[53:42] Enoch came into God's provided way with
[53:44] his word and walked 500 years and
[53:47] pleased him and we find out that the
[53:48] mechanics was so perfect in him that
[53:51] when the Dynamics got to working in the
[53:52] engine it just took him off the Earth he
[53:54] took the first airplane flight like to
[53:56] Heaven working on God's mechanics and
[53:58] Dynamics together he was not because God
[54:01] took him out of the earth without death
[54:03] that's exactly right he was walking in
[54:06] God's provided way so what was God's
[54:09] provided way it was the
[54:10] word Enoch was walking in the word amen
[54:15] praise
[54:16] God now brother B says in again in in
[54:21] another message called God's only
[54:22] provided place of worship he says now
[54:25] let us look at some that has been
[54:28] quickened into this house of God of
[54:30] their age Enoch he says look Enoch was
[54:34] the Living Word of God of his age he was
[54:37] a prophet amen what was Enoch Enoch was
[54:41] Enoch was the Living Word of God for his
[54:44] age amen what was Enoch then he was
[54:47] whatever is wrote in stone is in flesh
[54:49] am amen he was walking with the Lord he
[54:53] was walking in the word he was the
[54:55] seventh from Adam he was going to be
[54:57] foreshadowing he already laid it he had
[54:59] already laid it in the in the grand
[55:01] Gallery he already laid it in the great
[55:03] step and in the king's CH it was already
[55:04] laid there and now he was walking in the
[55:06] earth fleshing out what he had already
[55:08] wrote in that stone cuz he already put
[55:10] it in there but now he's walking with
[55:12] the Lord and at some point he walks with
[55:14] the Lord as the seventh from Adam Oh my
[55:17] he walked with the Lord until the Lord
[55:19] was so pleased with him amen he walked
[55:21] with the Lord till the Lord just took
[55:23] him
[55:24] amen amen
[55:28] how did he please the Lord he had faith
[55:31] in that
[55:33] word he had faith in that
[55:36] word oh praise
[55:40] God see Enoch I just want to look at
[55:44] Enoch for a minute the word Enoch means
[55:47] dedicated Enoch was dedicated but it
[55:50] comes from a root word the root word of
[55:52] the word that makes up Enoch the root
[55:54] word means to train up
[55:57] amen has this bride been trained up over
[56:00] Seven Ages trained up to what to be
[56:03] dedicated dedicated to what dedicated to
[56:05] this word dedicated to our Lord
[56:08] dedicated to Christ and that's what
[56:09] Enoch was he was dedicated to the word
[56:11] that's what it means to walk with the
[56:13] Lord how could he not how could he walk
[56:15] with the Lord if he was walking out of
[56:17] step with the Lord's
[56:19] word amen he was walking with the word
[56:23] and as he as he walked with the word
[56:25] listen Enoch built the Pyramid so Enoch
[56:28] had a revelation right amen is that
[56:31] right yes he had a revelation of the
[56:33] word of God he had a revelation of the
[56:35] plan of
[56:38] God that and he also had a relationship
[56:42] with
[56:43] God CU he walked with God that's right
[56:47] I've been asking my myself this question
[56:49] which came first the chicken or the egg
[56:52] did he have a revelation first and then
[56:55] a relationship or for a relationship
[56:57] that brought a
[56:59] revelation I don't have the answer but
[57:01] the truth is he had a revelation and he
[57:03] had a
[57:04] relationship I I can come to that
[57:06] conclusion
[57:07] safely amen what is the bride supposed
[57:09] to have what is a revelation supposed to
[57:11] do a revelation should bring us into a
[57:13] greater relationship and a greater
[57:15] relationship should bring a greater
[57:16] Revelation amen these two things should
[57:18] feed off each other and they did for
[57:20] Enoch Enoch's Revelation didn't send him
[57:23] away from the Lord but Enoch's
[57:24] Revelation put him War walking with the
[57:26] Lord and walking with the Lord didn't
[57:28] give him the wrong Revelation walking
[57:30] with the Lord kept him in the right
[57:33] Revelation so what did Enoch have that
[57:35] we need he had a revelation of the word
[57:38] and he had a relationship with the Lord
[57:40] he was walking with the
[57:42] Lord so listen he had Revelation
[57:47] relationship and
[57:49] Rapture God what is this bride going to
[57:51] have Revelation relationship and Rapture
[57:55] amen
[57:56] amen amen I do know what preceded the
[58:00] Rapture I may not know which came first
[58:01] the chicken or egg but I do know the
[58:03] Revelation and the relationship did
[58:05] precede the
[58:07] Rapture amen and I do know that he
[58:10] walked with the Lord 300
[58:13] years Andy listen so we shouldn't get
[58:16] discouraged walking with the Lord under
[58:18] this Revelation amen let's just keep
[58:20] walking with the Lord amen it doesn't
[58:22] matter if it's been 60 years since the
[58:23] prophet came 70 years since the the the
[58:26] seals were open it doesn't matter Enoch
[58:28] had a revelation he had a revelation of
[58:30] the word he even knew that he was the
[58:32] seventh from Adam he was now fleshing
[58:34] out that word as he fleshed out the word
[58:37] he was walking with the Lord for 300
[58:39] years and in 300 years then the Lord
[58:41] took him amen so if we walk with the
[58:43] Lord 300 years under this Revelation
[58:45] we're still not out of kilter with
[58:48] Enoch let's not get discourage let's
[58:50] just walk closer and closer to the Lord
[58:53] as we keep walking with him day by day
[58:55] amen may take us a little more time to
[58:58] get into the step with what we've
[59:00] received amen what did we receive we
[59:02] received a pyramid worth Revelation yes
[59:07] that's right it may take some walking
[59:09] with the Lord to get this Revelation to
[59:11] sink
[59:12] in that's what Enoch
[59:15] had praise
[59:18] God brother bam says in Christ is the
[59:20] mystery of God revealed he said
[59:23] identified all the devil is howling
[59:25] about this the Manifest Ed truth of the
[59:26] promise of the word in her
[59:29] alone they don't have the answer when
[59:31] Jesus came why didn't those Pharisees he
[59:33] said if I cast out Devils by the Finger
[59:35] of God who do you cast them out by he
[59:37] stood alone and his church stands
[59:42] alone this is a remarkable
[59:46] statement who took a Rapture with
[59:52] Enoch he stood alone
[59:56] it doesn't mention anybody else it
[59:57] doesn't mention his Partnerships it
[59:59] doesn't mention his church it doesn't
[1:00:00] mention his community Enoch walked with
[1:00:03] God he had a private fellowship and a
[1:00:06] walk with God between him and God and
[1:00:08] that that led him into a translation
[1:00:12] amen and that translation was by
[1:00:14] faith amen so this church stands alone
[1:00:18] she's not hooked with nothing but he was
[1:00:21] identified by God being the body that
[1:00:23] God dwelt in and the church is
[1:00:25] identified by his body doing the same
[1:00:27] thing she is his body amen the
[1:00:30] manifested truth of his promised word
[1:00:32] for the last days and she and she alone
[1:00:35] stands by it so what is she she's the
[1:00:37] manifested truth of his promised word
[1:00:39] for this day she becomes what Enoch was
[1:00:42] Enoch was the word made flesh for his
[1:00:45] day she becomes the same thing Enoch was
[1:00:48] the word made flesh for our day walking
[1:00:51] with the Lord growing in faith growing
[1:00:53] in relationship growing in Revelation
[1:00:56] until when until these atoms change
[1:00:58] until Faith takes a hold and we
[1:01:03] leave
[1:01:05] amen now listen let's go to Amos
[1:01:09] 3 oh praise be to God let's go to Amos
[1:01:13] chapter
[1:01:20] 3 me this is really
[1:01:24] important Amos chapter 3
[1:01:26] three I could turn there
[1:01:37] together Amos 3
[1:01:41] 3 can two walk together except they be
[1:01:46] agreed Enoch walked with the Lord can
[1:01:50] two walk together except they be agreed
[1:01:53] [Laughter]
[1:01:53] [Music]
[1:01:56] amen how how could how could the Lord
[1:01:59] come and walk with Enoch unless there
[1:02:01] was an agreement between him and Enoch
[1:02:03] amen what was the agreement between him
[1:02:05] and Enoch Enoch had a revelation of the
[1:02:08] word and that revelation of the word
[1:02:10] became flesh in his body and as he
[1:02:13] walked and fleshed out that word he was
[1:02:14] walking with the Lord and he was in
[1:02:16] agreement with the revelation of the
[1:02:18] word and the Lord could walk with him
[1:02:20] because how can two walk together unless
[1:02:22] they be agreed amen amen there has to be
[1:02:26] an
[1:02:28] agreement amen now listen I want to go
[1:02:31] back for just a second to brother bram's
[1:02:34] experience in Colorado because we talked
[1:02:36] about it before how brother brandham was
[1:02:38] In This Storm rolling in the situation
[1:02:41] was dangerous and the Lord spoke to him
[1:02:43] and sent him back into the storm and he
[1:02:44] goes back into the storm and and he's
[1:02:46] trying to sort out what's going on with
[1:02:48] the voice speaks and then he speaks
[1:02:50] through the storm and the storm obeys
[1:02:51] his voice this whole scene showing that
[1:02:54] Redemption is coming full circle and
[1:02:56] bringing back everything Adam lost back
[1:02:58] into the hands of not Jesus Christ
[1:03:00] virgin born but sin born flesh that's
[1:03:04] the fullness of redemption amen bringing
[1:03:06] it back to Fallen man and now he can
[1:03:08] speak the nature the way Adam spake the
[1:03:10] nature and now he speaks to the nature
[1:03:12] it does exactly what he says but then
[1:03:14] God makes this statement to him he says
[1:03:17] now he says uh I just stood there just
[1:03:22] looking around with my hat off the
[1:03:23] clouds had already went away I got num
[1:03:26] all over I thought the very God of
[1:03:28] creation it's all in his hands what's he
[1:03:29] telling me and I picked up my gun and I
[1:03:32] wiped off the scope and I started to
[1:03:34] walk to go down the hill listen I I love
[1:03:37] this I I said this last time but brother
[1:03:39] man is so human so real these things are
[1:03:42] real amen they're not religious fairy
[1:03:44] tales and they're not a man trying to
[1:03:45] make himself something he says all this
[1:03:47] happened and when it was over I was numb
[1:03:49] I looked around and the sky was blue and
[1:03:51] the sun was out and the storm was gone
[1:03:53] and then he didn't know what to do next
[1:03:55] he didn't have super understanding he
[1:03:57] picked up his gun and wiped off the
[1:03:59] scope and started walking back to Camp
[1:04:02] yeah amen oh praise be to God Hey listen
[1:04:07] we don't have to have everything figured
[1:04:08] out and we don't have to have a
[1:04:09] spiritual answer for anything sometimes
[1:04:11] something happens and the next thing to
[1:04:12] do is go back to stirring the beans for
[1:04:14] supper cuz you don't know what else to
[1:04:16] do get up in the morning and go back to
[1:04:17] work because I had a supernatural
[1:04:19] experience what do I do next what do you
[1:04:21] do next just pick up your gun and go
[1:04:23] walking down the hill amen if God wants
[1:04:25] to do something else he'll speak
[1:04:27] something else God amen amen the problem
[1:04:31] is we try to be spiritual we don't need
[1:04:33] to try to be spiritual that's something
[1:04:35] that happens naturally as we get in
[1:04:37] agreement with the word and just walk in
[1:04:38] our life with the word God will come to
[1:04:41] us God will speak to us amen if we stay
[1:04:43] in Harmony and unity with his word how
[1:04:45] can two walk together lest they be
[1:04:47] agreed but if they're agreed they can
[1:04:48] walk together so let's move our lives
[1:04:50] into agreement with the word and yield
[1:04:52] ourselves to him and give him a place
[1:04:54] where he can come whenever he wants to
[1:04:57] come picks up his gun wipes off the
[1:05:00] scope starts walking down the hill but
[1:05:03] God wasn't done
[1:05:05] hallelujah amen and something said to
[1:05:09] me why don't you stroll with me through
[1:05:13] the wilderness walk with
[1:05:17] me why don't you stroll with me through
[1:05:20] the wilderness walk with me brother said
[1:05:23] I said yes Lord with all my heart
[1:05:26] it would be one of the greatest things I
[1:05:28] could do was walk with you so I put my
[1:05:30] gun over my shoulder and started walking
[1:05:32] down through that never ax laid to it
[1:05:34] virgin Timber walking through there what
[1:05:37] was virgin Timber everything had come
[1:05:39] back to the Garden again virgin Timber
[1:05:41] the animals wouldn't leave him control
[1:05:42] of nature now he's walking with God just
[1:05:45] like God come down in the cool of the
[1:05:47] evening and walked with his children but
[1:05:49] how did he walk with them he walked with
[1:05:51] them the same way he's walking with the
[1:05:53] prophet I tell you what did Brother
[1:05:55] brandom
[1:05:58] see did he see a figure did he see a man
[1:06:02] what was the stature what was the
[1:06:05] shape you realize brother Brenham never
[1:06:07] told us he saw
[1:06:09] anything he heard a
[1:06:12] voice go with me back to Genesis chapter
[1:06:19] 3 Genesis chapter 3
[1:06:25] praise God this is after man had fallen
[1:06:28] made fig leaves was hiding in amongst
[1:06:30] the trees in verse chapter 3 Genesis CH
[1:06:33] 3:8 and they heard the voice of the Lord
[1:06:36] God walking in the garden it never said
[1:06:38] they saw anything there was no Vis no
[1:06:41] form that they described or that they
[1:06:42] saw but they heard the voice of the Lord
[1:06:45] walking in the garden and we know that
[1:06:47] he came down in the cool of the evening
[1:06:48] to walk was his children now they know
[1:06:51] he's in the garden not because they hear
[1:06:53] footsteps or because they see him they
[1:06:55] hear his voice walking in the garden and
[1:06:58] Adam hid himself and listen it says they
[1:07:01] heard the voice of the Lord God Walking
[1:07:02] In The Garden in the cool of the day and
[1:07:04] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[1:07:06] the presence of the Lord God amongst the
[1:07:08] Trees of the garden and the Lord God
[1:07:10] called unto Adam and said unto him where
[1:07:12] art thou and he said I heard thy voice
[1:07:15] in the garden and I was afraid because I
[1:07:17] was naked and I hid myself he says I
[1:07:21] heard thy
[1:07:22] voice in the garden amen and it says
[1:07:26] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:07:28] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[1:07:31] evening and now brother Branham is up in
[1:07:35] this condition he's in virgin Timber God
[1:07:37] spoke to him and told him to speak to
[1:07:39] the storms and move away and then all of
[1:07:41] a sudden he says why don't you stroll
[1:07:43] with me walk with me brother R said oh I
[1:07:46] would love that and brother Ram never
[1:07:48] tells us a man appears or a Visage of of
[1:07:50] an angel or something no he's just
[1:07:52] what's he walking with he's walking with
[1:07:54] the voice that speaking to him he's
[1:07:56] walking in the presence of the Lord he's
[1:07:58] walking with the Lord amen and you know
[1:08:01] what he does the next thing he says is
[1:08:03] and then I just thought I might go to
[1:08:04] that place where I remember my wife and
[1:08:07] he goes over Hey listen there he's
[1:08:09] walking with the Lord but the Lord's not
[1:08:11] saying anymore there's not a dialogue
[1:08:13] going back and forth he doesn't see
[1:08:14] anybody he's just immersed in the
[1:08:16] presence of the Lord walking with the
[1:08:18] Lord having thoughts about his wife and
[1:08:21] their anniversary and going to the
[1:08:22] little stand of Aspen trees and what's
[1:08:24] he doing he's walking with the Lord
[1:08:28] amen praise God
[1:08:31] Amen so when Enoch was walking with God
[1:08:34] it may have been different than what our
[1:08:36] imagination imagines because Enoch had
[1:08:38] the revelation of the word and he
[1:08:40] pleased God and he had Faith amen and he
[1:08:42] was walking with God for 300 years he
[1:08:45] was walking with
[1:08:47] Goden so does that mean for 300 years he
[1:08:50] had an appointment and every day at 5:05
[1:08:53] he would go take a walk with God or was
[1:08:54] he walking with God for 300 years how
[1:08:58] was he Walking with God for 300 years
[1:09:00] what did he look like what was the form
[1:09:02] what was the description he had the
[1:09:04] voice of God he had the word of God the
[1:09:06] presence of God was with him and he was
[1:09:08] walking with the Lord for 300
[1:09:14] years praise
[1:09:16] God so glad God showed us yes and a
[1:09:20] prophet amen amen visibly he took one
[1:09:24] man out of all the other men and he
[1:09:26] showed what he was going to do amen
[1:09:28] remember God does nothingless he first
[1:09:30] reveals it through a Prophet by a
[1:09:32] prophet so what did he do the prophet
[1:09:34] was showing what God wants to do he
[1:09:36] wants to do it in his whole body but he
[1:09:38] picked up this man first and he did it
[1:09:39] in the prophet to show what he wants to
[1:09:41] do what does he want to do he wants to
[1:09:43] walk with you and I he wants to live in
[1:09:45] us he wants to speak to us he wants to
[1:09:47] manifest the word through
[1:09:50] US
[1:09:51] amen I just want to walk with him
[1:09:56] brother baham says in the message Feast
[1:09:59] of
[1:10:00] trumpets he says notice the loosing of
[1:10:03] this ecclesiastical Spirit now 20 years
[1:10:06] later after the war we see the loosing
[1:10:07] of the ecclesiastical Spirit what under
[1:10:09] the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to
[1:10:11] the Jew look at the Moon darkening what
[1:10:13] under see it draw out the son of man
[1:10:16] being drove from the church what is it
[1:10:18] joining in with the ecclesiastical Bunch
[1:10:21] now the E ecumenical move with the World
[1:10:24] Council of churches has drove every man
[1:10:26] what does the thing stand for why you
[1:10:29] have to surrender all your Evangelical
[1:10:31] teachings and things how can two walk
[1:10:33] together lest they be agreed so brother
[1:10:36] Brenham this is the the premise which he
[1:10:38] takes for the the failure of the World
[1:10:41] Council of churches how can two walk
[1:10:43] together lest they be agreed he says
[1:10:45] they can't Jesus said they can't and how
[1:10:48] can a church the Methodist Baptist walk
[1:10:50] together how can the Church of Christ
[1:10:51] walk with the Presbyterian how can the
[1:10:53] Catholic walk with the Protestant how
[1:10:55] can Protestant walk with
[1:10:57] Protestant now listen what he says next
[1:11:00] but the bride can walk with the
[1:11:04] word oh do you want to take a little
[1:11:07] stroll today how many wants to walk with
[1:11:09] him in this end time message amen how
[1:11:11] many has heard the voice of God as he's
[1:11:13] coming back into his garden his bride
[1:11:16] amen how many heard his voice and want
[1:11:17] to walk with
[1:11:19] him but the bride can walk with the word
[1:11:22] which is Christ it must be an agreement
[1:11:26] not the ecclesiastical system but the
[1:11:28] word you have to agree with the word to
[1:11:30] walk with the
[1:11:32] word amen you have to agree with the
[1:11:35] word you have to believe in the word you
[1:11:36] have to have faith in the word because
[1:11:37] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:11:39] him and how can two walk together lest
[1:11:41] they be agreed but the bride can walk
[1:11:43] with the word why because she's coming
[1:11:46] into agreement with the word amen she's
[1:11:48] coming into Unity with the word she's
[1:11:51] received it by faith she's walking in it
[1:11:53] she's surrendering to it she's lining up
[1:11:55] up to it she's becoming what Enoch was
[1:11:57] in his day Enoch was fleshing out what
[1:12:00] was in stone was in flesh in
[1:12:02] Enoch amen and what is written in ink is
[1:12:05] becoming flesh in his bride it became
[1:12:08] flesh in Jesus Christ what is the bride
[1:12:10] she's the New Testament that's all
[1:12:12] that's what brother bam told us she is
[1:12:14] the flesh flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:12:17] bone life of his life she's the peace
[1:12:19] that was smitten off of him been formed
[1:12:21] through seven Church ages now coming

[1:12:25] The Headstone coming to complete the
[1:12:27] image Amen to what to re replicate

[1:12:32] is she here to do she's here to walk
[1:12:35] with the word and flesh out amen the
[1:12:39] word of this day that word amen and how
[1:12:43] does she walk with him she must be in
[1:12:46] agreement how is she going to get an
[1:12:49] agreement it's got to take the spirit of
[1:12:52] Revelation it's got to take the spirit
[1:12:54] of God God to bring us into agreement
[1:12:57] with the word so that we can walk with
[1:13:01] him I don't know about you but I've
[1:13:03] heard his voice oh yes am as he was
[1:13:07] coming back to his

[1:13:25] his
[1:13:26] voice I want to walk with
[1:13:30] him brother B said in the Rapture
[1:13:35] message he said but to the church the
[1:13:37] bride the Rapture is a revelation to
[1:13:40] her it's revealed to her that's the
[1:13:43] Revelation the true bride of Christ will
[1:13:45] be waiting for that revelation of the
[1:13:47] Rapture now it is a revelation for the
[1:13:50] Revelation is Faith and you cannot have
[1:13:53] Revelation without it being faith faith
[1:13:56] is a revelation because it's something
[1:13:58] that's revealed to you faith is a
[1:14:01] revelation faith is something that has
[1:14:03] been revealed to you like it was to
[1:14:05] Abraham that could call anything
[1:14:08] contrary to what had been revealed to
[1:14:09] him as though it wasn't so now Faith
[1:14:12] that's what faith is is the revelation
[1:14:15] of
[1:14:16] God and the Rapture will be the a faith
[1:14:20] it will be a revelation Faith to the
[1:14:23] bride
[1:14:27] amen let's turn together to first
[1:14:29] Thessalonians it's the last scripture I
[1:14:31] want to read
[1:14:41] together first Thessalonians
[1:14:57] 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:15:00] 5 verse
[1:15:03] 1 but of the times and the seasons
[1:15:05] Brethren you have no need that I write
[1:15:07] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[1:15:09] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[1:15:11] thief in the night for when they shall
[1:15:13] say peace and safety then sudden
[1:15:15] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:15:17] upon a woman with child they shall not
[1:15:20] Escape but ye Brethren are not in
[1:15:22] darkness that that day should overtake
[1:15:23] you as a thief ye are children of the
[1:15:26] light and the children of the day we are
[1:15:29] not of the night nor of the
[1:15:32] darkness amen you don't have to be
[1:15:34] afraid you're not going to catch the
[1:15:36] Rapture the Rapture is going on now the
[1:15:38] rapture's already caught
[1:15:42] you just keep walking with the
[1:15:45] Lord I don't care if it's 40 more years
[1:15:48] or 60 more years just keep walking with
[1:15:50] the Lord walk with the voice that has
[1:15:53] returned in our day
[1:15:55] walk with the Lord his presence is here
[1:15:58] he wants to walk with his bride and the
[1:16:00] bride can walk with the word but she
[1:16:02] must be in agreement with the word
[1:16:04] there's got to be a revelation that says
[1:16:06] that ain't nothing but the truth brother
[1:16:09] Brandon
[1:16:11] amen praise God and then our lives must
[1:16:14] come in harmony with this word why did
[1:16:16] it take Enoch 300 years Amen to take to
[1:16:20] take a Rapture Hey listen I don't have
[1:16:22] all the answers and I can't tell you but
[1:16:24] one thing I know that when his faith got
[1:16:26] to the place he was
[1:16:28] gone because by faith he was translated
[1:16:31] amen I don't know if it took 300 years I
[1:16:33] don't know if he had to spend a couple
[1:16:34] of th hundred of those on the pyramid
[1:16:36] first I don't know what was going on but
[1:16:38] I do know this that he was translated by
[1:16:42] faith amen and all that time walking
[1:16:45] with the Lord certainly can't hinder
[1:16:48] your faith all that time walking with
[1:16:51] the the the person of the word listen he
[1:16:54] knew the word he knew the revelation of
[1:16:56] the word amen and he put it in stone
[1:16:58] form so that stone was reflecting the
[1:17:00] word but what is the word the word is
[1:17:03] Jesus Christ he had the revelation of
[1:17:07] Christ and so what was he walking with
[1:17:09] he was walking with the person he had
[1:17:11] put in
[1:17:13] stone was real and living and
[1:17:16] fellowshipping with him and he was
[1:17:17] walking with that
[1:17:21] voice and then the Lord took him he was
[1:17:25] not for the Lord took him but Hebrews
[1:17:28] tells us by faith he was translated
[1:17:33] amen here's what brother brandom
[1:17:37] says says this all the way back in 1954
[1:17:41] he says Enoch one day walked in walked
[1:17:43] like that he says there many places but
[1:17:46] you know what he done he walked all the
[1:17:48] way home with God got so far up the road
[1:17:51] he didn't want to come back anymore
[1:17:56] listen let's take everything we've been
[1:17:58] talking about tonight and put it
[1:18:01] together Enoch was the seventh from Adam
[1:18:04] foreshadowing the seventh Church age
[1:18:06] bride running
[1:18:09] parallel the seventh from Adam got a
[1:18:11] revelation of the whole word and proved
[1:18:14] it by writing the Bible in the
[1:18:17] pyramid and he walked with the Lord for
[1:18:20] hundreds of
[1:18:22] years and fellowship and Harmony and and
[1:18:25] and how can two walk together L be
[1:18:26] agreed he must be agreed with the word
[1:18:28] he was revealed to
[1:18:29] [Music]
[1:18:31] him and after walking with the Lord so
[1:18:34] many years he was not for the Lord took
[1:18:37] him but he but Hebrews tells us but by
[1:18:40] faith he was
[1:18:43] translated and then brother Brenham
[1:18:45] tells us that the Rapture will be a
[1:18:47] revelation to the
[1:18:50] bride so when you put it all together
[1:18:53] here's the man that's got the revelation
[1:18:55] of the word he's walking with the word
[1:18:58] his life is reflecting the Revelation
[1:19:00] that he has he's living it out he became
[1:19:03] the word made flesh for his age right
[1:19:05] amen he's fleshing it out walking with
[1:19:08] the Lord for 300 years but at some point
[1:19:11] brother bham says he got so far down the
[1:19:15] road yeah yeah listen I I don't believe
[1:19:20] that we're talking physical distance
[1:19:25] right I don't believe he got so far away
[1:19:27] that somehow while walking with the Lord
[1:19:30] on Earth he was now closer to Heaven
[1:19:32] than he was his
[1:19:36] house but he had got so far in his
[1:19:39] journey in the word and Revelation in
[1:19:41] the word and his walk with the Lord he
[1:19:44] had come so far till all of a sudden it
[1:19:46] hit him I don't have to go back I don't
[1:19:49] have to go back home I don't have to go

[1:21:43] bride let's walk with
[1:21:46] God who's going to be caught up in that
[1:21:50] translation the amateur
[1:21:52] Gods they're going to take a translation
[1:21:55] cuz by faith they'll take a
[1:21:58] translation you know there was a time
[1:22:00] that Jesus when he was crucified he went
[1:22:02] to preach to the souls that were in
[1:22:04] hell and who was he preaching to brother
[1:22:06] B dramatizes it we can find in the
[1:22:08] scriptures but he comes down and he
[1:22:10] preached to those who were disobedient
[1:22:12] some days disobedient in the days of
[1:22:15] Noah what does that mean that means they
[1:22:17] didn't believe the
[1:22:19] word so he comes down there and brother
[1:22:21] Brenham dramatizes the whole thing amen
[1:22:24] but he begins to show that he comes down
[1:22:26] and says I was what Noah was preaching
[1:22:28] about I was what Daniel was saying I was
[1:22:31] and then he comes over to the elect
[1:22:33] group that believed him in their day
[1:22:36] first he shows himself to the ones who
[1:22:38] rejected the word in their day and he
[1:22:40] come to show himself as the word that
[1:22:42] they were preaching in that day I'm the
