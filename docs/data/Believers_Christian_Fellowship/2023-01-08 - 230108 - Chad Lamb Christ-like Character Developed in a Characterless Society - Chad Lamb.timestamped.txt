[15:48] Lord
[15:50] Part of Yourself Lord that's magnetized
[15:52] to you
[15:53] and as you come near Lord there's
[15:56] something in us that just wants to draw
[15:58] nearer to you we love you Lord because
[16:01] you first loved us God as we turn our
[16:04] hearts in this service Lord to looking
[16:06] at your word I pray
[16:08] that you would just take control take
[16:11] control of these lips of clay speak your
[16:13] words of eternal life mold us into your
[16:16] very image and make us in your very
[16:17] likeness Lord shape Us by the sword of
[16:20] your word but we ask that you would take
[16:22] everything that's unlike you
[16:25] untrue to the desire you have for us may
[16:28] you remove it from us now
[16:30] and God made what's left be the
[16:32] reflection of yourself that you wanted
[16:34] in this age
[16:35] pray you take this word Lord and feed it
[16:38] to us by your own hand
[16:40] and give us the portion Lord that you've
[16:42] allotted for this day that we have need
[16:43] of law

[16:55] control Lord I yield myself to you and

[18:44] him in my arms because I stand as your
[18:46] representative to dedicate him back to
[18:49] you Lord
[18:50] God that they would recognize where his
[18:53] life came from and that they dedicate
[18:56] themselves to raise him and the fear and
[18:58] ammunition of you Lord that he may know
[19:00] you lord lord I pray as they dedicate
[19:03] themselves and dedicate Dawson back to

[19:28] Jesus Christ's name amen
[19:32] bless you both
[19:35] praise God God bless you guys
[19:38] amen
[19:43] praise the Lord
[19:45] I also wanted to take a minute and
[19:48] announce a birth of a baby
[19:50] so Thursday uh Thursday morning brother
[19:53] ilian sister Natasha should lose enough
[19:55] had a little baby born little Marcus
[19:57] Ilya losing off amen so God God be
[20:01] praised for that but we don't have a
[20:03] picture to show you because little
[20:04] Marcus was just a little bit early and
[20:07] his lungs were not as developed as they
[20:09] like so he had to go to special care
[20:11] right away in the hospital there and
[20:13] yesterday they decided to transport him
[20:15] to Toledo Hospital so he's in the Toledo
[20:18] Hospital now so we want to pray for them
[20:20] I talked to Ilia today and they said
[20:22] Marcus is improving he's stable he's not
[20:25] in critical condition he's not in danger
[20:27] they just want to give him some oxygen
[20:29] because his lungs aren't as developed as
[20:31] they'd like but he said last night he
[20:34] improved through the night and he's
[20:35] they've reduced were able to reduce a
[20:37] little bit his oxygen level so we want
[20:39] to pray together that that God will give
[20:43] him strength to his lungs that'll absorb
[20:45] oxygen that he can go home I know all
[20:48] they want to do is get everybody home
[20:49] together amen so we're excited for the
[20:52] birth of little Marcus but we really
[20:54] would like to see them get home let's
[20:56] all stand together and I'd like to just
[20:59] pray together for little Marcus and for
[21:02] Ilya and Natasha it's a little bit
[21:04] difficult being separated dad trying to
[21:06] take care of the little kids and family
[21:07] helping and get up to be with Mom and
[21:09] Toledo so it's I'm sure a stressful time
[21:12] for them so it was an assembly we want
[21:14] to want to pray for them so let's bow
[21:16] our heads together
[21:18] their Heavenly Father Lord we thank you
[21:20] so much what a privilege it is Lord to
[21:23] see the dedication of a baby that you've
[21:26] given Lord to a couple in the assembly
[21:28] now we Rejoice with them over the over
[21:30] that birth and now the birth of little
[21:32] Marcus Lord and we're so excited for
[21:35] about the Ilion sister Natasha so happy
[21:37] for them
[21:38] and Lord the doctors are wanting to help
[21:40] little Marcus and his lungs need to
[21:42] develop a bit but God you have it all
[21:44] under control you know all things and
[21:47] there's nothing out of kilter with you
[21:49] and God we just pray that you would help
[21:51] him now that you would give strength
[21:53] into those little set of lungs for you
[21:55] created all lungs you've created his
[21:57] lungs I pray that he would continue to
[21:59] improve throughout the day Lord they'd
[22:00] be able to wean him off of oxygen soon
[22:02] that he'd be able to go home Lord with
[22:05] with the recognition that you have done
[22:07] all things well Perry did you bring this
[22:09] family back together I've read you
[22:11] strength in brother Ilya sister Natasha
[22:13] just re-strengthened them Lord let your
[22:16] Supernatural presence be with them and
[22:18] may they feel your presence with them
[22:19] may you may their faith stay high and I
[22:22] pray that all things will work together
[22:24] for your glory and may there be a
[22:26] tremendous testimony of what you've done
[22:28] for them as well we love you Lord we ask
[22:31] you blessings now in Jesus Christ's name
[22:33] amen and while you're standing let's
[22:37] turn to the Book of Revelation Nation
[22:38] chapter 3 and we'll begin there
[22:41] also we want to remember sister Tammy
[22:43] Mills at the loss of her father brother
[22:45] Robert Douglas amen we all know brother
[22:47] Robert really well he was a tremendous
[22:49] brother and so I'm sure they've got a
[22:51] lot of arrangements to make funeral
[22:52] arrangements and plans and it's a busy
[22:55] time and may God bless sister Tammy she
[22:57] helps her mother with all of that as we
[22:59] get the details we'll send those out and
[23:01] make them available also I almost forgot
[23:05] I want to say happy birthday to Brother

[23:12] that amen
[23:14] but uh I missed on Wednesday I missed
[23:16] brother Ben siebold so his birthday was
[23:18] Wednesday and I think Griffin shorts was
[23:20] too so I missed those so God bless you
[23:22] all happy birthday to you all amen we
[23:25] won't sing right now we'll sing to Kyle
[23:27] later amen
[23:29] but uh it's a good day it's a good day
[23:31] to be together we look at Revelation
[23:34] chapter 3 verse 14.
[23:41] thank you and unto the angel of the
[23:44] Church of the laodiceans right these
[23:46] things saith the amen the faithful and
[23:48] true witness the beginning of the
[23:50] creation of God I Know Thy works that
[23:53] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[23:55] thou were cold or hot so then because
[23:57] Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[23:59] hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[24:01] because thou sayest I am rich and
[24:04] increased with goods and have need of
[24:06] nothing and knoweth not that thou art
[24:08] wretched and miserable and poor and
[24:11] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[24:14] me gold tried in the fire that them may
[24:16] as be rich in white raiment the thou
[24:19] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[24:21] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[24:23] thine eyes with eyes have that thou
[24:25] mayest see as many as I love I rebuke
[24:28] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[24:31] repent amen God bless you as you have
[24:33] your seats
[24:36] I also want to say I appreciated the
[24:37] song special very much God bless you all
[24:39] and thank you for that
[24:42] amen as we look this scripture I want to
[24:44] I want to take for a title
[24:46] uh christ-like character developed in a
[24:50] characterless society
[24:52] was kind of wordy don't normally do that
[24:55] but it sounded good this time
[24:56] christ-like character developed in a
[24:59] characterless society
[25:01] and when we look at the laodicean church
[25:04] age this description of the laodicean
[25:06] church age
[25:07] we find out that that verse 17 he says
[25:10] because thou sayest I am rich and
[25:12] increased with goods and have need of
[25:14] nothing this is the condition that that
[25:17] the people believe that they're in this
[25:19] is their this is the the height of
[25:21] deception through the church ages has
[25:23] gotten to the the God of this evil age
[25:26] have so deceived the people and deceive
[25:28] their minds that they believe in this
[25:32] last age that they are
[25:35] rich and increased with goods and have
[25:39] need of nothing but God the way God
[25:42] views them he says know us thou not that
[25:45] thou art wretched and miserable poor
[25:47] blind and naked so they are wretched and
[25:51] miserable poor blind and naked but they
[25:53] are completely unaware of it they
[25:55] absolutely believe within themselves
[25:58] that they are rich and increased with
[25:59] goods and have need of nothing they
[26:01] don't know that they're spiritually
[26:03] needy they think they're sound
[26:06] now to me this is absolute deception in
[26:08] the laodicean church age that the church
[26:11] is absolutely completely deceived
[26:15] and so the and we find that the the
[26:17] whole age is is in this kind of
[26:19] deception the environment which we find
[26:21] ourselves in and that we live in is
[26:24] absolutely lost its mind and thinks it's
[26:27] intelligent
[26:28] the world has lost its mind Brothers
[26:31] said they would go completely insane
[26:34] but they wouldn't know it in fact that
[26:36] they would call evil good and good evil
[26:39] they would get into the time where
[26:40] everything is topsy-turvy where the
[26:42] things that they think are good are
[26:44] actually evil and the things that they
[26:46] call evil are things that are actually
[26:48] good they have the world has gone
[26:50] totally insane they have completely lost
[26:53] their minds but the deception the thing
[26:55] that's so deceiving in this age is that
[26:57] they think everything's fine that man is
[26:59] intelligent that we are we are we are
[27:02] moral that we have uh uh all kinds I
[27:05] mean it's it's so ludicrous that the
[27:08] same society that will kill unborn
[27:11] babies amen will fight for humanitarian
[27:13] rights
[27:15] so we're fighting for humanitarian
[27:17] rights but we're we're we're we're
[27:21] killing the right to become a human
[27:23] being to live and breathe uh uh and to
[27:26] be born into the world so we're fighting
[27:28] for humanitarian rights but refusing the
[27:31] most basic concept of humanity which is
[27:34] life
[27:35] so I mean this is the world that we live
[27:38] in they're absolutely lost their minds
[27:40] uh uh but but to challenge that or to
[27:44] say anything against it than the people
[27:46] who are challenging that are the ones
[27:47] who are ignorant
[27:49] and and I'll tell you right offhand I'm
[27:52] ignorant when it comes to the ways of
[27:55] the world when it comes to uh the
[27:57] philosophy of our modern day Society I'm
[28:00] absolutely ignorant I'm not schooled in
[28:01] and I don't understand it it doesn't
[28:03] make any sense to me amen but but the
[28:06] thing that I want to know is what the
[28:08] society not what Society thinks or the
[28:10] the social Norm I want to know what the
[28:12] word of God says because that's sanity
[28:14] that's reality that is the real reality
[28:17] everything else is absolutely absurd
[28:21] and the laodicean church age brother Ben
[28:24] says uh he says notice now the name
[28:26] laodicea is the people's rights are
[28:30] Justice of the people
[28:32] was there ever an age like the 20th
[28:35] century Church age that has seen all
[28:37] nations rise up and demand equality
[28:39] socially and financially I mean it's a
[28:43] it's an age of people's rights so I
[28:46] don't have to do that it's my right I
[28:49] can do this and I can do that but we
[28:51] know it's an age of total deception and
[28:54] this is an evil age
[28:57] so it's
[28:59] the the whole concept of people's rights
[29:01] is absolutely contrary to the whole idea
[29:05] of the Bible
[29:07] because the whole concept of the Bible
[29:09] is people who will give up their rights
[29:12] and surrender themselves to God
[29:14] so the whole concept is a yielding to
[29:17] the word of God Amen but the whole the
[29:19] whole design of laodicea the whole
[29:22] concept of this last day is for people
[29:25] to take their own rights over the word
[29:28] of God
[29:29] to not have to obey to not have to
[29:32] listen to be able to do their own thing
[29:33] and so let's go look at Luke chapter 9.
[29:37] I'm just going slow to set a foundation
[29:40] for for what we want to look at
[29:45] Luke chapter 9.
[29:52] let's begin in Luke 9 verse 23.
[30:00] and he said to them all If any man will
[30:03] come after me let him deny himself and
[30:06] take up his cross daily and follow me
[30:08] for whosoever will save his life shall
[30:10] lose it but whosoever will lose his life
[30:12] for my sake the same shall save him for
[30:15] what is a man an advantage if he gain
[30:17] the whole world and lose himself or be
[30:19] Cast Away so we see Jesus is telling us
[30:23] that any man will come after me let him
[30:25] deny himself this is the opposite of
[30:27] laodicean rhetoric
[30:29] this is a complete the The Words of
[30:32] Christ are absolutely contrary to the
[30:34] modern era and the thinking of the
[30:35] modern day let him deny himself and take
[30:38] up his cross daily I love this I love
[30:41] this passage this is repeated similarly
[30:44] in other gospels but I love it here
[30:45] because it says take up his cross daily
[30:48] and follow me this is not a one-time
[30:50] decision we made one time long ago but
[30:53] this is a daily taking up a cross amen
[30:56] and what is the cross used for the cross
[30:59] is used for sacrifice it is used for uh
[31:02] uh death it's a it's an instrument of
[31:04] punishment to slay somebody on so the
[31:07] whole idea of bearing a cross is that
[31:10] you die on the cross amen that you're
[31:12] nailed to the cross and this is the
[31:14] place of death amen so now to to Die
[31:18] daily to take your cross to deny
[31:20] yourself and take your cross daily means
[31:23] to die to self and stay in that
[31:26] condition of dying to self and denying
[31:28] self amen and then then follow him
[31:31] so he says if you will save your life
[31:33] you shall lose it but if you will lose
[31:36] your life for my sake the same shall
[31:39] save it
[31:41] amen so now we find that that the whole
[31:45] concept is contrary
[31:48] to laodicea
[31:51] for the the Apostle Paul said in First
[31:53] Corinthians I Die daily so he caught
[31:55] this concept that he had to Die daily
[31:59] and the message forsaking all the
[32:01] problems said what else did Jesus do he
[32:04] gave and forsook his own life he gave
[32:05] his life to save yours and mine because
[32:08] that he gave his life he didn't have to
[32:11] lay it down he'd done it willingly
[32:14] he didn't have to do it but he done it
[32:16] willingly because he could save you now
[32:19] this whole point is just setting up the
[32:22] setting in the face of what Jesus did
[32:24] the example that he set for us was
[32:27] absolutely contrary to laodicea he
[32:30] brother remember said he didn't have to
[32:31] die that way he could have continued
[32:33] living as a man he could have married
[32:35] and he could have raised children
[32:38] but he he willingly surrendered to the
[32:41] word of God and to the will of God and
[32:43] gave himself a sacrifice for you and I
[32:46] so Jesus set the standard by example how
[32:49] we should live now laodicea is painting
[32:52] a completely contrary picture to that
[32:54] picture that Christ said amen but he
[32:57] gave us the example how we should live
[32:59] and Christ is the mystery of God
[33:01] revealed he says but when Christ is
[33:02] identified in you identifying himself
[33:05] then you are christ-like so we are not
[33:08] like the world but we are christ-like so
[33:11] we look at what Christ did and we do the
[33:13] same thing
[33:15] you're a christ-like which the word
[33:17] Christian means to be christ-like there
[33:19] is your identification all right now and
[33:22] since he is our identification then we
[33:24] should be identified with him by living
[33:27] for him
[33:28] so now he's our identification that's
[33:31] our identification to be Christian to be
[33:33] christ-like to be like Christ so what
[33:36] was Christ like amen he was
[33:38] self-sacrificing
[33:40] he he submitted himself to the will of
[33:43] the father in all ways and we are
[33:45] supposed to be christ-like not
[33:47] laodicean-like
[33:49] either but it's that simple we know that
[33:51] I know we know that amen I I I'm not
[33:53] trying to bring anything new what I'm
[33:55] trying to do is get us in the right
[33:57] frame of mind to live in the world we
[33:59] live in
[34:01] because every other message we pick up
[34:03] outside of this word gives us a totally
[34:06] different picture
[34:08] and because we live in that atmosphere I
[34:11] mean we live in an atmosphere where
[34:12] employers cannot fire their employees
[34:17] we live in an atmosphere I mean when I
[34:21] worked it was absolutely amazing the
[34:23] people I worked with they would get so
[34:25] angry and so upset every time the boss
[34:29] gave a requirement I need you guys to
[34:31] start filling out this form here's an
[34:33] extra piece of paper we got to fill out
[34:34] I want you to start taking pictures of
[34:36] repairs and then people would blow up
[34:38] and why I don't have to do this and and
[34:40] I'm saying he's paying you
[34:43] he's he's giving you money
[34:46] and you agreed that I if you give me
[34:49] money I'll do what you say I'll work for
[34:51] you why are you so angry
[34:54] it's not like he knocked on your door
[34:56] and said hey you come here and you no
[34:58] you went to him and asked for a job
[35:01] and you you get the paycheck every
[35:03] whatever pay period is and and he's the
[35:06] boss he's the one with the money he's
[35:08] the one who's doing the paying he's the
[35:10] one who gets to make up the rules
[35:14] but laodicey is so pervasive that
[35:18] mentality that you have employers who
[35:20] blow up every time there's another
[35:22] request made and re they refuse to do it
[35:26] I'm not doing that and if you work in a
[35:29] union shop it's a thousand times worse
[35:34] why because this is the laodicean
[35:37] mentality
[35:39] we all know that
[35:40] but the the problem is this mentality
[35:43] Creeps in
[35:45] and it's all around us and it can creep
[35:48] into our families and our homes it can
[35:50] creep in it can creep into churches it
[35:52] can creep in and all of a sudden we
[35:54] don't realize amen that I'm not the boss
[35:57] I don't make up the rules God's the boss
[36:00] he makes up the rules it's his word it's
[36:03] not my idea it's his idea and what I
[36:06] want to do is be christ-like it means
[36:09] whatever the word is I'm subject to that
[36:15] so that's our identification
[36:18] let's look at Ephesians chapter 3.
[36:33] Ephesians chapter 3.
[36:35] verse 1.
[36:41] Ephesians 3 and 1 for this cause I Paul
[36:45] the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
[36:47] gentiles
[36:48] brother man talks about this how Paul
[36:51] called himself a prisoner of Jesus
[36:53] Christ and we know that that Paul was a
[36:57] voluntary prisoner of Jesus Christ
[36:59] and you can argue and say no you know no
[37:01] he wasn't he was he was held captive by
[37:03] the Romans Hey listen it was voluntary
[37:06] for one his attitude was he was a love
[37:09] slave he was a prisoner to Jesus Christ
[37:11] and his entire imprisonment was based on
[37:14] his free choice
[37:17] amen
[37:18] in the message of prisoner he says now
[37:20] you could hardly imagine Paul regarding
[37:22] himself a prisoner a Born Free Man
[37:25] filled with the Holy Spirit but yet he
[37:28] calls himself a prisoner
[37:30] this whole approach and this whole
[37:32] attitude Paul had he was a prisoner of
[37:35] the Lord Jesus Christ he was subject he
[37:38] was a love slave Bound by chains of love
[37:41] to Christ and and he was and he
[37:44] confesses Paul confesses Amen to the to
[37:47] the governor that he was Freeborn
[37:49] and he says and and I think it was the
[37:52] Centurion maybe I don't remember who
[37:53] said how were you born I obtained this
[37:56] at a great Psalm he says I Was Born Free
[37:58] so in the in the as a Roman citizen he
[38:01] was born free and there he had certain
[38:03] rights that gave him certain rights
[38:06] but Paul was willing to give up those
[38:09] rights to serve Christ it wasn't now
[38:11] about being a Roman citizen it wasn't
[38:12] any more about being a Jew he gave it
[38:15] all up and he counted his Heritage and
[38:17] all of his accomplishment as done that
[38:19] he might win Christ because he was a
[38:21] prisoner of Jesus Christ not by force
[38:24] but willingly
[38:26] he he there was brother remember said he
[38:29] was bound in Chains of Love chains of
[38:32] Love are invisible chains there was no
[38:34] physical circumstance by which God held
[38:37] him he wasn't held by social constraints
[38:41] sometimes I wonder how many people are
[38:44] prisoners of Jesus Christ because all
[38:47] their family or their spouse or their
[38:48] parents believe a certain way so they
[38:50] believe a certain way and they're held
[38:52] by chains of social constraints
[38:55] they're held by chains of human love
[38:58] they're held by chains of the the the
[39:01] social Gathering that they gather in
[39:03] amen but those chains will break they're
[39:06] not tough enough to hold under every
[39:08] circumstance but chains of Love true
[39:11] love to Christ in a voluntary
[39:13] enslavement
[39:16] and and this is I mean he's a prisoner
[39:19] with no bars he's a prisoner with no
[39:21] cell he's a prisoner with no lock and no
[39:24] key amen he's the best kind of prisoner
[39:26] anybody could ever have amen because
[39:28] he's a prisoner that will never Escape
[39:29] he doesn't want to escape
[39:32] he's a prisoner who's not going to flee
[39:33] when you leave the door you don't need a
[39:35] door he's there because he wants to be
[39:37] there
[39:39] so it's he's a willing prisoner of Jesus
[39:41] Christ
[39:43] by his own desire
[39:45] let's go to First Corinthians 9.
[39:54] First Corinthians 9 and 24.
[40:06] First Corinthians 9 and 24 know you not
[40:08] the day which run in a race run all
[40:11] but one receiveth the prize
[40:13] so run that you may obtain
[40:16] and every man that striveth for the
[40:18] Mastery is tempered in all things now
[40:20] they do it to obtain a corruptable crown
[40:22] but we an incorruptable i therefore so
[40:25] run not as uncertain so fight I not as
[40:27] one that beat at the air but I keep
[40:29] under my body and bring it into
[40:31] subjection lest that by any means when I
[40:33] have preached to others I myself should
[40:36] be a Castaway
[40:38] the so when you when you look at the
[40:40] scripture nobody nobody had to check on
[40:44] Paul
[40:45] nobody he didn't need a buddy system to
[40:49] be a believer
[40:51] he didn't need an accountability partner
[40:53] to get him through
[40:56] Paul because he recognized I'm running
[40:59] for a prize
[41:01] I I there's something to be gained
[41:04] there's something there's a goal that I
[41:06] have I want to live for Christ I want to
[41:08] win Christ and live for Christ amen all
[41:12] of those things are his motivation he's
[41:15] not motivated by peer pressure he's not
[41:17] motivated uh we used to say it like this
[41:20] he's not motivated by domineering
[41:22] personalities
[41:24] he's not dumb dumb he's not dominated by
[41:27] harsh hard preaching he's not dominated
[41:31] by a strict sector or a strict guideline
[41:34] that's enforced by a group of people
[41:37] what's holding what's holding Paul
[41:40] what's holding him through stonings
[41:42] what's holding him through beatings
[41:43] what's holding him through rejection
[41:45] what's holding him when his friends
[41:46] leave him what's holding him when
[41:48] Barnabas separates when Demas leaves
[41:50] what's holding him so fast to the word
[41:53] amen it's his own love and his own
[41:55] desire and his own willingness to
[41:57] surrender and it's a stronger Bond than
[42:00] any other bond that has ever been on the
[42:02] face of the Earth
[42:05] is Paul willing to endure such
[42:08] difficulties but never give up
[42:11] have him face such rejection and
[42:14] hardship but never throw in the towel
[42:16] never quit being a Believer never Paul
[42:19] listen Paul went through so much but you
[42:22] never saw Paul take a break from church
[42:27] because he was hurt or wounded or
[42:28] rejected or
[42:31] he never took a break from God
[42:34] and just kind of just kind of took a
[42:37] break from this Christian Life for just
[42:40] no for him it wasn't that kind of a
[42:43] thing amen it was the desire of his
[42:45] heart I mean it was his whole life it
[42:47] was everything he wanted and he
[42:48] willfully surrendered himself to it and
[42:51] bound himself in Chains of love he
[42:53] wasn't looking for separation he was
[42:55] looking to give all he wasn't looking
[42:56] for it easier he was looking for the he
[42:59] was looking for a way to serve God with
[43:00] all of his life
[43:03] what an example to us I I want to live
[43:06] that way
[43:08] and so now I I want to uh dive into
[43:11] where I'm really wanting to go there's
[43:14] been a quote that I've read or I've
[43:15] quoted off the top of my head the last
[43:17] few services but I wanted to take time
[43:19] and go through it we'll get to that just
[43:20] in a minute but first I want to read a
[43:23] quote out of the church age book from
[43:24] the latest in church age
[43:26] but there is a gold of God First Peter 1
[43:29] 7 says the trial of your faith being
[43:31] much more precious than of gold that
[43:33] perisheth
[43:34] the gold of God is a christ-like
[43:36] character produced in the fiery furnace
[43:38] of affliction
[43:40] that is the right kind of gold
[43:43] but what kind of gold does the church
[43:45] have today it has but the worldly gold
[43:48] that will perish it is Rich it is
[43:51] complacent it has made affluence the
[43:53] major Criterion of spirituality the
[43:55] evidence of God's blessing and the
[43:57] correctness of Doctrine Etc is now based
[43:59] upon how many Rich folks are involved in
[44:01] it
[44:03] you had better come you you had better
[44:05] come before it's too late saith the Lord
[44:07] and buy of me gold tried in the fire and
[44:10] then you will be truly rich
[44:12] are you getting it listen to me naked
[44:15] physically we came into the world but
[44:16] naked spiritually we will not leave it
[44:18] oh no we are going to take something
[44:21] with us and what that something is is
[44:24] all we can take with us nothing less
[44:26] nothing more so we had better be real
[44:29] careful now to see that we take
[44:31] something that will make us right before
[44:32] God so then what will we take with us we
[44:35] will take our character
[44:38] brother that is what we will take with
[44:40] us now what kind of character will you
[44:43] take with you will it be the little to
[44:46] be like his whose character was molded
[44:48] by suffering in the fiery furnace of
[44:50] Affliction or will it be the softness of
[44:53] this characterless laodicean people
[44:56] it is up to each one of us for in that
[44:58] day every man will bear his own burden
[45:03] so what kind of character we have will
[45:06] it be the character that's like the
[45:08] world or will it be the character that's
[45:10] like his that's molded in the fiery
[45:12] furnace of affliction
[45:14] and and
[45:17] I want to look at that fiery furnace of
[45:19] Affliction the way our character is
[45:21] molded in just a minute so hold on to
[45:24] that term but again in the church age
[45:27] from the thyart iron Church age section
[45:29] he says the word for burden is weight or
[45:32] pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages
[45:34] was either Bend or be broken
[45:37] so in the Dark Ages there was a totally
[45:40] different environment than the one we
[45:41] live in now
[45:43] would you agree they're about polar
[45:45] opposite
[45:46] in the Dark Ages it was under the
[45:48] constraints of the Jezebel spirit she
[45:50] had come to complete power ruling over
[45:52] Nations and kings and and and so now you
[45:56] either bow to the Catholic system or you
[45:59] died
[46:00] there was a real pressure there in the
[46:02] Dark Ages and you know what character
[46:05] was manifested a true character was
[46:07] manifested in that circumstance because
[46:10] there was no options amen there was no
[46:12] hiding there was no pretending amen
[46:14] there weren't a lot of pretend Believers
[46:17] in that day
[46:18] when you were giving your life when
[46:20] families were being separated when your
[46:22] children were being taken from you all
[46:24] for believing the word amen there was
[46:26] not a lot of pretend Christians in that
[46:28] day and those who who were true
[46:30] Christians their character was developed
[46:32] and also displayed because of the
[46:36] environment that they were in
[46:39] it was an environment conducive to
[46:42] character it's for the displaying
[46:43] character
[46:45] see so the the pressure was Bend or be
[46:49] broken bow or die it was the Inquisition
[46:52] the power of the Empire backing up
[46:54] satanic worship
[46:56] be organized or pay with your life each
[46:59] age had its pressures for example a
[47:02] great burden of the last age is the
[47:04] pressure of riches and soft-living
[47:07] we live in a different time
[47:09] the great burden of the last age is the
[47:11] pressure of riches soft living and
[47:13] nervous tensions and a complex age that
[47:16] that was that we seem unfit to live in
[47:19] that's the trial and this the the burden
[47:22] of the last day is the pressure of
[47:24] riches soft living and nervous tensions
[47:27] and a complex age that we seem unfit to
[47:29] live in
[47:31] I feel unfit to live in this complex age
[47:34] as a human being I mean not not as a
[47:37] child of God I was born for this age but
[47:39] just on a human perspective things are
[47:41] moving at such a pace I don't think
[47:43] Humanity in general as a human beings
[47:46] with the natural genetic human being
[47:49] with a brain and eyes and hearing and
[47:51] senses of touch and hear I don't think
[47:53] they were meant to live in this kind of
[47:54] environment they're getting stressed out
[47:56] to the max amen we have people that are
[47:59] are with all kinds of anxiety issues
[48:01] there are all kinds of depression
[48:03] anxiety clinical critical mental
[48:07] illnesses you have people who are in
[48:09] depression amen and and they haven't
[48:12] ever missed a meal they don't have any
[48:15] major death in their family there's no
[48:16] major illness around them but they're
[48:18] absolutely depressed good jobs making
[48:20] good money living in good houses driving
[48:22] good cars and they're completely
[48:23] depressed
[48:24] you have people with severe anxiety and
[48:27] worry amen and there's nothing wrong
[48:29] there's absolutely nothing wrong in life
[48:33] but what it is is our brains are being
[48:35] short-circuited by all the information
[48:37] and the environment and everything
[48:38] that's going on around us amen everybody
[48:41] is on sensory overload
[48:44] and the and the hardware is crashing
[48:50] so the burden of this last age is the
[48:52] nervous tension but also the pressure of
[48:55] riches
[48:57] you see the pressure of riches
[48:59] yeah it doesn't take long when you've
[49:03] been blessed and you have blessed and
[49:05] financial blessings in your life it
[49:07] doesn't take long till you realize I
[49:09] don't know how much stuff owns me or how
[49:11] much I own stuff
[49:14] because everything requires upkeep
[49:16] maintenance it requires and then it
[49:19] requires protection amen you buy it then
[49:22] you buy an insurance policy so you can't
[49:23] lose it
[49:25] then you lock it up so it doesn't get
[49:27] stolen you have insurance in case it
[49:28] gets wrecked and then you have to do all
[49:30] the maintenance and the tires and the
[49:32] and the wiper blades and the battery and
[49:34] the blah blah blah and then I don't want
[49:36] this investment to get ruined so I got
[49:38] to build a garage and I can park it in
[49:40] the garage and you know what it was
[49:42] simpler to have nothing
[49:46] so there's a pressure of soft living a
[49:48] pressure of riches and it doesn't take
[49:50] long till we become slaves to materials
[49:55] to material Goods
[49:57] then we then we work to keep the things
[50:00] going
[50:02] so we work to gather the things then we
[50:04] work to keep the things going
[50:08] I say oh
[50:10] it'll be a glad day when we get free
[50:12] from this system
[50:15] but this is where God planted us
[50:18] and it's here in this age of soft living
[50:21] in this characterless layout to see an
[50:24] age it's here that he wants us to
[50:26] develop christ-like character
[50:29] it's in the epitome of Easy Living and
[50:33] pleasure-ridden Madness and and
[50:35] self-serving every agenda is
[50:38] self-serving in the midst of selfishness
[50:40] and self-love and and
[50:42] self-glorification and self-pacification
[50:45] it's in that environment that he wants
[50:47] us to have christ-like character
[50:49] not in the Dark Ages when You Face Down
[50:52] the B system and it's either live or die
[50:55] no it's now we're in a completely
[50:57] different area where now you can have
[51:00] anything you want and you can live any
[51:01] way you want and it's in this atmosphere
[51:04] he wants to mold a christ-like character
[51:06] in US
[51:07] amen
[51:09] so there's a burden
[51:11] of pressures of riches soft-living and
[51:15] nervous tension
[51:17] so but he says that the character is
[51:20] molded
[51:22] uh we'll look at this way uh this
[51:24] previous quote his character
[51:26] whose character was molded by suffering
[51:28] in the fiery furnace of affliction
[51:31] you start thinking you know what is the
[51:34] fiery furnace of Affliction they're not
[51:35] arresting me and Hauling me out of my
[51:37] house for believing the message
[51:40] I've not been refused employment because
[51:42] I'm a Christian
[51:44] not yet
[51:47] and so
[51:48] but when we look down through time let's
[51:51] just take Paul for instance
[51:53] Paul
[51:55] if he would have remained as he was
[51:58] Paul had life I mean he had a good life
[52:02] he had he had uh made some achievements
[52:05] he was respected he was educated he was
[52:08] part of the system and he was such a
[52:10] part of the system that he had at least
[52:12] a voice with the high priest they knew
[52:14] who he was and they gave him letters to
[52:16] Damascus to go to go hold him so he had
[52:18] confidence of the religious leaders he
[52:20] was a a Freeborn I mean in the society
[52:24] he lived in he had the best of
[52:25] everything
[52:26] he was a binge of mind he was a Pharisee
[52:28] he was in good with the religious
[52:30] leaders but he was also a Roman citizen
[52:32] like he was the best of both sides
[52:35] he was a Roman citizen which gave him
[52:37] certain rights and he was in good with
[52:38] the the priesthood and he was a student
[52:40] of gamalia so he got certain rights
[52:42] there and he had rights here and he had
[52:43] rights here and he had privileges there
[52:45] and he had proof he had everything kind
[52:46] of going for him so what were where was
[52:49] he going to get molded christ-like
[52:51] character where was his fiery furnace of
[52:54] Affliction it came when in spite of all
[52:57] of that and without him having to he
[52:59] chose to take the word and leave all of
[53:01] that behind
[53:03] and when he chose to take the word then
[53:06] Affliction began
[53:08] then rejection began then then all of
[53:12] this stuff friends moving away and
[53:13] accusations and and stonings all of it
[53:17] started when he of his own will amen
[53:20] chose to follow the word to follow
[53:22] Christ and leave everything else and he
[53:25] entered into the fiery furnace of
[53:27] Affliction voluntarily
[53:31] I mean he could have got out of it I
[53:33] mean you think if he didn't go back to
[53:35] the Jews one day and say listen I listen
[53:37] Sanhedrin I apologize I found out I
[53:40] thought this was right I found out it's
[53:42] wrong amen I want to come back to the
[53:44] good side
[53:46] do you think for a second they would
[53:47] have taken him back willingly forgiven
[53:49] all false amen maybe even promoted him
[53:52] Beyond where he was absolutely at any
[53:55] time Paul could have stopped his
[53:57] affliction
[54:00] but he was a love slave
[54:02] he was bound by chains of love so Paul
[54:05] willingly stayed in the pressure
[54:10] in the rejection in the hardship of his
[54:13] own choosing and there that christ-like
[54:16] character was not only developed but it
[54:18] was displayed
[54:21] so how am I going to gain character and
[54:24] display character and the soft living in
[54:26] laodicea you just take the word and the
[54:29] word above everything else and I promise
[54:31] you there'll be affliction
[54:34] there's we've already experienced
[54:36] Affliction and rejection from families
[54:38] rejection from Friends amen when when we
[54:41] when we rejected where we were when we
[54:43] were raised up I was raised up as a
[54:45] Pentecostal boy in an independent
[54:47] Pentecostal Church on one side my
[54:49] parents were divorced one side was that
[54:51] way the other side was through the
[54:52] Pentecostal denomination and and raised
[54:55] all that way but brother when I took the
[54:57] word amen all of a sudden the rejection
[54:59] and the questions and all of that
[55:01] started to come
[55:04] where are we going to meet resistance
[55:07] only by taking the word
[55:13] let's look at Hebrews chapter 11.
[55:27] and I'd like to say in them
[55:29] environment and atmosphere we live in
[55:34] I believe with all my heart it's going
[55:36] to get worse
[55:39] that for in some ways because of laws of
[55:44] religious liberty and political
[55:46] correctness we've had rejections sure
[55:48] we've had people get angry at us we've
[55:50] had people say some horrible things
[55:51] about us and to us we've had family
[55:54] members who reject we've had friends who
[55:56] were separated with we've had all kinds
[55:58] of these difficulties but but it's going
[56:01] to get worse
[56:03] because we can either choose to go with
[56:06] soft living and laodicea or we can
[56:09] choose to take the word and those
[56:11] choices are going to come I think uh
[56:14] more blatantly I should say it that way
[56:16] because I mean we're going to have to
[56:19] face if you're an employer if you have a
[56:21] small business or you're even an
[56:22] employer that worked for a large
[56:24] business and you're in charge of hiring
[56:25] you are going to face issues and lines
[56:27] that you can't cross
[56:29] amen it's already that's already in MO
[56:33] movement it's already in motion and
[56:35] we're going to face some of these things
[56:36] there there are there are all kinds of
[56:38] laws and all kinds of ideas floating
[56:41] around that are trying to be put into
[56:43] law that it's going to cause us to come
[56:45] face to face amen with will we take the
[56:48] word or will we stay where it's
[56:50] comfortable
[56:53] but I believe as a people the bride I
[56:55] know what the bride will do she'll take
[56:56] the word
[56:58] she will take the word and in taking the
[57:00] word she will be entering into more
[57:02] affliction
[57:06] but more Affliction brings more
[57:07] character
[57:09] and more pressure brings out more of the
[57:11] Life of Christ
[57:13] so let's look at Hebrews 11
[57:16] and verse 23.
[57:21] by faith Moses when he was born was hit
[57:23] three months at his parents of his
[57:25] parents because they saw he was a proper
[57:27] child and they were not afraid of the
[57:29] king's commandment by faith Moses when
[57:31] he was coming to years refused to be
[57:33] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[57:34] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[57:37] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[57:39] pleasures of sin for a season
[57:42] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[57:45] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[57:47] he had respect unto the recompense of
[57:49] the reward
[57:51] if you think about what all Moses went
[57:53] through the rejection the the wandering
[57:55] on the backside of the desert the the
[57:58] all the things that he went through
[57:59] before he came back to be a deliverer
[58:01] then after that but you realize that
[58:04] Moses that he did that voluntarily
[58:07] Moses could have stayed in Pharaoh's
[58:10] house
[58:11] he could have stayed right there he had
[58:13] the opportunity to stay planted in
[58:15] Pharaoh's house and get all the
[58:16] Privileges that come from being the son
[58:18] of Pharaoh's daughter whatever that
[58:20] would entitle maybe the next Pharaoh
[58:22] certainly great riches and fame and
[58:24] wealth and power and all the things that
[58:26] are there but he chose willingly the
[58:29] reproach of Christ
[58:31] he chose the word over the luxury he
[58:34] chose the word and what did it get him
[58:36] amen it got him run out of Egypt on the
[58:39] back side of the desert married to a hot
[58:41] tempered wife
[58:44] keeping his father-in-law's flock I mean
[58:47] this it's almost like you know it it put
[58:51] him under trial it put him in difficulty
[58:54] amen but that's exactly where Moses
[58:58] needed to be he was being rung out on
[59:00] the backside of the desert he was being
[59:02] perfected and how did he get there by
[59:04] choosing the word and choosing the word
[59:06] brought him into that condition
[59:11] and when he kept choosing the word it
[59:13] kept getting harder
[59:15] the trials got more difficult it got
[59:17] harder Amen in the hole
[59:20] it's no surprise that Moses was placed
[59:23] where he was there's such an example
[59:25] where Moses was and then when Moses
[59:28] chose because what we were born into
[59:30] amen was a world a society a a culture
[59:34] where things can be so easy we can
[59:37] actually relax
[59:39] if you just wanted if you just wanted to
[59:42] have a family and you wanted to take
[59:43] some vacations and you want to work a
[59:45] job and you want to have a decent home
[59:47] and you want everything to go right you
[59:49] can do that in the society we live in if
[59:51] that's your greatest goal in life if
[59:53] that's all you want out of life you can
[59:55] do that and you can have some good times
[59:57] and you can enjoy some of the better
[59:59] things in life you can get some good
[1:00:00] food and sleep in a comfortable bed and
[1:00:03] it's all there and it's all available
[1:00:04] and men and and all I'd say almost 100
[1:00:07] percent of us have that
[1:00:10] so where is our testing going to come
[1:00:12] from where is our Affliction going to
[1:00:14] come from where is our christ-like
[1:00:15] character going to be molded
[1:00:19] it's when we say I can't do that that's
[1:00:22] wrong
[1:00:24] when we say I won't go that way anymore
[1:00:26] when we say I cannot associate with this
[1:00:29] any longer that's when our Trials come
[1:00:33] that's when difficulties come
[1:00:36] brother remember said in the message the
[1:00:38] God of this evil age
[1:00:40] said now notice closely now as we study
[1:00:43] the word the God of this this evil age
[1:00:46] that we're now living may seem strange a
[1:00:49] very strange thing in this age of Grace
[1:00:51] when God is taking a people for his
[1:00:53] namesake that he that is his bride and
[1:00:57] this evil age that he should be called
[1:00:58] the age of evil
[1:01:00] the very age God is calling a people for
[1:01:03] his namesake by Grace out and his
[1:01:06] calling and is called an evil age
[1:01:08] now we'll prove by the Bible that this
[1:01:10] is the age that he was speaking of
[1:01:13] very strange thing to think that that in
[1:01:15] the evil age like this that God then
[1:01:17] would be calling his bride
[1:01:20] we find now that this this evil age is
[1:01:23] to prove to Satan
[1:01:26] she is not like Eve
[1:01:28] that she is not that type of woman
[1:01:33] and she will be Tried by his word the
[1:01:36] Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the
[1:01:39] word and Adam's bride believed every bit
[1:01:41] of the word all but confused on one
[1:01:43] promise that he is the same yesterday
[1:01:45] today and forever today see but failed
[1:01:48] on One Promise under the temptation of
[1:01:50] the enemy face to face and now the
[1:01:53] people that's called for his name of
[1:01:54] course is his bride she used to come in
[1:01:56] contact Again by the same thing not by
[1:01:59] just denominational truth or something
[1:02:00] but every word
[1:02:03] for in the beginning of the Bible man
[1:02:05] was given the word of God to live by one
[1:02:07] word misinterpreted by a man called
[1:02:09] Satan and a person of an animal called
[1:02:11] The Serpent Satan and this person could
[1:02:14] talk to Eve and misinterpret the word to
[1:02:16] her and was lost see it must be every
[1:02:20] word so brother bam I've quoted this the
[1:02:22] last couple of times we ministered but
[1:02:25] he said
[1:02:26] why why does God let it get to be an
[1:02:30] evil age and the age he would call his
[1:02:32] bride out
[1:02:33] and when you look at the evil age we
[1:02:35] live in it I think the most evil thing
[1:02:38] about this age is the deception
[1:02:41] it is so wicked is such a wicked evil
[1:02:44] age amen but mankind walks around
[1:02:47] feeling good about himself
[1:02:50] amen the culture Society they walk
[1:02:52] around feeling good like with like we're
[1:02:54] good people and we're good and we're
[1:02:57] doing evil wicked things all across the
[1:02:59] board amen marrying and divorcing and
[1:03:02] adulteries and and all kinds of
[1:03:03] fornication going on everywhere rampant
[1:03:06] amen destroying lives before they're
[1:03:09] born I mean all kinds of terrible things
[1:03:12] are going on but we feel good about
[1:03:14] ourselves because we donated a couple
[1:03:16] cans of soup in the dropbox at work
[1:03:19] and I rescued a dog and
[1:03:25] but everywhere around us is absolute
[1:03:28] wickedness
[1:03:31] I mean absolutely Wicked everywhere you
[1:03:34] turn every billboard every magazine
[1:03:36] everything you could listen to or turn
[1:03:38] on it's absolutely Wicked contrary to
[1:03:41] the word of God is evil
[1:03:46] I mean the the the the marriage and
[1:03:48] divorce the the the the the uh whatever
[1:03:51] I mean I you could I could go on and on
[1:03:54] and on the nudity the immorality the it
[1:03:56] is absolutely Wicked everywhere but we
[1:03:59] live in and the people who feel like
[1:04:01] good people
[1:04:03] this is the evil age we live in
[1:04:06] evil and then when you speak about it
[1:04:09] when you share something with somebody
[1:04:11] that it's not right if you simply would
[1:04:13] say it's not right for you to marry that
[1:04:15] woman she has a living husband my
[1:04:17] goodness they turn on you with teeth
[1:04:19] like you're Wicked and you're unloving
[1:04:21] and you're hateful and you're strict and
[1:04:23] you're you're you're a religious bigot
[1:04:29] we've had those circumstances we faced
[1:04:32] them we've had those conversations we
[1:04:34] know exactly what happens
[1:04:36] the same person who goes to church and
[1:04:38] sings I love you I love you you just
[1:04:40] give them the word on and they turn
[1:04:42] around and they call you everything
[1:04:45] why it's an evil Age full of deception
[1:04:50] and why would he let this age get so
[1:04:52] evil and the day that he's going to call
[1:04:54] out his bride amen we we would change it
[1:04:58] I mean to a Euphoria of God's word and
[1:05:00] call out a bride but God doesn't do
[1:05:02] things that way because God loves to
[1:05:04] prove himself he loves to show who's who
[1:05:09] so he brings the bride and he brings the
[1:05:13] bride age in a day where you and I could
[1:05:16] have everything we wanted and if we just
[1:05:18] want to live in peace amen all we got to
[1:05:20] do is keep our mouth shut and not and
[1:05:23] agree with everything that's said but
[1:05:24] you have to absolutely swallow down
[1:05:26] every god-given conviction in every
[1:05:29] matter of right and wrong in the word in
[1:05:30] order to do that
[1:05:35] but no we
[1:05:40] telling you it's going to creep closer
[1:05:42] and closer
[1:05:43] until you can't keep quiet any longer
[1:05:45] because the question is going to be put
[1:05:47] to you
[1:05:51] amen
[1:05:53] let's look at Genesis chapter 3.
[1:06:13] Genesis chapter 3.
[1:06:16] verse 1.
[1:06:18] now why did God let this be an evil age
[1:06:20] he said
[1:06:22] I'll quote it again we find now this
[1:06:25] evil age is to prove to Satan she is not
[1:06:28] like Eve
[1:06:30] she is not that type of woman
[1:06:33] and she will be Tried by his word the
[1:06:35] bride is Adam's bride was Tried by the
[1:06:38] word and Adam's bride believed every bit
[1:06:40] of the word all but confused on one
[1:06:42] promise that he is the same yesterday
[1:06:44] today and forever I love how brother
[1:06:46] Branham said that because
[1:06:48] it's really interesting all confused but
[1:06:52] one word
[1:06:53] all but confused on one promise that
[1:06:56] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:06:58] forever I love how he said that
[1:07:00] because when you go to Genesis it's not
[1:07:02] an issue of yesterday today and forever
[1:07:05] it's an issue of whether or not you're
[1:07:07] supposed to eat of this tree
[1:07:10] but you see it's the same issue
[1:07:13] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:07:14] forever
[1:07:15] so let's read verse one
[1:07:18] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:07:20] beast of the field which the Lord God
[1:07:21] had made and he said unto the woman yay
[1:07:24] yay hath God said You shall not eat of
[1:07:27] every tree of the garden and the woman
[1:07:29] said unto the serpent we may eat of the
[1:07:31] fruit of the Trees of the garden but of
[1:07:32] the fruit of the tree which is in the
[1:07:34] midst of the garden God has said You
[1:07:36] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:07:37] touch it lest you die
[1:07:39] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[1:07:41] shall not surely die now this is the
[1:07:43] contradiction
[1:07:46] but brother Branham said that she failed
[1:07:49] on one promise that he's the same
[1:07:50] yesterday today and forever
[1:07:53] so we're going to tie that together
[1:07:55] you shall not surely die for God doth
[1:07:58] know that in the day you eat thereof
[1:07:59] then your eyes shall be open and you
[1:08:01] shall be as Gods knowing good and evil
[1:08:03] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:08:06] good for food and that it was pleasant
[1:08:07] to the eyes and a treat to be desired to
[1:08:10] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:08:12] thereof and did eat and gave also unto
[1:08:14] her husband with her and he did eat
[1:08:17] so here the the woman fell
[1:08:19] and we want to look at what what is it
[1:08:23] the devil did because now this evil age
[1:08:26] is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve
[1:08:29] she won't do what Eve did so that's the
[1:08:33] test that we're coming to
[1:08:35] the test that we're coming to is the
[1:08:36] same one that Eve faced when she faced
[1:08:39] it face to face we're coming through the
[1:08:41] same thing and it and and it's not going
[1:08:43] to be a repeated scenario with the same
[1:08:46] words but it's the same thing
[1:08:49] and the the serpent began to convince
[1:08:53] Eve that God didn't really mean that
[1:08:58] that you're not surely die that it
[1:09:01] doesn't mean that you're really going to
[1:09:02] die or that or it also means that God's
[1:09:06] not really going to judge according to
[1:09:08] his word
[1:09:10] now if you just think about the
[1:09:12] environment we live in nobody out there
[1:09:15] really believes that God really meant
[1:09:17] what he said in his Bible
[1:09:19] what he said about marriage and divorce
[1:09:22] what he said about adultery what he said
[1:09:24] about morality what he said about hey
[1:09:26] let's just see what he said about water
[1:09:28] baptism in Jesus name or what he said
[1:09:30] about women not cutting their hair or
[1:09:32] what he said about
[1:09:34] you take any of those and you just take
[1:09:37] those subjects and you just throw them
[1:09:38] out there and you realize they do not
[1:09:41] believe that he meant what he said and
[1:09:43] they do not believe that he'll judge
[1:09:44] based on that
[1:09:46] and that's exactly what the serpent
[1:09:49] convinced Eve he convinced Eve that he
[1:09:51] didn't really mean that and he's not
[1:09:52] going to judge he's not going to judge
[1:09:55] you
[1:09:56] so that you can you can divorce that
[1:09:58] woman and remarry another you can take
[1:10:00] another man's wife you can do all these
[1:10:02] things and God's not going to judge that
[1:10:04] because because he loves you
[1:10:08] well that's the very reason he will
[1:10:10] judge it because love is corrective
[1:10:14] so the the world the religious world
[1:10:17] let's just say the religious world is
[1:10:19] convinced that God didn't really mean
[1:10:22] what he said in the Bible
[1:10:24] and those they'll argue that up and down
[1:10:27] but you go try to present to them what
[1:10:29] he said about women not preaching
[1:10:33] they don't believe it
[1:10:35] women not taking leadership positions in
[1:10:37] the church they don't believe it it's
[1:10:40] clear as a bell in the Bible amen but
[1:10:42] they they won't they won't take it about
[1:10:44] a woman uh not cutting her hair having
[1:10:46] long hair they won't take it about a
[1:10:48] woman being subject to her husband they
[1:10:50] won't take it
[1:10:52] absolutely won't take it why because
[1:10:54] Generations ago there was a lie that
[1:10:56] crept in and that lie came on the on the
[1:10:59] heels of the women's Liberation movement
[1:11:02] and they begin to Quant equality for a
[1:11:05] woman and a woman is just as good as a
[1:11:07] man and and all of this other nonsense
[1:11:10] and what it was it looked like it was a
[1:11:13] way to fight oppression but really what
[1:11:15] it was was an evil agenda of Satan to
[1:11:18] get people to deny the word of God
[1:11:21] because that kind that line of thinking
[1:11:23] is absolutely contrary to the word of
[1:11:26] God God made them male and female god
[1:11:29] separated the Sexes God attached certain
[1:11:31] responsibilities to each one and to deny
[1:11:34] that is to deny the word
[1:11:37] but it was laid an innocency at the
[1:11:40] beginning that we just she needed some
[1:11:42] equal rights and she was being oppressed
[1:11:44] and started with you know she needs the
[1:11:46] right to vote
[1:11:49] then there was apparel changes she began
[1:11:51] to wear that which pertained to a man
[1:11:54] and it crept in so suddenly Amen in this
[1:11:58] evil age that that the women were given
[1:12:01] you know equal rights because they're
[1:12:03] just as good as a man and I I deny that
[1:12:07] right because in some ways they're
[1:12:09] better than a man
[1:12:13] if I was a woman I wouldn't settle for
[1:12:16] being equal to a man
[1:12:21] I tell you a woman is so much better at
[1:12:23] having a baby than a man
[1:12:26] there's a world of difference
[1:12:32] see how ludicrous the world is
[1:12:34] absolutely insane
[1:12:37] there's things a woman can do that a man
[1:12:39] can not
[1:12:41] ever do
[1:12:47] there are things that a man can do that
[1:12:49] a woman cannot ever do
[1:12:54] so the whole premise for equality which
[1:12:57] has been sown throughout the world
[1:13:02] it is now the normal thinking
[1:13:06] to think contrary to that is now
[1:13:08] abnormal
[1:13:10] to teach our children contrary to that
[1:13:12] is now considered to be damaging
[1:13:16] it's considered you say no way brother
[1:13:18] Chad it's considered by many Educators
[1:13:21] psychologists to be damaging
[1:13:26] so
[1:13:28] the whole
[1:13:29] lie
[1:13:31] this is a lie
[1:13:33] I'm not I'm not here to preach against
[1:13:35] the women's Liberation movement
[1:13:37] but just to show in a simple example
[1:13:39] that people will believe a lie contrary
[1:13:42] to the word of God but that lie has
[1:13:44] consequences
[1:13:46] and the consequences was Mother entering
[1:13:49] the workforce and leaving the babies at
[1:13:50] home alone
[1:13:52] the consequences was people be able to
[1:13:55] decide how they wanted to live not
[1:13:57] subject to what God Said anymore
[1:14:01] and then women would become more
[1:14:03] masculine because they begin to operate
[1:14:05] with men and they have to change their
[1:14:08] behavior
[1:14:09] so you have a whole effect of women
[1:14:12] becoming more dominant more masculine
[1:14:14] because they're competing in a men's
[1:14:16] World and they have to become more rigid
[1:14:18] they lose that softness they lose that
[1:14:21] gentleness that Gentle Spirit in order
[1:14:23] to be able to work in a corporate world
[1:14:25] or a business world because she wants to
[1:14:26] be equal to the man
[1:14:28] she wants to join the military she wants
[1:14:31] to be in Special Forces she wants to fly
[1:14:33] an Apache helicopter
[1:14:36] instead of being a mother
[1:14:41] so but there's consequences
[1:14:44] because then another generation comes up
[1:14:46] that they can decide how they want to
[1:14:49] act
[1:14:50] they can decide how they want to dress
[1:14:52] now it doesn't matter what gender I'm
[1:14:54] born if I if if I want to get a man's
[1:14:58] job and act like a man and dress like a
[1:15:00] man and talk like a man and walk like a
[1:15:01] man it's my choice
[1:15:04] until then they're now permitted to
[1:15:06] choose their own gender
[1:15:09] I was reading a a scientific paper a
[1:15:12] study paper from like a scientific
[1:15:14] journal I was reading it recently and
[1:15:16] they were using the terminology what
[1:15:19] were they using how did they phrase this
[1:15:21] now I might get it wrong
[1:15:23] they were calling it birth gender
[1:15:27] birth gender
[1:15:29] because in a scientific paper they have
[1:15:33] to identify male and female if they
[1:15:34] separate subjects there's certain things
[1:15:36] if they're going to test it they have to
[1:15:38] know if they're male and female because
[1:15:39] they're not the same there's
[1:15:41] testosterone levels of estrogen levels
[1:15:43] there's a lot of things they have to
[1:15:45] know how something's working so they
[1:15:47] have to identify whether this is male or
[1:15:49] female but they can't offend the world
[1:15:52] so they came up with a new new way for
[1:15:54] scientists to determine what they're
[1:15:55] studying and now this is your birth
[1:15:57] gender it's not your gender it's your
[1:15:59] birth gender
[1:16:01] because you can decide to change your
[1:16:03] gender whenever you want
[1:16:05] and and it's absolutely ludicrous when
[1:16:08] we first started hearing about this I
[1:16:10] don't know I don't even know when to put
[1:16:11] a date when it became uh mainstream in
[1:16:14] conversation maybe 10 years ago 15 years
[1:16:16] ago eight years ago I don't know but at
[1:16:18] first it was laughable that they were
[1:16:20] gonna now allow children now the the
[1:16:22] modern thinking is don't identify your
[1:16:25] child amen with gender pronouns or don't
[1:16:28] identify them with he or she or wait
[1:16:31] till they develop and they determine
[1:16:33] what they want to be
[1:16:36] and it was so ludicrous but it's
[1:16:38] becoming more mainstream
[1:16:40] it's becoming a normal way of thinking
[1:16:43] till now it is so odd that scientists
[1:16:49] who know better
[1:16:52] have to use terminology like birth
[1:16:54] gender
[1:16:56] not I mean can you imagine them coming
[1:16:58] into the study group okay like I know
[1:17:00] you're a man I'm sorry ma'am I'm not I
[1:17:02] mean sir I'm not calling you but what
[1:17:04] when you came out of the womb what were
[1:17:06] you
[1:17:13] and I'm sorry I have to ask that
[1:17:15] because I know that's not what you want
[1:17:17] to be
[1:17:19] how did we get here
[1:17:21] we rejected the Bible and something as
[1:17:23] simple as the roles of a man and a woman
[1:17:27] all the way back I started I think in
[1:17:29] the uh after the turn of the century
[1:17:31] that started moving its way up and you
[1:17:34] started saying how did we get to this
[1:17:37] place
[1:17:38] where where parents are being uh uh uh
[1:17:41] um educated to not Define what their
[1:17:45] children are and gender to let the
[1:17:47] children Define for themselves what
[1:17:48] they're how do we get here how do we get
[1:17:50] to the place that Preschool teachers now
[1:17:53] are being taught to be careful don't use
[1:17:55] gender-specific terminologies about
[1:17:57] these kids because they haven't yet
[1:17:59] decided what they are where how did we
[1:18:01] get here I'll tell you how we got here
[1:18:03] we left the word of God we left it in
[1:18:06] what looked like Simplicity like there
[1:18:08] won't be consequences for just letting a
[1:18:10] woman enter the workforce there won't be
[1:18:11] consequences for letting her put on a
[1:18:13] Peril that pertains to a man but I'm
[1:18:15] telling you every time we leave the word
[1:18:17] there's long reaching serious
[1:18:19] consequences
[1:18:22] what does it matter if I wear a path
[1:18:23] what does it matter if I if I want to be
[1:18:26] a firefighter what does it matter if I
[1:18:27] want to do these things what matters is
[1:18:29] God gave you your position God
[1:18:32] determined how you will be born God set
[1:18:34] the rules and what's happening is the
[1:18:36] God of this evil age is corrupting your
[1:18:38] mind so wickedly that you think you can
[1:18:41] decide contrary to God's decision
[1:18:44] and that God don't care he don't really
[1:18:46] mean that and he won't judge
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:52] David
[1:18:53] and they've gone from there to now
[1:18:55] children aren't deciding their gender
[1:18:57] they're deciding their species
[1:19:01] they're deciding whether they're a dog
[1:19:03] or a cat
[1:19:05] and they're requesting here in Lima
[1:19:09] they're requesting school boards to put
[1:19:11] litter boxes in schools
[1:19:13] because children identify as a dog or a
[1:19:16] cat and they want to use a litter box in
[1:19:18] the restroom
[1:19:19] instead of
[1:19:21] the facilities
[1:19:24] and we can laugh at that but those poor
[1:19:27] kids
[1:19:30] it's funny when you hear about it
[1:19:32] because it's so odd but it's not funny
[1:19:33] when you think about it
[1:19:36] and you say well those those get listen
[1:19:40] who told them they could do that it's
[1:19:43] you mom who decided you didn't want to
[1:19:45] be a woman you wanted to be a man
[1:19:48] it's you dad who wanted to be effeminate
[1:19:50] and turn over the headship to Mom and
[1:19:52] let her run while you go and play and
[1:19:54] golf and act like a kid
[1:19:56] that's whose fault it is it's the fault
[1:19:58] of the religious leaders decades ago
[1:20:00] they wouldn't stand up and say this
[1:20:01] isn't right A man is a man as a woman as
[1:20:04] a woman God gave them roles to play and
[1:20:06] you play your role and quit trying to
[1:20:08] switch
[1:20:12] and all because Satan Got This Modern
[1:20:16] Age to think God doesn't really mean
[1:20:18] that
[1:20:19] and he won't really judge
[1:20:22] but when you've got kids demanding
[1:20:25] litter boxes I'm telling you the
[1:20:26] judgment is here
[1:20:28] this is the Judgment this is the
[1:20:30] consequences for those actions
[1:20:34] and so why would God call a bride out of
[1:20:37] this evil age
[1:20:40] why because he's going to prove to Satan
[1:20:44] she's not like Eve
[1:20:47] that there's going to be a bride here
[1:20:48] when the whole world has gone this
[1:20:50] thinking there's going to be a bride
[1:20:52] that still says I'm glad to be
[1:20:55] identified as a woman because God made
[1:20:57] me a woman
[1:20:58] I'm glad to say I want a gentle feminine
[1:21:02] spirit because that's what God wants me
[1:21:05] to have
[1:21:06] there's a man who says I am glad to be a
[1:21:09] man and I will take responsibility like
[1:21:11] a man according to the word of God
[1:21:13] because I am happy to be what God made
[1:21:16] me to be
[1:21:17] I will dress like a man I will talk like
[1:21:20] a man I will walk like a man because God
[1:21:23] made me one
[1:21:25] and women say I will dress like a woman
[1:21:27] when when in the face of this evil age
[1:21:30] amen when when nobody thinks you're
[1:21:33] normal when nobody thinks it's right I
[1:21:35] don't say nobody you might have had
[1:21:37] somebody think it's right I'm talking
[1:21:38] Society in general thinks it's ludicrous
[1:21:41] think it's archaic think it's
[1:21:42] old-fashioned
[1:21:44] but since when did the Eternal Word
[1:21:46] become old-fashioned
[1:21:48] Eternal means it's forever it can't
[1:21:50] become old
[1:21:51] it's just as current today as it ever
[1:21:54] was that mentality of God that mindset
[1:21:57] of God that he expressed in word it's
[1:21:59] just as true today as it has ever been
[1:22:04] so we're seeing the judgment
[1:22:08] what is the judgment
[1:22:10] Generations now
[1:22:12] have come and gone in this evil age
[1:22:15] until now it's so wicked
[1:22:19] people
[1:22:20] have so
[1:22:23] blaspheme God
[1:22:26] that that they want to deny their human
[1:22:29] and be called a cat
[1:22:31] or a dog
[1:22:33] talk about mocking a creator
[1:22:38] talk about an evil age
[1:22:42] I don't know I've not read all of her
[1:22:44] all of history all the history books
[1:22:47] that are out there but I have never
[1:22:49] heard of anything like this
[1:22:51] there's been bad times before there's
[1:22:53] been Wicked generations and wicked
[1:22:54] Nations and wicked ages but I have never
[1:22:57] heard of anything like this
[1:23:00] and now
[1:23:02] I mean I was I was driving through
[1:23:04] Michigan
[1:23:06] and as I was driving through Michigan
[1:23:07] it's like every third billboard is a
[1:23:10] marijuana billboard
[1:23:13] it's shocking
[1:23:15] and because because
[1:23:18] it got so expensive to fight drugs drug
[1:23:21] abuse drug dealing drug use costs the
[1:23:24] state of Michigan millions of dollars
[1:23:26] Amen in incarcerations and court systems
[1:23:29] and and fees and all those things so now
[1:23:32] what they did is now they decided it's
[1:23:35] no longer immoral to use drugs now it's
[1:23:37] moral
[1:23:40] is that right because that's what
[1:23:42] happens when you elect officials you let
[1:23:43] them decide what's moral for a nation
[1:23:46] so now it's moral to have abortions now
[1:23:48] it's moral to abuse drugs
[1:23:52] and because it's now moral
[1:23:55] now businesses have sprung up seeming
[1:23:58] like everywhere if you count the number
[1:23:59] of billboards I mean it must be a pretty
[1:24:01] good business
[1:24:04] and now they get the tax money off of it
[1:24:06] so now changing the morality has taken
[1:24:10] from spending millions of dollars to
[1:24:12] gaining millions of dollars for the
[1:24:14] state of Michigan
[1:24:17] see how did we get here
[1:24:21] how did we get here
[1:24:23] the morality is changing and the laws
[1:24:26] are changing with the thinking of people
[1:24:29] and now it used to be wrong but now it's
[1:24:32] right
[1:24:34] well I tell you in God's eyes if it was
[1:24:36] ever wrong it's still wrong
[1:24:39] so why is God have us here in this evil
[1:24:41] age because there's going to be somebody
[1:24:43] that will stand with the word regardless
[1:24:46] of the climate
[1:24:48] regardless of whether or not they lose
[1:24:50] privileges or not amen regardless of
[1:24:53] whether or not they lose a good paying
[1:24:55] job they lose a good salary they lose a
[1:24:57] a an association they lose entrance into
[1:25:00] some Society or club or Clan and now it
[1:25:03] no longer matters to them there's a
[1:25:05] people here that'll stand like Paul and
[1:25:07] count it all is done that they might win
[1:25:09] Christ
[1:25:15] brother Brown goes on to say
[1:25:19] and the God of this evil age same
[1:25:21] message
[1:25:22] so then the world seems to be in the
[1:25:24] most evil age that it ever was never in
[1:25:26] any age did women ever act like that
[1:25:28] never but just before the destruction of
[1:25:30] the antiluvian world
[1:25:32] and Jesus referred to it we'll get to
[1:25:34] that after a while
[1:25:36] here's the question this is what I've
[1:25:37] been pondering on for weeks has God lost
[1:25:40] control
[1:25:42] or is he just permitting another agency
[1:25:44] to control
[1:25:47] like God doesn't know what's going on in
[1:25:49] the school systems like God doesn't know
[1:25:50] what's going on in society
[1:25:52] God knows
[1:25:54] has he lost control I'd say he's never
[1:25:57] lost control
[1:25:59] or is he just permitting another agency
[1:26:01] to control listen we can we can get as
[1:26:05] mad as we want at the government
[1:26:07] as mad as we wanted the world we can
[1:26:10] shake our fists at governments and blah
[1:26:12] blah blah blah blah but God has
[1:26:15] permitted another agency to control
[1:26:16] there's a God of this evil age that's
[1:26:19] controlling
[1:26:20] and God has allowed it so you can get so
[1:26:24] irate and angry about the government if
[1:26:26] you go on that political thing you're
[1:26:28] absolutely wasting your breath
[1:26:30] wasting your breath stay with the word
[1:26:33] just if we're going to promote anything
[1:26:35] promote the word that's why I I get so
[1:26:38] discouraged as a as a Believer when I
[1:26:40] see Believers pick up on a political
[1:26:42] party and bumper stickers and signs and
[1:26:44] stuff like that my goodness let's if I'm
[1:26:47] going to spend any time talking to
[1:26:48] anybody about everything it's not going
[1:26:50] to be about my candidate for president
[1:26:51] it's going to be about the word of God
[1:26:55] because it's just a futile effort this
[1:26:58] world is destined for destruction
[1:27:00] America cannot rise again she failed to
[1:27:04] turn at her turning point in 1956 and
[1:27:07] now she cannot write raise again and now
[1:27:09] it God has permitted another agency to
[1:27:12] control and now it's time for us not to
[1:27:14] fight the government not to fight the
[1:27:16] systems they're going to continue to get
[1:27:18] worse
[1:27:21] but it's to stand and the face of it all
[1:27:24] and whenever given the opportunity to
[1:27:26] stand for the word I can't do that
[1:27:28] because the Bible says I can't do that
[1:27:31] because the Bible says I won't do that
[1:27:33] because the word of God says that's what
[1:27:36] we're here for to prove to Satan that we
[1:27:39] do believe he is the same yesterday
[1:27:40] today and forever if it was wrong
[1:27:42] yesterday it's wrong today it'll be
[1:27:44] wrong forever that God's not changing
[1:27:47] his mind about his word it doesn't
[1:27:48] matter how far along the culture goes
[1:27:51] amen I'm not moving with the culture I'm
[1:27:54] staying with the word
[1:27:56] and just because everybody else says
[1:27:58] it's right doesn't make it right amen
[1:28:00] years ago we talked about the
[1:28:02] progression of immorality and the
[1:28:04] denominational church because the
[1:28:05] denominational system as long as they're
[1:28:07] not as bad as the world feel okay
[1:28:10] they're right so you look at the
[1:28:12] churches whatever they were
[1:28:15] 50 years ago is a drastic difference of
[1:28:18] what they are now there are some
[1:28:19] denominations that would not allow their
[1:28:21] women to wear pants just a hundred years
[1:28:23] ago
[1:28:26] some of the denominations now that will
[1:28:28] permit same-sex marriage wouldn't let
[1:28:30] their women wear pants
[1:28:33] or earrings or makeup
[1:28:36] and in a hundred years they've gone from
[1:28:39] not allowing the women Amen to dress
[1:28:41] like a man wear makeup or excessive
[1:28:43] jewelry and to now they'll marry two
[1:28:46] women together at their altar
[1:28:49] and there can be a lesbian or a
[1:28:51] homosexual priest that will perform the
[1:28:53] wedding
[1:28:55] how did they get there
[1:28:57] because they didn't believe God was the
[1:28:59] same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:01] they failed by the same thing he failed
[1:29:04] by hey she knew what the word was but
[1:29:06] she was made to believe that that word
[1:29:08] no longer counts in this situation
[1:29:11] and and it doesn't mean exactly like
[1:29:14] that for this and God won't judge
[1:29:18] and that's exactly what happened to the
[1:29:20] church but the problem is Amen in the
[1:29:22] message many message Believers have
[1:29:24] followed soon so as long as when the
[1:29:26] world goes here as long as the
[1:29:28] denomination church is back here and
[1:29:29] they say we're better than this standard
[1:29:31] then we're okay some of the message
[1:29:33] jerks have been following the
[1:29:34] denominations and as long as we're not
[1:29:36] as bad as the denomination we're okay
[1:29:40] but I said God help us not to fall into
[1:29:42] this trap I don't want to be a few
[1:29:44] degrees better than wrong I want to be
[1:29:47] right with the word of God
[1:29:49] if the prophet of God told us how to
[1:29:51] dress that's how we dress
[1:29:54] the prophet of God told us how we
[1:29:55] conduct ourselves
[1:29:57] how we deal with one another how we live
[1:30:00] in the public how we whatever I mean we
[1:30:03] can we can go through all kinds of
[1:30:04] details but you get the point if the
[1:30:06] prophet of God taught it if the word of
[1:30:08] God is explicit on something that's
[1:30:11] still good today it was good amen it was
[1:30:14] good in 1969 it's still good in 2023.
[1:30:19] we shouldn't be changing with the times
[1:30:24] now of course you know as soon as I say
[1:30:26] that people of course we change with the
[1:30:28] times I mean we now stream we didn't do
[1:30:29] that
[1:30:31] we now use technology that wasn't
[1:30:33] available and you know our style of
[1:30:35] clothing changes
[1:30:38] don't say it doesn't it doesn't go get a
[1:30:40] picture from your
[1:30:43] go give me an old photo album
[1:30:47] but the amount of clothes we wear
[1:30:48] shouldn't change
[1:30:49] the amount of skin that's covered
[1:30:52] how loose or tight fitting it is
[1:30:54] some Styles might change some colors
[1:30:56] might change
[1:30:58] but the morality shouldn't change
[1:31:01] the concept shouldn't change the point's
[1:31:03] not changing
[1:31:06] and so we have to
[1:31:09] we have to be a people that'll stay with
[1:31:12] the word
[1:31:14] and not get duped
[1:31:16] into the God of this evil age coming and
[1:31:18] telling us well that doesn't really
[1:31:21] matter
[1:31:24] God is looking at our heart
[1:31:27] but the prophet told us what's in your
[1:31:29] heart manifest them what's outside
[1:31:33] it
[1:31:35] we can make all kinds of excuses there's
[1:31:37] all kinds I mean we could go through
[1:31:38] days of all the things that we've heard
[1:31:40] and all the excuses that are made but
[1:31:42] that's not the point
[1:31:43] the point is it has to go this way so
[1:31:45] that somebody will prove she's not like
[1:31:48] Eve
[1:31:50] you can get upset we can get upset we
[1:31:52] can you can point to other places you
[1:31:54] can point to other people in the
[1:31:56] assembly from point to other families
[1:31:57] you can point to one another we can
[1:31:59] point all over and say that's wrong
[1:32:00] that's wrong they're going this way and
[1:32:02] how could they do that we can point all
[1:32:04] day long to one another the point's not
[1:32:06] the point it's to recognize that these
[1:32:08] things have to go this way to prove
[1:32:09] she's not like Eve there will be a bride
[1:32:12] who will say as for me and my house we
[1:32:15] will serve the Lord
[1:32:20] so as God lost control
[1:32:23] or is he just permitting another agency
[1:32:25] to control
[1:32:27] I wonder the true answer to this
[1:32:28] question is to my opinion there's two
[1:32:30] opposing spirits in the world today at
[1:32:32] work
[1:32:33] now there can't be no more than two two
[1:32:35] heads and one of them is the holy spirit
[1:32:37] at work the other one is the spirit of
[1:32:38] the devil and in the last days in
[1:32:40] deception
[1:32:41] now I'm going to base my thoughts right
[1:32:43] on here for the rest of the text
[1:32:46] the two Spirits one of them God's holy
[1:32:48] spirit the other one the devil Spirit
[1:32:49] working in deception the people of the
[1:32:52] Earth are now making their choice
[1:32:55] the holy spirit is here calling out a
[1:32:57] bride for Christ he is doing it by
[1:32:59] vindicating his Word of Promise to her
[1:33:01] for this age showing that it is Christ
[1:33:05] if the finger is supposed to move in
[1:33:07] this age the finger will move if the
[1:33:08] foot is supposed to move in this age the
[1:33:10] foot will move if the eye is to see in
[1:33:12] this age that I will see the spirit of
[1:33:15] God as it's growed into the full stature
[1:33:17] of God is the age that we're now living
[1:33:19] in
[1:33:20] the holy spirit is here vindicating the
[1:33:22] message of the hour and the Holy Spirit
[1:33:24] is doing this so that the people that
[1:33:25] believe God will be called out of this
[1:33:28] chaos
[1:33:30] it's grown into the full stature of God
[1:33:35] what is it's growed it's growed out of
[1:33:38] the church ages and has come back to
[1:33:40] defeat the legs and the arms and come
[1:33:42] back to the eyes but now by the
[1:33:44] difference that we're in the
[1:33:45] intelligence the very mind of Christ the
[1:33:46] word has been open
[1:33:48] what is it it's supposed to be Christ on
[1:33:51] full display
[1:33:52] all that he ever was and all that he
[1:33:55] ever will be is supposed to be alive and
[1:33:57] a body of Believers on the earth in this
[1:33:59] evil age
[1:34:02] and I don't think Christ
[1:34:05] I don't think Christ anybody believers
[1:34:08] is compromising on the word
[1:34:11] is changing as the social mentality
[1:34:14] changes
[1:34:16] I think it's staying true
[1:34:18] let's go to Daniel chapter one
[1:34:33] Daniel chapter one
[1:34:44] foreign
[1:34:47] verse 8.
[1:34:51] but Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[1:34:54] would not defile himself with the
[1:34:55] portion of the king's meat nor at the
[1:34:58] wine which he drank therefore he
[1:34:59] requested of the prince of the eunuchs
[1:35:01] that he might not defile himself
[1:35:04] we know the story quite well Daniel and
[1:35:07] his three friends were among those that
[1:35:09] were taken captive
[1:35:10] when Nebuchadnezzar took Judah captive
[1:35:14] they took some of the princes some of
[1:35:15] the children of the royal family and
[1:35:18] took them back to his Palace and they
[1:35:19] were going to educate them to be wise in
[1:35:21] them and Daniel and three of his friends
[1:35:22] they made the cut and they were taken
[1:35:24] because they were part of the the right
[1:35:26] family of the royal seed and they were
[1:35:28] taken out of Judah and they were goodly
[1:35:30] children and they were taken and
[1:35:31] presented to the The Keeper of the
[1:35:34] eunuchs and they were placed under his
[1:35:36] care and the King prescribed the best
[1:35:39] Meats the best this and that but those
[1:35:41] meats were offered to Idols contrary to
[1:35:43] the to the law of Moses and so Daniel
[1:35:46] was far from home and he didn't have his
[1:35:49] parents watching and he didn't have any
[1:35:50] priesthood around
[1:35:54] I just love this
[1:35:56] where was Daniel he was smack dabbing
[1:35:58] the evil age
[1:36:01] and and Daniel was under a bit of
[1:36:04] pressure
[1:36:06] because Daniel was taken from home from
[1:36:10] his culture his Society where what he
[1:36:12] believed was normal
[1:36:14] and he was taken to where what he
[1:36:16] believes is abnormal
[1:36:18] not accepted or respected
[1:36:22] and in that environment he's told that
[1:36:24] they're going to they were going to make
[1:36:26] him a position in the government they're
[1:36:28] training him uh to flourish in this new
[1:36:31] air this new era in this new location
[1:36:33] that he'll be a man of prestige a man of
[1:36:36] Honor uh uh uh somebody a wise man in
[1:36:40] counsel with the King
[1:36:42] so there's a lot of pressure
[1:36:44] on him
[1:36:46] but what I love about Daniel is it
[1:36:48] didn't matter where he was and it didn't
[1:36:50] matter who he was around and it didn't
[1:36:52] matter what was normal there amen he
[1:36:55] remembered the god of Moses he
[1:36:57] remembered the law he remembered what
[1:36:59] God Said and he we purposed in his heart
[1:37:01] not to vile and defiled himself with the
[1:37:04] king's me regardless of the consequences
[1:37:07] he's captive in a foreign land who knows
[1:37:10] he could be killed he could be
[1:37:11] imprisoned he could be he could just be
[1:37:12] kicked out on the street I don't know
[1:37:14] what would happen to him but there was
[1:37:16] potential consequences for his actions
[1:37:19] but the consequences didn't matter the
[1:37:21] pressure from the King didn't matter and
[1:37:23] what everybody else around him thought
[1:37:26] didn't matter What mattered to Daniel is
[1:37:28] he was going to keep the word of God
[1:37:32] you want a lesson for us and the Bible
[1:37:34] calls him a child
[1:37:36] how old he was we can only guess but I
[1:37:39] don't even think he was yet a young man
[1:37:40] so he's he's here as a child maybe a
[1:37:43] young teenager somewhere in there give
[1:37:46] or take a few years and he is already
[1:37:48] determining in his heart not to defile
[1:37:51] himself what the king's meat without a
[1:37:53] mother or father giving him counsel
[1:37:55] without a priest giving him counsel but
[1:37:57] out of his own heart he's going to love
[1:38:00] God what did Daniel do he just made
[1:38:03] himself a prisoner of God
[1:38:06] and he just set himself up for potential
[1:38:09] affliction
[1:38:12] we find later in Daniel's life if you go
[1:38:14] to chapter six with me if you're still
[1:38:17] in the Book of Daniel chapter 6 verse
[1:38:19] 10.
[1:38:26] it says now
[1:38:28] chapter 6 verse 10 now when Daniel knew
[1:38:30] that the writing was signed what is what
[1:38:32] writing they were trying to stop Daniel
[1:38:34] because they were jealous of him
[1:38:36] so they the the other presidents they
[1:38:38] they got together with uh the king of
[1:38:41] that day and and got him to sign a
[1:38:43] decree that if anybody prayed to any
[1:38:44] other God but himself for a period of
[1:38:46] time that they would be cast into the
[1:38:48] lion's den and Daniel knew it he knew
[1:38:50] what they had done he knew it was signed
[1:38:52] into law
[1:38:53] and it says now when Daniel knew that
[1:38:54] the writing was signed he went into his
[1:38:57] house and his windows being opened in
[1:38:59] his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled
[1:39:01] down upon his knees three times a day
[1:39:03] and prayed and gave thanks before his
[1:39:05] God as he did a four time
[1:39:10] the changing of the law didn't change
[1:39:12] God's law
[1:39:15] the changing of culture the changing of
[1:39:17] society the changing of politics didn't
[1:39:21] change the word of God
[1:39:23] and Daniel still knelt and prayed as he
[1:39:26] always did to his god with his window
[1:39:28] open to Jerusalem because he still wants
[1:39:31] the blessing that was in Solomon's
[1:39:33] Prayer
[1:39:34] because he believed the word of God this
[1:39:36] is a man who is a very high-ranking
[1:39:39] official now in the government and and
[1:39:41] he everybody was jealous of him because
[1:39:43] of that and that's what got him into
[1:39:45] trouble was their jealousy amen but it
[1:39:47] didn't matter to him if he lost his
[1:39:49] position if you got thrown in the Lion's
[1:39:51] Den all of that was inconsequential
[1:39:53] because What mattered to him most was to
[1:39:55] keep the word
[1:39:56] to stay true to God what did Daniel do
[1:39:59] we find him as an old man we've saw him
[1:40:02] there as a child refusing the king's
[1:40:03] meat but now as an old man we find him
[1:40:06] still Shackled In Chains of love and
[1:40:09] bound as a love slave imprisoner to God
[1:40:14] you know Moses gave up the riches of
[1:40:17] Egypt
[1:40:19] Paul gave up his position in the
[1:40:22] religious order of the day and under the
[1:40:24] Roman government
[1:40:26] but if you look at years later after
[1:40:28] what they gave up
[1:40:30] after Moses gave up Egypt Egypt was
[1:40:33] destroyed
[1:40:36] after Paul gave up the Jewish religion
[1:40:38] amen the the Jerusalem was destroyed
[1:40:43] so they could have kept what was
[1:40:45] temporal
[1:40:47] or they could have moved to what was
[1:40:49] eternal
[1:40:50] and both of them moved to what was
[1:40:52] eternal and years later they find where
[1:40:55] they came of is under absolute
[1:40:57] destruction and ruination
[1:40:59] and I say everything in this world is
[1:41:02] headed for a burnout
[1:41:04] uh your the jobs our houses our cars our
[1:41:07] achievements everything in this world is
[1:41:10] headed for Destruction amen it doesn't
[1:41:12] matter it doesn't matter that you've
[1:41:14] worked at that company 30 years amen
[1:41:16] once they once they change the order and
[1:41:19] you can no longer be a Christian and
[1:41:21] stay there it's time to leave
[1:41:27] I mean a lot of stuff goes on that we're
[1:41:29] not involved in I mean you think about
[1:41:31] all the uh how many books are incorrect
[1:41:34] at all these businesses they keep coming
[1:41:37] out one after another after another
[1:41:39] they've been keeping false books amen
[1:41:41] that's not your fault you have no idea
[1:41:43] what they're doing it's not your
[1:41:44] decision it's not your consequence but
[1:41:46] when they come to you and say you now
[1:41:48] have to do this
[1:41:51] what are we going to do
[1:41:53] you now have to do this
[1:41:55] you now have no option
[1:41:58] I'll say you know what
[1:42:00] everything in this life
[1:42:02] is headed for a destruction
[1:42:05] but I want to stay like Moses did like
[1:42:09] Daniel did like David did with that that
[1:42:12] will not fail that will not fall away
[1:42:17] we have
[1:42:19] an eternal Kingdom coming
[1:42:21] I don't want to hold on to what's
[1:42:23] temporal
[1:42:24] fearing I'll lose what's going to burn
[1:42:26] anyways
[1:42:28] but help me God to hold on to what will
[1:42:30] last forever
[1:42:35] he says in Christ is revealed in his own
[1:42:37] word he says down through the age we
[1:42:39] started off from the foundation from the
[1:42:40] first church age when the seed went in
[1:42:42] the ground the complete seed then it
[1:42:44] came out through the feet Luther came
[1:42:46] back out through Wesley then to
[1:42:48] Pentecostals the tongues and the lips
[1:42:50] see now it's in the eyes prophetic of
[1:42:52] Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's
[1:42:54] nothing else for it to to come but him
[1:42:57] himself to step into that because that's
[1:42:59] the last thing there is
[1:43:01] him himself to step into what to step
[1:43:04] into his bride
[1:43:08] the next is the intelligence and we have
[1:43:10] no intelligence of our own it's his we
[1:43:12] have no side of our own how can a man
[1:43:13] foresee these things
[1:43:15] he can't do it it's God himself it's
[1:43:17] becoming to a place and he's governing
[1:43:19] the body all the way through then the
[1:43:21] complete body of Christ is revealed in
[1:43:23] the form of a bride that was taken out
[1:43:25] of his side like Adam did at the
[1:43:27] beginning like Adams was rather at the
[1:43:30] beginning
[1:43:31] so the complete body of Christ
[1:43:33] is revealed in the form of a bride
[1:43:36] and she is here in this evil age
[1:43:40] so what is she here for
[1:43:44] I think she's here to manifest the word
[1:43:47] despite it all
[1:43:51] in the message Christ is the mystery of
[1:43:53] God revealed
[1:43:54] it says his presence in the individual
[1:43:56] with a personal Vindication of himself
[1:43:59] expressing himself The Living Word
[1:44:02] that's promised for the day expressing
[1:44:04] itself through you a Vindication of the
[1:44:07] great revelation of God
[1:44:09] what is it Christ in you the hope of
[1:44:12] glory that's what this age is set up for
[1:44:14] to display that
[1:44:16] that's why it's so wicked that's why
[1:44:18] it's so evil that's why we now have to
[1:44:20] face it I I mean we used to talk about
[1:44:23] it over there
[1:44:25] but the world has got so corrupt now it
[1:44:27] comes right into our extended families
[1:44:28] we have to face it we have to deal with
[1:44:30] it we have to talk about things we even
[1:44:32] have to reject certain ideas
[1:44:36] we can't just we can't just let it go
[1:44:39] now it's coming home it's coming right
[1:44:41] around us it's getting closer and closer
[1:44:43] all the time
[1:44:46] what what is God doing in this day he's
[1:44:49] vindicating himself
[1:44:51] in her
[1:44:54] and look he says look only in an
[1:44:57] individual
[1:44:58] never a group an individual not a group
[1:45:00] his identification is with an individual
[1:45:02] you get that
[1:45:03] not with the method it's not with the
[1:45:05] Baptist not the Presbyterian not the
[1:45:06] Lutheran not the Pentecostals but as an
[1:45:08] individual I'll take one and leave one
[1:45:10] I'll separate them there'll be two in
[1:45:12] the field I'll take one leave one
[1:45:13] they'll be two in bed I'll take one
[1:45:14] leave one it's not a group it's a
[1:45:17] personal Vindication of a pregnated
[1:45:19] child of God filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:21] so surrendered to God that he don't care
[1:45:24] about anything else and the Holy Spirit
[1:45:27] living its life pulsating through him
[1:45:28] showing the personal
[1:45:31] personal Vindication of the word itself
[1:45:33] expressing itself to the people and to
[1:45:37] the world
[1:45:38] why are we here in this evil days why is
[1:45:40] it that your sisters walk down the road
[1:45:43] or walked through a shopping center and
[1:45:45] you're the only one dressed like a lady
[1:45:48] why
[1:45:49] so that he can manifest himself
[1:45:53] why is it that when you go to a
[1:45:55] restaurant and sit down you're the only
[1:45:56] family that's sitting there bowing their
[1:45:59] heads and praying for a meal and talking
[1:46:00] to one another everybody else if there's
[1:46:02] four people at the table there's four
[1:46:04] phones on the table
[1:46:07] what are we here to do manifest the word
[1:46:09] of God
[1:46:11] manifest when when we just do the most
[1:46:14] simple and basic of things when we know
[1:46:16] who we are in our roles as a father and
[1:46:19] a mother and children when we show
[1:46:21] mutual respect for one another when we
[1:46:23] dress right when we act right when we
[1:46:25] speak right when we refuse to do and say
[1:46:27] and take part in the things that are
[1:46:29] contrary to the word of God it's
[1:46:31] beginning more and more to stand out in
[1:46:33] such contrast that it becomes a lit up
[1:46:35] billboard everywhere you go
[1:46:38] why did God put us in this evil age so
[1:46:41] that he can vindicate himself this isn't
[1:46:44] the time anymore where everybody was
[1:46:46] moral and everybody was a moral
[1:46:49] Christian everybody's still a Christian
[1:46:51] but under the deception they're no
[1:46:53] longer moral Christians
[1:46:57] why because God wants to display himself
[1:47:01] not
[1:47:03] to hide
[1:47:04] but to show
[1:47:07] he says
[1:47:09] this is what he says in the message
[1:47:11] Investments he said I said in the
[1:47:13] message if Beethoven was in you you
[1:47:16] would do the works of Beethoven
[1:47:18] you would live the life of Beethoven you
[1:47:20] couldn't do anything nothing else you
[1:47:22] could do nothing else but compose songs
[1:47:23] and you'd be the great writer Beethoven
[1:47:26] because he's in you that's who you would
[1:47:28] be you would be a reincarnate Beethoven
[1:47:32] if the spirit of Beethoven was in you
[1:47:34] you would you would write songs
[1:47:36] and if Christ is in you the Life of
[1:47:38] Christ you will be the lover of the word
[1:47:41] nothing can stand and take the place of
[1:47:43] the word because he is the word he can't
[1:47:45] deny his own word and remain God
[1:47:48] that's why we're in this evil age
[1:47:50] it's because he'll not deny his own word
[1:47:52] and he's got a people who won't deny his
[1:47:55] word
[1:47:58] praise God
[1:48:00] there's been a time especially in this
[1:48:03] nation
[1:48:04] because this nation is so religious
[1:48:07] that we can continue on as we are and
[1:48:10] and be kind of left alone
[1:48:15] I don't know that it's always going to
[1:48:17] be like that
[1:48:18] I don't know for how long I don't know
[1:48:20] it may always be like that I don't know
[1:48:21] I'm not predicting the future I don't
[1:48:24] know the future
[1:48:25] but even if it doesn't it doesn't mean
[1:48:28] we're going to change our stance on the
[1:48:29] word
[1:48:31] brother Benham said they're gonna shut
[1:48:33] the doors to this church and one's like
[1:48:35] it he says that in many many places what
[1:48:37] will they shut the door for I don't know
[1:48:39] maybe because there's things we can't
[1:48:41] accept maybe there's things we refuse to
[1:48:43] participate in or refuse to join with I
[1:48:46] don't know exactly how everything will
[1:48:47] look but I'm telling you when I don't
[1:48:50] think God wants us to to just blend in I
[1:48:53] think he created he he permitted an evil
[1:48:56] spirit to create an evil age so there's
[1:48:58] no more blending in
[1:49:00] when everybody thinks there's a
[1:49:02] Christian there's got to be a display of
[1:49:04] what a real Christian is
[1:49:06] so we let everything get so dark so that
[1:49:09] a little light can shine bright
[1:49:11] and when it gets dark as far as lack of
[1:49:14] truth even a little candle in a pitch
[1:49:16] black room puts off a great deal of
[1:49:18] light
[1:49:19] and this world is getting darker and
[1:49:21] darker amen and we're becoming brighter
[1:49:24] and brighter because of the darkness all
[1:49:25] around us it gives us an opportunity
[1:49:28] Amen to share with others what it is
[1:49:30] that's different about us
[1:49:34] amen so it's Christ it's not us it's
[1:49:38] Christ
[1:49:39] what forms he in he's in a bride form
[1:49:42] what is Christ Christ is the word so
[1:49:44] it's not us it's the word in us living
[1:49:48] his own word creating a contrast
[1:49:53] you can say
[1:49:54] I hate this world I live in
[1:49:56] has anybody ever say that
[1:49:59] why is it so bad I'm disgusted by what I
[1:50:02] see
[1:50:03] but yet God knew it would be this way
[1:50:05] and he placed you here anyways
[1:50:08] you and I are here
[1:50:10] to serve God's purpose
[1:50:12] I want to read this one last quote
[1:50:16] so let's listen to this together
[1:50:19] and his character was that he did
[1:50:22] everything that pleased God and he
[1:50:24] stayed with the word
[1:50:27] that's his character the character of
[1:50:28] Jesus Christ is he did everything that
[1:50:31] pleased God and stayed with the word
[1:50:33] that's what he wanted us for we'd stay
[1:50:35] with God's word and find our place and
[1:50:38] then know where we stay where we're at
[1:50:39] stay with his word and think of it we
[1:50:42] are invited to shape our own character
[1:50:43] to his now we're going to find out what
[1:50:46] we've we've done shape our character to
[1:50:48] his own by his own Spirit then we be it
[1:50:51] by him our sons of God just what I've
[1:50:54] expressed by having his mind in us to
[1:50:56] shape our character to his mind let the
[1:50:59] mind that was in Christ be in you if
[1:51:01] that mind is in you then you see he only
[1:51:04] did that which pleased God he knowed who
[1:51:06] he was he he came the Son of God he
[1:51:09] knowed he was to take the place his
[1:51:10] character had to be that way and then
[1:51:13] when he having had having taken his
[1:51:15] place he knowed what the Messiah was
[1:51:17] required of and he always sought to God
[1:51:20] to do those things and did nothing until
[1:51:22] the father showed him now if you find
[1:51:25] your place sister don't let me hurt you
[1:51:27] or brother but you'll find your place in
[1:51:29] the word as a Christian not what the
[1:51:31] Creed said that's down here in the lower
[1:51:33] cannon fodder that's going to be
[1:51:34] destroyed see you find your place as a
[1:51:37] Christian because your character is
[1:51:39] molded as Christ you are Zoe the same as
[1:51:42] he was Zoe then if the Bible said for a
[1:51:44] woman not to cut her hair how can you do
[1:51:46] it
[1:51:47] it says man is the ruler of his house
[1:51:49] how can you be how can you woman be
[1:51:51] what's the matter with you man that's
[1:51:53] sons of God see you don't find your
[1:51:55] place you're invited to come and take
[1:51:58] his character by having his character in
[1:52:00] you it molds you into the same mind that
[1:52:03] he was and his mind was always to do
[1:52:06] what the father had ordained him to do
[1:52:10] so if we have his mind if we're going to
[1:52:12] be like Christ to be like Christ means
[1:52:15] that we surrender to the word
[1:52:17] what did Christ do we're going to do the
[1:52:19] works of Christ what are the works of
[1:52:21] Christ he says I did nothing unless the
[1:52:23] father shows me he only did that which
[1:52:26] God said do
[1:52:28] so we can make it all kinds of other
[1:52:30] things if we do the works of Christ
[1:52:31] it'll look like this and it'll look like
[1:52:33] this and we'll have this manifestation
[1:52:35] but when it comes down to really the
[1:52:37] core of it all what does it mean to do
[1:52:39] what Christ did and have christ-like
[1:52:40] character it means to do whatever the
[1:52:43] word says do
[1:52:45] it's that simple
[1:52:49] he said search the scriptures they
[1:52:52] testify me in other words if you don't
[1:52:53] do exactly what the scripture said I'm
[1:52:55] to do then show me where now what if God
[1:52:58] stood on the platform today today and
[1:52:59] said what's required of a Christian then
[1:53:02] where would we be see the character
[1:53:04] isn't expressing itself
[1:53:06] so it's in this atmosphere that the
[1:53:08] character Christ expresses itself
[1:53:12] his mind was to stay with the father's
[1:53:14] word
[1:53:15] the their mind was the the same mind
[1:53:18] that was in them was in to be in us and
[1:53:20] if his mind is in us we'd do like he did
[1:53:22] if his character is in us will be as he
[1:53:25] was
[1:53:26] all the prophets had that we know he
[1:53:29] took we took take about Noah now he
[1:53:32] didn't this day Moses what he did in his
[1:53:33] day Daniel and his day the Hebrew
[1:53:35] children and so forth the word molds
[1:53:38] God's character to us
[1:53:40] and anything that's tried to be mixed
[1:53:42] with that character breaks the mold
[1:53:45] so what is this evil day for
[1:53:48] to show that she's not like Eve
[1:53:51] that she won't be confused on all but
[1:53:53] one word that he's the same yesterday
[1:53:55] today and forever and that God does not
[1:53:59] change his mind concerning his word
[1:54:04] in the Book of Esther I just want to
[1:54:06] share this with you as we close
[1:54:08] we've been through it so we won't take
[1:54:10] time to go into it but in the Book of
[1:54:12] Esther
[1:54:13] we know Esther was called for a certain
[1:54:14] time she went to the king's Palace when
[1:54:16] all the fair young virgins were chosen
[1:54:19] but she wasn't like the rest of the fair
[1:54:21] and young virgins there was something
[1:54:22] different about Esther
[1:54:24] and what was different about Esther is
[1:54:26] she was humble and meek and she was
[1:54:28] submissive
[1:54:30] and it says in Esther 220 I'm just going
[1:54:33] to read it to you quickly
[1:54:36] it says Esther had not yet showed her
[1:54:38] Kindred nor her people this was after
[1:54:40] she became Queen
[1:54:42] she had still not yet showed her Kindred
[1:54:44] or a people as Mordecai had charged her
[1:54:46] for Esther did the Commandment of
[1:54:48] Mordecai like as when she was brought up
[1:54:51] with him
[1:54:52] we saw Daniel and his friends away from
[1:54:55] home somewhere else still keeping the
[1:54:57] word
[1:54:58] we saw Paul keeping the word Moses
[1:55:01] keeping the word we've seen them all
[1:55:03] keeping the word but here's Esther with
[1:55:05] that same kind of character that even
[1:55:07] now she's a queen she's been put in the
[1:55:10] House of vashti Amen Mordecai can't even
[1:55:13] get to her and do anything to her
[1:55:15] there's no punishment going to come
[1:55:17] there's no rebuke even going to come but
[1:55:20] now she's so submissive and humble she's
[1:55:22] still doing exactly what Mordecai told
[1:55:24] her just like when she was in his house
[1:55:27] this is the kind of character I want
[1:55:29] where if I'm all by myself in a wrong
[1:55:31] thought comes in I'll say God forgive me
[1:55:34] I reject that thought in the name of
[1:55:35] Jesus Christ
[1:55:37] not because of what others think or what
[1:55:39] others see or because of a group
[1:55:40] standard I want to do what I do out of a
[1:55:43] pure motive to serve God because his
[1:55:45] word says and I want to be true to the
[1:55:47] word
[1:55:48] that is true Christianity
[1:55:54] it says and Esther earlier in the Book
[1:55:57] of Esther
[1:56:00] when Esther went to go
[1:56:02] to the king to present herself to the
[1:56:04] king every young Maiden can take
[1:56:06] anything she wanted
[1:56:09] you remember we've been through this you
[1:56:10] could take anything she wanted whatever
[1:56:12] she wanted she could take with her
[1:56:14] but it says Esther required nothing
[1:56:17] but what haggy I had appointed
[1:56:20] what was different about Esther she was
[1:56:23] submissive
[1:56:25] and what is different about this bride
[1:56:27] brother Ben said there's been churches
[1:56:29] churches and Brides brides but there's
[1:56:30] got to come one
[1:56:32] what's going to be different about this
[1:56:34] one this one no matter what will stay
[1:56:38] with the word
[1:56:39] that's what will be done different with
[1:56:41] this one
[1:56:43] brother Benham said
[1:56:46] he said
[1:56:49] we are his victory
[1:56:53] the church is his victory
[1:56:56] when God can get preeminence in a body
[1:56:59] of Believers and his live his life
[1:57:01] through the bride that's his victory
[1:57:04] and the reason of his death
[1:57:07] that God is has allowed a release of an
[1:57:12] evil spirit to work he's allowed another
[1:57:15] Spirit to work
[1:57:17] because when he can get preeminence and
[1:57:20] a body of Believers in Satan's Eden
[1:57:22] that's his victory
[1:57:24] and the reason of his death
[1:57:26] and I want him to have his victory in me
[1:57:29] and let's all stand
[1:57:32] musicians if you'll come
[1:57:38] brother memes goes on to say at the
[1:57:40] finishing of this quote down here in
[1:57:41] Christ as the mystery of God revealed he
[1:57:44] said notice the Vindicated word in his
[1:57:47] body
[1:57:48] is his victory and the reason of his
[1:57:52] death
[1:57:54] why are we living in such a dark age
[1:57:56] because we're supposed to shine a bright
[1:57:59] light
[1:58:00] does it disgust us absolutely but I'm
[1:58:03] not going to scream about it being
[1:58:04] disgusting anymore
[1:58:06] because it has to be this way
[1:58:09] it's we I've heard of things in the last
[1:58:13] few years that I never dreamed of
[1:58:15] hearing
[1:58:16] hearing of activities people and things
[1:58:18] that they do things that are allowed
[1:58:20] what school systems allow and what they
[1:58:22] teach and it's just been the last five
[1:58:24] years it feels like the whole world has
[1:58:27] lost its mind
[1:58:29] the way that they're what they're doing
[1:58:32] with Children what they're doing with
[1:58:33] schools what what they're doing in
[1:58:35] science it feels like the whole world
[1:58:37] has lost its mind but I say the
[1:58:39] environment is just exactly right for
[1:58:42] what God wants he wants to display
[1:58:44] himself in Bride form
[1:58:47] so I'm not going to let the condition of
[1:58:49] the world discourage me but I want the
[1:58:51] condition of the world to encourage me
[1:58:53] that it's time to rise and shine for thy
[1:58:56] light has come
[1:58:58] it's time to stay with the word
[1:58:59] regardless of whatever circumstances and
[1:59:02] what everybody thinks about it but it's
[1:59:04] time just to stay with the word humble
[1:59:07] ourselves be simple amen no matter where
[1:59:09] we find ourselves at work I want to be
[1:59:12] just like I was in Mordecai's house
[1:59:16] in the in the chamber separated in the
[1:59:19] palace at work on vacation by myself I
[1:59:23] don't want to change my standard when I
[1:59:27] change my environment and change my
[1:59:29] company
[1:59:31] I want I want it to be Christ in me 24
[1:59:34] 7.
[1:59:36] and in order to do that Chad Lamb's got
[1:59:39] to die
[1:59:40] in order for him to have preeminence
[1:59:42] then I've got to I've got to take up my
[1:59:45] cross daily and follow after him I've
[1:59:48] got to die to reputation I have to die
[1:59:51] to familiar love I have to die to all
[1:59:54] kinds of things in order to stay true to
[1:59:55] this
[1:59:56] and I said God
[1:59:58] help me die
[2:00:01] I want to read one last scripture
[2:00:02] Colossians 3 I'll read you don't take
[2:00:04] your Bibles but I'll read Colossians 3
[2:00:05] verse 1.
[2:00:07] if ye then be risen with Christ
[2:00:10] seek those things which are above where
[2:00:12] Christ sitteth on the right hand of God
[2:00:14] set your affection on things above not
[2:00:17] on things on the Earth
[2:00:19] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[2:00:21] with Christ and God
[2:00:24] when you hear the next report of
[2:00:26] something else going crazy in the world
[2:00:28] just remember my affections are not set
[2:00:31] on anything down here
[2:00:33] but they're set on the things that are
[2:00:35] above and this is not my kingdom the
[2:00:38] kingdom I'm part of is coming next
[2:00:41] but I'm I'm planted here for a purpose
[2:00:45] God help me to live that purpose
[2:00:48] and let's bow our heads together Lord
[2:00:50] Jesus we thank you
[2:00:52] God we thank you
[2:00:55] that this evil age
[2:00:57] cannot overcome your Eternal purpose
[2:01:02] God you said there'll be a bride in the
[2:01:04] end time that will not fall like he fell
[2:01:08] because she's predestinated not to
[2:01:12] God we have no idea what may transpire
[2:01:16] in the next few years months days weeks
[2:01:18] we don't know we have no idea
[2:01:21] but what we've seen in the last five
[2:01:23] years has been shocking
[2:01:26] God I pray that you'd help us to stay
[2:01:29] true to this word
[2:01:30] no matter how much society and culture
[2:01:33] loses its mind
[2:01:35] help us to receive your mind
[2:01:37] and stay true to your word
[2:01:40] God I pray to give each one of us
[2:01:42] courage Lord
[2:01:44] that we might make ourselves Your Love
[2:01:46] slaves Lord Jesus I want to be bound by
[2:01:49] chains of love I want to declare myself
[2:01:51] your prisoner
[2:01:53] God I don't want you to have to use
[2:01:55] rules and a heavy hand and chains and
[2:01:58] irons and bars to keep me in
[2:02:01] God I want my love to you to be Bond
[2:02:04] enough
[2:02:05] to keep me true to you help me God
[2:02:09] help me die to myself and help me to
[2:02:11] serve you
[2:02:12] regardless of where the world goes and
[2:02:14] regardless of where my friends go
[2:02:16] regardless of where my family goes
[2:02:18] help me to stay true to you
[2:02:21] God I pray that you would give us more
[2:02:25] of yourself reveal your mind to us
[2:02:28] change us o God by Your Word
[2:02:31] and help us to stay true to that word
[2:02:34] I love you father I pledge myself fresh
[2:02:36] to you again
[2:02:37] pray to forgive me for my failures of
[2:02:40] the past where I let you down where I
[2:02:42] failed but God I pray you would help me
[2:02:45] in the future that I could stay
[2:02:47] surrendered to you that you could have
[2:02:49] preeminence in me
[2:02:51] God shine your light through this vessel
[2:02:53] in this day
[2:02:54] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[2:02:59] God bless you friends
[2:03:00] [Music]
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:26] [Music]
[2:03:35] the less it means to
[2:03:40] to foreign
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:52] [Music]
[2:04:02] [Laughter]
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:08] us
[2:04:10] I really want to
[2:04:15] see
[2:04:18] for the more I see of this old world the
[2:04:27] Blessed means to me
[2:04:31] for it's Jesus
[2:04:35] I really want
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:42] oh I thank God there's been a door open
[2:04:44] in heaven
[2:04:45] so when the world gets dark we can look
[2:04:47] up
[2:04:48] and be caught up and see us something
[2:04:51] that's completely different than what we
[2:04:53] see around us if you look back through
[2:04:56] the Bible
[2:04:57] there's to me two kinds of testings two
[2:05:00] kinds of Trials I'm sure there's more if
[2:05:02] you look at that but just for the sake
[2:05:04] of the this morning
[2:05:06] there's those things that happen to
[2:05:08] people that try them and press them and
[2:05:11] get the character out of them there's
[2:05:13] things that happen of no fault of their
[2:05:15] own they just happen and the same thing
[2:05:17] true in our lives
[2:05:19] but so many times in the Bible there's
[2:05:22] things that happen to people because of
[2:05:24] choices they made to follow God
[2:05:27] and they'd make the choice and they
[2:05:28] follow God then the pressure comes then
[2:05:31] the squeeze comes down then the trial
[2:05:32] begins
[2:05:34] and I think the same thing is true in
[2:05:36] our life there's many things that happen
[2:05:37] to us not because of a decision
[2:05:40] necessarily made but there's trials that
[2:05:42] come in testings that God allows things
[2:05:44] that happen but there's also those
[2:05:46] things where we choose to take the word
[2:05:49] and the face of opposition and then the
[2:05:51] squeeze comes down and the pressure
[2:05:53] comes
[2:05:54] and what does it do
[2:05:56] it manifests the character it forms
[2:05:58] character and manifests character
[2:06:01] so many in the Bible we could talk about
[2:06:03] so many characters
[2:06:05] they knew going this decision going this
[2:06:08] route it's going to cause all kinds of
[2:06:10] backlash but they win anyways
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:17] I want to stand when that gets out ten
[2:06:19] thousands of my friends will leave me
[2:06:20] thinking I was saying that about myself
[2:06:23] but he said it anyways he went preaching
[2:06:26] in in California he said I come
[2:06:28] preaching as hard I can as hard as I can
[2:06:29] up and down the coast of California
[2:06:31] about bombed hair women and every year
[2:06:33] it's worse
[2:06:35] and you say well why are you preaching
[2:06:36] for them preacher he says somebody's got
[2:06:38] to say it and what did it cause him it
[2:06:41] caused him rejection that very preaching
[2:06:44] against the conduct and attitude and
[2:06:45] dress and then morality of women caused
[2:06:48] him to get pushed out of the
[2:06:51] businessman's fellowship but he never
[2:06:53] shut up on it it causes Rejection it
[2:06:56] caused problems but because it was the
[2:06:58] word of God and he was responsible for
[2:06:59] preaching the word of God he said it
[2:07:01] anyhow
[2:07:04] I'm so glad we had a prophet like that
[2:07:07] in this age
[2:07:09] but more than a prophet being like that
[2:07:11] I want to be a daddy like that and a
[2:07:13] husband like that I want to be a
[2:07:15] co-worker and a friend and a family I
[2:07:17] want it it may hurt it may be rejection
[2:07:20] but I want to thank my stand for Christ
[2:07:23] because it will benefit somebody
[2:07:27] I do not want to be a chameleon
[2:07:30] and change color in every environment
[2:07:34] but I want to be a sea Gene of almighty
[2:07:37] God manifesting the Life of Christ
[2:07:39] everywhere
[2:07:41] also means I don't want to walk into a
[2:07:43] room and start cursing Bob there I mean
[2:07:45] that's not what I mean
[2:07:47] I'm not talking about going and creating
[2:07:49] trouble for no reason
[2:07:51] so many things that we have to face and
[2:07:54] we have to deal with that's trouble
[2:07:55] enough
[2:07:57] if we take the word and everything we'll
[2:07:59] have our own squeeze
[2:08:01] we'll have our own little squeezes we've
[2:08:03] had them in the past we'll have them and
[2:08:05] again but what will it do it'll bring
[2:08:07] the fragrance of Christ out of our lives
[2:08:09] that's what the Bible looks like
[2:08:12] that's what our lives look like
[2:08:14] when it's all over
[2:08:16] regardless of what everybody on Earth
[2:08:17] thought about me
[2:08:19] what everybody thought maybe he's a
[2:08:21] little too this or he's too that or a
[2:08:22] religious fanatic but there's one that I
[2:08:25] really care about what he thinks about
[2:08:27] me
[2:08:29] and that's the one who I've given my
[2:08:31] heart to in my life to
[2:08:33] and that's the one who I'm Bound by
[2:08:34] chains of love to and I want to remain
[2:08:37] his prisoner but remember I'm a prisoner
[2:08:40] by my choice
[2:08:42] and I'm a prisoner without bars God's
[2:08:45] not forcing me I can make the other
[2:08:46] decision I can do something else and I
[2:08:48] can still be a Son of God Amen but I
[2:08:51] choose to stay imprisoned
[2:08:54] to Christ the word help us call if God
[2:08:57] bless you as we go I love you all thank
[2:08:59] you for bearing with me as I shared my
[2:09:01] heart God bless you brother
[2:09:05] it's Jesus

[2:09:17] for it Jesus
