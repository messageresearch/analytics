[0:00] go. There's there's things that have to
[0:02] happen to us. Now, all of a sudden, if
[0:04] I'm a dad and as a dad, I start to have
[0:07] a challenge in my house, in my
[0:09] household, in my family. How many How
[0:11] many of you have dad? Don't please don't
[0:12] raise your hand to this.
[0:16] You leave work a hero and you come home
[0:18] a zero and you didn't do anything.
[0:22] Everything was fine. Everybody was
[0:24] happy. And when I come home, you can
[0:26] feel the tension when you walk in the
[0:28] door and you know
[0:30] everything's about to pop. I have no
[0:32] idea. And I'm afraid to say anything to
[0:35] anybody.
[0:38] And you can just want to go turn around
[0:40] and go right back to work.
[0:42] If you don't realize that God placed me
[0:44] here to meet this challenge,
[0:47] &gt;&gt; that there's something in me that can
[0:49] overcome this challenge. Amen. and I can
[0:52] manifest Christ unto my family. And then
[0:54] you can stop for a minute before you
[0:57] before you make big mistakes and step on
[0:59] landmines and say, "God, you got to help
[1:01] me, Lord. If I surrender, will you come
[1:03] and work through me now?"
[1:06] &gt;&gt; Same thing for grandparents and and same
[1:08] thing for churches and same thing for
[1:10] businesses and places of work. It's it's
[1:12] all the same. There's got to be a
[1:14] challenge because the challenge is
[1:16] drawing character and virtue out of us.
[1:18] Amen. God doesn't want us to live in a
[1:20] perfect bubble and say, "Yeah, well
[1:22] done. You you you gained character. You
[1:24] learned how to rule and reign and you
[1:25] manifest my life." No. So now, instead
[1:29] of being afraid of the challenges, we
[1:31] need to step into the challenge and step
[1:33] up to the challenge. And it's not that
[1:36] we can do it in our flesh. And it's not
[1:38] like I've it's not like stand back
[1:40] everybody. I've got this. I mean, that's
[1:41] the wrong attitude.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; But for me, it's like God knew before
[1:46] the foundation of the world Amen.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; God's ordained every trial and he knew
[1:50] where I'd be and God put me in this
[1:53] position and he didn't put me here to
[1:57] fail.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; He put me here to manifest him.
[2:01] Sometimes we got to get stop just hit
[2:04] the pause button for a second and step
[2:05] back and reorder our thinking back to
[2:08] God's thinking because we we sometimes
[2:10] forget the big picture and we get stuck
[2:12] in the forest with the trees and we
[2:14] start reacting to what's going on around
[2:15] us and we forget that no trial comes
[2:18] unless it's first signed off by God and
[2:20] it's all for a purpose and that God
[2:23] picked me to be here and he picked this
[2:25] trial for me and there's something good
[2:27] going to come from it and I'm not
[2:28] running away from it but I'm going to
[2:30] stand here and I'm going to Say, God,
[2:31] give me the sensitivity to move forward
[2:33] the way you want me to move forward.
[2:35] Help me to say what needs said, do what
[2:37] needs done. Amen. To move forward and
[2:39] manifest you.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to live as a coward.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; But I don't want to miss God in
[2:47] simplicity.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; The simplicity of a problem at work, the
[2:52] simplicity of a problem at home, the
[2:55] simplicity of a problem amongst loved
[2:58] ones.
[2:59] That simplicity could be God hiding
[3:03] himself and then revealing himself in
[3:06] simplicity.
