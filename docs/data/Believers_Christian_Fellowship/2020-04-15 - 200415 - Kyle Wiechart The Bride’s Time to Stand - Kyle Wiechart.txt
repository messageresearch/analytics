========================================

[Music] that he's able to keep that which i've committed to him against that day praise the lord god bless you brothers we'll let you be seated for a minute i'd like for you to take out your bibles i'd like to read a psalm together as you can probably guess i'm not preaching tonight brother kyle's going to be taking the service for us and so i appreciate him being able to do that for us tonight i told him it's like a men's meeting praise the lord he just preached to the men but all the women are listening so you better be careful what you say amen so let's uh let's look at psalm 34 together i said so many times when you find yourself in trouble or when there's when there's chaos going on or things are upended the psalms are so comforting because that's how david found himself many times and he wrote the psalms out of times like that so they're very comforting so psalm 34 verse 1 let's read together i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them oh taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord ye sent you his saints for there is no want to them that fear him the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the lord shall not want any good thing come ye children hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of the lord what man is he that desireth life and love with many days that he may see good keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are upon open unto their cry the face of the lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken evil shall slay the wicked and and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trusted him shall be desolate amen what promise we have in the word what consolation we have in the word we must always keep the word before our eyes amen and that's what david was able to do in all of his trouble david knew who he was he knew he was the son of god he knew he was called of god and he knew who god was and if we can keep these two things in our mind all the time that we know who we are and we know who god is amen everything else comes into perspective we can't help things you know troubling news and and difficult situations we can't help them from having an effect on us in our minds and our emotions that's that's normal but there's something in the soul that knows where it came from and there's something in the soul longing to go back to where it came from that recognizes the word and recognizes the power and majesty of god and sometimes we just got to dig a little bit deeper till we hit that thing that sparks the life and say everything is under control nothing is out of kilter the clock's ticking right on time all these things has to be this way and rest comes back into our hearts and so that's where we find ourselves in troublesome times but praise god everything's okay everything all is well in my soul and in this in the scripture that we read how many times did he say he delivers them out of all their troubles all there's nothing that god is is not able to deliver us from all of our troubles amen and we thank god for that of the race god bless you all this evening good to see you brothers and uh thank you musicians i think that'll that'll be it for now i've been told my microphone's not on sorry is that better okay god bless you all so good to see you this evening and uh obviously it's a little strange it's just pointing out the obvious but uh i greet the invisible audience that's not with us i trust you're doing well and trusting there's a smile on your face as you're conducting yourselves with joy in the midst of trials that we're entering into by his predetermined will to accomplish and to bring about his great desire that he has in us i'll let you have your seats for just a moment okay if that's okay i knew i'd be a little bit nervous so i thought i'd maybe uh give you a couple updates here from some brothers just to talk for a little bit and relax myself you all right that nobody's going to complain are they so um i want to let everybody know that i heard from brother abraham brother alfred brother paddington for the dawn done by the james for the danny brother june and andre in the last 24 hours and it wasn't me reaching out to them they were reaching out to us and surprisingly they were pretty much all of them were letting us know they're praying for us and i thought that was really encouraging to hear and brother brother oswald was also he had said that his entire church were gathering i believe tonight at 6 pm or there tonight at 6 pm just to pray for us and they had been and he had been fasting and praying for us for the last four days and i just was really encouraged by that and i think you know well praise the lord we we really appreciate that little little difficulties like this seem to just kind of drive us all together i think that's a good thing in it right and um you know brother don don had let me know you know so we have some discomforts here obviously i would like to see everybody but you know brother don don had shared with me he says you know brother he says they've got armed militia at the entries of all of our cities i'm not allowed to leave my little village nobody's allowed in nobody's allowed out and brother abraham had mentioned to me he says you know i'm not even allowed to drive his personal car he sent me a voice message this morning not allowed to drive be on the public roads nothing and he says and we don't have the technology gadgets and such he said as you have to be able to stream uh really we're disconnected from the people so he said you know we're me and the d and they're i think it's illegal to have more than five he also said there's it's very serious over there um and everything is completely shut down and he had said you know we're just doing our best me and the deacons to go home to home and minister to the needs of the people individually so i liked that idea so if you see me standing outside your window and i'm waving to you i liked it so much i think i'm gonna start doing that so don't be shocked it's not a stranger don't shoot me i'm there to say hello god bless you and uh and be with you for a few minutes i like that i thought that would be a good thing god has a purpose in all of these difficulties and i did also want to let you know that also you know brother abraham um i well brother alfred we did send some funds to in malawi about 400 people and the problem is you know it's not america where we're all getting unemployment checks or a stimulus check they shut the entire country down all business shuts down they can do nothing and that really affects them severely and especially the poor that's amongst them because they like brother alfred said the food prices have doubled and tripled in these areas and the people aren't allowed to work they're not allowed to do anything to make any money and they live you know week by week so we've we've sent some funds there and lord willing will be able to send some more uh to help them and they so appreciated us being able to do that so just letting you know but keep them in prayer it's a tough time for them it seems like you know i think they used to say when america sneezes the rest of the world gets a cold so the little discomforts that we're feeling will magnify them by ten and that's what our brothers and sisters are experiencing in some of the third world countries and won't be mindful of that but also we were able to send some funds to brother james toronto he does a lot that the same things that brother don don does in the area of the country that he's he's placed and uh and also we did send some funds to brother don don and brother dawn dawn said that he was going to take those funds and distribute it about five other close brothers there to have churches and and do what they can to to buy as much food as they can so as more information comes be sure to share it with you and you know as always keep it in your prayers and lord moves on you anything just put something on the admissions on the tithe and we'll make sure we we get it to you get it to them as best we can so but god has a purpose in all these things it's nothing to be upset about god i i think it's a good thing i think discomfort is a good thing i think in any form and fashion it can come in it's a good thing we just get too comfortable as a people way way too comfortable and i think god has got to discomfort the bride i think he's got to push her and get her out of that nest so that she'll start to actually accomplish his great purpose and will and sometimes it's not always what you think and that's kind of something i want to talk about tonight i can only go as i feel led as i feel inspired and then when i'm done i'm done and so please give me enough grace to realize i have a little inspiration and i'm gonna deliver it and i feel uh inadequate to go any farther than that so um but we'll see where the lord wants to take that so if you'll stand with me now i'd like you to turn to ecclesiastes chapter 3. ecclesiastes chapters 3. now don't be too quiet on me either okay so there's not many people here but i like to hear your voices so you do anything you want to do just make more noise than you used to right so i like to know there's somebody before me speaking yeah so you you feel free you're quiet once brother jeremy i want to hear amends from the back yeah amen all right so good deal so ecclesiastes chapters 3 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the sun under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing i thought that's an interesting scripture that's not exactly the point of why i went to this and it'll you'll see it's a different and there's a reason sometimes you cannot just comfort someone when they really want comforted you create a hindrance for them right brother branham made a comment one time i think a brother told him he said brother branham if you let him lean on you today you'll be packing them tomorrow and he said that's right because that's human nature human nature does that so here is i believe that's in the reference by which he's saying it's not so much that there could be a time where they ban us from hugging each other i think it's there comes points and times in the maturing process of every son and every daughter you have to stand back and let them endure the difficulty in the situation that they find themselves to be in a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to rend and a time to sow a time to keep silence and the time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace and also if you will turn in your bibles to ephesians 6 10. ephesians 6 10 it says here finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins squirt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there and too with all perseverance and supplication for all saints i'd like to just title this little thought of bride's time to stand so if you will just bow your heads with me for a word of prayer most gracious heavenly father we always deem this an honor and a privilege that we can gather though we be few in number lord we are honored that we know you're here in our presence the word said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i am father we know that there's physical presence gathered here and there's also a presence online watching the service so lord we have us confidence in the promise of your word that you are with us now father god i just pray that you would take the words that will be spoken tonight and the things that we're looking at and lord will you just take it and anoint it and lord accomplish that which you have purposed it to accomplish for you promised in your word that your word would never return unto you void and father i know that i'm unable i know that i have no ability i have no confidence in myself i am walking out here by faith looking to you to take me lord to move me to anoint me lord recognizing i cannot do anything without you and every time i failed you is when i thought i could do something lord i realize i'm inadequate at this hour so father god i just pray that you would take this time take the words take me move me out of the way take the people move them out of the way give them the ears to hear and eyes to see the things that you want us to see so that we conduct ourselves the way that would please you father we love you we thank you in jesus name amen you may be seated it is just too quiet so so uh so here we go on sunday you all know god deals with me a little bit funny at this point so i i always like to make sure that um that if if god's in something i share it with you because i i feel this this position really scares me it always has scared me it's a very scary thing to stand behind a pulpit very scary thing and i don't ever take it lightly and so god knows i'm just so utterly dependent upon him that i just don't ever know what to say or how to move or even what to bring to the people unless i know he's led me to say something and so on sunday i so enjoyed the service on sunday and and uh i was writing down some notes and really enjoying the service and as i'm sitting there um i know when god starts to bring an anointing or it just starts to bring a little something to me and i felt it swoop back over there across me and when he does i go to the other side of the page from where i'm writing notes for brother chad and i just write i just started writing down some thoughts and and i had a funny feeling when that happens usually i get asked to minister and actually i sat there and i thought oh he's going to ask me he's going to ask me and i mean i'm before the lord that was the truth i just started writing notes and i thought i don't want to right now i don't i really don't want to so uh so as i was sitting there and i wrote down those notes i had um i wrote down some different things and one of the things i wrote down was she's built to stand and and i i wrote down the pyramid and the enoch and i wrote down the two fathers and i started to think about it for just a moment just the thought past my mind i said you know the devil trains his children and constantly puts them in a position where they're utterly dependent upon him for everything they need his alcohol they need his cigarettes they need his entertainment they need his women they need his uh luxuries constantly to bring them joy peace satisfaction any of the things that we have by a free gift of almighty god he creates such a dependency upon himself and he keeps him so tied to him that they can't even function in this world without his devices and i had remember one time at my office there there was a lady that she she worked in our office and and she always had an earbud in i said what are you listening to all the time and she said oh this and she turned it up on her on her computer and it's just like hard rock and roll i said my goodness i said that thing would drive me crazy if i listen to that she said if i didn't listen to it i would go crazy and i see so the devil this is how he trains his children he gets them into an utter reliance and need for him to just stay sane in this insane world and it's a paradox it's really an odd thing but i got to thinking too but my father trains me differently our father is training us to be able to stand against everything the devil could shoot our way or bring our way and it doesn't matter i don't i honestly believe that that the sign of maturity is a complete utter independence by a dependence on his word that i don't need anything but a revelation of my position in christ who i am what he's done for me and that word because i know heavens and earth pass away but that word never fails and as long as i have that revelation i know who i am i know what i where i've came from i know what he's done for me i also know i'm not what i want to be but i know i'm not what i used to be i got a lot of other things i could look at and be like well but i know what he's brought me from and i know where i'm standing and nobody can has to tell me and nobody can persuade me otherwise i know who i am and i know where i'm standing and so i stand on that solid rock and god has given me an independence from the themes of this world i don't need any of the devices that the world could offer me i have a joy unspeakable and nothing of the world is giving it to me anymore you're finding yourselves joyful you lost your job and you're happy you're at home with the family you've got more time to listen to sermons praise god this is an you are a paradox to this world aren't you sad aren't you concerned aren't you fearful no i have a revelation i'm his i'm his son i'm his daughter if you're online there's no sisters i'm talking to but nonetheless you know you have a revelation of this position in christ and it creates such a boldness such a boldness to be able to stand in the midst of every obstacle that comes our way right so as i wrote down those notes and then i walked outside and brother chad be lined it over to me and then he asked me is i knew you were going to ask me man okay so you know i uh i i but i never know what i'm going to preach i know sometimes i think you know like a minister's just got these stacked sermons he's just ready to come out there that is the farthest thing from here i didn't even know what i was totally preaching i still don't know what i'm preaching so come on now i really have no clue you're right brother ben you don't really know you think you know and you think you come up here to do this and he wants to take you this way you just i just don't know and then so you know so i all i know to do is consecrate myself get in the word stay in the word feed on the word keep my mind constantly meditating ask him lord what do you want for your people i've got nothing to glory in i really don't care what anybody thinks about me if you'll just give me something that brings you glory and it helps your people i'll be happy with it let me be a bastion the whole thing i really don't care and so as i'm as i'm preparing and and looking at listening to things i start listening to why christ speak and as i'm listening to why christ speak my you know something inside of me is like i'm ready i'm let let me go let me where's the son that i need to call and stand still right i'm like let me after the enemy i ain't gonna cry to you god i'm i'm ready to take the head off the enemy get out of the way right and as i'm listening to that that's where that's kind of the inspiration i'm going in and he point blank stop me point blank flat out nope not it so i want to take your attention back to ephesians 6. if you still have your bibles open because this is a bit of a paradox in ephesians 6 finally my brethren be strong in the lord in the power of his might putting on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore taken to you the whole armor of god that you may be able withstand in the evil day having done all to stand stand therefore having your going loin skirt about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace so you read this and you in my mind i'm looking at i'm like got my sword i've got my shield i've got the imputed righteousness of jesus christ given unto me i've got the helmet of salvation checking out my shoes i got the i got my feet shot with the preparation the gospel buddy watch out here i go demons i'm coming after you and i said father just give me the word i'm ready he says stand still stand still like what you know all of us brother the same way we're like give me a sword in my hand i'm i'm cutting something something's getting cut you know something but that's how we feel that's how we put us in the position you know i'm listening to why christ speak i'm saying man i ain't crying i ain't crying i'm ready you get out of my way here i come devil i'm coming after you and everybody you got you know and i'm looking and he stops me in my tracks and i realize whoa hold on why would he adorn me with such armament i know i ain't going no picnic but i'm fully dressed out for battle and he's telling me stand still i don't want to stand still you know sometimes brother branham says you know the holy spirit is an action in you sometimes in our own carnal humanity we're looking for the people to be in certain action and then we'll believe or then we won't have the insecurity that we once had you know many things we're looking for god to use us in such a way because we have an insecurity we don't really have a revelation we know who we are we're looking for god to vindicate us we're looking for something on the outward appeal that'll be i i got it see god or the other people will see yeah see he's with us and that's insecurity that's not based upon a revelation a revelation i don't care what anybody thinks ten thousand fall on my right hand ten thousand fall on my left don't bother me i'm standing on a solid rock revelation i don't need an action and outward action because there's an inward action and that inward action brings me into this lord i'm ready to go but if you say stand i won't move i'm ready to go you've got me in position i fully believe the word the father i'm tempted to go there's people they're trying to get me out there i want to go cut off the head of demon the lord if you don't want me to i'll stand right here and i got to thinking about that today and i got to think you know there's another group maybe there's another group they've they're fully arrayed in garments you know and they say what do you mean stand still no no i've got faith to move mountains no no no see i'm ready to get my body to be burned no no i'm i'm ready i know that's what my chief captain's saying but i've got the faith to put it into action you know what he'll say right ahead go go right ahead i told you to stand still you wanted to go go right ahead you know what the follow-up bill will be depart from you worker of iniquity i don't know you my word couldn't find a resting place in you you had my word i told you stand still so i'm i'm wanting to go why christ speak lord tell me to go i'm ready to defy the government i'm ready to just blast through a whole you know and i wonder sometimes if there isn't just a time to hold your peace and be silent because ecclesiastes says there's a time for war and there's a time for peace there's a time to tear something down and then there's time to take the time to sew it back up there's time to give an embrace and then there's time to let them stand on their own it's because god's raising up a ch an army a royal seed his children have to come to a full maturity you know i want to be you know depart red sea you know but you know before moses could get to that point he had an 80-year training process he had a point to where he got to the voices lord i can't speak i can't do nothing i am a miserable failure everything i've ever done look at me i'm old i'm worn out finally moses finally it took forever but i got you where i want you just now finally got you where i want you now you'll just do what i want you to do nothing more nothing less you'll just do what i want you to do right you won't turn to the right you won't turn to the left you don't have any more will you're not trying to prove anything to anybody else you have one purpose one desire that's just to do what i've asked you to do i may cause you to stand there and be ridiculed and made fun of and abased before all men but if that's what i want you to do moses you'll do it now you wouldn't do it before there was just too much of moses there but you'll do it now because now i finally got you or i can use you so before he could you know call for those the party in the red sea and any of those things he had a process to go through you know jacob had before he could tell that son to stand still he had a process he had to go through he had to be sure that he would only do what the word said do he was told to go around the city one time in one day you go around the city one time in one day two on the second day two in the second day seven on the seventh day seventh on the seventh day you do exactly what the word tells you you hold your peace and then when i tell you to scream out you scream out don't do nothing until i tell you what to do sometimes gonna tell you to move sometimes i'm going to tell you to stop but you have to follow the very whisper of my command you know god likes to test his children just to see how they're going to respond it's not always lemmy adam i think you're ready for it but he just says wait for my nod then i'll tell you to go right and it's counter to a personal man type of a personality but i think it's very complementary to the nature of jesus christ in the believer and so as i'm listening to why christ speak i i walked out i was just praying just talking the lord and i walked into my office and i picked up a all my oh my i had about a 150 sermons and just sitting there i just reached in i just grabbed one i was going to read something before i go to bed you know so i i look i go oh that's a pretty good one christ the mystery of god revealed you know that's a pretty good thing to read before we go to bed right and i just opened it up and i opened it up to this page and i say i looked at this first part mind if i just read it okay with this we got nowhere to go right no so it says this is god's great mystery of love expressed that god and man became one see the whole thing is god in man one god and man was one there and god and man won here see what is it being filled with his spirit and him having the preeminences that was god's achievement that's god's purpose to do that that he might be in christ in christ in us and all of us together one the holy spirit the same thing it revealed it to christ reveals it here the supernatural creative power mind if i keep reading remember think of it that people born of his spirit in a day like this in this great denominational age that we live and the living god takes his living word and vindicates it personally this life that's in the word the germ that's in that seed and the word is the seed that the sower went forth and to sow and the life is christ in the word personally in you vindicating something that you cannot do proving himself that it's not you it's him and you've become one a love slave to him to be his bride so as you can tell i'm getting excited as i'm reading this and these are the thoughts in my mind so let's just keep reading his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a vindication of the great revelation of god look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual it's not a group it's a personal vindication of a pregnant child of god filled with the holy ghost so surrendered to god that he don't care about anything else the holy spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal vindication of the word itself being expressed to the people to the world so then i flip the page and i look at the top and i had written down the bride stand a few years ago just the last time i wrote it down but this is the exact same thing i wrote down on sunday built to stand and i wrote down the bride stand so let's see what is the bride stand it's an individual and one person and all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth so you're telling me the the devil has one major objective keeping the individual from an individual revelation of his position in christ and his ability to stand on the word even if nobody else stands so i wonder maybe the separation from our brethren maybe the isolation from the ability to lean upon the strength of the group might be serving the great purpose of god and backfiring on the devil he might be thinking if i can keep him separated if i can keep them frustrated if i can keep them in such a condition where they cannot come together they cannot hear from the word of god being preached maybe this will be the thing that separates them and breaks them up and loosens them i wonder if it'll backfire i'm getting text messages from brothers overseeing saying brother this was a blessing i'm not as busy i'm home with my family my kids you know what we're doing we're feeding on the word day and night wow this could be a good thing i just choose to believe that all things work together for the good to them that love the lord right no matter what it looks like it's serving his purpose he knows what he's doing and i think he wants more than anything to know for you to know that you can stand with him alone on that word just alone i don't need the strength of the pastor i don't need the group i don't need the families i have him i've got the word he's personally revealed himself to me i think god likes to break up tradition i think he likes to break up routine i really really really do i think he likes to discomfort her i think he's got a purpose in it so he says not them but him as you see to an individual not a group always an individual hells all against it but his mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one that could see it but all the mystery is revealed only as he has promised to his bride hell is against this truth the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it for that's her stand why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal his hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some pastor you let somebody else get it out of you when you know that way down in your heart that you're thirsting and you're hungry it's god trying to reveal it to you see the revelation for the last day is here wow so maybe just maybe god is creating a set of circumstances allowing the devil to do whatever he wants to do but it's just setting up the circumstances to embolden the bride like she's never been emboldened before to bring her in a greater consecrated state that she realizes i can do nothing without him i can't do nothing without him god likes to break routines just so you can realize that sometimes and i'd like you to turn to psalms 1. psalms 1 1 says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be then say they them group large group he said and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also will not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper and the interesting thing about here it really doesn't matter if the rain stops raining this tree is connected to the river and the power source from the very depths of its roots and you can't see those roots you can't see anything a man could be standing right by the tree and says it hasn't rained for weeks but this tree keeps getting bigger wonder why because there's something underneath there's something hitting there's something not public it's not a public show there's something's hidden down underneath nobody can see it there's no big uproar about it what's going on i can't believe this tree is flourishing how is it flourishing they're disconnected they're discombobulated i've got them fractured i've got them upset how are they blossoming like a rose how are they growing in strength because they connected they connected to that life source and they know that they as long as they just keep stay connected and keep drawing in from that resource right there everything they have need of is provided for them and i taught this to my girls i got a big piece of paper out did a family devotion the other night and i just drew this great big tree connected to this water source and i was talking to him my girls and i brought up brother chad's sermon they see these little seeds here honey i said these little seeds you know sometimes we get upset at humanity but humanity serves god's purpose too you know i had to be god planted his little germ of life into the betting ground of this humanity right here you know why because he knows that humanity will die under the right conditions that little seed will die under the right conditions it'll break apart and then you know he'll use humanity he'll use your brothers and sisters sometimes right the bible says heresies must deeds become so that they that are approved among you may be made manifested so god allows little problems allows a wife allows a husband allows a brother allows a pastor to say something to hurt you sometimes just to check you just to shake you up right sometimes you need a little spanking you need a little shock to your system to get you to wake up to something brother jeremy i think you told me years ago an apple tree if it's not bringing forth apples by the laundry antonia you take a stick and you beat the tree that makes no sense to me but apparently it works if you hit that tree with a stick it does something to shock its system and it comes and starts bringing forth life i did know this because i used to do some planning and stuff like that and if you have a root bound plant you have to cut up its roots you have to almost traumatize the thing so that it goes into action and sends forth those roots down deep and takes a grip of the soil so that it can live you have to do something to shock it because it's not producing and sometimes god has to do something to the bride to shock her system to wake her up to bring forth the fruit that she's supposed to in his season but you're never going to do it if you just constantly are relying upon the rain to fall upon you the ministry to spay everything you need it to be said to the brothers and the sisters to come to you and lift you up when you're down you have a source god's in our midst he proves himself over and over and time and time again and yet you want to be discouraged you want to be upset your brother hasn't lifted you up nobody's calling you nobody's checking in on you what is that to you you've got a connection to the river of life we're not shocked who we're not dismayed we're not a people dismayed we know the hour in which we're living we know where he's at he's in our presence he's in our midst we have everything we have need of not to survive but to thrive under any condition that this world comes into i don't i can't put up with anything else i you'd be upset you'd be frustrated you get down i'm sorry i have nothing to be frustrated i have nothing to get down about god is so creating the environment you know god created a certain virus just reminds me brother man what you said there about jesus the scene had to be set god had to get everything just into a right condition so that his masterpiece could go on display everything that the political system the ecumenical system the people you think about it one day before they have palms in their hands saying hosanna hosanna we bless you god i mean they're excited the very next day they're saying they're crying out for his blood let his blood be upon us crucify him how could the people switch that quick what happened to them what spirit swept over the people where one day they didn't have a problem maybe they didn't know that he was hosanna but they didn't have a problem with him yeah a little bit strange right you know but we got no issue with those people they're in the word yeah they're a little strange they've got some strange beliefs you know just like jesus yeah i had some training but we don't understand what's going on right they just left him alone but boy when the system changed just a little bit you get things in a little bit of funny condition you start to bring about a fear in the people you don't know what the government system is going to do i'll tell you what they'll turn really really quick and if anything these things that are happening are just setting the stage for a b system to have total authoritative control over the entire world but what is that to us what is that to us we don't care it's got to be in those conditions god's masterpiece is going to be put on display again he's got a bride that he's going to say look here she is so simple so humble not going to be sometimes the things we want it to be i really sometimes want to be out bring me the sick let's go to the hospital you know every one of you feel like that sometimes you're like take me to the hospital i'm ready clear them out i got the word i know who i am i know my position i believe it have confidence in it and he sometimes he just stand still be quiet jesus walked by all those men at the pool of bethesda to one man he was in complete obedience to one his heavenly father he only did those things that he was shown to do and he did nothing more that's a real test for the bride when you have full power full authority you could do whatever you need to do there he was the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelling in one form spit on ripping his beard out of his face mocking him and ridiculing him he's there to help them to save them the very one he's there to help and to save they're beating him spitting in his face and he's so high that heaven has to look up to see him holy sh seraphins and cherubians screaming holy holy in his presence and here you are beating him and you know what the amazing thing was he did nothing he did nothing he had a right to do it he had the ability to do it he could have done it but he didn't have the go-ahead to do it it would have broken the whole plan of god so sometimes i honestly believe god will put the bride into position she could change the scene in a heartbeat she could really flip this thing upside down but she won't have permission to do it she's going to be ready to move and he's going to be saying stand down just stand still just be quiet i'm serving my great purpose i think god likes to do that with his people brother branham said well i want to read this first though the proverb says that he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh the city yeah god's great achievement is you the devil's not the problem the devil is not the the the major achievement here right no you're the major achievement yeah you're the one you're the one that he's he's working he's constantly he's bringing trial and tribulation difficulty and they all have custom-made trials just made for you but he's working to get you surrendered to him get you into that complete submitted state no matter what i bring you you stand still because you've been connected with me nothing shakes you right nothing so brother banham said this in perfect strength through perfect weakness god sent us a prophet that will take the word of god that would will not take something else but would but just get empty vessels if god can just get them empty vessels and then take the word of god and pour it into that person not say oh i shook when i received it oh i spoke in tongues when i received oh i danced in the spirit forget it forget it just stay there until it comes till that vessel is so full that's it that's the way you do it yes sir the simplicity of it the vessels were all filled up how oh how we could stay on that isaiah 53 says he was oppressed he was afflicted and yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living and from the transgression of my people he was stricken the greatest of all beaten stricken bruised and he doesn't do anything and i'm standing before another royal seed a royal priesthood that has more power than she thinks she really does my god is also conditioning her to only respond and move when he says move see that's a great paradox full power and full ability but completely under submission complete under control that's a good father that's a heavenly father that's he's training us the proper way right brother bam says this says jesus with his head back walking on and the priest screaming at him making fun of him others were crying hosanna but did you notice whole burden of the whole world rested upon him calvary the dark hours of gethsethme was laying before him oh has he went he never noticed their scoffing you know when someone says something evil about you and you want to take it up and get angry about it that just shows that you haven't went quite deep enough yet with god big men don't do those things that's what made him god to me he was big he didn't have to notice their little scoffings he had a purpose he had a work to do and that was to fulfill what god had sent him to do and he was determined to do it he didn't care what anyone said and the lord just dropped it on my heart so i want to say this the last time i ministered i said something wrong and it just now hit me by the chad all right with it but i feel i have to so if you remember we were talking about those eagles and that eagle and that squirrel and that uh that little chatter chatter chatter of this girl not that anything was wrong with that it was the right thought there but i was saying you know that eagle got he just got frustrated with that squirrel the chatter chatter chatter days of miracles over chatter chatter chair denying the present tense reality of god right finally that ego just gets the points i'm just sick and tired of it right and that's true god allowed that squirrel to be there god allows those squirrels to be in our midst in this hour but i had said something i said i hope you can read between the lines and it's not that that wasn't right but i said it with the wrong motive and objective and i wanted to apologize that just it just hit me again and i had told the lord if i had the opportunity i'd make that right before the people and i told brother chad that wasn't right i shouldn't have said that as soon as i said i grieved him i knew i grieved him right then it just made me sick to my stomach but i think god is very interested in our motive and our objectives and these hours i really think that god is going to allow many squirrels and you know what they're serving their purpose i'm not going to be upset i'm not going to ridicule i'm not going to make fun of i'm not going to do anything they're serving their purpose and really who are we to say they're wrong if you think about it they may be wrong but they may be right they may be serving his purpose which makes them right you know pharaoh served his purpose pharaoh wasn't right but pharaoh served god's purpose and god continually hardened his heart because god was serving because god had a great plan and pharaoh had to serve his purpose and that's what i i i wanted to apologize for that and i hope you that you understand that i i i don't want to ever say anything with a wrong motive and objective and something bothers him and i need to make that right so i can make mistakes um we all can and i trust that god will correct us when we're wrong and we'll have we'll be humble enough to say lord that's right i i'm not here to glory glory in anything there's nothing good about me anyhow you're the only good one among us and i think sometimes god will maybe allow a minister to make mistakes like that sometimes mess up really bad just so god doesn't have to share his glory with anybody and you know he the littler we can get the bigger he can get in us i think brother banham said he's only as big as as you allow him to be maybe i'm getting that wrong as or as little as you can become that's how big he can be in you so i want to make sure that we do those things so that was on my mind i'll get that off there and just move brother branham also says here he says now what was he yesterday now if he was if he was a rich man yesterday he'd be a great rich man today but when he come yesterday we find out that he didn't even have a place to come lay his head that's right the birds all have nests and the foxes have dens but he didn't even have a place to lay his head he had he came to the world but he had to borrow a womb to be born in they had no cradle for him to even be laid in so they laid him in a box of straw when he died he was nailed to a roman tree under capital punishment he had no he had one robe put on it it had been made for him woven throughout with one scene without a scene he had to borrow a grave even to be buried in so there's none of us that that was that bad off he come to show what god was anything that's high and haughty isn't god god is low and humble that's what made him god see something that comes low not them that goes high so god doesn't dwell in ark or hierarchies and things he dwells in humility and the way up is to humble yourself and you'll be exalted exalt yourself and you'll be humbled that's right see god knows how to do it you have to remember humble yourself before god don't try to think your own thoughts just think his thoughts because the whole christian armor is unseen a christian doesn't look at what he can see with the natural now you look the only way you can be a christian you've got to believe god you you can't see now look watch there the whole christian armor is love joy faith long suffering patience meekness gentleness holy spirit see and all of those things are the unseen things they're unseen but those things that are unseen are the only reality it's the unseen things and i hope it's okay i'll just keep reading these i just i get encouraged by them brother branham also says here and why i'm against organized religion that's the way god does the church he beats every creed every denomination and every man-made dogma until he sees his own life reflecting if i do not the works of my father then believe me not see if what is its purpose to the church the life that was in christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you don't got the patience or the virtue and all of those things and the temperance and the things and the godliness and the brotherly kindness and all those things that's required of you no matter what you've done and no matter how much you've shouted and how many churches you've joined how many feathers you've pinned onto yourself don't do it wait until that genuinely from your heart you can forgive till in your heart you have such a brotherly kindness that no matter if they were to pull a handful of the beard from your side you could turn the cheek to the other side in sweetness with all of those virtues no matter what they should say about you i think god wants his bride in that kind of a condition she's bone of his bone life of his life power of his power spirit of his spirit right god is going to put his bride in a position you can rip this side of my cheek out and if you want to you can rip this side out you can say whatever you want and i'll say god bless you lord help you i ain't gonna say nothing i'll just be quiet that's what he wants to see i will admit i'm not quite there let's just be honest but that's what i desire and only he can change my desires and i'm thankful i'm hungering for it and i'm thirsting for it and he said he gave me a promise if you hunger and thirst for righteousness you'll be filled i want that righteous life of jesus christ so manifesting in me you could crucify me and i'll only try to do what i can to help you along the way that's the desire i got you know that's a different kind of strength that's a strength that is opposite of what the world calls strong but a real strength is to be able to harness your own uh will your own abilities and say lord not my will be done thy will be done amen the bible says here as many ours are the oh for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for we have not received a spirit of bondage unto fear but we've received the spirit of adoption whereby we are crying out abba father the spirit itself is bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs and heirs of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us so there's no glory to be revealed in us outside of a certain aspect of suffering that must go along with it they kind of go part and parcel if you want to be glorified with him you have to suffer with him right and there's a plenty of suffering i think to come as she continues to stand on his word to only do what he says to do when she says to do it when he says to do it right and i wanted to look at this you know remember the story of david and he's a rejected king and he's leaving the city and there's a man there to spit upon him along the way yeah let me just read it but yet look at david when he was going out he was exiled from his own people rejected king his own daughter had been ravaged by his by by her brother and the brothers all killed him and there he was absalon raised up separated the army causing a revolution and david his own father was was excommunicated see taken away rejected by his own people going out of the city there was this little crippled up fella dragging along uh there making fun of him and spitting at him and a guard pulled his sword and said i'll let the dog that dog's head stay on him spitting on my king david said you let him alone god told him to do it and you remember also brother branham was in a situation like that as well the tax collectors were bothering him constantly constantly even got the prophet of god to lie to him right he had to make that confession make that right before the people and before his wife got him so wound up and brother vail and was kind of talked to him one day and i think all the ministers kind of get one i said brother man how do you act like that you know if it was kind of me i'd i'd put them in their place and smart man like that brother bob said he could probably do it too he said but you know maybe just let him alone maybe god's telling him to do that thing you know and so many times i think that there's plenty of obstacles and there's many opposition there may be many that make fun of but i think maybe god would allow it and maybe it's not a time to draw a sword it's not the time to fight it's time to be able to have such a yielded spirit to his will that you can just stand say lord i know who i am i know where i'm standing and i know you're with me i don't fight back yeah it's an interesting thing so to take the bride taking a stand in this hour i'm sorry to disappoint you brothers i think everybody is there i'm ready to take my stand government's shutting down gonna shut us all down i'm ready take my stam ready go into action i'm ready to fight by taking your stand you may say stand still just be quiet stand silent remember this is his purpose and his will i think it kind of may be fitting stand still and see the salvation of our god god may create the circumstance look impossible and no doubt he will and he's going to say stand still watch what i'm going to do for her he's waiting to show himself mighty on his on our behalf our only responsibility is to not waver at that ability is to believe it trust it ready for it remember the man the the husband defends the wife the wife doesn't need to defend him right you know someone's trying to break in my house and my wife's like step back kyle i got him but we got problems we got some issues no i got this you know we'd have some issues i think god's the same way yeah right honey i got this i'm going to create a bunch of circumstances because i want to show my strength to you honey you just stand still be quiet you just trust me you have confidence in me you love me right yeah just watch what i'm going to do next it's going to get good will you stand with me i'm sorry very rambling and i told you i'm going to share the thought and then i'm done so musicians if you could come so as bad as we all may want hey it's time for why christ speak and i do believe those times come i'm not taking away from those things but i think we have to be led of the spirit to know when to be quiet and when to speak when to fight when to not when to rend when to sew up when to embrace and when not to it's a it's a time where we really need holy ghost leadership like we've never done before and i think we need to take every opportunity that god has given us in these times like this to really connect to that living water that water that never runs dry that will never fail you that promise would always be with you even in you to the end of the world this is a blessed opportunity that god has given us to mold us to shape us to mature us to where we're not relying upon maybe the pastor we don't have access to him as much maybe the deacons maybe the sisters can't really talk to the other sisters and communicate they can talk to their husbands now like maybe they should have been from the beginning sorry i don't see any sisters so i could say that but i know i'll pay a price for that sorry but you know what i mean sometimes we lean too much on each other and i don't think that pleases god i really don't believe that that place is our lord i think we need to be conscientious of what he's trying to achieve in each of us remember god and man won god and man one yeah and say god and two men three just one brother you got a song it has a deer i love that yeah as the deer painted full the water so my soul and you [Music] is [Music] [Applause] to you you alone are my hearts desire and i long to worship [Music] you are my friend and you are my brother even though you are my king so much more [Music] my [Music] you [Music] is [Music] you [Music] is [Music] my to you alone does my spirit [Music] [Music] is [Music] gracious heavenly father lord we just love you and we thank you father lord we confess to you lord we make so many mistakes so many times we get in our own way father and father god we're living in such an hour i'm living with such a desire in my heart and i know my brothers and sisters are as well lord that we could just be so fully yielded lord to know when we are to move when we're to speak when we're to be silent father lord it's our hearts desire to be such in a yielded place that you could use us when you want to use us and only realize it's for your glory and your glory only father we love you we need you lord we just commit ourselves to you lord thinking of those that aren't here i miss them i pray lord should be with them every brother every sister every child lord lord comfort them lord and be with them party your word is true and it never fails so we have this confidence that you stick closer to us than a brother father so lord just take the words i know it's broken up but father maybe i trust and believe that it accomplished your purpose father may it bring us all in a place of a greater level of humility and a humble us father lord we know that it's not us i'm my problem lord we are all our own problem we we try to think things through we try to make uh try to figure things out and that's what cripples us and hinders your ability to have the preeminences that you want father so lord i want to stand like a dumb sheep i don't know what to say i won't know what to do i'm just trusting father you'll give me the nod when it's ready to do something father we want to live our lives always ready and in action but lord always just ready suited in that armor that you've given to us ready to move when you said move father and ready to stand still and see the glory of god the salvation of the lord father bless us all as we travel home lord bring us together again soon lord we pray in jesus name amen [Music] i'm gonna read one more as you're coming since you waited i just saw it in why christ speak notice how beautiful oh i love this you know finally pharaoh got to the point he said get out of here god just plagued him with the voice of moses he struck everything he done everything there was that he needed to do he stopped the sun or he put the sun down in the middle of the day he done everything else he blackened the days he brought forth the frogs the fleas the lice and everything the smoke the fire death of families and everything else he done everything until finally said pharaoh pharaoh had to say you get out of here take it all and go oh my praise god i'm so glad that a man can can so completely serve god till he the devil don't know what to do with him that's right just obey god so completely to the devil says oh my get away i don't want to hear any of it anymore that's right just get away so completely surrendered that's my desire so completely chat [Music] praise the lord you know god is stretching every one of us but in ways we didn't expect to be stretched you know we we we're accustomed to facing difficulty we've gotten accustomed to facing ridicule and scorn and hardship in different ways but we haven't become accustomed to inactivity to doing nothing that is a new kind of trial right you know shake off the restrictions shake off everything and who cares but god cares god's allowed it he's backed us into a corner and he wanted us backed into a corner i was talking to a brother the other day i said i feel like an eagle stuck in a keg we can fly we know we can fly we know there's nothing that can stop the word that's being expressed in the bride it's come in full power the full life of jesus christ is present with this word we know it and there's no doubt in our hearts about it that if god would drop in our hearts to speak we know we could speak and we know it would happen i feel like a k i feel like a an eagle that's got all its primary feathers fit the fly everything it can do and stuck in a cage and can go nowhere i was just expressing frustration the other day and i said the most frustrating thing is god put me in the cage that's the most frustrating part of it all is that god has put me in the cage because this is what he wants right now and and i'm trying not to be frustrated because it's god this message was perfect for me we want to obey every order of the chief captain we don't want to be a rogue army we don't want to be renegades creating more problems because all we want to do is fight amen i believe there's a fighting side to god i believe there's a nature of a warrior in god and i believe we've picked it up but there's also a lamb nature and a sacrificial nature too and there's both jesus could plat together a ropes and he could drive out the money chasers and flip over the tables and run about as a madman and when they were lashed on the back it really stung and the same one could be silent when he was accused there's two sides and sometimes god asks us to take one side and sometimes he asks us to take the other side and sometimes in our nature we want this side but sometimes he asks us to do something totally contrary to our nature so that he can have preeminence in full control i appreciated that so much sometimes he'll weaken the ministry amen why because he wants first place sometimes he'll weaken the physical church as i said physical church the physical church the physical church setting the dynamics and the power and and the move of the spirit with the congregation coming together and singing hundreds at a time amen in the pull on the word he'll weaken the physical church so he can have preeminence and when it's his time then let him do what he wants to do that's what i'm learning i think the quote says i may be misquoting but there's plenty of you who will correct me if i get it wrong power under control is fit to rule not we've got power there's no question fullness of the word with the fullness of the life here to back it up every claim but it's got to be power under control that's fit the rule and sometimes god will do the very thing we don't want him to do to prove whether or not he's got control [Music] amen [Music] you know i love the lord even when he does things that i didn't want him to do i love him anyways even when he gets us in a situation that we don't want to be in and he tells you to sit still and you don't want to sit still and he tells you to submit and you don't want to submit i still love him anyways i say this has been a trial for me god has really been breaking me and breaking me because when god puts the heart of a shepherd into a man he has the heart of a shepherd you can't help it and that's something god does supernaturally it's not something you ask for it's not something i had before but when god called me to be a pastor he put in me the heart of a shepherd and all that i want to do the only thing i want to do is see all the sheep gathered together i want to know everyone's okay and i want to see every face and i and i want to have a connection while i'm preaching the word and connect with each one of the sheep that's all i want in the whole world if i could have if i could have my greatest desire right now would be have all the sheep together and i could see each one and god is breaking me friends because i can't help that that's my desire i can't help that's the greatest longing that i have right now for us all to be together but god is saying no and he's breaking me because i'm learning who the real shepherd is no matter what he's put in my heart he can put us in any situation he wants and tell us to be quiet and i just want to have enough love for him to say it's okay if it breaks me if i weep tears if i stay up in the night crying over it it's okay if that's what he wants that's what we want this is a real breaking time friends this is a real molding time it's a real proving time in ways we never dreamed i appreciate brother kyle being willing to bear a soul and apologize it was one small statement he made and it was a true statement he just knew it was in the wrong spirit it was in the wrong motive and god could correct him to me he's more endeared to me than he ever was before because he'd be willing to make that right say god make us right more than anything i want to be right i want to be pleasing to the lord if everybody else thinks i'm crazy as long as i can please him i'll be happy if everybody thinks i've done wrong and made the wrong choice that's okay as long as heath knows i made the right choice that's all that matters to me to be pleasing to him is the greatest desire of my life and it's becoming more so and friends it won't be too many more days that we will have zero regrets it won't be too long until there won't be one regret left they will know that it was all worth it when everything fades away and everything changes amen and and we see him in a translated body and we have a body like unto his and we see him as he is amen it'll all be worth it it'll all be worth it let's make that our goal that we strive towards god bless your friends let's all get stretched together let let all of our ideas about what the showdown's going to be like let it all get crushed amen every idea of what a trial is going to look like and how the bride will overcome hard trials just let him smash it right now because the way he wants his bride to overcome is to look like she's weak and feeble and incapable and unable of doing anything amen and uh all he's doing is roping the devil in getting him close for a kill because she looks incapable she looks uh you know flawed and failed and like she's not capable of producing anything but oh praise god if that's what my father wants to lure the devil a little closer then that's what he can have he could have my weakness he can have my inabilities he can have it all if that's what he wants to exploit is our inability then he can have it as long as he's pleased the bride stand oh inactivity is hard amen we're home more than we've ever been home before and when we were working we think oh it'd just be so good if i could just be home if i just didn't have to go if i just had some time and then god gives you some time and it's like oh if i could just go to work if i just had something else to do you realize god is breaking us god is breaking everything god is changing and shaking up everything so he can have it exactly the way he needs it to do what he wants to do when he wants to do it and i say god you can have it if you don't tell me what to do i won't do anything i say very much that's the way i felt lately he hasn't told me what to do so there's nothing i can do we just do what we can we submit to what we have to submit to because he hasn't told us what to do we just wait for the lord move forward by faith asking god to lead us step by step because we don't have this thing figured out we don't have tomorrow figured out we don't have the next service figured out all we know is that we want him to be in absolute control of me god can make it look bad and then he can make it look worse [Music] are we willing to let him do that that's a good question are we willing to let him are we willing to let him make us look like the fools so that he can accomplish this goal are we willing i want to be willing i can just say i want with all my heart i want to be willing it's hard the inactivity is hard the weakness is hard the doing nothing is hard the feeling like your wings are pinned down and you're shoved into a cage when you know that you can fly you know that you can speak you know that you believe the word you know that you can overcome and god says be still that's hard but i want it i want him i want him to have absolute control and preeminence in me we love you appreciate you guys coming out tonight appreciate the atmosphere you create you created and i tell you even preaching like this is is a stretching a preacher right brother kyle god's stretching us god is training us god is mo he's breaking everything that was normal and he and he's he's putting us positions that are uncomfortable and not easy and he's stretching us but praise the lord he's stretching us amen everybody might get a chance to preach like this god's stretching us but i love him anyhow amen you see us unpleasing sing this song together before we go [Music] be pleasing to [Music] be pleasing [Music] please to you let everything i do be pleasing to you let everything i pursue be pleased tell your friends the trial we're in is different [Music] brother dave wood took sister bessie to the hospital he wasn't allowed to go in that's a new kind of trial you've got a sick wife for five days she's in a room all by herself nobody could go in and comfort her even the staff doesn't want to be there spends as little time as possible goes in and gets out and they're all dressed up and suited up but dave even before he knew his wife was admitted he had to sit in the car in the parking lot of the er for five hours four or five hours to wait to see if his wife would be admitted and then when he found out she was admitted he had to turn his car around and drive home and go back to an empty house while his wife do you realize what god's doing he's proving who's in control and who's the strong one here he's getting us in positions where we're helpless and incapable and the strong ones can't help the weak ones because he's going to be the only strong one you know how many times i've known the people were sick in the assembly and my desire was to grab this anointing on there to run to their house and god said no told me no and i knew it would work because we believed the word but god in my heart told me no my wife even asked me can you go pray for them god told me no why he's going to be the strong one he's proving that he can get us alone by ourselves isolated nobody else to come and show up as the strong one he's going to be the strong one brother gene petrie is all by himself in a hospital i told my wife last night i would be willing to do quarantine if they would just let me sit in his room i would just sit in his room and talk to him and comfort him and be there with my brother that's the place i want to be i would quarantine for two weeks if i could just be with brother gene but god's the one who said no nobody else can go in that room he's there by himself what's god doing he's showing who's going to be the strong one and he's showing amen that his strength is made perfect in our weakness when we can't do for one another when we can't show up and be the strong one when god can take somebody who's weak and sick amen confused in their mind isolate them from their family isolate them from the church put them in a place that's surrounded by unbelief and he can show up mighty on their behalf and heal them and deliver them who gets credit for that only one [Music] amen god is doing exactly what he intends to do and he's proving who's god and he's proving who the husband and he's proving who the shepherd is he's proving who the pastor is he's proving who the minister is he's proving who can deliver it's been a hard time for all of us it's a hard time for families it's a hard time for ministry it's a hard time for me it's a hard time for you this has been a hard time but god is showing who he is and he's showing that he doesn't need our strength he doesn't need hey man he doesn't need us to provide a support system or a strong arm to lean on he can be the strong arm to lean on when all of their arms are taken away there's one that nobody can take away men they can limit access at a hospital but they can't stop god from coming in that room it may be able to to limit access in churches and limit how much we can have fellowship and how close we can come together but they can't stop god from being the strong arm that we lean on no government can ban him no hospital can put him out no disease can separate us from them amen god is showing us that through this trial we can lean on him and he's enough amen i mourn it i don't enjoy it i i have complained about it [Music] god forgive me but i have complained about it i have i i have bickered and i have been bitter and i've i've done all of those things that i've had to repent of but god has ordained this time for the bride and for this church in particular and he's showing us something that we would have never learned any other way and i believe we're going to come out of this with a greater confidence in him that we've ever had before in our lives and we're gonna know i mean there's nothing like facing something head-on the whole world's afraid of it and we've had to face it head-on and god shows that he can heal it doesn't matter if it's a new disease an old disease it doesn't matter if it has a weird name or an old name it doesn't matter if it's cancer tuberculosis it's been defeated before and if a new one pops up with a new name the same blood of jesus christ the same stripes on his back heals this one like he healed all others and god has made us face it and face it down to realize the blood of jesus christ amen the blood of jesus christ is more powerful than any device of the devil [Music] and we would have rather dodged it you know but god made us face it and find out that his healing power is the same that his power to deliver is the same and god is good friends if that's what he wanted that's what we wanted we would have never asked for it we would never set the circumstances up like they've been set up but if that's what he wants that's what we want and in our weakness may his strength be made perfect may he show himself mighty on our behalf not because we were mighty but because he was mighty we were needy he was mighty we were helpless he was our helper i thank god for that we've learned a lot and i think we'll learn more but our confidence should be increasing in our husband to take care of his little bride and let's just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing as we go dear heavenly father [Music] we thank you lord jesus we thank you god for your goodness and for your mercy to us lord you have proved yourself you've proved yourself mighty on our behalf you've proved yourself capable when we in our flesh were incapable lord you were capable your words never failed it's never diminished by one ought lord when we found out we were insufficient when we found out that we couldn't fight the system we couldn't stop lord the regulations lord we couldn't even stop lord sickness from entering our bodies god we found out you were more than able to deliver [Music] you're everything that we need lord we don't need a plan we need you we don't need our own strength we need you you are our strength you've proved yourself again and again god we're just trusting you to prove yourself mighty on behalf of our brother gene that you would do the same for him as you've done for others that you'd bring him out and you'd raise him up with a mighty hand and make him strong and healthy lord god for every one lord that still is in need of a touch in their body i pray that you strengthen each one of them well this isn't the path that we would have walked lord but we're thankful that you had a better plan than ours we're thankful that you don't ask our permission lord but you do what's best and we recognize and acknowledge that you're god and lord if you want us to stand still then we want to stand still if you want us to be quiet we want to be quiet if you want us to be weak then we want to be weak lord god you're just putting in us a desire to be whatever you want us to be god just reveal yourself to us give us your instructions and let us lord be sensitive to your leadership let us know the move of your holy ghost and that we won't listen to any ideas of man we won't listen to reasoning we won't listen to our own voices but we'll just listen to the still small voice that will be be sensitive to know your leadership and we'll follow
