[0:00] Jesus was God In the Flesh
[0:04] he was a king the prophet say he was the
[0:07] king of prophets
[0:09] you see I put cup in the blue so you can
[0:13] see it
[0:14] he is in Gethsemane
[0:18] and he sees a vision
[0:21] somewhere brother Branham say he was in
[0:25] a conference
[0:26] a spiritual conference with the father
[0:31] and the talking
[0:34] and he sees the cup and he knows as a
[0:38] Prophet this is a symbol what it means
[0:41] is if I accept
[0:45] then it will be I would take the cup of
[0:48] the sins of humanity
[0:51] he knows what that means and he's
[0:54] struggling is crying
[0:58] is screaming Hebrews tells us
[1:02] he's screaming father if it was possible
[1:05] Let It Go
[1:12] the vision of the cup is spiritual
[1:16] occurrence
[1:19] foreign
[1:26] before the physical happened
[1:29] at Calvary is that right
[1:34] get some money has to happen before
[1:37] Calvary
[1:39] if gethseman did not happen don't ask
[1:43] for Calvary
[1:45] so what do I which one is the most
[1:48] important
[1:52] he begged
[1:56] is screamed
[1:59] did he cry and beg and scream
[2:03] Calvary
[2:05] the Bible say he was silent there
[2:09] the most important
[2:11] things were happening in get the money
[2:16] this is where
[2:18] he had to die
[2:25] so if I talk this way to my fellow
[2:29] denominational
[2:31] you were saying Calvary was not
[2:33] important that Calvary was absolutely
[2:36] important
[2:38] but he had a prerequisite
[2:42] it could not happen without to get some
[2:45] money
