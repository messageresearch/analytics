[12:15] amen and it's good to be back here I was
[12:18] here uh if I'm not mistaken sometime in
[12:20] the middle of
[12:22] 2019 and I thank the Lord uh first and
[12:26] foremost for giving me and my wife again
[12:29] the opportunity to be here I think it
[12:30] was a midweek service when I was here
[12:32] last uh uh January of
[12:36] 2019 just before the pandemic and uh I
[12:39] never thought that we can travel again
[12:40] because of this Global thing but uh the
[12:43] Lord is gracious and we had uh brother
[12:45] Chad and Brother Kyle in the Philippines
[12:48] in the beginning of the year and we were
[12:49] blessed and to see them once again and
[12:52] we were talk Talking me and brother CH
[12:54] in uh because I was you I was in uh in
[12:58] Canada uh June and he invited me to be
[13:02] here but things did not work out I was
[13:04] with my daughters and they they didn't
[13:06] have the the the Visa going to the us so
[13:09] we have to cancel the trip and just make
[13:12] another trip to go here and uh I'm glad
[13:14] that things worked out and I had uh we
[13:17] had the opportunity to be with uh
[13:19] brother Chad again in his family in the
[13:21] church and I'm so thankful for the
[13:23] kindness the
[13:25] hospitality uh sister Angie and uh
[13:28] brother Chad they're always I I know
[13:30] that every visitor that they have they
[13:33] make make them special but I know that
[13:35] I'm also special for them and uh we also
[13:39] have this opportunity how to spend time
[13:41] with the family of bar Kyle s and it was
[13:43] also a special day and to last yesterday
[13:46] was also a special day because I I was
[13:49] able to spend time with the the young
[13:51] people during the de the devotion time
[13:54] and of course this is the most special
[13:56] day because it's our anniversary with my
[13:58] wife
[13:59] and you know and you know sometimes um
[14:01] every time I hear a testimony on about
[14:03] an uh couples having their anniversary
[14:06] they would say I thank the Lord for
[14:08] giving me a wonderful wife a perfect
[14:10] wife so sounds so ideal but I thank the
[14:14] Lord that God gave me not a perfect wife
[14:17] and I am not a perfect husband but we
[14:19] have a perfect God that put us together
[14:21] for the last 35 years of our life and
[14:24] the Bible said that we are given 70
[14:27] years and if by reason of strength we
[14:28] reach 80 so I've spent all already half
[14:32] of my lifetime with my wife and I don't
[14:34] regret it a bit I've learned so many
[14:36] things in fact when I was gathering my
[14:39] thoughts uh the inspiration that I got
[14:42] uh to share this morning is about uh the
[14:44] experiences experiences that I had with
[14:47] my wife I mean so many humbling
[14:50] experiences I thought I would control
[14:53] the family I thought I would teach him
[14:54] so many things but God has allowed so
[14:58] many humbling experiences in my life
[15:00] learning and learning and learning and
[15:03] maybe I'll keep on learning until we
[15:05] reach the age of 70 or 80 or whoever
[15:08] goes first amen but I'm thankful that
[15:10] the Lord has given me uh we we were
[15:13] blessed with four children uh we have
[15:16] already two grandkids and U uh we I just
[15:20] thank the Lord for all this the things
[15:22] that has God has given us for the first
[15:25] seven years of our married life we were
[15:27] not yet believers
[15:29] and I was baptized when during our uh in
[15:32] my in our seventh year of being husband
[15:33] and wife a few months later she got
[15:35] baptized and we had two more daughters
[15:39] uh I mean we had two sons when I we
[15:41] became Believers and we had two more
[15:43] daughters and they grew up in the
[15:44] message and looking back looking back I
[15:46] would say that our relationship my my
[15:49] relationship with my wife is not a
[15:51] perfect relationship we had our ups and
[15:54] downs and more Downs than ups but we we
[15:58] thank the Lord because it was through
[16:01] those experience that we had in our life
[16:03] that we learned to love each other more
[16:06] to compliment each other and we we
[16:08] realize that without God in our
[16:10] relationship we might have divorced or
[16:13] separated in our younger years but now
[16:16] we continue to be together and I think
[16:17] that is something that we should be
[16:19] thankful about 35 years not very long
[16:22] compared to the older couples that are
[16:24] here but it is not very short either
[16:26] compared to the younger couples that are
[16:28] here we are in the middle of the road
[16:30] and the prophet said we should stay in
[16:32] the middle of the road amen so that's
[16:34] message based amen so I'm just thankful
[16:37] and of course sister Isel being here
[16:39] with us one of our young people in our
[16:41] church before she went to the US and
[16:44] it's such a privilege to see her once
[16:46] again she was in the Philippines last
[16:48] year for a short vacation and my wife
[16:51] was communicating with her uh for the
[16:54] possibility for her to come here and I
[16:56] was glad that uh she was here meeting um
[17:00] she met brother Chad before in the
[17:02] Philippines and now she met the the
[17:04] family of brother Chad so uh I'm praying
[17:07] and hoping that uh one day she will
[17:08] decide to be here in the church to
[17:11] transfer here no so but I recommended
[17:13] her uh recommended to her that it would
[17:16] be a good thing to have a fellowship uh
[17:18] with with fellow Believers and
[17:19] especially with pastors that I know that
[17:21] has called but has been called by the
[17:24] Lord so I uh uh I really pray that uh
[17:28] things will work out for her and of
[17:30] course um I'm thankful uh seeing Brother
[17:33] Kyle again we have been I think the last
[17:35] time we were together was uh I mean in
[17:38] the mission field was in Cambodia in
[17:40] 2019 and I was telling him that at this
[17:43] end of the month I'll be going back
[17:44] there because they resumed their camp
[17:46] meeting and uh this church you may not
[17:48] know it and maybe I'll discuss it later
[17:50] this afternoon you have this church have
[17:52] helped a lot in the mission work in the
[17:55] not only in the Philippines but in Asia
[17:58] Southeast Asia these countries and uh we
[18:00] may not be able to report everything
[18:03] that this church has done uh through the
[18:06] not only through the financial help but
[18:08] also to the prayers and the support and
[18:10] the ministry but you will never know
[18:13] until eternity comes and we will be
[18:15] talking about it the things that we have
[18:17] done and maybe some of uh the people
[18:20] that were reached uh uh in those
[18:23] countries they will approach you when we
[18:25] are in heaven and they will thank you
[18:27] for the that you gave because of that
[18:31] they they knew the Lord they heard the
[18:33] message and now they are in the message
[18:35] amen so today uh I I just want to to
[18:40] give a little bit of encouragement to us
[18:43] and as I mentioned uh my topic for today
[18:46] is humbling experiences that God allows
[18:49] in our life sometimes we this is the
[18:53] experience that we don't want to have we
[18:56] always want to have good experiences the
[18:58] best best experiences of life but it's I
[19:00] I believe it is part of our character
[19:02] molding that God allows this kind of
[19:04] experiences and you may be uh Liv uh in
[19:08] the message for the last 50 years of
[19:09] your life or maybe for the Last 5 Years
[19:11] of your life but make no mistake all of
[19:14] us even the ministers we will have
[19:17] experiences in our life that will uh be
[19:20] directed to us so God can humble us
[19:24] because there's always a human tendency
[19:26] that when we accomplish something when
[19:29] we achieve something in our life we
[19:32] always tend to to be puffed up to think
[19:36] that we are better than the others and
[19:39] some will say oh I'm not like that I'm
[19:41] very humble then that means that you are
[19:43] not
[19:44] humble because you are arrogant right so
[19:49] let me read first the scriptures and if
[19:51] I can invite you once again before we
[19:52] continue uh I'd like to read three parts
[19:55] of the scriptures Book of Psalms chapter
[19:57] 18 we'll be reading from uh verse 31 and
[20:02] verse 32 Book of Psalms chapter 18 verse
[20:06] 31 and 32 he said here for who is God
[20:10] save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our
[20:14] God it is God that Garth me with
[20:17] strength and make my way perfect amen
[20:21] and in the in chapter 75 of the book of
[20:24] Psalms chapter
[20:26] 75: 5 to
[20:31] 7 it says here lift not up your horn on
[20:35] high in other words don't be arrogant
[20:38] speak not with a stiff neck for
[20:41] promotion comes neither from the East
[20:43] nor from the West nor from the South but
[20:47] God is the judge he puts down one and
[20:50] set up another so it's the Sovereign
[20:53] will of God right and the third uh
[20:57] scripture I would like to read in 2
[20:59] Corinthians
[21:00] chapter uh 3 2 Corinthians chapter 3
[21:05] we'll be reading two verses verse 5 and
[21:07] verse
[21:08] 6 Paul was writing to the Corinthians
[21:11] and said not that we are sufficient of
[21:14] ourselves to think
[21:16] anything as of ourselves but our
[21:19] sufficiency is of
[21:21] God who also had made us able Ministers
[21:24] of the New Testament not of the letter
[21:27] but of the spirit for the letter kills
[21:29] but the spirit gives life amen so all
[21:33] these words amen that we have read from
[21:36] the book of Psalms to the book of 2
[21:38] Corinthians it's basically teaching us
[21:41] to be humble it's basically teaching us
[21:44] that our sufficiency is not in ourselves
[21:47] not in our capabilities or our intellect
[21:50] it is everything is from the Lord amen
[21:54] now let me read to you a a portion of
[21:57] the the message message this is the
[21:59] title of the message was washing jesus'
[22:01] feet he said when a man thinks that is
[22:05] just a little bit better than somebody
[22:07] else you're on the road out my brother
[22:10] that is what is saying we are all the
[22:13] same in the sight of God rich or poor
[22:15] brown or black white or yellow whatever
[22:19] we may be we are all one on on on one
[22:23] equal basis with God there's no racial
[22:26] discrimination or differences the sight
[22:28] of God anyway after all we all came from
[22:31] the lineage of Noah right after the
[22:35] flood okay but people have the tendency
[22:38] to to separate themselves from one
[22:40] another people have the tendency to
[22:43] categorize uh uh their their their way
[22:46] of living and of course we we have
[22:49] different cultures we came from
[22:50] different countries and sometimes I can
[22:53] even see that in message churches that
[22:55] if you go to certain I'm not referring
[22:57] to this this church but sometimes I had
[22:59] the experience of go getting to message
[23:01] churches and and you can sense the the
[23:05] spirit of
[23:07] superiority see and these are message
[23:10] Believers waiting for the Rapture like
[23:12] you and me but I said they need to be
[23:15] born again they have to realize that in
[23:18] in God's
[23:19] sight we are all on equal basis am and
[23:23] in the in the church age book God the
[23:26] prophet said God's will for us is
[23:27] perfect Perfection and that Perfection
[23:30] is patience waiting on God Waiting for
[23:33] God Amen and this is the process of
[23:36] character development so when God allows
[23:39] humbling experience in our life this is
[23:42] for our own character development and
[23:45] sometimes people learn the easy way
[23:47] sometimes people learn the hard way some
[23:50] people doesn't learn at all see these
[23:53] are three kinds of people see but e i I
[23:56] would either learn the EAS way than the
[23:58] hard way but God will allow things to
[24:00] happen in our life to shake us from what
[24:03] we think we are to shake us from what we
[24:06] think we know and start yielding oursel
[24:09] to God one time I I I preached the
[24:11] message in our church Divine assignment
[24:15] we have a a Divine assignment from the
[24:17] Lord and what is a Divine assignment i i
[24:19] i defined it in my own terms I said a
[24:21] Divine assignment is doing what God
[24:23] wants you to do going where God wants
[24:25] you to go and being what God's want you
[24:27] to be it's not about yourself it's about
[24:31] God and his plan for our life see so
[24:35] humbling experience and and when when we
[24:37] Define humbling experience these are
[24:40] unusual events or situation or condition
[24:43] that God allows in our life to to to
[24:46] disrupt the normal routine that we have
[24:50] because normally if you you you keep on
[24:53] doing things every day you live a
[24:55] regimented life do it becomes your
[24:57] comfort zone and the next step you
[25:00] become
[25:01] self-sufficient overconfident and then
[25:04] you become arrogant and then you tend to
[25:06] look down at people that cannot do what
[25:08] you're doing cannot say what you're
[25:10] saying cannot think what you're thinking
[25:12] and you feel Superior over them and so
[25:15] God will allow circumstances in our life
[25:18] to to Humble us no matter what age you
[25:21] are whether you're in school uh a young
[25:24] professional or even the older people
[25:28] the humbling experience that not does
[25:30] not stop in a certain stage of our life
[25:32] it goes on and on and on and I I cannot
[25:35] even count the many humbling experience
[25:38] that God allowed to happen in my life
[25:41] before I became a minister during the
[25:44] time that I'm a minister even in the
[25:45] present and I am looking forward to more
[25:48] humbling experience because there's so
[25:50] much of us so much in US I mean that
[25:54] that God has to strip
[25:56] away until we learn learn to yield
[25:58] ourselves to the Lord and we we and then
[26:01] we can understand that it is not because
[26:04] of us but because of the go of the god
[26:07] that is living in us now I you know you
[26:10] know I love to hear testimonies of
[26:12] people uh um s how they came to know the
[26:18] Lord not only for message Believers but
[26:20] even for denominational Christians and
[26:24] one time I I came across a testimony of
[26:27] the
[26:28] former heavyweight champion of the world
[26:30] because I love boxing I was a amateur
[26:32] boxer when I was young and this this
[26:35] former heavyweight champion of the world
[26:37] his name was George foran he was the
[26:39] Olympic champion for representing the
[26:42] United States uh in 1968 and in
[26:46] 1973 he was able to to get the
[26:50] championship from his smoking Joe Fraser
[26:53] amen so he was he was 64 in height
[26:58] weighing 250 lb and he pack a knockout
[27:01] punch and he always say he wants to
[27:04] finish his opponent in the first two
[27:06] rounds he doesn't want uh to have a long
[27:10] period because he gets tired easily so
[27:13] he was he he was so gifted in in in
[27:17] punching people right I don't know if
[27:20] that's even a gift but uh that was his
[27:23] gift he said that he was that he was
[27:24] good at that and so uh after being a
[27:28] champion in 1973 he he defended this
[27:32] title for two times and the third time
[27:36] that he will defend this uh uh his title
[27:39] was in
[27:40] 1974 and he fought muhamad
[27:44] Ali I don't know if you you know these
[27:46] people but I know them very well because
[27:48] I always watched their games before and
[27:51] in
[27:52] 1974 in in in in in Africa they fought
[27:56] and George Foreman was very confident
[27:59] that he will beat uh Muhammad Ali who
[28:02] was older who was smaller who was
[28:04] lighter than him he was so full of
[28:06] confidence but here is Muhammad Ali had
[28:09] made a strategy to beat George Foreman
[28:12] then after that after that
[28:15] fight we know that he lost the fight he
[28:18] lost the title and it was uh he was
[28:22] young and he was he was uh I mean uh
[28:26] when he lost the fight he got depressed
[28:29] he it went on a little bit and in 1977
[28:32] he fought his last fight losing to a uh
[28:36] nobody in the boxing world it was not
[28:39] even
[28:40] known I even forgot his
[28:43] name and so during after the fight he
[28:46] went to the to the locker room and
[28:49] according to his testimony he he got a
[28:51] Epiphany a religious Epiphany in other
[28:54] words he he there was an experience that
[28:57] the the the Holy Spirit to took a hold
[28:59] of him and he got born again from a
[29:02] boxer now he became a Believer amen and
[29:07] the next years that happened in the next
[29:09] few years uh he was attending a church
[29:13] and he became eventually he became a
[29:15] preacher from a boxer to a preacher all
[29:18] right and if your pastor is a is a
[29:20] former
[29:21] boxer and you know people will just obey
[29:24] the pastor right okay so so here is
[29:27] George foran now then he he said it it
[29:32] took a humbling experience for him to
[29:36] know the Lord without because he was so
[29:38] full of Pride he was popular he had this
[29:43] reputation of being a good boxer and God
[29:46] has to strip everything away amen it
[29:50] took a humbling experience for him and
[29:53] so when he did that when that thing
[29:55] happened to him he starts serving the
[29:57] lord he became a preacher and many years
[30:00] later he'd go back to the ring and and
[30:03] fight and God uh uh allowed him I don't
[30:07] know what uh if that is good or not but
[30:10] I mean he allowed him to be Champion
[30:12] again at the age of 45 and there was a
[30:16] part of his testimony he said when he
[30:18] was young he will he will fight and try
[30:20] to finish the game for the first two
[30:23] rounds but when he got older in This
[30:25] heavyweight championship that was that
[30:28] happened in 1994 he said he was he had a
[30:31] lot of
[30:32] patience he was waiting and waiting and
[30:35] waiting he was he was telling this in a
[30:37] testimony in one of the churches and he
[30:39] was waiting and waiting and waiting not
[30:42] unlike when he was
[30:43] younger that he was he always he was so
[30:46] aggressive but this time he's waiting
[30:48] and waiting waiting for the right time
[30:50] and then when he he saw the right time
[30:52] and bum and a knockout he became the
[30:56] oldest heavyweight champion of the world
[30:58] at the age of 45 now I while I was
[31:00] looking at it you we can apply that in
[31:03] our spiritual life When We Were Young we
[31:05] are so aggressive we think that we can
[31:07] do so many things according to our
[31:09] abilities according to our intellect
[31:11] according to what we want but when we
[31:13] get older in serving the lord we learn
[31:16] to wait we we learn to wait on God we
[31:19] learn to wait for God there's a timing
[31:23] and we realize that it's not our
[31:26] sufficiency God is our sufficiency the
[31:29] only way that that we can we can we can
[31:32] accomplish anything even in I'm a
[31:35] minister for for 25 years uh when I was
[31:39] young I thought that I could I've been
[31:42] accomplishing things for the Lord but
[31:45] then I realized that as I got older
[31:47] without the grace of God without his
[31:50] leading without his anointing without
[31:53] his
[31:55] inspiration no nobody can be blessed in
[31:58] the ministry that the Lord has entrusted
[31:59] me and every time I think that the
[32:02] people are blessed in the word that I
[32:04] preach they are not blessed but every
[32:07] time that I feel that I did not do my
[32:11] job well somebody will approach you and
[32:13] they will say that they were blessed and
[32:15] you know that you know that it was not
[32:18] you because you know in yourself that
[32:21] you you're not even sure of what you
[32:24] preaching and so this this this testimon
[32:27] this humbling experience that the Lord
[32:29] gives us it is part of our learning in
[32:33] life amen the the and this learning will
[32:37] will give us a much I mean uh much um
[32:42] perspective in in the life that we are
[32:45] living and some of the uh humbling
[32:47] experience that we have sometimes it
[32:50] it's like a in a secular job you think
[32:53] that you're uh doing well and you know
[32:56] that you have an expert
[32:57] and somebody gets promoted ahead of you
[33:00] that is a humbling experience see if you
[33:03] lose your job you lose a property uh or
[33:07] maybe you lose your influence to others
[33:09] that is a humbling experience we have a
[33:12] uh a brother in our church when we
[33:14] started we started in our church 1995 we
[33:17] were employees of the hotel different
[33:19] departments we were all together we were
[33:21] serving the lord and after 5 years this
[33:24] brother he just wanted to stop serving
[33:26] the lord
[33:27] and he he was not um going to the
[33:30] direction that he will do evil things
[33:32] but he just wanted to focus in his
[33:34] career and he did that for the next 20
[33:38] years of his life from from year 2000 to
[33:41] year 2020 but in those years he was very
[33:44] successful he was able to travel the
[33:46] whole world he was he got promoted he
[33:49] became uh he he he was able to get this
[33:52] High position in the companies that he
[33:54] was working for but in
[33:57] 2018 he had a kidney failure because of
[34:00] sugar diabetes and he started having
[34:03] this uh what they call this the
[34:05] dialysis and it was the time that uh he
[34:09] remembered that he left the Lord and so
[34:12] two years later in 2020 during the
[34:15] pandemic he was contacting one of our
[34:17] brothers in church and he said he wanted
[34:19] to go back to
[34:20] church because everything is on a
[34:23] lockdown he was asking if we still have
[34:25] church and
[34:27] so uh he started he started attending
[34:30] the church and his prayer was not to get
[34:33] healed although he believed that he can
[34:35] get healed but his prayer was he wanted
[34:39] uh his relationship with God to be
[34:41] restored and I think that's a good
[34:43] prayer amen and he he he called me he
[34:46] said pastor I'm not here uh uh to ask
[34:49] prayers from you that I will be healed I
[34:50] want to restore my relationship with the
[34:52] Lord and his his body was slowly
[34:55] deteriorating uh uh
[34:57] in 2021 he got his feet got amputated in
[35:01] 2022 one eye is blind after a few months
[35:05] one ear is cannot hear anymore and the
[35:08] veins where they put the needle is not
[35:10] is not functioning anymore so slowly and
[35:13] slowly his body is deteriorating all the
[35:15] internal organs are being affected and
[35:17] in in July 2023 this year he called me
[35:21] up one Friday he said I have decided
[35:23] Pastor to stop my dialysis and I I am
[35:26] not a medical practitioner but I know
[35:27] that if you stop dialysis uh it will
[35:31] take 3 days more or more a little bit
[35:34] more and then you get you have this
[35:37] sepsis or blood poisoning and then you
[35:39] die and I said are you sure that you are
[35:41] doing that and said I'm so tired and the
[35:45] reason I'm not committing suicide is
[35:47] said I'm now ready I have I I have uh my
[35:52] relationship with the Lord was
[35:54] restored and I just wanted to go home to
[35:57] the Lord he was so tired physically but
[36:00] he was so happy uh that uh his
[36:04] relationship with the Lord and after all
[36:06] this humbling experience that he had he
[36:10] just wanted to go home to the Lord and
[36:11] so uh we spent a few more days and he
[36:15] died but he died happy he died he was
[36:18] ready and I was contemplating back on
[36:21] the conversation that we had in the last
[36:24] week of his life he said how how he
[36:27] needed those humbling experience in life
[36:30] that if not for those experiences he he
[36:33] he would not have gone back to the Lord
[36:35] he was just the same age as mine 58 so
[36:38] he not very old he's not very young but
[36:40] I mean he has lots of things to do if he
[36:44] still he was still alive but but he
[36:45] reached to a a point in his life that
[36:48] After experiencing all these things in
[36:50] his life he realized how important the
[36:53] most important thing is not uh the money
[36:56] that he made the position that he
[36:57] handled the the the property that he
[37:00] acquired but what is more important is
[37:03] the restoration of his relationship with
[37:05] the Lord and I think it is a lesson for
[37:08] me and a lesson for many people that uh
[37:11] we have to
[37:12] rearrange our priorities in life
[37:15] sometimes you will think that you are a
[37:17] father that you are in control of your
[37:19] family and one day you will have an
[37:22] argument that may cause uh a divorce
[37:26] from your wife or maybe a children she
[37:29] children that rebel against you I me as
[37:32] a pastor I have I have so
[37:35] many uh humbling experiences that
[37:38] sometimes in my young AG I will preach
[37:41] in a way that for me I'm not condemning
[37:44] the people but because uh everything is
[37:49] good in our family everything is good in
[37:51] my in my
[37:52] Ministry I I I'm projecting something
[37:55] that condemns the people people not
[37:57] convicting them and then God will allow
[38:00] experiences in my life my life to Humble
[38:05] me and I started apologizing in the
[38:08] Pulpit they didn't know what I did but
[38:11] uh uh I would not say secretly but in my
[38:14] heart I know there's some arrogance in
[38:16] the way I
[38:18] preach but as I get older and older and
[38:21] older I realize that I I have nothing to
[38:24] brag about everything that can preach
[38:27] it's because by the grace of God you can
[38:30] be a fiery preacher jump up and down
[38:33] shout here shout there it has no effect
[38:35] on the people see but you can speak
[38:38] slowly and in a small a low tone voice
[38:43] but if it's coming from a sincere heart
[38:45] it affects the people it transforms the
[38:48] lives of the people so it's not about
[38:51] how articulate you are how knowled
[38:54] knowledgeable you are in the message
[38:56] it's always about your life it's always
[38:59] about your life the way you project it
[39:02] the way you you speak the way you think
[39:05] uh it will you will catch the spirit you
[39:10] don't know me you don't know my
[39:12] background in the Philippines but I
[39:14] cannot hide the spirit that is in me you
[39:19] you are you are message Believers you
[39:20] will discern it and you catch it and
[39:22] sometimes you may say there's something
[39:24] off in this person he he speaks well
[39:28] he's good he looks good but something's
[39:31] not right you know why because there's a
[39:33] spirit hiding see and we are believer we
[39:36] are given the the spirit of discernment
[39:39] Amen to to to to to discern the spirits
[39:43] amen so now let's let's let's move on a
[39:46] little bit and we will just look at some
[39:48] of the scriptures where God gave
[39:52] uh humbling experience to the characters
[39:55] of The Bible we start with in the books
[39:57] in the book of Acts chapter 9 it says
[40:00] here this is the conversion of Saul and
[40:03] it said and soul yet breathing out
[40:07] threatenings chapter 9 verse 1 of a book
[40:11] of Acts he said and desired of him
[40:13] letters to Damascus to the synagogues
[40:16] that if he found any of this way whether
[40:19] they were men or women he might bring
[40:21] them bound unto Jerusalem as he and as
[40:23] he journeyed he came near Damascus and
[40:26] there suddenly there shined round about
[40:28] him a light from Heaven he fell to the
[40:30] Earth God knows how to put you down
[40:33] right he fell to the Earth and heard a
[40:35] voice saying soul soul why persecutest
[40:39] thou me and he said who art thou Lord
[40:41] and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou
[40:43] persecute persecutest it is hard for
[40:46] thee to kick against the the priests now
[40:49] this was uh the reaction of Soul he said
[40:52] and he trembling and astonished said
[40:56] Lord Lord what will thou have me to do I
[41:00] think that's the best response if God
[41:03] gives us a humbling experience our our
[41:06] reaction should be Lord what do you want
[41:08] me to do Lord why is this happening to
[41:11] me not in the form that you're
[41:13] questioning the sovereignty of God but
[41:16] you want to know why this happened to us
[41:19] and sometimes it's almost uh a question
[41:22] the prophet preached about a whole
[41:24] message and the title is why
[41:27] see all of us are always asking the
[41:29] question why why does this has to happen
[41:31] to me I'm not doing anything bad I'm
[41:34] doing I'm serving the lord I've been in
[41:36] the message for many years and all of a
[41:38] sudden these things seemingly negative
[41:41] will happen to us and we ask the Lord
[41:44] why and I think it is just normal to ask
[41:49] why but we have to realize that God is a
[41:52] sovereign God and he knows what he
[41:54] wanted to do in our life to develop our
[41:57] character in the message uh I think is
[41:59] the message is uh the title is message
[42:02] respects he said God God's uh
[42:06] um let me find the C he said we cannot
[42:10] question God we just have to respect
[42:13] because we he knows what he's doing for
[42:15] us and what he is doing for us is always
[42:17] the best for us and we may not may may
[42:20] not understand it for the in our whole
[42:23] lifetime and as I always say to our
[42:25] church God is not obligated to explain
[42:27] to us everything that is happening to us
[42:30] we just have to learn to trust him to
[42:32] believe in him that he's in full control
[42:35] but sometimes it's easier said than done
[42:38] when you're in that kind of situation
[42:40] there's always a tendency to ask God to
[42:42] be depressed to to to have a wounded
[42:47] Spirit but see God knows what's best for
[42:50] us he's just giving us these experiences
[42:53] so we may learn amen that we are not
[42:56] sufficient in our s and so we we we know
[43:00] that this happened to Paul uh to Saul
[43:04] and they became po right and now he was
[43:08] able it didn't stop there even in the in
[43:11] in the in his ministry you would think
[43:14] that after God has humbled him called
[43:17] him used him that all will be well in
[43:20] his life but that's that was not the
[43:24] case see and in in the book of 2
[43:27] Corinthians chapter 12 which is a
[43:30] familiar verse to all of us brother
[43:32] Brandon preached a whole message about
[43:34] this perfect strength and perfect
[43:35] witness he said in verse 7 first Corin 2
[43:40] Corinthians 12:7 he said lest I should
[43:43] be exalted above measure through the
[43:46] abundance of the revelations there was
[43:48] given to me a torn In the
[43:50] Flesh the messenger of Satan to BU me
[43:53] lest I should be exalted above me ass
[43:56] sure for this thing I besought the Lord
[43:59] Christ he doesn't want this turn in the
[44:01] flesh we do not want a turn in the flesh
[44:04] nobody is praying Lord give me a turn in
[44:06] the
[44:07] flesh you cannot read in a prayer
[44:09] request that there's a brother or a
[44:10] sister requesting for a torn In the
[44:13] Flesh see we all all always we want to
[44:17] that God will
[44:18] remove the torn In the Flesh and even
[44:22] Paul himself he he besought the Lord
[44:24] Christ that it might depart part from
[44:26] him and he said unto me my grace is
[44:29] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[44:31] made perfect in weakness and you see as
[44:35] long as we are weak in ourselves the
[44:37] Lord is strong in ourselves amen we we
[44:40] cannot get away from that God will
[44:43] always give us this weakness this
[44:47] vulnerability so we'll always depend on
[44:49] God we know the life of Moses he was
[44:52] trained for 40 years the prophet said it
[44:54] took 40 years to drill that education to
[44:57] Moses and took another 40 years to drill
[44:59] that out from Moses and I was I was
[45:03] asking why would the Lord allow
[45:05] education for Moses Egyptian education
[45:08] for 40 years and after 40 years he will
[45:10] spend another 40 years just to strip
[45:12] that away he could get
[45:14] directly to the next 40 Years of his
[45:16] life but God was doing something he was
[45:19] teaching Moses not to rely on man's
[45:22] knowledge you see there's a vast
[45:24] difference between knowledge and wisdom
[45:26] knowledge you can learn it from the
[45:27] school you can you can learn it from
[45:29] somebody training you and teaching you
[45:31] but wisdom you only get wisdom through
[45:34] experience through
[45:37] experience without the experience you
[45:39] will have all the knowledge in the world
[45:41] but wisdom you have to have experience
[45:44] you have to
[45:45] age so sometimes I'm telling my young
[45:48] people you think you know best because
[45:50] you have technology and everything right
[45:53] and that is true because the prophet
[45:55] said said this the next generation will
[45:57] become wiser but they will become weaker
[46:01] right that is the rec C of the Prophet
[46:03] they become wise they become they they
[46:06] have this technology but they're
[46:08] weaker H in physical because everything
[46:11] is automated right in our uh in in the
[46:15] days of the olden times Everything's
[46:17] manual there's no Comfort see those in
[46:21] my age bracket would know that those who
[46:23] are older than me would know better see
[46:26] but it but it it it it gives you
[46:30] something in your
[46:32] character if you are training to be to
[46:36] uh if you're under training let's say in
[46:37] a military training they give you all
[46:40] this this physical uh training and
[46:42] everything so when you are in
[46:45] battle your body can cope can adopt with
[46:50] with the things with the with the with
[46:53] the negative things that could happen in
[46:55] a b Battlefield and sometimes if we are
[46:57] too comfortable God will give us this
[46:59] humbling experience so that we may know
[47:03] that God is God and he's sufficient and
[47:05] we are not and so here's Moses first 40
[47:08] years second 40 years everything was
[47:10] stripped and after 40 years uh I mean at
[47:12] the age of 80 God said I can now use
[47:15] you before God cannot use him all of his
[47:18] abilities God cannot use him and and I
[47:23] like this this quote he said in the
[47:24] message perfect strength
[47:26] by Perfect witness he said there's one
[47:28] thing that we've got to master if we
[47:30] expect to fulfill God's desire not our
[47:32] desire but God's desire in our life that
[47:34] is we have to master the thought of
[47:37] human ability if you ever get to a spot
[47:41] where we think that we can do it with
[47:43] our own intelligence and our own
[47:44] abilities we got to master that in such
[47:47] a way that we can get rid of that thing
[47:49] and lay it aside that God can use us we
[47:52] all always say in our in our prayers in
[47:55] our uh when we testify we want God to
[47:58] use us but unless we Master the thought
[48:01] of human ability God can never use us
[48:03] God does not use us because of our
[48:05] ability God does not use us because of
[48:07] our intelligence he may use it uh but he
[48:10] has to give us a humbling experience now
[48:14] so uh we will not be
[48:16] relying relying on our own thoughts when
[48:19] I was a young preacher I I had I had so
[48:23] many there's no tablet yet before for
[48:26] and I have so many notes and before I
[48:29] preach I lost my my my notes so I don't
[48:32] know how what will I preach but what
[48:35] that is that is one of the best
[48:37] preaching that I had without notes
[48:40] because it was not me preaching it was
[48:43] God preaching to the people see but
[48:45] sometimes if you you come to the pull
[48:47] pit so
[48:49] prepared so many codes and so many
[48:52] scriptures and so many This and like
[48:54] that and then you realize that you get
[48:58] confused sometime you don't know what to
[49:01] say that's why I I I when I when when I
[49:04] teach our younger brothers in church
[49:06] hoping that they will be preachers
[49:07] someday I always tell them when you
[49:10] preach do
[49:11] not
[49:13] intend to to impress the people you do
[49:17] not preach to
[49:18] impress you preach so that they will be
[49:21] blessed and I said never ever preach the
[49:23] people to entertain them
[49:26] because some preachers can be preaching
[49:28] a good message but their motive and
[49:30] objective is just to impress the people
[49:33] that they know more than the people and
[49:36] sometimes they put a lot of you know
[49:38] entertainment but the prophet said the
[49:41] pulpit is not a place for entertainment
[49:43] you do not clown around right it is a
[49:46] serious thing because this is the
[49:48] nearest place Between Heaven and Earth
[49:50] and the angel in the Pulpit as we were
[49:53] talking with brother Chad is this is
[49:55] something uh it is a this is a message
[49:58] for you directly from God and and the
[50:01] prophet said we have to make a complete
[50:02] surrender we cannot use one ability we
[50:05] got to make a complete surrender soul
[50:07] body and spirit you know and sometimes
[50:10] it's easy to say that we will surrender
[50:12] but it takes almost a lifetime to fully
[50:16] surrender ourselves I can I can be
[50:18] honest to you this morning that I have
[50:20] not fully surrendered all aspects of my
[50:24] life and I believe
[50:26] I believe that it will take a lifetime
[50:28] for you for to you for you to totally
[50:30] surrender everything every faculties of
[50:33] your mind your heart your body and the
[50:37] only time that you can fully surrender
[50:39] is the day you
[50:41] die because you cannot do anything
[50:43] anymore see but until we are living
[50:46] there's this uh sticky nature brother
[50:49] calls it a carnal nature that is in you
[50:52] and if you read Romans chapter 6 chapter
[50:54] 7 there's something in us that wants to
[50:58] do bad things the evil things and this
[51:01] is the flesh not your inner man not your
[51:05] not your the the spirit of God that is
[51:07] in you but this
[51:09] flesh that's why we do not hug Brothers
[51:11] we do not hug sisters right because the
[51:15] pro the prophet said if we are healthy
[51:18] there's always a sensation that will
[51:20] happen no matter how old or young you
[51:22] are see so we have to be very very
[51:25] careful on these things now let me bring
[51:29] you to 1st Chronicle chap
[51:32] 26 uh this is the story of a king that
[51:35] God has blessed and and brother vam
[51:38] referred to him in he was preaching the
[51:41] message influence 2 Chronicles chapter
[51:46] 26 this is King Uzziah let me read to
[51:50] you the first verse until the 5ifth
[51:53] verse this is how we start started
[51:55] sometimes a Believer would would start
[51:58] right in his walk with God but will end
[52:01] up
[52:02] wrong he said then all the people of
[52:05] Judah took Uzziah who was 16 years old
[52:08] and made him
[52:09] King in the room of his father Amah he
[52:13] built eloth and restored it to Judah
[52:15] after that the King slept with his
[52:17] fathers 16 years old was Uzziah when he
[52:21] began to rain see he was just a teenager
[52:25] a young people and he reigned 52 years
[52:28] in Jerusalem his mother's name also was
[52:31] jaia of Jerusalem and he did that which
[52:34] was right in the sight of the Lord what
[52:36] a good start he was always doing good in
[52:39] the sight of the Lord according to all
[52:42] that his father Amah did and he sought
[52:45] God this is the second thing that made
[52:47] him great first he was doing the right
[52:50] things in the sight of God second he was
[52:52] always seeking God in the days of
[52:54] Zechariah the prophet who had
[52:57] understanding in the visions of God and
[52:59] as long as he sought the Lord God made
[53:02] him to prosper so there's the secret of
[53:05] prosperity seek the Lord do things right
[53:08] in the sight of God but you know when
[53:11] people start when God starts blessing
[53:14] people or blessing a church or or
[53:17] blessing a uh a career of a certain
[53:20] person human tendency not only for
[53:23] unbelievers for also but also of our
[53:25] Believers there we tend to forget the
[53:28] source of our
[53:31] blessings it's it's true in the
[53:33] Philippines it's true in the United
[53:35] States it's true in Pakistan it's true
[53:37] in every part of the world see I I I
[53:41] have members in our church that they
[53:43] will say l uh Pastor pray for me that
[53:45] the Lord will bless my career and I will
[53:47] pray for them and after you pray for
[53:50] them he said they they will they will
[53:51] leave the
[53:54] church
[53:55] and there was a there there was a a
[53:58] member in our church before he
[54:00] said I mean he he God the Lord prospered
[54:04] him and he was saying I will not
[54:06] give any money that I earned to the
[54:09] church but when he has no money was
[54:12] asking me to pray for him but when I
[54:14] prayed for him God bless him he thought
[54:17] I was asking for the money see that is
[54:20] how the Satan can easily get into your
[54:23] mind that you think you achieve this
[54:26] thing because you're good you're great
[54:30] right but it's not the case and so
[54:32] Uzziah he was successful in war he was
[54:34] successful in his Works he became famous
[54:37] he had architecture he had military
[54:39] might and all these things and he had so
[54:41] many people so many weapons in his
[54:44] Armory and then in verse 16 he said but
[54:47] when he was strong his heart was lifted
[54:49] up to his
[54:51] destruction and when your heart is lift
[54:53] lifted up you tell to do things beyond
[54:56] your
[54:57] calling and this is what Uzziah
[55:01] did he it it took the place of the
[55:04] priest you know the story amen he burned
[55:08] incense which was not supposed to be
[55:09] done by a king and here's the thing when
[55:13] he did that azarah the priest verse 17
[55:16] went in after him and with four score
[55:19] priests and the Lord that were Valiant
[55:21] men and they with stod
[55:24] Uzziah he was trying to correct the king
[55:27] because they know as priests in the
[55:31] temple of God the king cannot do that
[55:34] but instead of uh Uzziah uh heeding to
[55:39] the
[55:40] correction what he did was he got
[55:44] angry he got angry he doesn't want to be
[55:47] corrected you know when you when we come
[55:49] to a certain point that we don't want to
[55:51] be corrected we want don't want to be uh
[55:55] we we we fail to become teachable then
[55:57] that's the start of our
[55:59] end because we are we should be ever
[56:02] learning somebody has to correct us
[56:03] somebody's we need to be accountable to
[56:06] somebody so you can see a lot of
[56:08] Believers in the whole world that they
[56:10] can they want to to to to attend
[56:13] churches they want to stream different
[56:15] but they don't want to sit down in a
[56:17] church to be under a pastor because they
[56:20] don't want to be corrected right and
[56:23] once they are corrected they start
[56:25] leaving the church look for another
[56:27] church and when they start being
[56:30] corrected in the church that they
[56:32] transfer to they look for another church
[56:34] as the prophet said they travel from
[56:36] Pillar To Post and the the latter part
[56:38] of their spiritual life they would think
[56:41] that they are the only ones who are
[56:43] saved it's always that it's it has been
[56:47] always that way because they don't want
[56:49] to be corrected and most of the time I'm
[56:54] most of this my my experience most of
[56:55] the time those people who were blessed
[56:57] financially materially physically they
[57:00] are the ones that don't want to be
[57:03] corrected that's my experience I'm not
[57:05] again I'm not referring to you uh I I
[57:08] hope that if we are blessed we can still
[57:11] stand correction we can still accept
[57:13] correction because the pastor in the
[57:16] Pulpit is Anointed by God to correct the
[57:21] things not because he's perfect not
[57:24] because he's perfect but he was ordained
[57:26] to do so amen whether you are older or
[57:29] younger or the same age as your pastor
[57:31] it is the responsibility of the pastor
[57:34] and now the question on the floor arise
[57:36] who corrects the pastor God corrects the
[57:40] pastor you do not correct your pastor it
[57:42] will be the other way it is a wrong
[57:44] process every time I make a mistake God
[57:47] gives me a humbling experience and you
[57:50] will not be you will not want to be in
[57:52] my place because any humbling experience
[57:55] that the Lord gives you the past is so
[57:58] painful am it's so painful that's my
[58:01] experience it's so painful you you
[58:03] cannot you cannot have that arrogant
[58:06] spirit and it is a lesson in life that
[58:09] uh God will correct the
[58:12] ministers because we were ordained to
[58:15] correct the people so God will correct
[58:18] us and if he if he will not handle it
[58:21] quite well then ministers can also be
[58:24] arrogant
[58:25] see and that's the end of the ministry
[58:27] of any person and so here we see Uzziah
[58:31] the king he died with Leprosy which is a
[58:34] type of sin he never stopped and or
[58:38] humbled himself with what happened
[58:41] instead he thought he was still the king
[58:43] he can do what he wants to do and you
[58:46] know some people are like that they
[58:48] think that they can do what they want to
[58:49] do without anybody correcting them so we
[58:53] always need a headship amen if you are
[58:56] single you have the headship of your
[58:57] father if you are believers you have the
[58:59] headship of our pastor the ministers
[59:01] they have the W headship of Christ right
[59:05] it's all it always boil boils down to
[59:07] headship yes sir but if you fail to see
[59:10] that we need the headship who can
[59:12] correct
[59:14] us I my my pastor he he has been here
[59:17] and think in July brother neor he was my
[59:19] pastor when I was 13 Even though I a
[59:22] pastor he's a pastor ahead of me I
[59:24] always still submit myself to him just
[59:27] to make sure that I'm accountable to
[59:29] somebody else that somebody can correct
[59:31] me any time anywhere if he sees that I'm
[59:35] doing something wrong or I or if I'm
[59:38] going in a different direction he has
[59:40] the authority to do it to me and I will
[59:42] not be offended because I need that I
[59:45] need that and sometimes you cannot even
[59:48] see eye to eye on the things or or
[59:50] matters but it really doesn't affect me
[59:53] because I believe believe that is the
[59:55] authority that the Lord has given me see
[59:58] so it takes a humble heart to accept
[1:00:00] that there's somebody for you and and I
[1:00:02] I Marvel in the people that when I ask
[1:00:04] them who shared to you the message it
[1:00:06] was God who shared to me the message no
[1:00:10] person one day he was just sleeping he
[1:00:13] woke up he saw the
[1:00:15] message that is that is a
[1:00:19] lie that's not
[1:00:21] true see or or somebody will say I was
[1:00:24] just sitting somewhere I I saw a spoken
[1:00:26] word booklet I read it and then lo and
[1:00:30] behold I became a Believer see but
[1:00:33] that's not true God has to use somebody
[1:00:36] God has to use a man to put that spoken
[1:00:38] word in that place God has to give some
[1:00:41] tapes or some uh uh preaching of the
[1:00:44] Prophet so still God uses a man but
[1:00:47] sometimes people are so arrogant that
[1:00:49] they don't want to give credit to any
[1:00:51] people that God
[1:00:52] used for them to hear the message I feel
[1:00:56] I believe that is that is something that
[1:00:58] we should be taken away from us used to
[1:01:00] always uh look to somebody not to look
[1:01:02] up to somebody but to acknowledge that
[1:01:05] the that that God who wants to call us
[1:01:08] can use people around
[1:01:10] us amen because it humbles
[1:01:13] us I was sharing to brother Chad that
[1:01:16] the brother who who who who shared to me
[1:01:19] the message he was my subordinate when
[1:01:21] we were in the military service he was
[1:01:23] my subordinate when you were working in
[1:01:25] the private company and he became my
[1:01:28] pastor now can you imagine that the
[1:01:31] things that I had to to humble myself he
[1:01:35] always he doesn't call me sir he calls
[1:01:37] me he doesn't call me brother he calls
[1:01:39] me
[1:01:39] sir when he he rebukes me he calls me
[1:01:43] sir but I have to follow him and I said
[1:01:46] yes
[1:01:47] sir but I have to pass because God knows
[1:01:50] my character he could have used somebody
[1:01:53] else brother nessar was our pastor and
[1:01:56] this brother younger brother he ordained
[1:01:58] it he became a pastor for the next seven
[1:02:00] years and God was using him to to mold a
[1:02:03] character in me and I'm thankful for
[1:02:05] those times because otherwise I could
[1:02:07] have been uh more arrogant that I am
[1:02:10] right now see but God is is gracious
[1:02:13] he's mindful to you and me see and now
[1:02:17] there's another King by the name of
[1:02:19] Josiah now see the difference here in
[1:02:22] second chapter in 2 Kings chapter
[1:02:25] 22 this was the the reign of Josiah he
[1:02:28] said verse one Josiah was 8 years old
[1:02:31] when he began to rain so he's 8 years
[1:02:34] younger than Uzziah when he became a
[1:02:36] king he said and one uh his mother's
[1:02:39] name was Juda and the daughter the
[1:02:41] daughter of adaa of boscat and he did
[1:02:45] that which was right in the sight of the
[1:02:46] Lord so same testimony they started
[1:02:49] right they did what is right in the
[1:02:51] sight of the Lord and they walked all
[1:02:53] the way of David his father and he
[1:02:56] turned not aside to the right hand or to
[1:02:58] the left and it came to pass in the 18th
[1:03:02] year of King
[1:03:04] Josiah that the king of the king sent
[1:03:06] shapan the son of aelia the son of
[1:03:08] misham described to the house of the
[1:03:11] Lord saying go up to hilia the high
[1:03:13] priest that they may sum the silver
[1:03:15] which is brought unto the house of the
[1:03:16] Lord which the keepers of the door of
[1:03:18] gathered of the people so his mandate at
[1:03:21] this time was to rebuild the Temple s
[1:03:24] money talk to the high priest rebuild
[1:03:26] the Temple and while were they were in
[1:03:29] the process of rebuilding the temple
[1:03:31] hilia the high priest found the book the
[1:03:35] the the book of
[1:03:37] law he said and when he found the book
[1:03:40] of law he brought it to shaan the Scribe
[1:03:43] and brought it to the king and the King
[1:03:44] said read the book of Law and when he
[1:03:49] heard the book of law being being read
[1:03:51] to him he found out that they were not
[1:03:54] not following the book of the law they
[1:03:57] were guilty of disobeying God's Will and
[1:04:00] their time and there's judgment that
[1:04:03] goes with it and so here is here now is
[1:04:08] uh Josiah right and uh uh as a king he
[1:04:14] ordered the whole Kingdom he rent his
[1:04:16] clothes ordered the kingdom to to fast
[1:04:19] and to to
[1:04:21] seek the the wisdom from hula the
[1:04:23] prophet
[1:04:25] so you here you see the character of the
[1:04:27] king he goes to the high priest he goes
[1:04:30] to the Scribe he goes to the prophetes
[1:04:33] he wants to know the will of God he had
[1:04:36] the right
[1:04:37] reaction and
[1:04:40] when uh
[1:04:43] when Josiah I mean the prophetes who the
[1:04:47] the prophetes was saying that this will
[1:04:49] be the Judgment for your people because
[1:04:51] you did not obey the law
[1:04:55] right but here in verse 19 he said uh
[1:04:59] chapter 22: 19 he said because thine
[1:05:01] heart was tender referring to Josiah and
[1:05:04] thou was humbled thyself before the Lord
[1:05:08] when thou he heard what I spake against
[1:05:11] this place and against the inhabitants
[1:05:13] there thereof that they should become a
[1:05:16] desolation and a curse and the rent thy
[1:05:18] clothes and web before me I also have
[1:05:21] heard Thee sayth the Lord so you see the
[1:05:24] vast difference from King Uzziah and
[1:05:27] King Josiah when he was corrected he got
[1:05:31] angry Uzziah but Josiah when he heard
[1:05:34] the book of the law he felt the
[1:05:37] correction he humbled himself and the
[1:05:39] Bible said there was no other king like
[1:05:42] him he destroyed the the high places
[1:05:47] idolatry they even uh uh uneed the the
[1:05:52] pre the the the Boreal of the priests
[1:05:56] that were that led the people to
[1:05:58] idolatry they burned their bones he was
[1:06:02] so mad at the the idolatry that the the
[1:06:04] people the the earlier uh their
[1:06:06] forefathers have done why because he
[1:06:09] wanted to please God he humbled himself
[1:06:12] it was not an easy thing because during
[1:06:15] that time uh Israel was doing
[1:06:19] idolatry it was also already their
[1:06:22] lifestyle and you can imagine imine if
[1:06:24] you are the king of a country that's
[1:06:28] that's already gone far far away from
[1:06:30] the Lord you will not be very popular
[1:06:34] but he has to follow God rather than man
[1:06:36] he obeyed God he he he he he followed
[1:06:39] God in all his ways thinking and
[1:06:42] believing that he can please God which
[1:06:44] he really pleased God right and
[1:06:48] so basing on the story of these two
[1:06:51] kings like Paul like Moses they were
[1:06:54] stripped from what they think they know
[1:06:56] here are two kings right they were given
[1:07:00] the opportunity to Humble themselves and
[1:07:02] now we are always given the opportunity
[1:07:04] to Humble ourselves every single day of
[1:07:07] our life if you will just be sensitive
[1:07:09] there's always something that is
[1:07:10] humbling us
[1:07:11] am things maybe small things that God is
[1:07:15] putting in on in front of us so that he
[1:07:18] can humble Us in every step of the way
[1:07:21] but sometimes uh we are so ignorant not
[1:07:24] to to to be sens not to be sensitive in
[1:07:26] these things and we fail to Humble
[1:07:29] ourselves so if we cannot be humbled by
[1:07:32] small things God will give us big things
[1:07:34] right right it's not a threat it's the
[1:07:38] reality he gives us some not because he
[1:07:41] hates us but because God loves us that
[1:07:44] when we reach the finish line of our
[1:07:45] spiritual journey our Earthly Journey we
[1:07:48] are fully humbled in front of the Lord
[1:07:52] and we can tell the Lord we can say lord
[1:07:54] it's not me it's always you all the way
[1:07:57] all along the way it was always
[1:08:00] God we we we have not done anything so
[1:08:04] big that we can get all the credit for
[1:08:07] it see I
[1:08:10] remember uh brother lonie Jenkins when
[1:08:13] he was in in in the Philippines he was
[1:08:14] there one time 1997 and we were having a
[1:08:18] dinner and after the dinner we had
[1:08:19] coffee we were working in the hotel and
[1:08:21] he said uh it is words of wisdom he said
[1:08:25] there were Sundays that I will preach
[1:08:28] and the people will be very very blessed
[1:08:31] they will send me give me a phone call
[1:08:34] give me a card thanking me because they
[1:08:37] were blessed and the next Sunday the
[1:08:39] very next Sunday nobody will be blessed
[1:08:42] not a single one and I get disappointed
[1:08:45] he said I got disappointed because I
[1:08:48] thought I didn't do a good job and then
[1:08:50] the Lord spoke to his heart he said it's
[1:08:52] not you you have to experience these
[1:08:55] things because if every Sunday someone
[1:08:58] will approach you oh Pastor oh brother
[1:09:00] we were blessed we were blessed we were
[1:09:02] blessed it gets to your head right so
[1:09:06] sometimes it's good that nobody will say
[1:09:07] they were
[1:09:08] blessed because you realize that it's
[1:09:11] not you that's right it's not you it's
[1:09:13] always good to give compliments to
[1:09:15] people but if you like getting more
[1:09:17] compliments than giving compliments
[1:09:19] that's a dangerous thing so it's better
[1:09:22] to do things on the sides don't make it
[1:09:26] known don't don't don't make it public
[1:09:29] we are living in the days of social
[1:09:32] media that everything we do every not
[1:09:35] you but not me and not you but some
[1:09:38] people uh many people all around the
[1:09:40] world the especially everything that
[1:09:42] they will do they'll post it in
[1:09:46] Facebook they'll post the food that they
[1:09:48] ate they they they will post how they
[1:09:51] look after they wake up it's nonsense
[1:09:54] but they want to display everything
[1:09:56] because people want to be recognized it
[1:09:59] is part of uh the mow needs
[1:10:04] self-recognition people want to be
[1:10:06] recognized everywhere and anywhere see
[1:10:09] and and when we see these things we
[1:10:11] think it is good and sometimes even
[1:10:14] Believers are tempted to do the same
[1:10:17] thing right I was talking to a group of
[1:10:19] ministers and they were baptizing so
[1:10:21] many people and they were posting in
[1:10:23] baptize 10 Souls baptize 15 Souls
[1:10:25] baptize like this baptize like that and
[1:10:28] it's it seems good it seems encouraging
[1:10:32] but for me you're just blowing your
[1:10:35] horn you don't have to do it God will
[1:10:38] see it amen God will see
[1:10:42] it when I was working with with with
[1:10:45] Bible Believers in Canada uh in in in
[1:10:48] the Philippines they have this brother
[1:10:50] bcal uh had this office there and I was
[1:10:54] first three years of working with them I
[1:10:57] never got never got like a thank you
[1:11:01] card or thank you brother for what
[1:11:03] you're doing and I I was I was starting
[1:11:05] to get uh disappointed I said this is
[1:11:09] the most unrewarding Ministry because
[1:11:12] you're doing something for so many and
[1:11:14] nobody sees it and I was praying Lord
[1:11:17] what I do I have to what do and then
[1:11:19] brother Bisal sent me a letter there was
[1:11:23] no
[1:11:24] it was through his nail mail it was not
[1:11:27] email so he sent me a letter and there
[1:11:29] was a phrase there that encouraged me he
[1:11:32] said you he didn't know what I was
[1:11:35] feeling but you can sense that God was
[1:11:38] speaking through him to for me and he
[1:11:40] said brother Vernon maybe nobody has see
[1:11:45] seeing what you're doing for the Lord
[1:11:48] and in italicize he said but God sees it
[1:11:52] and it made a difference difference in
[1:11:53] my life no matter if people will not see
[1:11:57] what you're doing maybe uh you are just
[1:12:00] a young man a young woman and nobody
[1:12:03] sees what you're doing nobody's
[1:12:04] appreciating you it really doesn't
[1:12:06] matter because God sees you maybe you
[1:12:09] are now old you could before you are
[1:12:12] doing so many things for the Lord so
[1:12:14] many things for the community so many
[1:12:16] things for the church and now because
[1:12:18] you are in a retired mode you cannot
[1:12:20] move that fast anymore you canot think
[1:12:22] that fast anymore and dementia is slowly
[1:12:26] crawling in your mind you forget your
[1:12:28] name you forget everything but God saw
[1:12:31] what you did God saw what you did and
[1:12:34] that is all that matters it's not what
[1:12:37] people will say because all this people
[1:12:40] that will give compliments to you one
[1:12:42] day they will forget you right they will
[1:12:45] forget you right as I always say I was
[1:12:48] in Germany in
[1:12:51] 2008 I was there I went to a brother
[1:12:54] there was a house Bible study and a
[1:12:55] brother he said after the Bible study he
[1:12:58] says brother verer I was so blessed I
[1:13:00] was so blessed and you know as a young
[1:13:03] preacher he said
[1:13:05] oh this family was blessed because of my
[1:13:07] preaching two years later just two
[1:13:10] years 2010 I went back and I went back
[1:13:14] to the house of that brother brother ger
[1:13:15] sent me to that brother to conduct
[1:13:17] another Bible study and the brother said
[1:13:20] the same brother that gave compliments
[1:13:22] told me oh brother Veron I'm glad you've
[1:13:25] came here the first time so he didn't
[1:13:28] even remember
[1:13:30] me so sometimes people give compliments
[1:13:34] not
[1:13:35] sincerely so I told that brother and I
[1:13:37] said
[1:13:39] brother I think you were not sincere
[1:13:41] when you were complimenting me two years
[1:13:44] ago and he said sorry because uh I said
[1:13:47] there's so many foreign Brothers coming
[1:13:49] here and preaching so and I saidou are
[1:13:52] forgiven
[1:13:55] and so I came back um this year and he
[1:13:58] saw me from afar he remembered
[1:14:02] me so my point is people will compliment
[1:14:05] you they will say how blessed they are
[1:14:09] of what you did to them but don't be
[1:14:11] carried away by by those
[1:14:13] compliments be carried away that God
[1:14:16] with the thought that God sees our every
[1:14:18] move our reward is not here on Earth our
[1:14:21] reward is in heaven amen see as a pastor
[1:14:24] for the last 18 years I
[1:14:28] I sometimes you you care for the people
[1:14:31] you you preach to them you are so
[1:14:34] concerned to them and sometimes this
[1:14:36] happens in every Church in every church
[1:14:38] every every word the word there will
[1:14:40] come a rebellious Spirit speak things
[1:14:42] against you and it hurts the pastor it
[1:14:46] hurts you because you have given so much
[1:14:48] for them and because you said something
[1:14:51] in the Pulpit that hurt their feeling
[1:14:54] they'll go against you see and if you
[1:14:57] are not in tune with what God is telling
[1:15:00] you then you will get disappointed you
[1:15:03] will get depressed you will build a
[1:15:04] complex against these people even the
[1:15:06] prophet he built a complex to the people
[1:15:09] that he he was preaching to how much
[1:15:11] more myself I'm not a prophet so it's
[1:15:14] easy to build a complex to the people
[1:15:16] that you are serving and now they are
[1:15:19] going against you but again it's not
[1:15:21] about the people that you're serving
[1:15:23] you're doing it for God you are not
[1:15:25] listening to me you're listening to God
[1:15:28] I am I am preaching for you not not to
[1:15:30] please you but to please God and when I
[1:15:33] do that and that is if if that is in my
[1:15:37] thoughts people may go against you but
[1:15:39] you know in your heart that you have
[1:15:41] pleased
[1:15:42] God so we need this humbling experience
[1:15:45] we have to thank the Lord for this
[1:15:47] humbling experience that's why the
[1:15:49] prophet uh in the message God hiding
[1:15:52] himself in simplicity he said keep
[1:15:54] humbling yourself because if we will not
[1:15:57] humble ourselves God will have to Humble
[1:16:00] us and that's not an easy thing to
[1:16:03] experience but if we every day we walk
[1:16:07] uh every day we wake up every day we
[1:16:10] live a life and after the end at the end
[1:16:13] of the day we ask the Lord Lord thank
[1:16:15] you for the humbling
[1:16:17] experience thank you for all these
[1:16:19] things and if you need more ask for more
[1:16:22] see why because it builds our character
[1:16:26] and I think all of us here after many
[1:16:29] years of serving the lord we can see
[1:16:32] that we are not what we used to
[1:16:34] be God has taught us we may not be as
[1:16:38] humble as we are right now that before
[1:16:40] we were a little bit arrogant but now
[1:16:43] because of the things that you have done
[1:16:45] that is the reason why older people are
[1:16:47] so
[1:16:48] mellow they speak a little
[1:16:51] slow because they they they they want to
[1:16:54] be sure of what they're saying they're
[1:16:56] full of wisdom not because they're
[1:16:57] physically weak but because they have
[1:17:00] learned a lot they have learned a lot
[1:17:03] see and if we can be that way then we
[1:17:06] can show the other other people that we
[1:17:08] are we have learned from our uh younger
[1:17:12] years because if if you see an older man
[1:17:14] an older woman that's still so
[1:17:16] aggressive or maybe so still arrogant
[1:17:19] maybe he hasn't have that much of a
[1:17:22] humbling experience and we should pray
[1:17:25] for them that God will give them
[1:17:28] humbling
[1:17:29] experience see we should pray for them
[1:17:32] see and sometimes everything that you
[1:17:34] have accomplished it will be taken away
[1:17:36] from you everything that you have
[1:17:37] acquired can you imagine in the last
[1:17:39] pandemic there are people that I know I
[1:17:42] mean friends that are not believers they
[1:17:44] have saved and saved their money they've
[1:17:47] ensured everything all the possession
[1:17:49] and they're looking down to the people
[1:17:51] that have not saved in their life life
[1:17:53] in their lifetime see and then this
[1:17:57] pandemic came everything that they had
[1:17:59] was taken away from them even their
[1:18:02] health see just one one one sickness
[1:18:07] coid it was not even
[1:18:09] cancer but it can be easily taken away
[1:18:12] from
[1:18:13] us and we think that we have everything
[1:18:16] but we do we the prophet we have nothing
[1:18:19] we have nothing everything we are just
[1:18:22] stewards
[1:18:23] we are just the wordss you
[1:18:26] see sometimes uh I always do this for um
[1:18:33] for the young Professionals in in the
[1:18:37] Philippines if there's like uh I would
[1:18:39] say like a a a seminar we we call it a
[1:18:43] seminar so we can attract the young
[1:18:45] professionals to come because if it's a
[1:18:47] church service they might not want to
[1:18:50] come so but it's about Christian Life in
[1:18:52] the second secular world see and we
[1:18:55] always uh or I would say I always uh
[1:18:59] tell tell this this these people the the
[1:19:03] young people that in our life there's
[1:19:06] always these stages right um you God
[1:19:10] will give you uh you will start in in a
[1:19:13] company that you're working for your an
[1:19:15] employee then you get promoted you
[1:19:17] become a supervisor and then you got
[1:19:19] promoted you become a manager or a
[1:19:21] leader of a certain group then you
[1:19:24] realize from
[1:19:25] management right you become you you you
[1:19:29] acquire position then there's ownership
[1:19:32] sometimes you start owning your company
[1:19:34] owning your house owning these things
[1:19:37] but as you get older you realize it's
[1:19:40] not about ownership it's about
[1:19:42] stewardship that everything we have
[1:19:46] relationship money material things it's
[1:19:48] just we don't own that we don't even own
[1:19:51] our own family we are stewards of these
[1:19:54] things at the end of the road we will be
[1:19:57] accountable of how we manage our family
[1:20:01] our finances even the ministry that the
[1:20:04] Lord has given us I always look at
[1:20:06] myself and I say this is the ministry
[1:20:09] that the Lord has given me from the time
[1:20:11] I started doing Ministry at age 33 at
[1:20:14] this point in time in my life and if the
[1:20:16] Lord will T and will entrust more
[1:20:18] Ministry to me I said one day I will
[1:20:21] stop one day I this I I don't own my
[1:20:25] Ministry it was just a privilege that
[1:20:27] the Lord has given me and at the end of
[1:20:29] all these things I'll be accountable how
[1:20:32] did I use my time how did I use my
[1:20:34] position how did I use the influence
[1:20:38] that the Lord has given me how did uh uh
[1:20:41] I use the Ability that he has given me
[1:20:44] if I have used it for my own good or for
[1:20:48] for for to to to make myself known that
[1:20:52] then I have
[1:20:53] failed but if you have used all these
[1:20:56] things to glorify God in our life to
[1:20:58] live a life that's worthy of the Gospel
[1:21:00] to please God and to be to be a blessing
[1:21:03] to others then and only then we can say
[1:21:06] that we are good stewards of the
[1:21:08] mysteries of God because at the end of
[1:21:10] the day we will leave everything
[1:21:12] everything yes
[1:21:16] see in the last I I'll be closing on
[1:21:20] this thought last January I had three
[1:21:23] God has blessed with with three mentors
[1:21:25] in my life in the ministry aside from uh
[1:21:28] my former Pastor in the Philippines
[1:21:30] brother Nestor God has used three Elder
[1:21:33] ministers in my life when I say used
[1:21:36] because I have direct contact with them
[1:21:38] I work with them in the mission field
[1:21:40] and I have received uh I mean their
[1:21:42] Ministry has a great influence in my
[1:21:45] life one of them is brother Ed bcal from
[1:21:47] Cloverdale who is now 89 years old
[1:21:50] another is brother ger rodal is now 83
[1:21:53] years old in Germany so from Canada from
[1:21:55] Germany and another brother from Georgia
[1:21:58] uh a church that I came from last week
[1:22:00] brother Samu Dale uh who who is now 83
[1:22:04] and is also uh all of them are sick
[1:22:06] except brother ger who can still
[1:22:09] preach and I as I see last January I
[1:22:12] prayed Lord I want to visit them these
[1:22:15] are in different countries I want to
[1:22:17] visit them because I don't want to go to
[1:22:19] their funeral they're already dead I
[1:22:22] want to talk to them personally and
[1:22:24] thank them personally for their impact
[1:22:26] in my life and I want to like to hear
[1:22:30] the the the last words of wisdom that
[1:22:32] they can pass on through me and I was
[1:22:35] praying and praying and then um it came
[1:22:38] to past I'm now in the US I just came
[1:22:40] from Georgia I was in Germany last uh uh
[1:22:44] August and I was in uh Clover day last
[1:22:47] June it was not a long trip I just spent
[1:22:50] time with them talk to them and I was
[1:22:53] um happy that they still remember my
[1:22:56] name because there's slowly sleeping
[1:22:59] away from you know their their minds and
[1:23:02] when I saw brother bcal and I realized
[1:23:04] it was a uh something that catched my
[1:23:08] attention in all these three brothers
[1:23:10] they have done so many things in the
[1:23:12] mission field for the kingdom of God for
[1:23:15] the glory of God of course I'm not
[1:23:17] saying that they are perfect they have
[1:23:18] their own faults and that that is what
[1:23:20] make us perfect when you have faults
[1:23:23] right without faults we are not perfect
[1:23:25] so I thank the Lord for their
[1:23:27] imperfection and but I learned from them
[1:23:30] but at the end of the ministry it's not
[1:23:32] it's not a bad thing it's not a negative
[1:23:33] thing but at the end of the ministry I
[1:23:35] realized that we are just all
[1:23:37] stewards of God what God has given us am
[1:23:41] now brother bisc is not preaching
[1:23:44] anymore he's in a home care being taken
[1:23:48] care of brother Samuel Dale from Georgia
[1:23:53] uh is's he's having
[1:23:55] dementia and I I I just felt sad to see
[1:23:59] them that way but I I I I thank the Lord
[1:24:02] because I've gained something from them
[1:24:04] and brother guard is get slowly getting
[1:24:06] weaker but it came to my mind that these
[1:24:10] are just temporary things that the Lord
[1:24:12] allows us to do it's not permanent
[1:24:15] somebody some someday somebody will
[1:24:17] replace us somebody that may even be
[1:24:20] better than us or may be lesser than us
[1:24:23] but it really doesn't matter because it
[1:24:24] is not a permanent thing I believe that
[1:24:27] they have been good stewards of the
[1:24:28] ministry that the Lord has entrusted to
[1:24:30] them I'm thankful that I learned from
[1:24:32] them but it it teach it it taught me
[1:24:35] something that what I what I have today
[1:24:38] one day it will be taken away the
[1:24:41] strength the intelligence and everything
[1:24:45] you'll just go back to Childhood see
[1:24:48] you'll just be carried around right but
[1:24:53] as long as we live as long as we are
[1:24:55] strong and God can use us let us be used
[1:24:57] by God but never ever go to a point that
[1:25:02] you think that you are being used by God
[1:25:04] because of your ability because it's
[1:25:06] not you may whatever Ministry that the
[1:25:09] Lord has given it's just privilege and
[1:25:12] for me I've been saying that many years
[1:25:14] ago but now it's becoming a reality
[1:25:17] because I'm getting
[1:25:18] older what used to be a theory now is
[1:25:21] becoming a reality and I said one day
[1:25:24] one day I'll be stopping my Ministry I
[1:25:26] don't know when I don't know how but I
[1:25:29] asked Lord if my time is over and I
[1:25:32] cannot preach anymore bar I just want to
[1:25:34] go home I don't want to be sitting in a
[1:25:38] wheelchair it's nothing bad about it but
[1:25:41] I'm a very active person I cannot I
[1:25:44] don't want to be to be bedridden I I
[1:25:48] said Lord if I will be a good Steward
[1:25:51] maybe if my time is over he just take me
[1:25:54] quietly we have an adage in in the
[1:25:57] military when a general is retiring he
[1:26:00] would say old soldiers never die they
[1:26:04] just fade
[1:26:05] away we are soldiers of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:07] Christ one day we will fade away nobody
[1:26:10] will even uh uh look for you nobody will
[1:26:15] say who he he is the for he was our
[1:26:18] former Pastor no once somebody takes
[1:26:22] your place even in a company in a family
[1:26:26] you will just be a
[1:26:27] memory and sometimes people forgets
[1:26:30] easily so it will not even be a memory
[1:26:34] right so again it's not about the person
[1:26:36] it's about the work of the Lord God's
[1:26:38] work is always in continuity if the Lord
[1:26:41] will t for the next 100 years there will
[1:26:43] be new set of people they will forget
[1:26:45] you they will forget me they even though
[1:26:47] we put everything on the website it will
[1:26:49] be lost that's right they will for
[1:26:52] forget everything but as long as the
[1:26:54] Lord God saw that you have became a good
[1:26:57] Steward that will last until eternity we
[1:27:00] have all eternity to talk
[1:27:02] about the opportunities that the Lord
[1:27:05] has given us and it it it it it
[1:27:08] encourages me my brothers my sisters to
[1:27:11] do more for the Lord not because of the
[1:27:14] people not because of the the
[1:27:16] compliments that I may receive but
[1:27:19] because God sees us God will see you and
[1:27:23] God will see you in the next life and
[1:27:26] we'll just be thankful Lord thank you
[1:27:28] for all the things that you have given
[1:27:30] me the Blessed opportunity to serve you

[1:27:43] so God bless you all and I pray that uh

[1:28:46] life there are experiences in our life
[1:28:49] that seems to be negative that seems to
[1:28:51] be
[1:28:52] uh bad things that happen in your life
[1:28:54] but there's no negative thing there's no
[1:28:56] bad thing that is happening in our life
[1:28:58] everything was allowed for a reason for
[1:29:00] a purpose and it is for our character
[1:29:03] development it is for our own good you
[1:29:06] made us humble in your in in in in in in
[1:29:09] front of you Lord you allowed us uh to
[1:29:13] to do things for your glory and Lord
[1:29:18] sometimes you give us failure and
[1:29:20] disappointments so that we may realize
[1:29:23] that it's not it's not our intellect
[1:29:25] it's not our ability it is because you
[1:29:28] loved us that you called us and used us
[1:29:32] to be a blessing to others may you
[1:29:34] continue to use this whole congregation
[1:29:36] from the pastor down to the youngest
[1:29:39] member Lord to be a blessing to many
[1:29:41] people and uh Lord I pray that you will
[1:29:45] grant the desire of each and everyone

[1:30:15] light my
[1:30:18] L and the more that I release my care
[1:30:26] the more you take
[1:30:30] control and the more that I can humble

[1:31:50] ourselves cuz if if we don't he'll help
[1:31:52] us and like the brother was saying
[1:31:55] that's not so easy but in the end we'll
[1:31:58] always be thankful there was one word
[1:32:00] that he was preaching there at the end
[1:32:01] that really meant something to me and
[1:32:03] that really hit me with impact was the
[1:32:05] word stewardship that's a great takeaway
[1:32:07] for me something to always think about
[1:32:09] we're stewards amen we're not the
[1:32:11] creators he's the Creator we're not the
[1:32:13] one who gives gifts he gave gifts we're
[1:32:15] stewards over what he's given amen and
[1:32:19] one thing brother uh brother Vernon was
[1:32:21] sharing with us is about the word
[1:32:23] ministry remember when we were talking
[1:32:25] about gifts the word ministry is not
[1:32:27] necessarily pull pit Ministry the word
[1:32:29] ministry is to serve in whatever
[1:32:31] capacity God's given you to serve the
[1:32:33] rest of the body that's your
[1:32:35] ministry and I want to be a steward a
[1:32:38] faithful Steward I want to I I don't
[1:32:41] want to I don't want to waste all the
[1:32:43] opportunities I have and I'm ashamed
[1:32:45] that so many times that I've wasted and
[1:32:47] squandered and I'm ashamed of the
[1:32:49] failures in the past but I'm determined
[1:32:51] after hearing hearing this today to be a
[1:32:52] good Steward amen I want to be a good
[1:32:55] and faithful Steward I also saw brother
[1:32:58] Arley stutzman over here God bless you

[1:33:06] to remind you all of communion and feet
[1:33:08] washing back here at 400 p.m. brother
