[7:47] and for us the supernatural is becoming
[7:51] a natural part of life amen
[7:54] praise be to god i'd like to
[7:57] read this scripture here in the gospel
[7:59] of john chapter
[8:01] 5 verse 39
[8:05] john 5 and 39 search the scriptures for
[8:09] in them you think you have eternal life
[8:11] and they are they which testify of me
[8:14] so we're going to continue on with part
[8:16] 11 in this series
[8:18] of search the scriptures for in them you
[8:20] think you have eternal life and they are
[8:22] they
[8:22] which testify of me only we're taking it
[8:25] from from another angle jesus was here
[8:28] he was the word made manifest in his day
[8:32] and the word made manifest in his day
[8:35] was contending with religious leaders
[8:37] who refuting the things that he was
[8:39] saying and he tells them
[8:40] just search the scriptures amen the
[8:43] scriptures are testifying of me
[8:46] and now the bride is here is the word
[8:48] made manifest
[8:49] in this day amen and all kinds of
[8:52] spirits and religious leaders are trying
[8:53] to contest that
[8:54] but all you need to do is search the
[8:56] scriptures for they testify of who she
[8:59] is
[9:00] amen all the christ types when you look
[9:03] down through the bible
[9:04] and you and you see moses amen and you
[9:06] see joseph and you see all these christ
[9:08] types
[9:09] if you look you'll see a gentile bride
[9:11] there too there's always a type of the
[9:13] gentile bride
[9:14] along with the type of christ all the
[9:16] way down through
[9:18] and so we truly can say search the
[9:20] scriptures
[9:22] in them that's what you're resting
[9:24] eternal life on you're trusting your
[9:26] eternal destination on these words in
[9:28] this bible
[9:29] and it's the same words that are
[9:30] testifying of this bride
[9:34] hallelujah let's just bow our heads and
[9:36] pray
[9:38] dear heavenly father we thank you lord

[9:42] live in lord

[11:17] god bless you let's turn together to
[11:19] matthew chapter one
[11:21] we've been through these scriptures so
[11:22] many times i i looked and i believe this
[11:25] is number 11
[11:27] in this series but we've had such a
[11:28] wonderful time looking through the first
[11:31] chapter
[11:31] of the book of matthew amen and so i'd
[11:35] like to just
[11:36] uh read the first six verses again and
[11:38] then we'll skip down
[11:40] and and pick up mary today we would like
[11:42] to talk about mary
[11:43] amen we've talked about these four women
[11:45] in this first six verses and we went
[11:47] through each one
[11:48] we've talked about tamar and and how
[11:50] tamar had come into the line of judah
[11:52] but
[11:52] but there was no conception no seed and
[11:54] and finally
[11:56] amen through the fourth stage of her
[11:57] journey she has to go back to the
[11:59] original seed which is judah himself
[12:01] and then she has to play the part of a
[12:03] harlot to do so
[12:04] and she goes back to the original seed
[12:06] giver him and not the sons but back to
[12:08] the original
[12:10] seed back to judah and she conceives
[12:12] judah's fourth child
[12:13] who gets the birthright amen who comes
[12:16] on down through the line
[12:17] then we come down to rahab the harlot of
[12:20] jericho and she's playing the part of
[12:22] harlot she's a gentile
[12:23] amen but when they come to possess the
[12:25] land because of her faith in the message
[12:28] of her
[12:28] hour of her day she is spared and she's
[12:30] given a true token
[12:32] and all that will believe her and come
[12:33] under that token are spared as well
[12:36] and then she's taken outside the city
[12:38] and and she's outside of denominations
[12:40] she's outside of the camp of israel
[12:42] amen but there's a prince in the house
[12:44] of judah this same
[12:45] bloodline that's coming all the way down
[12:48] the line of david coming all the way
[12:50] down to christ
[12:51] amen right in there there's a prince
[12:53] named salmon
[12:54] and salmon takes a stroll one day
[12:56] outside the camp amen
[12:58] because we meet him outside the camp
[13:00] amen he was crucified outside the camp
[13:02] and we meet him outside the camp
[13:04] and these two meet and they're married
[13:06] and now solomon
[13:07] the prince of the house of judah one of
[13:09] the most eligible
[13:11] bachelors of his day takes the harlot
[13:14] of jericho probably
[13:18] probably one of the most gossiped about
[13:21] events in all the camp of israel
[13:24] probably one of the most misunderstood
[13:26] acts that was taking place in that day
[13:28] that people couldn't imagine amen we've
[13:30] got a commandment we're not supposed to
[13:32] do these things moses
[13:34] has told us not to marry outside of
[13:36] israel
[13:37] and now here's solomon amen he is the
[13:39] prince of the house of judah
[13:41] he's in the line of the birthright and
[13:43] can you imagine all the talking that was
[13:45] going on all over him and
[13:46] at the dinner tables at the quiet times
[13:49] at the well
[13:50] amen at the gatherings they're they're
[13:52] all but it's god
[13:53] amen god's painting a picture god's
[13:56] laying a shadow amen
[13:57] so that he was foreshadowing things that
[13:59] are to come amen in that day it was
[14:02] probably the most misunderstood event of
[14:04] the day
[14:05] but it's the very thing that we can look
[14:07] back on and say see
[14:08] there it is search the scriptures they
[14:11] are they that testify of me
[14:13] no matter what my condition no matter
[14:15] what denomination belief i had
[14:16] no matter what amen no matter what i
[14:19] have i
[14:20] have been feasting on and what i have
[14:22] been believing that was false
[14:24] amen there comes a time that i can meet
[14:26] christ outside the camp
[14:27] amen and through marriage i can be
[14:29] justified and brought into the camp
[14:33] and so now these things that we we read
[14:35] through these scriptures and it's so
[14:36] easy
[14:37] just to read scripture scriptures are
[14:39] easy to read
[14:40] but they were hard to live
[14:44] i mean it's easy to read through tamar i
[14:46] mean you can just read right through it
[14:47] it doesn't take very long
[14:49] by the time you're done it's a happy
[14:51] ending
[14:53] but when it was being fleshed out when
[14:56] the scriptures were being lived
[14:57] it wasn't that easy for tamar it wasn't
[15:00] that easy for rahab
[15:02] it wasn't that easy for ruth and naomi
[15:04] amen they were misunderstood
[15:06] they were misjudged amen they didn't
[15:08] know themselves sometimes what was going
[15:10] on in their lives they didn't know why
[15:12] they had fallen into these situations
[15:14] why life had taken the turns it had
[15:16] taken why they were in catastrophe
[15:18] why they were in chaos why they were in
[15:21] trouble
[15:23] and the whole reason is for you and i
[15:25] here today
[15:27] they're passing through troubles they're
[15:29] passing through trials
[15:30] and what's happening god is writing his
[15:32] bible
[15:33] [Applause]
[15:35] tamar amen first husband he's evil and
[15:38] wicked and he dies amen do you know what
[15:40] that experience is like for a woman and
[15:42] then she's married
[15:43] she's going to have a family and her
[15:45] husband dies
[15:47] these aren't easy things
[15:50] then she's going down and now the the
[15:53] second one who's going to come
[15:54] and the the second son is going to raise
[15:56] up seed now she's going to have a
[15:57] heritage she's going to have
[15:59] a son named that's going to take care of
[16:01] her she's going to have provisions
[16:02] and now he refuses now she sent back to
[16:06] her father's house
[16:07] waiting for the third son but judah
[16:08] refuses to give the third son
[16:10] amen and now she's she's in trouble i
[16:13] mean she's in
[16:14] tribulation she has no heritage she has
[16:16] she has
[16:17] nothing amen for the future so she does
[16:20] something that
[16:20] seems impossible to be done in a
[16:23] righteous line
[16:24] seems like there's no way god is going
[16:26] to honor what tamar will do
[16:28] but tamar will dress up like a harlot
[16:30] and deceive
[16:32] her father-in-law judah into lying with
[16:34] her so that she can see
[16:35] seed and then to raise up amen a son
[16:38] unto judah
[16:39] to replace the one that was refused her
[16:43] and seemingly this is there's no way
[16:46] god can write his bible this way but
[16:49] that's how he wrote it
[16:51] it seems like if if i may have said this
[16:53] before but if i was god and i was
[16:55] writing the bible i would write it
[16:57] differently
[16:58] but i guess if i was god i'd write it
[17:00] the same way because i'd be god
[17:04] if i was god with the mind i have now
[17:05] with the temperament i have now
[17:07] with the carnality that is embedded in
[17:09] me right now they would be clean i would
[17:11] leave out all the bad parts
[17:13] i would make it look so nice and you
[17:15] would read the bible that i would write
[17:16] and you'd be like they were all perfect
[17:18] people amen
[17:22] hallelujah it's like
[17:25] you know so many people on facebook
[17:31] you know all you're getting is the
[17:32] highlights i mean all you're getting is
[17:34] the golden stuff
[17:35] all you get is like the perfect family
[17:36] stuff everybody smiling in front of
[17:38] you know in front of the lighthouse on
[17:40] the beach they don't take
[17:41] pictures or record the argument on the
[17:43] way there because somebody crossed the
[17:45] line in the seat and his legs on my side
[17:52] all right we don't tell the whole story
[17:56] but god told the whole story because
[17:59] he's laying a
[18:00] shadow right
[18:03] he he's laying a shadow that is so
[18:05] misunderstood in the day that it's
[18:07] happening
[18:11] the levites may not have understood what
[18:14] salman was doing
[18:16] can you imagine the good advice he must
[18:19] have had from so many friends
[18:23] can you imagine the conversations he had
[18:25] with concerned clergy
[18:28] [Music]
[18:31] solomon d i mean do you know that the
[18:34] birthrights
[18:34] do you know that you're going to pollute
[18:36] the bloodline do you know
[18:38] this is a harlot in jericho not of
[18:41] israel she
[18:42] didn't come from jacob do you know that
[18:44] we're not supposed to do this
[18:45] amen and maybe solomon had no
[18:48] explanation
[18:52] maybe solomon couldn't defend himself
[18:54] maybe all he could say
[18:56] is i don't know i just know this is
[18:58] right
[19:00] how is it right show me where moses said
[19:02] let just
[19:03] just just tell me how it's right i don't
[19:05] know i just know it's right
[19:09] hallelujah so solomon takes rahab amen
[19:13] and no doubt there was a mystery
[19:15] surrounding that
[19:16] and it might have been scandalous in
[19:18] that day so the bible
[19:20] the writing of the bible was not clean
[19:22] and it was not easy
[19:24] and they weren't just skipping through
[19:25] the land amen and everything was
[19:27] wonderful
[19:28] as god was telling these stories and
[19:30] writing out his bible
[19:31] it came through hardship it came through
[19:33] misunderstanding
[19:35] it came through false accusations
[19:38] but god had his way nonetheless
[19:42] in in and solomon and
[19:46] rahab would have a son named obed and
[19:49] obed would be
[19:50] a great man in bethlehem and we know
[19:52] solomon and rahab would establish
[19:55] amen established the city or the village
[19:58] of bethlehem
[19:59] and bethlehem was going to be the place
[20:01] where christ was going to be born
[20:02] the house of god's bread and they
[20:04] established bethlehem
[20:06] and then boaz comes up and is a great
[20:08] man in bethlehem
[20:09] and how is it that boaz the most
[20:12] eligible man
[20:14] in bethlehem he was a great man he was a
[20:18] wealthy man
[20:19] no doubt that there were maidens in that
[20:21] day they would have loved to have
[20:23] snagged boaz
[20:26] right but maybe boaz was the ugliest man
[20:29] in bethlehem i don't know
[20:32] but something somehow we find that boaz
[20:36] is not married and has no
[20:38] amen he has he has no birthright son
[20:41] to take his place amen in the story of
[20:44] naomi and ruth coming into the land
[20:47] you find that elimelech leads his family
[20:49] out of the promised land
[20:51] into moab why did he do that who knows
[20:53] was it right
[20:54] no it was wrong but it was right
[20:59] it was wrong he was told not to do it he
[21:01] wasn't supposed to do it a jew was never
[21:03] blessed outside of his homeland
[21:04] outside of his portion of land he
[21:06] shouldn't have done it
[21:08] but yet he had to do it you see because
[21:10] there's got to be a story a of naomi
[21:13] coming back into the land
[21:14] and as she's coming back into the land
[21:16] there's got to be a gentile bride coming
[21:18] back with her who is going to unite with
[21:20] the kinsmen redeemer
[21:21] it has to happen this way this is the
[21:23] way the bible has to be wrote
[21:25] and a lima like may not know why he's
[21:27] doing what he's doing
[21:28] and does elimelech suffer for it he
[21:30] suffers for it
[21:32] see what we have amen in just a few
[21:35] verses
[21:36] is we have a hard life lived we have
[21:39] people who live
[21:40] through difficult circumstances so that
[21:42] you and i could say search the
[21:44] scriptures
[21:45] they are they that testify of me
[21:47] [Applause]
[21:48] all these things happen for our examples
[21:52] apostle paul he comes and he says now
[21:55] now don't be like those in the
[21:57] wilderness who lusted after flesh and
[21:58] lust and don't do this and
[22:00] don't do that and these things were
[22:01] given for our examples
[22:04] these things happen he says for our
[22:06] example they didn't happen for them
[22:08] they happened for us ray apple was not a
[22:12] harlot for herself she was a harlot for
[22:14] me
[22:18] amen naomi and ruth weren't destitute
[22:21] for them they were destitute for me amen
[22:24] ruth wasn't wasn't forsaken amen she
[22:27] wasn't destitute
[22:28] and going back in poverty back with her
[22:30] mother-in-law
[22:31] with no hope of the future for her she
[22:33] went through that for me
[22:36] hallelujah and if that's god how how
[22:40] god wrote his bible amen to foreshadow
[22:42] what's happening today
[22:43] what do you think it's going to be like
[22:45] to live this word today
[22:47] is it going to be easy no is there going
[22:49] to be misunderstandings
[22:51] absolutely are there going to be
[22:53] concerned clergy
[22:54] absolutely will there be things that
[22:57] look wrong but are right
[22:59] absolutely that's the way it's going to
[23:01] be that's the way the shadow is laid
[23:03] down
[23:04] it's being fleshed out the same way
[23:05] today amen
[23:07] you live a misunderstood life
[23:11] praise be to god i'm in good company
[23:15] misjudged amen doing things that don't
[23:18] always make sense
[23:19] amen moving in places and going ways
[23:21] that don't seem to make sense
[23:23] having trouble amen hit us and drive us
[23:26] in the places we don't want to be
[23:27] amen but god if he did that to lay down
[23:30] the shadow
[23:31] now when it comes time for the reality
[23:33] to be displayed on this earth he's going
[23:35] to do the same things amen
[23:36] strike us in ways we don't want to be
[23:38] stricken smitten us in ways we don't
[23:40] want to be smitten
[23:41] move us into positions in places we
[23:43] don't want to be
[23:45] why because now it's time to display
[23:49] what the shadow's been foreshowing
[23:54] then obed now takes
[23:57] ruth and you know
[24:01] roots of there was another nearer
[24:05] kinsman
[24:05] amen that wanted to redeem naomi's land
[24:08] wanted the inheritance
[24:09] but he said if you get the inheritance
[24:11] you have to take the moabitess
[24:13] to raise up seed to the dead and he says
[24:15] i don't want that i don't want her
[24:18] amen ruth wasn't something that they
[24:20] were all seeking after amen
[24:22] amen they she was she was rejected
[24:25] because of marring the inheritance
[24:28] but obed wasn't concerned about marring
[24:31] his inheritance
[24:33] he was willing to share his inheritance
[24:36] and he made ruth a joint heir
[24:40] because christ is not worried about
[24:42] marrying his inheritance by taking you
[24:44] and i
[24:45] amen he's not marring his inheritance by
[24:47] taking you and i
[24:48] he's willing to share his inheritance
[24:52] and make us a joint heir
[24:56] amen and then ruthing
[25:00] boaz have obed and obed begins becomes a
[25:04] a restorer of life and inertia of old
[25:06] age to naomi
[25:07] and obed is given to naomi and naomi
[25:09] becomes the foster mother of obed
[25:11] and you never hear anything more about
[25:13] ruth amen because this
[25:14] this gentile message will go back to the
[25:17] jews
[25:21] oh all of this god is foreshadowing our
[25:26] day
[25:28] and then we go a little further obed
[25:31] begets jesse
[25:32] jessica gets david and david begets
[25:34] salman
[25:35] of her that was the wife of uriah
[25:38] then you move into a scandal in the
[25:41] kingdom
[25:43] where david does something so scandalous
[25:46] he takes another man's wife and
[25:48] has the man murdered and tries to cover
[25:51] up what he's done and
[25:52] we've been through this and you
[25:53] understand it well but through the
[25:55] scandal through the wrong
[25:57] god is foreshadowing our day
[26:01] and you think it was easy for bathsheba
[26:04] we know it wasn't easy for uriah
[26:08] it wasn't easy for bathsheba it wasn't
[26:10] easy for david
[26:11] it wasn't easy for the kingdom it wasn't
[26:13] easy for those that were around and
[26:15] witnessed this
[26:15] it was a confusing time could you
[26:18] imagine working for david
[26:20] and you're watching all this happen as a
[26:22] servant you see her come you see her go
[26:25] you see a message relayed
[26:26] amen and you hear about what happened
[26:28] and you start to piece together what's
[26:30] going on
[26:31] can you imagine what it would be like to
[26:33] live in that day
[26:35] this is your king
[26:38] but god is writing his bible
[26:43] let's read matthew chapter 1
[26:48] verse 1. the book of degeneration of
[26:51] jesus
[26:52] christ the son of david the son of
[26:53] abraham abraham begot isaac and isaac
[26:56] begot jacob and jacob begot judas and
[26:58] his brethren
[27:00] and judas begot pharas and zerzera of
[27:03] tamar
[27:03] tamar is the first woman mentioned in
[27:05] this lineage and pharas begat ezram and
[27:08] ezram begat aram and aram began a meena
[27:10] dab and amina debbie got neyasan and
[27:12] naasembe got salman
[27:14] and salman begot boaz of rahab second
[27:16] woman mentioned
[27:18] and boazby got obed of ruth third woman
[27:20] mentioned
[27:21] and obed begot jesse and jesse begot
[27:23] david the king and david the king begot
[27:25] solomon
[27:26] solomon of her that had been wife of
[27:28] urias
[27:29] third woman or fourth woman mentioned
[27:32] this is bathsheba
[27:33] so in the first six verses coming to
[27:35] solomon we have four
[27:37] gentile women and the four gentile women
[27:41] and then after this there's no more
[27:43] gentile women listed so right here
[27:45] clustered
[27:46] in these first few verses are these
[27:48] gentile women because
[27:49] we have four stages amen of the wheat
[27:51] plant
[27:52] coming back to life we have four uh we
[27:55] have four anointings on the church ages
[27:57] amen
[27:58] so we have this four the number of
[27:59] deliverance also four amen
[28:01] is his number back to seed and so
[28:04] solomon is a type of christ
[28:06] and and in solomon's day he brought them
[28:08] to the golden age of israel brother
[28:10] branham said a type of the millennial
[28:11] reign of christ
[28:13] and so now solomon is a type of christ
[28:15] bring him to the millennium
[28:16] so now you see there's four gentile
[28:19] women
[28:19] used to bring about christ
[28:24] in the millennium in typing in shadow
[28:28] and from that point on israel was
[28:32] downhill
[28:33] that was the highest point for the
[28:35] nation that was the highest point for
[28:37] their spirituality
[28:38] that was the highest point for their
[28:40] peace and their prosperity
[28:41] amen and their world influence that was
[28:43] the highest point and from then on
[28:45] it slips downhill and there's not a
[28:48] gentile woman
[28:49] mentioned in the slipping downhill the
[28:52] gentiles
[28:52] are mentioned in the building of the
[28:54] kingdom of the type of christ
[28:58] god is foreshadowing in the first six
[29:01] verses what the entire new testament is
[29:04] about
[29:05] it's about these gentile women coming
[29:07] through the church ages building back to
[29:09] christ
[29:09] coming in a millennium sitting on the
[29:11] throne of his father david
[29:14] hallelujah so then we go through
[29:17] we read down and there's many more
[29:19] verses it's all this one begot this one
[29:21] this one begot that one no more women
[29:23] mentioned
[29:24] but there's another woman mentioned in
[29:25] the first chapter of matthew
[29:27] that we haven't talked about yet and
[29:29] we'll pick it up in verse
[29:30] 16. and jacob begot joseph the husband
[29:35] of mary
[29:36] of whom was born jesus who is called
[29:38] christ
[29:40] so here we have the fifth woman who's
[29:42] mentioned
[29:43] in the genealogy of jesus christ and
[29:46] this woman is mary
[29:47] the virgin let's read it again and jacob
[29:50] begot joseph the husband of mary of whom
[29:52] was born jesus who was called christ
[29:54] so all the generations from abraham to
[29:56] david are 14 generations
[29:58] and from david until the carrying away
[30:00] into babylon are 14 generations
[30:02] from the carrying away in babylon unto
[30:04] christ are 14 generations
[30:06] now the birth of christ was on this wise
[30:09] when is his
[30:10] when as his mother mary was espoused to
[30:12] joseph before they came together
[30:14] she was found with child of the holy
[30:16] ghost then joseph her husband being a
[30:19] just man and not willing to make her a
[30:20] public example
[30:22] was minded to put her away privately but
[30:24] while he thought on these things behold
[30:26] the angel of the lord appeared unto him
[30:28] in a dream
[30:28] saying joseph the son of david fear not
[30:31] to take unto thee mary thy wife
[30:33] for that which is conceived in her is of
[30:35] the holy ghost
[30:37] so that makes the holy ghost jesus
[30:39] father
[30:41] amen he didn't have two fathers he only
[30:44] had one
[30:47] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[30:49] shalt call his name
[30:50] jesus for he shall save his people from
[30:53] their sins
[30:54] now all this was done then it might be
[30:56] fulfilled which was spoken of the
[30:57] prophet of the lord by the prophet
[30:59] saying
[31:00] behold a virgin shall be with child and
[31:02] shall bring forth a son
[31:04] and they shall call his name immanuel
[31:06] which being interpreted is god with us
[31:09] then joseph being raised from sleep did
[31:11] as the angel of the lord had
[31:12] bidden him and took unto him his wife
[31:15] and knew her not till she had brought
[31:17] forth her firstborn son
[31:19] and he called his name jesus
[31:22] so now we want to look today at mary and
[31:24] mary
[31:26] mary is the number five she's the fifth
[31:28] woman mentioned in this genealogy
[31:30] and brother branham tells us five is the
[31:32] number of grace
[31:33] so this is the nut this is miss grace
[31:36] this is the elect lady
[31:38] amen brother branham says in
[31:44] well no let's look at luke let's let's
[31:45] take this same story over in luke
[31:47] chapter one
[31:48] you turn with me to the gospel of luke
[31:51] chapter one
[31:52] and we'll begin reading in verse 26.
[32:03] and in the sixth month i love that
[32:07] because what did the six seals reveal
[32:09] the seventh
[32:11] hallelujah in the sixth month the angel
[32:14] gabriel was sent from god
[32:16] unto a city of galilee named nazareth to
[32:19] a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[32:21] was joseph
[32:22] of the house of david and the virgin's
[32:24] name was mary
[32:26] and the angel came in unto her and said
[32:27] hail thou art highly
[32:29] favored the lord is with thee blessed
[32:32] art thou
[32:32] among women now let's imagine like i
[32:35] said before
[32:36] let's not just read the scripture and be
[32:38] like oh that's a neat story in the story
[32:40] book
[32:40] but no here's here's a virgin girl this
[32:43] is a
[32:43] this is a young woman a very young woman
[32:45] brother benham says and
[32:47] she's engaged to a man named joseph and
[32:49] and now
[32:50] she she's brother bam says she went to
[32:52] the well
[32:54] fetching some water amen and she's in
[32:56] the city of galilee
[32:58] named nazareth and in galilee a city
[33:01] named nazareth
[33:02] amen and he come to a virgin espouse to
[33:05] a man verse
[33:06] 27 whose name was joseph of the house of
[33:08] david and the virgin name was mary
[33:10] and the angel came in unto her and said
[33:12] hail thou art highly favored the lord is
[33:14] with thee blessed art thou among women
[33:17] now has that ever happened to you
[33:20] can you imagine the astonishment the
[33:22] shock the wonder
[33:24] look at the next verse and when she saw
[33:26] him
[33:27] she was troubled at his saying
[33:30] and cast in her mind what manner of
[33:32] salutation this should be
[33:35] and the angel said unto her fear not
[33:36] mary for thou has found favor with god
[33:39] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[33:41] womb and bring forth a sign and shalt
[33:43] call
[33:43] his name jesus he shall be great and
[33:47] shall be called the son of the highest
[33:49] and the lord god shall give unto him the
[33:51] throne of his father david
[33:53] and he shall reign over the house of
[33:54] jacob forever and of his kingdom
[33:56] there shall be no end then said mary
[33:59] unto the angel how shall this be seeing
[34:00] i know not a man
[34:02] and the angel answered and said unto her
[34:04] the holy ghost shall
[34:06] come upon thee and the power of the
[34:08] highest shall overshadow thee
[34:10] therefore also that holy thing which
[34:11] shall be born of thee shall be called
[34:13] the son of god
[34:15] and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath
[34:17] also conceived a son in her old age
[34:19] and this is the sixth month with her who
[34:21] was called barren
[34:23] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[34:25] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[34:27] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[34:30] and the angel departed from her
[34:33] so this is this is super interesting and
[34:36] i want to look at this
[34:37] first i want to go back and i want to
[34:38] look at the
[34:40] uh i want to look at verse 28 let's go
[34:43] verse 28 together
[34:45] and the angel came in unto her and said
[34:47] hail thou art highly
[34:48] favored this word highly favored amen
[34:52] in the greek it is i don't even know how
[34:55] to say these
[34:56] keritu i think but it says to be highly
[34:59] favored it's used twice one is
[35:00] interpreted to be highly favored
[35:02] the other is to make accepted to pursue
[35:05] with grace to compass with favor
[35:07] to honor with blessings so this is
[35:09] something god was doing to her
[35:11] not something she had done or earned
[35:15] highly favored the question is how did
[35:18] she get highly favored
[35:20] the bible doesn't say the bible gives us
[35:23] nothing that mary did
[35:24] it didn't say that she was upright in
[35:27] conduct
[35:27] it didn't say that she had lived
[35:29] virtuous we know she's a virgin but it
[35:31] didn't say
[35:32] you know that she where she had come
[35:33] from how many times a week she went to
[35:35] synagogue
[35:36] it didn't talk about her prayers and her
[35:38] fastings or her own giving
[35:39] amen there's no discussion on what mary
[35:42] did to put herself in this position
[35:44] amen it's nothing more than the
[35:46] declaration of the mind of god
[35:48] concerning her
[35:48] amen and he said thou art highly favored
[35:52] amen
[35:52] thou has been made accepted amen
[35:56] and he goes on they are highly favored
[35:59] the lord is
[36:00] with thee not the lord will come to you
[36:04] the lord is with thee now she hadn't
[36:08] conceived yet
[36:09] she had this event hadn't take place yet
[36:12] but still the lord was with her
[36:15] amen and and and do you think that the
[36:18] lord has not been with every seed
[36:20] amen that's been traveling through life
[36:22] amen do you think the lord wasn't with
[36:23] rahab rahab is living a life of
[36:25] prostitution and harlotry
[36:27] amen but the lord knows right where she
[36:29] is amen the lord's watching over her
[36:31] do you think rahab may not have had
[36:32] opportunity to die at some point but god
[36:35] preserved her life amen
[36:36] something would have happened maybe in
[36:37] her childhood something in her adulthood
[36:40] but god is saving her for a specific
[36:42] purpose because she's a predestinated
[36:44] womb to bring forth
[36:46] amen boaz nothing's going to happen to
[36:49] her the lord is watching over her
[36:51] and now mary comes to a position where
[36:53] there's an angel that says
[36:55] you're highly favored and the lord is
[36:58] with thee
[37:00] can you imagine mary looking around amen
[37:02] like so many of us do when we start
[37:04] thinking of natural things
[37:06] i haven't seen him i was here alone i've
[37:08] been walking alone for so long
[37:10] and the angel's saying you've met you've
[37:12] not recognized the presence of the lord
[37:16] the lord is with thee
[37:20] blessed art thou among women
[37:25] when she saw him she was troubled and is
[37:27] saying cast in her mind what manner of
[37:29] salutation it should be
[37:31] and the angel said unto her fear not
[37:32] mary for thou hast
[37:34] found favor with god
[37:37] this word favor in the bible is
[37:42] i don't know karis carey's c-h-a-r-i-s
[37:47] but it is interpreted a hundred and
[37:50] thirty times
[37:51] as grace
[37:54] a hundred thirty times in the new
[37:56] testament this words in type
[37:58] and interpreted grace and it's
[38:00] interpreted favor
[38:01] six times so let's look at this this
[38:03] again
[38:06] verse 30 and the angel said unto her
[38:08] fear not mary for thou has found
[38:10] grace with god
[38:13] and this word found i mean it's an
[38:15] interesting word found because
[38:17] the word found here in the greek
[38:21] it can it means to come upon to hit upon
[38:24] to meet with
[38:25] and it can mean after searching to find
[38:28] a thing sought
[38:30] or without previous searching defined by
[38:34] chance
[38:34] to fall in with so now
[38:38] there's a certain kind of found where
[38:41] you know
[38:41] i i've lost my pen you know and so i'm
[38:44] looking around
[38:45] i'm actively searching and i'm looking
[38:48] for a pen
[38:49] and when i find it hey i found my pen
[38:52] but there's another kind of found amen
[38:55] where without
[38:56] any searching amen you just come in
[38:58] contact with the thing
[39:00] without you searching without you
[39:02] looking you just meet with it you just
[39:03] come in contact with it and this is what
[39:05] happened to mary
[39:06] mary wasn't looking for this amen this
[39:09] came to her
[39:11] [Applause]
[39:13] how many of you were looking for the
[39:14] message of the hour when it came across
[39:16] your path
[39:17] how many of you were thinking oh god
[39:19] there needs to be a prophet in this day
[39:21] you're going to have a bride amen show
[39:24] me where this great
[39:25] prophet of malachi 4 is you weren't
[39:27] looking for it
[39:28] but grace found you
[39:32] you found grace with god you've come in
[39:35] contact with the grace
[39:37] when did the grace show up amen when you
[39:39] decided to believe the message
[39:42] no way when you made a decision that
[39:45] you're going to believe the word
[39:46] and all of a sudden grace was poured on
[39:48] you had grace from before the foundation
[39:50] of the world
[39:51] when your name was recorded in the
[39:52] lamb's book of life and sealed there
[39:54] amen grace was already amen it was
[39:57] already given to you
[40:00] there come a point when you found grace
[40:03] with god
[40:04] you came in contact you met with you
[40:06] stumbled upon
[40:09] god wasn't stumbling he knew just how to
[40:11] give it to you
[40:12] but for you it came as a surprise
[40:17] for you you weren't certain for you it
[40:19] was as if
[40:20] it was just by chance i met somebody at
[40:23] work and i had a friend and
[40:24] he gave me a tape and he gave me a book
[40:26] and he invited me to church
[40:28] it was just it just happened but with
[40:30] god it didn't just happen
[40:33] god's been watching for you amen
[40:37] hallelujah
[40:41] amen
[40:44] and so the angel goes on to describe
[40:46] that she's going to have a son
[40:48] and name's jesus he's going to be son of
[40:51] the highest
[40:52] have the throne of his father david
[40:54] verse 33 and he shall reign over the
[40:56] house of jacob forever and of his
[40:57] kingdom there shall be no end
[40:59] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[41:02] this be seeing i know not a man.
[41:05] now i want you to understand mary
[41:08] is not doubting that she's going to have
[41:11] a son
[41:14] and she's not doubting his name will be
[41:16] jesus she's not
[41:17] doubting he'll be the son of the most
[41:18] high she's not doubting that he'll sit
[41:20] on the throne of his father david
[41:22] she's just curious how it's going to
[41:24] work
[41:26] she never questioned what the angel said
[41:28] she wants to know how it's going to be
[41:32] there's so many things in life that you
[41:34] hear the prophet say amen you don't
[41:36] question that he said that and you're
[41:38] the one that's going to do it there's
[41:39] going to be a manifestation
[41:41] it's going to come through you the son
[41:42] of man minister in the bride but
[41:44] sometimes you're like
[41:45] how is it going to happen not that i'm
[41:48] doubting it i know it's going to happen
[41:50] but how's it going to happen mary didn't
[41:52] have a spirit of doubt upon her
[41:53] she was asking a question and because
[41:55] all she knows is natural things
[41:57] all she knows is a natural life amen and
[42:00] in a natural life
[42:01] it takes a man and a woman amen to bring
[42:03] forth a baby
[42:04] she's not questioning whether there's
[42:06] going to be a baby
[42:08] you realize that she's not doubting that
[42:10] there's not going to be a son
[42:11] she's not downing he won't be the son of
[42:13] the most high she's not doubting he'll
[42:15] take the throne of david
[42:16] she's asking how will it be
[42:20] so look at the angel
[42:25] and the angel answered and said unto her
[42:28] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[42:32] because he's been bound by chains and
[42:35] dogmas and denominational challenge
[42:37] chains for nearly two thousand years
[42:39] but he's going to be loosed in the
[42:40] evening time by the evening time
[42:42] messenger
[42:42] the holy ghost back on the people again
[42:47] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[42:50] and the power of the highest shall
[42:52] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[42:54] thing which shall be born and thee shall
[42:56] be called
[42:57] the son of god and behold thy cousin
[43:00] elizabeth
[43:02] she hath also conceived a son in her old
[43:04] age and this is the sixth month with her
[43:05] who is called barren
[43:07] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[43:09] and mary said
[43:11] behold the handmaid of the lord be it
[43:13] unto me according to thy word
[43:16] and the angel departed from her
[43:20] mary had never seen this happen before
[43:24] there is no example in the bible
[43:29] of a woman conceiving without a man
[43:33] but she believed it
[43:36] see mary is the fifth woman
[43:40] and mary is lady grace
[43:44] thou art highly favored thou hast found
[43:46] grace
[43:47] with god and brother bam says in the
[43:49] invisible union of the bride of christ
[43:51] in 1965
[43:52] man i add to this woman grace may i
[43:54] place her in the bible also
[43:57] is called the elect lady this misgrace
[44:00] i'm going to talk about
[44:01] no the bible declares now the bible
[44:03] declares
[44:04] to the elect lady that if you notice
[44:07] elect come from the word elected lady
[44:09] one lady amongst all other ladies was
[44:11] elected
[44:13] like the virgin was to bring forth the
[44:15] body of god on the earth
[44:17] she was an elected woman god chose mary
[44:20] mary didn't choose god we got to
[44:23] understand this
[44:24] mary was just going about her business
[44:27] mary was just doing what mary did mary
[44:30] didn't choose god
[44:31] mary you know no doubt mary had
[44:35] heard about the prophecy a virgin shall
[44:37] conceive
[44:38] and when she lives in israel she must
[44:39] have heard that out of isaiah chapter 7.
[44:42] she must have heard
[44:43] isaiah 9 and 6 a son is born she must
[44:45] have known those scriptures amen
[44:47] but she may have never dreamed in her
[44:50] wildest dreams
[44:51] that she would be the one to fulfill
[44:53] that scripture
[44:55] she wasn't looking for god to fulfill
[44:57] that in her
[44:58] she was just going about her business
[45:00] but she was ordained before the
[45:01] foundation of the world to be the womb
[45:04] that would bring forth christ
[45:08] she's walking misgrace one woman
[45:11] amongst all other women there's no woman
[45:14] like this
[45:14] and you can't earn this position
[45:18] i want to ask if there was any way amen
[45:20] if there was any way to earn the
[45:22] position the
[45:23] the girls in israel would be lining up
[45:24] amen running obstacle courses
[45:26] doing whatever kind of training they had
[45:28] to do or whatever kind of purification
[45:30] to take this privilege
[45:31] amen but there was not an earthly thing
[45:33] that could be done to be this woman
[45:37] no matter how hard you tried no matter
[45:38] how hard you fasted no matter how hard
[45:40] you prayed
[45:41] you could never take this scripture upon
[45:44] yourself
[45:47] it doesn't matter how much you see the
[45:48] need for it amen you can say we really
[45:50] need that deliverer now
[45:52] amen and i'm a virgin and i want it to
[45:54] happen i'm going to go on a
[45:56] 30-day fast i'm going to go on a 40-day
[45:58] fast i'm going to live
[46:00] pure and clean i'm not i'm going to go
[46:01] into a cave and i'm not going to come
[46:03] out
[46:05] there's nothing you can do to be this
[46:08] miss grace
[46:10] she's just living she's just walking
[46:13] she's just living
[46:14] a normal life amen and the angel comes
[46:17] to her
[46:18] to identify who she is to her because
[46:20] she doesn't know
[46:22] who she is she can read
[46:25] isaiah 7 the virgin a council conceived
[46:27] she doesn't know she's the virgin
[46:31] it's going to take an angel to identify
[46:33] who she is
[46:34] [Music]
[46:37] hallelujah and then the angel begins to
[46:40] tell her
[46:41] the the fulfillment of the scripture
[46:43] because to say
[46:44] have a son name jesus and she is this is
[46:47] it
[46:47] this is it amen and she's not asking
[46:50] she's not saying
[46:51] that's not possible it can't be jesus it
[46:54] can't be me
[46:55] she never says that friends
[46:58] all she says is wow now how is that
[47:01] going to happen
[47:05] hallelujah and the angel explains to her
[47:09] the holy ghost shall overshadow you
[47:14] brother braham goes on to say invisible
[47:16] union
[47:18] like the virgin was to bring forth the
[47:19] body of god on earth she was
[47:21] an elected woman god chose mary and also
[47:24] god has chosen an elected lady which is
[47:27] his bride
[47:28] she's elected i hope we're members of
[47:30] that tonight across the world across the
[47:32] nation rather
[47:33] the illustration here shows the
[47:34] relationship of the bride to christ the
[47:36] elect lady and how she was to be brought
[47:39] to him
[47:40] where she would come from and how that
[47:42] she would be brought to him the church
[47:43] here
[47:44] an illustration that we got in view is
[47:46] illustrated
[47:47] by a woman which a woman is always a
[47:49] type of the church because the church is
[47:51] considered a bride
[47:52] a bride she is the bride of the lord
[47:54] jesus the son of god
[47:56] and this bride amen is just as
[47:59] predestinated as
[48:00] mary was if you're in this bride
[48:04] you were every bit as predestinated as
[48:07] mary was
[48:09] and mary was predestinated okay so
[48:12] mary's the predestinated one
[48:14] she's the woman that's going to bring
[48:15] forth christ there's nobody else in the
[48:18] world there's nobody else past
[48:19] amen present or future there's no other
[48:22] hope for the salvation of the world but
[48:24] mary bringing forth
[48:26] you understand god doesn't change his
[48:28] predestinated will
[48:29] if mary wasn't the one he wasn't going
[48:31] to get another one
[48:32] she's the one and mary's walking along
[48:37] living her life
[48:38] and now she's been predestinated before
[48:40] the foundation of the world
[48:41] she's come from the mind of god but
[48:43] she's in spiritual amnesia
[48:44] she has no idea she came from the mind
[48:46] of god she has no idea
[48:48] she's the one to bring forth christ in
[48:49] her day she doesn't know
[48:51] she's just hoping to have a good
[48:53] marriage to joseph
[48:54] raise some babies have a nice family
[48:56] live a life without a bunch of sickness
[48:58] and hardship and die someday
[49:01] she's not planning on being the virgin
[49:04] she's not hoping to be the one
[49:06] she's just living life
[49:09] so it's not mary's responsibility
[49:12] to come in contact with the angel
[49:16] it's not mary's responsibility to
[49:19] conceive
[49:21] what can she do mary's not responsible
[49:25] to bring forth
[49:26] for bringing forth the word mary's not
[49:29] responsible to bring forth the word of
[49:31] god
[49:32] amen marries the chosen one all she's
[49:34] doing is walking and at some point
[49:36] it's god's responsibility to meet her to
[49:39] with
[49:39] an angel and an angel to identify to her
[49:42] who she
[49:43] is amen and then there's a c gene of
[49:45] eternal life down in there that's going
[49:47] to say
[49:48] be it unto me according to your word
[49:53] see just like this day there's an elect
[49:56] lady to be the bride of jesus
[49:58] christ amen we've many of us just lived
[50:00] our life
[50:01] just did our thing had no hope
[50:04] no desire no thought of being that elect
[50:07] lady
[50:07] but we were just as predestinated as
[50:09] mary and it wasn't our responsibility
[50:12] to find the message of the hour it was
[50:14] god's responsibility to bring an
[50:15] angel into our path to identify who we
[50:18] are in the day we're living in and what
[50:20] scriptures were to manifest
[50:24] amen it's not our job to question it you
[50:27] may say
[50:28] wow that's amazing i can't see how that
[50:30] would work but i believe it
[50:33] we finally say just just we come to
[50:36] terms with the fact
[50:37] i may never understand how it's going to
[50:40] work mechanically
[50:41] i may never understand how it's going to
[50:43] work naturally with physics and
[50:45] chemistry and all this but i can say be
[50:47] it unto me according to your word
[50:50] amen amen and amen
[50:54] now brother brahm says in the message of
[50:57] grace
[50:58] 1961 he said think of it love and grace
[51:01] is sisters twin sisters
[51:04] you can't have grace without having love
[51:07] why because he extends grace to whom
[51:09] he's already loved
[51:10] and how do you know his love his love is
[51:12] elected
[51:13] love god's love is elective love
[51:17] who he's chose before the foundation of
[51:19] the world
[51:20] amen you can't have grace without having
[51:23] love they're twin sisters they're
[51:24] exactly right
[51:25] before you can have grace you have to
[51:27] have love before you can actually show
[51:30] somebody a favor
[51:31] you love them right or wrong you have to
[51:33] love them anyhow
[51:35] or you can't that means mary was
[51:38] loved before she met the angel
[51:43] that means mary was the was the object
[51:45] of god's love
[51:46] before she said be it unto me
[51:50] before she responded to the word amen he
[51:53] can never
[51:54] say amen that you found favor you found
[51:56] grace he can never say
[51:58] that you're highly favored that grace is
[52:00] put upon you he can't say that unless
[52:02] love is already extended to her
[52:06] so you were the object of god's love
[52:08] before you believed his word
[52:10] [Music]
[52:13] hallelujah i love it before you can
[52:18] show somebody a favor you love them
[52:20] right or wrong you have to love them
[52:22] anyhow or you can't see
[52:23] so love and grace is the same thing
[52:26] they're just twin sisters that's all
[52:28] love and grace we can't see one without
[52:31] the others
[52:31] god so loved the world he gave his only
[52:33] begotten son he shed his grace abroad in
[52:35] our hearts through the holy ghost see
[52:36] there's just nothing you can do without
[52:38] working one with the other
[52:39] grace grace of god this is what saves us
[52:43] and so mary is lady grace
[52:47] i want to i want to look at something in
[52:49] the in the life of brother branham
[52:50] if we go back to the to february of 1962
[52:55] we know the seals are going to be open
[52:56] in march of 1963 he's going to preach
[52:59] the seal series but a year before that
[53:01] in 1962 he's preaching february 4th
[53:04] right in the beginning
[53:05] of february so right along this time of
[53:09] the year
[53:10] he's preaching in a message titled
[53:12] communion
[53:14] he says we see that the astronomers are
[53:16] predicting sometime in this early part
[53:18] of the first part of the month
[53:19] beginning on the second or the fifth or
[53:21] somewhere along this month
[53:23] the indian astronomers predict the world
[53:25] to blow to pieces
[53:26] and the american newspapers make fun of
[53:29] it i do not believe the world's going to
[53:31] blow to pieces but i do say it's wrong
[53:33] to make fun of it
[53:36] so here's brother branham and what he's
[53:38] referring to is there's newspaper
[53:39] articles out that there's going to be an
[53:41] alignment
[53:42] of five planets something that brother
[53:45] man's gonna say hadn't happened for like
[53:46] 25 000 years or something like that
[53:48] amen and there's indian astronomers
[53:50] saying the world's going to blow up
[53:52] there's a prediction
[53:53] or something like that amen and he says
[53:55] the american papers are making fun of it
[53:57] he says now i don't believe the world's
[53:58] going to blow up
[53:59] but i think it's wrong to make fun of it
[54:03] amen then he goes on to say
[54:08] because some things fixing to happen one
[54:11] of these days
[54:12] something similar to that when the five
[54:14] planets mars jupiter venus and so forth
[54:16] comes into their
[54:18] they never have did it oh they claimed
[54:20] maybe 25 000 years ago but who was back
[54:22] there to know it
[54:24] i predict that this is a spiritual
[54:27] application
[54:29] 1962 early february i predict this as a
[54:33] spiritual application
[54:36] i believe it's the coming in of the
[54:38] issue of god
[54:40] that the great revelations of the word
[54:42] will be opened during this time
[54:45] this is before sirs is this the time
[54:48] this is before the visions this is
[54:49] before
[54:50] all of this happens that sends him out
[54:52] west amen to see a visitation of seven
[54:54] angels
[54:55] before any of that that happens in
[54:57] december
[54:58] here we are in february of that year
[55:00] before that
[55:01] he's already looking at an alignment of
[55:03] five planets and he's saying it has a
[55:05] spiritual application
[55:06] and it's the issue of god the great
[55:08] revelations of the word will be
[55:10] open during this time he's exactly
[55:14] right
[55:17] remember they claim it was three stars
[55:19] come in their orbits when jesus was born
[55:21] and this is five and five is grace the
[55:24] number of grace
[55:25] three is the number of perfection five
[55:27] is the number of grace
[55:29] jesus j-e-s-u-s five grace g-r-a-c-e
[55:34] faith f-a-i-t-h so forth number of grace
[55:37] god never sends his power to the church
[55:39] it'll be his
[55:41] god ever sends his power to the church
[55:43] it'll be his grace it won't be the
[55:45] obedience of the people
[55:49] so god is showing an alignment of five
[55:51] planets in the heavens and is making the
[55:53] newspapers
[55:54] and there's predictions and all of that
[55:56] that's why amen friends we've got
[55:58] we've got all kinds of signs in the
[56:00] heavens going on we've got blood
[56:02] moons and this and eclipses and all of
[56:03] that and you rest assured there's a
[56:05] spiritual application
[56:07] don't make fun of it but don't you go
[56:09] probing either because you're not a
[56:11] prophet
[56:13] without a prophet you're going to have
[56:14] all kinds of chaos and
[56:16] theories and all of this going on and
[56:17] all we're going to do is just hurt the
[56:19] cause of christ
[56:20] all we can say is there's a spiritual
[56:22] application god shows it in the heavens
[56:24] first before he declares it on earth
[56:26] it's got a spiritual application things
[56:28] are happening and things are happening
[56:29] in the heavenly bodies all the time
[56:31] it's making the news all the time and i
[56:33] don't understand
[56:36] because when i was growing up amen in
[56:38] the last few years it didn't seem like
[56:40] all these astronomical events
[56:41] had so much impact on the news
[56:45] i don't know if some of you watched more
[56:46] news than me over the last 30 or 40
[56:48] years
[56:49] but it seems like all of a sudden it's
[56:50] like constantly there's
[56:52] an eclipse there's a blood moon there's
[56:54] a super wolf blood moon there's a blah
[56:55] blah blah blah blah
[56:58] because spiritual things are taking
[57:00] place
[57:01] that's all we can say spiritual things
[57:04] are taking place on the earth
[57:05] i can't tell you what they are and this
[57:07] one means that and this one lies that
[57:08] i can't tell you that all i can tell you
[57:10] spiritual things are taking place
[57:12] on the earth and they're taking place
[57:14] quickly
[57:17] we go from one astronomical event to
[57:19] another to another to another
[57:20] that means this bride must be moving
[57:22] into position that means
[57:24] israel must be moving into position that
[57:25] means things are lining up quickly
[57:29] hallelujah he says now grace
[57:36] god ever sends his power to the church
[57:38] it'll be his grace
[57:39] it won't be the obedience of the people
[57:44] i want to ask you a question who lined
[57:47] those five planets up
[57:50] and how long ago were they set in a
[57:53] cycle that would bring them to an
[57:55] alignment
[57:58] millions i don't know billions i don't
[58:00] know how many years
[58:03] so many years ago when god set the
[58:06] heavenly bodies in their place and began
[58:08] to move them into the heavenly dance
[58:10] where they would move about
[58:11] amen in a certain time all the way back
[58:14] whenever he did that
[58:17] he knew that in 1962 that there was
[58:20] going to be five planets that would line
[58:22] up
[58:23] because now it was time for something to
[58:26] take place on the earth
[58:29] do you think things are just happening
[58:30] and you're in my life you think that
[58:32] these are accidents and random events
[58:34] and
[58:34] wow that was odd that that happened to
[58:36] me things have been ordained
[58:38] from before the foundation of the world
[58:40] are beginning to take place
[58:45] it won't be it'll be his grace it won't
[58:48] be the obedience of the people
[58:51] now think about this back
[58:55] when god lined up three stars brother
[58:58] brenham said to look like one for the
[58:59] magi
[59:00] to see it's the three offices of god
[59:02] coming into one amen
[59:04] into jesus christ and he said that all
[59:06] the way back however long ago he put
[59:08] them in orbit they lined up
[59:10] how did he know that mary would believe
[59:16] how did he know there would be a virgin
[59:18] on earth that would believe
[59:20] amen her position was secured before the
[59:23] stars were put in place
[59:27] her position her works what she's
[59:29] ordained to
[59:30] was placed in his book before the stars
[59:34] were placed in the sky
[59:38] that's why it has to be by grace amen it
[59:41] can't be dependent on your works
[59:42] because he's already ordained it so he's
[59:44] already said it would be so it's already
[59:46] taken place in his mind he's already
[59:48] placed it in the heavenly bodies
[59:49] and he's not going to change it just
[59:51] because you've lived like a harlot
[59:55] in jericho for so many years he's not
[59:57] going to change it just because italy
[59:59] malek left the land amen and naomi went
[1:00:01] destitute and the sons marry a moabite
[1:00:03] woman and they got to come back for
[1:00:05] he's not changing his plan because of
[1:00:07] the circumstances he's not waiting
[1:00:10] to see what you will do to see if he
[1:00:12] will work his plan
[1:00:13] he has already worked his plan the
[1:00:15] heavenly bodies are already set
[1:00:17] and the scripture says he declares it in
[1:00:18] heaven before he does earth and the
[1:00:20] heavens have been set
[1:00:24] how long have the heavens been set in
[1:00:26] fixed position
[1:00:28] and timing of rotation it's already said
[1:00:30] it's already done in the mind of god
[1:00:32] and you're here fleshing out what has
[1:00:34] already been said
[1:00:38] it's by his grace not by the obedience
[1:00:41] of the people
[1:00:43] if he had to wait for us he would have
[1:00:45] had to wait
[1:00:46] until after you're born
[1:00:50] let's put it this way he would have to
[1:00:52] wait till after mary was born
[1:00:54] to see what kind of girl mary was to see
[1:00:57] if she was suitable
[1:00:59] and then create some stars
[1:01:04] amen oh i hope i don't miss the rapture
[1:01:08] are you kidding me
[1:01:12] don't ever say that again
[1:01:16] if you have the possibility of missing
[1:01:19] the rapture you are guaranteed to miss
[1:01:21] the rapture
[1:01:25] if it is possible for you to miss the
[1:01:27] rapture then you're guaranteed to miss
[1:01:30] the rapture
[1:01:32] do you think god's going to wait and
[1:01:33] decide who he's going to rapture and
[1:01:35] wait and see
[1:01:36] okay yeah they've done pretty good check
[1:01:37] they're in the he already knows who's
[1:01:39] going to take that heavenly flight and
[1:01:41] the body
[1:01:41] he already knows who's going to slip
[1:01:43] dimensions in the translation of the
[1:01:44] body
[1:01:45] it's already fixed you're not going to
[1:01:48] miss the rapture
[1:01:50] if you're a child of god a sieging of
[1:01:52] god that was in his mind before the
[1:01:54] foundation of the world
[1:01:55] you will not miss the rapture
[1:01:58] that's a scare tactic of the devil
[1:02:00] that's a scarecrow
[1:02:03] when the devil comes with that you just
[1:02:05] say boo devil
[1:02:08] you fell in sin you had an evil thought
[1:02:10] you said something you told a lie and
[1:02:12] when you were under pressure
[1:02:13] maybe you'll miss the rapture the
[1:02:15] rapture me making the rapture wasn't
[1:02:16] dependent on me never lying
[1:02:21] meeking the rapture was not dependent on
[1:02:22] my obedience making the rapture was his
[1:02:25] grace amen that come from his love
[1:02:27] amen that was extended when he wrote the
[1:02:29] book
[1:02:30] [Applause]
[1:02:33] hallelujah how could mary miss it she
[1:02:37] couldn't miss it it came to her
[1:02:39] how could she not believe it she had
[1:02:40] something inside her to believe it with
[1:02:42] all the ingredients were present the
[1:02:44] heavenly bodies were moving
[1:02:46] and she was moving under the influence
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:50] it was wrote in god's mind amen it was
[1:02:53] wrote in the heavenly bodies
[1:02:54] it was wrote in the pyramid it was wrote
[1:02:56] in the bible and now
[1:02:58] it's being written upon the earth in
[1:02:59] mary's life and they all
[1:03:02] have to match there's going to be no
[1:03:04] discrepancy
[1:03:08] hallelujah still in the same message
[1:03:12] february 1962. 5's number of grace
[1:03:18] it'll be his grace it won't be the
[1:03:19] obedience of the people and isaiah said
[1:03:21] in the 40th chapter
[1:03:23] how to cry to jerusalem that her warfare
[1:03:26] was over
[1:03:27] yet she was guilty of idolatry but it
[1:03:29] was god's grace that was sending him
[1:03:31] god sends anything to us it'll be his
[1:03:33] grace and not
[1:03:34] our merits so it may mean something i
[1:03:39] predict that there'll be a change
[1:03:41] i don't know what it'll be but i believe
[1:03:43] it's fixing to happen
[1:03:45] we're we're right on the eve of it now
[1:03:49] so brother venom is a prophet in the
[1:03:51] land he's seeing the alignment of stars
[1:03:53] he's saying five is grace something's
[1:03:55] grace something's happened
[1:03:56] the issue of god is coming forth the
[1:03:58] word's being restored in this day
[1:04:00] it won't be by your merits to be by his
[1:04:02] grace i believe it's happening don't
[1:04:03] know what it is
[1:04:05] but it's fixing to happen we're right on
[1:04:06] the eve of it now
[1:04:09] praise god
[1:04:13] let's go to romans chapter 11. i just
[1:04:15] want to lay down
[1:04:17] this grace real tight here
[1:04:22] romans chapter 11.
[1:04:34] romans chapter 11 verse 5.
[1:04:40] even so then at this present time also
[1:04:42] there is a remnant according to the
[1:04:44] election
[1:04:45] of grace he's talking about the jews the
[1:04:47] jews didn't believe christ but even yet
[1:04:49] in their unbelief there's a there's an
[1:04:51] election
[1:04:52] according to grace there's a remnant
[1:04:54] according to the election of grace
[1:04:56] and if by grace then it is no more of
[1:04:58] works otherwise grace is no more
[1:05:00] grace but if it be of works then is it
[1:05:04] no more grace
[1:05:05] otherwise work is no more work
[1:05:08] what then israel has not obtained what
[1:05:10] they seek for
[1:05:11] but the election hath obtained it and
[1:05:14] the rest
[1:05:15] were blinded i see the message
[1:05:19] i see the light i'm walking in the light
[1:05:21] why
[1:05:22] because of grace not because of
[1:05:25] merit we couldn't do anything to earn it
[1:05:27] there's no way
[1:05:29] so brother branham 62
[1:05:32] february 4th in the communion message
[1:05:35] he's talking about these stars
[1:05:37] then he comes the next month in march
[1:05:39] march 18th he preaches a a very pivotal
[1:05:42] very powerful message he preaches the
[1:05:44] spoken word
[1:05:45] is the original seed so what he reads
[1:05:49] yeah spoken word of the original seed
[1:05:51] and he says there's been three seeds
[1:05:52] planted
[1:05:53] he says there's been the evangelical
[1:05:55] seed plan and the pentecostal seed's
[1:05:57] been planted
[1:05:57] and he says and the word's been planted
[1:06:00] now the planting is done
[1:06:01] now watch what comes forth
[1:06:05] he's talking about the diminishing of
[1:06:06] the revival meetings the diminishing of
[1:06:08] the healing means and he's saying
[1:06:09] that was just there to get the seed sown
[1:06:11] there's been three seeds now
[1:06:13] watch amen watch what these seeds bring
[1:06:15] forth they're going to begin to bring
[1:06:17] forth
[1:06:18] a harvest of what's been planted so now
[1:06:21] he comes the next day
[1:06:22] after that message which is march 19
[1:06:26] 1962
[1:06:27] and he preaches a message called the end
[1:06:29] time
[1:06:30] sign seed next day
[1:06:34] he said three is the number of
[1:06:36] perfection we all know that three is
[1:06:37] god's
[1:06:38] number in his numerology god is known by
[1:06:41] his numbers three is perfection seven is
[1:06:43] worship 24 is worship
[1:06:44] 40 is temptation 50 is pentecost jubilee
[1:06:47] so forth
[1:06:48] all of his numbers his numerals of god
[1:06:50] is perfected is in perfection
[1:06:52] now three is the number of perfection
[1:06:54] just before now listen
[1:06:55] now close when the little baby christ
[1:06:58] was born three stars went together
[1:07:00] and made the one morning star that
[1:07:02] reflected the coming of an
[1:07:04] infant christ a perfect one now
[1:07:07] what's happened so he points back to
[1:07:09] when christ was born
[1:07:10] when the infant baby christ was born
[1:07:12] there was a lineman of three stars
[1:07:14] now what's happened we see a roar in the
[1:07:17] paper across the
[1:07:18] television out across a nation where
[1:07:21] five stars just fell in line with the
[1:07:23] world
[1:07:24] what's five a number of grace every time
[1:07:26] those stars come
[1:07:28] then something happens on earth what
[1:07:30] taken place five stars fell in
[1:07:32] what is it an introduction of what when
[1:07:35] three came together
[1:07:36] introduced introduced baby christ now
[1:07:39] five has come together the number of
[1:07:41] grace they've lined up
[1:07:42] what it's introducing what that's his
[1:07:44] question what's being introduced
[1:07:47] since then just look what's taken place
[1:07:50] germany almost washed off the map
[1:07:52] some of the magi said that the world
[1:07:53] would burst like a watermelon
[1:07:55] every distressful things prophesied by
[1:07:57] them for the last days
[1:07:58] look what's taken place england the
[1:08:00] other day had a storm that blowed away
[1:08:01] 70 thousand houses one day
[1:08:04] disasters everywhere california los
[1:08:06] angeles like to wash into the ocean
[1:08:08] what is it beginning of sorrows
[1:08:12] i thought this was grace number five
[1:08:14] going together grace
[1:08:16] but now all these natural disasters are
[1:08:17] happening under the line and the stars
[1:08:19] he says the beginning of sorrows
[1:08:22] earthquakes is picked up everywhere
[1:08:24] why is it so he starts showing all the
[1:08:27] natural
[1:08:27] how the earth is responding to these
[1:08:29] five stars lining up
[1:08:31] and he says what is it five stars come
[1:08:34] in line
[1:08:35] grace god's grace
[1:08:39] what's happened an infant church
[1:08:43] a bride infancy that the power of god
[1:08:46] has begun to fall on her
[1:08:47] she's taking form a bride for the
[1:08:50] bridegroom
[1:08:52] so here brother branham in february 62
[1:08:54] is reading the newspaper seeing the
[1:08:55] alignment of stars
[1:08:56] hearing what the magi are saying and
[1:08:58] he's saying i believe he has a spiritual
[1:09:00] application i believe the word's coming
[1:09:02] forth now
[1:09:02] amen don't know what's happening but
[1:09:04] we're right on the eve of it he comes to
[1:09:06] march 18th 1962 a month later
[1:09:09] and he speaks preachers spoken where's
[1:09:11] the original seed he says now look the
[1:09:12] seeds are planted now watch what comes
[1:09:14] forth
[1:09:15] the next day in time sign seas he goes
[1:09:18] back to the five stars which a month
[1:09:20] earlier he said
[1:09:20] he couldn't determine exactly what it
[1:09:22] was but now after spoken word is the
[1:09:24] original seed
[1:09:25] he comes and said what is the five stars
[1:09:28] announcing what is it
[1:09:29] an infant church a bride coming forth
[1:09:36] and you think you can mess up this plan
[1:09:40] and you think that sometimes how we can
[1:09:42] derail
[1:09:44] the stars have the planets have lined up
[1:09:48] to bring it forth
[1:09:53] an infant church a bride infancy
[1:09:57] that the power of god has begun to fall
[1:09:59] on her she's taking form a bride
[1:10:02] for this brideground that three stars
[1:10:05] meant
[1:10:05] his perfection of the heavenly father of
[1:10:08] the trinity becoming one on earth among
[1:10:09] us
[1:10:10] god's office is becoming one office what
[1:10:12] happened now
[1:10:13] it's the church of the living god coming
[1:10:15] together under the word of god
[1:10:17] and the astronomic heaven is announcing
[1:10:19] her approach amen
[1:10:20] might not believe that but it's the word
[1:10:23] just the same
[1:10:26] what are you going to do with that you
[1:10:28] might not believe that but that's the
[1:10:29] word
[1:10:30] just the same brother benjamin is
[1:10:34] announcing and all
[1:10:35] heaven is moving at this announcement
[1:10:37] that an infant church of bride is coming
[1:10:39] forth a bride for his bridegroom
[1:10:40] it's announcing the approach of it now
[1:10:44] brother branham comes into the message
[1:10:46] uh in the church age book
[1:10:47] in pergamon church age he says the
[1:10:49] second son jesus also a spoken
[1:10:52] seed word of god was given a bride like
[1:10:54] was adam
[1:10:55] but before he could marry her she also
[1:10:57] had fallen she like adam's wife was put
[1:11:00] to the test
[1:11:00] whether she would believe the word of
[1:11:02] god and live or doubt the word and die
[1:11:04] she doubted she left the word she died
[1:11:08] from a little group of the true seed of
[1:11:09] the word god will present christ with a
[1:11:11] beloved
[1:11:12] bride she's a virgin of his word she's a
[1:11:15] virgin because she knows no man made
[1:11:16] creeds or dogmas
[1:11:18] by and through the members of the bride
[1:11:20] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:11:21] of god to be made manifest in the virgin
[1:11:25] whatever was promised before is going to
[1:11:28] happen now
[1:11:30] the word of promise came to the virgin
[1:11:32] mary but the word of promise was he
[1:11:35] himself to be made manifest
[1:11:39] so mary didn't just get a word
[1:11:44] the promised word came to mary through
[1:11:46] an angel but that promised word wasn't
[1:11:48] just a word
[1:11:49] it wasn't so mary could write a book
[1:11:50] about it amen and write down
[1:11:52] what the messenger had told her amen and
[1:11:54] go around and keep saying the messenger
[1:11:56] said this the messenger said this the
[1:11:57] messenger said
[1:11:58] that's not why it came
[1:12:01] the word came to her but the word of
[1:12:03] promise was
[1:12:04] he himself
[1:12:08] to be made manifest amen the word of
[1:12:10] promises come to the bride in this day
[1:12:12] not amen through an announcement of an
[1:12:15] angel so that we can make a book and so
[1:12:16] we could write the book and mary could
[1:12:18] go around with a book say look what the
[1:12:20] angel said look what the angel said look
[1:12:21] what the angel said
[1:12:22] that's not why the angel brought a
[1:12:24] message amen the word that came to mary
[1:12:27] was he himself to be made manifest
[1:12:30] and how was he himself to be made
[1:12:33] manifest
[1:12:34] the only way was to come into the virgin
[1:12:37] bride
[1:12:40] what do you think's taking place today
[1:12:42] friends amen it's not just so he can
[1:12:44] have a book
[1:12:44] it's so that he himself can be made
[1:12:48] manifest
[1:12:53] the word of promise came to the virgin
[1:12:54] mary but the word of promise was he
[1:12:57] himself to be made manifest
[1:13:01] god was made manifest he himself acted
[1:13:04] at that time and fulfilled his own word
[1:13:05] of promise
[1:13:06] in the virgin what did the virgin do
[1:13:10] nothing she surrendered
[1:13:14] she just accepted she just yielded
[1:13:16] herself
[1:13:17] she allowed him to have preeminence in
[1:13:19] her body that's all she did
[1:13:22] he did it himself
[1:13:25] he acted at that time and fulfilled his
[1:13:27] own word of promise in the virgin
[1:13:29] it was an angel that had brought her the
[1:13:31] message but the angel's message was the
[1:13:33] word of god
[1:13:34] isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time all
[1:13:37] that was written of him because
[1:13:39] because because
[1:13:43] she accepted his word to her
[1:13:46] what are you going to have to do to make
[1:13:47] all this come to pass
[1:13:50] just accept his word just believe it
[1:13:53] just say i surrender all just say i give
[1:13:56] you my life
[1:13:56] i believe it i believe it and here i am
[1:14:00] there's nothing else you can do he
[1:14:01] himself will manifest himself
[1:14:03] he himself will bring his word to pass
[1:14:05] he's the one who lined up the stars
[1:14:07] he's the one who sent the messenger he's
[1:14:09] the one who brought you on earth in this
[1:14:10] day
[1:14:11] he's done it all there's nothing for you
[1:14:13] to do except
[1:14:14] accept what he said believe it and say
[1:14:17] here i am be it
[1:14:18] unto me according to your word
[1:14:21] not according to my will not according
[1:14:23] to my idea but be it unto me according
[1:14:25] to your word
[1:14:31] let's go to luke luke chapter one
[1:14:36] after this event takes place mary takes
[1:14:39] off and goes looking for elizabeth
[1:14:42] her cousin we come to verse 39
[1:14:46] luke chapter 1 verse 39 and mary arose
[1:14:49] in those days and went into the hill
[1:14:50] country with haste into the city of
[1:14:52] judah
[1:14:52] and entered into the house of zacharias
[1:14:55] and saluted elizabeth
[1:14:56] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[1:14:58] heard the salutation of mary
[1:15:00] the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:15:02] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[1:15:05] look at the ministry of the virgin
[1:15:11] now within her is the seed of life
[1:15:16] it's it it's alive in her image she's
[1:15:19] conceived and she runs and she greets
[1:15:21] elizabeth and all she does is bring a
[1:15:23] salutation and
[1:15:24] she brings a salutation brother branham
[1:15:26] said the baby within elizabeth's womb
[1:15:29] was dead had never moved before
[1:15:32] but when she heard the salutation the
[1:15:34] baby leaped for joy
[1:15:38] and elizabeth was filled with the holy
[1:15:39] ghost and began to prophesy
[1:15:42] what did mary do she just showed up
[1:15:46] there's a power working in her life
[1:15:48] there's an anointing that's upon her
[1:15:50] and it's bringing life to a baby that
[1:15:53] would be stillborn
[1:15:54] it's bringing an anointing on elizabeth
[1:15:57] things are moving
[1:15:58] why all she did was accept the word
[1:16:04] hallelujah elizabeth
[1:16:07] heard the salutation of mary the babe
[1:16:08] leaped in her womb and elizabeth was
[1:16:10] filled with the holy ghost
[1:16:11] and she spoke out in a loud voice and
[1:16:13] said blessed art thou among women
[1:16:15] and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and
[1:16:18] whence is this when says this to me that
[1:16:21] the mother of my lord shall come to me
[1:16:23] or lo as soon as the voice of thy
[1:16:25] salutation sounded in my ears
[1:16:27] the babe leaped in my womb for joy and
[1:16:30] blessed is she that believeth
[1:16:32] blessed is she that believed for there
[1:16:35] shall be a performance of those things
[1:16:37] which were told her from the lord
[1:16:40] see even elizabeth recognizes she says
[1:16:44] blessed is she that believed
[1:16:49] there was nothing else that she could do
[1:16:51] but believe
[1:16:53] believe the angel's message believe the
[1:16:55] true report
[1:16:56] all she could do believe it and when she
[1:16:58] believed it she said
[1:16:59] for there shall be a performance of
[1:17:02] those things which were told her
[1:17:04] from the lord how am i going to live
[1:17:07] this kind of life how
[1:17:08] are we going to do these things just
[1:17:10] believe it
[1:17:12] and if you believe it there will be a
[1:17:14] performance of those things that were
[1:17:16] told you of the lord
[1:17:18] how am i going to have the power of the
[1:17:20] spoken word how am i
[1:17:21] going to do this and that i don't know
[1:17:23] how you're going to do it just believe
[1:17:24] it
[1:17:26] and it'll be performed just believe it
[1:17:28] and it'll come to pass
[1:17:30] just accept it and it'll happen
[1:17:38] brother bram said and from that time
[1:17:40] 1961
[1:17:41] mary the little virgin never had a woman
[1:17:43] bore a child without being
[1:17:45] intercourse with man never had she been
[1:17:47] able to ever be able to have a child
[1:17:49] without natural pollen
[1:17:50] but she believed god and before she felt
[1:17:53] any life or
[1:17:54] any or anything else the angel's words
[1:17:57] was good
[1:17:58] enough for her she met the lord said
[1:18:00] hail mary blessed out there among women
[1:18:02] you're going to have a child knowing no
[1:18:04] man she said behold the handmaid of the
[1:18:06] lord and from that time
[1:18:08] mary never waited till she was positive
[1:18:12] hallelujah mary didn't wait for a sign
[1:18:15] mary didn't wait amen until she saw
[1:18:17] miraculous healings to believe that she
[1:18:19] was the bride
[1:18:21] mary didn't wait to believe this word
[1:18:23] was true until she got a bunch of signs
[1:18:25] and a positive confirmation
[1:18:27] she didn't wait till she began to show
[1:18:28] she didn't wait till she felt something
[1:18:30] kick inside of her
[1:18:31] before there was one evidence before
[1:18:34] anything
[1:18:34] in her physical body changed she
[1:18:37] confessed
[1:18:38] amen what the angel had told her and she
[1:18:40] believed it amen and it was taking place
[1:18:42] in her life
[1:18:45] there's so many things that are
[1:18:46] happening now amen and so many things
[1:18:48] that we believe and we know there's
[1:18:49] things that are going to happen yet
[1:18:51] and how is it going to happen well when
[1:18:52] i start to see it tighten up i'll
[1:18:54] believe
[1:18:55] you'll never believe then when i start
[1:18:58] to see the power of the spoken word in
[1:19:00] the bride
[1:19:00] you're not going to believe then amen
[1:19:02] but the real believer believes
[1:19:04] now the real believer believes before he
[1:19:06] sees one sign
[1:19:07] one thing changed one positive
[1:19:09] confirmation amen of what he holds in
[1:19:11] his heart
[1:19:12] just because the angel said it is enough
[1:19:15] for me
[1:19:16] [Applause]
[1:19:18] why she's the ordained one to receive it
[1:19:21] amen
[1:19:22] she's the only one on earth to receive
[1:19:25] it
[1:19:25] she doesn't have to work her way up to
[1:19:27] it she doesn't have to try hard
[1:19:29] she's ordained to believe
[1:19:34] without seeing the bride
[1:19:37] the real true bride is not the one
[1:19:39] that's holding on and hanging around
[1:19:41] with the believers
[1:19:42] waiting to see what things happen and
[1:19:43] when i start to see even nobody's saying
[1:19:45] this out loud but they're thinking it in
[1:19:47] their mind
[1:19:48] it's something in their heart there's a
[1:19:49] doubt you know we'll start to see and
[1:19:51] there's going to be a tightening up yeah
[1:19:52] there's going to be a tightening up and
[1:19:54] when we see the government start passing
[1:19:55] yeah
[1:19:56] governments start passing laws and then
[1:19:57] we'll see a manifestation
[1:19:59] the full power of jesus christ on
[1:20:00] display when we begin to see that
[1:20:04] that's not the believers
[1:20:07] the believer says if i don't see it for
[1:20:09] 30 more years
[1:20:11] if i don't see it for 40 more years i
[1:20:13] believe it anyhow
[1:20:14] because the angel of the lord told me
[1:20:16] and he showed me out of the scriptures
[1:20:17] and i believe it
[1:20:21] hallelujah
[1:20:25] hallelujah praise be to god
[1:20:34] there's an interesting story that takes
[1:20:36] place in judges
[1:20:37] i believe chapter six i'm not going to
[1:20:39] take the time to go there we might
[1:20:40] minister on some other time but
[1:20:42] but there's a man named gideon remember
[1:20:45] now five is the number of grace now
[1:20:46] there's a man named gideon
[1:20:48] who's going to be the fifth judge of
[1:20:49] israel
[1:20:51] and and they're in a time when the
[1:20:53] midianites
[1:20:54] now are oppressing them and the
[1:20:56] midianites and the malachites are taking
[1:20:57] all they have
[1:20:58] and he finds himself threshing out wheat
[1:21:01] and hiding it by the wine press to keep
[1:21:03] it from the midianites
[1:21:04] amen every time they would have a
[1:21:06] harvest and every time they would they
[1:21:07] would harvest the seed
[1:21:08] they would rush in and they would steal
[1:21:10] what they had and leave them just enough
[1:21:11] to survive to create more crops
[1:21:14] and so now he's in this situation where
[1:21:16] he's hiding out he's stretching out
[1:21:18] wheat
[1:21:18] just to have enough to hide away from
[1:21:20] the midianites there's no
[1:21:21] thought in his mind of defeating the
[1:21:23] midian knights he's hiding his wheat
[1:21:25] from the midian knight
[1:21:26] he's confident they're coming to take it
[1:21:29] you see where gideon's at he's not he's
[1:21:32] not saying
[1:21:33] i'm not hiding it i'm bold as a lion
[1:21:35] they're not going to take my wheat
[1:21:37] no he's sure they're going to take his
[1:21:38] wheat he's confident they're coming
[1:21:41] again he's confident they're going to
[1:21:42] have more power than him so he's got to
[1:21:44] hide it
[1:21:48] then an angel comes to him
[1:21:51] says thou gideon mighty man of valor
[1:22:03] you know we know gideon
[1:22:07] you know i don't suppose he looked over
[1:22:09] his shoulder because he was hiding he
[1:22:10] was probably doing this secretly
[1:22:12] but the angel says gideon thou mighty
[1:22:14] men of valor
[1:22:15] and all of a sudden gideon's like
[1:22:18] excuse me what did you say he doesn't
[1:22:24] feel like a mighty man of valor
[1:22:27] here's a man who's oppressed by enemies
[1:22:28] who's hiding enough wheat to survive for
[1:22:30] the next year because they're going to
[1:22:32] come and take it from him because he's
[1:22:33] not strong enough to defend himself
[1:22:36] how gideon mighty man of valor excuse me
[1:22:39] could you run that past me one more time
[1:22:43] he says you're going to deliver you're
[1:22:45] going to deliver israel of the
[1:22:47] midianites
[1:22:50] this is the man hiding his wheat
[1:22:54] you're going to be the one deliver them
[1:22:57] if gideon
[1:22:57] thought that he was a deliverer he
[1:22:59] wouldn't be hiding his weeds
[1:23:02] gideon thought he couldn't do it he
[1:23:04] wasn't powerful enough he wasn't able
[1:23:06] and he responds he says
[1:23:08] me but my family is the least in israel
[1:23:12] and my father's house is the least in
[1:23:14] that tribe
[1:23:15] we're the lowest so gideon has a
[1:23:18] perception
[1:23:19] of himself based off his vision
[1:23:22] and his carnal understanding based off
[1:23:25] his natural life his natural heritage
[1:23:27] his natural birth
[1:23:28] his position he's looking around and
[1:23:30] he's identifying
[1:23:32] himself by his natural position
[1:23:36] but this angel of the lord has given him
[1:23:38] a different identification
[1:23:41] you're not leasing the tribes you're not
[1:23:43] least in your father's house your
[1:23:44] father's not least in manasseh
[1:23:45] he says you're a mighty man of value
[1:23:47] you're the deliverer you're going to be
[1:23:49] the judge
[1:23:49] and you're going to deliver the hand
[1:23:51] them out of the hand of the midianites
[1:23:54] and and brother branham has this
[1:23:56] statement
[1:23:57] he says and have not i sent thee 1962 he
[1:24:00] says now gideon
[1:24:01] when he was out there threshing his
[1:24:03] wheat no doubt but that a prophet's
[1:24:04] message was going through his heart
[1:24:06] that the prophet said i'm the god of
[1:24:07] abraham isaac jacob
[1:24:09] i'm the one that brought you out of
[1:24:10] egypt i'm the one that gave you what you
[1:24:12] you've got turn to me there he and his
[1:24:15] father out there threshing his wheat an
[1:24:17] angel came to him or he thought it was
[1:24:18] an angel it happened to turn out to be
[1:24:20] it wasn't an angel it was god himself
[1:24:22] because it's capital
[1:24:23] l-o-r-d you see and when he spoke to
[1:24:27] gideon gideon was a little surprised
[1:24:30] he said now mighty man of valor listen
[1:24:33] he didn't know he was
[1:24:37] he didn't know he was and brother ben
[1:24:39] says maybe
[1:24:40] you don't know you are
[1:24:44] you might be many of those mighty men of
[1:24:46] valor tonight sitting here you say
[1:24:48] the little church small group oh my
[1:24:50] there was only two there
[1:24:51] him and his daddy there only has to be
[1:24:53] two here you and christ
[1:24:54] that's all it takes to be a mighty man
[1:24:56] of valor that's right
[1:24:59] he says and from that time 1960 listen
[1:25:02] we could all take a lesson from mary she
[1:25:05] never waited till she felt life
[1:25:07] she never waited for anything positive
[1:25:10] his word was enough for her
[1:25:13] she started on her way rejoicing saying
[1:25:15] testifying
[1:25:16] she was going to have the baby before
[1:25:18] any visible sign appeared
[1:25:20] that's the way a real believer takes god
[1:25:22] at his word
[1:25:24] and starts testifying giving god praise
[1:25:26] as soon as you can
[1:25:27] settle on the fact that god said so
[1:25:30] that's what makes the difference
[1:25:32] god said so
[1:25:35] gideon looked at his conditions god
[1:25:37] wasn't looking at his conditions
[1:25:40] there was there was a position for
[1:25:42] gideon to step into that was ordained
[1:25:44] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:46] it didn't matter what his natural
[1:25:48] conditions were it didn't matter
[1:25:50] what look what he looked at amen all
[1:25:52] that mattered what was what in the what
[1:25:53] was
[1:25:54] in the mind of god from before the
[1:25:55] foundation of the world
[1:25:57] and when the lord came in the form of an
[1:25:58] angel and said gideon thou mighty man of
[1:26:00] valor but everybody said he didn't know
[1:26:02] that he was
[1:26:04] but he still was how long had he been a
[1:26:07] mighty man of valor he was
[1:26:09] always a mighty man of valor before he
[1:26:11] was born he was a mighty man of valor
[1:26:13] before he came to this earth he was the
[1:26:15] one to deliver them of the hand of the
[1:26:17] midianites
[1:26:18] it was his ordained position but he was
[1:26:20] he had spiritual amnesia
[1:26:22] he was walking in an identity crisis
[1:26:24] because he knew who his granddaddy was
[1:26:26] he knew his daddy was he knew his tribe
[1:26:28] he knew where he grew up he knew his
[1:26:30] portion of the land but he didn't yet
[1:26:32] know
[1:26:32] anything about who he really was
[1:26:37] we've come to this life you can recite
[1:26:39] your genealogy you may know when your
[1:26:41] ancestors crossed the atlantic
[1:26:42] to set up as immigrants in the united
[1:26:44] states you may know where all they lived
[1:26:46] and how they moved
[1:26:47] you may have the family bible with who
[1:26:49] married who and who moved here
[1:26:50] who was born when and you still don't
[1:26:52] know nothing about yourself
[1:26:55] until the angel of the lord the
[1:26:57] messenger of this age begins to identify
[1:27:00] who you are and then you're starting to
[1:27:02] catch a real identity
[1:27:04] and something inside says be it unto me
[1:27:06] according to your word
[1:27:07] that's who i really am
[1:27:12] you're not weak you're not crippled
[1:27:13] you're not unpowerful you're not unable
[1:27:16] you're none of those things
[1:27:19] you're the bride of jesus christ that's
[1:27:22] the true identification
[1:27:26] brother branham comes to the first seal
[1:27:28] in 1963.
[1:27:30] he's preaching the first seal he says
[1:27:31] now watch he said
[1:27:33] it would be known in the last day but it
[1:27:35] comes forth in a church symbol
[1:27:37] do you understand he's talking about the
[1:27:39] symbols amen and
[1:27:41] the vision when when when christ peeled
[1:27:43] back the seal and a white horse rider
[1:27:44] went out and the pale horse
[1:27:46] is given in a church symbol do you
[1:27:47] understand it church it comes forth in a
[1:27:50] symbol of a church
[1:27:51] that they know there is a seal but just
[1:27:53] what it is yet they don't know because
[1:27:55] it's a white horse rider and it only is
[1:27:59] to be revealed at the last day
[1:28:00] when this actual seal is broken
[1:28:04] so the actual seal is broken in the last
[1:28:06] days yes
[1:28:08] broken to who
[1:28:11] not to christ but to the church notice
[1:28:14] now
[1:28:15] oh my that just makes me tremble
[1:28:19] stop for a minute what's making the
[1:28:22] prophet tremble
[1:28:25] he says that was the symbol form
[1:28:28] they for thousands of years saw the
[1:28:30] white horse rider and a crown was given
[1:28:32] and
[1:28:32] had a bow and they knew all of that
[1:28:36] but when it's actually time to be broken
[1:28:41] broken to who not to christ
[1:28:44] he already knows so when it comes time
[1:28:47] to break
[1:28:48] who's he going to break it to he's going
[1:28:50] to break it to the church
[1:28:51] he's going to break it to the bride and
[1:28:53] brother branham is here
[1:28:54] watching the breaking of the seal and
[1:28:57] he's looking at the people that it's
[1:28:58] broken to
[1:28:59] and he says that makes me tremble
[1:29:03] this wasn't a series that he preached
[1:29:06] friends amen
[1:29:07] this wasn't an idea that he had that he
[1:29:09] could take a series of
[1:29:10] ten sermons on that was a pretty good
[1:29:12] idea this was
[1:29:13] changing everything
[1:29:17] and he comes along and he says broke
[1:29:19] into who to the church oh that just
[1:29:21] makes me tremble
[1:29:22] i hope that the church truly understands
[1:29:24] it see what i mean
[1:29:26] you people i'm going to call you bride
[1:29:30] that you'll understand it so what's he
[1:29:33] doing
[1:29:34] he's here at the time that christ has
[1:29:36] come in the
[1:29:37] actual breaking of the seal to identify
[1:29:40] what the symbols are amen in the only
[1:29:43] way that it can be broken
[1:29:44] amen is if the seventh church age
[1:29:46] messenger is here
[1:29:48] and that the bride is sitting presents
[1:29:52] so in order for them to understand
[1:29:54] what's happening
[1:29:55] he says i'm going to call you bride
[1:29:59] so that you understand it
[1:30:05] you could be sitting there that day
[1:30:09] and you could be listening to the
[1:30:11] prophet
[1:30:12] and you could take the term bride as a
[1:30:15] generic term
[1:30:18] you're sitting there oh okay bride he's
[1:30:21] talking to that one and that one and
[1:30:23] that one he's talking to all these
[1:30:24] people
[1:30:26] but there's a different revelation when
[1:30:28] you sit there
[1:30:29] and he says i'm going to call you bride
[1:30:32] and you don't take it in a group setting
[1:30:36] you don't take it in a building you
[1:30:38] don't take it and people sitting in the
[1:30:39] building but when he says i'm going to
[1:30:40] call you bride
[1:30:41] something in your heart lightens like
[1:30:42] that and says he's talking about me
[1:30:44] me personally me me not the group
[1:30:48] me see that revelation changes
[1:30:52] everything
[1:30:53] the angel of the lord has come the angel
[1:30:55] standing in the pulpit and the angel
[1:30:57] the lord himself is breaking the seals
[1:30:59] through this angel and he's coming down
[1:31:01] and is the actual breaking of the seal
[1:31:03] it is the time it is the event it's
[1:31:05] taking place right then
[1:31:06] and he looks out and he says now i'm
[1:31:08] going to give you a positive
[1:31:09] identification
[1:31:10] so that it's not going to go over your
[1:31:11] head so that you won't miss what's
[1:31:13] taking place
[1:31:16] i'm going to call you bride
[1:31:19] oh hallelujah there's not another term
[1:31:22] that i want to hear
[1:31:24] there's not another thing that you can
[1:31:26] say to me that gets me more excited in
[1:31:27] this day
[1:31:28] when he says i'm going to call you bride
[1:31:30] and i can say be it unto me according to
[1:31:31] your word
[1:31:33] you're talking about me that prophet's
[1:31:35] calling me out he's identifying me
[1:31:37] how do i know because the seals were
[1:31:40] broke to me
[1:31:42] it's not broke to christ amen it's not
[1:31:45] broke amen to christ
[1:31:46] it's broke to the church to the bride
[1:31:49] and if i
[1:31:49] saw the breaking of those seals and i
[1:31:51] can see what the thunders are
[1:31:53] and i believe what it is then that makes
[1:31:55] me bride
[1:31:59] now mighty man of elder he didn't know
[1:32:01] that he was but he still was
[1:32:03] and when you see the breaking of the
[1:32:05] seals and you know by revelation
[1:32:07] what's going on amen it's identifying
[1:32:10] you
[1:32:11] as bride what else do you need to see
[1:32:14] what other manifestation do you have to
[1:32:16] have
[1:32:17] it's the revelation of the seals in your
[1:32:19] life that identifies you as the bride
[1:32:26] hallelujah
[1:32:32] see an angel came to gideon and gave him
[1:32:36] his identification
[1:32:38] and he had to believe what the angel
[1:32:39] said angel came to mary
[1:32:42] and gave her identification and she had
[1:32:43] to believe what the angel said
[1:32:46] but an angel has come to you
[1:32:50] to give you an identification and you
[1:32:52] have to believe what he said
[1:32:55] some of us have sat too long on our
[1:32:57] hands waiting for something to happen to
[1:32:59] identify me as the bride
[1:33:00] i'll know when i have a tingly sensation
[1:33:02] i'll know when this happens and i'll
[1:33:04] know when i see a vision
[1:33:05] i'll know when something else i'll know
[1:33:07] when god himself comes down into
[1:33:09] god himself has already come down and
[1:33:11] told you
[1:33:12] through the mouth of that prophet that
[1:33:14] was god speaking and breaking his seals
[1:33:17] to his bride
[1:33:18] what more are we looking for
[1:33:22] that was the event that is the
[1:33:24] identification
[1:33:25] it's already happened and now there's a
[1:33:27] people on this earth that's looking at
[1:33:28] that and saying
[1:33:29] i'm not waiting for another sign i'm not
[1:33:31] waiting something in my heart says
[1:33:33] that ain't nothing but the truth and if
[1:33:36] that's the truth and if i see it
[1:33:38] that's my identification i'm the bride
[1:33:43] what else do you need to be identified
[1:33:44] the brother you don't need anything else
[1:33:46] the devil has us sitting on our heels
[1:33:48] saying someday if i get a sign
[1:33:50] if i see something if i have a sensation
[1:33:53] next altar call
[1:33:54] next camp meeting forget all of that go
[1:33:56] back to the identification that the
[1:33:58] prophet gave
[1:34:01] in the breaking of the seal who's he
[1:34:03] breaking it to
[1:34:04] he's breaking it to the bride
[1:34:08] well i see the seals and i see the
[1:34:10] thunders and i believe in malachi 4
[1:34:12] and i believe in the coming of the lord
[1:34:13] i believe in all of that but i'm just
[1:34:15] waiting to know if i'm in the bride or
[1:34:16] not
[1:34:20] the devil has got you duped
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:25] the devil has got you sitting on your
[1:34:26] heels waiting for some day
[1:34:28] there is no some day the day is here the
[1:34:31] day
[1:34:32] is now it's time to quit questioning how
[1:34:34] will this be
[1:34:35] will there be a man will there be a
[1:34:37] prayer line will there be a meeting
[1:34:38] i know it's true but how will it be
[1:34:43] he's already identified you by breaking
[1:34:46] his seals to you
[1:34:47] by unveiling himself christ doesn't
[1:34:50] unveil himself
[1:34:51] to the foolish virgin he doesn't unveil
[1:34:53] himself to the harlots he unveils
[1:34:55] himself to his bride
[1:34:58] and i've seen the unveiling of god and
[1:35:01] something in my heart
[1:35:02] has a positive witness that that's
[1:35:04] nothing but the truth
[1:35:06] you can't say that's the truth the seals
[1:35:09] are open brother branham was malachi
[1:35:11] 4. revelations 10 7 it's all happened
[1:35:13] the mighty angels come down
[1:35:14] i believe it all oh if i was only in the
[1:35:17] bride
[1:35:19] that's a lie of the devil
[1:35:25] that's deception from your enemy trying
[1:35:27] to keep you from your promised land
[1:35:31] when brother banham says you're the
[1:35:33] bride
[1:35:35] you can't say i know he is and she is
[1:35:39] he is and she is it doesn't help you to
[1:35:42] be able to identify
[1:35:43] others as bride there's no
[1:35:47] victory in that revelation there's no
[1:35:50] victory in the revelation well i know my
[1:35:51] husband i know my wife is i know my
[1:35:53] mother is
[1:35:53] i know this one is i know that one
[1:35:55] there's no victory in that revelation
[1:35:57] but victory comes in the revelation is
[1:35:59] when he said i'm going to call you bride
[1:36:01] you say that prophet called me bride
[1:36:05] that's overcoming revelation that's
[1:36:08] grace being extended to you
[1:36:09] that's you coming in contact with the
[1:36:11] love of god and saying that's my
[1:36:13] position from before the foundation of
[1:36:15] the world

[1:43:22] this church that's too generic he
[1:43:24] is speaking to you as an individual
[1:43:27] this is your individual position in
[1:43:30] christ

[1:43:32] washing the blood of the lamb and
[1:43:33] believe
[1:43:34] every word of god

[1:43:45] perfect
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:48] well i just can't accept that i'm sorry
[1:43:51] i can
[1:43:53] i can not by my merit but by grace
[1:43:56] not by what i've done by what the five
[1:43:58] five alignment of planets has announced
[1:44:00] coming on the earth
[1:44:01] i can say it because an angel said it i
[1:44:03] can believe it because he told me
[1:44:05] i can believe it because there's a
[1:44:06] witness in my heart i believe that
[1:44:08] that's true for me
[1:44:09] i'm perfect not because of
[1:44:12] merit not because of deeds not because
[1:44:15] of my current
[1:44:16] conduct i'm perfect because i've been
[1:44:20] washed
[1:44:20] in the water of the bleeding word what
[1:44:24] word
[1:44:24] the full word which is jesus christ
[1:44:27] restored in this day we're feasting on
[1:44:30] that word
[1:44:30] we're covered in that blood we're washed
[1:44:33] by the washing of the water of the world
[1:44:36] no more denominational water that's
[1:44:38] already got filth inside of it you can't
[1:44:40] get purified
[1:44:41] by denominational water you can only be
[1:44:44] washed pure
[1:44:45] virtuous sinless as though you never sin
[1:44:47] in the first place
[1:44:48] the only word that can wash is the fully
[1:44:51] restored worse
[1:44:52] with no mind of man no man's
[1:44:54] interpretation
[1:44:55] no hybridization
[1:44:56] [Applause]
[1:44:58] and if you believe you've come to that
[1:45:00] and that you believe it despite yourself
[1:45:05] then the angel is talking to you
[1:45:08] not your neighbor not the church
[1:45:12] not the church back 50 years ago the
[1:45:14] angel is speaking to you
[1:45:18] can you receive it like gideon can you
[1:45:20] receive it like mary
[1:45:22] can you say be it unto me according to
[1:45:26] your word
[1:45:28] not my deeds according to your word
[1:45:33] you see friends the things that the
[1:45:36] prophet has told us that this bride
[1:45:38] has potential for is not possible
[1:45:43] if she's condemned
[1:45:47] the things that the lord has said that
[1:45:49] would be manifest through this bride in
[1:45:51] the end time
[1:45:52] is not possible if there's a speck
[1:45:56] of condemnation
[1:46:01] how can i speak something into existence
[1:46:02] i just yelled at my children
[1:46:08] there has to be something more powerful
[1:46:09] than my conduct
[1:46:11] there has to be something that has a
[1:46:13] more of a sanctifying power than my
[1:46:15] willpower
[1:46:16] there's if i'm going to come to
[1:46:17] perfection it's going to have to be
[1:46:19] something
[1:46:19] outside of me outside of my human
[1:46:23] my humanness outside of my human
[1:46:25] abilities because i will never come to
[1:46:27] this position
[1:46:28] in myself i've come to this position
[1:46:30] because he
[1:46:31] said so and then he made it possible by
[1:46:34] opening the word
[1:46:37] and guess what
[1:46:40] you can say the seals were broke in
[1:46:42] 1963.
[1:46:44] that's true but the seals were broke to
[1:46:46] me
[1:46:49] and if the seals were broke to me then
[1:46:52] i'm the bride
[1:46:54] and if i've been born in the spirit and
[1:46:56] washing the blood of jesus christ and
[1:46:57] believe every word of god
[1:46:59] i stand as though i've never sinned
[1:47:02] in the first place
[1:47:05] now when god unctious you speak yes
[1:47:09] because you're as righteous as god is
[1:47:11] righteous
[1:47:13] you're as pure as christ is pure because
[1:47:16] of what he's done
[1:47:19] let's look at luke chapter one
[1:47:24] and verse 46.
[1:47:30] this is mary's response luke 1 46
[1:47:35] and mary said my soul doth magnify the
[1:47:38] lord
[1:47:39] why she believed it before there was
[1:47:43] one trace of life she believed it
[1:47:47] for one thing before one thing
[1:47:50] in her physical form changed she
[1:47:53] believed it
[1:47:54] and mary said my soul doth magnify the
[1:47:57] lord
[1:47:58] my spirit hath rejoiced in the god my
[1:48:00] savior for he hath regarded the lowest
[1:48:02] state of his hand made
[1:48:03] for for behold for behold from
[1:48:07] henceforth all generations shall call me
[1:48:09] blessed
[1:48:10] for us it's a little backwards all the
[1:48:13] previous generations been looking
[1:48:14] forward to this one calling this one
[1:48:16] blessed
[1:48:19] for he that is mighty hath done to me
[1:48:22] great things and holy is his name
[1:48:24] and his mercy is on them that fear him
[1:48:26] from generation to generation
[1:48:28] he has showed strength with his arm he
[1:48:30] has scattered the proud and the
[1:48:31] imagination of their hearts he has put
[1:48:33] down the mighty from their seats and
[1:48:34] exalted them of low degree
[1:48:36] he has filled the hungry with good
[1:48:37] things in the rich he has sent empty
[1:48:39] away
[1:48:40] he hath hope and his servant israel in
[1:48:42] remembrance of his mercy as he spake to
[1:48:44] our fathers to abraham and to a seed
[1:48:46] forever what is this the cry of the
[1:48:49] virgin bride
[1:48:51] my soul does magnify the lord my spirit
[1:48:54] cries out in his mercy
[1:48:56] he has taken the nothings of the world
[1:48:58] and confounded the wisdom of the wise
[1:49:00] he has brought down the rich and he has
[1:49:02] fed the hungry amen god did this
[1:49:04] she couldn't do it we can't do it he's
[1:49:07] done it
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:09] and we believe it praise be unto god
[1:49:15] don't sit another day saying god could
[1:49:18] you just show me
[1:49:21] he's showing you in the breaking of the
[1:49:22] seals
[1:49:24] he's showing you in the revealing of the
[1:49:26] word he doesn't reveal his word
[1:49:30] to everybody he doesn't
[1:49:34] he doesn't he doesn't give the mystery
[1:49:36] of the seven unknown thunders to
[1:49:38] everyone he gives it to his bride
[1:49:44] i have no problem with the seals i have
[1:49:46] no problem with the thunders i have no
[1:49:48] problem with what's going to take place
[1:49:49] in the future i have no problem with the
[1:49:50] bride
[1:49:51] i just don't know if i meant
[1:49:54] every identification you need you're
[1:49:56] walking on top of
[1:49:58] ignoring the true signs looking for a
[1:50:01] false sign
[1:50:04] when i have a shaking sensation when i
[1:50:06] have a dynamic outpouring of spirit
[1:50:07] when i have a supernatural certain
[1:50:10] experience take place in my life then
[1:50:11] i'll know
[1:50:12] you're looking for false evidence and
[1:50:14] passing up the true evidence that's
[1:50:15] right in front of you

[1:50:20] from heaven has i told you who you are

[1:51:14] horrible life it doesn't matter
[1:51:17] all i'm saying lord is what you've said
[1:51:19] through your messenger i believe to be
[1:51:21] true
[1:51:23] when you broke those seals i believed
[1:51:24] every word of it
[1:51:26] amen when you magnified your word i
[1:51:28] believed it when you unveiled yourself
[1:51:29] i believed it well you said i believe i
[1:51:32] have no problem with the message
[1:51:33] i have no problem with the messenger i
[1:51:35] have no problem
[1:51:38] then i'd like to make a statement if you
[1:51:41] have no problem with the message
[1:51:43] no problem with the messenger no problem
[1:51:45] with the seals no problem with the
[1:51:46] revelations
[1:51:48] then you have no problem
[1:51:55] millions have heard this word and don't
[1:51:57] believe it
[1:52:00] millions have heard a tape or read a
[1:52:02] book or had a friend witness to him
[1:52:04] it may be billion by now i don't know
[1:52:06] how many
[1:52:07] and they couldn't receive it thousands
[1:52:10] and tens of thousands were raised in
[1:52:12] churches where the message was preached
[1:52:13] and they left but you couldn't
[1:52:18] millions heard a tape and didn't believe
[1:52:20] it you did
[1:52:23] tens of thousands and thousands of
[1:52:24] thousands amen have heard the seals
[1:52:27] and still wonder if the seals are open
[1:52:28] but you know they're open
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:34] if you don't have a problem with the
[1:52:36] word you don't have a problem
[1:52:40] quit letting the devil give you a
[1:52:42] problem
[1:52:44] but i don't live in overcoming life
[1:52:46] because you don't believe you're the
[1:52:47] bride
[1:52:51] but i should live a different kind of
[1:52:52] life when when you believe and identify
[1:52:54] yourself in the word and believe what he
[1:52:56] said about you you'll live an overcoming
[1:52:57] life
[1:52:59] your doubt is being expressed in your
[1:53:01] conduct
[1:53:04] amen but i just keep following us in and
[1:53:07] i just keep making the
[1:53:08] same mistakes it's because you're still
[1:53:09] wondering if you're the bride or not
[1:53:14] if we just accept what he said and
[1:53:16] receive it the way he said it
[1:53:18] and take what brother branham said and
[1:53:20] said that's me he's talking about
[1:53:22] and you believe it with all your heart
[1:53:23] and surrender yourself to guess
[1:53:25] what's going to happen your life is
[1:53:27] going to change
[1:53:29] things you struggle with will start
[1:53:31] falling away not through effort
[1:53:33] but the manifestation of your revelation
[1:53:35] pushes away
[1:53:36] unbelief all sin is a product of
[1:53:40] unbelief
[1:53:44] when i stop sinning i know i got it
[1:53:47] you'll never stop sinning
[1:53:50] when i overcome this you'll never
[1:53:51] overcome it unless
[1:53:53] you respond to the faith that's in your
[1:53:55] heart
[1:53:56] and receive what he's given you and
[1:53:58] believe it with all your heart
[1:54:00] that will change your life
[1:54:04] the devil's got us on merry-go-rounds
[1:54:08] keep circling someday i'll overcome this
[1:54:11] and
[1:54:11] when i overcome that the secret to
[1:54:13] overcoming is believing
[1:54:16] faith this is the victory that
[1:54:18] overcometh the world even
[1:54:19] our faith
[1:54:23] if you have no problem with the message
[1:54:25] you have no problem
[1:54:28] just accept it as such just believe it
[1:54:32] next time you hear a tape and brother
[1:54:33] bam says you're the sinless
[1:54:35] spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:54:38] say
[1:54:39] amen
[1:54:42] not amen to who he's talking to on the
[1:54:44] tape not amen to who the preacher is
[1:54:46] preaching but
[1:54:46] amen to me that's nothing but the truth
[1:54:49] and i believe it
[1:54:51] and you keep confessing it and you keep
[1:54:53] walking it and you keep believing
[1:54:55] it and watch what happens to your life
[1:54:58] those things just begin to fade away
[1:55:03] i'm tired of the devil lying
[1:55:07] to god's children i'm tired of the
[1:55:10] deception
[1:55:11] god's children living below their
[1:55:12] privileges why it's because of what we
[1:55:14] believe
[1:55:17] but if we'll just walk into the faith
[1:55:19] that's there
[1:55:21] and just surrender to it and just give
[1:55:23] him preeminence
[1:55:25] not try to figure anything out not try
[1:55:27] to figure out how it's going to be
[1:55:29] how is this going to happen how's it
[1:55:30] going to be it doesn't matter
[1:55:32] the holy ghost will overshadow you you
[1:55:35] just say be it unto me according to
[1:55:37] that word that you just spoke
[1:55:40] what word sinless spotless virtuous
[1:55:42] bride of jesus christ you never did it
[1:55:43] in the beginning

[1:55:50] said

[1:56:03] i've got to prove i'm a bride no you
[1:56:04] don't
[1:56:06] the burden of proof is not on you the
[1:56:08] burden of proof is on the one who called
[1:56:10] you the bride
[1:56:13] the one who identified you is the one
[1:56:15] who has to prove what he's identified
[1:56:18] well i just have to prove there's got to
[1:56:20] be a healing there's got to be a
[1:56:22] manifestation there's got to be a
[1:56:23] perfect life
[1:56:24] amen you're going to get really tired
[1:56:26] really fast
[1:56:29] the burden of proof is not yours the
[1:56:32] burden of proof is the one who said
[1:56:34] you're the bride
[1:56:36] lord you said it i accept it and receive
[1:56:40] it
[1:56:41] now bring it to pass in my life
[1:56:46] isn't that simpler
[1:56:49] that's freedom
[1:56:53] every other thought is bondage
[1:56:57] that is total liberty and freedom in
[1:57:00] christ
[1:57:02] it's not a life you live it's a life he
[1:57:05] lives through you
[1:57:07] but he can only do what you believe
[1:57:13] he's there he's there in capernaum
[1:57:17] he's there in nazareth he's there to
[1:57:19] heal
[1:57:20] everybody but he couldn't do many money
[1:57:23] miracles because of their unbelief
[1:57:28] he was there to heal the multitudes
[1:57:31] he would go into one place they would
[1:57:33] believe and everybody in the city would
[1:57:34] be healed
[1:57:35] he would go to his own hometown and they
[1:57:38] would have doubts
[1:57:39] and only a few were healed see there's a
[1:57:42] there's a law that his word operates by
[1:57:45] faith
[1:57:48] so just release faith quit holding it
[1:57:51] back
[1:57:52] quit waiting quit looking for another
[1:57:54] time just release the faith that's in
[1:57:56] your heart and say lord i believe your
[1:57:57] word
[1:57:58] i believe you've opened the seals i
[1:58:00] believe you've come down as the mighty
[1:58:02] angel
[1:58:02] i believe revelation 10 1-7 has happened
[1:58:05] i believe it i believe i'm the bride i
[1:58:08] believe it i don't understand it but i
[1:58:10] believe it
[1:58:11] and i'm just gonna confess it i'm just
[1:58:13] gonna tell others about it
[1:58:14] i'm gonna say i'm the bride why because
[1:58:17] your angel said i was
[1:58:20] who's he breaking it to to the church to
[1:58:22] the bride what's broken to me i must be
[1:58:25] the bride
[1:58:27] don't overthink it just receive it
[1:58:29] [Music]
[1:58:31] and when you receive it confess it when
[1:58:34] you confess it walk in it
[1:58:36] and watch what happens next god bless
[1:58:39] you let's all stand
[1:58:43] amen friends
[1:58:48] bennett made a statement he said when
[1:58:51] the bride can discern
[1:58:53] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:58:54] the christian church and resist and
[1:58:56] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:58:58] amen the devil will be powerless before
[1:59:01] her
[1:59:02] right now i don't want to explain that i
[1:59:05] just want to talk about this powerless
[1:59:06] devil
[1:59:09] what makes the devil powerful
[1:59:14] and what makes him powerless see there's
[1:59:18] only one power that he has really
[1:59:21] he says well he has cancer and he has
[1:59:23] the car wrecks and no he really only has
[1:59:25] one power
[1:59:26] and that power is deception
[1:59:29] it's the only power he has is the power
[1:59:32] of deception
[1:59:34] and when a true revelation comes it
[1:59:36] dispels the deception and he
[1:59:38] he is powerless before her by what
[1:59:41] by the full revelation of the full word
[1:59:43] he is rendered powerless
[1:59:47] so don't let him deceive you about your
[1:59:50] identification
[1:59:51] because when you can receive who you
[1:59:53] really are and believe it by faith and
[1:59:55] confess it and act on it
[1:59:57] before you see one thing change but if
[2:00:00] you truly can believe it
[2:00:01] and truly confess it and stand on it he
[2:00:04] becomes
[2:00:05] powerless to hinder you from being the
[2:00:08] bride
[2:00:11] so what's he using deception
[2:00:14] lies don't believe him anymore
[2:00:18] say i refuse to believe the devil
[2:00:21] and i accept the angel messenger
[2:00:26] hallelujah well someday if he writes it
[2:00:30] in the skies
[2:00:32] he already circled a cloud what more do
[2:00:35] you need
[2:00:37] what other sign do we need to just
[2:00:40] surrender and say
[2:00:41] it's me it's me i'm the bride
[2:00:46] i know it why because i believe
[2:00:50] not my conduct not my genealogy
[2:00:54] not my years of service in the message
[2:00:58] none of that matters what matters
[2:01:01] is that i believe it and i know it
[2:01:04] and it's true and i'm willing to stand
[2:01:07] on it
[2:01:08] by revelation are you the bride
[2:01:11] absolutely how do you know because he
[2:01:14] broke the seals to me
[2:01:16] because a messenger identified me as a
[2:01:19] bride
[2:01:19] i believe it but what signs you have in
[2:01:22] your life and what happened when you got
[2:01:23] the holy ghost where is your
[2:01:26] he never told me to look for that
[2:01:31] he told me to believe and to receive
[2:01:36] and that i would have an experience of
[2:01:38] the new birth
[2:01:39] and that experience is a changed life
[2:01:46] stop looking for supernatural signs
[2:01:48] we've got gobs of them
[2:01:50] tons of them look for the opening of the
[2:01:53] word
[2:01:55] look for it being revealed to his bride
[2:01:58] and if he's revealing his word to you
[2:02:00] if your heart is burning on fire under
[2:02:02] the preaching of the word
[2:02:04] what's happening whose heart's burning
[2:02:09] well it's the bridegroom speaking to his
[2:02:11] bride
[2:02:13] a thousand other girls may not care what
[2:02:15] he says but there's one girl whose heart
[2:02:17] burns whenever the bridegroom speaks
[2:02:19] [Applause]
[2:02:20] i just get so excited when i listen to a
[2:02:22] message when i read the books
[2:02:24] i just something in me keeps stirring
[2:02:26] what is that friends
[2:02:28] that's your identification that's who
[2:02:31] you really are
[2:02:33] amen stop stop looking for something
[2:02:36] else and just say

[2:02:56] goes so much deeper than that it goes
[2:02:57] down into our soul and it ignites a fire
[2:03:00] that's more than emotion that's more
[2:03:02] than intellect it's more than reasoning
[2:03:04] it's a reality burning within us lord we
[2:03:08] just ask
[2:03:08] now that you would just help us to
[2:03:11] resist all the lies of the enemy

[2:03:16] you're a little bride
[2:03:17] and lord she's not yet been able to step
[2:03:19] into that pure identification given by
[2:03:21] your messenger
[2:03:23] because of a doubt because of a concern
[2:03:25] because of a question
[2:03:27] i pray god that they would be able to
[2:03:29] push all those things aside
[2:03:32] and say be it unto me according to your
[2:03:34] word

[2:06:26] brother venom said we could all take a
[2:06:28] lesson from mary
[2:06:30] before she felt one thing
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:33] before she had one positive sign of life
[2:06:37] she testified
[2:06:41] we could all take a lesson from mary
[2:06:45] before there's one sign before one
[2:06:48] supernatural event takes place
[2:06:51] i believe i'm the bride the supernatural
[2:06:54] event has already taken place
[2:06:56] he's given you eyes to see that's the
[2:06:59] most supernatural event of them all

[2:07:07] message of the hour
[2:07:09] that have been given the power to open
[2:07:10] blinded eyes

[2:07:17] the message of the hour have been given
[2:07:18] the power to raise the dead
[2:07:22] so what's the greatest sign not raising
[2:07:25] the dead
[2:07:26] not opening blinded eyes not healing the
[2:07:28] sick what's the greatest sign
[2:07:31] the greatest sign is having isaf
[2:07:35] it makes your eyes come open and you see
[2:07:38] the message for your day
[2:07:40] that's the greatest sign friends
[2:07:43] you can be blind and speak in tongues
[2:07:46] and dance in the spirit and raise the
[2:07:47] dead
[2:07:49] but only the bride gets the isaf
[2:07:54] and only the bride has eyes to see
[2:07:59] what other sign do you want what other
[2:08:01] manifestation are you looking for
[2:08:03] the greatest one that you could ever get
