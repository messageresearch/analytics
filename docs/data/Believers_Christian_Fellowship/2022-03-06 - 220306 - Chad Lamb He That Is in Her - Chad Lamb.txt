revelation into your bride lord help us to see with clarity what you want us to see in this day lord give us the eye salve lord to see i pray god you would take this vessel into your control lord and break the bread of life you would take your word and that you would dispense it now lord that we by your spirit would catch the revelation of what you want to speak to us lord and that we would be

control move lord freely amongst your people and have your way with us we pray in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you what we're standing let's turn to the book of ephesians together and look at ephesians chapter 5 together and just want to remind you that there will be a communion service and feet washing this afternoon so we don't want to forget that um also brother roshan messi will be coming in this week he'll be coming in on thursday and he'll be preaching for us on sunday so it's the first time that he's been able to get out since all the covert restrictions started so he's coming from india so we're really excited to have our brother back and and check up with him and see how he's doing he's actually going to be staying for almost a week so be preaching for us on sunday and on wednesday so i'm really happy to have our brother i also want to remind you that this wednesday we're going to start our tape service and the book we're going to be doing is god's power to transform there's a blue rack out here beside the welcome desk that has the book so you can get a book you can use your tablet you can use your phone or whatever but we'll start into that this coming wednesday so i don't want you to forget that let's read ephesians chapter 5 verse 28 so want men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones i love that scripture i mean it's so direct and it's so powerful it's so tangible it's so effective in this dimension this isn't a theory this is reality for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church amen god bless you amen as you're seated may the lord bless the reading of his word and this is something that is a reality that is for us to realize in this age that we live in that we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones so you know the apostle paul and and peter and the different ones the apostles in the new testament as they're giving out the word you realize uh i realize as i meditate on this that the apostle paul never wrote an epistle never preached anything so that it it would be included in the bible and be put on print so that we could have it in a book now god purposed that so that we'd have it at the end time but the apostle paul preached so that that word would live in somebody amen and god allowed it to be put into print and to be collected for the end time when there would be a full manifestation of all that paul taught amen so that we could read that but paul didn't paul didn't want i should say this way paul didn't want to write a bible amen paul wanted to make living epistles amen the people to be the word he preached so that that preaching would manifest in a people amen and that's the day that we live in when all that has been preached and all that has been taught and all the shadows and all the types come into manifestation in a people amen and the bride if you could turn with me to colossians chapter one we'll grab another scripture here colossians chapter 1 and verse 18. and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so we know that the church is his body amen in a physical way upon this earth she is his body and he is the head and so we've talked about that so much and brother branham brought that to us that the headship had united with the body at the end time and for a title i wanted to take for a text he that is in her he that is in her and we'll just see how we go this day and the spoken word is the original seed the prophet says christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil you believe that now i can't explain all this i'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the high places so you won't stay too long christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right you all believe that what was he god's word which destroys the works of the hybrid devil so what is it that destroys the devil the word amen so what was christ he was the word made flesh so he was manifest to destroy the works of the devil so it was the word of god amen when it came into manifestation was the dare to destroy the works of the devil in the works of the devil was the hybridization of the word amen so the word made flesh the word coming into manifestation is to destroy the works of the devil he he was done to do that he was born to do that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same because the body is head and body is together that right if christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was that's right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word so the word church the bride that is the word she is manifest to destroy the works of the devil because she is the word made flesh let's go to first john i just want to lay in some of these scriptures i've got quite a few quotes that i want to read i want to lay in these scriptures and i want to move quickly through these and get to a main thought that i've been meditating on first john 4 4. first john chapter 4 and verse 4. ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now the prophet god is going to go to the scripture and refer to this and he says may i read it again and this is the message he that is in you year of god little children and overcome them and and the prophet of god interjects here talking of the antichrist so he says you've overcome them you've overcome those that are influenced by the antichrist or those under the antichrist spirit you have overcome them talking of the antichrist because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world two pronouns see he personal pronoun he that is in the world he that is in you he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world amen so there's two he's amen the he that's in you is christ and he that's in the world is the antichrist and he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world amen i think it's interesting to see how crazy things are getting in the world and how out of control things have gotten and are continuing to get amen and it seems like amen every evil thing is on the rampage and wickedness on every corner amen but we must remember that he that is in us is greater than he that's in the world so if he that's in the world as having greater control of all finances of all politics of of of everything and immorality and sin amen in in church politics and religious deceit if it's going off the charts amen as as he that's in the world has gained more and more power then we have to always realize he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world so it can never the power of antichrist being manifest and the world can day can never overpower he that's in you and this is so important for us to remember it's not that we haven't heard these things and we don't know these things but we still live in a body of flesh and we live in a an atmosphere that is contrary to the word of god and we must be reminded over and over and over again that he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world so he that's in the world will never conquer he that's in you so it can never get so bad amen that god will still not overcome by his manifested word it'll never it'll never overpower christ never let's go to colossians chapter one colossians chapter 1 and now let's go further down into verse 26. even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generation but now is made manifest to saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory i read that scripture so many times when i preach but it is our scripture amen it is the time for the realization of this the revelation to hit home and to move into manifestation because this is the great mystery that's to be made known among the gentiles christ in you the hope of glory greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world in the message calling jesus on the scene the prophet says now you say how could he be god and be man see there is the mystery see in body he was man in spirit he was god see someone asked me he said then how did how who did he pray to in the garden of gethsemane i said i'll answer you that when you answer this do you believe you have the holy ghost they answered yes i said then who do you pray to where is he at when you pray to him when you claim you have him and yet you're praying to him they were trying to to to you know disprove the deity of jesus christ and they say well who did he pray to in the garden of gethsemane and and brother branham just just the same way that jesus christ did to the pharisees he said well i'll ask you one question do you have the holy ghost yes then who do you pray to when you pray amen see if if the devil can get us into spiritual amnesia and we can forget amen who it is that dwells in us if we forget who has been restored in this day who has come back to unite with the church amen and we make it a minor thing instead of the major thing that it is amen then the devil begins to strip us amen of the power that has come in this day the revelation and realization of who it is that is coming to the bride and then when we get into hours of distress and hours of trouble and in times of agony and anxiety amen we begin to call out as if god is far away amen we begin to cry oh god come and help me o god who who is far far away from me right now amen and that is a reverse back into spiritual amnesia that is going backwards in denominationalism amen but god amen has come down to headship is coming united with the bride and through the baptism of the holy ghost it's greater than he that's in you than he that's in the world and he hasn't come to you to leave you he's come to stay and so there's no crying out to a god who's a million miles away amen there is a present tense god dwelling with this bride and he's not leaving her it doesn't mean that your faith will not be tested it doesn't mean that god will be quiet amen so that you your faith can come to the forefront and the faith that's in you can can take the word and overcome by the word amen you may not feel his presence but it doesn't change his dwelling place these things we we have to be reminded of all the time because if you're not in a stressful situation and you haven't felt anxiety for a few days just hold on because it's coming because he he loves to test his children he loves to prove his bride and so we have to remember the scriptures we have to believe the word and understand that we live in the day that all this word is being fulfilled let's go to first corinthians 6. first corinthians chapter 6 and verse 19. what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own your body is the temple of the holy ghost you're templing christ he's with you his spirit is inside of you let's go over to ephesians chapter 2. and let's look at verse 19 ephesians chapter 2 verse 19 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the buildings fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god through the spirit so where is the god that we're praying to you where is christ in this hour where is this great holy spirit that is returned in full measure to the bride he is in the bride amen he's here he's with us he's in us friends he's not uh he's not left us he didn't he wasn't just here amen to show us that he was here and do mighty works to the prophet and then take off and vanish but he's here he's he's here in fullness the fullness of the word has brought back the fullness of the spirit because the word is the spirit and life so the full spirit in life is here with the full word and he's not and then he's not coming and going he's here friends he's here with the bride amen greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world there's nothing to be afraid of amen there's tragedy that comes yes there's difficulties that come and will come the bible says man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble that's the truth amen but it's also true that he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you but i'll be with you even unto the end of the world he's with us amen amen when we get into tragedy we get into trouble in difficult circumstances we have to remember i'm not screaming and crying and stomping for a god that's a million miles away amen he knows my thoughts amen he knows my whispered prayer he knows what i'm saying in the sincerity of my heart amen but he's with me and and i don't want to start talking to him as if he is far away amen i want to start talking to the one that's closer than a brother amen because what happens many times when we get into trouble and we get into circumstances and situations amen the way that we respond to that situation is actually straining the relationship between us and christ not on his part but on our part he never left he never moved but in our own mentality we put him away amen we put him far away he's distance in our mind in our understanding we've distanced him from ourselves and our trial and our situation and we've put a strain on the relationship and hindered our faith just by the way we speak man if we would just catch the revelation that's coming this hour and hold to it in the face of trial on the worst day when the world is crashing down all around us and everything is falling apart if we could stick with the revelation the same way we have it on our best day i said god is with me god is in me he knows the way that i take i'm in his hand i'll never be separated from him amen if you we can take that same approach in the midst of our worst trouble amen we'll see that our faith will not falter at the hour of trial many times our faith is hindered by the way we speak we hinder ourselves by the attitude we take and we don't speak by revelation we begin to speak by fear we begin to speak by anxiety and all these human emotions hey you're going to have human emotions you're not going to be able to stop the human emotions from coming as long as you live in this body in this condition the emotions will come but there's got to be something deeper than the emotions a reality that says wait a minute nothing's changed with me in god i'm tense i'm nervous i'm fearful i i have all of these crazy emotions going on all around me amen but i'm going to stop long enough to say i still believe the word is true that i am tabernacling the holy ghost that the holy spirit has not left me that i'm still the temple i'm still part of the habitation of god i'm still one of those lively stones he's still with me i'm still in his hand and there's nothing he's not further away today than he was in church on sunday amen listen there's been times that we needed this teaching there's times coming that we're going to need to remember this we have to pray that we can speak faith speak the revelation let it come out of our mouths the prophet of god tells us in christ as the mystery of god revealed he said then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of god is within you so the bible jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and god was won and the word of god is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as adam and eve in the beginning in the garden of eden the threefold mystery of god his body what's the threefold mystery of god his body what's his body jesus christ and jesus christ body is the church she's the completion of the finishing of the body of christ because as adam was completed in male and female jesus christ is completed in male and female so the church is the body of christ according to the word and she is completing or finishing the body of jesus christ which is the body of god which is the restoration of the threefold purpose for god to come down tangible and flesh and dwell amongst his attributes that is the threefold plan of god you're part of that that's not just a doctrine to say amen to on sunday that's a reality that'll hold you when everything's going wrong in your life paul didn't preach these things to the church so that they would write them in a bible and we would say well look that's what paul said amen paul said it so it'll be fleshed out amen so to be lived and the message didn't come so we can say wow what a revelation wow if you can believe that look at the things that brother branham was able no the message came so the message would be flesh in you amen so that this reality would not fade away from the bride yes and the message when their eyes were open they knew him he says and the whole thing is god unfolding himself and his attributes and then god being made material tangible and we can talk to speak with in his whole church body and everything we can talk to and speak with god how when we fellowship with one another because the whole plan was for god to become tangible god unfolding himself in his attributes and then god being made material tangible how is he doing it he's doing it in his church i want to read the god being made material tangible that we can talk to speak with in his whole church body in everything amen you know how it is when you get into some tight spots and you get into some trouble amen the devil always wants to move you off into isolation amen because separating you from the body is separating you from god because we can talk to talk with speak with god tangible in flesh and that fellowship will give us strength and encourage us god is not far away god is all around us he's within us and around us amen that's why the fellowship of saints is so critical amen to the christian faith through the christian wong amen because god is in his people therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life you can't have it no other way if you got eternal life you always was and the masterpiece message the prophet of god says and then come finally the great head the head of it all the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets the prophet of god is speaking of the rebuilding of the masterpiece in the old testament the restoration of adam he said it was it was built started being built back by the patriarchs and then the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it here comes the head of all of it jesus came on the scene there when his headpiece was put on it we find in him the entire handiwork of god we find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word and the fullness of the word now again god has the perfect masterpiece again so he's typing the rebuilding of the body of christ through the old testament is rebuilding the masterpiece rebuilding the sun that fell because adam was the son of god that had fallen now there's building back a body a son of god but but all of it was painting the picture of christ every prophet they were all pointing towards christ amen all the patriarchs they were pointing towards christ and here he comes as the headship on top of all of that body amen when he came in flash he was the headship he was the headstone capping it off and in him was the fullness of all of that manifestation god had restored that masterpiece but then he goes on to say christ is the mystery of god revealed and to be sure that the whole rapture now luther was a part wesley was a part the prophets was apart if they aren't apart just in the revelation that they was making up the body feet toes arms and so forth until the head which we get to that in a few minutes see that makes the entire rapture it's the body of the word which is christ so the the new testament has been building another body and we've talked about this many times it's the body of the church of the bride of jesus christ but he says in the voice of the sign now if the lord jesus christ the son of god whom i have proven by the bible promised that he would return in the last days and reveal himself in the fullness of his spirit just like the church coming up like it comes from a human being all the way from the feet comes up the thighs up to the head and the head is the head of the body and the body has come up ever since that first church come right on up this and the reformations has come up till now it's come through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost now it's the head christ coming to the body the body of christ and modern events made clear by prophecy he says but he said i'll meet them in one place the place i put my name that's in jesus christ that's where god put his name that's the only place he'll meet you and it's christ is the word the same yesterday it's growed from the feet thighs and now it's in the head fixing to go manifesting in full measure the bride the same as the groom i'm reading these quotes to show you that at the end of the church ages when god is building back a bride he's going to cap that bride off with the headship with jesus christ himself but that headship amen is going to be a unification of the word with the bride not something separate but you'll see the head in the bride the headship is coming to the body to the bride in the end time which will be another capstone not capping off the old testament but now capping off the new testament which will be the new testament in fullness in his body in the bride the headstone and the body united together as one do we believe that then let's act like we believe that i'm speaking to myself now we believe it we can say amen to it something in us cries out that that's the truth amen but but that must relate into a life a life amen that there's a confidence that the things that we've been taught are absolutely thus saith the lord amen they're not ideas amen they're realities amen they're not concepts they are the truth amen they are not they are not spiritual things amen that stay spiritual things but they're spiritual things that are manifested in fleshly things there is a reality to the things that we're preaching and the reality is that christ the headship has come into the body and now if you want to see christ where is christ dwelling christ is dwelling in his bride that is the capstone ministry that is the capping of the old testament the headship is in the body amen and if that's true greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world greater than any other time in history the manifestation the revelation has come to such a full measure amen that we should know these things we should be so rooted and so grounded in these things that we can overcome the most wicked of all ages and who knows what comes next really who knows what comes next who knows what kind of trouble what kind of danger what kind of hardship who knows what comes next amen uh i grew up all my life in the united states of america that was safe all my life amen but i don't think it's safe anymore it's certainly not as insulated and protected as it was when i was a boy there's trouble all around trouble's not only far away anymore trouble's nearby but it doesn't change the message it doesn't change the reality of what is materializing in this day again in modern events made clear by prophecy he said i'll meet them and i already read that jehovah jireh part 1 now remember that christ is risen from the dead and is among us and get that in your mind christ raised from the dead and is among us now we have seen all kinds of great moves and shoutings and praising god all fine we've spoken tongues and prophesied and all we've seen all that that's fine that comes right along with it but remember the last thing is his divine presence the word itself you know when i come to the pulpit we were singing that song surely the presence of the lord is in this place what i'll tell you his presence is only here if his word is here we can have a sensation or a feeling a tingling we can have all kinds of emotions that move on our flesh but his presence is only here if the word is here the deception that was in the pentecostal age that moved through was that the experiences and the sensations were his presence and although his presence can come with sensation and experiences his experiences alone do not denote his presence sensation alone does not denote his presence but his presence is here when his word is here and you don't have to feel anything for that to be true this is something that's so important because if not we'll get caught back up in pentecostalism where we're always seeking another feeling another feeling another feeling and we'll leave the word for a feeling and then when we've left the word for a feeling we'll call it the presence of the lord but brother branham said that remember the last thing is his divine presence the word itself he is the word the head the word it's coming to the body the last thing is the divine presence of god which is the word itself and so in order to have the divine presence you must have the word and when you have the divine presence you may or may not have a feeling and sometimes when we get into our testing time now do you believe that the bride has to be tested do you believe that there's trials tribulations and tests that wait for each one of us sometimes when we get into our testing time amen we won't feel anything we actually will feel negative things our body will send us negative signals of fear and anxiety and all kinds of things will hit our body and we won't feel what we call the presence of the lord we'll feel nothing we'll just feel fear we'll feel anxiety we'll fear we'll feel all kinds of feelings amen and we if we're not grounded on the word and the word only and we're too uh dependent upon feelings and sensations we'll begin to feel like we're alone and god's not with us we'll begin to feel like god's not near we'll begin to feel more panicked like like god's not in this trial hey if you've been born again by the spirit of god and you're in the trial god's in the trial because god's in you not not coming to you to leave you coming you but he'll not allow amen because you have to go through the testing amen god is not sometimes going to allow the feelings amen amen he's not even sometimes going to speak to you have you ever had god go silent on you and when god goes silent on you and when you need him the most it feels like sometimes when you desperately need him the most god goes silent and if we if we are stuck in denominationalism we will feel like god's not in this trial we're all alone uh uh something is bad wrong amen but nothing's wrong you have to go through a testing amen and to go through a testing he's not going to make everything easy for you that's no test amen you have to go and he'll pull the feelings away he won't even speak to you amen why because the bride has to learn to operate on the word and the word only this bride has got to be able to stand on the word amen now i don't want anybody in any way to misunderstand me i want to feel his presence do you want to feel his presence i want to i want to feel it in a tangible way i want him to speak to me amen i want god to make his will amen so real to me that i know exactly what he wants me to do i want him to speak to me in prayer i want to feel his presence i want the sensation that comes from knowing that god is speaking in this moment and the thrill that thrills my soul i want all of that i want it in the services i want it in my prayer life i mean i want it in the dynamics of preaching i want it all but i am not i do not want to be so dependent on those things that i will question where god is in the midst of a trial because i become so dependent on those things to make me believe that he's here when i can't just take his word when he promised to be here that has to be enough for me he said i'll never leave you i believe it amen he said no man will pluck you from my hand i believe it amen when i feel nothing i believe it when he's not speaking i still believe it it's an exercise we have to exercise our faith and believe it in the face of all obstacles faith is the thing that overcomes amen this is the victory that overcome with the world even our faith so god will train our faith and the devil will train us to seek sensations to rob us of faith but feeling or no feeling the message is true feeling or no feeling the scriptures haven't changed feelings are such a fickle thing i've had such i've had some wonderful times with the lord that were so incredibly special to me that i wish i could live in that atmosphere always supernatural things the lord has done to me ways that he made his presence known and spoke to me and it felt wonderful and i felt like a son of god i felt like part of the bride i felt so connected to god and sometimes hours later or a day later i feel so opposite to that feeling you cannot we cannot rely on those things we must rely upon the word the last thing is his divine presence the word itself i said that again because i i want it to sink in so deep what has come his divine presence have come how's it come it's come with the fullness of the word the word itself he is the word the head the word it's coming to the body and the message the sign of this time he says now that's the same thing that constitutes a new birth water blood spirit the elements that come from his body is what makes his body see it comes from the body is the material that that that takes to make his bride because adam and his bride adam had his bride taken from his body christ has his bride taken from his body and when christ died there was three elements that came from his body water blood spirit justification through believing water sanctification through the blood the baptism of the holy spirit now this last great step must come into perfection that the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it'll make the head and body unite together see that's the body he is the head in the body i like the way brother brim said that he is the head in the body where is the head well the head has come down to unite with the body if you say that the head has come down to unite to the body i can have the head separate from the body just that terminology in our minds the head has come down to unite from the body no the head has come to unite with the body and in uniting with the body it has become one with the body so the body is the head the headships in the body the body is expressing the hedge shim so the capstones in the bride the bride has become the manifestation of the capstone the headship is in the body so i'm not looking around where is the headship where the capstones come down to unite with the body i've got to go find the capstone the capstone is in the body amen in christ is the mystery of god revealed it says now we see the promise being fulfilled christ the true headship going in coming in his bride i love how he changes that he says christ the true hedge of going in he corrects it coming in his bride where's the headship it's coming in bright form doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling the word as he did it first in john 14 12. he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one in works and in signs in life vindicated by god himself through his promised word for the last day he promised this in the last day now if you're spiritual you'll catch it now i want to get to a thought that i've been meditating on for a while in the it's in the message souls that are in prison now the prophet of god he has an experience many of us know we've listened to the message we've spoken about this before but he has an experience when he's a boy and he gets shot and he goes into an operation and and while he's on the operating table or sometime around that event he goes into hell he falls he feels himself descending down into hell and when he's in hell you know he tells us that he called out for daddy there was no daddy there called out for mama there was no mama there he called up for god there was no god there and he tells us he was descending into the realms of the lost and and when he got deep down he started seeing women and he started seeing they looked funny they had uh colored around their eyes and he said they were pointed back and he started describing what what hell was like and what they were there and the sounds and and the feeling and and he goes to tucson arizona in 1963 on a shopping trip with his wife and when he's on the shopping trip he has that experience where there's people all around talking in jc penney's he said you know talking about the price of this and talking and then up from the escalator comes two women speaking in spanish and they've got the same paint on their eyes the same hair done the same way and the eyes painted back he said like cat eyes and he says all of a sudden there i was in hell again he says in paragraph 97 i thought then as i noticed them cankered looking eyes on them women they were the spanish the french the indian the white and all together but the great big heads you know bushed up with them combs the way they comb it back way big and then comes out you know and you know how they do fix it in like they do and then them cankered looking eyes in the eyes with the paint they run back like a cat's eyes and them talking and there was there i was again standing there in jc penney's store back in hell again this experience it it affected him so much that he was troubled and he even leaned on his wife's arm to walk out of the store he had to go home and he was so troubled by what he saw because of the feeling of being back in hell again and and brother branham says there i was again standing there in jcpenney store back in hell again this is this is what prompted brother branham to preach souls that are in prison now because he saw hell had now erupted on earth earth was now influenced so much by hell it was manifesting hell listen that was 1963. here we are in 2022 if hell was being manifested on earth then hell is being manifested on earth today and brother branham was and he was back in hell again he literally went through the same experience he did as a boy now what he experienced deep in the abyss now was in jcpenney store think about that friends hell upon earth hell opened up and spilled out upon earth but greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world if hell had spilled out upon the earth then something else must be spilled out upon the earth too if hell was manifesting himself on earth amen there's never anything coming from the kingdom of the devil that'll ever conquer he that is in you amen so as long as he is in you there's nothing that's greater than this so if hell if what was deep down in hell was now upon earth amen what was high in the heavens was now upon earth too what was deep buried in the abyss was spilled out on earth what was in the back cart of god's mind was now spilled out upon earth there was two forces and he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world that will never overcome you so brother bannon is preaching he comes back to preach souls that are in prison now and he was troubled by seeing hell spilled out upon the earth the gates of hell open amen in hell on earth earth and a hellish condition and he begins to to preach about could it be over and it's just a question in his mind he said one day it will be has the last one been called are these souls that are in prison now that we're preaching to amen any and he begins to ask the question he's not i'm not saying that it is but one day it will be it looks very much like it is and the reason he's asking the question is because he knows the lamb's taking the book there's no reason to ask the question if the lamb hadn't taken the book and loosed the seals so now he's asking questions he knows the lamb took the book and loosed the seals now he's asking the question is it all over is there no more mercy that was in the morning service he's preaching soldier in prison on the 10th of november in 1963 and it's amazing he comes back for the evening service and when he comes back in the evening service guess what he preaches he that is in you in the morning service he preaches hell is on earth amen is there no more mercy then he comes back and preaches he that's in you amen the answer to the question is he that's in you the answer to the dilemma is he that's in you the answer come in the evening it's he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world so he tells two stories one story he tells in the morning that's his experience in jcpenney's then he comes in the evening he this june and he tells another story and i went back and i listened to what brother branham said and and when he was in the message soul's in prison now now that's in november november 10th and when he's in the message he says four weeks ago i was in jcpenney so a month previous so somewhere a month somewhere around a month previous he has this experience in jcpenney's but then when he comes to the message in the evening he that's in you he's going to start talking about his experience during a storm in colorado and that storm we know took place on october 24th because it was the day after his anniversary because on his anniversary he went down to the city they were going to get more rations because the storm was coming and he called his wife to to wish her a happy anniversary but she wasn't there so he called another sister and he asked that sister to wish her a happy anniversary how do you like that amen some things we just hear we don't preach we don't preach at this doctrine and we just hear it and say amen but that would have been october 24th which would have been 17 days prior to preaching this so these two experiences the prophet of god would have had roughly two weeks apart so he would have this experience in jcpenney's when he sees hell upon earth then approximately two weeks later he's going to be in colorado on a hunting trip when a storm is coming in and we know the story so well but but but he relates it again and he tells this is actually the first time that he tells this story in public and it just it happened roughly two weeks before uh this day and he's telling them that they were in the storm and how bad the blizzards were and how it's instant death they get caught out in one and he told everybody it was with him you make a beeline straight for the camp when the first snowflakes fall and and all of a sudden the storm rolls in and he finds himself in the storm and it's raining sleeting and snow's falling and he goes to get down off of the mountain like he told everybody else to do and a voice speaks to him says go back where you came from and the prophet of god doubts the voice i'm so glad he was honest how many times has god spoke to us and we questioned whether that was me or god that's what brother branham was doing he was questioning he said could that just be me so he sat down and he ate a sandwich and after he ate the sandwich said okay now i feel better i'm gonna go back to camp and the voice came again go back where you came from and he said go back into that storm it's death but he said i've learned by now to always obey the lord so he went back into the storm and as he got back up there the lord spoke to him and told him to speak and whatever he said would come to pass and he spoke and he said storm i resent your coming and i command you to go back where you came from and sun to come out and shine for four days till our hunting trip is over and he says it this way and he that is in you paragraph 104 he said speak to those winds in that storm and it'll go away now this bible lays before me which my life is in that i raised up i said i do not doubt your voice lord i said cloud snow rain sleet i resist your coming in the name of the lord jesus christ go back to your places i say that the sun must come out and immediately shine for four days till our hunting trip is over and leave and i leave with my brethren it was just gushing just and she's making the sound so like that and it just started to go and it just started going whoosh and then it went and it stopped what was that at the same time hell was spilling upon earth there was a man born in sin that could speak the nature of the way adam did that could speak to the storm the same way jesus christ did when he was in flesh and he would put one foot on the bow of the boat and he would cry peace be still and the wind and the waves obeyed him now we have a son of god that has come to a fullness of redemption where he's come back to all that adam lost and he can stand there on the mountain that day when god gives him permission and he can speak to the storm he wasn't repeating what god told him to say he was saying what he wanted to say he had control over nature amen god told him to ask for what he wanted god told him to speak and he spoke and he gave details go back where you came from son come out shine for four days and nature obeyed the voice of a man not a virgin born man but a sin born man that had come into his redemption and at the same time hell is upon earth there is an adopted restored son of god upon earth again amen that has the restored power of the spoken word and control over nature amen it it shows that there's nothing that the devil can do that can outdo what god is doing there is no time that the devil is over overpowering god amen if this level goes to here rest assured this level is above that amen when you see things in the world go chaotic amen and you see the devil on the rampage and sin increasing by droves and chaos breaking out amen it doesn't matter what power is climbing here it never can outdo this power over here the same time hell spilled upon the earth there was a gateway where heaven could spill out upon the earth he says in god's provided place of worship but he promised just before just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in sodom when a man come down in human form three of them two angels and god himself that was god the bible said it was now he come down he manifest himself there by turning his back to the tent where sarah was and told abraham what sarah was thinking in the tents that right now jesus himself at the day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through the baptism of the holy ghost or the pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man that when the when husband and wife will be the same self persons god will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at you realize the prophet of god had so many experiences and so many things that the lord did through him and he would come and share those on tapes so that we would have those those we call them stories those experiences with the lord but if you listen to the brother branham preaching the prophet of god never pends that to himself and he never limits it to him as the prophet of god is preaching especially as he's moving on in his ministry he is constantly trying to get the people to believe it for themselves he he he's constantly he'll get to the end of services and say things like now you all believe you have god in you you lay hands on one another he wasn't wanting to come to another prayer line he he come to the end of a service and he didn't want you know he would give a manifestation to build faith amen he would use his gift to build the people's faith he would have a prayer line he would have discernment amen and he said those things were to bring people's faith higher so that they could believe then after he would he would operate in this gift in the office that god put him in amen and and get the faith to a level he says now you're believers you believe that christ dwells in you that you have the holy ghost now you lay hands on one another he didn't want them amen he didn't want them dependent on coming to him he didn't want them dependent on coming to him to standing in his presence to having his hands laid on them he wanted to realize that what's on the platform is in you amen the his ministry would have failed if when he left the earth if everything would have went with him that would have been a failure of the ministry he was here to demonstrate that the headship is here he was here to demonstrate that christ is here he was here to show that christ is back in his church again the headship is here the son of man ministry jesus christ itself is present and he did that amen and god lifted that office and that word up and waved it for before the people so that you could see that christ is here but he told us that the wave sheath amen was the first part of the fruit of the harvest of the field to come to maturity testifying that the rest of the field will come to maturity you know there was testimonies of of different brethren you listen to testimonies on a testimony of brother billy paul and one of the testimonies that billy paul gave he makes a statement i don't remember exactly how he worded it but it just comes to my mind now the statement somehow where he says something like no matter what the situation was my dad was always in control and and you you see him looking at that and you see there's a man who amen he obviously had his own struggles he had his own things that he had to overcome in himself but the perspective from his son who traveled so much with him was he was always under control because i would put it this way he knew who he was he had a revelation of who he was and what he was on earth for and that god was with him and i don't want my children to have a testimony of me that dad was always out of control every time the buzzer went off he panicked i can tell you i'm not always done real well at that i've panicked i've been scared i've made uh quick decisions poor decisions out of fear out of anxiety i've spoke things that were not faith amen i've done all of those things but i don't want to live that way amen i want to live by revelation of the message of the hour not by the dictates of my emotion and fears and external circumstances i don't want every time the buzzer goes off to panic amen there's nothing in this world to panic about i could say that every day all day long i could put that in a recording and you put it on your phone and you could play it back to yourself 10 times a day and i could play it to myself we need to remember this at all times no man can pluck you out of my hand i'll be with you into the end of the world there is nothing to panic about amen we could take the voice of the prophet and and the quotes of the scriptures and put them on a reel and play them over and over and over again so that we realize nothing no diagnosis from a doctor no government situation no financial situation nothing nothing nothing is outside of god's knowledge of what he's doing in my life nothing is to destroy me everything is to prove me when we when we begin to to let revelation dictate our response and not our human emotion we begin to respond completely different to situations now all of a sudden when when trouble comes our way amen all of a sudden we begin to say wow i can't wait to see what god will do next all right this is only here to prove that i believe god and i believe you god i mean if we would if if we could just uh reprogram ourselves that's what the word is doing it's reprogramming us if we could just get to where our initial response in the face of trouble is this is here to prove that i believe god then i guarantee our next response would be much different this is only here to prove that i believe god and the next thing we would do is be like all right i believe you god i'm not going to run scared i'm not going to panic i'm not i'm not going to throw away my confession i'm not going to do any of those things but i'm going to stand here with the same thing that i confessed on sunday and the same thing i confessed last time you delivered me i'm going to confess it again today he says in the in the message adoption from 1960 said bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on thin ice that makes me nervous i'm not a thin ice kind of guy kind of walking out on thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what i think to a complete understanding positionally of what we are in christ jesus so brother bam's coming to the adoption in adoption he's he's really laying out the church ages as the body has been built over seven church ages coming to the capping off which will be the adoption of the church which is when christ the headstone will come to the church and be unified with it and bring it into adoption positional placing and brother bam's teaching this to want so the church would know its position in christ but teaching pla i'm sorry he said a complete understanding positionally of what we are in christ jesus and sometimes i think that preaching is a wonderful thing but i believe sometimes brother bieler that teaching goes beyond that especially to the church now preaching usually catches the center brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is and he can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are well what can we have that's greater than faith nothing there's nothing that we can have that's greater than faith gifts will fail is that right tongues they shall cease uh gifts will fail all things will fail away but faith will never fail so teaching places a man positionally what he is so the teaching listen real bible teaching is not so that you understand like the order of scriptures and the correct teaching on a certain doctrine real bible teaching tells you what your position is that's real bible teaching bible real bible teaching what paul was doing to the church amen he was positioning the church amen he was telling them what their position in christ is paul wasn't saying now you remember uh way back when moses said that uh the the uh you know the scholars are saying this but they got the wrong translation of the wrong hebrew word the real translation of that hebrew word is xyz and that's what it means that's not bible teaching that's intellectual exercises but real bible teaching is not you know learning the chronology of the bible amen and learning all the proper greek and understand no real bible teaching will take the believer and position them in christ and establish them in the word so that they know who they are what they are that's real teaching but teaching places a man positionally what he is and he can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are so we can never rightly have faith until we get the good bible teaching that brings us into our position amen that's what the opening of the seals that's what the preaching and to the bride after the seals that's what it was all about if you look at the ministry of brother branham amen he positioned amen the church ages he positioned amen the messengers he positioned the whole history from the time of christ all the way to his day he got everything in position is that right so that he could position the bride he had to lay it all out this was this and this was this and this was it so there's no confusion where we're at amen as everything was positioned the new testament was positioned the doctrines were positioned amen the church ages were positioned everything was positioned so that he could come at the time of the opening of the seals and say in the first seal i'm now going to call you bride what was he doing he was positioning the church this isn't church age anymore and this isn't church anymore because church was a mixed multitude amen church was two vines amen that's what he showed through the church ages so i'm not any longer calling you church because this isn't for two vines but i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand i have to position you so you'll understand what i'm teaching you because if he hadn't called them bride and he called them church amen the things that he was teaching would have been put to the future but he had to position them so that they could understand what he's teaching them and if you look at the ministry from that point on he was preaching to the bride amen he was establishing the bride he was preaching present truth he was showing the bride coming of christ he was showing the wheat had come back into the life again they were showing he was showing amen the position of the bride from then on that was good bible teaching so i want to say this again you could never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are that's why you can know what brother branham is it won't give you the right faith you can know that there'll be an end time bribe but that doesn't give and tell you until the word places you positionally and what you are in christ then you have the faith now brother branham says in the message perfect faith said jesus had perfect faith he had it and he came because he was the word and i want you to catch this statement really close and you become the word he repeats it you become the word as you receive the word you become the word as you receive the word this is why we cannot say you know 20 years ago i come to the message i believe that god sent a prophet and i'm fine for life that's all i needed no the word that he's opening is still positioning us it's still giving us faith amen faith is coming by by the revealing of the word what is the revelation of the word doing it's positioning the bride amen in christ and that is bringing a greater faith in a greater faith in a greater faith amen and that's why we have to walk in the light as he is in the light it takes the revelation of the word and so you become the word as you receive the word and god is constantly unveiling himself he is the word and as we receive that we're becoming the word our faith is increasing we're becoming more like christ not less like christ so that's why it's important to constantly feed on the word constantly be in this message talk about these things amen listen to the preaching of the word listen to the tapes read the books constantly constantly constantly because you become the word as you receive the word but if you don't know what the word is if you don't know what the message is saying how do you become the word what are you receiving if you're not receiving the revelation of the word i mean we can say all kinds of things i'm receiving the word but what word are you receiving amen are you receiving the word that's establishing the bride in this day bringing faith are we are we just saying i'm receiving the word god sent a prophet and there'll be a bride but what about you amen where are you at today what's going on now amen what is god revealed about you what's your position sometimes i wonder if our lack of faith sometimes is our lack of being positioned in the word so we're always looking for something to bolster our faith now i'm gonna i'm gonna say this because brother branham taught it you know he said the real gentile way is to believe the word and accept it but so many times we're looking for something to bolster our faith and that's not always wrong there's scriptures for these things but we always want you know a gift a display something but god wants his bride to come to a reliance upon his word to where she says lord you promised this i'm taking you at your word and i'm going to believe it the way the centurion man did lord i'm not even worthy that you come in my house just speak the words and just look and say lord you've already spoken in your word i take you at your word i believe it see if we come into a proper uh position and understanding we have faith faith to what faith to take the word faith to believe all the word for our day and the message recognizing your day and its message so now i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride is that right the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward so i want to see how the power of god will put the power of god will put the people in the bride how i'll wait till a wind rushes through the church but he said the power of god how will the power of god be made manifest how will the power of god be felt how will the power of god be realized because the power of god it is the power of god that will put the people in the bride the world forces this way the world forces that way but god forces upward spirit of god which is the word of god you caught that oh we want the spirit of god to move then you need the word of god moving is that right if you want the spirit of god to move in our midst the word of god has to be moving in our midst because the word and the spirit are the same thing the spirit of god which is the word of god my word of spirit and life will put the bride in her place what will put the people in the bride what will put the bride in her place what is this great power it's the revelation of the word that's been revealed in this day will put the people in the bride remember the bride's revival was the restoration of the word the bride's revival wasn't uh it wasn't a dynamic outpouring that had uh all kinds of manifestations the bride's revival was the restoration of the word the word coming back to the church is the bride's revival and that word will put the people back in the bride all right the word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ will put her in her place well to put her in her place her revelation of this word will put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force did drive israel to the homeland the national forces of the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride and to glory out of it o people recognize your day as jesus warned you the sign of sodom and the church conditions of this day he goes on and christ is the mystery of god reveal and say what is it not them people the headship in the body has become one has become one unit it's god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer twain they are one god in this church is one christ in you god's great revelation what's god's great revelation the mystery god revealed christ in you the hope of glory christ in you god's great revelation glory to god even bearing his name his name is jesus the anointed the reason he is called jesus he is the anointed it's the anointed body of christ proving manifesting god like that body did and that body redeemed every of these bodies and through there god works his threefold manifestation going to the kingdom now brother branham is going to make a statement here in christ is the mystery of god revealed and it's a statement that has stumbled many many people amen but it's i just want to go on record on saying it's nothing but the truth he said the church is the blood of christ by the spirit i mean that stumbles a lot of people amen because we have denominational ideas of things amen we have physical ideas of physical blood on a physical cross and that was there that was the price that was paid for our redemption but the prophet of god said the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood what was released when the blood cell was broken the life was released where did the life go the life now could come back into the people amen so the the spirit is the life amen the life was in the blood and now the church becomes the blood by the spirit because the life is in the blood showing one that the life of the blood is in the bride he said the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood where else is the life the head ship the head is in the body where is the life where is the spirit where did that mighty angel go when he came down the headship the word christ himself the the son of man it's in the body in the bride that life is in the bride is in the church that's the baptism of the holy ghost that baptizes us unto his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word you see brother branham is preaching christ is the mystery of god or no he's preaching souls that are in prison now asking could it be all over it will be one day when that last one comes in it'll be all over and then that evening he comes and he preaches he that is in you he that is in you man who's in you the life the life of the blood is in you amen as as long as the bride is here until that last predestinated seed is is called and sealed into the body as long as the bride is here there's life available friends there's blood here there's something here because christ is here where is he at he's on his throne his throne is your heart he's here amen there's something for the people because the bride is here and we know that when the bride goes up amen the spirit of god leaves for the gentiles so so the answer to the question is he that is in you amen in the first seal he says for the mystery of iniquity does already work deceivers you see deceiving the people off into something he's reading a scripture and he says the mystery of iniquity does all the word already work and he injects the statement deceivers deceiving the people off into something now he's gonna he's gonna make he's going back to the scripture and he's going to inject comments so i'll try to keep it squared away now he goes back to the scripture only he he injects god so you know that he's talking about that letteth will let until he this is another he be taken out of the way so he that letteth which which means hinder or to hold back that's holding back this antichrist that's holding back amen all of all of the destruction that's coming upon the earth through the tribulation who's holding it back amen he will hold back we'll let he that now let us will let until he be taken out of the way so there's two he's he that now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way so he is somebody that's holding it back and he will hold it back until he's taken out of the way but listen to how brother benham describes these two he's he only he god that led us will let until he the church christ the bride be taken out of the way amen greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world amen he god that's holding it back will hold it back till he the church christ the bride be taken out of the way your presence is life amen your presence on this earth is holding a door open for the gentiles there is life the church is the blood by the spirit because the life is in the blood amen there's something here there's mercy here there's opportunity here greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world is hell here then heaven is here also and heaven is here in a greater force than hell how do you know heaven's here because the fullness of the word is here and brother bam told us hell is consisted of the word if the word has come heaven has come down where is heaven come down well i ask you where was hell at hell was manifest in people and j.c penney's all of a sudden the manifestation of hell required people to man it wasn't the clothes racks in jc penney's it wasn't the color of the wall it wasn't the lighting in jcpenney it was people who were anointed with demon spirits from hell they were manifesting the regions of the lost they were manifesting the regions of hell where was hell it was in the people so where will heaven be in the people amen there's two forces facing off but they're working in humanity in humankind in people and one is heaven which is in the bride and one is hell which is upon the people so greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world it was on the same and souls that are imprisoned now he comes down to the end of souls in prison now and he tells this story which i thought was really really interesting he said there was a man going along there one day just at the time for the tides to come in so the story was like in ireland or something he's walking along the coast and there's cliffs there and he was walking along at the time for the tides to come in and there was a noble man who lived on the hill that knowed these tides and he knowed the time of day that the tides were supposed to come he knowed what time the tide set in the guy didn't care what time he was one of those know-it-alls he's he had his own idea he was an athletic man smart intelligent fellow but he just didn't know the time of the time he didn't know the country he didn't know the time the signs was right then the moon had dropped its back from the earth now listen to what he says and when god ever drops his spirit from the earth brother she's gone it's all over that moon would ever move out of its place if that moon would ever move out of this place the waters would cover the earth like it was when the god started it in genesis 1. but the moon set there and when it just even turns its head the tides start running in brother man's talking about the tides that are going to come in and destroy this man because there was somebody there that knew the the position of the moon the tides were coming in and he said this moon ever moves out of its position what's the moon a type of the bride amen you don't know what your presence is on this earth we think things are happening to us and happening all around us and and sometimes we can feel like my life is out of control you have no idea what your presence is doing for this world because when the moon moves out of position and drops over to the drops out of the way then the floods will cover the earth i'm not talking physical i'm talking spiritual brother brahma said in the in the laodicean church age out of the church age book he said a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in the last day there was again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come that is our call come the spirit and the bride say come where is the spirit in the bride what is that the life how did it come the restoration of the word the headship christ himself is connected with his body in his body his bride where is the life of christ in the body we're trying to get people to christ but christ is here he's the revelation of the word in this hour connected with a body of believers upon this earth we don't realize sometimes what we are the the the prophet came and he showed it every which way he could show it trying to get us to realize what we are to accept it to receive it because you become the word as you receive the word we're here holding back hell opportunities of salvation are here because the life of the word is here the hell would love to take over but it cannot because you're here you think of that on a grand scale what what what life is connected to human vessels on this earth and what effect it's having upon the whole earth we know that the world is responding to the maturity of the bride because the earth is groaning in travail for the manifestations of the son of god well listen brother benham taught us in birth pains that as it gets closer to delivery the contractions get tighter and more intense and i would like to say the contractions are tighter and more intense earthquakes and pestilence and wars and all kinds of rumors and disasters of all kind the the the the birth pains are getting more intense and closer together in frequency what's that mean the earth is getting ready to burst forth on bright new earth for a millennium well if that's the case where is your maturity what level is the bride coming to where what is she beginning to manifest she must be coming into a fuller manifestation a greater revelation because the earth is responding to her maturity because the earth can't get to a millennium until the bride amen gets lifted off before the cleansing so the word the revelation of the word the teaching the prophet gave us is putting us in position and that position is a position that's stemming back the lie of the devil that's holding back the full force of hell heaven is here amen mercy is still here there's an opportunity for salvation as far as we know it's still here why because the blood the churches the blood by the spirit you're carrying the word carrying the spirit carrying the line and offering it to whosoever will amen there's so many things in this world we feel like we can't do anything about them there's troubles on every sign and people around us that are in trouble and we feel like what can i do to help who am i what what can i change and we don't realize because when we make statements like that what we're doing is taking ourselves out of the position god put us in and putting ourselves down in common humanity where we can't do anything well the truth is we in ourselves can't do anything but we are not just ourselves there's another life with us amen there's the life of christ dwelling in us amen and we can take our faith in who we are in our position and go to the lord and say lord amen i believe you've called me here for a reason amen and i see hell moving in on this individual and i want to push it back in the name of jesus christ i see this coming to my family i see this coming my way and god i want to take my position by the word and all the word that you've given to me i believe is for me and for this hour and i push back now in the name of jesus christ you don't know what you are sometimes we just don't know what we are if we just could keep in the forefront of our mind what we are who we are and who this is that's living in us we would stop throwing our hands up and saying i don't know well you know what you don't have to know the one in you knows i don't have a figure you don't have to have it figured out the one inside of you has it figured out so don't go losing your mind stay connected to christ he's in you he's in control nothing's out of kilter the cog is turning just right on time everything's working perfect according to god's plan don't lose faith hold fast when you've got loved ones that you love listen where's the life at it's in you say god i believe the life is in me and i want them lord i want them to be saved i want them to see this message pray pray with faith amen pray and believe pray with your position pray as the bride of jesus christ pray amen pray as the temple that's templing christ pray as the habitation of god pray as one who's connected with god and has god living on the inside not to a god a million miles away that hopefully will hear me and hopefully be kind and hopefully answer don't pray like that friends those prayers they leave us more devastated usually at the end but let's pray to the one that's inside and let's pray according to the position he put us in say lord you called me i didn't call myself you've called me to be your bride you've called me lord you you're living inside of me and i believe that all of this word is for me and i'm not going to back down and i'm not going to run afraid and i'm not going to let the devil scare me because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world brother branham comes to the end of this message that he preaches that evening in november he that is in you and it's astounding as he begins to pray that he wanted to have prayer for the sick so he starts discerning he didn't pass out prayer cards he starts discerning but he comes to this statement and it just thrilled my heart because of the way i was meditating he said now the lady i don't know but god knows the woman and he was talking to a woman that was in the back of the church he said now have you got something in your pocket a little handkerchief or something there all right when you sit down she was just standing up in the back he said you're there and she stood up in the back and he told her trouble and you can hear on the tape she says yes that's it that's right it was for her father and she didn't come to the front he didn't lay hands on her he says you back there he said when you sit down put your hands on that handkerchief and don't doubt and he that's in you is greater he that's killing your daddy what did brother branham want to demonstrate he that's in you he that's in you he that's in you brother man say not he that's in me amen god was in him of course we saw it we recognized it it was instrumental to recognize where god was working so that he could be the wave chief so that we would have confidence that it's the same god in us we don't have to have an office of profit we don't have to repeat everything he did but the same goddess there is the same god that's here friends and brother abraham didn't call a prayer line in the mind of he that is in you so that he could lay hands on everybody he he showed the sign of the messiah he showed the sermon but he told this woman amen don't come see me after church i'll give you a prayer cloth he said do you've got you had a pocketbook do you have a handkerchief or something in your pocketbook and she said yes he said when you sit down back there you lay your hand on it and don't doubt and he that's in you is greater that he that's killing your daddy believe with all your heart so shall it be as you believe when sickness strikes your house don't wait for sunday or wednesday he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world now don't also don't be afraid to come up for prayer because if during the preaching of the word god strikes your heart that word and says go up for prayer then you obey the spirit of god don't be afraid to come for prayer but this is not the only place where god answers prayer it's not the only way in which he heals his children greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world believe for god lay your hands on one another lay your hands on your children on your wife amen pray for one another believe the word you may not even be able to get to where you can lay hands on a brother or sister you may be away and your family remember calls and another family member is sick and you can say lord the same one who healed the servant of the centurion is the same one that can heal my child my family member my this or that if i have the same kind of faith and lord i believe amen that you have the authority to heal that and in the name of jesus christ i ask that you deliver this this this and that believe friends believe in who you are believe in who he's made you amen you haven't made yourself anything you never called yourself you didn't give yourself a revelation amen he did you didn't ask anybody to start preaching on the bride amen god called a man amen all the way back amen in the 30s and that man began preaching and he called him to be a prophet of the age and he gave him the revelation of the seven seals and began to teach about the bride you never asked anybody to preach on the bride you never asked brother ben would say call me bride i wasn't even alive when he preached the first seal but on tape when i hear him say i'll call you bride he is calling me bride me personally to me i believe it that way i wasn't even lying i didn't ask him to say that but when he said it i believed it i didn't even ask to believe it i just believed it i didn't call myself i didn't reveal the message to myself i didn't god did that to me god did that to you why can't we believe in what he has called us to be what are we called to be him on this earth because as he is so are ye on the earth the headship is in the body the life is in the body he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world aren't you happy to be alive today let's all stand if musicians will come oh i think we could hear this preaching once a week i think it would help us we need to remember these things and you know greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world but so is greater that's in your brother and your sister that he's in the world you know how sometimes you just need a little something you're struggling and you just need a little help and you'll ask somebody will you lay hands on me and pray for me because i have confidence god is in you i don't think that disappoints god any i think that's the right kind of revelation that we know who our brothers and sisters are that we know where the dwelling place of almighty god is and when we recognize it i think it pleases our father amen greater is he this world according to prophecy will get more chaotic what we'll see and how much and in what way those things are up for debate we can sit around and we can talk about those for hours and we'll probably all be a little bit wrong or maybe a whole lot wrong but we know that birth pains will increase in intensity and get closer together we know that that more worlds will break out and pestilence and earthquakes and all these other natural disasters they're not going to stop friends we don't know how close it'll come to our home we don't know how much we'll actually see how much we'll experience it could be a little it could be a lot it could be somewhere in between but the same revelation holds throughout all he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world nothing will take you out of his hands and he will never leave you nor forsake you don't let these things rob us of our faith but in the midst of trials recognize god is allowing the devil to test my faith so i want the devil to hear loud and clear what i believe not not what's happening to me why i can't even believe i don't want the devil to hear that i want the devil to hear god this is a hard trial but i believe it's for your good and i believe that when i'm tried i shall come forth as gold oh praise god i still believe you god i still believe i'm in your hands i still believe the word is true that's what i want the devil to hear and i want to resist the devil and he'll flee i want to stop crying and stop complaining and stop panicking god help me to stop and let me be a manifested son of god amen that will not let my emotions run me but i will stop in the midst of a trial and say nothing's changed between me and god his word hasn't changed his idea hasn't shifted everything's fine god help us and i believe if we as a body of believers as the bride of jesus christ if we can take that attitude who knows what hardships are coming but people will recognize that there's something different in you than the rest of the world that's right greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you we thank you lord for your wonderful word for the truth that you've given us in this hour oh god how you've manifested so powerfully lord so that we would have no room to doubt god forgive us for our fears lord and our anxieties and our nervousness god we want to lay that at your feet and repent of it lord it's just human emotion lord but we weren't given human emotion to rule us we were given the word to rule over us i wasn't told to yield to human emotion father but you told me to yield and surrender to your word god help me help me god grant me greater revelation that i might receive your word that i might have faith god that i might believe all that you've given for me to believe and that faith in me would conquer god i acknowledge your truth i believe it to be true what you said about me is true where you're dwelling is true god i just commit myself into your hands again and say you know best what you do is perfect i'm just here to manifest you lord have your way through each one of us forgive us lord for our failings forgive us for our wonderings and complainings take all that away from us now bring us into a higher level of faith so that we know who we are and what we are what we're called to in this last day help us to make that glorious stand standing against all the wiles of the devil and all the fiery darts and all the tricks and all the traps help us to stand against it all lord that was to stand upon your word and believe it lord god may we fight with the word in the word only may we trust in the word and your word only may that word manifest through each one of us god i pray you would take our lives and use it to attract the rest of your seed lord there's any more out there lord i pray that you draw them in by the light the light and the life that we live god may they come to you be connected to you so that every predestinated seed would find their way home or we just trust in you we give ourselves to you knowing that you do all things well and all things work together for good lord we trust you have your way with us lord let us see with a clearer vision moving forward and help us to understand with a greater comprehension as we move forward in jesus christ's name we pray amen then god bless your friends [Music] so and many souls [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music]
