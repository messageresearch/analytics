TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazer. And I wonder how could he love me, a sinner, condemned unclean. But how marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. For me it was in the garden. He prayed not my will but thine. He had no tears for his own reap but sweat drops of blood for mine. Oh how marvelous, how wonderful and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. In pity, the angels beheld him and came from the world of light to comfort him in the sorrow he bore for my soul that night. Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. He took my sins and my sorrows and made them his very own. He bore the burden to Calary. He suffered and died alone. Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my soul shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. When with the ransom in glory, his face at last I see will be my joy through the ages to sing of his love for me. Oh, how how wonderful my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. Oh, how marvelous, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They will mount up with wings as an eagle. They will run and not be weery. They will walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. Oh teach me Lord to wait. Down on my knees till your own good time. You'll answer my please. Teach me not to rely on what others do, but to wait in prayer for an answer from you. Oh, they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They will mount up with wings as an eagle. They will run and not be weery. They will walk and not faint. Oh, teach me Lord.

It's certainly good to be here with you tonight. Amen. Before we go to prayer, I just want to give you an update on um brother Emanuel. I just spoke with him this morning. Uh he met with the surgeon and they've scheduled his surgery for Thursday for tomorrow. So we want to remember him in prayer. He said the surgery is Thursday tomorrow and they expect a six-w week recovery. And so we just want to pray that God will undertake for our brother and deliver him from this. And so let's just bow our heads together and pray. Dear heavenly father, we thank you Lord Jesus for the privilege of being here and God for us it's may it never become a tradition Lord God in the human side we get into routines we get into patterns Lord we're routine creatures but when we come here Lord may we come here deliberately intentional with gratitude in our hearts and may we remind ourselves of how privileged we are to be here Lord what a special time what a special place to be able to gather with your children to hear your word preached and God may may you come on the scene Lord as you promised to do through the preaching of the word wherever two or three are gathered would you be in our midst Lord and would you break the bread of life for us tonight God I pray that as we're gathered Lord we want to lift to you our brother Emanuel Sabasu Lord he's in such a difficult situation with his back and with a degenerative disc Lord that's herniated and a pinched nerve and severe pain and and Lord, the doctors only know to operate, Lord, and they're going forward the best they know how. But God, we're praying that you would intervene for our brother, that you would deliver him, Lord. God, we know your prophet told us that you have many ways of healing, through surgery, through medicine, through music, Lord, through the power of you coming on the scene and supernaturally delivering. Lord, we're not dictating to you how you deliver our brother, but we are asking that by your stripes, Brother Emanuel was already healed. And we pray that it would come into manifestation for our brother, Lord, that you would deliver him, Lord. That you would, Lord, we know that he could he could wake up in the morning and not need the surgery, Lord. We would rejoice in that. But if you choose to move forward and use the hands of a doctor, I pray you would anoint those hands. Lord, may it be supernatural what takes place in the operating room. And Lord, however, but I pray for a complete total victory and deliverance for our brother. May he be freed from this problem in his back. And may this be a permanent solution, a permanent healing for our brother. I pray that you would diminish his pain, Lord. That you would help the recovery process that would go much faster than expected. And may you just supernaturally show yourself from beginning to end on behalf of our brother. May the testimony come back of wonderful things that you have done. pray you be with sister Mimi and the rest of the family and Lord may you just undertake for them all and God for us tonight that are here Lord to hear from you God what we need more than anything in this life is revelation on your word your prophet told us that Lord and you've provided the Isab in this hour Lord the message of the hour the revealing of the word and God may you come and apply that in our eyes and open our eyes open the eyes of our understanding that we might have the spirit of revelation and understanding to see what it is you're trying to show us, Lord. What you want us to see in this hour. And Lord, I pray you'd take these lips of mine under your control and speak your words. Stop me from saying the wrong thing. Help me, Lord, to release myself to your spirit that you might use me to speak the right things, Lord. For we surrender to your way. And we come to worship you. And we want you to have preeminence among us. Bless us now, we pray, God, as we look into your word. in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you. We're going to let you have your seats for just a minute. Amen. I just wanted to u uh remind you, thank you, musicians. God bless you. Uh just wanted to remind you that we are two weeks from tomorrow from retreat. I don't know if that shocks you, but it shocks me. Brother Jonathan Bumgardner said it to me out in the forer and I'm thinking, "Oh, we're three or four weeks away." He says, "No, we're two weeks from tomorrow, 15 days." I said, "Oh, God." Praise God. Amen. I'm looking forward to it. I'm excited. There was an information packet that went out today. So, we just want to remind you that 2 weeks from tomorrow, uh we'll meet over there. 5:00 p.m. is when we are allowed to get in uh to the the accommodations and the orientation service will start at 7 over there. Want to remind you also that there won't be any ser uh any supper served over there. So, please eat before you get there. Also, there's new information and the registration information, a new map and all the menus and everything that you need. Also, we already sent it out today, but there needs to be a correction because there was a uh there was a conflict between some of the breakout sessions. So, that will change. We're going to flop the two for Friday and Saturday meetings will reverse. But when you get the update, you'll see that. Also, there's some signup sheets out in the foyer on the welcome desk for those who want to participate in some of the activities. uh just uh ask that you be signed up by the 13th. So we are very much looking forward to that. Again, we will have brother Daniel White with us. His wife will be here and also his mother's coming along with him. So it'll be nice to meet her as well. So we're looking forward to having a good time together. Also appreciate brother Denny Delmundo for being here on Sunday. Had a good service. I got to listen to it. It was it was nice. I'm glad I wasn't here while he said all those things. It was much easier to listen while driving, but we appreciate brother Danny and we're so thankful that he could relax and the atmosphere was good and we could tell that he was relaxed. So, we appreciate all of you pulling on the gift and we had a wonderful time up in Connecticut to see Brother Wesley and Sister Anne Godfrey. They're now both official have the same last name. They had a really nice wedding. I got a couple pictures if we bring them up on the overhead. I just wanted to share a couple pictures with you. They had a really nice wedding and here's the happy couple. We'll see him here in a little over a week and then we'll have the reception here on the 20th for them. So, we're looking forward to that. So, uh yeah, like I said, it was a privilege to be there and and uh we couldn't fly back in time for the services and Sunday wasn't going to work, so my wife and I decided to stay over and visit Brother Craig Brewer's church. And so, Brother Craig and Sister Anna were there. So, we got to talk to them and we were really excited to to see them and connect again after so many years. Uh, and so we had a wonderful fellowship. But then I asked brother Craig, I said, 'Are you preaching in the morning? Because I was excited to sit and hear him preach again. He said, 'N no, brother Roshan Massie is preaching. And I one of my one of my good friends, brother Rashan. So that was an extra treat. So here's a picture of the three of us and the four of the church afterwards. So I was a total surprise. And brother Rashan had let me know he's in the States and wanted to come by. But the only time he could come by here was the time my family and I were on vacation. And I told him, "We're just going to have to miss you this year." But God was good to us. Amen. And he preached a wonderful message. Amen. It was quite a blessing. And so, we had a really good time with them. And Brother Craig and Sister Anna send their greetings to everyone. They wanted us to tell everybody hello and they love you and think of you all. And so, we had a we had a great time. Amen. So, thank you for praying for us. Amen. Let's all stand together. We got to see Josiah and Samuel and Aaliyah, and they're all growing up. Brother Josiah was the song leader. I thought, "There's no way. You're just a little bitty boy, but he's taller than his dad now. He's 17 years old. He's helping there." And guess what? Samuel's taller than his mom now. He's shooting up like a like a weed and he believes he's going to overtake his brother. So, uh, it was good to see them. And what was really nice too is they usually have two services on Sunday, but they cancelled the second service because the brother Rashan was there and they had a fellowship dinner and their fellowship hall and so we got to stay and visit with everybody and get to meet their congregation. So that was really a wonderful time. So we felt like God really blessed us with that. That was good. Amen. Let's get into our subject for tonight, the Mount Zion showdown. Amen. And if you'll turn with your Bibles to Psalms 125. Let's turn to Psalms 125. And just want to say God bless you to the Quinlands. It's good to have brother Michael and Sister Marian here again with us. We appreciate seeing you again. Amen. It's always a privilege. Let's look at Psalms 125. We're going to read verse one and verse two. They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth forever. I love that. Not because we're strong, not because we're powerful, not but because we trust in the Lord. And the Lord won't fail. &gt;&gt; They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth forever. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth, even forever. Amen. God bless you as you take your seats. Amen. God is certainly good. Uh as you can tell from the title, we're continuing on from this message from Pick Up Your Pen and Write. Uh the the booklet that we passed out. We're going to take a couple excerpts from that, but I have them on the overhead. And so I I I've been enjoying this study. I've been enjoying looking into this message and it's hard to get away from it. There's so much there. There's so much that God was trying to get through to the church that he wanted us to understand in this transition time that the prophet found himself in coming out of the church ages between the former reign and the latter reign and all of these things now that we understand better than we did before. And we see this transition, this message that God was trying to get over to the church. And so, it's been fun to look at it. But in here he mentions the Mount Zion showdown. But before that I want to just in review read this little portion here. Says now I want you to be very careful here and see this. God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled. It has to be for it is a spiritquickened word of God spoken by the prophet Malachi. Jesus referred to it. It is just before Christ comes the second time. By the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled. The gentile dispensation will be in its last church age. When that messenger of Mal Malachi comes, he will be right with the word. He will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation. He will start at the serpent seat and carry on to the messenger and the latter reign. Amen. So, we had so much fun with this statement last Wednesday when we talked about the former and latter rain and realized that that the latter rain was a revival. And during the first revival, he was sewing the seeds, amen, of all the truths that was lost through the church ages. But but there was going to come another rain, another revival that was going to be the harvest rain. Amen. And brother Brandham told us that we're waiting what we're waiting for is the latter rain. And he says, "We've sewed." Amen. There's been enough moisture to get it to come, but we swed the seed. Watch what comes. He said, "There's been denominational seed sown and Pentecostal seed swing." He said, "But the word's been sown." He said, "And watch what comes forth now. And now there's going to come a latter rain. And he called it the harvest rain. And it's the final rain, the final revival, the final uh spiritual falling. Amen. That's going to bring the the the final bit to bring that plant, the final harvest maturity. And it's going to be the initiation of the harvest cycle or the harvest season or the harvest time. Brother Bam uses all these terms but but there's a place in the message where he called the harvest the harvest rain rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; So the latter rain is the harvest rain and the harvest rain is rapturing faith and rapturing faith amen comes amen at the opening of the seals at the revelation of the seven thunders. &gt;&gt; So we know that he swed hey listen he he took the Bible he he he took the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelations. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he started at the serpent seed and carried on to the messenger in the latter rain. Did he? Amen. Because he preached the seven seals, the revelations. Amen. The seven thunders, which are the revelations contained in the seven seals, which brings rapturing faith, which brings the harvest rain, which brings the latter rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we just just wanted to bring us up to speed from what we talked about last time. Now, let's get into the Mount Zion showdown. back in spoken word is the original seed. He says, "See now why I have been so zealous of the kind of seed that I planted for the body." The rain is going to fall pretty soon now. I mean, the real rain. And that rain, he means revival. And it's got to have seed to follow. And I hope I live to see it. Do you understand now? It will be the living word as it was at the beginning. The spoken word of God have his power for it is in him, in his own body, working his own way. look to the promises that God gave his body. Now, we're coming to something. We're coming to Mount Zion. Now, so as he talking about this is this is in spoken word as the original seed. He's talking about this coming to the body. And I just want to highlight a couple things for you if I can. He says it'll be the living word as it was in the beginning, the spoken word of God. Remember his title is the spoken word is the original seed. And he's saying if you go back to the original seed, it'll bring forth the right product. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says now the spoken word as it was at the beginning, the spoken word of God have his power for it is in him in his own body. &gt;&gt; So now he's going to what? Now what he's going to start talking about. Amen. This living word that's coming forth has to do with his body. Amen. So he's going to be talking about his body in the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Working his own way. Look to the promises that God gave his body. God gave promises to his body. Amen. What body is he talking about? He's talking about the body of believers, the bride. Amen. His body on earth, the church. Now, we're coming to something. We're coming to Mount Zion. So, it has to do with all of this. Back in the Peramian church age, he said he has to be for that is history repeating itself from the time of Ahab. Israel's history under Ahab is happening right here in America where the prophet of Malachi appears. As Israel left Egypt to worship in freedom, pushed out the natives or raised up a nation with great leaders like David, etc., then put an Ahab on the throne with a Jezebel behind him to direct him. So have we done the very same in America. Our forefathers left for this land to worship and live in freedom. They pushed back the natives and took over the land. Mighty men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up. But after a while, other men of such poor caliber succeeded these worthy men that soon Ahab was set in the presidential chair with a Jezebel behind him to direct him. It is at such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come. Then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel showdown. Watch this carefully now to see it in the word. John was the forerunner of Malachi 3. He planted the former rain and was rejected by the organizations of his day. Jesus came and had a mount transfiguration showdown. The second forerunner of Christ will sew for the latter reign. Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and creeds. So we want to look at this showdown. What is the showdown? It's between Jesus and the denominations and creeds. &gt;&gt; Amen. So brother Brandham's going to start telling us about this Jesus that's that that is the the the showdown between the denominations and creeds. He says, "For he will come. He will come to back up his word and to take his bride in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. This gets exciting for me. And as it builds, it just keeps building. So, he said the first showdown was Mount Carmel. The second was Mount Transfiguration and the third will be Mount Zion. So, Brother Benham is showing us in time there's been there's three great showdowns. Mount Carmel, Mount Transfiguration, and Mount Zion. And in order to understand Mount Zion, I want to look at these other two and see if there's a comparable uh uh uh thing that be be compared between all of them. But I want to show that it this is going to be between Jesus. I'm just going to Can I just give you uh jump to the chase cliff notes, &gt;&gt; give you the answer to the test? Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be between Jesus, the manifested &gt;&gt; word, &gt;&gt; for &gt;&gt; the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Brother's going to go clearly through this and begin to show us, amen, who Jesus is. Because Jesus was the word made flesh. He was the fullness of the word manifest for that hour. But at the end time, the showdown is going to once again be become between Jesus and the denomination and creeds. And in his day, it was between him and and the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the religious system of the day who had taken the word and done what they want with it. But he was the word now standing in flesh, the fullness of Godhead bodily. And now the showdown of Mount Transfiguration was it's all in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nowhere else. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now there's going to be a showdown again in the end time of Jesus and the denominations and creeds. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's keep walking. The last day messenger will appear in God's appointed time. It is the end time now as all know for Israel's in the homeland. Any time now he will come. Oh my goodness. We're reading this. Brother Brandham is standing there reading this. We read this any time now. For us it's not any time now. This has already happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're beyond this. Amen. Anytime now he will come. According to Malachi, when we see him, he will be he will be dedicated to the word. He was. He will be indicated pointed out in the word. Revelation 10:7. He was. And God will vindicate his ministry. He did. &gt;&gt; He will preach the truth as did Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion showdown. &gt;&gt; He was in future home. Brother Beam says makes this statement. He he's reading here out of Isaiah. Uh chapter 4:4 says, "It shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion, and he that is a remnant in Jerusalem, in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem." See, wherein the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughter of Zion. Remember that's always the bride. Brother Brandham is typing Zion with the bride. And shall have purified the blood of Jerusalem. That's the remnant of the Jews plus the bride. And in the midst thereof with the spirit of judgment, fire. So he's teaching us a principle here that in the Bible Zion and prophecy is a type of the bride and he's typing Jerusalem with the remnant of the Jews. Now let's go back to Joel 2 because this is quoted on the uh uh on the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts. Acts chapter 2 says, "And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmmaids. In those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord of the Lord come. And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered. That's as much as Peter re rehearsed. But if we keep going through the rest of the verse, it says, "For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord has said, and the remnant whom the Lord shall call." So there's going to be a re a deliverance for Mount Zion. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the choosing of the bride, brother says, I believe it was Elijah one time up on Mount Carmel after the showdown in a great hour of the crisis that we're just about to come to right now. Perhaps it may be to you or I tonight that we make this choice like the Mount Carmel experience. Frankly, I think it's going on worldwide now, but there will soon be a time where that you have to make a choice. So, Brother Benham is talking about this Mount Carmel showdown and he's typing it with a choice that has to be made. And he said, frankly, he thought it was going on worldwide then. And so, let's go and look at Mount Carmel. Let's turn together the first Kings 18 and start looking at this scripture together. First Kings chapter 18 verse 17. First Kings 18 and 17. And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elij saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him, "Art thou he that troubleth Israel?" And he answered,"I have not troubled Israel, but thou in thy father's house, and that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Balum. Now therefore, send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal 450, and the prophets of the gross 400 which eat at Jezebel's table." So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel. Amen. I thought this was interesting. There's going to be, Brother Bam talks about the Mount Carmel showdown. This is the Mount Carmel showdown that we're coming to. And when he comes to this time, God sends him now to address the nation. And and they're in a time of famine. They're in a dry time. And God sends him because it's time now for rain. So he sends him to the Mount Carmel showdown because it's time now for rain. So when he comes to the Mount Carmel showdown, he he says, "Gather together the prophets of Baal." And he says, "Are you the one that troubled Israel?" because they thought all the troubles came because this prophet was criticizing them so much and speaking contrary to everybody else. But he says, "No, you've troubled Israel because you left the commandments of the Lord." That's where the trouble came in in the church ages. That's where all the trouble was always coming by leaving the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Gather them together unto Carmel." So, I just clicked on Carmel to see what it meant because I mean there's everything has significance in the Bible. And Carmel means garden land. Gather to Mount Carmel. There's going to be a showdown in garden land. Amen. Why? Because everything has to do with what happened in the garden of God. And everything is a restoration back to the garden. Now, they're going to have a showdown on the top of Mount Carmel in garden land. I just I love it. Sometimes we don't even know what the full significance is, but you just tap into something. Let me say there's something there. Praise God. &gt;&gt; May he reveal more and more of it as we go. So let's let's look back at the Bible again here. Verse 21. And Elijah came unto all the people and said, "How long halt you between two opinions. If the Lord be God, follow him. But if Baal, then follow him." And the people answered him not a word. So when he comes to the Mount Carmel showdown, he's telling them, why are you halting between two opinions? You're not following wholly after the Lord, but you've you you've mixed this. Why? If Baal's God, follow him. If the Lord's God, follow him. But stop blending this religion because at the end time, it's all blended religion through denominations. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. In verse 22, he says, 'Then said Elijah unto the people, I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord, but Baal's prophets are 450 men. I'm going to read the scripture again. Then said Elijah and to the people, I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're looking at the Mount Carmel showdown. And the Mount Carmel showdown comes to Elijah versus everybody else. &gt;&gt; Right? I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord. But Baal's prophets are 450 men. Let them therefore give us two bullocks, and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under, and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under. And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord. And the God thatth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, "It is well spoken." So we know the prophets of Baal, they try, they they cry out, they lance themselves, they shout, and nothing happens. Then after all that, we come to verse 30. It says, "And Elijah said unto all the people, come near unto me." And all the people came near unto him, and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. Amen. He wasn't bringing a new religion. He was bringing them back to what they left. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he repaired the altar that was broke down. And Elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name. And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord. And he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed. And he put the wood in order and cut the bulllock in pieces and laid them on the wood and said, "Fill four full four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood." He said, "Do it a second time." And they did it the second time. And he said, "Do it the third time." And they did it the third time. And the water ran around about the altar and filled the trench also with water. And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said,"Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at thy word." What's he asking for? He's saying, "Vindicate that I'm speaking for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I did all this at the word and prove and vindicate that I am your prophet and I'm speaking for you. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou hast turned their heart back again. Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed and burnt sacrifi the the burnt the sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces, and they said, "The Lord, he is the God. The Lord, he is the God." And Elijah said unto them, "Take the prophets of Baal. Let not one of them escape." And they took them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Keon, and slew them there. And Elijah said unto Hab, "Get thee up, eat, and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain." So this is the Mount Carmel showdown. And we come to Mount Carmel showdown. There's an Elijah ministry. And Elijah has the word of the Lord. God has spoke to him and given him the word of the Lord. And that word is to restore back Israel to their proper worship. Amen. To repair their altar, to turn their hearts back again. &gt;&gt; And when he comes to the comes to the showdown, Amen. The showdown now becomes between one prophet and all the other prophets, &gt;&gt; all the other voices, all the other denominations, all the other whatever you want to call it. It's a showdown. where God now is going to vindicate that this is my voice and he's one. Amen. Only one voice and that voice has the correct word that is to turn the hearts of the children back to restore the altar to do what I commanded him to do and to bring the rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the Mount Carmel showdown between Elijah and the prophets of Baal. I just want you I just want to make note the reason I read that we've been through this before, but I want to emphasize the fact that the Mount Carmel showdown was between one voice and all the other voices &gt;&gt; and God vindicated which was his voice by a supernatural sign. Amen. And then they all they all their hearts were turned all of Israel their hearts were turned back to God. Amen. So let's continue on now. In Christ, the mystery of God revealed. He says, "The Holy Ghost alone shows you who he is, no prophets or his kings." And here, God is manifested in flesh. Here is the fullness. He's speaking of Jesus Christ. Now, I I'm going to go back. I don't have the quote uh uh on the overhead, but a couple paragraphs earlier in Christ is the mystery of God revealed, he says this. Now notice, not prophets, not kings, not nothing else, but here for the first time, God was revealed in Christ and the fullness of the Godhead bodily in human flesh. That's the revelation. Remember the title is Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And now he's saying now it's not in prophets. Now it's not in kings. Amen. Nothing else. But for the first time, God is revealed in Christ in the fullness of the Godhead bodily and flesh. This is the first time he's done that. It was partial in the prophets and in the kings. In David, it was a it was a reflection of Christ. It was a foreshadow of Christ. It was Christ in measure in Moses. It was Christ in measure in Jeremiah. But now, for the first time, it's God in the fullness, in flesh. That's the revelation. &gt;&gt; And then we come to this quote. Now he says, "The Holy Ghost alone shows you who he is. No prophets or kings. And here God is manifest in the flesh. Here is the fullness. He is completely revealed and made known to the world. Oh my. Look on Mount Transfiguration when the testimony of God himself. This is my beloved son. Hear ye him. There stood Moses representing the law. There stood Elijah representing the prophets. But they passed away and he said this is my beloved son. Hear him. There was three represented there. The law, the prophets and Christ. And he said, "This is him, God fully. Not manifested in prophets, not manifested by the law, but manifested in Christ." He is. Let's go look at this in Matthew 17 together. We saw the Mount Carmel showdown. Now we're coming to Mount Transfiguration Showdown. Matthew chapter 17. Matthew 17 verse one. And after six days Jesus taketh Peter and James and John his brother and bringeth him up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them. This is where we get the term mount transfiguration. That wasn't actually the name of the mountain. He took him to a mountain and was transfigured. So it became Mount Transfiguration. And he was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the sun, and his raignment was white as the light. And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias. And while he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice out of the cloud which said, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; Oh, this is gets so good, friends. I I just pray that God will help me just to get out of myself and jump out of my skin and let God take over because there's something so rich and so good here that I want to bring. Amen. Amen. They they they they have these two witnesses that appear with Jesus as he's transfigured and he's shown in his all of his glory and he's glorifi he's in a glorified condition and his face did shine and his reignment was white as snow and and appearing with them and unto them. Amen. Where Moses and Elijah and it looked to Peter like this is great. You're one of the three. Now look at these three witnesses. Let's build three tabernacles. that God did not bring Moses and Elijah for that purpose because Moses represents the law. Elijah represents the prophet and the law and the prophets were the entire word to that point. &gt;&gt; They were the entire Old Testament. The New Testament wasn't written yet. Jesus came as a as as the as the key, amen, between the two. And now the whole word is here testifying by the mouth of two witnesses that this is the fulfillment of everything Moses wrote and all that the prophets had declared. Here he is. and that God brought two witnesses to witness to this transfiguration. And and and Peter misunderstood the role of the witnesses. But God thundered out with a voice. He said, "This is my son. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No other voice, no other prophets, brother. No other kings. But now everything, the fullness of the word was wrapped up in him. And he was saying now it's in him. hear him. &gt;&gt; That's what he did to Elijah in Mount Carmel with the vindication in Carmel. He said, "He has the voice. He did this at my word. Hear him." &gt;&gt; And now in Mount Transfiguration, he brings Jesus into a glorified condition. Amen. And he shows that the law and the prophets are in him. They're testifying it's in him. Now I'm in him. Now everything's in him. This is the fullness made flesh. Hear him. &gt;&gt; It was the showdown between Jesus Christ and every other voice. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said in blasphe blasphemous names. While he was yet speaking, God shut him up. He said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear him." See, God put himself in the background. &gt;&gt; This is amazing. And said, "This is my son. This is now who I am. This is now where I am. This is now where I'm dwelling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, this is Mount Transfiguration Showdown. In the showdown, there wasn't a thousand prophets of Baal. There wasn't all the Pharisees and Sadducees. Amen. There was the law and the prophets witnessing that, hey, we're turning it all over to him. Amen. It's all him. Everything we talked about in him. Everything we pointed to is in him. Everything we demonstrated, it's in him. Now it's all in him. It's him. He's all of it. And everything else subsides because it's him. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; And then in desperations he says God did the same thing by his son on Mount Transfiguration. He was overshadowed by a cloud and was transfigured and his raignment shine like the sun and a voice said this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Moses and the law had failed. And this is him. Hear ye him. He was placed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was adoption. &gt;&gt; Now he'd come to Now he'd been proven. Now he'd been tested to be proved a perfect son. Now he is being placed as what? He He is all of it. It's all in him. Everything's in him. Hear him. &gt;&gt; Mount Transfiguration Showdown. &gt;&gt; Amen. him against who? Him against any other voice. &gt;&gt; It's only in him. I'm in him. The word is in him. All my thought is in him. The fullness of the word is in him. It's all in him. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, let's go to the rest of the scripture. Pick it up. Matthew 17:6. And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were sore afraid. And Jesus came and touched him and said, "Arise and be not afraid." And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man. No man saved Jesus only. &gt;&gt; Amen. This was the Mount Transfiguration Showdown. This is nobody else. No other voice. Nothing else. It's all I put my voice in him. I put my word in him. I put myself in him. It's all in him. Hear him. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Mount Carmel. No other prophet, nobody else had the word for restoration. It was all in Elijah. It was in him. He said, "I alone remain a prophet of the Lord. I by myself." And God vindicated that he was the voice. It was him. Not the 450, not the other 400. Amen. It was him. &gt;&gt; And God come in mount transfiguration. He said, "No other voice. Nobody else speaks. No, it's all in him." &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says it was something as I said this morning like the people or like Peter said in St. Matthew 17:4 to8 where he said it's good to be here. Let's build three tabernacles. But the spirit bade them not to do it. He said this is my beloved son. Hear ye him and he is the word. That's who we're to look to the word not our enthusiasm or something else. He is my word. Hear ye him. And what did they see after this voice spoke to them? Even Moses and Elijah wasn't present. Neither was there a creed. What? Neither was there a creed. &gt;&gt; Neither was there anything left but Jesus only and he is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all they seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to go back to pick up your pen and write. And he says the showdown be will be between Jesus and the denominations and creed. And what is Jesus? He is the word. Who is our bridegroom? The word made manifest for the day. Amen. Jesus is the word. Whenever the anointed word comes on the scene, that's Christ. That's Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's all they seen. What was all they seen? The word. &gt;&gt; He was the word. &gt;&gt; He was the fullness of the word bodily. He was glorified, showing who he really was. &gt;&gt; In the Easter Seal, he says, "No wonder Jesus said, "Fear not. I'm he that was dead, but I'm alive forever more. For now we are redeemed by him and are risen with him and are now not will be sitting in heavenly places in him. Now when when we have this spirit in us, the abstract shows that all of the doubts has been stricken off. Why? Christ lives, not I live. Oh, I want you to focus on this right here. Not I live, not me, but Christ lives in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not you live but Christ lives in you because his living word lives in you showing that all the accounts of all your Methodism, baptism, Pentecost ideas, everything else was stricken off uh everything on else was stricken off. And Jesus Christ like on Mount Transfiguration, all the prophets and everything else is finished. All the days of Luther and Methodist and Presbyterian, they're all right. But this is my beloved son. Hear ye him. Who is he? The word of this hour, the hour of the seals. Hear ye him, the fullness of the word, brought back to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When all the mysteries back yonder that's been hid all these years, them is that great pyramid of time was stricken off the headstone. Make it honed down so that the star of David was settled into its place and the great church of the living God will be raised like the wings of an eagle packed out yonder to glory. Yes, this is my beloved son. Hear ye him. the word of this hour, the hour of the seals &gt;&gt; in the restoration of the bride tree. He says, "But what?" He was God's perfect prophet tree, the example tree, the bridegroom tree. Amen. Glory. Going to say something directly. He is the bridegroom tree. Do you believe it? From the Garden of Eden. Then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit. He's got to have a bride tree. She has got to be born of the same materials, the word made flesh in the tree. &gt;&gt; Hope you get it. It's the same life in this female tree, the bridegroom, as it is in the bride. The works that I do shall you do also. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, he's saying, Brother Bam's coming and telling us, Amen, that the bridegroom tree, Amen, he can't bear fruit without a bride tree. He needs a bride tree. Why? He's pointing all the way back to the masterpiece in the Garden of Eden when Adam was alone. God said, "It's not good that man shall dwell alone. I shall make a help meat for him." And out of Adam, he brought the perfect help meat, which was his wife, which was a part of Adam, Adam's spirit, Adam's flesh, made into a manifestation. And God united them back to two. And brother Brenham said that was his great work, the two becoming one, &gt;&gt; the masterpiece family. And he's pointing back to that when he speaks to this. Now, he's the bridegroom tree from the Garden of Eden, the tree of life. But that tree without the female tree because that picture has to be perfect. That's a perfect picture. And what God's working with is what he foreshadowed in the Garden of Eden. And now he needs a bride tree. But what will the bride tree be? She'll be the word made flesh in this tree. &gt;&gt; Cuz he was the word made flesh in him. Now it's got to be the word made flesh in his bride. &gt;&gt; The same life in this female tree. Now you see why? Listen. I don't know how to say these things. You see how that can't be you. That can't be you. The one born of your mom and dad. That can't be you. The one who grew up a boy. That can't be you. That has to be Christ in you. &gt;&gt; It's got to be something more than than you. This flesh you that you see in the mirror. That you is hybrid. That you is wrong. But there's another you on the inside. That's an attribute of almighty God. A sea gene of God. Amen. That's part of this life. And that has to come to life by his life, by his word to bring forth his life again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not Listen, we can we can say we can say I'm bride. I'm bride. I'm bride all I want. Amen. But saying it doesn't make it so. Amen. But those who his life comes to live in those who his word abides in those who become the very manifestation of the hour. Amen. in the manifestation of Jesus Christ's life in a many membered body. That is the bride. That is the restoration of the bride tree. &gt;&gt; That is where his life is. That is where his word is made flesh. Man, we believe by faith that we're part of that. But whether we're part of that or not, it doesn't stop. It's still going to be on earth and it's still going to be in flesh and it's still going to be his life in a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And God's provided place of worship. He said there's only one meeting place &gt;&gt; that's in Christ Jesus. Oh, today how how today that I would that everybody would see that see how to get in being baptized. The bride is part of her husband. The church is part of the word the manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Back in Ephesians 5, he says, "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they too shall be one flesh. &gt;&gt; This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ in the church. The great mystery is that Christ and his church will be one flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the great mystery. &gt;&gt; Things that are to be says now if we are those attributes of God, we cannot live by creits. We cannot live by denominationalism. We must live by the word. That's why the word has been restored in this day because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband. Therefore, we must be that word bride. And what is the word bride? The manifestation of this hour, the bride, not the creed or the denominations, but a living oracle of God, a living attribute of God, displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride. That's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the word bride? Listen, this is why to be bride, you have to be a word bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can't be a You can't You and I cannot be bride by our declaration through our mouth alone. Because this must be a word bride. What is a word bride? The word bride is a one who submitted to surrendered to the headship of the word totally given over so that he can take preeminence and then that word can live out in the flesh that he's abiding in. That's what it takes to be a word bride. Not coming to a certain church, not agreeing with a certain standard. Amen. Not saying I'm a so and so. But what makes a word bride is a body, a people who surrendered to the word for their hour, who's come in contact with a living Jesus Christ in their hour and died to everything else but this message and this headship and now letting the headship come to the body and work through the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what it takes to be a word bride. And I want to be a word bride. And in order to be a word bride, I've got to lay down my life every day. I got to die more than I died the day before. And if I've got one thought contrary to this message, I got to die to that thought. And if I got anything in my life that's contrary, I need the spirit of God to come and burn that thing out of me. Because to be a word bride, I've got to be manifesting the word. &gt;&gt; You can't get it by attendance. &gt;&gt; It's not where you go to church. It's not even what you agree with. Amen. It's not just that alone. Amen. It's an absolute surrender to the message of this hour. And this message is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a restoration of the truth that have been lost down through time. God, what? And then brought to the the the mystery of what was in the back part of God's mind. Amen. And that has been whispered as love secrets &gt;&gt; into the ear of his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she surrenders herself to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he must be the word bride. And what is the word bride? The manifestation of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not a creed or denomination. Remember what the showdown is in Mount Zion. &gt;&gt; It's a showdown between Jesus and the denominations and creeds. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Christ is the mystery. He says, "Now he's sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed." Now, see, he could go back and pick up what these other fellas has left off here in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mysteries of the seven seals. See, he he is expressing himself. I I want to circle this because I like circling stuff, but I want to highlight this because so many times we read stuff and we've read it before and we know it. But but listen, by his Holy Spirit, he revealed all the mystery of the seven seals &gt;&gt; so that you would know what a red horse is and a white. No, he's trying to reveal himself. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he's trying by the opening of the seals, the revealing of the of the seven thunders, he's trying to reveal himself. He's trying to show you who's present, where we are in time, what he's trying to accomplish in this hour. He's attempting through the opening of the word to reveal himself. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's his purpose. That's why he died. That's the second fold of his three-fold manifestation. First, to express himself in Christ. He did that in Jesus Christ. Then express himself through the church. And the same thing, Christ was the word. And the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them. &gt;&gt; I don't become the word by saying I'm becoming the word. I become the word by surrendering to the word and letting the life of the word, which is the spirit of God, the spirit of Christ, come and flow through me. So now it's not a life I live myself, but it's a life he comes and lives through me. It's a surrender as a wife. It's it's a connection to the headship and to the power of this word that's been released. &gt;&gt; Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them. Amen. I want to turn, can you turn with me to John 14, the Gospel of John? John 14 and verse 23. Actually, uh, let's go to verse 18. No, no, I'm sorry. 16. Is it okay if we back up and read plenty? &gt;&gt; We got a little bit of time. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. And I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. Even the spirit of truth. We know this by the rest of the scripture. This is the Holy Spirit. This is the Holy Ghost. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not. Neither knoweth him. But you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you &gt;&gt; yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day brother said that's this day &gt;&gt; at that day you shall know that I am in my father ye in me and I in you in my father and ye in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; So where'd the father go? &gt;&gt; Verse 21. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, what is his commandments? That's his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of the word. Don't think of rules and regulations and all. Just think of the word. He that hath my commandments, my word, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me shall be loved to my father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him. &gt;&gt; Verse 22. Judas saith unto him, not a scariat, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world? Now, manifest means reveal. I'll come and unveil or reveal myself to them. He said, how will you come and show yourself to us and not to the whole world? If you come, won't they see you? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you come back to us, won't they see you? So, how will you come back to us and reveal yourself to us, but not reveal yourself to the whole world? Because he says, "I won't leave you comfortless. I will come to you." He's speaking the same person. It's not another person. It's the same person. But how is the same person going to come and reveal himself to disciples and not the rest of the world see them because all they understand is what they're seeing before their eyes, the word made flesh in Jesus Christ. And they said, "If you come, yeah, not just us will see you. Everyone will see you." But they don't understand what this coming is going to be like. It's the same person in another form. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, how is the will thyself unto us? How wilt thou manifest thyself unto us and not into the world?" Jesus answered and said unto him, "If a man love me, he will keep my words." It comes back to the word, friends. It always comes back to the word. If a man love me, he will keep my words. And my father will love him. And we say we &gt;&gt; and we will come unto him and make our abode with him. &gt;&gt; We how are you going to come? The question is how are you going to manifest yourself unto us and not to the world? &gt;&gt; Here's his answer. If any man keep my words. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see why there had to be a restoration of the word at the end time so we could come back to that in that day you will know I am in the father ye and me and I brother Bam said in that day is this day because in order to keep the word there had to be a restoration of the word in the hour of the restoration of the word how Lord Jesus will you come and reveal yourself to us and the whole world won't see you when you come back to your church I'll tell you how because if you keep my word &gt;&gt; if you love me you will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him. We two, there's not two, there's only one, but these are two offices. The office of the father and the office of the son. And how will they come? Through the office of the holy ghost. So all three are coming into the church. &gt;&gt; That's how he manifest himself into them and not to the world. If a man loves me, &gt;&gt; he'll keep my words and my father will love him. &gt;&gt; And we don't believe in trinitarianism. We don't believe in two persons or three persons in the Godhead. What he saying? All that God was, he poured into Christ. All that Christ was, he poured into the church. And so now, what's coming into the church? Amen. If you keep my word, if you love me and keep my word, in the hour that you have my word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you'll have the father and you have the son by the office of the holy ghost, you get fullness again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be unto our god. Friends, let's move on. Now Christ is the mystery regard. He says that's it. Christ the word. He was the word. He is the word and the church becomes the word by him making her a part of him. And that's the word again. What is it? The marriage, the invisible union. Amen. The headship coming to the body, the word coming down to have an abiding place, abiding in the hearts of his people. And when that invisible union takes place, he said the church becomes the word by him making her a part of him. And that's the word again, personally identified by him. His property alone, his property alone. She is redeemed by him, through him, for him, and for him alone. That's right. Then what is the devil howling about that? It's being revealed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In Ephesians 1, he says, "And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him the head to be the gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that fleth all in all." &gt;&gt; He gave him to be head over all things to the church, which is his body. &gt;&gt; What is his body? What is Oh my goodness, I did it again. What is his body? The church. &gt;&gt; And what is his body? The fullness of him that filth all in all. &gt;&gt; What does God want to become in the end time? He wants to come into his church. He himself and her until she will be him. &gt;&gt; The two will be one flesh. This is the great mystery that I speak of concerning Christ in the church that the two will be one flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fullness of him that fillth all in all. That's the expression that he's looking for. Now in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. says, "Identified all the devil is howling about this, the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the devil howling about? &gt;&gt; What is he so angry about? What's causing all the fuss? What's causing all the disagreement? What's all the fuss about? The manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. They don't have the answer. When Jesus come, why didn't those Pharisees, he said, if I cast out the devil by the finger of God, who do you cast him out by? He stood alone and his church stands alone. &gt;&gt; Are we seeing this? &gt;&gt; She is not hooked with nothing, but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in. And the church is identified by his body doing the same thing. What's the same thing? Being the body that he dwells in. &gt;&gt; Amen. She is his body. The manifested truth of his promised word for the last days. She is his body, which is what? The manifested truth of the promised word for the last days. And she and she alone stands by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody else believes this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She's the only one who stands with the true revelation of the true word. And it's in her only. It's nowhere else. You don't find this revelation anywhere else. This manifestation. Because if you love me, you keep my words and you keep my words. What words? All of my word. &gt;&gt; Then my father will love you and we will come into you and make our abode with you in that day. That's this day, friends. &gt;&gt; And she alone stands by it. That's why the devil is howling. And these great organizations set up try to set up something to close her up. They'll never do it. She'll be taken up, not closed up. She is now. Oh my goodness. She is now risen. And by the power of the vindicated word promised to her, she is risen. Risen from what? Risen from dead denominationalism. Risen from the darkness of obscurity of the word. But she's risen back to what? She's been awakened by the latter rain. Amen. There's been nothing to stir the bride yet. Amen. But now they're crying for revivals. Revival. Revival. Why? Because they they know something's got to happen, but they haven't recognized the awakening of the bride. She is risen by the power of the vindicated word promised to her. Amen. &gt;&gt; She's now been raised up like Ezekiel's dry bones. She's now come back to what she was supposed to be. And now he's pouring his full word into her. &gt;&gt; And the devil's howling &gt;&gt; about this manifestation of the truth of the promised word in her alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the Mount Zion showdown? What was the Mount Carmel showdown? &gt;&gt; Yeah. one prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The voice of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The vindicated voice of God against every other voice. &gt;&gt; What was Mount Transfiguration? Hear ye him. One man, the fullness of the word, and every other voice silenced. &gt;&gt; What is the Mount Zion showdown? Him and her, the word and her alone. And she's the only one that stands by it. And every other voice is silent, no denomination, no creed, no other teaching. This is the truth of Jesus Christ. This is the revelation of Jesus Christ. This is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; That's what they're howling about the revelation &gt;&gt; in her &gt;&gt; alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the legacy in church age out of the church age book. He says the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God is it it is its own mouthpiece. So God is turning on her. He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be where in hermen. &gt;&gt; Where where else? &gt;&gt; Nowhere else. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Mount Zion showdown will be between Jesus the word and the denominations and creeds. Where will Jesus the word be? He will be in bride form. &gt;&gt; It's not you and I, friends. We don't have the mental ability. We don't have the power and the strength. It's what it's not what we are. It's what we surrender to. It's what what we are by predestination. Not what we are by natural birth. what we are by predestinated by by predestinated order of God brought to life by the new birth. This is why we had to come to the new birth. Amen. Because the old birth we were born wrong. &gt;&gt; So we had to be born by the spirit so that we can move into this position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says yes it is. So the voice of God will be in her. Yes it is. For it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Once more, the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost. But of course, the word bride will be repudiated as in the first age. What does that mean? No one else will believe it. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't change the truth of it. Again, in the Leodysian church age, oh, God still has a voice for the people of the world. He does. Who was the voice in Mount Carmel showdown? Elijah. Who is the voice at man's transfiguration showdown? Hear ye him, Jesus Christ, the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But where is the voice in the end time? He has given a voice to the bride. And that voice is in the bride. &gt;&gt; And we will talk more about that later. I want to read this scripture. Revelation 10 verse 10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." &gt;&gt; Who is this referring to? This was John. John was a type of the bride. What's the bride got to do? She's got to take this open book and eat it. And then she's got to prophesy again. &gt;&gt; There's a voice again. The voice of God again is in a people. What people? Amen. He's It's in his bride. &gt;&gt; What bride? The word bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be part of that word bride. &gt;&gt; I want to be surrendered to every word. I I want to I want to love him and keep his words. &gt;&gt; And I want I want him and the father and the holy ghost and all of God to pour into me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I want to read one quote to you. I don't have it on here, but you know it really, really well. But I'm just going to go to it quickly. Says this is in Revelation chapter 4 when he preached it there in 1962. He says or 1961, I'm sorry. said, "All right." Here was voices. Oh, how we need in Jeffersonville. Thousands of lived voices. The thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness, purity, undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish. Yes, sir. Real Christians, that's thunder against the enemy. The devil don't care how loud you can holler. The devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout. But what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God. Say anything to him, call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on. Oh my, that throws him away. That's the thunder that shakes the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a voice of God in the last days. And yes, the bride is proclaiming the true word of God. But she's doing more than speaking it. Amen. It's becoming life. It's becoming a manifestation because this word has to be a living word. It has to be the life of Christ on display. It's got to live in a many membered body. So, it's got to live in you and it's got to live in me. And I've got to let it go through me so that it can live through me. &gt;&gt; You may not be the one who stands up. You may not be the one who declares it over a PA system somewhere, but every time you walk down the road in obedience to the headship of the word, you're speaking. Amen. It's a voice of God that thunders against the devil because this revelation is in her alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's living the word. She's manifesting the word. She knows the word and she knows what he wants done with it. And there's &gt;&gt; there's no other voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've come to the hour where the voice is in the bride. those who surrender to the word, those who have predestinated that position and who've come to a full surrender. That's where his voice is. &gt;&gt; And I want his voice to ring clear through me. &gt;&gt; If there's going to be one voice and Elijah was one voice and Jesus was one voice and this bride will be one voice, I want that voice to give a clear tone. I want it to ring out the life of Christ only. The word and the word only. I don't want it to ring out the word mixed with some other things. I don't want it to be mixed with my temper, mixed with my pride and mixed with my prejudice. I want it to be the word and the word only because it's coming down to where that's the only place that the word abides and that's the only place the voice remains. &gt;&gt; That's the mount to me friends that's the Mount Zion showdown. &gt;&gt; It's between Jesus Christ and the denominations and creeds. Everyone claims to be a church and claims to be a bride and claims to be a woman. But there's one that's been united through an invisible union &gt;&gt; with Jesus Christ and his life in her. And she has the voice. She has the word. And I want that word to live in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together. We're going to stop there for today and not go any further. Oh friends, we can we can say a lot of things and we can speak a lot of things and we can claim a lot of things, but I don't want to be in the business of claiming. I don't want to be in the business of speaking. I want to be in the business of manifesting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talk is cheap. Amen. Anybody can say anything and anybody can repeat like a parrot and anybody can read stuff or hear stuff preach and go off and say all kinds of stuff. I don't want to be in that business. I don't want to be a self-proclaiming bride member. that the only time somebody knows that I'm part of the bride is when I say I'm part of the bride. But I want them to know by the life that I live. I want it to be demonstrated by the word of God that I've surrendered to living through me that I'm subject to the headship and only the headship of Christ. And that word is the only thing that's going to have preeminence in my life. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. I want the life to go. Somebody may not be able to put the right terms to it or understand how to say it, but I want the life of Christ to live through me. There is somebody says there's something different about that person right there. What they got is real. They might not even be able to say that's the voice of God. That's Jesus Christ and that person. But they'll say that's godly. That's Christ. That's real. That's true. That's right. That's the word. &gt;&gt; That's the life I want to live, friends. And I say, "God, help me. I need your help every day, every hour of every day." But oh friends, we've been given a message. The seals have been loosed. Christ has been unlocked. Amen. He's come back, amen, to abide in a people. He He wants to rest in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want him to rest in me. &gt;&gt; And I want the showdown to go right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not my brain, not my strength, not my not my works, but I want it to be the showdown between Jesus Christ and the denomination. But you can use this figure right here for the showdown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your life on display in me. your word manifest in me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't want the showdown to be Chad Lamb versus the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Listen, forget it, friends. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be on my understanding versus your understanding. That's not the showdown we're looking for. We're not looking for debate. We're not looking for doctrinal Amen. doctrinal clarity in a debate field. We're not looking for that kind of showdown. The showdown is there's one place that Christ is abiding and his word has come back to unite with the people and he's in his body and the headship's in the body and it's manifesting his life through her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's got to be for real. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want. &gt;&gt; That's what I want with all my heart. That's what I believe I'm predestinated to. I can say like we've heard said so many times, I'm not what I want to be. &gt;&gt; I'm not even what I ought to be. But I thank God I'm not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; As God continually reminds us of the word and keeps rubbing the eyes out in our eyes and we see his plan more clearly all the time. It becomes the only thing that matters in our lives. &gt;&gt; The only thing that be I mean there's still life to live. There's still family. There's still children. There's still things that we have to accomplish. That's part of what God wants to do. He wants to live in you and I wherever we work, wherever we abide because part of our duty is to manifest Christ to this neighborhood in this place where we work and where we live. &gt;&gt; But listen friends, I don't want to be distracted by where he wants me to live and what he wants me to do. I want to keep my eyes fixed on the purpose. And his purpose is to express himself &gt;&gt; to have preeminence in a people. And I want him to have preeminence in this person right here. I can't force it on anybody else. I can't make him have preeminence there and there, and I can't make anybody else surrender. I've got a full-time job keeping this flesh of mine under wraps. &gt;&gt; But oh, God, &gt;&gt; I don't want to walk around with with with a bride label and somebody say, "Oh, you're part." No, I want the the bride label to be my life, my words that are seasoned by Christ, my actions that manifest his word. &gt;&gt; Let that be my declaration. Let be my label. Let that be the thunder that shakes the devil. Let that be the showdown between Jesus Christ and the denominations. &gt;&gt; God, manifest yourself in us. &gt;&gt; Help us to not just talk about this message. Help us to be the message &gt;&gt; to live the life to manifest the life to to obey every word out of a loving heart out of love for Christ to surrender ourselves more and more to love to to do all that he did. Let let it be done in us. You feel the same way. &gt;&gt; You want it to be in you. I I look in the mirror the same way you look in the mirror and I see faults the same way you see faults and I know my mistakes the same way you know your mistakes and we look and we say like like if that's the if that's the showdown if that's where it at listen I'm falling short but you I and everybody else is falling short but this prophecy will never fall short &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; stop looking at hybridization and look at the promise stop looking at how far away you are and start looking how close you are closer than you've ever been &gt;&gt; with a greater revelation than you've ever had with a desire in your heart that's bubbling over to serve him and him alone more than it ever has before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're closer than we've ever been. Friends, keep pressing. Amen. Keep surrendering. Keep loving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep opening our heart to him. &gt;&gt; And let him let let it be the showdown between Jesus Christ and the denominations. &gt;&gt; But where will the showdown take place? On Mount Zion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Through the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Musicians, if you'd please come. Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you for this word. God, sometimes I know that we can't fully grasp with a mind, with a mental capacity what it is you're actually trying to do through each one of us. And God, I just pray Lord that you would drop it into our souls. That you would water it with your spirit. That you would bring it to a greater manifestation. Help that seed word grow in the good ground that you've prepared before the foundation of the world. God, prune off anything that's unlike you, Lord. Cut it away from us. Give us the strength by the indwelling of your spirit to live this word. for God. It's all come back to your word. Your word has to be manifest in flesh in the end time. And you've predestinated a body, your bride body. You've predestinated the members. You've chosen them in you before the foundation of the world. And you know who they are and where they'll stand. And you know that she's predestinated to this glorious stand. So God, by faith, we believe ourselves included in this. But oh, how we need you more than we ever needed you before. God, as we surrender ourselves aresh to you. Would you take us, Lord, and would you just burn out the dross once again? Would you clean out this house, Lord, and fill us aresh with the anointing of your spirit? May this word have room to live and flow through us because we heard your prophet say, we become the word by letting the word flow through us. God, that means we have to have a surrender. There has to be an act of our will. There has to be a desire to see you have preeminence. God, look into our hearts. Fill us aresh, Lord. Use us. Anoint us for this work. And God, God, in this in the showdown, God, may there be those who hear your voice, when they see the life manifest and hear the truth of the word, may your seed come to you, Lord. God, may our lives make a difference in this end time, man. In the showdown, just like it was on Mount Carmel, there was those who came back to you, Lord. And God, as you show yourself in this showdown, in the Mount Zion showdown, may you draw all your elect seed to yourself, Lord. Oh, we love you. We trust in you, Lord, to accomplish what you promised to accomplish in this day. May you do it in each one of us, Lord. We love you. We ask for your blessings over all that's said and done. And may it not be a sermon, but may it become a reality. May it not be words, but may it translate into manifestation because the spoken word must come into manifestation. And God, when you spoke your word, in the beginning, you said, "Let there be light." But there come a time the light had to shine. And God, you spoke through your prophet and you're speaking through your five-fold ministry that this light has to shine in bride form. But God, it's got to be more than just the word. There has to come a time then that word comes into a manifestation and the light has to shine in her. God, let that be happening now under the sounding of my voice. Let the power of this word that's been released in this hour bring the manifestation to pass. God, it's got to be you. It's got to be all you and only you as we surrender. We love you, God. We surrender to you. Do your work in us. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. Brother John. We're living in the evening time. The race is almost through. But God has chosen you and me. There's still a job to do. The word that's been revealed to us must be prophesied again. And the message must reach everywhere till the last soul has come in. We are the generation. We are the culmination. Final voice that the world will hear. Coming of the Lord is here. Living out the revelation. Overcoming sins temptation. Truth will go to every side and nation. We are the chosen generation, [Music] committed to the calling. Together we stand strong. Lifting up our voices one, we sing the final song. Oh, God has chosen us to conquer in every test we face. And he has seen us through this far and will finish by his grace. We are the generation. We are the culmination. The final voice that the world will hear. The coming of the Lord is near. Living out with revelation. [Music] Overcoming sins temptation. Truth will go to every tongue and nation. [Music] We are the chosen generation. Amen. I was thinking about what we've been predestinated to. Friends, not because we willed it, not because we ourselves determined it, but because God before the foundation of the world determined it. &gt;&gt; And he will have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he's done all that he's done so far. That's why he vindicated his prophet. That's why he vindicated his word. That's why he's brought it to us the way he has. &gt;&gt; But I thought of brother Brandham and when I think of myself trying to imagine myself being part of this Mount Zion showdown, I I I can't imagine me in my flesh. I have to go deeper than that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I think of brother Brandham being the prophet of the age, the the seventh angel, Revelation 10:7, the place where Malachi uh 4 is going to be revealed in that vessel. When I think of him doing all of that, listen, there was no way he could do it. His pro his pastor told him, "How are you going to pray for kings and pop days to travel around the world? You with a seventh grade education." And he said, "I don't know how, but he said it." Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam didn't know how he was going to do any of these things. And as things started unfolding in his life, and his own position in the scriptures became more clear to him, he had no more ability to accomplish anything than you and I do. All that he had was a predestinated seed inside and a gift and a and the Holy Ghost anointing to bring it to pass. Amen. But what he did was he kept walking in the word as God revealed it to him. And that word brought itself to pass in his life. &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself and don't look at what you can and can't do. Listen, none of us can do what we've been predestinated to do. Amen. But the word in us can make a way for itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do we need to do? Receive the word. Believe the word. Confess the word. Walk in the word. And the word has its own life. And the word will make a way. Amen. to manifest itself. Don't look at yourself. Look at the word. Don't look at what you can or can't. Look at him. He's the promised word of the hour. He is the bridegroom. He is the one come back to take you by the hand and lead you all the way home. Keep looking at him. &gt;&gt; He can do it. &gt;&gt; How will I this? I don't know how you will. How will I I don't know how I will. All I know is he said it and I'm going to put my hand in his and I'm going to keep walking just like that prophet did. And any obstacle that gets in the way of this word, he's going to have to somehow remove it. Give me power to overcome it. Speak through my lips to remove it. I don't know what he's going to do, but he's got to make a way for himself. Cuz this isn't me. This is him &gt;&gt; in me. Oh, we've got to come to a place where our confidence in the word goes higher than our confidence in our flesh. and where we just walk by the word and let the word bring itself to pass and bring the manifestation. He'll do it, friends. He promised he would. He's not going to fail. Amen. God bless you all. Amen. Thank you for being patient with me. It's good to be back home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love to be here. I love to see your faces. And I love I love the atmosphere where God is opening his word and somebody's hungry to receive it. I'm hungry for it. &gt;&gt; I don't want to ever lose my appetite. This is a God-given appetite. Don't take it for granted. Not everybody wants to eat this food, &gt;&gt; but we want it. And I want more of it. And that's a God-given appetite. And I thank God for it. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for you. And I thank thank God for a place to come preach the word. Amen. And the fullness of the revelation that he's given to me and a people who want it all. All that they can get. &gt;&gt; And say, "God, help us with more." Amen. God bless you all as you're dismissed. Brother John, if we could sing. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus I really want to see. [Music] Oh, it is Jesus [Music] I really want to see. And the more I see of this old world, the less it means to me. Oh, it's Jesus I really want to see. [Music] Oh yes, it's Jesus that I really want to see. Oh yes, it's Jesus I really want to see. [Music] And the more I see of this world, the less it means to me. Oh, it's Jesus. I really want to see. And he who began a good work in you, [Music] oh he began a good work in you. He'll be faithful to complete it. He'll be faithful to complete it. He who started the work will be faithful to complete it in you. And he who began a good work in me. Oh, he began a good work in me. He'll be faithful to complete it. He'll be faithful to complete it. He who started the work will be faithful to complete it in me. Oh, and he who began a good work in me. [Music] Oh, he who began a good work in me. He'll be faithful to complete it. He'll be faithful to complete it. He who started the work will be faithful to complete it in me. And I was born to be a dwelling place, a home for the presence of the Lord. Let my life now be separated unto thee that I might be what I was born to be. For I was born to be a dwelling [Music] place, a home for the presence of the Lord. Let my life now be separated unto thee that I might be what I was born to be. and I will serve thee because I love thee. For you have given life to me and I was not before you found me. For you have given life to me. Oh, there was heartache and broken pieces. This ruined life. It's why you died on Calary. But your touch is what I long for. Oh, you have given given life to me. Oh, I will serve thee. I will serve thee because I love thee. For you have given life to me and I was nothing [Music] before you found me. But you have given life to me. Oh, it was heartache and broken pieces [Music] through life. Oh, one died on Calary. Your God is what I long for. Oh, you have given life to me.
