TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now what if god would send his message by an angel to mary and said hail mary blessed art thou amongst women you're going to have a baby knowing no man she said now wait a minute here let me take you down to the laboratory and you tell me let the doctor prove to me just how i'm going to do this then i'll believe you it would never happen but what did she what what did she come to the womb of her heart the womb of her spirit the womb of her spirit is your mind your mind is a channel so i want you to catch that your mind is a channel and that's what god was using as gabriel was speaking unto mary he was using the channel of her mind amen to unlock the faith that was laying down in her because she was predestinated to bring forth that virgin seed amen the seed of the woman from before the foundation of the world remember that that faith had to be unlocked amen and we know that it had to do with mary's faith because when she went to go visit elizabeth amen she gave a salutation her salutation caused that baby the leap in the womb of elizabeth and elizabeth began to prophesy and as elizabeth began to prophesy amen he says she begins to say something on the order of because these things shall be performed in you because you believed because you believe these things will be performed because you believed amen because everything in the kingdom of god operates by faith amen so the these things that the angel told you they're not happening because the angel told you they're happening because you believe what the angel told you amen because it requires faith but faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god amen so god is using our senses to bring in us amen the quickening power amen to bring the word and then when the words receive the spirit comes on top of the word which is quickening power to make the word live and because you believe it'll be done according to your faith praise god so mary had to receive and believe the angel's message
