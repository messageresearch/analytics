[14:54] like you
[15:00] the worthless
[15:04] fast we
[15:09] [Applause]
[15:11] go amen let's bow our heads together
[15:14] oh Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[15:17] your graciousness and goodness to us
[15:19] Lord
[15:20] your mercy that is new Every Morning
[15:22] Lord abounds towards your children and
[15:25] we're so thankful for that
[15:26] and Lord we've come to this service to
[15:28] glorify and honor your name to Lift Your
[15:31] Name on High to sing your praises to
[15:34] magnify your name and now while we come
[15:37] to the portion of the service where we
[15:39] read from your word
[15:40] that you've ordained the preaching of
[15:42] the gospel and Lord we're giving our
[15:45] attention to that now we pray God that
[15:46] you would come and work through this
[15:48] method that you promised to work through
[15:50] or that you would take control of these
[15:52] lips and that you would speak your words
[15:54] of eternal life
[15:55] may you plant your seed in our heart
[15:57] Lord and may it bring forth a Bountiful
[15:59] Harvest pray you have your way and may
[16:02] your Holy Spirit move in our lives and
[16:05] may you bring the past within us what
[16:07] you've ordained for this hour we love
[16:09] you we ask that you would help us Lord
[16:11] as we look into your word may you break
[16:13] the bread of life to us in Jesus
[16:16] Christ's name we pray
[16:19] and while we're standing if we take our
[16:21] Bibles and turn to Romans chapter 5
[16:23] we'll read one portion of scripture and
[16:25] let you have your seeds Romans chapter 5
[16:28] verse 5.
[16:34] we're going to continue on with the
[16:36] topic we've been on in Discerning true
[16:38] love this would be Discerning true love
[16:40] part four
[16:42] in uh
[16:44] we'll begin with Romans 5 5 we've read
[16:47] this several times but I want to stay in
[16:48] the same thought and go through the
[16:51] scripture again Romans chapter 5 verse 5
[16:53] and hope maketh not a shame because the
[16:56] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[16:59] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[17:02] amen you can have your seeds
[17:05] I want to start with this scripture
[17:07] because the things we've been talking
[17:08] about are so beyond human emotion
[17:11] they're so beyond human ability to love
[17:15] the right way amen because of the Fall
[17:18] everything within us in our human Spirit
[17:21] has been corrupted and so we have to
[17:23] have something more than just a human
[17:26] element
[17:27] and I'm so thankful that the love of God
[17:30] was shed in our abroad in our hearts by
[17:32] the Holy Ghost because this love that
[17:34] we're talking about is the love of God
[17:36] it is not a human love a human love
[17:40] Master it is not a human love uh
[17:44] um uh grown or perfected it's not that
[17:46] at all it's the love of God
[17:48] it's superior to the human element
[17:52] and so before that I just want to say
[17:54] that we've had a busy weekend thus far
[17:56] uh Friday night we were privileged to be
[17:59] at the Bible Believers Christian School
[18:00] graduation ceremony and we were able to
[18:03] take part in that we thank God for that
[18:04] and we got to see Abby baumgarners at
[18:08] Golden and Julie Hatfield all graduate
[18:10] so congratulations and God bless you all
[18:12] it's good to see that also my son David
[18:15] lamb graduates this year from homeschool
[18:18] and and then we have a college graduate
[18:20] Alex I believe
[18:23] um Alex Bartram graduated from college
[18:25] so God bless you all we wish God's
[18:27] blessing upon you and may God direct
[18:29] your steps from here forward amen
[18:32] amen so that was good that was Friday
[18:33] evening and then yesterday we traveled
[18:36] down to the Dayton area for the memorial
[18:38] service for sister Donna Howard's
[18:40] parents for her father Robert and her
[18:42] mother Susan Hageman and we all know the
[18:45] the difficult circumstances by which her
[18:47] father passed away her mother had passed
[18:50] away in 2021 and because of covert
[18:53] restrictions at the time it was
[18:55] difficult to have a memorial service
[18:56] that they never did have a proper
[18:58] memorial service so they decided to
[19:00] combine the two so we were there and it
[19:03] was a good time and I thank God that we
[19:05] were able to go down and also I thank
[19:07] God for all of you who are able to
[19:08] travel there was quite a number that
[19:10] were able from the church to go down to
[19:12] support sister Donna and her family and
[19:14] I just want to say God bless you that
[19:16] was wonderful
[19:17] also yesterday the youth had a fun day
[19:20] and I saw a few pictures and it looks
[19:22] like they had some fun and so they had a
[19:25] fun day yesterday this is a fun weekend
[19:26] for them and then this afternoon they'll
[19:29] have a youth meeting but the cow be
[19:30] ministering his home again for them this
[19:32] afternoon and then tomorrow we'll have
[19:34] the Memorial Day picnic and so I hope to
[19:36] see you all there and so I just I
[19:39] appreciate the fellowship and I enjoy
[19:40] our time together and that'll be at
[19:42] brother Ben and sister Amanda siebolt's
[19:44] home tomorrow so there's a lot happening
[19:47] this weekend but praise God Amen we get
[19:51] to see each other more
[19:52] I like that not less but more also I
[19:55] wanted to let you know that on the
[19:57] weekend of June 10th and 11th I will be
[20:00] traveling to Edmonton Alberta Canada to
[20:03] preach for brother Eugene Braun I'll be
[20:05] doing weekend meetings there June 10th
[20:07] and 11th and while I'm gone brother
[20:09] Nathaniel sius will be ministering here
[20:11] so be praying for that brother Nathaniel
[20:13] and his family will come and join in
[20:16] here
[20:17] so as we go back to this subject that
[20:19] we've been looking on and Discerning
[20:21] true love part four I'd like to take as
[20:24] a subtitle when human love leads wrong
[20:28] when human love leads wrong and I want
[20:30] to look at some examples of that in the
[20:32] scripture and and we find that
[20:36] this is just where my mind has been what
[20:39] God's been dealing with me sometimes the
[20:41] greatest deception is the deception
[20:43] inside me
[20:46] sometimes the hardest discernment is the
[20:49] discernment of me
[20:51] because the scripture says man's heart
[20:54] is deceitfully wicked who can know it
[20:57] and and so we have The Human Side of us
[21:01] that we still deal with there's the
[21:03] human nature and there's a human love
[21:05] and an affection memory conscious
[21:07] reasoning and affection and all that and
[21:09] and you know we're always trying to
[21:11] discern the world around us and discern
[21:13] what's going on and we always want to do
[21:15] the right thing that's the children of
[21:16] God we have a desire to do the right
[21:18] thing but I find many times the the the
[21:21] the discernment that trips me up is when
[21:23] I fail to discern myself
[21:26] and so I like I told you before I I the
[21:29] one that I'm afraid of most is me
[21:32] because brother Venom said my greatest
[21:33] enemy is William Branham so my greatest
[21:35] enemy would be Chad Lamb
[21:37] and so I I think it's it's good when we
[21:40] recognize that and it puts us in a bit
[21:42] of desperation and Desperation is not a
[21:45] bad thing for the children of God Amen
[21:47] we try to avoid desperation but
[21:48] desperation drives us to Christ with a
[21:51] total dependency upon him and that by
[21:54] his Spirit he will guide us the right
[21:55] way because without his spirit I will go
[21:58] the wrong way
[21:58] [Music]
[22:00] so I need that so as we're looking at
[22:03] this let's go over to First John chapter
[22:05] four we read this scripture last time uh
[22:09] on Wednesday and I I just so enjoyed it
[22:12] I want to look at it again
[22:14] first John chapter 4
[22:20] verse 7.
[22:28] I was telling Franco in the back this
[22:30] has been a busy weekend we had the
[22:32] Friday night we ministered at the the
[22:34] graduation yesterday we ministered at
[22:37] the memorial service then today and I
[22:40] said if brother bam said the
[22:41] congregation is 50 I said maybe today
[22:43] they need to be 60 or 65.
[22:46] so I could use a little bit of help
[22:48] today amen it's been busy but praise God
[22:50] my heart is full amen and I want to
[22:53] share what's on my heart so first John 4
[22:55] 7 beloved let us love one another for
[22:58] love is of God and everyone that loveth
[23:01] is born of God and knoweth God
[23:03] he that loveth not knoweth not God for
[23:06] God is love
[23:07] and this was manifest the love of God
[23:09] toward us because that God's sin has
[23:11] only begotten son into the world that we
[23:13] might live through him here in his love
[23:16] not that we loved God but that he loved
[23:19] us and sent his son to be a propitiation
[23:21] for our sins beloved if God so loved us
[23:25] we ought also to love one another no man
[23:28] has seen God at any time if we love one
[23:31] another God dwelleth in us
[23:34] and his love is perfected in US hereby
[23:37] know we that we that we dwell in him and
[23:40] he and us because he hath given us of
[23:43] his spirit
[23:44] this kind of love is only possible by
[23:47] his spirit
[23:48] by his spirit is the only thing that
[23:50] will give us the ability to love the way
[23:52] that the scriptures instruct us to in
[23:54] love
[23:55] human love won't accomplish this but the
[23:57] love of God will and so we see in verse
[23:59] 12 no man has seen God at any time if we
[24:02] love one another God dwelleth in us he's
[24:05] saying nobody has seen God but if we
[24:08] love one another God dwelleth in us so
[24:10] you can see where God's dwelling and
[24:12] where God's acting out of by the love
[24:14] that the Brethren have one for another
[24:17] and so the the then God dwelleth in us
[24:20] and his love is perfected in us or his
[24:23] love is coming to fullness or completion
[24:26] in us this is the the this is the final
[24:29] stage of the final work of the
[24:31] manifestation of the revealing of the
[24:34] mystery of God
[24:35] and it's taking place in Bride form it's
[24:37] taking place in a mini membered body
[24:39] around the world where now that love
[24:42] that God has been displaying through
[24:44] time is now making a final display in
[24:47] the Gentile dispensation and it's it's
[24:49] coming to completion in US
[24:52] and he's saying if we love one another
[24:54] then then God dwelleth in us and we know
[24:57] that when we talk about the stature of a
[24:59] perfect man how we're growing into this
[25:01] image of Christ into the likeness of
[25:04] Christ into the stature of a perfect man
[25:06] growing in all things unto the head
[25:08] which is Christ that we will be the
[25:10] bride will be his reflection upon Earth
[25:12] uh sharing his character displaying his
[25:15] character in the Earth
[25:18] but it's going to take him doing it
[25:20] because we can't
[25:22] so that love is is coming perfect in us
[25:25] and as we as we go up the pyramid the
[25:29] brotherly kindness or Brotherly Love is
[25:31] just before amen the Capstone or the
[25:33] fullness of love and it's amazing that
[25:36] all of these attributes amen must be
[25:39] expressed in opposition to the attribute
[25:44] it makes sense
[25:45] faith is expressed in a world with no
[25:48] faith where unbelief is Faith is
[25:50] expressed so even at the base faith is
[25:53] expressed in the opposition to Faith
[25:55] brings the expression of faith
[25:58] the opposition of patience the
[26:00] impatience of the world Amen displays
[26:02] the patience of God the the lack of
[26:05] temperance the lack of self-control in
[26:06] society amen displays the the control of
[26:10] God the self-control the temperance of
[26:12] God so the all of these things are
[26:15] displayed in the opposition of the very
[26:17] thing that's be displayed amen so when
[26:19] we come into Satan's Eden where man's uh
[26:22] uh where love is gone grow man's love is
[26:25] waxed cold amen and and there's anything
[26:27] seemingly no more proper love no more
[26:30] even natural affection Amen in the
[26:32] opposition of love God will show pure
[26:35] love
[26:37] amen and so sometimes in order to show
[26:39] Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness
[26:41] there must be an opposition to brotherly
[26:44] kindness for the display of Brotherly
[26:46] kindness
[26:47] and we think that that uh you know we
[26:50] think that every trouble in the church
[26:52] and every trouble between Brethren amen
[26:54] is a terrible thing and it is a terrible
[26:56] thing if it goes unresolved but what it
[26:58] should do is bring out a greater love it
[27:02] should bring the manifestation of
[27:03] Brotherly kindness
[27:05] so when will I leave brotherly kindness
[27:07] when my brother needs the display of
[27:10] Brotherly kindness
[27:12] so these things are many times found in
[27:14] the opposition amen so when when things
[27:17] happen and things have to be dealt with
[27:19] and we have to talk with one another and
[27:21] we have to come back in Harmony and
[27:23] unity it's the perfect opportunity for
[27:25] the love of God to be displayed in US we
[27:29] shouldn't run away from those things but
[27:30] we should draw near to them amen and say
[27:33] God move me in the right way Amen to
[27:36] display brotherly kindness in this
[27:38] situation because I can see this
[27:40] situation is going to require a better
[27:43] greater love than human love
[27:46] amen
[27:48] so we can see that
[27:51] many times human love will lead us the
[27:53] wrong way
[27:54] and many times human love will lead us
[27:57] exactly contrary to God's love
[28:00] because many times God's love being
[28:01] expressed is a mystery to us
[28:04] and I want to look at that through the
[28:05] word it's very mysterious the way
[28:07] sometimes God expresses his love
[28:10] and and human Love Can can bring us into
[28:14] the direct opposition to the word of God
[28:17] brother Brown says in the message God
[28:19] projecting his love he says now love is
[28:21] in two different words two different
[28:23] meanings and the Greek one of them is
[28:25] called filio that's the love that you
[28:27] have for your wife Agape is the love
[28:29] divine love now the love that you have
[28:31] for your wife and the love of God Is So
[28:34] contrary
[28:36] that's amazing
[28:37] because the love that we have for our
[28:39] spouse is one of the strongest loves
[28:41] that humans experience
[28:44] but the love of God is even contrary to
[28:47] that
[28:48] it's even far superior to that that it
[28:51] that it acts sometimes contrary to that
[28:54] love
[28:56] he said just listen to this the love
[28:58] that you have for your wife if a man
[29:00] went and saw her you would kill him on
[29:02] the spot with that kind of love he says
[29:05] in another place that love will create
[29:07] jealousy
[29:08] well jealousy amen it that kind of
[29:12] jealousy that brings rage and hatred is
[29:14] wrong
[29:16] right
[29:17] that kind of he says that would kill him
[29:19] on the spot with that kind of love
[29:21] affiliate love but with Agape o love
[29:23] you'd pray for his lost soul that'd be
[29:26] the difference there's two different
[29:27] types of love and I'm almost sure that
[29:29] many of us has been deceived with having
[29:31] filial love and thinking it's agapio
[29:34] love
[29:35] that's the truth
[29:37] I can say it's the truth because it's
[29:38] been true in me many many times that I
[29:41] thought this was genuine love and it was
[29:43] love it was a form of love amen but it
[29:46] was a weaker form of love amen and when
[29:49] I find that sometimes that love was in
[29:51] contrast or working contrary to perfect
[29:54] love
[29:56] amen many times a man you know that when
[29:59] he talks about this uh filial love that
[30:01] would would cause a man to be enraged
[30:04] over the love of his wife and cause a
[30:06] man to kill a man on the spot amen we
[30:09] know that that's not the nature of
[30:11] Christ
[30:12] so that kind of love moved us away from
[30:14] Christ
[30:16] that kind of love though it's it's it's
[30:18] a real love that we have in the human
[30:21] emotion in the human side it's a real
[30:23] love amen that love moved us in contrast
[30:25] to the nature of Christ and that love
[30:28] this is an extreme example but that love
[30:30] in many other ways can move us in
[30:32] contrast to the nature of Christ
[30:35] so we we have to be careful that we we
[30:37] know God we know his word amen and we
[30:41] discern by the spirit of discernment by
[30:43] the spirit of Christ
[30:45] so we we know that many times these
[30:48] things would motivate us to do the wrong
[30:50] amen but the problem is when they come
[30:53] religiously
[30:56] and it's still a filial love but it's un
[30:59] and religious tones and can still move
[31:02] us contrary to the nature of Christ
[31:06] this kind of love though it looks like
[31:09] it's a love that's based on the love of
[31:13] another human being it's actually still
[31:16] has its Center focus in the love of self
[31:19] because you insulted my wife
[31:23] when you insulted my wife you insulted
[31:26] me
[31:28] you hurt my child when you hurt my child
[31:31] you hurt me so so this kind of love is
[31:35] that that drives this kind of bitterness
[31:37] and this kind of hatred and this kind of
[31:39] anger and that kind of love that drives
[31:42] that it looks like that you're loving
[31:44] your child or you're loving your wife or
[31:46] you're loving this or that but really
[31:48] when you get down to the core of it
[31:50] you're still loving self because
[31:51] somebody insulted your child
[31:54] not just a random child in the world but
[31:56] your child amen and when they offended
[31:58] your child they offended you
[32:01] and now amen instead of discerning this
[32:04] this rage it can bring a frustration
[32:06] range anger bitterness uh contempt it
[32:09] can bring all of these things that are
[32:10] contrary to the nature of Christ
[32:12] and we think it's Justified because
[32:14] that's my child that's my wife that's
[32:16] the one I love so much
[32:18] amen
[32:19] but that may be your child that may be
[32:23] your wife that may be this but the
[32:25] person who who maybe unintentionally
[32:27] caused the offense is your brother
[32:32] so can you slay your brother to protect
[32:35] your wife
[32:40] amen
[32:42] you see it gets down pretty tight
[32:47] and so
[32:48] brother bam also says
[32:51] for someone asked me not long ago isn't
[32:53] Satan a creator
[32:54] I said no sir God is the only Creator
[32:57] there is one Creator is gone he said
[32:59] well how did Evil ever get here then if
[33:02] Satan didn't create it
[33:04] I said evil is not a creation
[33:07] he said Satan cannot create but he can
[33:09] pervert what God has created
[33:11] brother bear says somewhere else evil is
[33:13] righteousness perverted
[33:15] he didn't create evil amen God never
[33:19] created evil amen but but the the devil
[33:22] Satan took righteousness and perverted
[33:25] it and when he took righteousness and
[33:27] perverted it it became evil
[33:29] amen he's not a Creator God is the
[33:33] creator but Satan perverts what God has
[33:34] created and God created good and Satan
[33:37] perverted it to evil and it's just like
[33:39] any other thing it's perverted it's
[33:40] wrong so God created love God's the
[33:43] originator of God is love but Satan can
[33:45] pervert love
[33:48] amen
[33:49] so he can take what God has made and he
[33:52] can pervert it amen
[33:55] brother Benham says in God hiding
[33:57] himself in Simplicity he says science is
[33:58] all right as far as it goes your five
[34:01] senses is fine and dandy as long as it
[34:04] agrees with the word
[34:05] but when the five senses condemn the
[34:07] word then get away from it
[34:09] he goes on to say in the greatest battle
[34:11] ever fought if you've got your senses
[34:14] see taste feel smell here they're all
[34:16] right but don't trust them
[34:19] unless they agree with the word
[34:22] all right they're all right but if they
[34:24] disagree with the word don't you listen
[34:26] to them
[34:27] now imaginations conscience memory
[34:30] reasoning and affections they're all
[34:32] right if they agree with the word but if
[34:34] your affections doesn't agree with the
[34:36] word get rid of it
[34:38] this word affections is another word for
[34:40] love it's another type of love amen if
[34:43] this if this affections doesn't agree
[34:45] with the word he says get rid of it
[34:48] and am I not supposed to be affection am
[34:50] I not supposed to have love absolutely
[34:52] the love of God Amen but if the love
[34:54] that you're feeling is moving you
[34:56] contrary to the word of God to the
[34:58] nature of Christ then get rid of that
[35:00] love that love is a motivation to go the
[35:02] wrong way that love somehow somewhere
[35:05] has been perverted by Satan himself to
[35:08] cause you to move away from the word not
[35:10] to the word
[35:13] amen
[35:15] uh I I hope as we move along amen you'll
[35:19] be able to that I I just hope that God
[35:21] will be able to take what he's put in my
[35:23] heart and put it in your heart because
[35:24] words are not sufficient there's no way
[35:26] amen I know what God has dealt with me
[35:28] on and I know what it means to me and I
[35:30] know how deep it's gone into my heart
[35:32] amen but I can't with words do that kind
[35:34] of deep heart surgery in anyone else
[35:37] it's going to take the working of the
[35:39] Holy Spirit to take what he's dealt in
[35:41] me in my heart amen and deal it with you
[35:43] in the same way so that it comes out
[35:45] correct not incorrect amen because uh
[35:47] one thing that always worries me so much
[35:49] in preaching amen is the human element
[35:51] that I can present something Amen in
[35:54] such a way by my own my own words my own
[35:56] way and cause somebody to misunderstand
[35:59] a little bit this way or a little bit
[36:00] that way and I so don't want to do that
[36:02] amen I want to yield myself to God so
[36:05] that he just speaks what he wants even
[36:06] if I don't comprehend it in my mind so
[36:08] that he can plant it in the heart and
[36:10] bring the correct understanding the
[36:12] right way
[36:14] I don't want to bring a misunderstanding
[36:16] I don't want to go I don't want to I
[36:18] don't want to inject myself amen and
[36:20] when you're a human being I mean how in
[36:22] the world do you avoid that
[36:24] preaching is tough
[36:27] but what I want is I want God
[36:29] to to work in our hearts
[36:32] to bring us
[36:34] into the image of Christ
[36:37] Paul says I travail again with you
[36:41] till Christ be formed in you what was
[36:44] Paul trying to get where was he trying
[36:46] to take the church he was trying to take
[36:47] to the church to the place where Christ
[36:49] is formed in you
[36:51] to where this great mystery would be
[36:52] revealed which is Christ in you the hope
[36:54] of glory
[36:56] amen
[36:58] I believe it's a deeper work for me it's
[37:00] a deeper work than I originally realized
[37:03] I thought I was going to understand a
[37:05] few doctrinal teachings and and I was
[37:07] going to understand what happened in the
[37:08] Garden of Eden and serpent C to
[37:10] understand the godhead and all that and
[37:11] then I'd kick out my TV and I stopped
[37:13] wearing shorts and I wouldn't say any
[37:15] bad language and wouldn't say any uh bad
[37:17] jokes and I I wouldn't and then I was
[37:19] going to be okay
[37:21] but I realized that's not okay that God
[37:23] actually wants to bring me into His
[37:26] Image God actually wants Christ he wants
[37:28] Christ to be manifest in me and it's
[37:31] going to take a complete death to self
[37:33] and a surrender of things I didn't even
[37:35] know I needed to surrender
[37:38] things that I had no understanding that
[37:41] were still roadblocks and still barriers
[37:43] deep within deep within the Flesh of
[37:46] John amen I thought I had surrendered
[37:48] all and I had surrendered all to the
[37:51] amount of all that I understood at the
[37:53] time I surrendered
[37:55] but then I found a little more that
[37:57] needed to be surrendered and then I
[37:58] found a little more that needed to be
[38:00] surrendered and that's why we keep
[38:02] coming back to church for the preaching
[38:03] of the word so that word can discern us
[38:06] and cut us amen and it can be a sharp
[38:08] two-edged sword that can defy the spirit
[38:10] and the soul and say this part is not
[38:12] what God wants this is the part that he
[38:14] wants
[38:17] amen and we can walk away I know for me
[38:20] when I look at these things I become
[38:22] overwhelmed sometimes and think God how
[38:25] am I going to manifest that amen but
[38:27] then I look at the hour we live in in
[38:29] the age that we're called to and the
[38:31] manifestation of the word that he's
[38:33] portrayed displayed in our day and I
[38:35] said what other hour what other
[38:37] generation what other people is going to
[38:40] make this new testament live
[38:43] it's in the word amen it must be lived
[38:47] it must be on display there must be a
[38:49] people that God will call to this
[38:51] manifestation and he will supply the
[38:54] means and the means is the word and
[38:56] faith in his word and now the spirit of
[38:58] the word will come on top of that and
[39:00] water the word and bring it to
[39:01] manifestation
[39:04] amen
[39:07] let's go to John chapter 11 together
[39:10] the Gospel of John chapter 11.
[39:13] let's just start looking at a few places
[39:17] in the word places we know places that
[39:19] are familiar but I just want to look at
[39:21] them once again
[39:23] John 11
[39:25] and 1.
[39:35] now a certain man was sick named Lazarus
[39:38] of Bethany the town of Mary and her
[39:40] sister Martha it was that Mary which
[39:42] anointed the Lord with ointment and
[39:43] wiped his feet with her hair whose
[39:45] brother Lazarus was sick
[39:47] therefore his sister sent unto him
[39:49] saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest
[39:52] is sick
[39:54] when Jesus heard that he said this
[39:56] sickness is not unto death but for the
[39:58] glory of God and the Son of God might be
[40:00] glorified thereby
[40:02] so immediately Jesus already knows the
[40:06] purpose of the sickness
[40:09] the purpose is not death even though we
[40:11] know that Lazarus is going to die in the
[40:14] flesh
[40:17] now look at verse 5 now Jesus loved
[40:19] Martha and her sister and Lazarus
[40:22] Jesus loved them
[40:24] and when he had heard therefore that he
[40:26] was sick he Abode two days still in the
[40:29] same place where he was
[40:32] the part that becomes mysterious
[40:34] when humans look at it
[40:38] Jesus loved Martha and her sister in
[40:41] Lazarus and Those whom you love there's
[40:44] a notification that comes that says
[40:46] Lazarus is sick amen and Jesus delays
[40:51] two days
[40:52] instead of going to the one he loved
[40:55] because Jesus could raise him up Jesus
[40:57] could heal him he could cast off this
[40:59] sickness and deliver his friend who's
[41:00] Afflicted with sickness instead of
[41:02] moving amen the love of God had him stay
[41:05] and not go
[41:08] but human love doesn't comprehend this
[41:10] how can you allow a man to lay in agony
[41:13] and suffer in sickness when you can
[41:15] deliver him how can you stay here when
[41:18] you know he needs you what was holding
[41:21] him the love of God was holding him
[41:27] the human beings surrounding this didn't
[41:30] even comprehend this
[41:33] but this is a Higher Love
[41:37] then after that saith he to his
[41:39] disciples let us go into Judea again I'm
[41:42] sorry yeah when he heard these things
[41:44] that he was sick he Abode two days still
[41:46] in the same place where he was then
[41:48] after that he saith to disciples let us
[41:50] go into Judea again his disciples said
[41:53] to him Master the Jews of late sought to
[41:55] Stone thee and goest thou hither again
[41:57] Jesus answered are they not 12 are there
[41:59] not 12 hours in the day if any man walk
[42:01] in the day he's stumbleth not because he
[42:03] seeth the light of this world but if a
[42:06] man walk in the night he stumbles
[42:07] because there is no light in him
[42:10] these things said he and after that he
[42:12] saith unto them our friend Lazarus
[42:15] sleepeth but I go that I may awake him
[42:18] out of sleep
[42:19] then said his disciples Lord if he sleep
[42:22] he shall do well I'll be it Jesus spake
[42:24] of his death but they thought that he
[42:26] had spoken of taking of rest and sleep
[42:29] then said Jesus unto them plainly
[42:31] Lazarus is dead
[42:35] and I am glad for your sakes that I was
[42:38] not there
[42:43] think about
[42:45] sometimes we have to stop and back away
[42:47] from the Bible for a second
[42:49] and think about Jesus heard he got
[42:52] notification in time to go to Lazarus to
[42:55] prevent lazar's death
[42:57] but he knew that there's a purpose in
[42:59] this so the love of God constrained him
[43:01] because there's a greater good remember
[43:03] the love of God is is is as a long
[43:07] foresight
[43:08] the love of God sees from the beginning
[43:10] to the end and knows what's best not
[43:13] what's convenient not what's easy but it
[43:16] always does what's best
[43:19] for the ones that it loves
[43:21] and so now he tells them lies are asleep
[43:26] and I go to wake him he knew what his
[43:27] purpose was he knew what he was supposed
[43:28] to do and I go wake him amen and then
[43:31] there they misunderstand that so he has
[43:33] to come out very plainly in the way they
[43:34] could understand and said Lazarus is
[43:36] dead
[43:37] and when it when they say Lazarus is
[43:39] dead he says and for your sakes for you
[43:42] because I love you for your sakes I'm
[43:44] glad I wasn't there
[43:47] but when you go to the flip side and you
[43:49] go to Bethany and you go to the home of
[43:52] Martha and Mary and Lazarus what were
[43:54] those two days like for them
[43:57] what was the passing of the brother like
[43:59] for them did they feel loved did they
[44:02] feel that the love of Jesus Christ was
[44:05] it a warm fuzzy feeling when they went
[44:07] and sent word but he didn't come I don't
[44:09] know why he didn't come maybe he's
[44:11] delayed maybe something's wrong if he
[44:13] would come this would be over amen and
[44:15] we know that they expressed that Faith
[44:16] because they said had you been here he
[44:18] would have lived
[44:20] so they've got questions they've got
[44:22] misunderstandings amen that they may
[44:25] have disappointments I don't know amen
[44:27] but they're real people with real
[44:28] emotions on the other side of Jesus
[44:31] delaying two days and telling his
[44:32] disciples for your sakes there's going
[44:34] to be something you need to see and you
[44:36] need to experience and God has allowed
[44:38] this for your benefit and this is the
[44:40] overall love of God
[44:43] and it may not felt loving to Martha and
[44:46] Mary
[44:51] but he was directed by God
[44:56] in verse 15 again I'm glad for your
[44:58] sakes
[45:00] that I was not there to the intent you
[45:02] may believe
[45:04] nevertheless let us go to him
[45:07] let's skip down to verse 32.
[45:12] then when Mary was come where Jesus was
[45:15] and saw him she fell down at his feet
[45:16] saying unto him Lord if thou had been
[45:19] here my brother had not died
[45:22] she knew that he would raise him
[45:26] she called for him and he did not come
[45:31] how many times have we called for him
[45:32] and it seemed like he didn't come
[45:35] we asked for an immediate deliverance
[45:37] and it didn't come immediately
[45:39] we asked for the situation to change and
[45:41] God allowed it to continue
[45:45] and we need to break away from human
[45:48] emotion to recognize the love of God
[45:51] because we can feel disappointed
[45:54] if we're really honest with ourselves we
[45:56] have felt disappointed in God
[46:00] we have felt neglected
[46:04] overlooked
[46:06] not cared about
[46:07] That's The Human Side
[46:10] those are the emotions that we go
[46:11] through we wanted a deliverance we
[46:13] wanted an answer we knew God could
[46:16] Martha knew that he could
[46:19] if you had been here he had not died
[46:21] I know that God could change the
[46:23] situation in my life and a fraction of a
[46:25] second everything could end he's got the
[46:28] power he has the ability there's no
[46:30] question in that and I know he loves me
[46:32] and I know he's able and I don't
[46:33] understand why he doesn't change it job
[46:35] was suffering through those kind of
[46:37] questions I'm righteous I don't know why
[46:39] he's allowing this to happen to me
[46:41] and we go through the whole emotional
[46:44] cycle sometimes of a trial when we
[46:47] sometimes have to back up and put this
[46:49] thing down amen and quiet it down and
[46:52] say it doesn't matter amen God knows
[46:55] what's best for me and I put my trust in
[46:57] him completely this is the love of God
[47:00] to me
[47:02] doesn't have to feel like it for me to
[47:05] recognize it
[47:07] [Music]
[47:09] so
[47:10] this true love
[47:12] sometimes so contrary to human love
[47:17] that it can be quite shocking sometimes
[47:21] remember we spoke a couple
[47:23] uh
[47:24] weeks ago
[47:26] about Jesus looking at Peter and he says
[47:29] this in Luke 22 verse 31 and the Lord
[47:31] said Simon Simon behold
[47:34] Satan hath desired to have you that he
[47:37] may sift you as wheat
[47:39] but I have prayed for thee that thy
[47:41] faith fail not
[47:42] and when that are converted strengthened
[47:44] the brethren
[47:47] I can imagine if I think if I was Simon
[47:50] and Jesus told me that
[47:53] one of my reactions that I think now I
[47:56] may not think there in the moment when
[47:57] Jesus is speaking you might just keep
[47:58] quiet and say nothing
[48:00] but as I reflect on it now I'd say well
[48:02] God don't let him sift me as wheat
[48:05] couldn't you stop him
[48:08] but see Peter needed to be sifted as
[48:11] wheat
[48:13] Peter needed something inside of him to
[48:17] change he needed his own desperation
[48:21] and he tells Peter Satan hath desired to
[48:25] have you
[48:26] Satan hath desire to have you to sift
[48:28] you as wheat this whole language it
[48:31] lends itself to believe that he was
[48:33] seeking permission
[48:35] Satan has desired thee to Sifty his weed
[48:39] so he he's seeking permission to try
[48:42] Peter it was Simon at the time and or
[48:45] Peter and he's seeking permission and it
[48:48] appears to the context that he's granted
[48:50] permission
[48:52] and what is this this is love
[48:57] and we know what the sifting was like
[48:59] for Peter when he denied the Lord when
[49:01] he went out in great Agony amen after he
[49:04] denied and denied with cursings and went
[49:05] and wept bitterly amen none of that felt
[49:08] good
[49:09] for Peter
[49:11] none of that was emotionally warm and
[49:14] emotionally uh it wasn't warm feelings
[49:18] of love it wasn't euphoric it wasn't it
[49:21] you know what I mean it wasn't the
[49:23] cuddly I feel loved but it was the love
[49:25] of God bringing Peter to the position
[49:28] that Peter needs to be in because
[49:30] there's a love that has foresight
[49:32] there's a love that knows the end the
[49:34] beginning and there's a love amen that
[49:36] will not forego anything until it brings
[49:38] us into God's desired end for us
[49:43] that's why I've told people before I
[49:46] I've sat with many of you and we talked
[49:48] about difficult circumstances difficult
[49:50] trials in life
[49:52] and I've made the statement many times
[49:54] this is why God does not ask pastors for
[49:58] permission to put sheep in trials
[50:01] because pastors would always say oh no
[50:03] Lord don't don't do it please don't
[50:06] don't do that to their family don't
[50:08] don't let them go through that spare
[50:09] them Lord spare them Lord spare them
[50:11] Lord but that's why God never comes to
[50:13] the pastor and says hey is it all right
[50:14] no he just does it anyways amen because
[50:17] because in my heart I would say Lord no
[50:20] not not them not now don't no but God
[50:24] loves in a higher love where he won't
[50:26] spare anything to bring us to perfection
[50:31] we also spoke a little time back about
[50:33] the Apostle Paul
[50:35] when he was given a thorn in the flesh a
[50:38] messenger of the devil
[50:41] he says in second Corinthians 12 7 and
[50:44] lest I should be exalted above measure
[50:46] through the abundance of the revelations
[50:47] there was given to me a thorn in the
[50:49] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[50:52] me lest I should be exalted above
[50:53] measure for this thing I besought the
[50:56] Lord Thrice that it might depart from me
[50:58] and he said unto me my grace is
[51:01] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[51:02] made perfect in weakness
[51:04] most gladly therefore will I rather
[51:06] glory in my infirmities that the power
[51:09] of Christ May rest upon me
[51:12] Paul was given a little insight into his
[51:14] trial
[51:15] God had told him that I have done this
[51:18] for your welfare for your benefit
[51:20] and then he began to in glory in his
[51:22] infirmities and I I truly want to
[51:26] recognize
[51:27] in my life that the Lord does everything
[51:29] well
[51:30] the Lord does everything well his love
[51:32] for me never changes amen and and he he
[51:35] has foresight for me and vision and I
[51:39] don't want to let the human love in me
[51:42] interpret what's happening I want Divine
[51:44] love to interpret what's happening in my
[51:46] life
[51:48] I want to have a higher vision
[51:50] let's go to Mark chapter 10 together and
[51:52] look at another
[51:54] passage of scripture
[52:17] in Mark chapter 10
[52:20] verse 17.
[52:22] this is the story of the Rich Young
[52:24] Ruler
[52:26] and when he was going forth into the way
[52:27] there came one running and kneeling to
[52:29] him and asked him good Master what shall
[52:31] I do that I may inherit eternal life
[52:34] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[52:36] me good there is none good but one that
[52:39] is gone
[52:40] thou knowest the Commandments do not
[52:41] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[52:43] do not bear false witness defraud not
[52:45] honor thy father and mother
[52:48] and he answered and said unto him master
[52:50] all these have I observed from my youth
[52:54] then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[52:57] said unto him one thing thou lackest I
[53:00] want to stop for just a second
[53:04] verse 21 in the beginning then Jesus
[53:06] beholding him loved him
[53:09] when Jesus loved him Jesus didn't say oh
[53:13] you're a good boy you're good
[53:14] everything's fine with you God loves you
[53:16] you're okay
[53:18] that's not what Jesus loved for this
[53:20] young man did
[53:22] but the love that he had for this young
[53:24] man would go to his very heart and root
[53:26] out the very problem the very need that
[53:28] he had to surrender in a greater way not
[53:31] keep covering for him and saying you're
[53:33] fine you're fine you're fine
[53:36] you can see how you know many times
[53:39] human love can lead us the wrong way and
[53:42] human love can be contrary to the will
[53:44] and love of God and even so much that
[53:47] that we as ministers or even mothers or
[53:49] fathers in the home amen we can we can
[53:52] cover for our children
[53:55] you're fine God loves you you're you're
[53:57] in our home you're one of my kids you're
[53:59] going to be okay no you're not okay
[54:01] until you surrendered all
[54:03] you're not okay until you've sold
[54:06] everything and given to the poor and
[54:07] taken up your cross and follow Jesus
[54:09] you're not okay because I say you're
[54:10] okay you're not okay because you're in
[54:12] my home you're not okay because you sit
[54:13] in this church you're only okay when
[54:15] you're okay
[54:17] and you're only okay when Jesus love has
[54:20] gone down and rooted the very problem
[54:22] that you have in your heart and gotten
[54:23] down to the thing that you need to
[54:25] surrender most and cause you to make a
[54:27] full surrender that's only when love is
[54:30] expressed
[54:32] but to constantly say oh you're you're
[54:34] fine you're wonderful you're great
[54:36] you're you're okay no and and then
[54:39] especially when in the home you can see
[54:42] there's problems here there's needs here
[54:44] there there's a there's a lack of
[54:45] surrender and I'm not going to keep
[54:47] telling myself you're saved you're a
[54:49] Christian you're they're only a
[54:50] Christian when they're born again by the
[54:52] spirit of God they're not a Christian
[54:53] because they live in my home they're not
[54:54] a Christian because I call them a
[54:56] Christian and they're not a Christian
[54:57] because they keep the rules of the house
[55:02] and you can see how the love and when
[55:04] you when you see even one of your
[55:06] children start to get uh
[55:08] uh uh a little anxious for their own
[55:11] salvation and and God begins to deal
[55:14] with them amen sometimes we want to take
[55:15] away all their anxiety we want to say Oh
[55:17] no you're it's okay it's okay no
[55:19] sometimes they need to go through the
[55:21] trouble sometime and amen of seeking out
[55:24] their salvation with fear and trembling
[55:27] sometimes they need to to actually find
[55:30] out for themselves where they stand and
[55:31] it might take a little tumultuous time
[55:33] where we don't need to say Amen you're
[55:36] okay you're fine don't worry about it
[55:37] but you might say no ask God until God
[55:40] reveals it to you you're going to be
[55:41] okay in the end but you may have to go
[55:43] through a rough time but keep seeking
[55:45] him till he settles it in your heart
[55:48] keep pressing till you surrender it all
[55:50] keep moving
[55:52] because if we're not careful we can take
[55:54] the very the very work that God is doing
[55:57] and sugarcoat it and take it away
[56:06] see how love can be contrary
[56:08] human love can lead the wrong way and be
[56:10] contrary to the love of God
[56:14] we can see error and wrong and sin
[56:18] and just smooth it over
[56:20] because we love that person and we don't
[56:22] want to say anything we don't want to
[56:26] is that love
[56:29] when Jesus looked at this young man
[56:33] he loved him
[56:35] and when he loved him he said there's
[56:37] one thing that you lack
[56:40] let's read it
[56:44] in verse 21 then Jesus beholding him
[56:46] loved him and said unto him one thing
[56:48] thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever
[56:52] thou Hast give to the poor and thou
[56:54] shalt treasure in heaven and come take
[56:57] up the cross and follow me
[57:00] and he was sad at the saying and went
[57:02] away grieve for he had great possessions
[57:08] sad that he turned his back on the
[57:10] opportunity he had
[57:12] but I say at least he had the
[57:14] opportunity
[57:15] at least he heard the truth
[57:18] and at least Jesus told him
[57:20] what compelled Jesus to speak to his
[57:22] heart
[57:23] it was his love
[57:27] the young man says he says what must I
[57:29] do to inherit eternal life he says you
[57:32] know the Commandments
[57:33] don't I don't commit adultery don't
[57:36] steal you honor thy father money said
[57:37] I've done these for my youth and Jesus
[57:39] didn't say okay you're fine
[57:43] he went deeper
[57:45] so there's one thing that you're lacking
[57:49] you have to sell out yourself completely
[57:53] and give yourself completely to me you
[57:57] have to sell all of your possessions
[57:59] give it to the poor that means surrender
[58:02] your entire life
[58:04] give it away
[58:06] take up your cross which is an
[58:08] instrument of death
[58:11] and follow me
[58:13] that's what love spoke to the Rich Young
[58:16] Ruler that's what true love spoke to the
[58:19] original ruler
[58:22] let's go to John chapter 5.
[58:44] John chapter 5 verse 2.
[58:48] now there is a Jerusalem by the Sheep
[58:50] Market a pool which is called in the
[58:52] Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five
[58:54] porches and these leg a great multitude
[58:57] of impotent folk of blind halt withered
[59:00] waiting for the moving of the water
[59:02] for an angel went down at a certain
[59:04] season into the pool and troubled the
[59:06] water whosoever then first after the
[59:08] troubling of the water stepped in was
[59:10] made whole of whatsoever disease he had
[59:13] and a certain man was there which had an
[59:15] infirmity 30 and eight years when Jesus
[59:18] saw him lie and knew that he had been
[59:20] now a long time in that case he saith
[59:22] unto him will thou be made whole
[59:25] the impotent man answered him sir I have
[59:28] no man when the water is troubled to put
[59:30] me into the pool but while I am coming
[59:32] another stepping down before me Jesus
[59:34] saith in him rise take up thy bed and
[59:38] walk
[59:39] and immediately the man was made whole
[59:42] and took up his bed and walked and on
[59:44] the same day was the Sabbath
[59:46] brother Ben refers to the scripture many
[59:48] many times and he refers to the fact and
[59:51] draws our attention to the fact that
[59:52] there was multitudes of sick lame blind
[59:56] withered laying around this pool
[59:59] and although there was a great multitude
[1:00:00] Jesus went to one
[1:00:03] and this is what he says and I'm going
[1:00:05] to read from a couple places but in the
[1:00:06] message earnestly contending for the
[1:00:08] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:00:09] Saints he says now watch just a little
[1:00:11] further if you will one day he was going
[1:00:13] down to a pool called Bethesda and the
[1:00:16] Bible said great multitudes of impotent
[1:00:18] folk laid there watch what kind of
[1:00:20] people lame blind withered waiting for
[1:00:22] the moving of the water we're in Saint
[1:00:24] John 5 now great multitudes many times
[1:00:27] is what there's tonight maybe 10 times
[1:00:29] what's here they were all lame withered
[1:00:32] blind waiting for the moving or the
[1:00:33] water and just a few days after that
[1:00:36] woman touched His Garment there he came
[1:00:38] right down through that same pool walked
[1:00:40] by the blind walked by the lame he was
[1:00:43] full of compassion
[1:00:44] yes well why didn't he have compassion
[1:00:48] you mean to tell me the merciful Christ
[1:00:50] the anointed Emmanuel walking among lame
[1:00:53] halt withered and blind and never healed
[1:00:55] them
[1:00:57] now watch hold that in your mind
[1:00:59] sometimes you don't know what compassion
[1:01:01] means friend
[1:01:03] the people are so bound they don't
[1:01:05] understand Heavenly things we don't see
[1:01:07] compassion is to do the will of God not
[1:01:10] sympathy there's a lot of difference
[1:01:12] between sympathy and compassion now
[1:01:15] watch him just like love love comes in
[1:01:18] two categories
[1:01:19] we know what the two Greek words agapio
[1:01:21] and philio the filio love is Earthly
[1:01:23] like friendship agapio love is above
[1:01:25] just listen to this philia love is what
[1:01:27] you have for your wife your children
[1:01:28] that's filio now if someone insult your
[1:01:31] wife a Kind of Love would make you kill
[1:01:32] them the man insult your wife that's
[1:01:34] filio but agape love would make you pray
[1:01:36] for his lost soul that's the difference
[1:01:38] that's the way with human compassion and
[1:01:40] godly compassion compassion in the
[1:01:44] Realms of spirit means to do the will of
[1:01:46] him that sent you
[1:01:51] says there's a difference between
[1:01:53] sympathy and compassion
[1:01:55] and I started looking I looked it up
[1:01:57] just to see and and relate it to what
[1:01:59] brother Branham was saying
[1:02:01] sympathy is to feel sorry for somebody
[1:02:05] to have pity to feel sorry for somebody
[1:02:08] but compassion is to feel sorry for
[1:02:10] somebody with the desire to help
[1:02:15] okay now there can be a false compassion
[1:02:18] that comes with sympathy
[1:02:19] but there's a Godly compassion and a
[1:02:22] Godly compassion knows that the only way
[1:02:25] that I can help this person is by the
[1:02:27] word of God Amen there's this only thing
[1:02:29] is to give them the word of God because
[1:02:31] there's nothing else I can do to help
[1:02:33] them
[1:02:35] you think about uh brother Graham says
[1:02:38] it and sirs we would see Jesus there's
[1:02:40] two different types of compassion one of
[1:02:42] them is human sympathy the other one is
[1:02:43] Godly compassion Godly compassion is to
[1:02:46] do the will of God human sympathy throws
[1:02:48] everything into a puddle
[1:02:51] human sympathy messes everything up and
[1:02:53] if we could just relate it to uh
[1:02:55] something very practical in the word we
[1:02:58] know that God has promised us if we pay
[1:03:01] tithes if we pay tithes that he promised
[1:03:04] the blessing that we can't contain and
[1:03:06] he'll prevent the Devourer from
[1:03:08] devouring
[1:03:09] we know that is that the promise
[1:03:11] but sometimes we see brothers or sisters
[1:03:15] they get into some difficulty some
[1:03:16] hardship maybe a financial situation
[1:03:19] amen and we may not realize that the
[1:03:22] Devourer has come because God has
[1:03:24] allowed it because they're not faithful
[1:03:25] in their tithes
[1:03:28] and we were Symphony one sympathy want
[1:03:30] to relieve the pressure on our brother
[1:03:33] and sister and so we keep funneling
[1:03:35] money and funneling money and funneling
[1:03:37] money because that's what we should do
[1:03:38] as loving people right we should not let
[1:03:40] anybody suffer amen we should take away
[1:03:42] all suffering we have means to take away
[1:03:44] all suffering but the problem is amen
[1:03:47] they're out of the will of God out of
[1:03:49] the word of God and all of my human
[1:03:51] compassion is never going to fix this
[1:03:53] problem there's an empty well that money
[1:03:55] will not fix because the problem is a
[1:03:58] spiritual problem they're off the word
[1:04:01] and I need to talk to them enough to
[1:04:04] realize Hey listen I think I understand
[1:04:06] what's going on Amen have you been
[1:04:09] paying your time well no I I got a
[1:04:11] little behind and I'm this and that and
[1:04:12] the other and and and and you know
[1:04:15] there's always a reason
[1:04:18] but there's never a good reason
[1:04:22] and so I could say oh yeah it's all
[1:04:24] right we understand and this and that
[1:04:26] and let me help out listen that's not
[1:04:28] help
[1:04:30] that's not love
[1:04:32] is to say listen brother sister I love
[1:04:35] you
[1:04:36] listen but the problem that I see is
[1:04:39] you're not lined up to the word if you
[1:04:40] get lined up to the word God has
[1:04:42] promised a blessing
[1:04:44] and I don't have the power within myself
[1:04:48] to override God's word and if I attempt
[1:04:52] to now my love oh I hope you understand
[1:04:55] now my love is evil
[1:05:00] now my love is wrong I'm in error I'm
[1:05:03] contrary to the word
[1:05:06] because of human compassion
[1:05:10] that doesn't mean we don't help people
[1:05:11] out my goodness we help people all the
[1:05:13] time we want to help people but but and
[1:05:15] there's times that there's help needed
[1:05:16] there's scriptures for that
[1:05:19] but oh God help us to help the right way
[1:05:24] help us to be loving help us to love our
[1:05:27] brothers the way God loved the Rich
[1:05:28] Young Ruler
[1:05:30] the way Jesus Christ loved him help us
[1:05:31] to love one another that would help us
[1:05:33] to have true genuine love of God in our
[1:05:36] hearts
[1:05:37] and not feel like that not feel like
[1:05:41] because we keep doing things that we're
[1:05:43] good
[1:05:44] we keep relieving pressures we keep
[1:05:47] handing out that listen we may be going
[1:05:50] absolutely contrary to the word of God
[1:05:51] in that amen we need some discernment we
[1:05:54] need God to lead us by spiritual
[1:05:55] leadership and maybe we need to ask some
[1:05:57] questions sometimes
[1:06:01] and give real love
[1:06:04] because real love
[1:06:07] true love will always bring us back to
[1:06:09] the word
[1:06:10] because true correction will always
[1:06:12] bring us back to the word and true love
[1:06:13] is corrective
[1:06:19] men
[1:06:23] we thought I thought I shouldn't say we
[1:06:26] I don't want to include you in my error
[1:06:29] I thought
[1:06:31] coming to perfection
[1:06:34] coming into the statute of Christ would
[1:06:36] be so much easier
[1:06:39] I didn't realize it was going to cost me
[1:06:41] everything
[1:06:44] to lose all of self
[1:06:47] to surrender completely and to continue
[1:06:50] surrendering completely not a one-time
[1:06:53] surrender but a daily dying Paul says I
[1:06:56] Die daily
[1:07:01] and looking for Jesus in 1954 he says
[1:07:04] then when he was found in the temple
[1:07:06] rejoicing the Jews questioned him now
[1:07:08] this is Saint John the fifth Chapter 19
[1:07:10] Verse listen closely I questioned well
[1:07:13] why didn't he heal all those people
[1:07:15] we're still to pull the Bethesda if he
[1:07:17] was a great healer why didn't he make
[1:07:19] all those crippled people he passed
[1:07:21] right through them if he was full of
[1:07:23] love why didn't he have compassion on
[1:07:25] them
[1:07:27] people don't know what compassion is
[1:07:29] compassion and love is the will of God
[1:07:33] and you can this this is the statement
[1:07:36] us all stop pinch ourselves said that
[1:07:39] one time I want to use it pinch
[1:07:41] ourselves
[1:07:42] put on our spiritual jackets whatever we
[1:07:44] have to do but pay close attention to
[1:07:46] this next statement
[1:07:47] to me it hinges all on this
[1:07:49] compassion and love is the will of God
[1:07:51] and you can only exercise that as God
[1:07:55] gives it
[1:07:57] not human
[1:07:58] emotional passion non-emotional love but
[1:08:01] Divine love which can only be rendered
[1:08:04] and given by God
[1:08:07] this is not listen friends I hope that
[1:08:10] you never walk away from the series
[1:08:12] we've been preaching thinking I have to
[1:08:13] try harder it's trying harder is not
[1:08:15] going to do this we have to become more
[1:08:18] desperate more dependent more sincere
[1:08:20] and say God if without you I will fail
[1:08:22] in perfect love without your spirit
[1:08:25] taking control of me amen you've got to
[1:08:27] highlight the areas in me that I have to
[1:08:29] die to you have to expose the hindrances
[1:08:32] the roadblocks whatever's plugging up
[1:08:34] your channel you've got to show it to me
[1:08:36] amen so that I can surrender that to you
[1:08:39] so that you can flow through me
[1:08:41] because I can't do it and if anything
[1:08:44] that God has been doing in my heart over
[1:08:46] the last couple months amen when I've
[1:08:48] been looking in this subject is
[1:08:49] realizing that this is an impossibility
[1:08:51] it comes down to a hair's breath of
[1:08:54] separation between what is God and what
[1:08:56] is me what is right what is wrong amen
[1:08:58] and it's going to take the word of God
[1:09:00] to come and separate the spirit and the
[1:09:03] soul but it's going to take a revelation
[1:09:05] of that word because I can read
[1:09:06] scriptures all day long and still walk
[1:09:09] away confused Within Myself with which
[1:09:11] is me and which is gone
[1:09:16] may God take the foolishness of
[1:09:18] preaching
[1:09:19] and may God use that
[1:09:22] to root out all the hindrances from our
[1:09:25] life
[1:09:26] may God himself begin to expose and
[1:09:29] begin to show so that we can be what
[1:09:32] he's called us to be in this hour
[1:09:34] so it can this can only exercise as God
[1:09:39] gives this is sovereignly given
[1:09:41] we can talk about we we can talk about
[1:09:44] so many things out of the Bible there's
[1:09:45] more things that we'll begin to talk
[1:09:47] about and we can talk about uh um like
[1:09:52] uh the Rich Young Ruler
[1:09:54] he did so many things we would say okay
[1:09:57] he loves God but Jesus saw something
[1:09:59] else and went for it
[1:10:01] we can talk about you know those who
[1:10:04] love God and they act like it but it
[1:10:06] really they had self-love mixed in and
[1:10:08] it didn't go and you can say how was I
[1:10:11] ever as a human being going to sort all
[1:10:13] of this out
[1:10:14] how am I going to discern when to act
[1:10:16] and when not to act How will I know when
[1:10:18] I should do something and when I
[1:10:19] shouldn't do something I tell you
[1:10:21] Francis getting down to the place where
[1:10:23] he is going to have to have preeminence
[1:10:26] which is the second fold of his
[1:10:28] threefold plan which happens to be the
[1:10:30] fold that is unfolding right now in
[1:10:32] human beings on the Earth where he gets
[1:10:34] preeminence in a body of Believers and
[1:10:36] he's doing that now in the bride
[1:10:39] oh brother Chad am I going to know
[1:10:41] whether God wants me to do this or
[1:10:42] doesn't want me to do this amen I judge
[1:10:45] it by the word but I don't know the
[1:10:46] heart of the person I don't know what
[1:10:48] God's trying to do in their life I don't
[1:10:50] know what the end is I don't know how to
[1:10:52] handle the situation I tell you I never
[1:10:55] know how to handle situations
[1:10:57] if it's not clear in the word you don't
[1:11:00] know what to do amen this is where God
[1:11:02] is going to have to have preeminence in
[1:11:04] the body
[1:11:06] that is the hour that we live in amen
[1:11:08] and we've got to keep surrendering to
[1:11:10] him and quit acting like we know
[1:11:12] everything we don't know anything
[1:11:15] we quit acting like we know how to
[1:11:17] handle situations we know how to deal
[1:11:18] with this and I can deal with that and I
[1:11:20] can deal with that and I can judge that
[1:11:21] no listen God knew amen G God has
[1:11:25] revealed to Jesus Christ by the father
[1:11:27] he knew not to go to Lazarus but hey
[1:11:29] maybe you should go to Lazarus when you
[1:11:31] first heal he's sick maybe you should
[1:11:32] raise him up maybe you should wait
[1:11:35] how do I know when to raise him up how
[1:11:37] do I know when to wait how do I know
[1:11:38] when to pray how would I know not to
[1:11:40] pray
[1:11:45] this is real
[1:11:47] this is the reality
[1:11:50] brother I'm going to say a few other
[1:11:52] statements he's going to bring this more
[1:11:53] real
[1:11:56] and the message the God of this evil age
[1:11:59] said his notice the tree that Satan
[1:12:01] caused Eve to partake of was the tree of
[1:12:02] Good and Evil it was a mixed tree now
[1:12:05] look at the day we're living in when
[1:12:07] he's calling out a bride he's got a
[1:12:09] church that claims to be doing good
[1:12:12] this is Satan's church you've got a
[1:12:13] church that claims to be doing good when
[1:12:16] it's evil
[1:12:17] by denying the word
[1:12:21] claims to be doing good
[1:12:24] saving people ministering to the Lost
[1:12:27] helping the needy
[1:12:30] but brother bear says when it's evil by
[1:12:34] denying the word
[1:12:36] not that though the works are horrible
[1:12:38] not that it's bad to do those nice
[1:12:41] things that is fine there's nothing
[1:12:42] wrong with that
[1:12:44] but when you deny the word and don't
[1:12:46] bring the word to the people amen and
[1:12:48] tell them that they're fine amen so far
[1:12:50] but hold back the word amen that has
[1:12:53] become now evil
[1:12:55] all the good works
[1:12:58] have accomplished nothing but evil
[1:13:01] because of denying the word
[1:13:06] amen we spoke about this last time in
[1:13:09] second Thessalonians chapter three oh no
[1:13:12] we didn't I'm just going to read this
[1:13:13] quickly to you but it goes into the
[1:13:14] context of church discipline and in this
[1:13:17] scripture Paul says if there if any man
[1:13:20] obey not our word by this epistle note
[1:13:22] that man and have no company with him
[1:13:24] that he may be ashamed yet him count him
[1:13:27] not as an enemy but admonish him as a
[1:13:29] brother
[1:13:30] Paul's telling them
[1:13:32] listen if somebody
[1:13:35] will not obey our word by this epistle
[1:13:39] note that man and have no company with
[1:13:41] them
[1:13:43] now that does not look like human love
[1:13:46] does it does that look like a loving
[1:13:48] Church
[1:13:53] I mean in the Modern laodicean Standard
[1:13:55] of loving Church
[1:13:58] to not have Fellowship not keep company
[1:14:01] why Paul says if they don't obey my word
[1:14:04] of this epistle my word
[1:14:07] Mark that one
[1:14:09] and keep no company
[1:14:12] with that man that he may be ashamed
[1:14:15] yet count him not as an enemy
[1:14:18] but admonish him as a brother
[1:14:20] this isn't retribution this isn't
[1:14:22] bitterness this is a hatred this is an
[1:14:24] act of love
[1:14:26] this is not my enemy this is my brother
[1:14:30] but he needs to come in obedience to the
[1:14:33] word and my covering for him making
[1:14:36] excuses for him will never help him
[1:14:39] it will only hurt him
[1:14:42] that's not love
[1:14:44] we we spoke
[1:14:47] about church discipline
[1:14:50] and brother Brandon makes this statement
[1:14:52] that's what's the matter with the
[1:14:53] churches today when a man comes into the
[1:14:55] body of Christ and becomes one of the
[1:14:57] members and starts doing evil instead of
[1:14:59] you all getting together and doing this
[1:15:01] very same thing and you Branham
[1:15:02] Tabernacle do that because as long as
[1:15:05] you're holding him up he's under the
[1:15:07] blood and you and he just keeps doing
[1:15:09] the same old thing over and over and
[1:15:11] over all the time you get together turn
[1:15:14] him over to the devil for the
[1:15:15] destruction of the flesh that is Spirit
[1:15:17] like might be saved in the day of the
[1:15:19] Lord
[1:15:20] and watch the whip of God come in watch
[1:15:22] The Devil take hold of him that's an
[1:15:24] evil spirit gets him and this boy here
[1:15:27] straightened out he come back we find
[1:15:29] out in second Corinthians where he
[1:15:31] really cleaned up before God he goes
[1:15:33] right into the discipline that Paul
[1:15:35] teaches and into the reconciliation
[1:15:37] because the purpose of discipline was
[1:15:38] reconciliation the purpose of discipline
[1:15:40] was love and salvation
[1:15:44] but but he says if you cover for them
[1:15:47] you keep him here under the blood and
[1:15:50] the two things are happening he's
[1:15:51] contaminating the church and he's also
[1:15:53] going on thinking he's all right when
[1:15:55] he's not all right
[1:15:59] that's not love
[1:16:02] so it's difficult
[1:16:04] I tell you sometimes we meet difficult
[1:16:06] situations
[1:16:08] these things are taxing I I'll say this
[1:16:11] they're taxing on the human emotional
[1:16:13] Realm
[1:16:15] you you I've had to I've had to deal in
[1:16:19] these situations
[1:16:20] as a pastor and and I tell you I never
[1:16:24] understood what it meant until I'm in
[1:16:26] this position
[1:16:27] I never knew what it meant to have a
[1:16:29] Watchman at the gate and a Watchman on
[1:16:31] the wall and I never knew what that
[1:16:32] meant
[1:16:34] but I tell you when you when you talk to
[1:16:36] people that you love that you genuinely
[1:16:38] love that you like and you want to
[1:16:40] fellowship with but you know there's an
[1:16:42] unreconciled situation
[1:16:46] and and they want to come I've got
[1:16:48] people who want to come want to be part
[1:16:49] of the assembly love the word love the
[1:16:52] ministry they want to come amen but
[1:16:54] they're under church discipline
[1:16:55] somewhere else
[1:16:57] and I said you can't come here
[1:17:00] you can't sit Among Us you can't partake
[1:17:02] with us amen because there's an
[1:17:05] unreconciled situation that has to be
[1:17:07] settled before you come here we can't
[1:17:09] take you in and cover for you amen if
[1:17:12] the sin is not taken care of if it's
[1:17:13] taken care of go and reconciled and then
[1:17:16] come back
[1:17:19] but that sounds easy to do but when you
[1:17:21] get down to it amen it tears your heart
[1:17:24] out it twists you in the knot you second
[1:17:26] guess yourself you wonder is this right
[1:17:28] is this loving am I doing the right
[1:17:30] thing and you have to make very very
[1:17:32] hard decisions and make very difficult
[1:17:35] conversations amen but you're compelled
[1:17:37] by the love of God because you know that
[1:17:40] only the word of God will work in the
[1:17:42] end nothing else will work no matter how
[1:17:44] I feel about this situation I feel like
[1:17:47] I don't want to have this conversation I
[1:17:49] feel like I don't want to tell you no I
[1:17:51] love you and I want you to come but
[1:17:53] regardless of how I feel about the
[1:17:55] situation it will never work out to your
[1:17:58] benefit until we stay with the word
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:04] and that is love but in a human realm it
[1:18:07] doesn't look like love
[1:18:11] it looks how can you turn somebody away
[1:18:13] how can you they they want to have
[1:18:15] Fellowship they want to be amongst the
[1:18:17] brother they want to do that how can you
[1:18:20] what else can we do
[1:18:22] and display the love of Christ
[1:18:24] how else can we show love
[1:18:28] tell your friends it's not easy
[1:18:31] these things are
[1:18:33] not easy
[1:18:37] I mean we can just if I can just open my
[1:18:41] heart
[1:18:43] it's so easy you can preach things like
[1:18:46] this
[1:18:47] and a way to work people in a frenzy we
[1:18:49] won't allow any sin in here we'll cut it
[1:18:51] out and you're not coming here
[1:18:52] everybody's amen hallelujah but when it
[1:18:54] gets down on the human level
[1:18:57] and you're looking somebody in the eye
[1:18:58] and you love them
[1:19:00] and you have to tell them that's wrong
[1:19:03] brother by the word sister that's wrong
[1:19:05] that can't be permitted that can't be
[1:19:07] allowed it won't do you good it won't do
[1:19:09] the people good
[1:19:12] listen you you can work people into a
[1:19:14] frenzy and we can get all excited about
[1:19:16] we won't let sin in the doors and we
[1:19:18] want this and we'll stand with the word
[1:19:21] but when it comes down to the human
[1:19:23] element
[1:19:24] something in you is going to have to die
[1:19:27] stay with the word
[1:19:30] something within you is going to have to
[1:19:33] surrender
[1:19:34] to love God and to really love your
[1:19:37] brother
[1:19:39] the love of God is not easy
[1:19:43] it's rugged it's tough
[1:19:45] it's true in every circumstance
[1:19:48] and human love has to die
[1:19:50] so that the love of God
[1:19:52] can live
[1:19:58] it's amazing how some things are easy to
[1:20:00] read
[1:20:01] hard to live
[1:20:04] easy to say hard to do
[1:20:06] and the reality is not in the saying the
[1:20:08] reality is in the doing
[1:20:10] the reality is not in the preaching or
[1:20:12] even the saying the amen to the
[1:20:13] preaching the reality is when it becomes
[1:20:15] manifest
[1:20:16] and flesh
[1:20:18] and we become tested
[1:20:20] from those things
[1:20:24] and the message who is this Brother Bear
[1:20:26] preaches and what if somebody sinned
[1:20:28] maybe they do something they ought not
[1:20:30] to have done maybe they ought to have
[1:20:32] done something they did not do or
[1:20:34] something on that manner and here they
[1:20:36] are God permitting Satan to hold that
[1:20:38] curse on them
[1:20:40] to bring them to something to obedience
[1:20:42] sicknesses sometimes is a whip God is
[1:20:45] using to bring obedience
[1:20:46] and what if that person standing there
[1:20:48] says oh Hallelujah glory to God praise
[1:20:51] God anoint them with oil pray over them
[1:20:53] and happen to cast that evil spirit off
[1:20:55] of them and God permitted it to be put
[1:20:57] on there
[1:20:59] I'm in trouble right then with God
[1:21:02] so what brother Brown says if God
[1:21:05] permitted that spirit because somebody's
[1:21:07] off the word they're disobedient in some
[1:21:09] way and God is trying to bring them
[1:21:10] because of his love back into obedience
[1:21:12] and permit an evil spirit to afflict
[1:21:15] them maybe sickness or something common
[1:21:16] brother but I'm talking about he takes
[1:21:18] it up and if I was able to take that off
[1:21:20] and God permitted it I would be in
[1:21:22] trouble with God
[1:21:25] that's why I said when it when it gets
[1:21:27] down to this level you can say how in
[1:21:30] the world am I as a human being going to
[1:21:32] do this amen it's going to take
[1:21:34] something Beyond me I need God every day
[1:21:37] of my life I need the spirit of God I've
[1:21:40] got to stay surrendered this is why a
[1:21:42] half-hearted Christian life is not going
[1:21:44] to get it it's going to take a total
[1:21:46] sold out complete surrender daily walk
[1:21:48] with the Lord because I can't just do
[1:21:50] Sunday and Wednesday and ever come into
[1:21:52] the image of Christ
[1:21:54] it's not going to happen this is far
[1:21:56] beyond that amen this is God coming down
[1:21:59] and building and building and building
[1:22:00] and US emptying and him growing within
[1:22:03] us
[1:22:05] praise God
[1:22:06] let's go to Matthew chapter 16 now
[1:22:23] Matthew chapter 16.
[1:22:26] verse 21.
[1:22:30] from that time forth began Jesus to show
[1:22:32] unto his disciples how that he must go
[1:22:34] into Jerusalem and suffer many things of
[1:22:36] the elders and chief priests and scribes
[1:22:39] and be killed and be raised again the
[1:22:41] third day
[1:22:42] then Peter took him and began to rebuke
[1:22:44] him saying be it far from the Lord this
[1:22:47] shall not be unto thee but he turned and
[1:22:50] said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan
[1:22:52] Thou Art and offense unto me for thou
[1:22:54] savorest not the things that be of God
[1:22:57] but those things that be of men
[1:23:00] you have to ask yourself what what made
[1:23:03] Peter rebuke the Lord
[1:23:06] we know Peter loved the Lord because
[1:23:08] after the resurrection Jesus comes to
[1:23:10] Peter and three times he asks him does
[1:23:12] thou love his name Peter and Peter says
[1:23:14] yes Lord I love you
[1:23:16] Peter loved the Lord he had affection
[1:23:18] for him and Peter did not want this
[1:23:20] thing to happen to Jesus and when Jesus
[1:23:22] starts speaking the truth the word of
[1:23:25] God the plan of God Amen the great love
[1:23:28] of God that was going to be expressed in
[1:23:30] crucifixion amen he begins to express
[1:23:32] that there's going to go to Jerusalem
[1:23:34] going to suffer many things of the
[1:23:37] elders and chief priests and scribes and
[1:23:38] be killed and be raised again on the
[1:23:40] third day all Peter could think was no
[1:23:43] my Lord this isn't going to happen to
[1:23:44] you no way can we let this happen
[1:23:49] and Jesus turns around and says get thee
[1:23:51] behind me Satan and brother man says he
[1:23:53] wasn't speaking to Peter
[1:23:55] but Peter was being influenced by an
[1:23:57] evil spirit and Peter's words were
[1:24:00] expressing an evil to desire
[1:24:03] and what was that evil desire the evil
[1:24:05] desire was to stop the manifestation of
[1:24:08] the word of God
[1:24:09] and to stop the love of God from being
[1:24:11] expressed why because Peter didn't want
[1:24:14] that to happen
[1:24:17] man
[1:24:19] and was Peter wrong for loving Jesus was
[1:24:22] Peter long for having affection for him
[1:24:24] was Peter wrong for wanting him to stay
[1:24:25] no he wasn't wrong but where he was
[1:24:28] wrong is when he denied the words that
[1:24:29] were coming out of his mouth and had
[1:24:31] another plan and tried to stop the word
[1:24:33] of God from coming forth
[1:24:38] and
[1:24:39] we know that Jesus was delivered by the
[1:24:43] determinate Council and foreknowledge of
[1:24:46] God this was God's plan from the
[1:24:48] beginning and Peter is now contradicting
[1:24:51] the word
[1:24:53] because he's influenced by an evil
[1:24:55] spirit because of his human love
[1:25:01] say God help us
[1:25:03] now we find Peter
[1:25:06] although he was rebuked and although the
[1:25:08] devil was rebuked Peter never really
[1:25:10] changes his mind
[1:25:13] if we go over to John chapter 18.
[1:25:16] we'll see that he stays in the same
[1:25:19] frame of mind
[1:25:26] John chapter 18.
[1:25:30] verse 10.
[1:25:35] then Simon Peter having a sword drew it
[1:25:38] and smote the high priest servant and
[1:25:39] cut off his right ear
[1:25:41] and the servant's name was malcus
[1:25:44] then said Jesus unto Peter put up thy
[1:25:46] sword into the sheath the cup which my
[1:25:48] father hath given me shall I not drink
[1:25:50] it
[1:25:52] Peter
[1:25:54] listen Peter is there what was Marcus
[1:25:57] doing what was what was uh he coming he
[1:26:01] was coming with a band a guard to come
[1:26:03] and arrest Jesus and Peter didn't want
[1:26:06] Jesus to be arrested and Peter wanted to
[1:26:09] defend Jesus and Peter took out a sword
[1:26:12] and the love that Peter had for Jesus he
[1:26:15] was willing to kill a man
[1:26:18] because that's what he was attempting to
[1:26:19] do and I've heard somebody say before
[1:26:21] and it struck me as absolutely true I
[1:26:23] don't think he was trying to cut off his
[1:26:25] ear
[1:26:26] I think he was trying to split his skull
[1:26:28] cut off his head he was trying to kill
[1:26:30] the man what was motivating him to kill
[1:26:33] love what kind of love wrong love
[1:26:36] because the love of God was surrendering
[1:26:39] to the will of God Amen and Jesus had
[1:26:42] the love of God surrendering to the will
[1:26:44] of God Amen to allow the word of God to
[1:26:47] come into manifestation that was pure
[1:26:49] love to hinder that
[1:26:51] was wrong
[1:26:54] and now Peter's wrong and and he was so
[1:26:57] brave one minute but then when the
[1:26:58] question comes to him by a damsel he
[1:27:00] becomes so terrified showing that human
[1:27:02] love is so insufficient to carry out the
[1:27:05] word of God because human love still
[1:27:07] holds self as the center of affection
[1:27:11] it was Peter who didn't want his Lord
[1:27:15] to die Peter listen Peter didn't want
[1:27:19] anything to change
[1:27:21] Peter didn't want Jesus he wanted the
[1:27:23] ministry to continue on his position
[1:27:24] with Jesus to continue his friendship Is
[1:27:26] Love Peter wanted it to stay amen so
[1:27:29] Peter loved Peter
[1:27:32] and then when Peter got to the to the
[1:27:35] outer Court there warming him by a fire
[1:27:36] in the damsel begin to ask him you're
[1:27:38] not one of them Peter still loved Peter
[1:27:42] because he denied the Lord the very one
[1:27:45] he loved so much he would kill a man for
[1:27:47] now he's denying that very one showing
[1:27:49] you how weak human love is
[1:27:54] that's why I can't be relied upon it
[1:27:56] must be surrendered
[1:27:58] human love is only good if it lies with
[1:28:00] the word of God any other way we get rid
[1:28:03] of it
[1:28:05] and so we see now
[1:28:08] if
[1:28:10] if I could take another step
[1:28:15] because of this human love that Peter
[1:28:19] has for the ministry for the Lord for
[1:28:22] the work that's going on first church
[1:28:25] and let's say first church and first
[1:28:26] pastor
[1:28:27] can I say that
[1:28:30] because of that when somebody comes to
[1:28:33] disrupt that he's willing to take a
[1:28:35] sword and kill that man
[1:28:38] to protect what he loves
[1:28:44] brother Brandon said this in Hebrews
[1:28:46] chapter 7 part 2 be careful you're
[1:28:50] guilty if you speak a word against your
[1:28:52] brother
[1:28:53] that's not right not just go around and
[1:28:56] tear tear down
[1:28:57] you don't have to stick a knife in a
[1:28:59] man's back to kill him
[1:29:01] you can break his character and kill him
[1:29:04] kill his influence speak against your
[1:29:07] pastor say something bad about him you
[1:29:09] just might as well shot him told
[1:29:11] something that wasn't right about him
[1:29:12] well it's it'll kill his influence with
[1:29:14] the people and things like that and
[1:29:16] you're guilty of it
[1:29:19] there's more than one way to kill a man
[1:29:21] we may not do like Peter did and run out
[1:29:23] with a sword amen but he says if you
[1:29:26] killed his influence you speak something
[1:29:27] against him amen you might as well put a
[1:29:30] knife in his back
[1:29:34] and how many times in you who have been
[1:29:37] around a while have seen how many times
[1:29:39] because of the love for my church
[1:29:44] love or we could say like this my love
[1:29:47] for the message
[1:29:52] when somebody comes against it I'm
[1:29:53] willing to kill that man
[1:29:56] well I no you you gave him a piece of
[1:29:59] your mind
[1:30:01] you told him he was all this that and
[1:30:03] the other and
[1:30:04] told everybody else what he was too
[1:30:11] amen
[1:30:14] what was Marcus there doing fulfilling
[1:30:16] the word of God
[1:30:19] now it's not the part I would want to
[1:30:20] fulfill
[1:30:22] I wouldn't want Marcus's part but Marcus
[1:30:24] was there fulfilling the word of God he
[1:30:26] was there by the determinate Council and
[1:30:29] foreknowledge of God he was there to
[1:30:31] arrest Jesus to bring him further on in
[1:30:33] the revelation of the word
[1:30:36] and Jesus never railed against them
[1:30:39] never but but occupations against him
[1:30:42] Jesus surrendered
[1:30:46] and so it was such an example for us
[1:30:49] amen my love listen my love
[1:30:53] for God cannot produce evil actions
[1:31:00] if my actions are evil my love was human
[1:31:05] but I thought it was Godly love who
[1:31:08] thought it was my love of God and it was
[1:31:10] a love for God but it was still a
[1:31:12] self-centered love for God
[1:31:15] because when somebody attacked the
[1:31:17] message they offended me and in the
[1:31:19] offense to me I lashed out at them that
[1:31:22] wasn't defending the message that was
[1:31:24] defending yourself
[1:31:26] that was the result of human love
[1:31:30] and and as I look at this listen I have
[1:31:34] prayed and I have confessed and I have
[1:31:36] asked God to forgive me because I am
[1:31:37] guilty of this
[1:31:39] I'm guilty of this I'm guilty of the
[1:31:42] wrong love bringing the wrong motivation
[1:31:43] and taking the wrong action I'm guilty
[1:31:45] of lashing out I'm guilty of saying
[1:31:47] things I should I have remorse in my
[1:31:50] heart because I have done this very
[1:31:51] thing
[1:31:53] this isn't this isn't a just a a concept
[1:31:56] this is reality and I've lived the
[1:31:58] reality on the wrong side
[1:32:01] not realizing you know when brother
[1:32:03] Branham when he was speaking to Lee Veo
[1:32:05] and levale says how do you let people
[1:32:06] talk against you so how can you let this
[1:32:08] man say this and that and brother bear
[1:32:10] said maybe the Lord let him say that
[1:32:14] he said remember what David when David
[1:32:17] was going out a cast out a king a
[1:32:20] rejected King his son was taking the
[1:32:21] throne and he was leaving Jerusalem and
[1:32:23] that man was spitting on him and the son
[1:32:25] in his in his one of his captains of his
[1:32:27] guard said I'll let the head stay on
[1:32:29] that dog to Spitz on my king and David
[1:32:31] said leave him alone the Lord told him
[1:32:33] to do that brother Ben was having this
[1:32:35] discussion amen with Lee Veil and as he
[1:32:38] discusses this with levale in the Blue
[1:32:40] Boar Restaurant amen they go home and
[1:32:42] when he goes home and his wife's picking
[1:32:44] up a conversation they had before about
[1:32:46] whether they should go back to Arizona
[1:32:48] or stay in in Jeffersonville and she
[1:32:51] goes I know God called you out there but
[1:32:53] does he want us to stay out there and
[1:32:54] there was this question
[1:32:55] and then somebody made a statement oh
[1:32:58] this tax man and this that and said
[1:33:00] something bad about the tax man who's
[1:33:02] having the tax case against brother
[1:33:03] Brandon and brother bear said without me
[1:33:05] even thinking about what I said to leave
[1:33:07] he said I said maybe the Lord told him
[1:33:10] to do that
[1:33:11] said as soon as I did letters flashed on
[1:33:14] the wall said come on back to Arizona
[1:33:18] you think God wasn't pleased with the
[1:33:19] Son of God passing that test
[1:33:22] he didn't rail back he recognized if God
[1:33:25] allows somebody to persecute you Me
[1:33:27] Maybe I need to be persecuted
[1:33:31] if God permits it if somebody's
[1:33:34] lambasting my name if somebody's
[1:33:36] speaking false accusations Against Me
[1:33:38] Maybe that's what I need
[1:33:41] because all things work together for
[1:33:43] good to them who are the called
[1:33:45] according to his purpose so even the
[1:33:48] negative things will work together for
[1:33:49] good God will God will use this listen
[1:33:52] when when when Paul the apostles was was
[1:33:55] walking amen through the Greek
[1:33:58] Countryside and he was in a city and
[1:34:00] there was this witch following after him
[1:34:02] and she was crying out amen these men of
[1:34:05] God these men of God Amen it was
[1:34:07] troubling his Spirit every day
[1:34:11] but he couldn't say anything to her
[1:34:13] until God gave him permission and at
[1:34:15] some point God gave permission and he
[1:34:17] rebuked the spirit in her and it went
[1:34:18] out
[1:34:20] and and brother Branham said that he God
[1:34:23] didn't give him permission because he
[1:34:25] needed the advertisement
[1:34:32] maybe you need the advertisement
[1:34:36] maybe your name needs to become a
[1:34:37] household name in a negative way because
[1:34:39] you need the advertisement
[1:34:41] so that God can turn it for good
[1:34:49] I'm telling you the hardest one to
[1:34:51] discern itself
[1:34:53] I look back now and looking back
[1:34:57] retrospectively I can see that wasn't
[1:34:59] God
[1:35:01] that was Chad Lamb
[1:35:06] it wasn't God that was me
[1:35:08] I it wasn't the anger of God in Me
[1:35:15] and I have to be honest
[1:35:17] I wasn't defending his word
[1:35:19] I was defending
[1:35:21] myself
[1:35:27] I don't think we're ever going to go up
[1:35:28] till we get honest
[1:35:30] can't grow up
[1:35:33] until there's true humility and we
[1:35:34] recognize
[1:35:36] so many things that we thought were
[1:35:38] Godly we're just human
[1:35:41] so many things we thought were right
[1:35:43] we're motivated by the wrong thing
[1:35:45] the love of God is so much higher than
[1:35:48] human love it's so different than human
[1:35:49] love amen that we have to surrender our
[1:35:52] own feelings and own emotions and lay
[1:35:54] them down amen and also the love of God
[1:35:57] is not quick the love of God is Not uh
[1:36:01] irrational the love of God
[1:36:03] the love of God is steady
[1:36:06] stable
[1:36:07] it's been determined before the
[1:36:09] foundation of the world it's not
[1:36:11] reacting all the time
[1:36:13] that instant reaction and movement
[1:36:16] that's human love
[1:36:18] but the love of God has been placed over
[1:36:21] time and is a constant steadfast
[1:36:23] unmovable Force
[1:36:26] doesn't have to react to criticism and
[1:36:29] doesn't have to react falsely it doesn't
[1:36:31] it doesn't get bothered it doesn't get
[1:36:33] flustered
[1:36:35] it doesn't get its feathers ruffled
[1:36:38] it already knows the end from the
[1:36:40] beginning I want to move into the love
[1:36:41] of God
[1:36:43] with all of my heart
[1:36:45] so love when we start looking at this
[1:36:49] way love is very deceptive
[1:36:54] I hope I can say that
[1:36:56] and know that I'm speaking of human love
[1:36:59] not God's love not Agape but love is
[1:37:02] very deceptive
[1:37:03] because it feels so much like I love God
[1:37:07] and it feels so much like I'm defending
[1:37:09] God and it feels so much like I I'm
[1:37:12] doing this for righteous reasons Amen in
[1:37:14] that love masks the actual Pride that's
[1:37:17] in my heart
[1:37:18] that's causing me to lash out
[1:37:22] so love is very deceptive
[1:37:25] amen but the word of God is a discerner
[1:37:29] are the thoughts and intents of the
[1:37:30] heart
[1:37:31] when we begin to see these things we
[1:37:33] begin to recognize
[1:37:35] that in the past there's been many
[1:37:37] attempts to defend a church
[1:37:41] to defend a Ministry to defend a
[1:37:45] Doctrine
[1:37:46] and in those attempts many individuals
[1:37:49] have taken swords I happen to be one of
[1:37:50] them have taken swords
[1:37:53] and wasn't trying to cut off someone's
[1:37:55] ear I'll tell you
[1:37:57] was trying to kill that thing that was
[1:38:00] coming against what I felt like I loved
[1:38:07] I recognize now
[1:38:08] that's not what God has called me to
[1:38:12] not here God doesn't need me to defend
[1:38:15] him
[1:38:18] and God doesn't need me to defend the
[1:38:20] message my goodness the message is
[1:38:22] what's defending me
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:26] that God doesn't need my sword
[1:38:30] that's why I looked at Peter and said
[1:38:31] Peter put your sword in the sheath
[1:38:35] this cup that my father has given me
[1:38:36] shall I not drink it this is the will of
[1:38:39] God
[1:38:41] man we don't need to go
[1:38:43] to battle
[1:38:46] just to defend our own offenses
[1:38:49] just to defend what we love
[1:38:52] we must just stay true to the word and
[1:38:55] let God anoint us when to speak and when
[1:38:58] to be quiet not let our emotions anoint
[1:39:01] us
[1:39:03] I have so many things that I said In the
[1:39:05] Heat of the Moment
[1:39:06] that I regret for the rest of my life
[1:39:11] I want to be motivated by not motion I
[1:39:14] want to be motivated by the spirit of
[1:39:16] God
[1:39:18] I want to look at this one more thing
[1:39:20] here before we
[1:39:22] part today
[1:39:23] and I want to look at the story of
[1:39:25] Florence shakarian
[1:39:26] you know Florence shakarian was a sister
[1:39:28] to demon Shakira and Demas was a good
[1:39:30] friend brother Bram was friends with the
[1:39:31] entire family
[1:39:33] and Florence passed away in 1965 and
[1:39:36] brother Branham predicted that she was
[1:39:38] going to pass away
[1:39:39] and in this quote he tells the story out
[1:39:43] of God's power to transform from
[1:39:45] September 11 1965.
[1:39:47] so good morning friends he said this of
[1:39:50] the shakarian family brother Williams
[1:39:51] and Sister Williams and many of them
[1:39:52] here know about it I saw that in a
[1:39:55] vision about two or three years before
[1:39:57] she got sick and it happened
[1:39:59] and last year when we were here I
[1:40:01] believe it was in January at the
[1:40:02] convention it was the time that the
[1:40:04] priest what's his name I forgot his name
[1:40:06] was here Stanley Stanley Bishop Stanley
[1:40:09] from the Catholic Church you remember
[1:40:11] when he brought me the Bible you know
[1:40:12] and he said to me
[1:40:15] it was several prophesying my daughter
[1:40:18] you are healed
[1:40:19] so sometime before when brother Brandon
[1:40:22] was was preaching birth pains and he has
[1:40:26] this new Bible and the pages are stuck
[1:40:27] together and we know that whole how that
[1:40:29] all the story transpired and that
[1:40:31] Catholic bishop comes and brings him his
[1:40:33] Bible said read it out of my book say
[1:40:35] steady son the Lord is fixing to do
[1:40:36] something and he preached his birthday
[1:40:38] he opens the scripture and later he
[1:40:40] finds out two pages were stuck together
[1:40:41] and he comes back and preaches this day
[1:40:44] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:40:46] it was at that time but during that
[1:40:49] service Florence shakarian had got up
[1:40:51] and she had sung a sung a song special
[1:40:53] and it was beautiful apparently she was
[1:40:55] a wonderful singer and people began to
[1:40:58] prophesy because they knew that she was
[1:40:59] sick and she had a a bad sickness a
[1:41:02] terminal sickness I believe it was and
[1:41:04] they began to prophesy and they begin to
[1:41:07] say my daughter you're healed they were
[1:41:10] saying daughter of God you'll not die
[1:41:11] but you'll sing again there was
[1:41:13] prophecies going forth in that
[1:41:15] and I believe it's Billy Paul tells more
[1:41:17] of this in his testimony how he got out
[1:41:19] later and he was bothered by that
[1:41:20] because he knew his dad said he saw a
[1:41:22] vision of her passing away
[1:41:24] but here they are she sings a special
[1:41:26] the anointing Falls of tongues and
[1:41:28] interpretations of Prophecy that
[1:41:30] daughter you'll not die but you'll live
[1:41:33] and Billy Paul was troubled about it and
[1:41:35] and later his dad could tell he was
[1:41:36] troubled he said what's troubling you
[1:41:38] son
[1:41:39] and he said uh well that they were
[1:41:41] prophesying in there he said what about
[1:41:43] it they were saying that she'll not die
[1:41:45] she'll live he said yes
[1:41:48] he said but you said
[1:41:50] he said brother Billy I don't know or he
[1:41:52] said Billy I don't know
[1:41:54] he said all I know is God told me she's
[1:41:56] going to go
[1:41:57] and she's gonna go
[1:42:03] and here it is in September
[1:42:07] 65 and they're talking about the passing
[1:42:09] of Florence shakarian
[1:42:12] and what about all those prophecies that
[1:42:15] were anointed
[1:42:17] during the service
[1:42:19] she sang and it felt so good
[1:42:23] I believe they loved Florence
[1:42:26] I wonder what motivated the prophecy
[1:42:30] because it wasn't a true prophecy
[1:42:35] but it must have felt good
[1:42:38] it must have felt right
[1:42:41] it must have seemed right to say that
[1:42:47] you see how dangerous human love is
[1:42:55] he said it was several prophesying my
[1:42:58] daughter
[1:42:58] you're healed
[1:43:00] and he knew that the vision had said
[1:43:02] he's talking again about Bishop Stanley
[1:43:04] he knew the division had said that she
[1:43:06] would not get well she would die between
[1:43:08] two and three o'clock in the morning
[1:43:10] remember that so two or three o'clock
[1:43:12] and I I couldn't tell Demas and yet I
[1:43:14] told her stepmother right over in the
[1:43:16] room right across the place here I said
[1:43:18] she isn't going to get well and Mr Karen
[1:43:21] said well everybody is prophesying I
[1:43:24] said course listen to brother Brandon I
[1:43:26] love this character
[1:43:28] I said course I could be wrong myself
[1:43:30] but I said she isn't going to get well
[1:43:33] he knew what the vision said he was just
[1:43:35] being gentle with his stepmother
[1:43:39] said I told many of them about three
[1:43:41] years ago I saw her running for her life
[1:43:43] and she went into a bed and she raised
[1:43:44] up her hands and screamed to me like
[1:43:46] that and I couldn't even reach her and
[1:43:48] then I seen her die and I looked and
[1:43:49] there was something there was a clock
[1:43:51] and it said it's between two and three
[1:43:53] o'clock and so the bishop said well I'll
[1:43:55] just watch and see how that comes to
[1:43:57] pass
[1:43:57] so it did come to pass we are certainly
[1:44:00] sorry I feel the church has lost a great
[1:44:02] person and sister Florence shakarian but
[1:44:04] she was a great singer she was a
[1:44:06] Spirit-filled woman
[1:44:10] you want to talk about confusion
[1:44:16] brother Branham season of vision a
[1:44:18] prophet of God sees and a vision
[1:44:20] that she's not going to live she's going
[1:44:22] to die between two and three
[1:44:26] but in the emotion of Florence sick as
[1:44:29] she was standing up and singing such a
[1:44:31] beautiful special it must have been
[1:44:33] moving I'm just guessing
[1:44:36] but it must have been moving so much so
[1:44:38] that people with gifts begin to operate
[1:44:41] and begin to prophesy and prophesy and
[1:44:45] her stepmother said everyone's
[1:44:47] prophesying it was more than one
[1:44:49] prophecy there was a collaboration let's
[1:44:51] say or a confirmation
[1:44:56] and it's amazing that in the atmosphere
[1:44:59] with the love towards Florence in the uh
[1:45:03] emotional whatever it was of seeing her
[1:45:06] sing and knowing she was sick and
[1:45:07] everybody praying amen there were people
[1:45:09] who began to prophesy you'll not die
[1:45:11] daughter but you'll live and begin to
[1:45:13] prophesy and the family was hearing the
[1:45:15] prophecy it was troubling brother Billy
[1:45:17] but that prophecy was false it did not
[1:45:21] come from the spirit of God
[1:45:28] this is why this is why I'm saying I'm
[1:45:31] telling you with all my heart I know if
[1:45:33] God does not help us we will not be
[1:45:35] helped
[1:45:36] if God does not save us we will not be
[1:45:38] saved if God by his Spirit does not
[1:45:41] control us amen we will destroy
[1:45:43] ourselves
[1:45:45] oh God we need God we need God more than
[1:45:49] anything else in this life we need him
[1:45:51] more than breath more than food more
[1:45:52] than housing we need the spirit of God
[1:45:54] to lead us we need to empty out so that
[1:45:57] we can fill out more we need more cut
[1:45:59] out of us we don't need more of self we
[1:46:01] need less of self self is destructive
[1:46:06] but we need the love of God should have
[1:46:08] brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:46:12] what false hope
[1:46:15] to a family
[1:46:18] and I I wasn't there but I can only
[1:46:21] imagine because I've been in
[1:46:23] services
[1:46:25] I can only imagine the tears The Joy the
[1:46:28] rejoicing
[1:46:33] all because of human emotion
[1:46:39] God help us
[1:46:42] we can't do this on our own this is only
[1:46:45] God LED
[1:46:49] but I thank God
[1:46:51] that God had a plan before the
[1:46:52] foundation of the world and that plan
[1:46:55] had a threefold purpose
[1:46:57] and the second fold of that three-fold
[1:46:58] purpose was for him to get preeminence
[1:47:01] and a body of Believers and preeminence
[1:47:04] means full control and I'm so glad that
[1:47:07] is his purpose before the foundation of
[1:47:10] the world because my purpose isn't
[1:47:12] enough and my desire isn't enough it
[1:47:14] must be his purpose
[1:47:16] and he will accomplish his purpose
[1:47:20] I see God
[1:47:22] take more of me
[1:47:25] take more of me
[1:47:27] help me
[1:47:29] to die a greater death to self
[1:47:38] I
[1:47:39] am the problem
[1:47:45] but he is the solution
[1:47:51] when the word came back in this day
[1:47:54] the full measure of the Holy Ghost came
[1:47:56] back
[1:47:58] and the more I received the word I
[1:48:00] received the life of the word and the
[1:48:03] more I empty out and the more I open up
[1:48:04] and the more I receive and acknowledge
[1:48:06] that's the truth that's the truth that's
[1:48:08] the truth I I'm receiving the word that
[1:48:12] changes me from Glory unto Glory
[1:48:16] and I said God
[1:48:18] keep changing me
[1:48:22] brother Branham
[1:48:24] he has another story I'd like to just go
[1:48:26] in this another story and then we'll
[1:48:27] close
[1:48:29] he's got a a young lady who brings him a
[1:48:32] dream and is after him for the
[1:48:34] interpretation of the dream
[1:48:36] and the message influence he says now a
[1:48:38] little girl came to me the other day she
[1:48:40] may be sitting present now said brother
[1:48:42] Benham I gave you a dream
[1:48:44] and in this dream I had a certain thing
[1:48:46] I want you to tell me
[1:48:48] I sat down now if there is any out
[1:48:52] in here outside of Pentecostal Realms
[1:48:54] let me excuse myself to you a moment
[1:48:56] and he said you he said you never
[1:49:00] and she said you never told me my dream
[1:49:03] she he never gave her the interpretation
[1:49:05] so she went to Brother bam knowing he's
[1:49:06] a prophet gave her a dream and she now
[1:49:08] wants the interpretation of her dream
[1:49:11] I said honey sit down just a minute
[1:49:13] and I said your father and mother are
[1:49:15] very good friends of mine retired
[1:49:17] farmers who come from a long ways to
[1:49:18] sojourn with us
[1:49:20] and I said they believed me as a servant
[1:49:21] of Christ you're just a child about 12
[1:49:24] years old I think she goes to school
[1:49:25] with my Becky
[1:49:27] and I said look you're going to meet a
[1:49:30] lot of things out here honey in the name
[1:49:31] of Christianity I said when you find a
[1:49:34] man that's got every interpretation just
[1:49:36] like this he snaps his fingers
[1:49:38] just like that in the name of the Lord I
[1:49:40] said you be careful about that that's
[1:49:42] contrary to the scripture
[1:49:44] Jesus said there was many lepers in the
[1:49:46] Days of Elijah but only one was sent to
[1:49:48] him one many widows in the days of
[1:49:51] Elisha but only one was sent to him many
[1:49:53] things that Jesus did not do many times
[1:49:56] those gimmicks that's got every answer
[1:49:57] be careful
[1:49:59] when somebody stands up and speaks in
[1:50:01] the name of the Lord that must be true
[1:50:02] it must be exactly the truth
[1:50:05] you might in your mind be impressed
[1:50:09] I said now honey I believe I could tell
[1:50:12] you what I think your dream is
[1:50:15] but to tell you in the name of the Lord
[1:50:17] no sir
[1:50:18] brother Branham even felt like he might
[1:50:21] he he might know what that means
[1:50:24] but he wasn't going to tell her
[1:50:26] look what I just
[1:50:28] just follow along with me
[1:50:31] and I'll read that again now honey I
[1:50:33] believe I could tell you what you what I
[1:50:36] think your dream is but to tell you in
[1:50:38] the name of the Lord no sir
[1:50:40] because she she knows the things I said
[1:50:43] I have ever spoke to you in the name of
[1:50:45] the Lord but what had happened I said
[1:50:46] thousands has come and said this that I
[1:50:49] said I cannot tell you what your dream
[1:50:50] is till I see it over again and then he
[1:50:53] tells me then I can say the Lord told me
[1:50:55] until then I don't know I don't want to
[1:50:59] take my influence and my opinion I can't
[1:51:02] say thus saith the Lord because that's
[1:51:03] me thinking it that's best to my opinion
[1:51:07] we must be sincere because we've got the
[1:51:10] greatest thing in the world the greatest
[1:51:12] Treasure of Heaven is Christ Among Us
[1:51:14] why do we want to substitute some little
[1:51:17] influence to try to make ourselves
[1:51:20] somebody big among somebody here why not
[1:51:23] be a humble servant to Christ
[1:51:28] you know what I think
[1:51:30] I think he loved her enough not to tell
[1:51:31] her what he thought about her dream
[1:51:38] sometimes I've been frightened
[1:51:40] at things people will say as if they
[1:51:43] know somebody will share a dream oh that
[1:51:45] means that how do you know that means
[1:51:47] that
[1:51:49] and what if the influence you have as a
[1:51:52] brother or sister when somebody starts
[1:51:54] to tell you say oh no that's that and
[1:51:55] that's that remember brother Benham said
[1:51:57] white this and you know white horse is
[1:51:58] this and that and so we can tell by that
[1:52:01] this means this my goodness what if you
[1:52:04] and they trust you and they believe that
[1:52:06] you have spiritual insight and they take
[1:52:07] what you said and they go with it
[1:52:12] and why would you do that anyways if you
[1:52:14] didn't know for sure if you didn't have
[1:52:15] thus Faith the Lord if you didn't see
[1:52:16] the dream and you didn't know for sure
[1:52:18] why would you do that because you want
[1:52:20] to look spiritual
[1:52:22] and you want to have the answer
[1:52:24] and you want to know something
[1:52:30] a greater love will say listen brother
[1:52:33] sister I don't really know
[1:52:36] I don't know God hasn't given me that
[1:52:39] gift if God wants me to interpret he'll
[1:52:41] have to show it to me I'll see the dream
[1:52:42] he'll tell me until then I can't I can't
[1:52:46] tell you I don't know we'll just pray
[1:52:48] that God will bring it to pass or God
[1:52:50] will reveal it some way but I don't know
[1:52:54] see to me that's real Godly love
[1:52:57] that's genuine love not playing games
[1:53:00] with people spiritually
[1:53:05] do we understand
[1:53:08] real love they say you know what I don't
[1:53:11] have that gift I can't tell you I don't
[1:53:13] know God hasn't shown me I don't want to
[1:53:16] lead you wrong
[1:53:17] I don't want to act like I know what
[1:53:19] your solution to your problem is I don't
[1:53:21] want to act like I know if you do x y z
[1:53:23] it'll be all right I don't know if you
[1:53:25] do x y z it'll be okay
[1:53:27] all I can do is point you to the word
[1:53:30] that's all I can do all I can do as a
[1:53:32] brother is tell you I I don't really I
[1:53:35] can't tell you what you should do I
[1:53:36] can't tell you you should do this or do
[1:53:38] that but this is what I see in the Bible
[1:53:40] and I see the scripture and I'll give
[1:53:41] you the scripture and it looks to me
[1:53:43] like this fit but go pray about it and
[1:53:45] see how God leads you
[1:53:50] you know it looks like we're loving I'll
[1:53:52] I'll tell them and I'll help them and
[1:53:54] that's if listen if that's coming from
[1:53:57] your own understanding and your own
[1:53:59] opinion and your own thoughts and you
[1:54:01] begin to share it as if it's from the
[1:54:03] Lord that's not love
[1:54:07] but I want to help that's not helpful
[1:54:11] what's helpful is to be honest to be
[1:54:14] truthful and say I really don't know but
[1:54:15] I will pray with you that God will give
[1:54:18] you an answer to your question
[1:54:20] or God will show you out of the word or
[1:54:22] God will bring it over the pulpit or
[1:54:24] Sunday or God will have somebody hit you
[1:54:26] with an answer and it'll come from the
[1:54:27] word and you'll hear a tape or or you'll
[1:54:29] be in a service or you'll read your
[1:54:30] Bible and God will give you the answer
[1:54:32] I'm praying that you get your answer but
[1:54:34] I'm not the source of your answer he's
[1:54:36] the source of your answer
[1:54:41] the same reason people are motivated to
[1:54:43] do those things is the same reason Peter
[1:54:45] wanted to cut Marcus's head off
[1:54:49] self
[1:54:52] and oh I want to die to self
[1:54:56] I want to die to self
[1:54:58] I I haven't arrived yet to the place
[1:55:01] that I want to be but I want to be more
[1:55:03] surrendered than I am now
[1:55:05] I want to be more consecrated than I am
[1:55:07] now I want to I want more of the love of
[1:55:09] God I I want less of me I don't want me
[1:55:13] I want him living in me
[1:55:16] I don't want to be muddled up with false
[1:55:19] love and human love and and mixing it up
[1:55:22] with the love of God I just want the
[1:55:24] love of God to take control
[1:55:27] I want it to be Earnest I wanted to be
[1:55:29] sincere I want it to be real I want it
[1:55:31] to be genuine in every way I want it to
[1:55:33] be him and not me and I want him to get
[1:55:35] all the credit and me to get none
[1:55:38] because if I do something that allows me
[1:55:41] to share in the credit then I will
[1:55:43] inject self again and I will destroy the
[1:55:45] very thing that I'm hoping he will
[1:55:46] accomplish in me
[1:55:48] so there's anything that I can inject so
[1:55:50] that I can get partial credit that's the
[1:55:52] part that will ruin the whole thing
[1:55:53] that'll be the hair in the biscuit
[1:55:55] the part that I can get credit for
[1:55:59] but more than anything I want him to
[1:56:02] take his preeminence
[1:56:04] I want him to express his love I don't
[1:56:07] want my love to move an error I don't
[1:56:10] want my love to become evil because I'm
[1:56:12] standing against the will or word of God
[1:56:14] because of my emotions about a situation
[1:56:18] I want to take a step back and say God I
[1:56:20] don't know
[1:56:21] what you want done but I believe your
[1:56:24] word says
[1:56:26] and I would like to see this word made
[1:56:29] manifest
[1:56:32] amen
[1:56:35] sometimes love is not praying
[1:56:39] that someone will be healed
[1:56:41] but praying that they'll be restored and
[1:56:44] then healed
[1:56:48] there's sometimes when I I have insight
[1:56:52] and I know the situation
[1:56:54] and somebody asked a prayer request and
[1:56:56] I cannot pray what they're asking me to
[1:56:59] pray
[1:56:59] because my heart won't allow me
[1:57:03] but what I can pray is God I pray you
[1:57:06] turn the light on
[1:57:08] so they can see the air so that they can
[1:57:10] repent and can be completely delivered
[1:57:12] of this affliction
[1:57:14] what I want to pray is not what's easier
[1:57:16] convenient what I want what I need to
[1:57:18] pray is what's really loving
[1:57:20] what's genuine love
[1:57:23] amen if we go and fix everybody's
[1:57:26] problems when God wants them to have
[1:57:27] problems
[1:57:30] when God's using the problems to bring
[1:57:33] about circumstances so there's a
[1:57:34] repentance and a restoration and
[1:57:37] sometimes what he wants us to do is
[1:57:39] leave things alone and let him finish
[1:57:40] his work
[1:57:42] How will I know when and how will I not
[1:57:44] I can't give you the answer all I know
[1:57:46] is let's get dependent on him and say
[1:57:48] God by your spirit you must move me
[1:57:50] according to your word I it must be by
[1:57:52] Perfect faith not by me
[1:57:56] amen
[1:57:58] I'd like to just finish
[1:58:01] by reading
[1:58:04] First Corinthians 13.
[1:58:06] if we could just read this together
[1:58:18] First Corinthians 13.
[1:58:21] verse 1.
[1:58:27] though I speak with the tongue of men
[1:58:29] and angels
[1:58:31] and have not charity
[1:58:32] I become a sounding brass or tinkling
[1:58:35] symbol
[1:58:36] this charity is what we've been talking
[1:58:37] about for the last four services this
[1:58:39] love true love genuine love agape love
[1:58:42] the love of God
[1:58:44] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[1:58:47] and understand all Mysteries and all
[1:58:48] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:58:51] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:58:52] not love
[1:58:54] I am nothing
[1:58:57] that verse
[1:58:59] weighs heavy on me more so than it did a
[1:59:03] month ago
[1:59:05] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:59:07] the poor and though I give my body to be
[1:59:09] burned and have not charity it profited
[1:59:13] me nothing
[1:59:14] charity suffereth long these are the
[1:59:16] attributes of Charity charity suffereth
[1:59:19] long in his kind
[1:59:21] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[1:59:24] itself
[1:59:25] it is not puffed up
[1:59:28] amen so charity is not jealous of
[1:59:31] anybody else
[1:59:33] does not envy anybody else's gift
[1:59:35] anybody else's position in the church
[1:59:37] anybody else's family any gift or reward
[1:59:39] that God has given to anybody charity
[1:59:42] does not is not jealous of that
[1:59:45] because charity knows that's God and
[1:59:48] what God's given me is God's love for me
[1:59:50] and what's God's given them is God's
[1:59:51] love for them
[1:59:55] charity font is not itself
[1:59:57] doesn't put itself on a pedestal doesn't
[2:00:00] lift itself up doesn't promote itself
[2:00:03] it's not puffed up it's not proud
[2:00:06] does not behave itself unseemly
[2:00:09] seeketh not her own
[2:00:12] so that means she's not looking for her
[2:00:14] own welfare this is not human love this
[2:00:16] is pure love not seeking for herself but
[2:00:19] for others
[2:00:21] amen is not easily provoked
[2:00:24] thinketh no evil
[2:00:27] Rejoice is not an iniquity but rejoices
[2:00:30] in the truth
[2:00:32] beareth all things believeth all things
[2:00:35] hope with all things endureth all things
[2:00:40] charity never faileth
[2:00:44] what is the peak of the stature of a
[2:00:47] perfect man what is the Capstone what is
[2:00:49] the headship of Christ uniting with the
[2:00:50] bride it is this perfect love
[2:00:53] and I thank God we live in the
[2:00:56] generation for this manifestation
[2:00:59] am I where I want to be no
[2:01:02] and where I used to be no
[2:01:04] thank God
[2:01:06] but I believe that God has more for us
[2:01:09] to manifest
[2:01:11] I believe that great manifestations will
[2:01:14] all be by the love of God
[2:01:17] though I can speak with tongue of men
[2:01:19] and angels and have not loved I become
[2:01:21] as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[2:01:23] though I I have all Faith to move
[2:01:26] mountains listen that is pretty
[2:01:31] move a mountain
[2:01:32] by that Faith but I'm not charity I've
[2:01:34] become nothing but I know all Mysteries
[2:01:36] and I have no knowledge and have not
[2:01:39] this love it profit me nothing
[2:01:42] what do I need above everything I need
[2:01:44] the love of God should have brought in
[2:01:46] My Heart by the Holy Ghost
[2:01:48] I needed to grow until it takes full
[2:01:50] control of my being
[2:01:53] amen let's all stand
[2:01:55] musicians if you'll come and Blake if
[2:01:56] you'll come
[2:02:01] and
[2:02:03] you know brothers and sisters I love you
[2:02:06] with all my heart
[2:02:08] you know and I
[2:02:09] I never
[2:02:11] intend to preach to be heavy I never
[2:02:13] intended this to be heavy
[2:02:15] I thought it would be fun to preach
[2:02:18] but when I got to preaching and I
[2:02:20] realized how heavy
[2:02:22] this is
[2:02:23] how it affects every one of us how it
[2:02:26] calls us to a greater surrender
[2:02:29] to a greater death
[2:02:31] and how impossible listen that
[2:02:34] at the end of the sermon I feel the same
[2:02:36] way you do how impossible this will be
[2:02:38] without God
[2:02:40] if God hadn't determined that I would
[2:02:42] move into the stature of a perfect man
[2:02:44] before the foundation of the world good
[2:02:46] luck
[2:02:48] what chance do I have but I believe with
[2:02:51] all my heart he determined me to that
[2:02:54] destination that he knew who what
[2:02:57] attributes of his would would arrive in
[2:02:59] the end time and he knew what it would
[2:03:01] take to get them to that position and so
[2:03:03] when he had to move people to a higher
[2:03:06] plane he released more of his word
[2:03:08] so what was it that brought him higher a
[2:03:10] release of his word so at the end time
[2:03:12] when we had to come to the very image to
[2:03:14] be so much like him she will be in his
[2:03:17] very image amen he had to release the
[2:03:19] full measure of his word
[2:03:21] and the full measure of his word is to
[2:03:24] bring us into the full manifestation of
[2:03:26] Christ
[2:03:27] I believe it's for now and I believe
[2:03:29] it's for me
[2:03:30] if I didn't I would just go put my head
[2:03:33] in the hole cry I'd lay under a juniper
[2:03:35] tree and say God let me die now for I'm
[2:03:37] no better than my fathers
[2:03:39] but though I'd be not better than my
[2:03:41] father's I have been the destiny
[2:03:43] predestined and ordained to do something
[2:03:45] different than my father's
[2:03:48] I have been ordained to come into the
[2:03:50] image of Jesus Christ and I believe you
[2:03:53] will
[2:03:54] and if he has to bring a word that tears
[2:03:57] to hide off of me then so be it if
[2:03:59] that's what it takes
[2:04:01] if he has to do deep heart surgery in me
[2:04:03] and slice out slivers it's deep inside
[2:04:06] of me that I didn't know were there then
[2:04:08] thank God for that because I could have
[2:04:09] never done it myself
[2:04:11] if it takes him exposing The Hiding
[2:04:14] Place the devil's hiding places in my
[2:04:16] heart then thank God he shined the light
[2:04:18] on that so that I can surrender it to
[2:04:20] him
[2:04:21] because if not I'm walking around
[2:04:22] holding on to it thinking that
[2:04:24] everything's fine but God will expose it
[2:04:26] and all of a sudden I can get angry and
[2:04:28] upset I can feel hopeless or I can say
[2:04:30] thank you God now I know there's another
[2:04:32] area you're wanting to work on in me
[2:04:37] I don't believe God intends to expose it
[2:04:39] unless he unless he intends to deal with
[2:04:42] it
[2:04:43] and heal it and correct it
[2:04:46] God is not the god listen he didn't
[2:04:49] expose Luther's error of smoking and
[2:04:52] drinking and swearing and hating the
[2:04:54] Jews
[2:04:55] he only exposed the air of Catholicism
[2:04:58] so he could move into that
[2:05:00] because the age wasn't ready for more
[2:05:03] so I believe when God is ready to deal
[2:05:04] with something he exposes it and he
[2:05:07] doesn't expose it prematurely he exposes
[2:05:09] it in the time he intends to deal with
[2:05:12] it
[2:05:14] so I want to walk away with a heart full
[2:05:16] of joy knowing that this is what God's
[2:05:18] calling to me in this day then God must
[2:05:20] provide the means to Manifest this
[2:05:23] manifestation because he knows I can't
[2:05:26] do it he knows I don't have it in my
[2:05:28] Human Side he goes I can't so if God is
[2:05:30] calling for this at this hour and he's
[2:05:32] exposing this in me now then he has a
[2:05:35] solution already on the scene
[2:05:39] and that solution is the full measure of
[2:05:42] his life that was opened up when the
[2:05:44] seals opened
[2:05:46] and that is for us I believe with all my
[2:05:49] heart and I'm going to walk out of here
[2:05:50] rejoicing because I know that this is
[2:05:53] what he's going to do in me if I can lay
[2:05:55] myself in his hand
[2:05:58] and let the master heart surgeon
[2:06:00] do the heart surgery
[2:06:02] I'm going to come out just fine
[2:06:05] let's bow our heads and pray
[2:06:08] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[2:06:10] for your goodness to us
[2:06:12] Lord your truth is not always easy
[2:06:16] Lord it doesn't always feel good
[2:06:20] but it's always good
[2:06:23] and Lord your chastisement
[2:06:25] it's not always Pleasant
[2:06:28] at the moment
[2:06:30] but it brings forth the Peaceable fruits
[2:06:32] of righteousness
[2:06:35] God I pray you'd help us to surrender to
[2:06:37] you in a greater way
[2:06:39] may we give up Lord our own thinking our
[2:06:43] own thoughts are
[2:06:44] maybe surrender our emotions or what we
[2:06:47] feel
[2:06:48] may we lay it all aside Lord
[2:06:51] may we make room for you to come
[2:06:54] take a greater
[2:06:55] a greater Abode in the side of us
[2:06:59] take whatever room we empty out whatever
[2:07:01] we surrender may you take and occupy
[2:07:04] that space in US
[2:07:06] move out of us Lord every barrier
[2:07:09] every hindrance
[2:07:11] to this manifestation of Your Love
[2:07:14] may you go on bring us into a higher
[2:07:17] plane
[2:07:18] where we can go beyond the human
[2:07:20] beyond the natural
[2:07:23] and this love can become Supernatural
[2:07:26] a regular part of our life
[2:07:29] supernaturally day by day
[2:07:32] thinking different
[2:07:34] acting different
[2:07:36] responding different
[2:07:38] or may we recognize that it's you and us
[2:07:41] may we give you that Liberty that you're
[2:07:44] looking for in this hour may we yield to
[2:07:47] you ourselves that you might take the
[2:07:48] preeminence you've ordained for this
[2:07:50] time
[2:07:51] take us Lord
[2:07:53] use this for your glory we pray
[2:07:55] bless your people Lord as we go from
[2:07:57] here may we go with the satisfaction of
[2:08:00] knowing Lord that you who begun a good
[2:08:03] work in US
[2:08:04] shall not cease
[2:08:06] until your day is accomplished
[2:08:09] we love you father we commit ourselves
[2:08:11] to you
[2:08:12] and ask that you have your way
[2:08:14] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
