[4:55] we read a verse of scripture and let you
[4:57] be seated
[5:03] galatians chapter four we want to go to
[5:05] verse one
[5:11] he said now i say that the heir
[5:14] as long as he is a child
[5:18] differs nothing from a servant
[5:21] though he be lord of all but it's on the
[5:24] tutors and governors
[5:26] until the time appointed of the father
[5:29] let's just pray dear lord we just thank
[5:32] you for your grace and mercy
[5:33] and we just ask that you we just come
[5:35] and speak to our hearts
[5:36] we just commit ourselves to you lord in
[5:38] the name of jesus christ we pray
[5:41] amen we may be seated
[5:45] i was um
[5:48] that's a little hooks there he goes i
[5:51] was uh
[5:54] i wanted to just minister on a few
[5:56] things tonight the lord
[5:57] help us how many of you love the lord
[6:02] you know god is doing so many wonderful
[6:04] things now
[6:06] and it could seem to be negative
[6:09] you're seeing a lot of negative things
[6:11] happening
[6:12] but yet god is doing wonderful things
[6:14] [Music]
[6:16] and uh i thank god for this message
[6:20] yeah i'm so thankful that uh i didn't
[6:24] have no denominational life all i ever
[6:26] known
[6:27] is the message and uh
[6:30] my wife i was just reading some things
[6:33] on the internet
[6:34] some of the reason why people left the
[6:36] message
[6:37] you know they can't shake me i just said
[6:39] well let me just read some of this stuff
[6:42] and uh when i began to read my wife what
[6:44] you doing i said i'm just
[6:45] reading some of this stuff my people say
[6:47] they left the word
[6:49] you know we say message but really when
[6:51] it comes to the end of the day they left
[6:52] christ
[6:53] [Applause]
[6:55] because christ is the message
[6:56] [Music]
[6:56] [Applause]
[6:58] so when i began to read it she said what
[7:00] you're reading that for i said just
[7:01] reading it over some things
[7:04] my wife said that she burley so i want
[7:06] to tell you something right now
[7:09] she said you get caught up into that
[7:10] mess so i just want you to know
[7:13] i'm gonna move back down to my ot i am
[7:16] not going to follow you
[7:18] she said i just want you to know that
[7:20] she said i'm not going to be like some
[7:21] of these other sisters follow their
[7:22] husband when they leave his word
[7:24] she says i'm not doing it she doesn't
[7:25] want you to know that
[7:27] and i said god bless you sister
[7:31] i think she got a revelation can we say
[7:34] praise the lord
[7:36] you know i didn't get mad i didn't be
[7:39] like
[7:39] i'm your head i'm your husband you're
[7:41] supposed to follow me i'm the you know
[7:42] you're my wife supposed to be submit
[7:44] you know that wouldn't even work it
[7:47] wouldn't
[7:48] she got a mind and a heart made up she
[7:50] said i just want you to know that
[7:52] i'm out god bless you that's the way it
[7:56] ought to be
[7:58] you know there's nothing
[8:03] i was talking to your pastor all the
[8:06] stuff that's going on
[8:07] it makes no difference what people can
[8:10] try to prove or say they can prove
[8:12] that's their business but
[8:16] if somebody can even show me something
[8:17] where brother brown has changed
[8:18] something i didn't say something right
[8:20] then lined up right
[8:22] that's fine because it's not going to
[8:24] change
[8:25] my opinion about him because brother
[8:28] brown was a man
[8:31] let me say man and it makes no
[8:34] difference
[8:34] they can try to prove or try to show you
[8:37] can't shake me
[8:38] you know even by the cloud anything it
[8:41] don't make no difference i'm not going
[8:42] to debate with nobody about that
[8:44] because signs and wonders and miracles
[8:47] is not what got me in the message it's
[8:50] the word
[8:52] amen and i have a revelation of the word
[8:56] and uh uh sometimes i i watch
[8:59] uh people want to you know you can't
[9:02] prove a prophet
[9:05] you can't vindicate a prophet god do it
[9:10] can we say amen here is a man speaking
[9:13] something even about
[9:14] our constellation being caught up he's
[9:17] speaking about something
[9:18] a year before it even happened
[9:22] if people could just look at the fact
[9:24] something did happen
[9:27] i mean he can't make something happen in
[9:29] the sky
[9:30] no man can do that they want to try to
[9:33] break it down i said but he spoken way
[9:35] over
[9:36] here and there it is so something
[9:38] happened
[9:40] we might can't explain it all but
[9:42] something happened
[9:45] see i don't get caught up into those
[9:47] things myself
[9:49] because you know it's just like uh back
[9:52] where i'm from in south carolina
[9:54] we got all kinds of different things
[9:56] going on they got
[9:57] this teaching called the hebrew
[9:59] israelites and
[10:00] it's most of us around black people
[10:03] about the hebrew
[10:04] israelite they're trying to prove who
[10:05] all this you know
[10:07] god was talking to me one time about the
[10:09] hebrew israelite and this this and
[10:11] that's a brother
[10:12] i some so thankful paul said that we
[10:14] shouldn't get caught up into all these
[10:16] genealogies
[10:18] it's just gender strife and i said this
[10:20] is what paul was talking about right
[10:21] here
[10:22] i said you know what i don't care i said
[10:24] there's nowhere where jesus
[10:26] there's nowhere god you can find in
[10:28] scripture where he wants us to know what
[10:30] he looks like
[10:32] that's he wants us to know who he is
[10:35] so it just kind of kept his little
[10:37] thoughts and then
[10:39] he start telling me well you know this
[10:41] man before jesus and just this
[10:42] for jesus and i'm just listening to and
[10:45] i just can't ask you a question
[10:46] as this man is you talking about that uh
[10:49] don't know all this before jesus i said
[10:51] is he your redeemer he said
[10:54] no i said is he your savior he said no
[10:57] i said come on man i said i want to talk
[10:59] about somebody that can do something for
[11:01] me
[11:03] i need redemption i needed salvation i
[11:05] said i don't i'm not going to get into
[11:07] all of this
[11:08] but you know all of these things are
[11:09] actually distractions
[11:12] and it makes you dig it makes you get
[11:14] into the word yourself
[11:16] so you'll be able to answer for yourself
[11:18] like timothy said you know
[11:20] and timothy started to show that
[11:21] self-approval but you know i can't
[11:23] explain everything
[11:25] but i believe and i just believe by
[11:28] having the right spirit god give me the
[11:30] understanding
[11:30] when i need the understanding that's
[11:33] just what i believe
[11:34] but you know brothers and sisters god is
[11:37] working on
[11:37] all of us molding and shaping us the way
[11:41] that he wants
[11:42] us he got all different types of ways
[11:45] that he do it god be doing something in
[11:47] our lives sometimes we don't catch it
[11:49] until it's over
[11:50] then we can look back and see it we
[11:52] don't see why we going through it
[11:55] so i want to talk about some of those
[11:56] things if the lord
[11:58] jesus christ would help us this evening
[12:01] and
[12:01] i want to talk about adoption but
[12:04] i titled the sermon ingredients for
[12:08] adoption
[12:08] it might sound a little comical but it's
[12:10] not comical
[12:11] it's just something that the way i know
[12:13] how to put it so
[12:15] i can express what's in my heart amen
[12:18] actually it was a friend of mine still
[12:20] is a friend of mine in new zealand
[12:22] made a statement about ingredients for
[12:24] adoption and that
[12:26] word always stuck to my head and and
[12:29] and i preached on this a couple times
[12:31] before but
[12:32] it just kind of come back upon my heart
[12:34] about adoption how many you believe
[12:36] we're in adoption time
[12:38] god is actually positioning every
[12:40] believer in the body of christ
[12:42] but you know god got a certain way he
[12:45] deal with me he might not deal with you
[12:47] in a certain way he would deal with you
[12:49] that he don't deal with me
[12:51] because each and every one of us is
[12:52] different just like having children
[12:54] you can have five children all of them
[12:56] got different characters about them
[12:58] and what you have to do deal with the
[13:00] child according to his character
[13:03] amen so one child might be like why
[13:05] daddy why you didn't talk to me like
[13:06] that why you didn't handle me like they
[13:08] said well cause you're different
[13:09] he's different from you so i deal with
[13:11] you according to where you're at
[13:13] and that's how god do with us he deal
[13:15] with us by our
[13:16] own character can we say amen but
[13:20] i want to just in dealing with adoption
[13:23] when we was reading here in the
[13:24] scripture
[13:25] in galatians uh uh
[13:28] it says that the heir as long as he is a
[13:31] child
[13:32] he differs nothing from a servant though
[13:35] he be
[13:35] lord of all and i really like this
[13:38] scripture because
[13:39] what where paul is laying this out which
[13:41] you know you can't preach on adoption in
[13:43] one night this is
[13:44] a big subject but i like what he was
[13:47] putting it
[13:48] showing that that the error even though
[13:51] everything
[13:51] actually belongs to him but until he
[13:55] come to a place of maturity
[13:57] the father just look at him just as a
[13:59] servant
[14:00] because he can't give him no
[14:01] responsibility until he get to a place
[14:05] not where he think he should be but to
[14:07] the place where the father want him to
[14:09] be
[14:10] because the scripture says that he
[14:11] differed no nothing from a servant
[14:14] though he be lord of all by him being
[14:16] the son he has
[14:17] rights to he's heir to it but he can't
[14:20] have the possession of it
[14:21] until his father determines it to be so
[14:24] so the scripture said but it's under
[14:26] tutors
[14:27] and governors until the time opponent
[14:30] of the father so it makes no different
[14:33] what the son
[14:34] can see what belongs to him that he's
[14:36] going to be a ruler over it one day
[14:38] that's fine but he can't have nothing
[14:41] until the father say
[14:43] now you can have it notice the scripture
[14:46] until the appointed time of the father
[14:49] it ain't when the son say i'm ready now
[14:51] i think i can handle this now give it to
[14:54] me now that ain't got nothing to do with
[14:55] it
[14:55] it's when the father says you're ready
[14:57] now
[14:58] see a lot of times we say lord i'm ready
[15:01] i'm ready i can handle it i can handle
[15:02] it he'll be like no you can't you say
[15:04] lord yes i can say no you can't
[15:06] because god knows he got to take you to
[15:08] another level where he wants you to be
[15:10] before he can give you responsibilities
[15:13] that he wants you to have
[15:14] that's our father can we say man
[15:18] you see brothers and sisters we we don't
[15:20] went past these times through the years
[15:22] even in ministry will administer might
[15:24] feel that he should have a
[15:26] certain recognition or a certain
[15:27] position or certain things he should be
[15:30] able to do should be able to preach
[15:31] that's childish hello
[15:34] you're going to maybe i know that sounds
[15:36] a little blunt but i'm just myself it
[15:38] actually is
[15:39] childish because children is always
[15:41] bickering at one another what they think
[15:43] they deserve
[15:45] that's what children do can we say amen
[15:47] so we have to grow up and not get into
[15:49] those things and go up
[15:50] above that it is what god wants it's his
[15:53] will
[15:54] it's his purpose this is his plan
[15:57] not our plan his plan what he wants to
[16:00] do
[16:00] amen and i believe when we get to those
[16:02] places in life we just surrender
[16:04] ourselves to him
[16:05] and say say lord what would you have
[16:07] your servant to do what do you want me
[16:09] to do
[16:10] i'm here amen but i want to just
[16:13] talk about a few things and uh
[16:17] turn with me to mark chapter 6 as i go
[16:20] here
[16:34] while you turn it to mark chapter 6 i
[16:35] want to read a quote
[16:43] the prophet god said in the message
[16:44] adoption
[16:47] he said you're not converted till you
[16:50] get the holy ghost
[16:52] that's what the scripture says jesus
[16:54] told peter ask anyone read your
[16:56] scriptures
[16:57] he was justified by believing on the
[16:59] lord jesus
[17:00] become a follower an apostle jesus gave
[17:04] him the keys to the kingdom
[17:06] john 17 17 he sanctified them give them
[17:09] power sit in the mouth
[17:10] cast out devils and things sanctified
[17:13] them sanctify them father through thy
[17:15] truth thy word is truth i sanctify
[17:18] myself because of them
[17:21] and brother banner began to say he said
[17:22] that's one of the sweetest words i ever
[17:24] heard
[17:26] father i sanctify myself for their sake
[17:29] he said did you know he had a right to
[17:31] have a home
[17:32] he was a human you know why he had a
[17:36] right to have
[17:37] a wife he was a man he had a right to
[17:40] all these things
[17:42] but he said father i sanctify myself
[17:45] for their sake i sanctify myself
[17:49] so brother branham is talking about some
[17:51] things that jesus had a right to have
[17:54] you know he knew he had a right to have
[17:56] a wife
[17:57] but he knew he was coming to get a bribe
[18:00] because he was a man
[18:01] but he said i sanctify myself for their
[18:03] sake he said i talked to a little
[18:05] preacher yesterday
[18:07] i got to preach for him in a few nights
[18:09] up here on the highway
[18:11] and i asked him about a certain thing he
[18:12] said yes brother branham
[18:14] but most of my people doesn't believe in
[18:16] that i mean uh i didn't get to
[18:19] tag all this quote but i can just kind
[18:21] of finish quoting it it was something
[18:22] about
[18:24] he was talking about a man some people
[18:25] in his church wouldn't believe in
[18:27] certain things
[18:28] and he knew that they didn't believe in
[18:29] it he said but i sanctify myself for
[18:31] them
[18:31] otherwise he laid aside his own life his
[18:34] own things that he would like to say and
[18:36] do to them
[18:37] for their purpose for their growth and
[18:40] then brother bannon began to talk about
[18:41] he said
[18:42] sanctify yourself one for another and
[18:44] then he began to talk about
[18:46] can you sanctify yourself for your
[18:48] neighbor
[18:50] when you begin to say those things
[18:51] sanctify yourself for your neighbor
[18:53] how many you know you remember
[18:54] christianity is living for others
[18:58] that's what christianity is but when he
[19:00] began to talk about those things
[19:02] it began to be a little striking to me
[19:05] how that we need to sanctify
[19:06] ourself for others and then he said it
[19:08] says
[19:10] jesus was training 12 men this is the
[19:12] scripture we're going to go to in a
[19:13] minute
[19:14] he said that through those 12 men he
[19:16] would take the gospel to the world
[19:18] he said for their sake i sanctify myself
[19:22] he said make yourself for your
[19:24] neighbor's sake
[19:26] for somebody else's sake don't use your
[19:29] liberty
[19:29] for a cloak say it all but sanctify
[19:32] yourself
[19:33] he said behave yourself in the
[19:36] neighborhood
[19:37] like a real christian ought to let your
[19:39] communications be
[19:41] if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself
[19:44] for his sake
[19:45] not knowing what you might do that isn't
[19:48] that interesting he talking about
[19:50] adoption
[19:51] but now you're talking about sanctifying
[19:53] yourself
[19:54] for somebody else's sake for your
[19:56] neighbor's sake
[19:57] in the message adoption you see a lot of
[20:00] times when we talk about adoption
[20:02] and i heard it preach through the year
[20:03] oh power we're going to speak this and
[20:05] we're going to do that
[20:06] all of that is firm but when you really
[20:08] look in the book message adoption
[20:10] he spends a lot about character
[20:15] and many don't like to preach about
[20:17] character
[20:18] but character is actually in part he
[20:21] said sanctify yourself
[20:22] for your neighbor like a real christian
[20:26] ought to for you even for your neighbor
[20:29] how many you know somebody's watching
[20:30] you all the time
[20:32] your neighbor is watching you all the
[20:34] time what you do
[20:35] you might not think so but they watching
[20:38] hey man
[20:39] you know what i'll just use this uh for
[20:41] my own self
[20:43] my own well let me just finish this
[20:44] quote he said now place in the sun
[20:47] first thing after the sun was in he
[20:50] became a son
[20:51] but we find out his behavior
[20:55] is what set him to adoption
[20:58] whether he behaved right or not now he's
[21:01] going back now
[21:02] even with behavior that's a big word
[21:05] his behavior amen is what
[21:08] set him to adoption
[21:13] we're going to deal with that just a
[21:14] little bit can we say praise the lord
[21:18] god got all kinds of things he can use
[21:22] to work on us
[21:25] he can even use your neighbor and
[21:28] sometimes
[21:28] your god can allow your neighbor to do
[21:31] something
[21:31] deliberately to you just to see how
[21:34] you're going to respond
[21:36] and sometimes we would treat other
[21:37] people all kind of ways
[21:39] and just oh you're being somebody in the
[21:42] church oh god bless you sister god bless
[21:44] you brother we ought to be able to tell
[21:45] the neighbor the same thing
[21:46] i forgive you god bless you you didn't
[21:48] mean that neighbor but we treat
[21:50] church people a different way and we
[21:52] treat people that's not in the message a
[21:54] different way
[21:55] that is not right actually wrong
[21:59] can we say praise the lord we expect one
[22:02] another to act a certain way
[22:03] but you know when somebody get out of
[22:05] character and then it sometimes
[22:07] shuffles us sometimes but really i want
[22:09] to show you
[22:10] god is actually doing things to work on
[22:13] you
[22:15] this is not right i'm going to tell you
[22:18] out of everything that is going on
[22:20] people leaving the message that's fine
[22:23] but what is your response to it
[22:26] what is your response god is watching
[22:29] that
[22:30] can we say praise the lord all right
[22:32] let's just go on
[22:35] in galatians mark chapter six
[22:38] but tell them you can just you told me
[22:40] take my liberty here go
[22:42] it might be a little long but praise the
[22:45] lord
[22:47] i'm gonna let it out
[22:51] in mark chapter six
[22:55] i want to go to verse 34.
[22:59] so jesus when he come out saw much
[23:02] people
[23:03] and moved was moved with compassion
[23:04] toward them
[23:06] but there was a sheep not having a
[23:08] shepherd and he began to teach them
[23:10] many things and when the day was now far
[23:14] spent
[23:16] his disciples came to him and said this
[23:18] is a desert place
[23:20] and now the time is far past send them
[23:24] away
[23:24] that they may go into the country round
[23:27] about
[23:28] and into the villages and buy themselves
[23:30] bread
[23:31] for they have nothing to eat verse 37
[23:34] he said unto them give you them to eat
[23:38] and they say unto him shall we go and
[23:40] buy a hundred penny worth of bread
[23:43] and give them to eat now i want you to
[23:46] watch the scripture
[23:48] i love the scripture because i had read
[23:51] to you earlier
[23:52] i didn't finish the quote but brother
[23:54] branham said that jesus was training
[23:56] he said jesus was training twelve men
[23:59] that through these twelve men
[24:01] was to take the gospel to the world so
[24:04] i'm going he was referring back to
[24:06] matthew mark chapter 6 what we're
[24:08] reading
[24:09] how jesus actually training them
[24:12] you got to remember something when jesus
[24:14] trained them
[24:15] because he knew that when he leave he
[24:18] had to have
[24:18] the disciples there so that the ministry
[24:21] could continue
[24:23] but in this training here it's
[24:25] interesting to me
[24:26] in in the last couple of years i would
[24:29] say maybe two now
[24:30] i've been going through some things in
[24:32] my own life and it's in in in
[24:35] and it's good in one way in one way i
[24:37] didn't like it
[24:38] and and what it was uh god wasn't giving
[24:41] me sermons
[24:43] until i got to the pulpit sometimes or
[24:46] even 30 minutes before service start i
[24:48] could not find a sermon
[24:50] and i didn't like that at all i would
[24:51] literally be sitting in
[24:53] sunday morning i would be sitting there
[24:55] scratching my head about to cry
[24:57] saying god what i'm gonna do i said this
[25:00] is just i just can't
[25:01] this is just not right but you know one
[25:03] thing i started doing
[25:05] uh uh and all of that stress
[25:09] i got to a place i was just set in my
[25:11] office i'm talking about
[25:12] servant sometimes the song service could
[25:14] be going nothing happening
[25:16] but i'll just be sitting in my office
[25:19] but i always
[25:20] will appeal to one thing i would say
[25:22] lord
[25:23] one thing i know i have a gift that's
[25:26] for sure and i said and i also know
[25:29] those are your children
[25:31] they're out there and they're hungry and
[25:33] you have to feed them
[25:34] and you don't have to give me something
[25:36] for them and all and i would sometimes
[25:38] say you don't have to do nothing for me
[25:40] i said but those are your children you
[25:42] need to do something for them
[25:44] and i would just sit there and then
[25:46] sometimes maybe 10 minutes before i go
[25:48] to pull pit
[25:49] he start revealing i start scribbling
[25:51] things down just scribbling it down
[25:53] memory start coming back quote start
[25:55] coming back and
[25:56] and i said that's and it's wonderful
[25:59] services
[25:59] i don't like how it is because i don't
[26:01] like being nervous like that you
[26:03] you like to know what you're going to
[26:04] say but but i learned
[26:07] he knows what he wants to say to the
[26:09] people
[26:10] that's what i learned so i began to
[26:13] realize
[26:14] from this scripture right here jesus
[26:17] telling the disciples
[26:19] in their training he says right here
[26:22] they said
[26:23] send them away that they may go into the
[26:25] country round about and into the
[26:26] villages
[26:27] but verse 37 he answered and said unto
[26:30] them
[26:31] give them to eve now jesus knew they
[26:34] couldn't do that
[26:36] he knew that but he had to get them to
[26:39] see they couldn't do it
[26:41] see that's in the same thing in the
[26:43] ministry when we feel that we got it all
[26:45] laid out
[26:48] we got it all laid out we done perfected
[26:51] it
[26:51] that's us doing it but first thing god
[26:54] wants us to know even in the ministry
[26:56] you can't feed the people but i can
[26:59] feed them if you surrender to me i'll
[27:01] give you something to give to the people
[27:04] are you with me and they said it to him
[27:07] shall we go and buy
[27:09] 200 penny worth of bread give them to
[27:12] eat
[27:12] i just love this scripture they are
[27:14] realizing this is impossible
[27:17] we can't do that and i came to that
[27:19] place in my own life
[27:20] god i ain't got nothing i can't feed
[27:22] these people i can't do it
[27:24] and i'm sure god said that's exactly
[27:26] where i want you to be
[27:28] realizing you can't do it and i'm gonna
[27:30] tell you not just ministry
[27:32] god get us all into a place where you
[27:34] can get you to realize you can't do it
[27:37] brother branham said that when you when
[27:40] when you realize you can't do something
[27:42] you can't do it then god can do it
[27:46] see a lot of times we get so comfortable
[27:48] within ourselves
[27:49] i got this i can handle this no
[27:52] you thinking like that god gonna drop
[27:54] some things on you
[27:55] that let you realize you can't do it
[27:59] i'm a witness of that but i love this
[28:02] scripture
[28:04] jesus says in verse 38
[28:07] he says unto them how many lungs have
[28:10] you have
[28:10] go and see and when they knew they said
[28:13] five
[28:14] and two fishes now jesus actually knew
[28:18] what do you have
[28:18] already right
[28:22] so i look at that scripture when i
[28:25] realize i can't feed the people
[28:27] he let me realize what do you have i
[28:30] said i got a gift
[28:32] that you gave me i do realize that
[28:36] but he says verse 39 he commanded them
[28:40] to make all sit down by companies upon
[28:43] the green grass
[28:44] now jesus is giving letting them do
[28:48] what is possible now he gonna do the
[28:51] impossible
[28:52] but he let them do the possible so even
[28:55] in the ministry
[28:56] we have a something possible what we can
[28:58] do
[28:59] he told them you get them to sit down
[29:02] because he's getting ready to feed them
[29:04] you know that's what pastors and
[29:06] ministers can do
[29:07] when we come out realizing god don't
[29:09] give us something
[29:10] it's possible for brother chad your
[29:13] pastor to get you to sit down
[29:16] what do you think the pastor be doing
[29:18] when he comes out and he greet you
[29:20] start talking to you how was your day
[29:22] god bless you greetings
[29:23] that is getting you to sit down so
[29:26] now the word can come can we say man
[29:29] so it was possible for them to go out
[29:31] and get the people see that coming
[29:33] so you know that's why sometimes you
[29:35] might come to church stressed out and
[29:36] the
[29:37] pastor can feel it and start talking
[29:39] start talking about some
[29:40] testimony that god did what is that
[29:42] doing is calming your spirit
[29:45] so now you can begin to receive ministry
[29:48] let's see what he says here and they sat
[29:51] down and ranked
[29:52] by hundreds and by fifties and when he
[29:55] had taken the five loaves and the two
[29:57] fishes
[29:58] he took up that looked up to heaven
[30:01] blessed
[30:01] and break the laws gave them to his
[30:04] disciples
[30:05] to set before them notice jesus the
[30:07] pattern that he did
[30:09] when he broke the fissures in the law he
[30:11] didn't give it to jesus didn't give it
[30:13] to the people
[30:14] he give it to the disciples then the
[30:17] disciples
[30:18] give it to the people that's the same as
[30:20] a minister he realized i can't do it
[30:23] god said what do you got i got a gift
[30:25] he's all right now i'm gonna give you a
[30:27] message
[30:28] and you're gonna use that gift now i
[30:30] want you to go give it to the people
[30:33] that's training the ministry now watch
[30:36] the scripture here
[30:37] he says let's just start to verse 42.
[30:41] they did all eat and were filled they
[30:44] took up 12 baskets full of the fragments
[30:47] and other fishes and they that did eat
[30:50] of the loaves were about five thousand
[30:52] verse 45 straight where he constrained
[30:55] his disciples
[30:57] to get into the ship and to go to the
[31:00] other side
[31:01] until bethesda now listen what the
[31:03] scripture says
[31:04] while he sent away the people
[31:08] he didn't tell the disciple to send the
[31:10] people away
[31:11] he did it notice after they fed the
[31:15] people
[31:16] he said you go now i'ma send the people
[31:18] away
[31:19] that's the same as any minister after he
[31:21] doesn't preach
[31:22] gave the out that god put in his heart
[31:25] guess what
[31:26] now the holy spirit comes sends the
[31:29] people away
[31:30] your pastor can't go to home with you i
[31:32] can't go home with you
[31:33] but christ want to come himself and take
[31:36] what's being preached
[31:37] take that home with you and he start
[31:40] ministering to you
[31:41] by the holy spirit that's what god wants
[31:43] to do so we take up our fragments if i
[31:46] don't finish this service tonight i'll
[31:47] take it up and take it somewhere else
[31:48] and finish it
[31:50] but the holy spirit where he gonna speak
[31:52] to you tonight
[31:53] he will deal with you
[31:56] i didn't come to deal with you god wants
[31:59] to deal with
[32:00] you it's just a gift that he used
[32:03] to bless his people can we say praise
[32:07] the lord
[32:07] so whenever we want to put ourselves in
[32:09] a little category my little ministry my
[32:12] my no it don't work that way inside of
[32:15] god
[32:15] it's what god has permitted us to do the
[32:18] same thing is with our children the
[32:20] prophet god said
[32:21] god gave god let us borrow our children
[32:24] but they belong to god you are god's
[32:27] people
[32:28] that we've been honored to just minister
[32:30] to you are the bride of jesus christ
[32:33] can we say praise the lord all right
[32:35] let's keep going here
[32:41] ingredients for adoption
[32:46] behavior is what set him to adoption
[32:50] you know when things are happening
[32:55] i i myself don't sometimes just consider
[32:58] everything that's happening
[32:59] i start watching attitudes i start
[33:03] watching responses how people responding
[33:05] about what is happening that's what i
[33:07] really focus on a lot myself
[33:09] because i'ma tell you god is shaking
[33:11] everything anything that can be shook
[33:13] will be shaken but i want to show you
[33:16] how god is tuned in
[33:18] on each one of us as an individual
[33:23] and i pray that god would help me now
[33:25] i'm going to use something
[33:27] in in in in i'm not trying to be
[33:29] humorous even if i say something
[33:30] humorous
[33:31] that's what i'm not trying to be because
[33:33] you know i i want to this is serious
[33:37] are you with me but i want to use
[33:39] something to try to
[33:40] get across what i'm trying to say
[33:42] brother you pick that picture up for me
[33:48] oh okay can anybody tell me what that is
[33:53] you ain't got to be a rocket scientist
[33:55] what's that
[33:57] red velvet red velvet cake
[34:03] let's talk about that for a moment
[34:10] but what was that before it come a cake
[34:18] ingredients
[34:20] take the picture down brother i won't
[34:21] keep looking at it i just want you to
[34:24] see it
[34:24] you take it down there i'm going to use
[34:27] my wife
[34:29] to try to express what's in my heart
[34:34] let me let me just put this in too you
[34:37] know
[34:38] god bless you for chad you know a lot of
[34:40] times uh
[34:41] i kind of vanished a little bit it's i
[34:45] don't know let me tell y'all something
[34:46] about complexes let me just
[34:48] drop this in right here
[34:51] complexes is a terrible thing
[34:55] and a lot of people have them they know
[34:58] they have them
[34:59] but they do everything they can to
[35:00] convince themselves they don't have them
[35:05] oh yeah it's a terrible thing complexes
[35:08] could control you
[35:11] you know for a little while i used to
[35:14] get little messages come back to me
[35:15] people like where's burley williams
[35:18] and i said tell them i'm still in the
[35:20] message i'm just home
[35:23] so i'm fine i'm good but something
[35:25] happened to me
[35:27] i got i got criticized pretty bad and i
[35:30] started listening to the criticism
[35:34] and i did people start calling me a
[35:36] legalist
[35:37] oh you too hard you too rough and stuff
[35:40] like that
[35:40] that's ah but i pretending like it
[35:42] wasn't bothering me
[35:44] but i kept listening to it and then
[35:47] i started getting things back uh peter
[35:50] people were pretty much calling me
[35:51] shallow he said you're not deep in the
[35:54] word
[35:54] and things like that i ain't gonna worry
[35:57] about it but you know what i listened to
[35:59] it too much
[36:01] it didn't start bothering me a complex
[36:04] came
[36:05] and i got to a place i don't have to go
[36:07] preach nowhere
[36:08] i have a church i can stay right here i
[36:11] can preach
[36:12] i'm good i'm fine ain't nothing wrong
[36:14] with me
[36:15] that's what i'm saying but all along i
[36:18] was lying to myself
[36:21] complexes keep you out of fellowship
[36:24] because it's something you're dealing
[36:25] with within yourself
[36:27] but you know what happened i began to
[36:31] i was preaching at a place i'm still on
[36:32] my subject
[36:35] i was preaching at a place on the first
[36:37] and a guy come out to me
[36:38] after the service i had two services he
[36:41] said
[36:43] that was okay he's some kind of used to
[36:45] so and so preaching and so and so
[36:46] preaching and so and so preaching
[36:48] i said oh yeah yeah he pretty much is
[36:52] telling me you you you
[36:54] your way down here i went back to the
[36:57] pastor's house no i stayed at the church
[36:59] in between services
[37:01] that's all right i came back to the
[37:05] second service
[37:06] and man i preached i think i preached on
[37:08] the feast days
[37:09] it's just it was just revelation i mean
[37:12] i laid it out and laid it out people was
[37:14] happy
[37:16] and then when the service was over he
[37:17] came to me that's
[37:19] it but you know what i failed
[37:25] i literally preached to one man
[37:28] in the church because of what he said to
[37:31] me
[37:32] and i failed
[37:36] because of the complex but what helped
[37:39] me to get over it
[37:40] i come to realization it's not what
[37:43] people say about you
[37:45] is how you respond to what they say
[37:47] about you
[37:49] when you know who you are can't nobody
[37:52] shake you
[37:53] so i begin to look into my heart i know
[37:55] who i
[37:56] am i know why i preach i know what my
[37:59] reason
[37:59] i know what my motive i know what my
[38:02] objective is
[38:03] i said it makes no difference what
[38:05] people say about me
[38:08] but i tried to convince myself hey they
[38:10] know me i'm good
[38:11] i'm good i'm good no i wasn't oh no
[38:15] i let it pull me down and i let it
[38:17] direct my decisions
[38:19] that's what complexes can do but
[38:22] god permitted me to go through that to
[38:25] help my growth
[38:27] but until i come to reality i couldn't
[38:29] move no farther than that
[38:32] and the reality is i don't worry about
[38:35] what people think about me
[38:36] i'm concerned about what he thinks about
[38:38] me
[38:40] and that's what helps me to move
[38:43] can we say praise the lord you see
[38:45] that's a lot of problems with young
[38:47] children
[38:47] don't know how to handle complexes
[38:50] because growing up as a child
[38:52] running to other children children you
[38:54] know children are brutal
[38:56] little children can say something to
[38:58] another one they're just brutal
[39:00] but what is actually doing is breaking
[39:02] making scars
[39:04] and if that child it can't handle it
[39:06] properly
[39:07] it's going to start making them act
[39:09] towards what other children say about
[39:11] them
[39:11] then they're going to begin to look at
[39:13] themselves i'm nothing
[39:15] i'm ugly bars will be like look in the
[39:18] mirror i'm a wimp
[39:20] look at me look at that that's just
[39:22] complexes
[39:23] and you're letting them control you but
[39:25] i'm here to tell you
[39:26] you're fearfully and wonderfully made
[39:28] you are exactly how god wanted you to be
[39:32] and you don't have to worry about what
[39:33] nobody will say about you
[39:36] amen praise the lord because when you
[39:38] let them things get on you
[39:40] you're going to start dressing to try to
[39:42] please somebody else
[39:43] fixing your hair trying to please
[39:44] somebody else just to fit in with a
[39:47] certain group and that is wrong
[39:48] and that's going to drive you in the
[39:50] wrong direction i promise you it will
[39:53] so be thankful for what god has made
[39:56] you now i want to preach a youth meeting
[40:01] but let me just stay with this
[40:06] my wife my wife she's a excellent baker
[40:11] when i say excellent she's excellent
[40:14] and she can bake
[40:18] sometimes when she get a recipe book she
[40:20] might find a cake
[40:22] or something in there that she never did
[40:25] and uh and i could come into the house
[40:30] she can have that recipe book looking in
[40:33] it
[40:35] and you can tell she's in it she just be
[40:37] like
[40:40] i mean you can say something
[40:45] because she don't seen a cake that she
[40:48] want to make
[40:49] and she gonna and she has a vision
[40:52] now once she see the cake that she wants
[40:54] to make
[40:55] she actually already see the cake
[40:58] sitting on the table but it's not there
[41:04] so what she start doing she'll look at
[41:06] the book
[41:08] and start looking at the ingredients
[41:10] she'll go in the refrigerator
[41:12] start pulling things out see
[41:15] she got the she want that cake to come
[41:18] out just the way that she's seen it
[41:20] so she got to go by what the book says
[41:24] she can't change nothing and she can't
[41:26] add nothing
[41:27] she wanted to be exactly like the book
[41:30] says
[41:32] when she begins to get all of those
[41:34] ingredients and
[41:35] lay them on the table and sit them down
[41:37] and then get a big old bowl
[41:39] and and you can stand back and watch her
[41:42] man she'd be anointed
[41:45] you know when you're really into
[41:46] something you're annoying it when you do
[41:47] it
[41:48] can we say man how many of your brothers
[41:50] don't got anointed a time or two when
[41:52] you're cutting your grass at your house
[41:55] anybody some of you don't like cutting
[41:57] grass then
[41:59] you know when you cutting that grass
[42:01] when you're really in it you just
[42:05] you know then when you look back because
[42:08] it's your yard
[42:10] now when your son cut it he ain't doing
[42:11] it he just want to get it over with he
[42:14] just
[42:19] right so that's a different now you let
[42:22] them cut your head just
[42:24] oh you know but when you do it because
[42:30] you're anointed
[42:32] you're anointed he's annoyed
[42:37] but you know i began to watch my wife
[42:41] she get all these things there then she
[42:44] get the bowl
[42:47] she start throwing in salt she starts
[42:49] throwing in
[42:50] uh sugar and then you know to break her
[42:52] egg
[42:53] sitting it all inside of the bowl when
[42:56] you go look inside that bowl
[42:58] you see a bunch of ingredients sitting
[43:00] on the top
[43:02] now looking at them you can kind of tell
[43:04] which is which egg
[43:06] salt big chunk of butter and all that
[43:07] that's just sitting there
[43:10] but still there's no cake
[43:14] but she sees the cake then all of a
[43:17] sudden she get that bowl
[43:19] she stick that kitchenaid i think that's
[43:21] what you call him
[43:22] starts stirring it all up
[43:26] and as she's stirring it all up when
[43:28] she's finished stirring it if you look
[43:29] in the bowl now
[43:31] you can't tell which ingredient is which
[43:34] but yet every one of us is in there
[43:38] but still ain't no cake
[43:41] then also she started separating them
[43:44] pouring into the can
[43:45] is gonna be two layer cake three layer
[43:47] cake she just start doing all of that
[43:50] still it's no cake
[43:53] but with all the ingredients there
[43:55] everything stirred up
[43:59] nothing brings nothing together
[44:02] without heat
[44:05] she gotta stick it in the oven and when
[44:08] she sticks it in the oven
[44:10] the heat start causing all of those
[44:13] different ingredients
[44:14] that's been put in there to start
[44:16] forming
[44:18] so a cake can start coming together
[44:24] you see you and i we are god's bold
[44:28] well he throw ingredients in your life
[44:31] so he can bring out a son
[44:35] what's so interesting sometimes my wife
[44:37] have a cake in the oven and i don't know
[44:39] it
[44:41] and me and my son might come in the
[44:43] house and stomping our feet
[44:44] and she'll go stop and we just
[44:50] what she said there's a cake
[44:53] in the oven she said if you walk too
[44:55] hard
[44:56] it's gonna fall i said my goodness
[45:01] let me tell you when god don't put so
[45:03] many ingredients in your life
[45:05] you need to walk soft not hard
[45:09] so you won't fall he's doing some
[45:12] working
[45:14] see a lot of times god put all kind of
[45:15] ingredients in our life we just start
[45:16] spinning around
[45:18] oh what is going on what is going on you
[45:20] just gonna keep going down
[45:22] down down but you need to stop
[45:26] walk saw and pray
[45:29] because god is working on
[45:33] you are you with me
[45:37] so all the ingredients she put in there
[45:40] is for the purpose for a cake and then
[45:44] of course
[45:45] when the cake she done baked it she put
[45:46] it in it she separated let them cool off
[45:49] put all the whipped cream and all the
[45:51] stuff on top then we come in and say oh
[45:53] that's a beautiful cake
[45:54] but look what it went through before it
[45:57] got there
[45:59] so that is why you and i when we're
[46:01] talking about adoption
[46:03] god takes you through things to get you
[46:06] where he wants you to be and most of the
[46:10] times
[46:11] we miss it oh yeah
[46:14] we miss it before i go i want to go to
[46:18] genesis let me give you
[46:19] another example
[46:22] my neighbor it was this guy it was a
[46:26] church
[46:27] when i used to rent this house it was
[46:29] this uh a rent from a church
[46:32] and and and this guy come over my house
[46:35] one day he said
[46:36] he said hey mr win i'm retired and i got
[46:38] a lawnmower service
[46:39] he said i like to cut your grass and he
[46:42] was the one kind of instrumental to talk
[46:43] to the people that let me get the house
[46:46] and i told him i said uh i said well i
[46:48] got this big old boy here
[46:50] he cut the grass and i offended him
[46:53] but i wasn't trying to offend him i was
[46:55] just telling him it don't make no sense
[46:56] to me to pay you to cut my grass and i
[46:58] got this big old boy
[46:59] eating all these biscuits and stuff for
[47:00] free i mean come on he got to do
[47:02] something
[47:03] i mean that's kind of senseless isn't it
[47:07] he i didn't know i made him mad
[47:10] so what happened he cut it he cut the
[47:14] yards around my house
[47:16] and one day i was just standing standing
[47:19] and looked at my yard and he was cutting
[47:20] one of the neighbor's grass
[47:22] and there was some branches in their
[47:24] yard he started kicking them in my yard
[47:27] what is he doing you just start kicking
[47:29] them in my yard
[47:30] and you know how they make sure the
[47:31] exhaust is shooting right in your yard
[47:34] you know what i'm talking about some of
[47:36] you and i'm like
[47:38] what's wrong with this man they said wow
[47:42] so that day went by then another day
[47:44] come by and
[47:45] he was cutting the church grass and no
[47:48] paper in the church grass but he made
[47:49] sure that paper shot right over in my
[47:51] yard
[47:52] and i'm looking at him what's wrong with
[47:54] this guy
[47:55] and then to top it all off it was a beer
[47:58] can in the church grass
[47:59] he said he stopped and looked at the
[48:01] beer can then he said
[48:03] kicked it right in my yard that's it
[48:07] that's it i got on my phone
[48:11] i called the man over the church i said

[48:14] said
[48:15] he don't need to be doing that this is
[48:17] crazy he said okay i'll talk to him

[49:50] about this tall could you imagine what
[49:52] was going on in my mind
[49:54] just one swing
[49:58] see the devil started anointing me just
[50:01] one oh just one i'm just looking and
[50:04] just analyzing it
[50:08] i did not know my daughter was up in the
[50:10] window was looking at me though
[50:12] that's what i didn't know until later he
[50:15] said you're gonna make me sad
[50:16] he said he's talking about black people
[50:19] he said you are the
[50:20] low down score of the earth
[50:23] i said
[50:29] i said listen man i said i'm gonna call
[50:32] you a pastor i
[50:33] don't care that's something to tell your
[50:35] whole church about it i
[50:37] don't care i'm out here arguing with
[50:39] this man
[50:40] but you know what i failed the test
[50:45] i let him get in my spirit i wasn't
[50:47] sanctifying myself for my neighbor
[50:52] god allowed that to happen just to see
[50:55] how i was going to respond
[50:58] i failed see so many
[51:01] little things god is doing in our lives
[51:04] we just overlook it but he's working
[51:09] on us all right
[51:12] since i got your attention
[51:17] come with me to genesis 37.
[51:31] i want to talk about the life of joseph
[51:33] for a moment to give a comparison
[51:41] every one of us got ingredients in our
[51:44] life
[51:45] god didn't put there and he didn't allow
[51:48] things to happen
[51:50] every one of us but you have to discern
[51:52] what they are
[51:54] and see is god doing this
[51:58] when i look at the life of joseph one of
[52:01] the first ingredients
[52:02] that god put in joseph's life it
[52:05] actually was his father
[52:07] it wasn't his brother's it was his
[52:09] father
[52:11] god had to have joseph's father do the
[52:14] things that he did
[52:15] to get things to start moving
[52:18] are you with me joseph brethren
[52:22] couldn't hate him if his father didn't
[52:25] start doing things first
[52:28] are you with me let's just watch the
[52:30] scripture genesis 3 37 verse 3.
[52:33] it's in the israel love joseph more than
[52:36] all his children that's pretty strong
[52:39] right there
[52:42] how many of you young people feel like
[52:43] mama loved the other
[52:45] your brother better go ahead and raise
[52:48] your hand i know you're here
[52:52] well daddy loves you better than me no
[52:54] he don't he loves us the same oh no he
[52:56] don't
[52:56] you know they can pick things up
[53:00] [Music]
[53:04] and it causes problems
[53:07] daddy's favorite mommy's favorite
[53:11] it causes problems
[53:14] you know what tickled me about david's
[53:16] life
[53:17] you can tell david and his brothers
[53:19] argued a lot
[53:20] because you remember when david went
[53:21] down there to see how they were doing
[53:24] and then they started they said we know
[53:25] why you come here and david said now
[53:27] what have i done now
[53:30] that goes to show you david been getting
[53:32] a lot of accusations upon him
[53:34] that's right it's sibling battles
[53:39] oh i'll tell you right now i know how
[53:41] those things go especially with my
[53:43] my three youngest when they're still
[53:44] with me that you know my
[53:47] my son my youngest my son
[53:50] it's kind of bad but it's nature
[53:54] most of the time a mother protects
[53:57] her son and then the father protects the
[54:00] daughter
[54:03] hello don't don't act like you innocent
[54:08] it's just nature and sometimes in the
[54:11] mother's eyes
[54:12] junior can't do nothing wrong and then
[54:16] the daughters be like
[54:18] you let him get away with that you won't
[54:21] let her get away with that
[54:22] she said he's fine he didn't do nothing
[54:24] and they like
[54:25] wow i must be blind with him
[54:30] that's right and then the daddy we
[54:32] talking to his daughter
[54:34] what's wrong with sweet what's wrong you
[54:36] be talking to
[54:37] and the boy do something what what you
[54:39] do that for boy what's wrong with you he
[54:41] like
[54:41] can't you talk to me like that because
[54:43] you're not a girl
[54:46] so it brings little favoritism and stuff
[54:48] in the family
[54:49] that's why be honest with you we have to
[54:51] balance those things
[54:53] to make sure our children know i love
[54:55] you all
[54:56] the same
[54:59] right but see now i got a little
[55:01] granddaughter now
[55:04] that's a problem that's a problem
[55:08] and she know how to get things out of me
[55:11] and it's hard to say no
[55:14] and now my daughter she's not looking at
[55:16] my grandma
[55:17] now she used to get all the attention
[55:19] now i got my granddaughter there my
[55:21] daughter like
[55:23] nah come on you 25 years old she's just
[55:25] seven years old that's no comparison
[55:27] but it is when that's daddy's little
[55:30] girl but now she see a
[55:32] intruder
[55:36] my granddaughter she just i can just see
[55:39] her coming man
[55:40] when she wants something she got
[55:44] i try not to look
[55:47] because i'm just going to say yeah you
[55:49] know you try to look away
[55:51] they come right up to you and don't say
[55:54] it loudly whispering
[55:56] papa
[55:59] what is it
[56:02] can i have dessert you sure can
[56:08] now my grandson was coming down papa
[56:10] come get some dessert
[56:13] you don't need no dessert you don't need
[56:15] no sweets boy
[56:17] that's wrong
[56:20] it's wrong
[56:24] she's an ingredient
[56:29] i'm saying that to say this by him
[56:32] expressing
[56:33] that he loved joseph more than all the
[56:36] rest of his brothers
[56:38] they see that but it had to be
[56:43] to catch the story brothers and sisters
[56:46] god needed joseph in egypt
[56:51] but he had to do things allow things to
[56:54] happen to get
[56:55] joseph there and he used his father
[57:00] and his brothers let me just show you
[57:02] something here are we all right tonight
[57:07] verse 4 when his brother saw that the
[57:10] father loved him more than
[57:12] all his brethren they hated him and
[57:14] could not speak
[57:16] peacefully in him if you notice the
[57:18] scripture they are watching joseph
[57:20] relationship in his father relationship
[57:22] and his bringing hate
[57:25] it had to let hate be generated
[57:28] to get joseph to egypt god
[57:31] focus at this time is not on joseph's
[57:35] brothers
[57:36] his focus is on joseph but he said i got
[57:40] to do things in this man's life to get
[57:42] him where i want him
[57:43] so when god is doing something to you
[57:45] and when he's allowing people to do
[57:47] things to you
[57:48] his focus is not on the people that's
[57:50] doing it to you his focus is actually on
[57:52] you
[57:54] and we like what are you talking to me
[57:56] like that why are you treating me like
[57:57] that what's going on what's wrong i
[57:58] ain't got nothing to you
[58:00] that's right god preventing it
[58:04] and there ain't nothing you can do to
[58:07] change it
[58:12] how many you don't even try to go to
[58:13] christian way try to talk to somebody
[58:15] have i done anything to you they say no
[58:19] why are you treating me like this i just
[58:21] want we're brother i just won't have
[58:22] peace with you so i'm i'm fine
[58:25] but but then you just walk off
[58:31] god got that person like that
[58:34] just to work on you
[58:38] and you don't know everything you don't
[58:39] know christian like
[58:41] and it seems like they just still don't
[58:43] like you
[58:44] god is permitting that to work on
[58:48] you
[58:53] let's go to verse 5.
[58:57] joseph didn't make that no better either
[59:00] joseph dreamed the dream
[59:01] told it to his brethren they hated him
[59:04] yet the more you see
[59:07] when god is permitting something to
[59:09] happen i don't care what you try to keep
[59:11] doing it
[59:12] it makes no difference what joseph did
[59:14] he could have cooked them something they
[59:15] still
[59:16] don't hate him he could have bought him
[59:19] something they still was going to hate
[59:20] him
[59:21] because god focus was on
[59:24] joseph verse 6
[59:27] he said here i pray you this dream which
[59:30] i have dreamed
[59:31] y'all know the story i'm not going to
[59:32] just keep reading i'm just giving you
[59:33] some little
[59:34] clips here to get where i want to get to
[59:36] to show you how this is building up
[59:38] when joseph just telling the dreams all
[59:41] of these things it's just ingredients
[59:42] being put in the pot
[59:46] it's the only thing it is are you with
[59:48] me
[59:50] let's go to verse 18.
[59:53] when they saw him afar off even before
[59:56] he came near to them
[59:57] they conspired against him to slam you
[59:59] know this is a stone when joseph hadn't
[1:00:01] taught him
[1:00:02] they see him coming now they say we
[1:00:03] don't have to get rid of this guy
[1:00:05] all of these things friends i hope
[1:00:07] you're really catching what i'm saying
[1:00:09] all of these things they cannot change
[1:00:13] you know and i know that's that's you we
[1:00:16] ask ourselves
[1:00:17] how could a person treat somebody like
[1:00:19] this when you haven't done nothing to
[1:00:21] them
[1:00:22] all of these things is in god's program
[1:00:26] it goes right back to the scripture when
[1:00:28] god's gonna put it in the hearts
[1:00:29] of the other ones to hate the in
[1:00:31] the book of revelation when god put it
[1:00:33] in their heart
[1:00:34] you can't stop it can we say amen
[1:00:37] when god do something you can't stop
[1:00:39] even in jared the book of jeremiah
[1:00:42] when uh jeremiah telling them that
[1:00:43] nebuchadnezzar was coming down there he
[1:00:45] said surrender yourself to him
[1:00:47] and god told him your weapons ain't
[1:00:48] going to work your army ain't going to
[1:00:50] work you might as just surrender
[1:00:51] because god put it in their heart you
[1:00:54] can't change it
[1:00:56] that's just where it is
[1:01:00] verse 39
[1:01:03] i'm sorry chapter 39 verse 7.
[1:01:10] just they just skipped they were going
[1:01:11] to skip a little bit
[1:01:13] you know when joseph got brother and
[1:01:15] they sold him we know the story i know
[1:01:17] y'all well talk
[1:01:18] when joseph got down in egypt you know
[1:01:21] actually when he got down in egypt
[1:01:23] things was going real
[1:01:24] good for him got a good job
[1:01:28] good retirement plan 401k
[1:01:32] joseph had it going on but you know what
[1:01:35] he still wasn't in the place where god
[1:01:38] needed them to be
[1:01:40] now he goes joseph just minding his
[1:01:42] business good job man
[1:01:43] everything i'm pretty sure probably his
[1:01:45] mind who need brothers
[1:01:47] so me that's all right you sold me but
[1:01:50] look what i got now
[1:01:52] i got a good job i don't need no
[1:01:54] brothers i'm good
[1:01:56] god said nope i got another ingredient
[1:01:59] i have designed to put in your life
[1:02:04] and it said in genesis 39 7 and it came
[1:02:07] to pass
[1:02:07] after these things that his masterwise
[1:02:10] cast their eyes upon joseph
[1:02:12] and she said lie with me the only thing
[1:02:14] that woman was was another ingredient
[1:02:16] god threw it in the pot
[1:02:20] because he need to keep pushing jose
[1:02:23] joseph character was not yet
[1:02:27] where god needed it his behavior
[1:02:30] is not yet what god needed then we find
[1:02:33] joseph
[1:02:34] down in prison
[1:02:37] are you with me
[1:02:40] let's go to verse 20.
[1:02:43] and joseph master took him and put him
[1:02:45] in the prison and placed where the
[1:02:47] king's prisoner was bound
[1:02:48] and he was there in prison but the lord
[1:02:51] was with joseph
[1:02:52] showed him mercy gave him favor in the
[1:02:54] sight of the keeper
[1:02:55] of the prison now do you think at this
[1:02:58] time when joseph is in prison
[1:02:59] if you went down and told joseph god is
[1:03:01] with you you think joseph would have
[1:03:03] believed you
[1:03:06] god is with you joseph joseph like
[1:03:10] i'm in prison and you're telling me god
[1:03:13] with me
[1:03:13] yep he's with you joseph couldn't see it
[1:03:16] but god was right there
[1:03:17] so a lot of times when we get called
[1:03:19] into our emotional prisons
[1:03:22] a life cares and things of life god is
[1:03:25] still
[1:03:25] right there he's working on
[1:03:29] you i just love this story so much can
[1:03:32] be preached here but
[1:03:34] let's just keep it this way
[1:03:37] and if you notice verse 21 of verse 22
[1:03:41] and the keeper of the prayers are
[1:03:42] committed to joseph and
[1:03:44] all the prisoners that was in the prison
[1:03:47] and whatsoever they did there
[1:03:49] he was the doer of it you see now god is
[1:03:52] still
[1:03:53] working on joseph more than joseph life
[1:03:56] now you remember when they came to
[1:03:58] joseph and they told joseph they had a
[1:03:59] dream you don't see joseph
[1:04:01] tell it to metallica i'll interpret it i
[1:04:03] got it break it there i'll break it down
[1:04:05] for you nope
[1:04:06] he said god can interpret these things
[1:04:08] see joseph character is changing
[1:04:11] from his ability to what he think he
[1:04:13] could do
[1:04:14] what he can say to now he's relying on
[1:04:16] god see
[1:04:17] his character is changing god can give
[1:04:20] the interpretation
[1:04:21] god is now mellowing joseph down
[1:04:28] you remember the bible say you see a man
[1:04:29] hasting his word there's more hope
[1:04:31] for him than a more hope for food than
[1:04:33] him
[1:04:35] that's what the bible said a person that
[1:04:37] can oh i got to ask
[1:04:38] tell me i got i'll break it down for you
[1:04:40] what when a person say they got all that
[1:04:42] else oh my god i got
[1:04:43] a guy his character is not right god
[1:04:46] still have to keep working on him
[1:04:48] that's his immaturity of life but god
[1:04:52] is working
[1:04:55] keep going with me here now you know the
[1:04:59] story
[1:05:00] genesis 40 verse 8 they said unto him we
[1:05:04] have dream of dream
[1:05:05] there is no interpreter of it joseph
[1:05:07] said it to them
[1:05:08] do not interpretation belong to god tell
[1:05:11] me
[1:05:12] them i pray you see how his character is
[1:05:15] kind of being molded
[1:05:16] he's not trusting in his own ability he
[1:05:18] said god can do this
[1:05:21] see now we all have to come to that
[1:05:23] place even in our lives
[1:05:25] lord how do you want me to respond what
[1:05:27] do i need to do what do i need to say
[1:05:29] let me approach this thing the right way
[1:05:33] so it won't be damaged though now we're
[1:05:35] not relying on our flesh
[1:05:37] and i'ma promise you when you keep going
[1:05:39] through a bunch of failures like that
[1:05:41] failures and failures then god start you
[1:05:44] begin to realize it's nothing but
[1:05:46] failures
[1:05:46] then when you start maturing you'll
[1:05:49] actually become to a place
[1:05:51] you just know how to handle situations
[1:05:53] you ain't got to say
[1:05:54] god what should i do about it you'll
[1:05:56] become so much maturity you'll just know
[1:06:00] that's what god wants us to be to we
[1:06:02] would just
[1:06:03] no are you with me
[1:06:06] joshua he knew he needed more time to
[1:06:09] win the war
[1:06:11] son you stand over there joshua not only
[1:06:14] spoke to the son in the moon he actually
[1:06:16] told him where to go
[1:06:18] because he knew he needed that time look
[1:06:21] how mature he was
[1:06:24] you know joshua in the beginning was not
[1:06:27] that mature
[1:06:31] uh let me give you an example
[1:06:34] how many of you remember the story when
[1:06:36] the children of israel were down there
[1:06:37] dancing around that golden calf
[1:06:41] you know joseph i mean joshua and moses
[1:06:45] heard
[1:06:46] the same sound
[1:06:49] joshua's thought the enemy there
[1:06:52] overtaking them
[1:06:53] he said moses they being overtaken moses
[1:06:56] heard
[1:06:56] moses said don't sound like nobody being
[1:06:58] overtaken
[1:07:00] does that sound like a party to me think
[1:07:02] about it they both heard the same
[1:07:04] cry but got two different
[1:07:07] interpretations
[1:07:10] moses interpretation was right joshuas
[1:07:13] was wrong
[1:07:16] and it's based upon moses was more
[1:07:18] immature
[1:07:20] than joshua they heard the same cry
[1:07:23] but different interpretations you know
[1:07:27] what brothers and sisters
[1:07:28] that's a lesson to learn right there
[1:07:32] especially with a man a man
[1:07:36] get more irritated quicker than a woman
[1:07:39] whether we want to admit it not
[1:07:42] we get irritated well sometimes when we
[1:07:45] fail as brethren
[1:07:46] we can't unders we can't we don't
[1:07:48] discern
[1:07:50] if our wife is crying or complaining
[1:07:55] sometimes when your wife is talking to
[1:07:57] you about something you can say
[1:07:59] then you're gonna complain it again ah
[1:08:01] man it might not even be a complaint
[1:08:04] it's a cry
[1:08:07] and you look at it as a complaint you
[1:08:09] have to be able to deserve
[1:08:11] between bodies awful quiet
[1:08:19] amen praise the lord sometimes she might
[1:08:22] give you a call
[1:08:26] how you doing and you like
[1:08:32] fine she said oh
[1:08:35] i just call okay
[1:08:39] okay what is it didn't you just say
[1:08:42] nothing
[1:08:44] you failed to hear the cry
[1:08:52] that's right she just won't fellowship
[1:08:55] now
[1:08:56] she want to talk to you she missed you
[1:08:59] that's why she called you
[1:09:01] but can you tell me you could have told
[1:09:04] me this when i got home
[1:09:06] you failed
[1:09:09] that's right sister you missed it
[1:09:13] sometime
[1:09:14] husband's sitting in the chair
[1:09:18] you are by here look at you and look
[1:09:19] away you just you just
[1:09:22] oh come on kid he just
[1:09:26] come on come on come on come on come on
[1:09:26] y'all ready ready he just
[1:09:31] and you don't catch it he's crying
[1:09:35] he needs your attention but you're so
[1:09:38] locked
[1:09:38] in on the children you ain't seeing his
[1:09:40] knees
[1:09:43] discernment fail then
[1:09:46] he gets an attitude now you say
[1:09:48] something here what
[1:09:50] see in his mind he saw me over there
[1:09:53] you saw how i was looking at you he
[1:09:55] going over everything that he
[1:09:56] think you should have seen so now
[1:10:01] i ain't gonna pay you no attention and
[1:10:02] the bible said don't render evil for
[1:10:04] evil
[1:10:08] miss the cry
[1:10:11] and you know what makes it worse when
[1:10:14] you miss the cry of your wife
[1:10:16] when you miss that cry and then you know
[1:10:19] another sister need prayer
[1:10:22] then you go to your wife we need to pray
[1:10:24] for sister so-and-so
[1:10:25] she's really going through something
[1:10:27] she'd be like
[1:10:29] really and you can't see where i'm going
[1:10:34] and she'll pray but it won't be sincere
[1:10:37] she gonna pray with her help her lord
[1:10:39] she needs you
[1:10:41] we all need you children each blessing
[1:10:44] lord
[1:10:45] that's it see these
[1:10:49] little things right here that is so
[1:10:51] overlooked
[1:10:54] but it's it's what character is being
[1:10:56] developed
[1:11:06] it's in there
[1:11:12] now
[1:11:15] joseph i don't we don't have to read it
[1:11:17] you know the story
[1:11:21] you remember joseph told them
[1:11:26] remember me
[1:11:29] and actually hold on a minute i want to
[1:11:32] make sure i get it right
[1:11:34] i think it was the uh which one of them
[1:11:37] he told him to remember me and he
[1:11:39] actually forgot about joseph
[1:11:42] but god didn't forget about joseph there
[1:11:45] was no way in the world god could have
[1:11:46] forgot about joseph
[1:11:48] because he got joseph real close to
[1:11:51] where he want joseph to be
[1:11:54] and then we see let's just jump to
[1:11:57] genesis 41.
[1:12:01] i'm skipping a lot of stuff
[1:12:08] we understand when joseph came up out of
[1:12:10] the prison
[1:12:12] the bible said he shaved himself
[1:12:15] and then when he went to go stand before
[1:12:16] pharaoh
[1:12:18] joseph actually was fitting to get
[1:12:20] something he wasn't looking for
[1:12:22] and we understand by studying the
[1:12:24] message of the hour
[1:12:25] what pharaoh did to joseph when he put
[1:12:28] the rings on him in the robe and stuff
[1:12:30] he gave joseph an adoption ceremony
[1:12:34] that's what he gave joseph because now
[1:12:38] god got joseph close
[1:12:42] to where he wanted now he goes joseph
[1:12:45] walking around
[1:12:46] with all the authority you see
[1:12:49] when god when you even when you can
[1:12:52] be where you think you're supposed to be
[1:12:54] and you don't reach the level where you
[1:12:56] think you need to reach
[1:12:58] god still ain't finished
[1:13:01] because you just imagine when joseph was
[1:13:04] now
[1:13:05] pharaoh said you're next to me whatever
[1:13:07] joseph say you need something whatever
[1:13:09] joseph say
[1:13:10] could you just imagine all that power
[1:13:11] joseph got now
[1:13:16] now what if that woman
[1:13:19] was still alive that told that lie on
[1:13:22] joseph
[1:13:24] now she see joseph with pharaoh
[1:13:27] and why joseph coming down the chariot
[1:13:30] people
[1:13:31] sad y'all son and joseph sitting up
[1:13:33] there and then
[1:13:34] she's on the side yay
[1:13:38] tell sir and then he go
[1:13:43] i remember you he could have just said
[1:13:47] one word and they would have killed him
[1:13:50] but now he got power
[1:13:53] and character he wouldn't have bothered
[1:13:56] that woman
[1:14:00] because now god got joseph
[1:14:03] in power but now he's going to give him
[1:14:05] some more trials about his character
[1:14:09] this is so beautiful let's just keep
[1:14:12] this let me just show this to you
[1:14:17] i want to just read i just go to genesis
[1:14:19] 41 39
[1:14:21] pharaoh said unto joseph for much as god
[1:14:23] has showed thee all this
[1:14:25] there is none so discreet and wise is
[1:14:27] thou art
[1:14:28] thou shalt be over my house according to
[1:14:30] the and according to thy word
[1:14:32] shall all my people be rude
[1:14:35] only in the throne would i be greater
[1:14:37] than thou here comes a man
[1:14:39] from the prison to the throne
[1:14:42] but look what it took to get him there
[1:14:48] pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set
[1:14:49] thee over the land of egypt
[1:14:51] pharaoh took off his reign from his hand
[1:14:53] put it on joseph's hand
[1:14:55] arrayed him investors of fine line and
[1:14:57] put a gold chain about his neck
[1:14:59] he made him the ride in the second
[1:15:01] chariot which he had
[1:15:03] they cried before he about the knee he
[1:15:05] made him ruler over
[1:15:06] all the land of egypt and pharaoh said
[1:15:10] unto joseph
[1:15:10] i am pharaoh and without thee shall no
[1:15:14] man lift up his hand a
[1:15:15] foot in all the land of egypt
[1:15:19] now you talking about a man in position
[1:15:21] for revenge
[1:15:24] he's in position for revenge
[1:15:28] chapter 45
[1:15:36] we read this story a lot
[1:15:40] of course which depends on what thought
[1:15:43] that we're using
[1:15:44] right here now you know we can preach
[1:15:46] the feasts of the trumpets because
[1:15:47] that's what was happening joseph's
[1:15:49] brother-in-law
[1:15:50] trumpets was blowing to get them to come
[1:15:52] to joseph we can preach on the feast of
[1:15:54] the trumpet really easily right here
[1:15:56] but that's not my thought my thought
[1:15:59] is adoption and character
[1:16:03] to show you joseph passed the test now
[1:16:06] you remember when joseph brother was
[1:16:08] coming to him
[1:16:10] with that power joseph god he could have
[1:16:12] easily
[1:16:13] destroyed them but he didn't
[1:16:18] so now what god do to us a lot of times
[1:16:22] brothers is to put things in your hands
[1:16:25] and see what you're going to do with it
[1:16:28] and place it right in your hand
[1:16:31] joseph brethren was put in his hand you
[1:16:33] remember when brother branham
[1:16:35] and two kids acting up in church they
[1:16:37] was placed in his hands
[1:16:41] and god said what are you going to do he
[1:16:43] said forgive him
[1:16:44] he said that's what i wanted you to say
[1:16:47] but he could have got
[1:16:48] irritated and you know but he don't mind
[1:16:51] blasting stuff
[1:16:53] bob had it he just blasted but now they
[1:16:55] laid in his hand he said forgive him
[1:16:58] but in his case he was previously warned
[1:17:02] that the devil had a trap now you and i
[1:17:06] don't get spoken to like that the devil
[1:17:08] got a trap and be previously warned
[1:17:11] god let us go through things but now we
[1:17:13] have to come to a place in life where we
[1:17:14] can catch it
[1:17:18] that's right
[1:17:22] but the thing that i love about this
[1:17:24] whole story
[1:17:27] first genesis 45
[1:17:30] 4 joseph said unto his brethren come
[1:17:33] near to me
[1:17:34] i pray you and they come near he said i
[1:17:37] am joseph your brother
[1:17:39] whom you sowed in egypt now therefore be
[1:17:42] not grieved nor angry with yourself
[1:17:44] that you sold me hither for god
[1:17:48] did send me before you to preserve life
[1:17:52] look look how he changed it don't you be
[1:17:55] angry
[1:17:56] god did this how many of us can say that
[1:18:00] when things have been done wrong
[1:18:02] we can just tell somebody it's okay
[1:18:04] brother
[1:18:06] god permitted this
[1:18:09] and it gets even better listen to what
[1:18:12] he says
[1:18:12] verse 8 he says so
[1:18:16] now it was not you that sent
[1:18:19] me hither but god
[1:18:23] and he has made me a father over pharaoh
[1:18:26] and lord over his house
[1:18:27] and a ruler throughout all the land of
[1:18:29] egypt now if you go up further
[1:18:31] pharaoh's told joseph i made you ruler
[1:18:34] but now joseph's saying no
[1:18:35] god made me rude pharaoh
[1:18:38] thought he did it he was just another
[1:18:41] ingredient to help joseph to get where
[1:18:43] he need to get to
[1:18:46] brother and sister i'll be honest with
[1:18:47] you
[1:18:49] when we can say it from our heart when
[1:18:51] things are going wrong
[1:18:53] but what we can really say from our
[1:18:55] heart god
[1:18:56] you're working on me you are doing
[1:19:00] this because now when joseph got into
[1:19:04] his place
[1:19:06] he was able to help the ones that sold
[1:19:08] him
[1:19:10] so when we get into our place he can use
[1:19:13] us to turn back around to help the ones
[1:19:15] that cause us the problems
[1:19:17] turn right back around now we can help
[1:19:18] him but first he got to work on us
[1:19:22] that's where it starts
[1:19:28] and it's painful
[1:19:32] but we got to learn
[1:19:35] praise god amen praise god
[1:19:41] can i go just a little bit more
[1:19:46] i want to turn to the book of proverbs
[1:19:48] and
[1:19:54] proverbs 29
[1:20:01] remember jesus told his disciples
[1:20:06] i no longer call you servants i call you
[1:20:09] friends
[1:20:11] let me remember that scripture what
[1:20:14] jesus was doing
[1:20:15] he knowing that they're coming up in a
[1:20:17] higher level to his speech to them
[1:20:19] let them know you're not friends not
[1:20:22] servants
[1:20:24] then he tells us even in galatians paul
[1:20:27] said
[1:20:28] you're no longer servants your sons
[1:20:33] a servant and a son two different people
[1:20:39] see let me just explain that
[1:20:43] a servant attitude is totally different
[1:20:47] from a son's attitude
[1:20:49] a son attitude sees the responsibility
[1:20:54] that's what he sees i need to do this
[1:20:56] and not just to want this is a need and
[1:20:58] i need to do it that's the way sons look
[1:21:00] at things
[1:21:01] but servants look at things get somebody
[1:21:04] else to do it
[1:21:05] why me why i have to do it why can't
[1:21:08] somebody else do it see that's how
[1:21:09] servants think
[1:21:12] see that's why your children when i was
[1:21:15] children are growing up they got servant
[1:21:16] spirits
[1:21:19] hello i gotta do this again what can you
[1:21:22] tell her to do it why me i gotta do it
[1:21:24] he's just a servant
[1:21:27] but when that child starts growing and
[1:21:29] that sonship start coming in their life
[1:21:31] you'll start watching and do things for
[1:21:33] even his siblings let me get that for
[1:21:35] you let me do that for you
[1:21:36] because now he's seeing responsibility
[1:21:39] and it automatically starts happening
[1:21:42] you see servants
[1:21:43] can see something to need in the church
[1:21:46] they say why is somebody doing this why
[1:21:48] is somebody doing that why did that
[1:21:49] and they won't put up a finger to go do
[1:21:51] it that's a servant
[1:21:54] and then when somebody do it the service
[1:21:56] say they didn't even do it right
[1:21:58] see that's a servant but a son
[1:22:01] i see the need just let me do it if i'm
[1:22:04] able i can do it
[1:22:05] see it's different
[1:22:09] oh yeah it's very different
[1:22:14] this is going to bring us back even to
[1:22:16] ministry
[1:22:18] see even in ministry we as ministers
[1:22:21] can't have servant attitudes
[1:22:25] we've got to have sun attitudes let me
[1:22:28] just explain this in a minute let's go
[1:22:30] to proverbs 29
[1:22:34] verse 17 correct thy son
[1:22:38] he shall give thee rest he shall get
[1:22:41] right into thy soul
[1:22:44] they say i shouldn't ain't got no rest
[1:22:46] right now
[1:22:48] no you gotta keep correcting me it
[1:22:50] eventually be rest
[1:22:51] and i'm gonna tell you what that rest
[1:22:52] would be your arm will be able to rest
[1:22:56] you don't have to spank him that much
[1:22:58] but then you have peace because
[1:23:00] by you correcting him when he begin to
[1:23:01] learn that'll be the less you have to
[1:23:03] correct him
[1:23:06] he said he's getting it or she's getting
[1:23:08] it
[1:23:09] but the bible said correct them we
[1:23:12] correct
[1:23:13] i think it's in the church eight book we
[1:23:15] don't punish
[1:23:17] we chastise not punished
[1:23:21] amen and like like the prophet said
[1:23:24] chastisement is you got the person
[1:23:28] betterment in view you're correcting
[1:23:30] them because you want them to be
[1:23:32] better that's the purpose it ain't be
[1:23:35] like
[1:23:35] come here you ah come here no
[1:23:40] no i need you to see something
[1:23:44] verse 18 where there is no vision
[1:23:48] the people perish but he that keep it
[1:23:51] the law
[1:23:52] is happy watch verse 19 a servant
[1:23:56] will not look at somebody and say will
[1:23:58] not
[1:24:01] be corrected by words
[1:24:05] for though he understand he will not
[1:24:08] answer
[1:24:08] other other words you can't take the
[1:24:11] word
[1:24:12] and correct them because they're not
[1:24:15] obedient
[1:24:16] to the word but they'll understand
[1:24:18] exactly what you're saying
[1:24:20] but they won't move you're taking the
[1:24:23] word you need to do
[1:24:24] can't you see what the words say they're
[1:24:25] like yeah yeah
[1:24:28] but you see no fruit in their lives
[1:24:33] that's right
[1:24:38] verse 20 see is thou a man that is hasty
[1:24:41] in his words
[1:24:42] this is what i was quoting earlier there
[1:24:44] is more hope of a fool than of him
[1:24:47] that's some strong language
[1:24:50] but it's bible language now
[1:24:53] this is the verse i love you know when
[1:24:56] you're speaking of sonship
[1:24:59] in the bible
[1:25:02] we know a servant can't be an
[1:25:06] heir a son
[1:25:09] is the air right that's why it says in
[1:25:13] the scripture he's different
[1:25:14] though he's a son but he different never
[1:25:17] nothing than a servant
[1:25:18] but only a son can be an heir see
[1:25:20] abraham knew that law
[1:25:22] you remember god promised him son and
[1:25:25] and
[1:25:25] gave him a promise but abraham said you
[1:25:28] gave me a promise but i have no son
[1:25:30] he's in this eleazar here i mean
[1:25:33] he he he ain't my son but he's like a
[1:25:36] son
[1:25:36] but he was eliezer was a servant but god
[1:25:39] said no
[1:25:40] out of your bowels shall be an heir see
[1:25:43] abraham knew that revelation
[1:25:45] so but when you look in scripture
[1:25:48] eliezer
[1:25:49] actually was like a son to abraham
[1:25:53] because of the way abraham trained him
[1:25:57] and watch the scripture verse 20 21
[1:26:01] he that delicately bring up
[1:26:04] his servant from a child
[1:26:08] shall have him become his son
[1:26:11] at the lent that's powerful
[1:26:14] other words i look at this even in
[1:26:17] ministry
[1:26:18] even sometimes in church you got people
[1:26:20] got servant attitudes
[1:26:22] but the ministry had to be able to take
[1:26:24] the word and use it so delicately
[1:26:27] and work with that individual until they
[1:26:30] become a son
[1:26:34] that's powerful
[1:26:40] but the word is what does it
[1:26:44] mean each one of us finding the will of
[1:26:48] god in our lives
[1:26:50] the ministers the ministry trusted in
[1:26:52] god for a message
[1:26:53] not just preaching it because it feels
[1:26:55] good to them or something they think
[1:26:57] no don't salt god and then the people
[1:27:00] are hungry
[1:27:00] then that word comes and it started
[1:27:03] molding us
[1:27:04] it started changing us then you can tell
[1:27:07] somebody say
[1:27:08] what happened to you as you could say
[1:27:11] the ministry changed me because the
[1:27:12] ministry is god's ministry
[1:27:14] not the man changed me that's how god
[1:27:19] operates and when you see people getting
[1:27:22] the pastor's spirit
[1:27:24] a lot of time because the way the pastor
[1:27:25] projected himself to the people
[1:27:28] and they get caught up into the man
[1:27:30] they're not getting caught up into
[1:27:31] christ
[1:27:32] i seen this time you got many people
[1:27:36] and because of immaturity in their life
[1:27:38] they get caught up into personalities
[1:27:41] and they're not getting caught up into
[1:27:43] the word
[1:27:46] praise the lord now i ain't saying
[1:27:48] nothing to this greek to ministry i'm
[1:27:50] telling you just how it's supposed to be
[1:27:52] and that takes training mistakes
[1:27:56] faults failures but learning from it
[1:28:00] that's what it takes and i'mma tell you
[1:28:03] i'm a good
[1:28:04] i'm a good learner i don't learn a lot
[1:28:07] and god makes sure i learn
[1:28:09] and it's very painful sometimes but when
[1:28:12] i see the outcome
[1:28:14] it's glorious because i want to see my
[1:28:17] church grow
[1:28:18] maybe not even in numbers but
[1:28:20] spiritually
[1:28:22] well i can be like paul i come among you
[1:28:24] save number jesus christ and him
[1:28:25] crucified
[1:28:26] when i come amongst you i don't want to
[1:28:28] see your sons and then this i want to
[1:28:29] see christ in your life
[1:28:31] that's what i want to see in my
[1:28:32] congregation
[1:28:35] and i want them to build it when they
[1:28:36] leave the service and god spoke to me
[1:28:38] god spoke to me i said god bless you
[1:28:42] you see even as a pastor
[1:28:45] i have to be able to discern when my
[1:28:48] church is complaining
[1:28:50] or crying i had to deserve anyone
[1:28:54] because i think
[1:28:55] here they go again hear all that man
[1:28:58] can you see i'm already stressed out
[1:29:00] this might be a cry in the congregation
[1:29:03] i had once i had a brother one time i
[1:29:05] had gotten
[1:29:06] going a little too much and he said but
[1:29:10] berlin
[1:29:10] said sir you know me and my wife were
[1:29:12] talking he said uh these brothers kind
[1:29:14] of need to leave you alone
[1:29:16] you're a pastor that wasn't a complaint
[1:29:19] that was a cry i caught it otherwise he
[1:29:22] was saying you've been going a little
[1:29:23] too much and we miss you
[1:29:27] and i had to catch it now if i didn't
[1:29:29] catch it i'd be like who do you think
[1:29:30] they
[1:29:31] don't control me i do what i want to do
[1:29:32] go where i want to go whenever i feel
[1:29:34] like it
[1:29:35] see i would have missed the whole thing
[1:29:39] even with our children you gotta catch
[1:29:42] it when they're complaining or crying
[1:29:44] most of the time we think they're
[1:29:45] complaining
[1:29:48] there you go with that again it could be
[1:29:50] going through something in school in
[1:29:51] life
[1:29:52] and they need to cry you need to hear
[1:29:53] the cry
[1:29:55] and get a child some attention
[1:29:58] can we say praise the lord but most of
[1:30:01] the times
[1:30:02] you know the bible tells us i think it's
[1:30:05] in the book of colossians or ephesians
[1:30:07] it talks about that you have the right
[1:30:10] to revenge disobedience
[1:30:12] when your obedience is for fear
[1:30:16] so it got to be something in us
[1:30:17] fulfilled too before we want to be
[1:30:20] correct disobedience all the time we got
[1:30:22] to be obedient to the word ourselves
[1:30:27] these simple little things right here
[1:30:30] i'm telling you is very very important
[1:30:32] we know the seals we know the trump
[1:30:34] we know it we can quote it by heart but
[1:30:37] let me tell you
[1:30:38] you got to become a part of our lives
[1:30:41] character have to go
[1:30:42] with what we're saying how many you know
[1:30:46] you know when you go into the grocery
[1:30:48] store you go to the fruit section
[1:30:52] how many of you ever heard a banana say
[1:30:54] i'm a banana
[1:30:55] how many of you ever heard of say hey
[1:30:57] look over here apple apple pear
[1:30:59] pear you don't hear nothing do you but
[1:31:02] you
[1:31:02] see fruit
[1:31:06] they don't have to speak for you to
[1:31:07] recognize what they are
[1:31:09] they see the light you see the fruit you
[1:31:11] see the life
[1:31:12] that's the same with christianity i
[1:31:14] don't have to go around prove nobody i'm
[1:31:16] in the message
[1:31:19] i don't have to do that i just let the
[1:31:21] message live out to me
[1:31:22] you know what i don't have to defend
[1:31:24] brother branham
[1:31:25] i don't have to defend the message all i
[1:31:28] got to do is let it live through
[1:31:30] me and let people see the life of what
[1:31:32] he preached
[1:31:33] what the word produces in our life they
[1:31:36] see christ
[1:31:38] that's it right there
[1:31:41] [Music]
[1:31:42] can we get a lot of hand
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:55] i'm closing i hope
[1:31:58] i want you to catch what i said i didn't
[1:32:01] say i'm fizzing the clothes
[1:32:03] i said i'm closing
[1:32:06] because when you say clothes then you
[1:32:08] keep going the enemy comes i thought he
[1:32:10] said he finally quit
[1:32:12] the game keep on going so i'm closing
[1:32:15] that mean we're getting there
[1:32:21] i am closing though see brothers and
[1:32:24] sisters
[1:32:26] all these little things that come in
[1:32:28] your life peter said think it not
[1:32:30] strange
[1:32:31] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[1:32:34] try you
[1:32:35] as though some strange thing happened
[1:32:40] it's not strange god is permitting it
[1:32:45] i don't care how perfect you think you
[1:32:47] don't got
[1:32:48] it still ain't going to change trials
[1:32:50] god testified
[1:32:52] his own mouth job was perfect
[1:32:56] but it didn't stop job trial
[1:33:00] because god is constantly working on
[1:33:04] us and you know what
[1:33:07] when he the more he works on us the more
[1:33:09] we humble ourselves
[1:33:10] the more our children see they begin to
[1:33:13] see that even in our lives
[1:33:16] oh i can really get into something now i
[1:33:17] can just give you so many examples of
[1:33:19] things of family life
[1:33:21] you know brother chad they say i preach
[1:33:22] on family too much too
[1:33:24] but i love it
[1:33:27] because that's important family life
[1:33:30] is important and most people that say
[1:33:34] that their families all tore up cause
[1:33:36] they don't want to hear it
[1:33:37] one thing about this message it corrects
[1:33:39] a man it corrects a woman
[1:33:41] it corrects a child it corrects a church
[1:33:44] it corrects the ministry
[1:33:45] it corrects everything that's what this
[1:33:49] message is done
[1:33:51] a perfect message to create a perfect
[1:33:53] people or have a perfect bride
[1:33:56] for a perfect rapture this word will do
[1:33:58] that for this
[1:34:01] i'm just being honest with you and i'll
[1:34:03] be honest with you i'm actually being
[1:34:05] honest now i really feel like preaching

[1:34:11] that's been said i want it to stick
[1:34:13] yes you young man be gentlemen

[1:34:23] i'm so shocked i honestly thought
[1:34:26] everybody in the message preached

[1:34:34] some young people don't even know what

[1:34:38] don't even know how to approach it
[1:34:41] that's right but i'ma just tell you like
[1:34:43] this
[1:34:44] young man or young girl if you want to
[1:34:47] if you want to learn anything from burly

[1:34:55] an overcoming life by yourself with
[1:34:58] christ
[1:34:59] marriage is not going to help you
[1:35:02] [Applause]
[1:35:04] it's not going to help you you got to be
[1:35:06] able to live with him
[1:35:08] first and overcome your youthfulness
[1:35:12] before you enter into a relationship
[1:35:15] i'm just being honest with you don't get
[1:35:18] anxious

[1:36:03] alone i said adam was lonely
[1:36:06] but he was not lonely for sex
[1:36:12] because it wasn't in his vocabulary

[1:36:20] married oh

[1:37:24] want to date
[1:37:24] they don't want courtship they want a
[1:37:26] date you see
[1:37:28] date is hidden courtship is open
[1:37:32] you know courtship is open where
[1:37:35] everybody know
[1:37:37] it's a beautiful thing when the pastor
[1:37:40] the parents don't talk to the pastor and
[1:37:42] saying about this young man and then the
[1:37:44] pastor talked
[1:37:44] and then the pastor say church i just
[1:37:46] want you to let you know
[1:37:48] we need to be praying for brothers and
[1:37:49] sisters so and so during a courtship now
[1:37:51] praying for the will of god is this is
[1:37:54] so
[1:37:54] openly amen now when you see churches
[1:37:58] over you see them talking to each other
[1:37:59] people like
[1:38:03] see when it's open now you say oh yeah

[1:38:18] it's two families coming together that's
[1:38:21] gonna cheer
[1:38:22] grandchildren that's right
[1:38:26] oh the beauty of courtship oh first chad
[1:38:28] i feel like preaching
[1:38:29] but i'm done musicians could come
[1:38:34] god bless you may god can we give god a
[1:38:37] big hand
[1:38:47] can we bow our hearts
[1:38:58] see anybody have need of prayer even
[1:39:00] though i know it's a little late but
[1:39:03] the altar is open
[1:39:07] but what i have noticed myself the lord
[1:39:10] had really helped me in my ministry
[1:39:13] sometimes it don't mean all the call
[1:39:15] because people sit right in their
[1:39:17] seat and they be dealing god be dealing
[1:39:21] with them
[1:39:22] and they respond
[1:39:26] father i'm thankful tonight
[1:39:30] i'm thankful for your word
[1:39:33] i'm thankful for your presence
[1:39:36] these things are so simple lord
[1:39:39] but it brings so much power and
[1:39:42] character in our lives
[1:39:44] when we understand that we're just clay
[1:39:49] you're the potter we're the clay
[1:39:52] and you know what you want us to be it's
[1:39:54] not what we want to be it's what you
[1:39:56] want us to be
[1:39:58] you know i just pray tonight i'm sure if
[1:40:01] i was the axis
[1:40:03] if god spoke to your heart raise your
[1:40:05] hand i'm sure oh god many hands will go
[1:40:07] up
[1:40:08] i'm sure of that but father i just want
[1:40:12] to pray for each and every one of us
[1:40:13] lord
[1:40:15] sometimes we just need a rededication in
[1:40:17] our lives
[1:40:19] from the pressures and things of the day
[1:40:21] month through the months weeks two weeks
[1:40:23] day by day depression and stress causes
[1:40:26] us to react sometimes some way we
[1:40:27] shouldn't
[1:40:29] that's why the prophet god preached a
[1:40:30] message letting off the pressure
[1:40:32] we have to know how to let off this
[1:40:34] pressure but lord you're doing things so
[1:40:36] simple
[1:40:38] you're mowing and working on us just
[1:40:40] like when the statue
[1:40:43] was moses was being built in the
[1:40:46] beginning
[1:40:47] i'm sure it was a lot of dust a lot of
[1:40:49] chunks
[1:40:50] a lot of noise a lot of hammering but
[1:40:53] the more and
[1:40:53] more he got closer to the finishing of
[1:40:56] the image
[1:40:57] it got quieter it got quieter
[1:41:01] and it came to a place of just sandpaper
[1:41:04] a little small
[1:41:05] sandpaper quieter quieter quieter
[1:41:09] because it seemed like the closer we get
[1:41:12] to the image the quieter things get
[1:41:15] because god you're working on the
[1:41:16] masterpiece you're working on your bride
[1:41:20] i just pray father that you would bless
[1:41:23] your people tonight i know you have in
[1:41:24] your word
[1:41:25] and i actually feel touch strength in my
[1:41:27] body
[1:41:28] touch my father-in-law be with my wife
[1:41:32] comfort her heart lord the things that
[1:41:34] she have to deal with
[1:41:36] and i pray for every individual here
[1:41:38] that might even be in the crossroad
[1:41:40] got a lot of things upon their mind
[1:41:42] questions
[1:41:43] i pray for them tonight lord that they
[1:41:45] were just trusting you
[1:41:47] and be patient for the answers to come
[1:41:50] not try to make knowing up
[1:41:51] but the answers will come oh god i thank
[1:41:54] you for your grace and mercy
[1:41:56] and we commit everything into thy hands
[1:41:59] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:12] amen
[1:42:19] lord let's all stand amen
[1:42:23] i appreciate god bringing our focus back
[1:42:26] to the little things
[1:42:28] you know we can be chasing after big
[1:42:30] things so much we're trampling over
[1:42:31] little things
[1:42:32] and we can be in little things in our
[1:42:34] life displeasing the lord all the time
[1:42:37] but you know what i don't want to
[1:42:38] displease the lord with anything
[1:42:40] with a word i spoke with a reaction to
[1:42:42] an incident i want to be pleasing to him
[1:42:46] amen and if he's allowing irritations to
[1:42:48] come
[1:42:49] maybe the irritation is just putting me
[1:42:51] in position or just
[1:42:52] moving something out of my life that's
[1:42:54] got to go and instead of getting
[1:42:56] irritated
[1:42:57] i want to change my attitude how many
[1:42:58] want to change your attitude
[1:43:00] i want to say god i surrender to this
[1:43:04] irritation
[1:43:06] just do what you're going to do in my
[1:43:07] life just mold me and make me
[1:43:09] change me god and then i i was
[1:43:12] i was today i took brother yatzik
[1:43:16] just comes to my mind i took brother
[1:43:17] yatzik and brother nathan
[1:43:19] to the air force museum down in dayton i
[1:43:21] want him to see that little pigeon that
[1:43:23] brother venom talked
[1:43:24] about they've got that same one he spoke
[1:43:26] about on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:43:27] is there in the case
[1:43:29] but when we got to the world war ii
[1:43:31] section i looked at the
[1:43:33] bombing of pearl harbor and i
[1:43:37] and i realized that famous quote from
[1:43:40] that japanese man
[1:43:41] when they bombed pearl harbor they
[1:43:43] thought they had crippled the
[1:43:45] the us navy and and he told them he had
[1:43:48] spent some time in the states had gone
[1:43:49] to school there or whatever
[1:43:51] he knew the american culture a little
[1:43:52] bit and he had seen the states
[1:43:54] and he says you've not done anything all
[1:43:56] you've done is wake a sleeping giant
[1:44:00] and you know before they bombed pearl
[1:44:02] harbor before they were success there
[1:44:03] was
[1:44:03] all kinds of little things that was
[1:44:05] missed a little warning here
[1:44:07] missed a little thing here was missed
[1:44:09] and a little something
[1:44:11] and it looks like a lot of people made a
[1:44:12] lot of mistakes
[1:44:14] you know what god's in it all right a
[1:44:17] lot of little mistakes a lot of somebody
[1:44:18] not on their post of duty
[1:44:20] somebody missed something amen but at
[1:44:22] the end of the day that looked like the
[1:44:24] devil had a great
[1:44:25] a great attack it looked like the devil
[1:44:27] did something
[1:44:29] but all he did was wake a sleeping giant
[1:44:32] and sometimes when trials comes in our
[1:44:34] life with a little mistake here and
[1:44:36] somebody said a little something here or
[1:44:38] we missed a little something there
[1:44:40] and all of a sudden everything comes
[1:44:41] crashing down and a big trial
[1:44:43] and it looks like something huge has
[1:44:44] happened in our life
[1:44:46] really all god's trying to do is wake up
[1:44:48] the sleeping giant
[1:44:50] because he wants his bride to have his
[1:44:52] characteristics on
[1:44:53] display not just to have his
[1:44:55] characteristics we have to have his
[1:44:57] characteristics
[1:44:58] but he wants them on display
[1:45:01] amen and he wants us to overcome and be
[1:45:03] overcomers and
[1:45:04] all of these things are ordained of god
[1:45:06] you believe that
[1:45:07] the footsteps of the righteous are order
[1:45:09] of the lord can you say like
[1:45:11] at the end of the day can you say like
[1:45:12] joseph said i'm in the place of god
[1:45:16] god has put me here you didn't do it god
[1:45:18] did it
[1:45:20] amen i want to look at life differently
[1:45:23] i say god keep dialing me into your
[1:45:26] program
[1:45:27] not my program your program and we got a
[1:45:30] good dose of that tonight
