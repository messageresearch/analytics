[0:00] But why did he come and restore the
[0:02] truth? Why do we need to know about
[0:04] serpent seed? Because if you don't know
[0:06] about serpent seed, the open book of
[0:08] redemption doesn't mean anything to you
[0:09] because YOU DON'T KNOW WHY you're
[0:11] hybrid. You don't know what you were
[0:12] supposed to be. You don't know THAT YOU
[0:14] WERE SUPPOSED TO ALWAYS BE A MAN ON THE
[0:16] EARTH.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; You were not meant to be an angel. You
[0:20] were not meant TO BE A CHERUBAM. GOD
[0:22] NEVER INTENDED FOR YOU TO BE A HEAVENLY
[0:24] BEING. HE ALWAYS MEANT for you to be a
[0:26] man on THE EARTH, A GOD MAN, A GOD RACE
[0:29] living on the earth. And serpent SEED
[0:32] TELLS US WHAT WENT WRONG. IT'S NOT SO WE
[0:35] KNOW MORE THAN A BAPTIST OR NO MORE THAN
[0:37] THE CATHOLICS. IT'S SO THAT WE
[0:38] UNDERSTAND WHAT REDEMPTION IS ALL ABOUT.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE DOCTRINE OF THE GODHEAD FOR?
[0:43] IT'S NOT SO WE CAN SAY THE CATHOLIC
[0:45] CHURCH IS WRONG. MY GOODNESS, most
[0:47] everybody knows the Catholic CHURCH IS
[0:48] WRONG. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND GODHEAD SO
[0:51] WE KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT FAMILY WE'RE
[0:53] PART OF, WHERE WE CAME FROM, AND WHAT
[0:55] GOD IS ACTUALLY WANTING TO DO WITH US.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; WHO WE REALLY ARE.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; All of these truths that were restored,
[1:04] THEY WERE RESTORED FOR THE PURPOSE OF US
[1:07] UNDERSTANDING REDEMPTION, NOT SO THAT WE
[1:09] COULD HAVE A THEOLOGICAL DEGREE IN THE
[1:11] BIBLE.
[1:12] NOT SO THAT WE HAVE A PROPERLY SET UP
[1:14] CHURCH. NOT SO WE HAVE A HIGHER MORAL
[1:16] CODE. NOT SO THAT WE HAVE NICER LOOKING
[1:18] FAMILIES BY BY THE REVELATION OF THE
[1:21] WORD. WE'LL DO ALL OF THAT. BUT THAT'S
[1:23] NOT THE PURPOSE. THE PURPOSE IS SO OUR
[1:25] EYES WILL COME OPEN SO WE WILL KNOW WHAT
[1:28] WENT WRONG, WHO WE ARE, WHERE WE COME
[1:30] FROM, AND WHAT GOD IS TRYING TO DO.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT BUILDS
[1:38] FAITH. AMEN. TELLING YOU, YOU KNOW, WHEN
[1:40] YOU LOOKED APART AND YOU GO TO THE RIGHT
[1:42] CHURCH AND YOU GOT THE RIGHT PASTOR AND
[1:43] ALL THE DOCTRINES LINED UP, YOU'LL BE
[1:45] ACCEPTED BY GOD AND YOU'LL BE RIGHT.
[1:47] LISTEN, THAT IS THAT IS FRUITLESS.
[1:49] THAT'LL BRING NOTHING BUT misery and
[1:51] heartache cuz we'll NEVER GET IT RIGHT.
[1:53] BUT YOU GET THE REVELATION OF REDEMPTION
[1:55] AND YOU FIND OUT YOUR NAME WAS ON THE
[1:56] BOOK AND YOU WERE ALWAYS PART OF GOD'S
[1:58] PLAN AND GOD ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO BE A
[2:00] MAN. HE ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO BE IN FLESH
[2:02] AND HE WANTED YOU TO BE HIS FAMILY
[2:04] REPRESENTING HIM ON THE EARTH. THEN ALL
[2:06] OF A SUDDEN YOU TALK ABOUT FAITH THAT
[2:08] GIVES YOU OVERCOMING FAITH.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; NOW WHY AM I STRUGGLING SO MUCH? OH
[2:13] BECAUSE OF THE FALL IN THE GARDEN OF
[2:14] EDEN. I'M IN HYBRID FLESH. I'M
[2:16] STRUGGLING NOT BECAUSE I'M NOT A SON OF
[2:18] GOD. NOT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE
[2:20] WORD. I'M STRUGGLING BECAUSE ADAM fell
[2:23] &gt;&gt; and now I can be a son of God and in a
[2:26] HYBRID BODY AT THE SAME TIME. YOU TALK
[2:29] ABOUT BUILDING FAITH. THIS RESTORED
[2:31] TRUTH BUILDS OUR FAITH.
[2:33] GIVES US FAITH TO BE THE sons of God.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Without it, we're jumping through hoops,
[2:39] religious hoops all the time.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; But this this revelation brings us into
[2:45] a rest. And when you come into a rest,
[2:49] &gt;&gt; guess what?
[2:51] &gt;&gt; When sheep rest, they bear wool.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; When they eat good food,
[2:56] &gt;&gt; drink good water, and rest under A
[2:59] SHEPHERD'S CARE, WHAT COMES OUT? WOOL.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; A HIGHER MORAL LIFE,
[3:06] &gt;&gt; A BETTER CONDUCT AMONGST PEOPLE,
[3:08] FAMILIES THAT ARE PUT. WHAT IS IT? IT'S
[3:10] THE NATURAL OUTCROPPING OF A REVELATION
[3:12] OF WHO YOU ARE and what THE WORD IS ALL
[3:15] ABOUT.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
