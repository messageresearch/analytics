[0:02] [Laughter]
[0:02] [Music]
[0:14] oh
[0:28] worship
[0:37] [Laughter]
[0:41] praise the lord amen
[0:45] such a pleasure to be with you this
[0:46] morning and i've enjoyed the worship and
[0:49] now it comes time to hear from him and
[0:52] we're excited to be here together while
[0:54] we're standing if you could just take
[0:55] your bibles and turn
[0:57] to john chapter 18 the gospel of john
[0:59] chapter 18.
[1:01] we'll just get started
[1:04] verse 37
[1:09] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[1:11] a king then
[1:12] jesus answered thou sayeth that i am a
[1:14] king
[1:15] to this end was i born and for this
[1:17] cause came i into the world
[1:19] that i should bear witness unto the
[1:20] truth every one that is of the truth
[1:23] heareth my voice so what was one of the
[1:27] purposes
[1:28] jesus came into the earth he tells you
[1:30] here he says to this end was i born
[1:32] and for this cause came i into the world
[1:35] that i should bear witness
[1:37] unto the truth says bow our heads
[1:40] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[1:42] for this opportunity lord
[1:44] that you've given us to gather together
[1:46] to worship your lord and
[1:48] we're here to receive your word we just
[1:50] ask now in jesus name lord that you
[1:52] would come down
[1:53] that you would break the bread of life
[1:54] with your own hand lord that it wouldn't
[1:56] be the working of a man
[1:57] but lord you would take these lips of
[1:59] clay and you would take
[2:00] my mind out of the way and all my ideas
[2:03] lord let me die to them now but
[2:05] i pray that by the power of your holy
[2:06] ghost you would pick up a gift that's
[2:08] laying in this vessel
[2:09] that you would use it lord to minister
[2:11] to your children lord to feed your sheep
[2:14] we come needy we come hungry we come
[2:16] because we want more of you lord
[2:17] i just pray that you'd give us a greater
[2:19] portion we ask in jesus christ's name
[2:23] amen you can be seated
[2:26] praise god
[2:29] so we find out jesus here standing
[2:32] before pilate
[2:34] and he says pilate asked him were you a
[2:36] king and he says
[2:38] thou sayest that i am a king but he's
[2:40] going to tell him his purpose amen his
[2:42] purpose for coming
[2:44] this end was i born you know we we're at
[2:46] the time when
[2:47] this is the season that everybody talks
[2:49] about the birth of jesus christ you know
[2:51] at the christmas time and
[2:52] brother branham we know he set that
[2:54] straight and he told us all things
[2:56] that we need to know but yet this is the
[2:58] season that everybody chooses to talk
[3:00] about this
[3:01] but when jesus when jesus was talking
[3:03] about it he was giving the purpose for
[3:05] his birth amen
[3:07] to this end was i born and for this
[3:09] cause came i enter the world
[3:11] amen that i should bear witness unto the
[3:14] truth amen
[3:15] so what did he come for to bear witness
[3:17] unto the truth
[3:19] and everyone that is of the truth
[3:21] heareth
[3:22] my voice praise god
[3:25] let's look over at john chapter 12. let
[3:27] me just go back
[3:29] a couple chapters to john chapter 12
[3:33] verse 46
[3:38] in john chapter 12 46 he says i am come
[3:41] a light unto the world that whosoever
[3:44] believeth on me
[3:45] should not abide in darkness
[3:48] so he come a light into the world amen
[3:50] and that was his purpose for coming
[3:52] we see here in christ is the mystery of
[3:54] god revealed i'm going to read several
[3:56] quotes out of this message crisis
[3:58] mystery god revealed and
[3:59] i've just been been reading in it and
[4:01] enjoying it very much and i'm going
[4:03] very slowly through this this book and
[4:06] i'm enjoying it very much so you might
[4:07] hear a lot about it coming up
[4:09] because it's really been inspiring to me
[4:11] but i want to minister on search the
[4:13] scriptures
[4:14] they are they which testify of me as a
[4:17] subject i want to take
[4:18] search the scriptures they are they that
[4:21] testify of me
[4:22] and when we hear that our mind always
[4:24] goes to a certain place
[4:26] and jesus is talking and we'll get to
[4:27] that in a minute but but i think that
[4:29] could be applied today to you and i
[4:31] amen i believe the same statement could
[4:33] be applied today
[4:34] to you and i brother bam says in christ
[4:37] is the mystery of god revealed
[4:39] now god had a purpose in a hidden
[4:41] mystery
[4:42] and that's what i want to speak on to
[4:43] the church this morning the hidden
[4:45] mystery of god
[4:46] that he had in his mind before the world
[4:48] ever began and how that it's unfolded
[4:50] itself right down to this present hour
[4:52] that we're living see
[4:53] then you will understand clearly then
[4:56] you see on believe on what is being done
[4:59] amen so we know that christ is the
[5:01] mystery of god revealed brother ben was
[5:02] talking about the threefold purpose that
[5:03] was in the back
[5:04] part of god's mind and here we have a
[5:06] prophet of god on the scene
[5:08] that is going to reach back into the
[5:09] back part of god's mind
[5:11] and he's going to begin to talk about
[5:12] things that have been laying there from
[5:14] before the foundation of the world that
[5:16] nobody's been able to talk about before
[5:18] and he says he's had a purpose amen an
[5:21] idea
[5:22] something that he was trying to
[5:23] accomplish amen and he's going to do it
[5:25] in a three-fold manner amen the first
[5:27] fold to get preeminence
[5:28] in a man and he did that in christ jesus
[5:31] but the second fold is to get
[5:32] preeminence in a people
[5:34] and the bride and then third is to
[5:35] restore them back into perfect
[5:37] fellowship
[5:38] back into an eaten condition and so this
[5:40] has been his plan
[5:42] all the way through this is his plan
[5:44] through the entire bible
[5:45] this is his plan before he wrote the
[5:47] bible when he throw the stars out this
[5:49] was his plan
[5:50] when enoch built the then he built the
[5:52] pyramid this was the plan
[5:53] when he had the prophets begin to
[5:55] prophesy and record down the prophecies
[5:58] this has always been his plan this is
[6:00] what he's been working on
[6:01] since before the foundation of the world
[6:05] hallelujah praise the lord
[6:11] see it's unfolded itself right down to
[6:14] this present hour that we're living
[6:17] then you understand clearly then you
[6:18] will see i believe in what is being done
[6:21] god's great great mystery of how it's a
[6:23] secret he kept it a secret
[6:25] nobody knows nothing about it even the
[6:27] angels didn't understand it
[6:28] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[6:31] under our seventh mystery
[6:32] when the seventh seal was opened there
[6:34] was silence jesus when he was on earth
[6:36] they wanted to know when he would come
[6:38] he said it's not
[6:39] even the son himself don't know when
[6:41] it's going to happen see
[6:42] god has this all to himself it's a
[6:45] secret
[6:45] and that's the reason there was silence
[6:47] in heaven for the space of a half hour
[6:49] and seven thunders uttered their voices
[6:51] and john was even forbidden to write it
[6:54] see the coming of the lord that's one
[6:56] thing he hasn't revealed yet
[6:58] of how he will come and when he will
[7:00] come it's a good thing that he doesn't
[7:02] no he has showed
[7:05] or revealed it in every type that's in
[7:08] the bible
[7:10] so yeah he he hasn't said it right out
[7:13] amen when brother bram comes to the
[7:14] third pool
[7:15] he's told don't say anything about this
[7:17] you explain the first one you explain
[7:18] the second one you cause the mess you
[7:20] cause interpretation
[7:21] don't say anything when you come to the
[7:23] seventh seal there's silence
[7:24] brother man comes to the seventh seal
[7:26] and he gets to the end he says now i
[7:28] said
[7:28] so i stop right there i feel to stop i
[7:30] wrote in here stop right here
[7:32] go no further he's told not to explain
[7:35] it
[7:36] but now he's coming along and christ is
[7:37] in the mystery garden review and it says
[7:39] he hasn't he says he hasn't
[7:42] see what he says he hasn't revealed yet
[7:44] of how he will come and when he'll come
[7:46] it's a good thing that he doesn't
[7:47] no he has showed it or revealed it
[7:50] in every type that's in the bible
[7:54] so now brother branham he's he's going
[7:56] to come he's going to show us
[7:57] this great mystery amen this great
[7:59] mystery of the seventh seal
[8:00] it's been showed and typed in every type
[8:04] that's in the bible
[8:06] if you want to see it it's there it's in
[8:08] the bible
[8:09] amen it's already there
[8:13] therefore the entire bible is the
[8:15] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[8:19] the entire bible is an expression of one
[8:22] goal that god had
[8:23] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[8:25] entire bible
[8:26] and all the acts of the believers in the
[8:28] bible has been in time
[8:30] in expressing what god's great goal is
[8:32] and now
[8:33] in this last day he has revealed it
[8:37] and shows it
[8:41] praise god but it's not for everybody
[8:45] it's by revelation it's only to the
[8:48] predestinated
[8:49] it's not for the masses it's not for
[8:52] everybody
[8:53] it's not something that can be
[8:54] interpreted it's for those that will
[8:56] pass through the little room and go
[8:58] behind the veil
[8:59] amen brother branham he has the tent
[9:02] vision and then the tent vision
[9:03] he's told all that he tells it back in
[9:05] 1956
[9:06] all the way back in 56 he starts talking
[9:08] about this great
[9:09] giant tent or cathedral and inside a
[9:12] little wooden room
[9:13] amen and he and he's told that this will
[9:16] be your third pool
[9:18] this will be the third pole and in there
[9:21] there's people that they're lined up and
[9:23] and and it's amazing they're coming in
[9:26] one by one
[9:27] and he says i saw that light go down
[9:28] into that room amen i saw the light the
[9:31] pillar of fire
[9:32] christ himself go down into that room
[9:34] and brother said i went to move my feet
[9:36] and i couldn't go down there
[9:39] amen there was a little little room and
[9:41] in that little room was christ a pillar
[9:43] of fire
[9:44] and they were going in one by one and
[9:46] one by one they would go behind the veil
[9:49] amen and they would come in contact amen
[9:51] with that light
[9:52] and they would walk out totally changed
[9:54] different than the way they walked in
[9:56] they walked in and they were stretchers
[9:58] they come out pushing their stretchers
[9:59] on crutches carrying the crutches
[10:01] something changed when they passed
[10:03] through that little room
[10:04] they come out the other side and there
[10:06] was somebody there brother venom said
[10:08] writing things down
[10:09] and they asked him what happened and the
[10:10] people themselves could not explain
[10:13] what happened in that room all they know
[10:15] is something has changed
[10:18] i was afflicted before i'm whole now
[10:21] something
[10:22] has changed
[10:23] [Applause]
[10:25] it wasn't a public show nobody else
[10:28] could see what was happening
[10:29] the prophet of god himself could not see
[10:32] what was happening in that little room
[10:36] but as they passed one by one an
[10:38] individual affair
[10:41] an individual slipping in behind the
[10:44] veil
[10:44] amen and what is the new birth jesus
[10:47] christ
[10:47] personally revealed to you
[10:51] what was that light that pillar of fire
[10:53] jesus christ
[10:54] meeting them one by one and he's told
[10:57] that this vision this
[10:58] will be your third pool
[11:04] it's amazing he first talks about the
[11:07] first place i found him talking about it
[11:09] is
[11:10] january 1st new year's message in 1956.
[11:15] and he says there's a pointing forward
[11:17] this will be your third pool
[11:19] but then he comes to sabine canyon in
[11:22] january
[11:24] of 1963 seven
[11:27] years later you think god's not in
[11:31] control
[11:32] seven years later in january he's in
[11:34] subpoena can he's praying
[11:36] his hands are in the air and something
[11:37] strikes his hand and it's a sword
[11:39] and he hears a voice say it's the sword
[11:41] of the king
[11:43] we know all of that and he's looking at
[11:44] that and now that angel says
[11:47] this is your third pool
[11:51] no longer pointing to the future amen
[11:54] now what was shown you in the future is
[11:57] now coming into manifestation
[11:59] there's going to be the opening of the
[12:01] word and this
[12:02] is your third pool
[12:06] but it's an individual affair it's by
[12:09] revelation
[12:11] hallelujah
[12:15] he said i don't know if i finish this
[12:18] quote or not i'll just read it again
[12:22] in the last days he has revealed it and
[12:25] shows it
[12:26] and god's help well you'll see it right
[12:28] here this morning
[12:30] see what this great mystery the part
[12:33] that wasn't spoken
[12:34] amen the part's been kept quiet the
[12:36] secret the things the angels didn't know
[12:38] nothing about
[12:39] amen the thing that john was forbidden
[12:40] to write amen all of that
[12:43] with god's help you'll see it right here
[12:46] this morning
[12:47] hey if you're going to see it right here
[12:48] this morning it's only going to be by
[12:51] god's help amen
[12:52] it's not going to be by the the
[12:54] eloquence of a preacher it's not going
[12:55] to be by
[12:56] slides or charge amen it's not going to
[12:58] be by just straight teaching
[13:00] if you're going to ever catch this
[13:02] mystery it's going to be by the help of
[13:04] god
[13:06] [Applause]
[13:08] god's help we'll see you'll see it right
[13:11] here this morning
[13:12] and what the lord has had in his mind
[13:14] all along and has
[13:16] expressed it so he's been expressing it
[13:19] amen this isn't the first time he's
[13:21] expressing it
[13:22] he's been expressing it all the way down
[13:24] through so the entire
[13:26] bible is this expression
[13:30] therefore you can see the great meaning
[13:32] of what it has been to know this
[13:34] and then try to bring it to the people
[13:37] and and you know i haven't went into
[13:39] details to try to explain it as god has
[13:41] revealed it to me
[13:43] hallelujah that's why i love that
[13:46] message christ is the mystery god
[13:48] revealed
[13:49] means so much to me let's look in the
[13:51] gospel of john again at chapter 17.
[13:56] i just want to read something else
[13:59] you all know me by now and know how i
[14:01] work
[14:03] i'm slow and we go around the horn and
[14:07] we finally get to the path that we want
[14:08] to walk but just bear with me just pull
[14:11] the harder you pull the faster we get
[14:12] there amen
[14:14] so just pull john chapter 17 verse 4
[14:20] i have glorified thee on earth on the
[14:23] earth i have finished the work which
[14:24] thou gavest me to do
[14:26] and now o father glorify thou me with
[14:28] thine own self with the glory which i
[14:30] had with thee
[14:31] before the world was do you think jesus
[14:34] had any spiritual amnesia
[14:38] you think jesus was struggling with his
[14:40] origin where he came from
[14:42] what he was to do on the earth what his
[14:44] purpose he said i've glorified your name
[14:46] on the earth
[14:47] i did the work that you told me to do
[14:49] now glorify me with the glory i had with
[14:50] you before
[14:51] amen he's not under spiritual amnesia he
[14:54] knows exactly where he's at
[14:59] he says verse 6 i have manifest thy name
[15:01] unto the men which thou gavest me out of
[15:03] the world
[15:04] now where did these men come from amen i
[15:08] have manifested the name to the men that
[15:09] thou gave us to me amen it wasn't jesus
[15:12] walking along and saying you look like a
[15:13] pretty good fella i think you'll hold up
[15:16] under pressure
[15:16] i think i'm going to choose you no they
[15:18] were already given to him
[15:20] of the father he was going around
[15:22] collecting what was
[15:24] already belonged to the father and given
[15:26] to him of the father
[15:27] and he was just there led by the spirit
[15:30] to collect what the father had already
[15:32] given
[15:34] i manifest thy name unto the men which
[15:36] thou gavest me out of the world
[15:38] thine they were and thou gave us them me
[15:41] and they have kept thy word
[15:43] now they ha they have known that all
[15:45] things whatsoever thou has given me
[15:47] are of thee for i have given unto them
[15:50] the words which thou gave us me
[15:51] and they have received them and have
[15:53] known surely that i come
[15:54] out from thee and they have believed
[15:57] that thou did send me
[15:59] i pray for them now let's let's look at
[16:01] verse 8 again because it's interesting
[16:04] he's saying i've given them
[16:07] thy words which thou gave us me and they
[16:10] received them
[16:11] and have known surely that i come out
[16:12] from thee it's amazing because the
[16:14] pharisees say where did you come from
[16:17] and the pharisees where did you get that
[16:19] but here here the disciples the ones
[16:22] that the father given to him
[16:23] they knew he came out from them and they
[16:26] knew
[16:26] he was speaking the words the father
[16:28] gave them but the well-trained pharisees
[16:31] they were asking where did you get that
[16:33] and where did you come from
[16:34] and who do you belong to and what's your
[16:36] origin but here
[16:38] these fishermen and tax collectors and
[16:40] whatever else they were
[16:41] they knew where he came from and they
[16:43] knew where his words came from
[16:46] it was it wasn't an intellectual thing
[16:49] it was by spiritual revelation
[16:51] they were already predisposed to believe
[16:54] they already had
[16:55] something in their spiritual dna amen
[16:58] that the word of god could unlock and it
[17:00] come to life and they would say
[17:01] thou are the son of the living god
[17:04] they're a christ the son of the living
[17:05] god
[17:05] where did that come from my father told
[17:08] that to thee
[17:09] [Applause]
[17:11] they were already by predestination amen
[17:14] they were already
[17:14] wired to believe it was we say it that
[17:16] way they already
[17:18] amen they already had the ability within
[17:21] them to believe
[17:22] because they were the fathers the father
[17:24] gave them to them and he says they know
[17:26] that what i'm saying comes from you and
[17:28] they know that i come from you
[17:31] how did they know that the same way you
[17:34] know that this is nothing but the truth
[17:36] when you listen to the message amen
[17:38] and you hear what the prophet saying and
[17:40] you read christ as the mystery of god
[17:41] revealed you've got the same wiring on
[17:43] the inside
[17:44] that same spiritual dna amen as it
[17:47] begins to unfold
[17:48] something and you say that's true that's
[17:50] true that's true
[17:52] how do you know it's true because i know
[17:54] it's true
[17:56] based off what i have nothing to base it
[17:59] off of
[18:02] hallelujah you say he based it off the
[18:06] word
[18:06] but if i get into a theological debate
[18:08] over the things that brother branham
[18:10] brought amen and i start to talk with a
[18:12] theologian
[18:12] he's going to make me feel stupid and
[18:14] foolish and like i don't know nothing
[18:16] in about 50 15 or 20 minutes
[18:20] he'll start breaking down greek and this
[18:22] word here and exit jesus this
[18:24] and whatever else he wants to talk about
[18:26] amen because it's not
[18:28] that kind of understanding it's not that
[18:30] kind of knowing
[18:31] amen it's something that's much higher
[18:33] than an intellectual knowing
[18:35] it's something that is already wired in
[18:38] the soul
[18:38] in the seed gene of god that came from
[18:41] god that's going back to god
[18:43] amen that recognizes anything that comes
[18:45] from god
[18:46] that which also came from god can
[18:48] recognize its origin
[18:50] that's god somebody else will say
[18:53] amen that's heresy no that's god
[18:58] that's a false prophet no that's god
[19:03] those are a bunch of fanatics no that's
[19:05] god
[19:08] prove it don't have to
[19:14] hallelujah amen
[19:17] where are we at verse 8 verse 9 i pray
[19:20] for them i pray not for the world but
[19:22] for them which thou has given me
[19:24] for they are thine
[19:28] and all mine are thine and thine are
[19:30] mine and i am glorified
[19:32] in them and now i am no more in the
[19:36] world
[19:37] what
[19:41] jesus says some amazing things
[19:45] he's right here with the disciples
[19:50] on the earth praying a prayer
[19:54] and he's saying he's saying i
[19:57] now and now i am no more
[20:01] in the world
[20:08] jesus does this all the time
[20:11] he talks to nicodemus and he
[20:14] begins to talk to nicodemus and he said
[20:17] to nicodemus he said the son of man
[20:19] which is in heaven
[20:22] and here jesus he's been calling himself
[20:25] the son of man
[20:26] he's been referring to himself as son of
[20:29] man but here he's talking to nicodemus
[20:31] and he says now the son of man which is
[20:34] in heaven and now
[20:38] nicodemus could go now amen after jesus
[20:41] his death and he buried he resurrected
[20:44] and now somebody starts talking to him
[20:46] about the son of man ministry and that
[20:48] son of man ministry and it was in that
[20:49] man and nicodemus says
[20:52] i heard him say the son of man was
[20:55] in heaven so that couldn't have been the
[20:57] son of man
[21:02] just take jesus's words he said the son
[21:04] of man which is in heaven
[21:06] nicodemus heard that nicodemus may have
[21:08] had a recording he may have went down
[21:10] and wrote it down
[21:11] and now he could discredit the flesh
[21:13] ministry of jesus christ
[21:14] because he himself said the son of man
[21:17] was in heaven
[21:19] because the son of man was in heaven and
[21:22] the son of man was standing there
[21:23] talking to him on earth
[21:24] amen heaven is not far away heaven's all
[21:27] around
[21:28] it's just moving at a faster dimension
[21:30] amen we
[21:31] are right now seated in heavenly places
[21:34] in christ jesus amen we get the idea
[21:38] that it's impossible to be in two
[21:40] dimensions at the same time
[21:41] where does the scripture ever say that
[21:45] it's not there in fact jesus makes it
[21:48] clear
[21:48] you can be in two dimensions at the same
[21:50] time paul makes it clear
[21:52] you could be seated in heavenly places
[21:54] in christ jesus
[21:57] that's why he he looks at his disciples
[21:59] jesus says and he says follow after me
[22:01] that where i am ye may be
[22:04] also not future tense present tense
[22:08] if you're following after him where he
[22:10] is you may be also
[22:13] where is he amen in heavenly places
[22:15] where am i
[22:16] in heavenly places
[22:19] [Applause]
[22:20] hey my body's still in this dimension
[22:22] i'm still standing here
[22:24] i'm not denying that any more than jesus
[22:26] denied that he was the son of man
[22:28] in a body of flesh but he was also the
[22:30] son of man
[22:31] in heaven at the same time
[22:33] [Applause]
[22:36] amen the message came to get us out of
[22:39] kindergarten
[22:41] an earthly intellectual understanding
[22:44] that he can only be here
[22:45] and then he can be here and he's got to
[22:47] move from here to here
[22:48] hey he can be here and here at the exact
[22:52] same time
[22:56] if not the bible doesn't mean anything
[22:59] and jesus
[23:00] doesn't even have common understanding
[23:03] if that can't be true
[23:06] hallelujah it's fundamental that we
[23:10] erase everything science has taught us
[23:14] when we want to understand spiritual
[23:16] things
[23:17] because it doesn't follow the rules of
[23:19] science
[23:21] jesus was not speaking in intellectual
[23:23] terms that could be easily understood
[23:25] when he looked at them and said unless
[23:27] you eat my flesh and drink my blood
[23:30] you have no life in you amen that wasn't
[23:32] intellectually easy to understand
[23:35] and what he was saying was exactly the
[23:37] truth but it wasn't what they
[23:38] thought he was saying
[23:41] hallelujah amen
[23:45] god is good all right let's go back to
[23:49] our scripture
[23:53] amen verse 11 and now and now now
[23:57] i am no more in the world can you
[24:01] imagine the disciples with their heads
[24:02] about listen to jesus pray and they're
[24:04] like
[24:04] what
[24:09] it's like nicodemus he had heard him say
[24:12] things about the son of man but
[24:13] now nicodemus he's got some questions on
[24:16] his heart
[24:16] he wants some answers so he comes by
[24:18] night to jesus to have his questions
[24:20] answers
[24:21] and jesus doesn't answer questions jesus
[24:23] starts talking in mysteries
[24:25] lest the man be born again he said can a
[24:28] man go the second time into his mother's
[24:29] womb hey jesus isn't about explaining
[24:32] anything he says you're a master you're
[24:34] a master in israel you don't know these
[24:36] things
[24:37] what do you mean know these things
[24:39] you're talking about something i've
[24:40] never heard about that i must be born
[24:42] again
[24:43] amen that wasn't a term that was thrown
[24:44] out among the jews that wasn't something
[24:46] that they could turn to their scriptures
[24:48] and see that phrase used amen jesus is
[24:50] now saying
[24:51] you must be born again and nicodemus is
[24:54] stuck an intellectual he's stuck in
[24:56] human
[24:56] and he's saying how can i enter into my
[24:59] mother's womb a second time
[25:00] and jesus doesn't say well let me
[25:02] explain it to you it's spiritual
[25:04] no he says how you being a master how
[25:06] can you not know this
[25:11] it doesn't come by much study nicodemus
[25:13] could have never studied to the point to
[25:15] know that
[25:16] it comes by spiritual revelation
[25:20] the same thing that hit peter who was
[25:22] ignorant and unlearned
[25:23] amen and couldn't sign his own name but
[25:25] he could catch what the pharisees were
[25:27] missing
[25:29] it wasn't by learning amen it was by a
[25:31] spiritual revelation
[25:33] all of a sudden he said thou art christ
[25:35] the son of the living god
[25:38] flesh and blood had not told this to
[25:41] thee
[25:42] but my father which is in heaven
[25:47] when did the father tell him that
[25:51] that's what we don't have any record of
[25:52] in the scripture
[25:54] when did the father tell peter that
[25:59] maybe before the foundation of the world
[26:02] maybe he had that knowledge
[26:04] already in the seed maybe that
[26:07] revelation that knowledge that
[26:09] understanding was there when that
[26:12] attribute was with god
[26:13] when god was alone with his thoughts
[26:15] that's where the attribute that was in
[26:16] peter was abiding amen
[26:18] and maybe there is where he caught the
[26:21] revelation
[26:23] and now it's got to be manifest on the
[26:26] earth
[26:27] flesh and blood until my father which is
[26:29] in heaven has told you this
[26:32] how far away was heaven how did peter
[26:35] get there how did god come down
[26:38] we've got to get out of kindergarten
[26:40] we've got to get past first grade
[26:42] we've got to get up to where we have a
[26:43] spiritual understanding that all things
[26:45] are possible to them that believe
[26:51] praise god
[26:55] amen verse 11 and now i am no more in
[26:58] the world
[26:59] i wasn't supposed to stay this long on
[27:01] this god bless you all
[27:04] i got something really burning me up to
[27:06] get to so you better start pulling fast
[27:08] faster faster and now i am no more in
[27:11] the world but these are in the world and
[27:13] i come to the holy father
[27:15] keep through thine own name those whom
[27:18] thou has given me
[27:19] that they may be one as we are one as we
[27:22] are
[27:23] while i was with them in the world i
[27:24] kept them in thy name
[27:26] though those that thou gavest me i have
[27:28] kept and none of them as lost but the
[27:30] son of perdition that the scriptures
[27:32] might be fulfilled and now come i to
[27:35] thee
[27:35] and these things i speak in the world
[27:38] that they might have my joy fulfilled in
[27:40] themselves
[27:41] i have given them thy word and the world
[27:44] hath hated them
[27:45] because they are not of the world even
[27:47] as i
[27:48] am not of the world all right now
[27:52] he's drawing an equal sign
[27:55] just as he is not of the world is the
[27:59] same way in which they are not of the
[28:00] world
[28:05] let's read it again he says
[28:10] the world has hated them because they
[28:12] are not of the world
[28:13] even just like
[28:16] equal sign even as i am not of the world
[28:22] hallelujah brother branham he comes to
[28:24] communion the last message he's going to
[28:26] preach
[28:27] and in that message communion he starts
[28:29] talking about god
[28:30] pulling him and that little eagle and he
[28:32] says and then i realized
[28:33] i'm not the son of charles and ella
[28:36] branham
[28:37] i'm not what's he saying amen he's
[28:39] talking out of his head
[28:41] this isn't logical it doesn't make
[28:42] intellectual sense he's not speaking on
[28:45] the intellectual side
[28:46] he's saying i realized right then i am
[28:49] not the son
[28:50] of charles and ella branham
[28:52] [Applause]
[28:54] totally defying logic totally defying
[28:57] reason amen
[28:58] i am a son of god amen i come from god
[29:01] my origin wasn't through the womb of
[29:03] that woman it wasn't from the seed of
[29:05] that man
[29:06] it goes way back before that amen this
[29:09] is
[29:09] only my earthly coming
[29:13] but it's not who i am i'm not identified
[29:17] by the names on my birth certificate
[29:19] amen i am identified
[29:20] with the marriage certificate and my
[29:22] marriage certificate has a name on it
[29:25] and that marriage certificate is the
[29:26] lamb's book of life
[29:27] amen that will open in this day so that
[29:29] i could hear the mysteries
[29:31] and hear my name and know that i'm on
[29:33] that marriage certificate
[29:35] that goes back before the foundation of
[29:37] the world
[29:39] so just as jesus was not of the world we
[29:42] are not of the world
[29:44] amen hallelujah
[29:51] amen verse 15 i pray not that thou
[29:53] should just take them out of the world
[29:55] but that thou should keep should us keep
[29:57] them from the evil
[29:59] they are not of the world even as i
[30:03] am not of the world i'm not of the world
[30:06] either
[30:09] i'm in the world but i'm not of the
[30:11] world
[30:13] amen this body was formed they meant out
[30:16] of elements of the dust they met
[30:17] when when when genetic material got
[30:19] together and man
[30:20] and formed a cell and then mama kept
[30:22] eating and kept forming my body
[30:24] and i was born and i kept eating this
[30:26] body has come from the earth but this
[30:28] body is not who i
[30:29] am this is a temple a tabernacle a tent
[30:32] that i'm dwelling in
[30:33] i come from god and i'm going back to
[30:36] god
[30:37] i am not of the world even as jesus
[30:39] christ was not of the world
[30:43] amen praise god
[30:47] hallelujah amen
[30:51] they are not of the world even as i am
[30:53] not of the world sanctify them through
[30:55] thy truth
[30:57] thy word is truth as thou has sent me
[31:00] into the world even so have i
[31:02] sent them into the world and for their
[31:05] sakes i sanctify myself that they also
[31:08] might be sanctified
[31:09] through the truth brother iran comes and
[31:12] says in christ is the mystery god
[31:14] revealed paragraph 4 54 says and watch
[31:17] here
[31:19] here it's beautiful i don't want you to
[31:21] miss this now everybody and you people
[31:23] on tape out in the jungles and wherever
[31:25] you hear it now listen
[31:26] and as the father has sent me so send i
[31:29] you jesus said now watch
[31:31] the father that sent him went in him to
[31:34] vindicate himself right
[31:36] for he was the word and the same jesus
[31:38] that sends you goes
[31:39] with you and in you
[31:42] to vindicate the same god as the father
[31:45] has sent me and i live by the father
[31:47] so i'll send you and you live by me what
[31:49] is he
[31:50] he's the word you live by the word
[31:56] turn to matthew the gospel of matthew
[32:02] chapter 5
[32:08] matthew chapter 5.
[32:16] and verse 14.
[32:23] matthew 5-14 ye are the light of the
[32:25] world and the city that is set on a hill
[32:27] cannot be hid
[32:28] neither do men light a candle and put it
[32:30] under a bushel but on a candlestick and
[32:32] it giveth light unto all that are in the
[32:34] house
[32:35] let your light so shine before men that
[32:37] they may see your good works and glorify
[32:39] your father
[32:40] which is in heaven and what's
[32:41] interesting about this is jesus said
[32:43] that he came into the world of light
[32:45] that men should not walk in darkness but
[32:48] now he in his physical form
[32:50] amen as the man christ jesus
[32:53] he's leaving the earth in that form amen
[32:56] and now
[32:57] there's going to be a transfer of the
[32:58] light
[33:00] now he says i come a light that men
[33:03] should not dwell in darkness
[33:05] but then he looks at the disciples and
[33:07] he says ye
[33:08] are the light of the world but i thought
[33:10] he said he was the light
[33:12] and the true light but then he says year
[33:15] the light
[33:16] amen because it's him in them that are
[33:18] the light
[33:19] amen they come from the same place amen
[33:21] they come from the same origin
[33:23] amen they come from the same father and
[33:25] now it's he
[33:26] pouring his life into them now they
[33:28] become the light amen
[33:30] and he says the light is not put under a
[33:31] bushel but set on a candlestick or on a
[33:33] hill
[33:34] for all the city to see and this is
[33:36] where vashti failed when we were talking
[33:38] wednesday night
[33:39] vashti was the bride he meant she was
[33:41] the wife of the king
[33:42] but vashti did not want to be put on
[33:45] display
[33:46] the king had had a banquet and he had
[33:49] gathered all the royals and he had
[33:50] gathered all the important people and it
[33:52] was time
[33:52] now for him to call forth his bride it
[33:55] was at the end of seven days
[33:56] so he sends seven chamberlain's amen at
[33:58] the end of seven days
[34:00] to go fetch the bride amen and she's
[34:02] living
[34:03] amen she's living in a palace
[34:07] she's comfortable rich and increased
[34:09] with goods and has need of nothing she's
[34:11] a laodicean woman
[34:14] and she's having a feast for the women
[34:17] [Music]
[34:18] she's content being with the other
[34:20] churches she's content
[34:22] being like the other churches because a
[34:24] church is always represented by a woman
[34:26] so she's here in the feast of the
[34:27] churches she's here with the other
[34:29] i'm just like the other churches i'm
[34:31] content with the other churches
[34:32] i don't want to be separated out from
[34:35] the feast of the women
[34:36] i don't want to be brought before the
[34:38] king to be put on display
[34:43] let your light so shine before men that
[34:46] they see your good works and glorify god
[34:48] we don't light a light and stick it
[34:49] under a bushel back we're not here to be
[34:51] like another church we're not here to be
[34:53] like the denominations
[34:54] but at the end of the seven days he sent
[34:57] seven chamberlain
[34:58] to call him out of the feast of women to
[35:00] call vashti to come
[35:02] out of the feast of women and come into
[35:04] the presence of the king
[35:05] to be put on display
[35:07] [Applause]
[35:08] he wanted them all to see her
[35:11] [Applause]
[35:14] hallelujah i'm so thankful
[35:18] amen though some may reject the call
[35:21] there was a little esther
[35:25] and esther was willing to be on display
[35:29] not for herself but for the king
[35:33] praise god this is where vashti failed
[35:37] to set that light where else is there
[35:39] light
[35:41] where else is there light he looked at
[35:44] him and
[35:44] ye are the light of the world amen when
[35:46] jesus amen when he ascends to the father
[35:49] where's light where is it is it in the
[35:51] jewish religion
[35:52] is it with the pharisees and the
[35:54] sadducees where where is the light
[35:56] amen they're walking in darkness he came
[35:58] as light coming into darkness
[36:00] they were already in darkness they were
[36:02] in a laodicean condition
[36:04] they were in the darkness the light had
[36:06] almost completely faded out
[36:07] so he comes as light and when he leaves
[36:09] he leaves them
[36:11] as the light and if they refuse to go on
[36:14] display
[36:14] if they refuse to get on the candlestick
[36:16] amen now
[36:18] where is everybody going to see
[36:21] but he's calling for one that says i'll
[36:23] stand on the candlestick
[36:24] and i'll tell the truth i'll say what's
[36:26] right i'll say what's wrong
[36:28] i'll give the revelation in this message
[36:30] if somebody wants to hear
[36:31] i'll tell them god sent a prophet in
[36:33] this day because this condition
[36:35] is dark amen laodicea has gone in
[36:37] complete total
[36:39] blackout a complete
[36:43] total blackout so come out over my
[36:47] people
[36:48] whose call is that the spirit and the
[36:50] bride saying come amen
[36:54] she's got to be on display
[36:57] it says in the message things that are
[37:00] to be
[37:00] in 1965 now the only way that you can be
[37:04] a son or daughter of god is because you
[37:05] have to
[37:06] have to have eternal life there's only
[37:08] one form of eternal life and that's
[37:10] god's life
[37:11] only one form of eternal life that was
[37:13] god there to be a son of god you had to
[37:15] be
[37:16] in him always the gene of your life
[37:19] the gene of your life spiritual life
[37:20] tonight was in god the father before
[37:23] there was even a molecule
[37:27] so how old are you how old are you
[37:29] brother jeremy
[37:31] don't say 42

[37:42] me
[37:43] they were looking right at him brother
[37:45] bam talks just like jesus doesn't he
[37:48] he's standing before the crowd he says
[37:50] you have never really
[37:51] seen me what are you talking about
[37:56] brother brown
[37:57] i'm looking right at you that's not what
[37:59] he's talking about
[38:00] he's talking about the real hymn amen
[38:02] that real predestinated sieging of god
[38:05] that him was that was meant to be him
[38:07] all along
[38:08] amen he's talking about that eternal
[38:10] life that's dwelling inside and he's
[38:12] looking right out of people
[38:13] amen the people have perfectly fine
[38:15] vision and he says you
[38:17] have never really seen me
[38:21] and he tells him he said he's talking to
[38:22] people who know his heritage you know
[38:24] his birth
[38:25] who know where he came from amen in
[38:27] communion and he's saying
[38:28] i'm not the son of charles and ella
[38:30] branham amen he's
[38:32] talking just like jesus christ
[38:35] just like the scriptures are written
[38:37] amen i'm not the son of my mom and dad
[38:40] i'm the son of god
[38:42] amen amen
[38:45] i don't count i don't count my years
[38:48] you can't count eternity
[38:51] [Applause]
[38:54] the gene of your life spiritual life
[38:55] tonight was in god the father before
[38:57] there was even a molecule
[38:58] and you are nothing
[39:02] first can you say you're nothing that's
[39:04] the way to start this quote
[39:06] i'm nothing i'm nothing
[39:10] then the next little word is really
[39:11] exciting but
[39:16] you're nothing but
[39:19] the manifestation of the gene of life
[39:22] that was in god as a son of god
[39:25] you're not a farmer you're not an
[39:26] engineer you're not an accountant amen
[39:28] you're not a housewife
[39:29] you're not any of that you're not a
[39:31] deacon you're not a pastor you're not
[39:33] you're nothing but the manifestation of
[39:35] the gene of life that was in god
[39:37] at the beginning as a son of god that's
[39:39] what you are
[39:40] not the son of charles and ella branham
[39:42] amen not the flesh body that you see
[39:44] that's not what you are that's why
[39:46] brother ma'am can say i'm not the son of
[39:48] charles allen bram you've never really
[39:50] ever seen me
[39:51] because he's caught this revelation
[39:56] jesus had the same one he knew where he
[39:59] came from
[40:00] he knew where he was going he says now
[40:04] now you're expressed after his word has
[40:08] come in you to light up this age

[40:21] whether it's pillar of fire whether it's
[40:24] lord jesus christ on earth whether it's
[40:26] the bride
[40:27] whatever form that he takes he's here to
[40:29] light up the earth when he would come
[40:31] and his disciples on the day of
[40:32] pentecost amen they were the light amen
[40:35] in the only light that was on the earth
[40:38] it wasn't their light it was his light
[40:40] in them
[40:43] whatever form he comes in he's the light
[40:45] of the world
[40:48] he's the word now you're expressed
[40:52] now you're expressed after his word has
[40:54] come in you to light up this
[40:56] age you are expressing god's life
[40:59] in you because you're a son or daughter
[41:02] of god therefore you get what i mean
[41:04] you are now made you're sitting in this
[41:06] church tonight because your duty
[41:08] is to express god to this nation and
[41:11] this people
[41:12] and this neighborhood where you
[41:13] associate
[41:16] wherever you are god knew that you would
[41:18] be here because you have to be one of
[41:20] his genes or his attributes
[41:21] you had to be if you if you ever if
[41:23] you've got eternal life
[41:25] then it always was eternal life and god
[41:27] before there was a foundation
[41:29] the world knew that you would be here
[41:31] and when the word or the water the
[41:33] washing of the water
[41:34] the word fell upon you it was expressing
[41:36] a being
[41:39] it wasn't expressing this flesh now
[41:42] under a moral more
[41:44] a moral conduct amen
[41:47] that washing of the water the word came
[41:48] amen amen
[41:50] the word came to wash away the old life
[41:53] and it came to express
[41:54] a being what being it came to express
[41:58] christ christ
[42:02] is the mystery of god revealed christ is
[42:04] the entire bible
[42:06] christ is the lamb's book of life christ
[42:09] amen it was
[42:09] christ and moses it was christ and noah
[42:12] it was christ and abraham it was christ
[42:15] all the way through
[42:17] and it's christ here today in the
[42:19] manifestation of his bride
[42:20] it's christ the mystery of god
[42:23] revealed
[42:24] [Applause]
[42:28] hallelujah
[42:30] be to god let's go to first john chapter
[42:34] three
[42:36] i'm still laying a foundation
[42:40] i love you guys i do because you know
[42:44] it takes a lot of patience and grace and
[42:47] love
[42:48] for you guys but i love you back for it
[42:54] first john chapter 3
[42:59] verse 8. he that committeth sin is of
[43:03] the devil
[43:04] we know sin is unbelief he that
[43:06] committeth sinners of the devil for the
[43:07] devil sinneth
[43:08] from the beginning
[43:12] is that right sin didn't start in the
[43:15] garden of eden
[43:16] so brother bram said sin started in
[43:19] heaven
[43:20] so the devil sinneth from the beginning
[43:24] for this purpose the son of god was
[43:28] manifest
[43:29] that he might destroy the works of the
[43:31] devil
[43:32] the devil said from the beginning
[43:34] because the devil would simply from
[43:36] beginning
[43:36] in the mind of god it would require the
[43:39] son of a son of god to be made manifest
[43:41] to destroy the works of the devil
[43:43] because he said from the beginning there
[43:45] was already a plan in the mind of god
[43:47] and because of that the son of man was
[43:49] expressed
[43:51] the son of god was expressed was
[43:53] manifest that he might destroy the works
[43:55] of the devil
[43:57] brotherhood says in the spoken word is
[43:59] the original seed from 1962
[44:01] now christ was manifested to destroy the
[44:03] works of the devil you believe that
[44:06] now i can't explain all this i'm just
[44:08] going to go through it just quickly now
[44:09] hit the high places so
[44:11] you won't stay too long hallelujah
[44:14] christ was manifested to destroy the
[44:16] works of the devil is that right
[44:18] you all believe that what was he god's
[44:21] word
[44:22] god's word he was the word made
[44:25] flesh you could say
[44:28] what was he you could say he was a man
[44:30] you could say he was a man from
[44:32] galilee or come on that he was but
[44:34] really what he was was the word
[44:37] the word made flesh that's really what
[44:40] he was
[44:43] you believe that what was he
[44:46] god's word which destroys the works of
[44:50] the hybrid the devil is that right
[44:52] he was done to do that he was born to be
[44:54] that to destroy the works of the devil
[44:57] now his body is to do the same
[45:00] why because it's the same life with the
[45:03] same commission
[45:04] and the same ministry brother branham
[45:06] said they're just husband and wife
[45:08] same everything same life same ministry
[45:10] same anything
[45:12] hallelujah
[45:16] his body is to do the same because the
[45:17] body is head and body is together
[45:20] that right if christ is the head was the
[45:22] word
[45:23] his body has to be the same thing as his
[45:26] head
[45:27] was so what's the body what's the bride
[45:30] the word made flesh
[45:35] what is the word made flesh here to do
[45:37] it's manifest to what destroy the works
[45:39] of the devil
[45:40] you're here to destroy the works of the
[45:42] devil amen
[45:44] what are the works of the devil amen to
[45:46] discredit god's word
[45:47] to destroy god's people how does he do
[45:49] it he does it by deception
[45:51] on the word by changing the word by
[45:54] compromising the word
[45:55] what did he do in the beginning with eve
[45:57] he got her to change one word
[45:59] amen and that's how he discredited god's
[46:01] word that's how he destroyed god's
[46:03] people
[46:04] and we're here amen the manifestation of
[46:07] the word of god for this day
[46:08] to destroy the works of the devil by not
[46:11] changing the word
[46:12] by not compromising on the word by not
[46:14] hybridizing with her own intellect
[46:16] hey guess what brother branham says some
[46:18] things that don't make sense to the
[46:19] intellect
[46:21] jesus christ may said things that don't
[46:23] make sense to the intellect
[46:25] amen but we're not here to make it make
[46:28] sense we're here to believe it
[46:30] and to manifest it to make it live
[46:33] and you don't have to comprehend an
[46:35] intellectual brain
[46:36] to make it live
[46:40] i don't know how faith in his word can
[46:42] cause cancer cells to die
[46:44] i don't know how faith in his word can
[46:46] make a border on a woman's neck
[46:48] fall at her feet and there's no scar
[46:50] there's fresh skin
[46:51] i mean it's not like there's a hole
[46:53] there how how intellectually explained
[46:55] to me
[46:56] get a medical doctor to tell me how in a
[46:58] prayer in an instant of time
[46:59] a quarter can fall at somebody's feet
[47:01] amen and there's not a scar
[47:02] they don't have to stitch skin up hey
[47:04] man they don't have to put anything on
[47:05] it you
[47:06] can't understand it but you can
[47:08] certainly believe it
[47:10] and watch it manifest and live in this
[47:12] life
[47:13] we're not looking for somebody that can
[47:16] make the message make sense
[47:17] we're looking for people who can believe
[47:19] it and make the message
[47:21] live live it
[47:24] not make it make sense live it
[47:26] [Music]
[47:29] you can have all the doctrine in the
[47:30] world right but if it doesn't translate
[47:31] into a life we miss the message
[47:34] when you say i understand sermon seed
[47:36] and i understand this and i got my
[47:37] scriptures lined
[47:38] up and i've got all my ducks and i've
[47:39] got all my bible studies and i've got
[47:41] everything
[47:41] tightly knit together on all the
[47:43] doctrines but if you can't make that
[47:45] word live in your life then we have
[47:48] missed the entire purpose of the message
[47:50] because it's a threefold plan not that
[47:52] she will understand serpenty
[47:54] not that she will understand the godhead
[47:56] that she will be the very
[47:58] manifestation of the very life of jesus
[48:01] christ
[48:01] on the earth that's the message
[48:07] not somewhere over the rainbow but
[48:10] right here in this age that we're living
[48:13] now
[48:15] that's why the word came that's what the
[48:17] opening of the word is all about
[48:18] that's why a great faith has been put
[48:21] into the church
[48:22] by what the revealing of the word
[48:26] to do what live his life
[48:29] on earth not a substitute life not life
[48:32] part two
[48:32] not jesus light
[48:36] but the very same life and full measure
[48:40] has been brought
[48:41] back to the earth again
[48:44] to be encapsulated and embodied in a
[48:48] people
[48:48] on this earth which is his body his
[48:51] headship which is the revealed word
[48:53] has come down to connect with his body
[48:55] which is the bride of jesus christ
[48:58] to do what amen to manifest the son of
[49:01] man again
[49:02] the son of man the very flesh
[49:05] manifestation of christ
[49:08] not in one man in a mini-membered bride
[49:12] that's the message
[49:16] well i understand this and i understand
[49:18] it and i want to argue with you on that
[49:19] don't argue with me just make it live
[49:21] just live it don't argue and live it
[49:25] who was arguing with jesus when he
[49:26] opened the blinded eyes who was arguing
[49:28] with him when he resurrected
[49:30] from the dead there was no more argument
[49:32] [Applause]
[49:34] they could disbelieve it but what are
[49:36] you going to argue with
[49:40] i was dead but now i'm alive forevermore
[49:44] just live it
[49:47] hallelujah
[49:51] let's go to romans chapter 16.
[49:57] brother branham's trying to show us that
[49:59] scripture
[50:01] we take this scripture in first john 3
[50:04] and
[50:04] and we read the scripture and we apply
[50:07] that to jesus christ and his earthly
[50:09] ministry
[50:10] is that correct and that's not wrong
[50:14] that's correct but brother brandon comes
[50:17] and he takes that same scripture
[50:19] and he doesn't leave it in brother
[50:21] branham's earthly ministry
[50:22] but he pulls it into the ministry of
[50:24] jesus christ in the bride
[50:26] today so that scripture has a compound
[50:30] revelation
[50:31] and a compound fulfillment
[50:35] who's it for christ who's supposed to
[50:38] fulfill it
[50:38] christ not just
[50:41] the man by the sea of galilee but christ
[50:45] in whatever form he comes in
[50:49] that scripture applies to christ
[50:52] so if christ comes in the formation of
[50:54] the bride that scripture
[50:56] applies to christ that's what brother
[50:58] branham is doing in the message
[51:00] he's taking that scripture which was for
[51:02] jesus christ the son of god
[51:04] god may manifest to destroy the works of
[51:05] the devil and he says now
[51:07] his body is to do the same thing
[51:10] whose body is it what's the body of the
[51:12] bride no who's body
[51:14] his body and it wasn't the prophet of
[51:18] god brother brahm told us that that was
[51:20] paul the apostle who told us it was his
[51:21] body
[51:23] not a separate body not a second body
[51:27] are we getting this his body
[51:33] his head did not come to a second body
[51:38] his head came to his body
[51:42] his body his head connected together
[51:46] what do you mean by the chad that body
[51:48] it's in heaven sitting
[51:51] my goodness do we not know the bible
[51:54] have we not read the scriptures
[51:57] search the scriptures they are they that
[52:00] testify of me
[52:02] when god made them in the beginning he
[52:04] made them male and female
[52:06] and called their name adam
[52:12] he called he made them male and female
[52:14] and called their
[52:15] name jesus christ
[52:18] male and female brother man said this
[52:20] seventh seal has been shown all the way
[52:22] back at the beginning in genesis
[52:25] where's the seventh seal in genesis it's
[52:27] all through genesis
[52:29] the genesis is full of the seventh seal
[52:31] all you gotta do is go reading and you
[52:33] see the seventh seal here the seventh
[52:34] seal here the seventh seal here
[52:36] you find the seventh seal and the
[52:37] threefold purpose of god wants to get
[52:39] preeminence in the man
[52:40] so he created a son and he put him in
[52:42] the flesh and he had his son adam upon
[52:44] the earth but it was
[52:46] not good that adam dwelled alone so he
[52:48] laid adam down and put adam to sleep and
[52:50] took out of his side
[52:51] the ingredients for a bride and he made
[52:54] a woman amen
[52:55] in the image of the man amen to reflect
[52:58] the characters that were in that man
[53:02] and what's inside of her was inside of
[53:04] him
[53:05] [Applause]
[53:08] and when god looks at that he doesn't
[53:11] see two
[53:13] he sees one but the carnal human mind
[53:18] sees two it's the carnal human mind that
[53:22] would see the bride of christ separate
[53:23] from christ
[53:25] the carnal human mind will see
[53:28] the bride of christ as something
[53:30] separate than christ she is
[53:32] him that's what the prophet told us she
[53:35] is him his body
[53:39] his body the body of jesus christ
[53:46] stop counting with your eyes stop
[53:47] looking say 1-2
[53:51] have spiritual eyes let's say 1-1
[53:54] christ in christ christ and male christ
[53:57] and female christ in christ it's all
[53:59] christ
[53:59] [Applause]
[54:01] amen hallelujah so brother bannon is now
[54:05] he does this all the time
[54:06] amen but sometimes when we're in message
[54:08] kindergarten or in message preschool
[54:10] we'll see brother branham do that and
[54:12] we'll just think like he's just making
[54:14] an analogy
[54:17] he just will see him do things with
[54:18] scriptures that make your mind just fall
[54:20] to pieces
[54:22] brother ben will take the scripture in a
[54:24] quote a certain way and you're like i
[54:25] i have no idea how how you could read
[54:28] that and say that
[54:30] have you ever been there just read the
[54:33] message some more you'll get there
[54:37] how he he's not relying on his
[54:42] intellect to interpret the scriptures
[54:46] he's relying on the leadership of the
[54:48] holy ghost
[54:50] and god is vindicating and backing it up
[54:53] that this is what the the man has it
[54:54] right
[54:56] and he's not leaving one scripture
[54:58] pigeonholed
[54:59] anywhere in the bible but brother
[55:01] branham does the same thing jesus christ
[55:02] does and does the same thing paul the
[55:04] apostle does
[55:05] they can go back in the old testament
[55:07] and they can grab any scripture
[55:09] they want and make it fit in their day
[55:12] paul the apostle does jesus christ does
[55:14] brother branham does
[55:18] we need to have the mind of christ
[55:22] not the mind of a man
[55:26] so let's go to romans
[55:29] chapter 16.
[55:35] so jesus christ was manifest to destroy
[55:37] the works of the devil
[55:41] his body will do the same brother graham
[55:43] says
[55:45] he's not making an analogy he's properly
[55:48] placing the scriptures
[55:51] romans 16 20.
[55:56] romans chapter 16 verse 20 and the god
[55:58] of peace shall brew satan
[56:00] under your feet shortly
[56:06] wait a minute paul paul you've made a
[56:08] mistake
[56:10] oh apostle paul you've done you've
[56:13] really done it this time you've went out
[56:15] on the limb
[56:16] because the prophecy i read the prophecy
[56:18] i can go back to genesis 3 and i can
[56:20] read the prophecy
[56:22] and he says that serpent shall bruise
[56:25] the seed of the woman
[56:27] it's the seed of the woman and the
[56:28] serpent shall breathe his heal and he
[56:30] shall bruise his head
[56:32] so paul i've read the old testament i
[56:34] read it i studied it in seminary
[56:36] i could tell you the hebrew amen i know
[56:38] all the punctuation
[56:39] i got a down path that prophecy is for
[56:42] the seed of the woman and here the
[56:44] apostle paul picks it up
[56:46] and he says and the god of peace shall
[56:47] brew satan under your
[56:49] feet shortly i thought that applied
[56:53] somewhere else
[56:53] in another time unto jesus christ i
[56:56] thought he did that at calvary
[57:00] he did and he's doing it again
[57:04] under your feet amen because it's christ
[57:08] christ on calvary christ in the bride
[57:10] amen
[57:11] christ is the manifested word on earth
[57:13] that is bruising the head
[57:15] of satan
[57:16] [Applause]
[57:19] how can paul do this because he's a
[57:21] prophet
[57:23] how can brother branham do that he's a
[57:25] prophet
[57:29] let's go to john chapter five i think
[57:32] i'm ready to get to my text
[57:35] on chapter five don't amen too loud i
[57:38] get
[57:39] my feelings hurt
[57:45] john chapter 5 verse 39
[57:53] jesus says search the scriptures for
[57:56] in them you think you have eternal life
[57:59] and they are they that testify
[58:01] which testify of me now put yourself
[58:04] right here
[58:06] let's not go let's not use a a modern
[58:09] thing
[58:09] let's go right here jesus is here
[58:13] living a life manifesting signs the
[58:15] pharisees have no idea where he come
[58:17] from didn't come from their school
[58:19] doesn't have a formal education he's
[58:21] saying things about the word
[58:22] that they have never said to ever been
[58:24] taught and never seen it that way before
[58:28] but he's doing things to back it up amen
[58:31] and they're they're coming against him
[58:32] and they're trying to contradict him
[58:34] what they're trying to do to jesus is
[58:36] they're trying to find
[58:37] fault so that it can discredit him
[58:40] they're trying to find somewhere even
[58:43] where they can fault him so
[58:44] they find out he's illegitimate born and
[58:47] he was raised in nazareth and supposed
[58:48] to come out they're trying to find
[58:50] some way that they can make him wrong so
[58:52] they can discredit him
[58:53] because he's a threat to their kingdom
[58:56] he's a threat to the religious leaders
[58:58] he's a threat to the preachers
[58:59] and so what they have to do is they have
[59:01] to say you've got to be wrong somewhere
[59:04] and jesus looks at him and he says
[59:06] search the scriptures
[59:08] you're preachers search the scriptures
[59:12] in them you think you have eternal life
[59:15] he never said they had it
[59:19] he said in them you think you have
[59:21] eternal life
[59:23] but the very thing the very thing that
[59:26] you're
[59:26] basing your eternal destination on
[59:30] is the very thing that testifies of who
[59:32] i am
[59:35] and you've missed it if you've missed
[59:39] him
[59:40] did you get eternal life they were
[59:43] reading the scriptures
[59:45] and basing off what they read in the
[59:47] scriptures they thought they had eternal
[59:49] life
[59:50] but he said they are they that testify
[59:53] of me
[59:55] so the very scriptures that you're
[59:56] reading and putting stock in for eternal
[59:59] life
[1:00:00] are the very scriptures that are
[1:00:01] speaking of jesus christ but you're
[1:00:03] rejecting him
[1:00:05] and if you're rejecting him are you
[1:00:07] really saved by these scriptures
[1:00:12] no sir there's something jesus is
[1:00:15] pointing out there's something you've
[1:00:16] missed
[1:00:18] you think you have eternal life but the
[1:00:21] very thing that you're reading
[1:00:23] and feeling confident and comfortable
[1:00:25] that everything's fine with you
[1:00:26] are the very scriptures that point of me
[1:00:29] that declare me
[1:00:30] and you're rejecting me showing that you
[1:00:32] have nothing to be confident about
[1:00:35] you're misreading the scriptures
[1:00:40] hallelujah amen
[1:00:44] you know history repeats itself it just
[1:00:46] keeps running in a revolving cycle amen
[1:00:48] it just comes back around and back
[1:00:50] around spirits don't die and they just
[1:00:52] manifested another body they just change
[1:00:54] bodies all the way down through time the
[1:00:55] same thing jesus faces the same thing
[1:00:57] we're facing now
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:01:00] search the scriptures for in them you
[1:01:01] think you have eternal life and they are
[1:01:02] they
[1:01:03] which testify of me brother man says in
[1:01:06] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:01:07] now notice again he said
[1:01:09] search the scriptures for they are they
[1:01:10] that testify of me search the scriptures
[1:01:13] the scriptures the entire
[1:01:14] scriptures amen don't leave anything out
[1:01:19] search the whole scriptures because
[1:01:21] brother bram said this whole thing is
[1:01:22] the record of christ
[1:01:25] if you go back and you read a line and
[1:01:26] you don't see christ in every line go
[1:01:28] back and read it again you missed
[1:01:29] something
[1:01:31] so what the prophet said search the
[1:01:33] scriptures were there to testify me
[1:01:34] search the scriptures
[1:01:35] the scriptures the entire scriptures
[1:01:38] what am i trying to do to show you that
[1:01:39] this bible is the thing that's right
[1:01:43] amen now here
[1:01:47] paragraph 120 says now here he says
[1:01:49] search the scriptures they testify of me
[1:01:51] in them you think you have eternal life
[1:01:53] and that's true and they are the one
[1:01:55] that bear record of me
[1:01:56] and i'm bearing record of them and if i
[1:01:58] do not the works that's promised that i
[1:02:00] would do
[1:02:00] then don't hear me but if i do the works
[1:02:03] and you can't believe me believe the
[1:02:05] works because they testify that he is
[1:02:07] the word
[1:02:08] oh it looks like it couldn't be any
[1:02:10] plainer see all right now search the
[1:02:12] scriptures
[1:02:12] he said moses and all the law and so
[1:02:14] forth the prophets in psalms spoke of
[1:02:16] him and again
[1:02:17] he said the scriptures testify of him
[1:02:20] further down in paragraph 128 he says
[1:02:22] now you realize that any of these places
[1:02:24] here you could take a text
[1:02:25] and just it's hard for a preacher to
[1:02:27] hold his peace it looked like he want to
[1:02:29] keep going with it but you've got to get
[1:02:31] back to what we're teaching on he is the
[1:02:34] principal theme of the bible
[1:02:36] he was in the prophets he was in the
[1:02:38] psalms he was in the history of the
[1:02:40] bible
[1:02:41] the bible is a prophetic book it's a
[1:02:42] historical book it's a book of love it's
[1:02:44] a book of songs
[1:02:45] it's a book of life and there you find
[1:02:47] christ he was in the prophets he was in
[1:02:50] the psalms he was in the history
[1:02:52] and he is also in the bible is the thing
[1:02:54] that is to come
[1:02:55] so he was before till after what does
[1:02:58] that make him
[1:02:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:03:03] what does this make this bible the
[1:03:05] written record of christ
[1:03:10] search the scriptures in them you think
[1:03:14] you have eternal life and they are they
[1:03:15] that testify of me
[1:03:18] they testify of christ
[1:03:21] let's turn to luke chapter 24.
[1:03:31] luke chapter 24.
[1:03:44] hallelujah verse 13.
[1:03:48] this is after jesus had been crucified
[1:03:51] and buried and resurrected
[1:03:53] this is the road to emmaus story verse
[1:03:56] 13 says and behold two of them went the
[1:03:58] same day
[1:03:59] to a village called emmaus which was
[1:04:00] from jerusalem about three score
[1:04:02] furlongs
[1:04:03] 60 furlongs and they talked together of
[1:04:07] all these things which had happened and
[1:04:08] it came to pass that while they communed
[1:04:10] together
[1:04:11] and reasoned jesus himself drew near and
[1:04:14] went with them
[1:04:15] but their eyes were holding that they
[1:04:17] should not know him
[1:04:19] so who is it that's walking beside them
[1:04:22] jesus
[1:04:22] himself is what the scripture says but
[1:04:25] if you pick it up in mark and you look
[1:04:26] at mark
[1:04:27] when when he when mary magdalene had
[1:04:30] seen him and not recognized him
[1:04:31] she supposed he was the gardener now
[1:04:35] mary magdalene knew what jesus looked
[1:04:36] like
[1:04:37] she had seen him on multiple occasions
[1:04:39] she had followed the ministry she had
[1:04:41] been wherever he was at she was in the
[1:04:43] meetings amen
[1:04:44] as often as she could be there mary
[1:04:45] magdalene was wherever jesus was
[1:04:47] she was intimately familiar with him she
[1:04:49] knew what he looked like and here
[1:04:50] jesus himself not another person
[1:04:55] jesus himself is talking to mary and
[1:04:58] mary does not recognize
[1:05:00] him supposing him to be the gardener
[1:05:05] until he says mary
[1:05:10] and then she says rabboni being master
[1:05:15] what opened her eyes his voice
[1:05:18] calling her name what opened our eyes
[1:05:22] his voice calling our name how did he
[1:05:25] call our name he revealed the mysteries
[1:05:26] the revealing of the mysteries was
[1:05:28] calling our name
[1:05:29] he called us the same way because this
[1:05:31] mary magdalene
[1:05:32] is the woman typing the church she's the
[1:05:34] first one to see jesus after his
[1:05:36] resurrection and she happens to be a
[1:05:38] woman that had an ill-famed life
[1:05:40] that had seven devils cast out of her
[1:05:42] she had come and
[1:05:43] been rescued from the seven church ages
[1:05:45] and after she come out of the seven
[1:05:47] church ages amen and jesus christ she's
[1:05:50] the first one
[1:05:51] to recognize he's resurrected
[1:05:55] they all thought that they had taken his
[1:05:57] body somewhere and she even asked the
[1:05:58] gardener where have you laid him
[1:06:02] the carnal understanding the carnal mind
[1:06:05] seeing an empty tomb says stolen body
[1:06:09] but there's got to come a revelation of
[1:06:11] the word to this woman who's come
[1:06:13] through the seven churches and been
[1:06:14] delivered to the seven devils
[1:06:16] and now she's the first one to stand
[1:06:18] talking to the resurrected jesus christ
[1:06:21] and she doesn't even know it's him it's
[1:06:24] possible that
[1:06:25] jesus christ could be standing talking
[1:06:27] to you and you wouldn't even know it's
[1:06:29] him
[1:06:29] because he's not in that body there but
[1:06:31] he's in another
[1:06:33] form
[1:06:37] that's the bible that's
[1:06:40] mary magdalene it was jesus himself
[1:06:44] not jesus and something else jesus in
[1:06:46] another way it was jesus himself
[1:06:48] amen and he wanted to open her eyes so
[1:06:50] to open her eyes
[1:06:51] amen he called her name revealing the
[1:06:54] mysteries is calling the name
[1:06:56] it was his voice calling her name all he
[1:06:58] had to do was say
[1:07:00] mary and her eyes were open she knew it
[1:07:03] was the lord
[1:07:06] all he had to do was call us and we
[1:07:07] recognize who it was talking to us
[1:07:10] that's not a man from kentucky that's
[1:07:12] jesus christ
[1:07:14] in another form
[1:07:18] then that same scripture in mark that
[1:07:20] says that it said and then
[1:07:21] he appeared to two others
[1:07:24] in another form
[1:07:28] and they're speaking to the two on the
[1:07:30] road to the mass he comes
[1:07:33] in another form
[1:07:36] if it's jesus christ on another form
[1:07:39] what do you call it
[1:07:44] it's not the same body that was pierced
[1:07:46] with nails
[1:07:48] it wasn't the same body that was was
[1:07:50] pierced through the feet
[1:07:51] it wasn't the same one that had marks on
[1:07:53] his skull amen
[1:07:54] and down his head from the thorn it
[1:07:56] wasn't that same one but it was the same
[1:07:58] person
[1:08:01] he was there he was talking to them the
[1:08:04] scripture says
[1:08:05] jesus himself drew deer and the bible
[1:08:09] said
[1:08:09] he showed himself to two others in
[1:08:11] another
[1:08:12] form in another form it was jesus
[1:08:16] himself that's
[1:08:19] the bible that's not the figment of a
[1:08:22] man's imagination
[1:08:23] that's a bible but you've got to grow up
[1:08:26] out of christian
[1:08:27] kindergarten got to get out of first
[1:08:29] grade we've got to have spiritual eyes
[1:08:31] of revelation to see
[1:08:32] he can be there and here all at the same
[1:08:34] time heaven's here
[1:08:36] heaven has come down the two dimensions
[1:08:39] are blending together and they're
[1:08:40] blending together
[1:08:41] in the bride that's why jesus christ
[1:08:45] could stand in flesh
[1:08:46] looking at nicodemus and say the son of
[1:08:48] man which is in heaven
[1:08:50] was he in heaven yes was he on the earth
[1:08:53] yes
[1:08:55] he was a multi-dimensional being
[1:08:58] this bride has been called out of the
[1:09:00] laodicean church called into a higher
[1:09:02] spiritual realm
[1:09:03] this body is still working walking in a
[1:09:05] world there's an
[1:09:06] absolute utter darkness it's a laodicean
[1:09:09] condition
[1:09:10] laodicea is going all around and my body
[1:09:12] is walking through a world in laodicea
[1:09:14] but i have been resurrected out of dead
[1:09:16] denominationalism
[1:09:17] i have been lifted by the opening of the
[1:09:19] word the open door in revelations 4 and
[1:09:21] lifted into a higher plane
[1:09:23] and i am walking in two places at the
[1:09:26] same time
[1:09:27] seated in heavenly places in christ
[1:09:28] jesus and with my
[1:09:30] feet and flesh on this earth
[1:09:34] the same position jesus christ was in
[1:09:36] when he was talking to nicodemus
[1:09:39] and here he comes on the road to emmaus
[1:09:42] in another
[1:09:43] form but the bible says
[1:09:48] jesus himself drew near
[1:09:53] how can it be him if it doesn't look
[1:09:55] like him
[1:09:58] you mean jesus himself can come in
[1:10:00] another body
[1:10:06] jesus himself drew near and went with
[1:10:08] them
[1:10:10] but their eyes were holding that they
[1:10:11] should not know him
[1:10:14] and he said unto them what man of
[1:10:16] communications are these that you have
[1:10:18] one to another as you walk and are sad
[1:10:20] and one of them whose name was cleopas
[1:10:23] answered said unto him aren't thou only
[1:10:25] a stranger in jerusalem and has not
[1:10:27] known the things
[1:10:28] which are come to pass there in these
[1:10:29] days
[1:10:31] he said unto them what things and they
[1:10:34] said unto him concerning jesus of
[1:10:35] nazareth which was a prophet might
[1:10:38] indeed in word before god and all people
[1:10:40] and how the chief priests and the rulers
[1:10:42] delivered him
[1:10:43] to be condemned to death and have
[1:10:45] crucified him
[1:10:47] but we trusted that it had been he which
[1:10:49] should have redeemed israel and beside
[1:10:51] all this
[1:10:52] today is the third day since these
[1:10:53] things are done yey and certain women
[1:10:56] also of our
[1:10:56] company made us astonish which were
[1:10:59] early at the sepulcher
[1:11:00] and when they found not his body they
[1:11:02] came saying that they had also seen a
[1:11:04] vision of angels
[1:11:05] which said that he was alive and certain
[1:11:08] of them which
[1:11:09] which were with us went to the sepulcher
[1:11:11] and found it even so as the woman had
[1:11:13] said
[1:11:13] but him they saw not
[1:11:17] see how funny this is they're
[1:11:20] complaining
[1:11:22] they're on the road to emmaus they're
[1:11:24] leaving jerusalem which
[1:11:26] is a type of the church and they're
[1:11:28] walking away
[1:11:30] from jerusalem and he told them to wait
[1:11:34] in jerusalem
[1:11:36] they're walking away from jerusalem
[1:11:40] and he himself jesus
[1:11:43] himself comes out and joins them
[1:11:47] but in another form is what mark says
[1:11:51] he's walking along there and they're
[1:11:53] complaining
[1:11:54] we thought it had been he that should
[1:11:56] save us
[1:11:58] it was he he is saving you
[1:12:02] they were looking with carnal eyes with
[1:12:04] an intellectual understanding
[1:12:06] and missing what was happening present
[1:12:08] tense
[1:12:10] it's easy to miss what's happening
[1:12:11] present tense when you have to
[1:12:13] understand it with your brain
[1:12:17] or see it with your eyes or touch it
[1:12:20] with your hands
[1:12:22] here he is himself he himself jesus
[1:12:24] himself
[1:12:25] so the bible says jesus himself
[1:12:30] and now they're complaining that they
[1:12:33] they said that he he was gone his body
[1:12:36] was
[1:12:37] was not in the sepulchre and they went
[1:12:40] and they found him not
[1:12:43] we don't know where he's at he's
[1:12:45] standing right next to you
[1:12:48] they're crying about jesus body being
[1:12:51] gone
[1:12:51] his body's gone we don't know where he
[1:12:53] is and they've
[1:12:55] stolen that they're taking it somewhere
[1:12:56] and we can't find him he's standing
[1:12:59] right next to you but you're so
[1:13:02] spiritually blind
[1:13:04] and you didn't hear what he was telling
[1:13:05] you on earth you took a carnal
[1:13:07] interpretation
[1:13:08] and you're missing the very event that's
[1:13:10] unfolding you're walking right in the
[1:13:12] vision
[1:13:12] and you're missing what's happened
[1:13:14] because you're looking for nail prints
[1:13:17] brother man said we don't look for nail
[1:13:18] prints we look for the word made
[1:13:20] manifest
[1:13:21] and where the word made manifest that's
[1:13:23] him in this day
[1:13:24] it's he himself walking
[1:13:28] with us on the road to emmaus open our
[1:13:30] eyes lord and let us see
[1:13:32] who's here with us oh oh
[1:13:35] he's gone he's not here when he gets
[1:13:37] back it's going to be wonderful
[1:13:39] he's back it's wonderful open your eyes
[1:13:42] and see who's walking right
[1:13:44] with us
[1:13:47] they took his body what do you care
[1:13:50] about the body
[1:13:52] i'm here
[1:13:58] can you imagine jesus is standing there
[1:14:00] in another word jesus
[1:14:01] himself i just want to refer that jesus
[1:14:04] himself because it's so easy to say
[1:14:06] if that body is somewhere else and it's
[1:14:08] not jesus himself no
[1:14:09] the bible says jesus himself in another
[1:14:12] form
[1:14:14] himself is standing there
[1:14:17] and they're saying we we don't know
[1:14:20] where they took his body
[1:14:21] we can't find his body where's his body
[1:14:24] and jesus stands there
[1:14:25] forget the body i can come into anybody
[1:14:28] anybody i want i can take over
[1:14:30] it's the life you should be looking for
[1:14:32] it's the manifestation of the word
[1:14:33] quit looking for the body and look for
[1:14:35] the life look for the word made manifest
[1:14:38] look for the promise being unfolded the
[1:14:40] promise of a resurrection the
[1:14:42] promise that i will come to you look for
[1:14:44] the promise quit looking for the body
[1:14:46] leaving jerusalem leaving the place
[1:14:48] you're supposed to stay and walking away
[1:14:50] down into the church ages walking away
[1:14:53] [Applause]
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:14:55] why because they don't see his body
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:01] didn't see his body and we're sad he
[1:15:04] said why do you walk along the way and
[1:15:05] talk and are sad
[1:15:07] well we're sad because he's dead he's
[1:15:10] gone
[1:15:11] and we can't see his body
[1:15:15] why are you sad i'm here
[1:15:19] i'm standing right next to you i'm
[1:15:22] walking with you
[1:15:23] the head has been united with the body
[1:15:26] in an invisible union
[1:15:27] he himself has come to her
[1:15:31] why are we sad because i don't see his
[1:15:33] body i'll be happy when i see his body
[1:15:35] if i can't be happy about the
[1:15:36] manifestation of the word his body's not
[1:15:38] going to change anything from me
[1:15:40] if i can't see him now in the unveiling
[1:15:42] of himself unveiling of god
[1:15:44] unveiling of the word and recognizing
[1:15:46] his presence what makes me think i'm
[1:15:48] going to be happy when i see a nail
[1:15:49] scarred body
[1:15:50] amen it's the same jesus jesus himself
[1:15:54] is here in the form of his bride and if
[1:15:57] i can't be excited about that
[1:15:58] he's already said mary amen mary was
[1:16:02] excited she was ecstatic
[1:16:03] he meant he didn't have to have nail
[1:16:05] scars as soon as he said
[1:16:07] mary she didn't need nail scars she
[1:16:09] didn't need the same body she didn't
[1:16:11] need the same garment she didn't care
[1:16:12] what form it was in
[1:16:13] she said raboni
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:17] she was excited she was happy all her
[1:16:19] questions vanished
[1:16:20] all of a sudden she was excited not
[1:16:24] because she saw
[1:16:25] nail prints amen but because she heard
[1:16:27] him call her name
[1:16:29] and she recognized that's him
[1:16:34] hallelujah we got to grow up
[1:16:39] we got to mature spiritually we got to
[1:16:41] get out of kindergarten
[1:16:43] playing with little blocks this
[1:16:45] scripture goes here and this scripture
[1:16:47] goes here
[1:16:48] oh my goodness amen the scriptures that
[1:16:51] speak of christ are the same scriptures
[1:16:52] that speak of the bride
[1:16:53] [Applause]
[1:16:58] the prophet has already told us he's
[1:17:00] already pointed out we just have to
[1:17:02] believe it he's not making analogies
[1:17:04] he's interpreting the word
[1:17:07] hallelujah let's get back here
[1:17:16] 22 and certain women also of our company
[1:17:17] made us astonish which were early at the
[1:17:19] sepulcher
[1:17:20] when they found nana's body they came
[1:17:21] saying they also seen a vision of angels
[1:17:24] not that they had really seen angels
[1:17:26] we're having a hard time believing this
[1:17:28] because we didn't see it
[1:17:30] so they saw a vision they didn't really
[1:17:32] see angels they saw a vision of angels
[1:17:35] brother maybe it was a dream maybe you
[1:17:37] ate something
[1:17:38] amen they knew what they saw
[1:17:42] also seen a vision of angels which said
[1:17:44] that he was alive
[1:17:46] hallelujah and certain of them which
[1:17:49] were with us went to the sepulchre and
[1:17:51] found it even so as the women
[1:17:53] as the women had said but him they saw
[1:17:56] not where's the problem
[1:18:00] you saw it was just like they said the
[1:18:02] angels told them that he's alive
[1:18:04] why are you walking away from jerusalem
[1:18:06] why are you walking in the church ages
[1:18:09] leaving jerusalem why are you so sad
[1:18:12] he's alive i didn't see his body
[1:18:20] my goodness you realize jesus is going
[1:18:24] to rebuke them hard
[1:18:26] for not believing it's not seeing it's
[1:18:30] believing
[1:18:33] all right
[1:18:37] but him they saw not i just love that
[1:18:41] they're sad walking away from jerusalem
[1:18:42] because they didn't see him oh the angel
[1:18:44] said he's alive
[1:18:45] and when they went sure enough his body
[1:18:47] was gone but i don't know
[1:18:49] it just doesn't make sense to me i don't
[1:18:51] see him
[1:18:54] he's standing he's the one talking to
[1:18:55] you right now
[1:18:59] open your eyes he's the one on the road
[1:19:02] he's the one on the journey he's right
[1:19:04] here jesus himself is right here
[1:19:06] amen but i don't see oh when i see him
[1:19:08] oh that day
[1:19:10] my goodness we're in the day
[1:19:12] [Applause]
[1:19:14] jesus is here in another form
[1:19:17] it's time to describe cry raboni master
[1:19:21] lord you're here everything's fine my
[1:19:23] questions are answered i'm happy
[1:19:25] i'm rejoicing i'm testifying because now
[1:19:28] i recognize
[1:19:28] you're here it's just another form it
[1:19:31] wasn't what i expected it wasn't the
[1:19:32] same one that i seen crucified but it
[1:19:34] doesn't matter i heard your voice
[1:19:36] you called my name and i know it's you
[1:19:41] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:44] hallelujah
[1:19:44] hallelujah that's the message that's
[1:19:47] what makes our hearts burn
[1:19:48] that's why they call us crazy that's why
[1:19:51] amen the whole world will one day band
[1:19:53] together to shut this church down
[1:19:55] because they think we've lost your
[1:19:56] rocker they don't realize we see what
[1:19:59] they don't see
[1:19:59] they don't realize amen we don't need a
[1:20:02] body with nail prints to recognize
[1:20:04] that he's here jesus himself is here
[1:20:07] we're walking in two worlds at the same
[1:20:09] time brother branham said jesus walked
[1:20:11] in a world
[1:20:12] all to himself what kind of world do you
[1:20:14] think the bride's going to walk in
[1:20:18] one that makes sense to everybody around
[1:20:20] us one that could be easily explained
[1:20:23] amen one that they said how
[1:20:26] how can how can he be here and there
[1:20:29] at the same time
[1:20:32] how can i go back into my mother's womb
[1:20:34] a second time
[1:20:36] how can you say the son of man is in
[1:20:38] heaven and you say you're the son of man
[1:20:41] how amen it's not our job to explain it
[1:20:45] friends
[1:20:46] just answer like jesus you call yourself
[1:20:49] a preacher
[1:20:51] and you don't know these things you call
[1:20:53] yourself a child of god search the
[1:20:55] scriptures
[1:20:56] and then you think of eternal life these
[1:20:58] are they that testify of me
[1:21:00] what i'm telling you is laying in the
[1:21:02] word just believe it
[1:21:04] it doesn't lay in there according to
[1:21:05] your seminary teaching or to
[1:21:07] 2000 years of indoctrination through the
[1:21:10] church ages of course not
[1:21:11] amen because they messed the word up i'm
[1:21:14] not going to go read what matthew henry
[1:21:16] said about the word
[1:21:17] matthew henry didn't have the full
[1:21:19] revelation of the word
[1:21:21] i like charles spurgeon but i'm not
[1:21:22] going to rely on what charles spurgeon
[1:21:24] said
[1:21:25] charles spurgeon was revealing the word
[1:21:26] for his day but he only had
[1:21:28] partial light he didn't have the full
[1:21:29] light but what's coming this day is full
[1:21:32] light on the scriptures when he opened
[1:21:34] the seals
[1:21:35] he took the veil off the entire bible
[1:21:38] the whole word is open and unveiled and
[1:21:42] unsealed amen i'm not going to go back
[1:21:44] for a partial
[1:21:45] understanding brother branham says this
[1:21:46] but what did matthew henry say forget
[1:21:48] matthew henry
[1:21:50] amen he built and he built and he built
[1:21:52] through matthew godly man
[1:21:54] man of god we're going to see him on the
[1:21:55] other side charles spurgeon
[1:21:58] finney knox are all godly men but god
[1:22:00] was building revelation upon revelation
[1:22:02] upon revelation
[1:22:03] amen and we're not to go backwards
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:06] here they are walking out of jerusalem
[1:22:09] walking away from
[1:22:10] jerusalem
[1:22:13] but god and his mercy comes to them
[1:22:16] and walks with them in another form
[1:22:25] but him they saw not then he said unto
[1:22:29] them oh fools
[1:22:32] that wasn't a nice word
[1:22:36] that wasn't a really nice thing to say
[1:22:42] the preacher should always say nice
[1:22:43] things no just say what jesus said
[1:22:47] o fools and slow of heart o
[1:22:50] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:22:52] that the prophets have spoken
[1:22:55] are not christ who have suffered see it
[1:22:57] wasn't that they didn't believe anything
[1:22:59] they didn't believe at all
[1:23:02] well fools and slow of heart to believe
[1:23:04] all that the prophets have spoken
[1:23:06] ought not christ to have suffered these
[1:23:07] things and to enter into his glory
[1:23:09] and beginning at moses and all the
[1:23:12] prophets

[1:23:15] the things concerning himself
[1:23:18] hallelujah i'd loved to have been there
[1:23:21] starting at moses now he's not talking
[1:23:22] about moses life he's talking about
[1:23:24] moses writings which starts in genesis
[1:23:26] so starting at the beginning of the
[1:23:28] bible and all through the prophets
[1:23:29] he's talking to them the entire bible on
[1:23:34] the road to emmaus
[1:23:35] jesus now in another form one that they
[1:23:38] don't recognize him as jesus yet
[1:23:41] but he's breaking down to them the
[1:23:43] scripture starting at moses starting in
[1:23:46] genesis
[1:23:46] and going all the way through all the
[1:23:48] prophets he's taking the entire
[1:23:51] scripture the entire bible for his text

[1:23:59] the mystery of god revealed showing the
[1:24:01] seventh seal and he says i take the
[1:24:03] entire
[1:24:04] bible for my text
[1:24:08] oh hallelujah friends here he comes
[1:24:11] in another form what form do you think
[1:24:14] that was
[1:24:15] that was the form of son of man in a
[1:24:17] prophet that was not a man
[1:24:19] taking christ the mystery of god
[1:24:20] revealed that was god
[1:24:22] in a man that was the son of man that
[1:24:25] was jesus christ
[1:24:26] in another form saying i will take the
[1:24:28] entire
[1:24:30] bible for my text
[1:24:34] these guys on the road to master said
[1:24:36] wow this guy is kind of smart
[1:24:40] he knows a lot and i'm sure as their
[1:24:42] heart's burning within them
[1:24:43] amen as they talk to them along the way
[1:24:46] it's like
[1:24:46] wow i never saw that wow where is he
[1:24:49] getting all this stuff
[1:24:53] see at that point all they could see was
[1:24:55] the form

[1:24:59] can see the form but i can't identify
[1:25:01] who it is
[1:25:04] so many times we can see the form
[1:25:07] and miss who it is well that's the form
[1:25:11] of brother branham no who is it
[1:25:14] who is it he who is it that opened the
[1:25:16] seals
[1:25:18] said christ opened the seals christ is
[1:25:20] those seals what is the opening of seals
[1:25:22] revealing christ
[1:25:24] it was christ in another form the form
[1:25:26] of an end-time prophet
[1:25:28] the form of a man revealing a son of man
[1:25:31] revealing the son of man
[1:25:35] quit looking at the form and start
[1:25:37] looking for the word made manifest the
[1:25:40] revealing of the word in our hour and
[1:25:41] then we'll recognize him
[1:25:44] hallelujah let's keep reading oh fools

[1:25:48] all the prophets have spoken not not
[1:25:50] christ have suffered these things and
[1:25:51] entered into his glory
[1:25:52] and beginning at moses and all the
[1:25:54] prophets he expounded unto them all the
[1:25:56] scriptures the things concerning
[1:25:57] himself what was the bible talking about
[1:26:02] him he goes back and reads adam and eve
[1:26:05] it's him
[1:26:06] abraham him moses him exodus him he's
[1:26:09] talking about him because this entire
[1:26:11] bible is christ
[1:26:13] and here is christ in another form and
[1:26:16] he's talking them out of the scriptures
[1:26:17] all things that are referring to him
[1:26:24] hallelujah how about when he starts to
[1:26:26] break down
[1:26:27] all things that referring to him as her
[1:26:29] [Applause]
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:32] when he starts breaking down the
[1:26:33] scriptures and then he starts going
[1:26:35] through the scriptures to the entire
[1:26:36] bible
[1:26:37] and starts showing the seven seal
[1:26:38] mystery the threefold plan of god and
[1:26:40] gets into the second phone and starts
[1:26:41] showing

[1:26:52] he called their name adam it was one
[1:26:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:00] let's keep reading 28 and they drew nigh
[1:27:05] into the village whether
[1:27:06] they went and he made as though he would
[1:27:08] have gone farther
[1:27:09] further but they constrained him saying
[1:27:11] abide with us
[1:27:12] for this toward evening oh evening time
[1:27:16] we've walked all day and now we've come
[1:27:19] to the evening time
[1:27:21] and the day is far spent and he went in
[1:27:23] to terry with them and it came to pass
[1:27:25] as he sat and meet with them he took
[1:27:27] bread and blessed it and break and gave
[1:27:29] to them
[1:27:29] and their eyes were opened
[1:27:33] then say he changed his form
[1:27:37] didn't say all the sudden he showed him
[1:27:39] nail print
[1:27:40] no he didn't say he changed his form he
[1:27:42] said their eyes were open
[1:27:44] the problem wasn't with the form he was
[1:27:46] in the problem was in their spiritual
[1:27:47] eyesight
[1:27:51] don't ask him to change his form ask him
[1:27:53] to open our eyes
[1:27:55] lord don't change your form i'm going to
[1:27:56] say i'll believe you when i see i'll
[1:27:58] believe you in this
[1:27:59] i'll believe you in the meeting and
[1:28:00] there i'll believe that don't ask him to
[1:28:01] change his form
[1:28:03] so that we'll believe ask him to open
[1:28:05] our eyes so we'll see him
[1:28:06] whatever form he's in today
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:11] amen and their eyes were open and they
[1:28:13] knew him
[1:28:14] and he vanished out of their sight and
[1:28:16] they said one to another did not our
[1:28:18] heart burn within us as he talked with
[1:28:20] us by the way
[1:28:21] and while he opened to us the scriptures
[1:28:24] it was the third pull the opening of the
[1:28:25] word in the evening time
[1:28:28] and they rose up the same hour and
[1:28:31] returned to jerusalem and found the
[1:28:33] eleven gathered together and them which
[1:28:34] were with them
[1:28:35] saying the lord has risen indeed and
[1:28:38] hath appeared to simon and they told
[1:28:40] what things were done in the way and how
[1:28:42] he was known of them in breaking
[1:28:44] of bread he was known in
[1:28:47] breaking the bread breaking the bread of
[1:28:49] life breaking the man and breaking the
[1:28:50] word
[1:28:51] and their eyes were open when in the
[1:28:54] evening time
[1:28:56] now brother bam says in events made
[1:28:58] clear by prophecy from 1965 he said
[1:29:00] here's another thing they had done you
[1:29:02] know they had heard
[1:29:04] a six-hour sermon on prophecy being
[1:29:07] vindicated
[1:29:09] now brother branham he takes this uh
[1:29:12] six score furlongs his 60 furlongs and
[1:29:14] he breaks it down
[1:29:15] says about six miles he says some
[1:29:17] amazing things
[1:29:19] why does it matter that it was six miles
[1:29:23] and why does it matter that it was six
[1:29:24] hours
[1:29:25] [Laughter]
[1:29:28] hallelujah god is so good
[1:29:31] prophet doesn't leave anything undone
[1:29:34] they heard a six hour sermon on prophecy
[1:29:36] being vindicated
[1:29:37] that's what he talked to them along the
[1:29:38] road just as soon as they started down
[1:29:40] the road he stepped out
[1:29:41] for he was right there at jerusalem six
[1:29:43] hours later 60 furlongs
[1:29:45] they was right down the road six miles
[1:29:47] to emmaus
[1:29:49] 64 long six miles six hours
[1:29:52] that's what it is and he had preached
[1:29:53] confirming prophecy for six hours
[1:29:55] don't condemn me on three then amen
[1:29:59] but notice they had preached they had
[1:30:00] heard a six hour sermon on prophecy and
[1:30:02] being confirmed vindicated
[1:30:04] now it was getting along toward evening
[1:30:05] time you know he's the same yesterday
[1:30:07] today and forever
[1:30:09] brother graham's always trying to get
[1:30:10] you to read between the lines
[1:30:12] see the hear the unspoken part the thing
[1:30:15] that's not said
[1:30:17] and now it's getting along towards
[1:30:20] evening time you know he's the same
[1:30:21] yesterday today and forever
[1:30:23] it was then that he opened their eyes to
[1:30:24] know that hebrews 13 8 he's the same
[1:30:26] yesterday forever
[1:30:28] at the evening time events are made
[1:30:30] clear by prophecy
[1:30:32] what was he doing he was taking all the
[1:30:33] prophets and he was revealing
[1:30:35] things concerning himself and in the
[1:30:37] evening time everything that was going
[1:30:39] on in their life was made clear by the
[1:30:40] prophecy
[1:30:43] what's taken place in the modern hour
[1:30:45] can be easily what's
[1:30:46] taking place in the modern hour
[1:30:50] can be easily identified if you'll just
[1:30:52] believe the prophecy of the hour
[1:30:55] same thing further down in same messages
[1:30:58] notice
[1:30:59] when these disciples invited him in
[1:31:00] their fellowship around the table
[1:31:02] it was then that he'd done something
[1:31:04] just like he did before his crucifixion
[1:31:06] and their eyes come open they knowed his
[1:31:09] manner his style
[1:31:10] they knowed what he'd done and he did it
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:13] he did it then just like he did before
[1:31:17] that's why brother branham shows us
[1:31:18] abraham on the plains of memory and he
[1:31:20] had his back to the tent
[1:31:21] beginning to discernment and brother
[1:31:23] branham and the sermon turns around
[1:31:25] and he turns around and starts
[1:31:26] discerning what's going on behind what's
[1:31:27] he doing he's showing
[1:31:28] he's doing something just like he did
[1:31:30] before
[1:31:32] to what so our eyes will come open amen
[1:31:35] so he can see
[1:31:36] that this is him
[1:31:40] amen now listen to this
[1:31:44] they knowed what he'd done and he did it
[1:31:46] then just like he did before
[1:31:47] and they said that's him and quickly
[1:31:49] they raised up to scream it out
[1:31:51] and he vanished and where they took six
[1:31:53] hours to listen to this sermon
[1:31:55] maybe 20 minutes they were light-footed
[1:31:57] back to tell the rest of them
[1:31:58] he is risen indeed he is really alive
[1:32:02] amen brother branham is showing us the
[1:32:05] scriptures showing us 64 long
[1:32:07] they're leaving jerusalem and now they
[1:32:10] begin walking in the church ages
[1:32:14] for six hours and for six hours six
[1:32:17] church ages
[1:32:19] he's with them in another form in the
[1:32:22] form of son of god
[1:32:25] he walks along and he talks to them
[1:32:27] about the word and
[1:32:28] and they get in at evening time after
[1:32:32] the six hour journey is done
[1:32:34] they're going to go into the seventh
[1:32:35] hour
[1:32:37] and the seventh hour is not going to
[1:32:40] take place in the journey
[1:32:41] it's going to take place in the privacy
[1:32:44] of the house
[1:32:46] around the table and they constrained
[1:32:49] him to come in
[1:32:50] and he came in so now we've come into
[1:32:52] the seventh hour and in the seventh hour
[1:32:54] in the seventh church age
[1:32:56] now he's going to reveal who has it been
[1:32:59] in the journey all along how will he
[1:33:02] identify himself
[1:33:03] he's got to do something just like he
[1:33:05] did it before
[1:33:08] he's got to create squirrels speak to a
[1:33:10] storm turn us back to a crowd
[1:33:12] open blinded eyes heal the lame heal
[1:33:14] epilepsy he's got to do something just
[1:33:16] like he did before
[1:33:18] in the seventh church age so that our
[1:33:19] eyes will come open and we'll recognize
[1:33:21] who has been in this journey all along
[1:33:26] the brother said it taken them six hours
[1:33:30] and that fast where do they go
[1:33:33] right back to jerusalem he turned their
[1:33:37] hearts back
[1:33:38] to the pentecostal fathers amen
[1:33:41] six hours journey six church ages but at
[1:33:44] the revealing hour
[1:33:46] amen in the small company not when
[1:33:48] anybody can walk past and hear what's
[1:33:49] being said
[1:33:50] not when anybody can join in on the
[1:33:52] conversation but when they went into the
[1:33:53] house
[1:33:54] and they invited him to the house and
[1:33:55] now he's going to do something and just
[1:33:57] like he did before and break the bread
[1:33:59] and their eyes were open
[1:34:00] and then he vanishes amen
[1:34:03] and then they run right back turn their
[1:34:05] hearts right back and go
[1:34:06] right back to the original place they
[1:34:09] started from
[1:34:10] right back to pentecost

[1:34:18] and look for him the word made manifest
[1:34:25] let's go back well i've already quoted
[1:34:27] that genesis chapter 5 verse 1 i'll just
[1:34:29] quote again
[1:34:30] this is the book of the generations of
[1:34:32] adam and the day that god created man
[1:34:34] the likeness of god made he him male and
[1:34:36] female created he them and blessed them
[1:34:38] and called their name adam in the day
[1:34:42] when they were
[1:34:42] created brother branham says in christ
[1:34:46] the mystery god revealed
[1:34:47] notice now down through the ages he has
[1:34:50] been gradually letting this out
[1:34:52] slowly unfolding the mystery through the
[1:34:56] prophets and through the types
[1:34:57] now we can just go on that onto that and
[1:35:00] expressing himself
[1:35:01] he expressed himself in moses look moses
[1:35:04] born in the time of persecution of
[1:35:06] children
[1:35:06] he was born to be a deliverer he was hid
[1:35:09] in the bull rushes just like jesus was
[1:35:10] taken down into egypt
[1:35:12] he come out he went up to the mountain
[1:35:13] come back with the commandments
[1:35:15] jesus went up to the mountain his first
[1:35:16] sermon on the mount come back down with

[1:35:25] woman to lust after has committed
[1:35:26] adultery

[1:35:30] so brother brahm's taking a little
[1:35:32] journey here in christ the mystery of
[1:35:33] god revealed and he's going back and
[1:35:34] he's showing
[1:35:35] all the types of jesus christ
[1:35:39] typing him and moses as law lawgiver
[1:35:41] timing him is he born at a time of
[1:35:43] persecution of children they were
[1:35:45] killing the babies in egypt when
[1:35:46] when moses was born herod was killing
[1:35:48] all all the baby boys
[1:35:50] amen in bethlehem when jesus was born
[1:35:53] he's showing
[1:35:53] all the types he's showing how moses was
[1:35:56] manifesting christ
[1:35:58] and he was speaking of christ coming
[1:36:00] that's why he says you have moses amen
[1:36:03] you you have moses you read moses moses
[1:36:05] testifies of me
[1:36:08] amen brother brennan is now showing us
[1:36:10] here christ the mystery of reveal
[1:36:11] it's not just when moses says god will
[1:36:13] send a prophet like unto me
[1:36:15] yes that's a prophecy of him coming but
[1:36:17] his whole
[1:36:18] life was testifying of his coming
[1:36:22] it wasn't just the words he pinned but
[1:36:24] his actual
[1:36:25] movements through life amen as he led
[1:36:28] them through an exodus amen as he as he
[1:36:30] did the things that he did
[1:36:31] his life was actually showing christ
[1:36:37] you have moses you believe moses
[1:36:40] moses wrote of me moses portrayed me
[1:36:44] moses amen he displayed what it was
[1:36:47] going to be like
[1:36:50] he goes on and says he expressed himself
[1:36:52] in joseph born amongst denomination his
[1:36:54] brethren
[1:36:55] they hated him without a cause because
[1:36:57] he was spiritual
[1:36:58] he saw visions god was with him he could
[1:37:00] interpret dreams
[1:37:02] his brothers hated him by his brethren
[1:37:05] he was sold by his brother and by almost
[1:37:07] 30 pieces of silver just exactly like he
[1:37:09] was sold by judas iscariot
[1:37:10] one of his brethren by 30 pieces of
[1:37:12] silver he was thrown into a ditch and
[1:37:14] supposed to be dead that's right the
[1:37:15] father in them
[1:37:16] was told he was dead that he's thrown
[1:37:18] into a ditch taken up and went to the
[1:37:20] right hand of pharaoh
[1:37:21] in the dungeon how he suffered there and
[1:37:23] there was two saved the butler and the
[1:37:25] baker one of them lost one was saved
[1:37:27] rather
[1:37:28] and one of them was lost and the other
[1:37:29] one saved just as on the cross when he
[1:37:30] was in prison house
[1:37:31] tacked to the cross for our sins became
[1:37:34] a prisoner one thief was lost and one
[1:37:36] was saved see
[1:37:37] just exactly then he became at the right
[1:37:39] hand of pharaoh the king that he dreamed
[1:37:41] that he had the vision that he would set
[1:37:42] at the king's feet and all authority in
[1:37:44] egypt was given to him
[1:37:46] his vision had to come to pass so
[1:37:48] brother branham and christ is mr god he
[1:37:50] starts showing us
[1:37:51] through the types not just the
[1:37:54] prophecies
[1:37:55] he's shown us through the types jesus
[1:37:57] christ was portrayed in moses
[1:37:59] he was they should have seen it they
[1:38:02] should have recognized
[1:38:03] it's the same thing further down he says
[1:38:06] now notice that
[1:38:08] through the types we could take even
[1:38:09] david as a spoken of a while ago going
[1:38:12] off his throne rejected by his own
[1:38:13] people
[1:38:14] going up the same mountain mount of
[1:38:15] olives as he's going over to his prison
[1:38:18] he was going to his prison house because
[1:38:19] he was rejected of his brother and of
[1:38:21] his own people
[1:38:22] he went up weeping that was the spirit
[1:38:24] of christ in him to be rejected as he
[1:38:25] looked out over jerusalem and wept and
[1:38:27] said jerusalem
[1:38:28] how oft i would a rejected king 800
[1:38:32] years later the son of david stood on
[1:38:33] jerusalem up there above jerusalem and
[1:38:35] rejected and wept over jerusalem and
[1:38:37] said
[1:38:37] now your hour has come that's right
[1:38:40] all these things typed him just in time
[1:38:43] but yet the mystery was hid them men
[1:38:46] didn't know what they were doing
[1:38:47] they only knew that they were led by the
[1:38:49] spirit to do something
[1:38:50] now holding it back in the last days for
[1:38:53] the great revelation
[1:38:55] all of this is laying in the scriptures
[1:38:57] so that a prophet could come and pick it
[1:38:59] up and say
[1:39:00] this is that this is that this is that
[1:39:02] this is that
[1:39:04] didn't even understand why they were
[1:39:06] going through what they were going
[1:39:07] through and doing what they were doing
[1:39:09] but they were portraying christ so that
[1:39:11] when christ was come
[1:39:12] you could look back at the bible and say
[1:39:14] that's right that happened the most
[1:39:15] that's right to happen to joseph that's
[1:39:17] right that happened to david
[1:39:22] oh friends this is about to get fun
[1:39:27] just hang on pinch yourself wake up
[1:39:30] stand and shout wave your arms spin
[1:39:32] about whatever you got to do
[1:39:34] we're about to turn a corner here
[1:39:39] all those things typed him
[1:39:44] but they were holding it back in the
[1:39:47] last days for the great revelation but
[1:39:49] expressing it expressing himself in
[1:39:50] moses
[1:39:51] and david and joseph and elijah and on
[1:39:54] down through
[1:39:55] we could take each one of these prophets
[1:39:57] and bring their lives out and show it
[1:39:58] expresses jesus christ perfectly
[1:40:01] exactly yet never giving his secret and
[1:40:04] full
[1:40:05] waiting for for to make it known in the
[1:40:07] last days as he promised waiting for it
[1:40:09] to be fully comprehended
[1:40:11] see before he could express it if he
[1:40:13] told the whole thing
[1:40:14] what's brother graham talking about he's
[1:40:15] talking about the seventh seal
[1:40:18] he's talking about it hasn't been
[1:40:20] expressed it hasn't been made known
[1:40:22] it's been silenced it hasn't been told
[1:40:24] about amen but it's been expressed in
[1:40:26] every type
[1:40:27] in every character and all through the
[1:40:29] bible and the whole thing is expressing
[1:40:31] this great mystery that god has had in
[1:40:34] his mind
[1:40:34] the threefold purpose the seventh seal
[1:40:37] the coming of the lord
[1:40:39] it's all the same thing and he's
[1:40:41] expressing it all through the bible
[1:40:43] expressing it in moses expressing it in
[1:40:45] david expressing it in joseph
[1:40:48] so that in the end time a prophet of god
[1:40:50] could pick it up and show it
[1:40:52] and say i take the entire bible
[1:40:55] for my text all right keep going
[1:41:02] he never give a secret and full waiting
[1:41:04] for him to make known in the last days
[1:41:06] as he promised
[1:41:07] waiting for it to be fully comprehended
[1:41:09] see before he could express
[1:41:11] it if he told the whole thing because
[1:41:12] the bible is written in mysteries
[1:41:15] jesus thanked the father for it see that
[1:41:17] it was wrote in mysteries
[1:41:20] hallelujah it's still written in
[1:41:23] mysteries
[1:41:24] but it's not a mystery to the bride the
[1:41:27] mystery has been revealed amen the seals
[1:41:29] have been opened
[1:41:30] the mysterious thing's been unveiled and
[1:41:32] now we can see it
[1:41:35] brother branham said in the message
[1:41:36] spiritual amnesia from 1964
[1:41:38] o soldier of the cross that's been
[1:41:41] shocked
[1:41:41] with so much training so many shocks of
[1:41:45] denomination and creed and things of the
[1:41:47] world
[1:41:47] why don't you just step off for a few
[1:41:49] minutes and go to looking around at the
[1:41:51] bible
[1:41:52] oh hallelujah what a wonderful statement
[1:41:54] friends
[1:41:55] he said all soldier of the cross and
[1:41:58] then he's talking to brothers and
[1:41:59] sisters and denominations and people
[1:42:01] have come through the nominations
[1:42:02] and he's saying you've been shocked with
[1:42:04] so much teaching of denomination and
[1:42:05] creed
[1:42:07] tells put a shock on you and he's
[1:42:08] preaching spiritual amnesia
[1:42:11] they were shocked and a shock that
[1:42:13] caused them spiritual amnesia they
[1:42:15] didn't know who they were
[1:42:16] and he said why don't you take a walk
[1:42:17] through the bible he's talking to people
[1:42:19] who have read the bible their whole
[1:42:21] lives
[1:42:22] but they've never really seen it they've
[1:42:25] seen this verse and this greek and this
[1:42:27] hebrew and that
[1:42:28] verse and they chop it all up they've
[1:42:29] never seen the one great love story
[1:42:31] they've never seen the threefold purpose
[1:42:33] they've never seen the seventh seal
[1:42:35] they've seen a book called ruth and they
[1:42:37] saw a book called job and they saw
[1:42:39] a book called this and that was the
[1:42:41] exodus but the exodus has nothing to do
[1:42:43] with
[1:42:46] he said won't you just take a walk
[1:42:47] through the bible a little bit
[1:42:50] he's telling a story about a man that
[1:42:51] was coming back i think from world war
[1:42:53] one
[1:42:53] and he got shell-shocked in the war and
[1:42:55] he forgot who he was and
[1:42:57] he was going through france on a train
[1:42:59] and and there was guards there watching
[1:43:01] them because they would wander off
[1:43:02] and this man gets off the train and and
[1:43:04] all of a sudden
[1:43:05] he has a funny look on his face man
[1:43:08] didn't know who he was didn't know who
[1:43:09] his parents were didn't know what his
[1:43:10] name was
[1:43:10] didn't know where he grew up didn't know
[1:43:12] anything about his past
[1:43:14] he was just living in the present that's
[1:43:17] how we were before the word came to us
[1:43:19] just living in the present just living
[1:43:21] for the now
[1:43:22] not knowing anything and i said he gets
[1:43:25] off the train
[1:43:26] and the train disembarked in his old
[1:43:27] hometown
[1:43:29] and he looks around and he begins to
[1:43:32] scratch his head
[1:43:33] and something begins to stir inside of
[1:43:35] him
[1:43:36] memories he didn't know he had
[1:43:40] feelings that he felt so long ago
[1:43:43] he begins to walk around and and as as
[1:43:46] revelation takes off in recognition of
[1:43:48] where he's at because
[1:43:49] he begins to move faster and faster goes
[1:43:51] to the end of town
[1:43:52] he turns right here and he goes down and
[1:43:54] he catches a path and he goes down the
[1:43:56] path and it leads him right up
[1:43:58] to an old front porch with an old man
[1:44:01] sitting on the porch
[1:44:02] and that was his home and that was his
[1:44:04] daddy and he said son i knew you'd come
[1:44:06] back
[1:44:07] i knew you would come back amen the
[1:44:10] familiarity
[1:44:11] of walking in his hometown and walking
[1:44:13] down old paths it began to break his
[1:44:15] spiritual amnesia and that's why brother
[1:44:17] bam said won't you go walking around the
[1:44:19] bible a little bit
[1:44:20] and let it break your spiritual amnesia
[1:44:22] but don't read it with intellect don't
[1:44:24] read it
[1:44:24] the way the denominations read the bible
[1:44:27] don't take a seminary idea we said i
[1:44:28] don't have a seminary idea
[1:44:30] i grew up in the message if you use your
[1:44:32] own reasoning and intellect it's a
[1:44:33] seminary idea
[1:44:36] if you say that word that bible means
[1:44:38] that and it can only mean that then
[1:44:40] you're stuck in the intellect
[1:44:44] brother said every prophecy has a
[1:44:46] natural and spiritual type
[1:44:48] and multiple fulfillments
[1:44:52] just let the prophet tell us what it
[1:44:53] means
[1:44:56] he says step off for a few minutes and
[1:44:58] go to looking around at the bible
[1:45:00] might wander around and you might find
[1:45:02] yourself
[1:45:03] identified here in the word
[1:45:07] as a believer one of these days you
[1:45:10] might find your identification in here
[1:45:13] how can i find my this was written long
[1:45:15] time ago about other people it wasn't
[1:45:17] written about me
[1:45:19] spiritual amnesia that what happened in
[1:45:22] the old testament doesn't have anything
[1:45:24] to do with the new testament church
[1:45:25] spiritual amnesia amen we're supposed to
[1:45:27] look around here until we find
[1:45:28] our identification in the bible
[1:45:32] our identity is in here amen all about
[1:45:35] us is in here
[1:45:40] he said you might not know him you may
[1:45:42] come to yourself like the prodigal
[1:45:44] son did and find yourself you might find
[1:45:46] your identification
[1:45:48] in the words of god so just for a few
[1:45:51] minutes before we close
[1:45:52] i want to take a little walk through the
[1:45:54] bible brother branham comes and the
[1:45:56] christ is the mystery of god
[1:45:58] revealed and he begins to show that that
[1:46:00] every type
[1:46:01] every character was showing this
[1:46:04] threefold purpose and
[1:46:05] showing christ so he shows him he shows
[1:46:07] the life of moses types it with christ
[1:46:09] the life of joseph types it with christ
[1:46:10] amen then he goes and he shows the life
[1:46:12] of david and he types it with christ
[1:46:14] and he starts to show the mystery of the
[1:46:16] first fold of the threefold purpose was
[1:46:18] laying in that bible all along
[1:46:21] you believe that the mystery of the
[1:46:23] first fold to get preeminence in a man
[1:46:24] he'd been working all through the
[1:46:26] prophets and all that building up like
[1:46:27] the legs the feet the head all the way
[1:46:28] coming to the head when jesus christ
[1:46:30] himself would come
[1:46:31] and cap that old testament body that's
[1:46:33] what the prophet tells us
[1:46:35] amen it was building up and he starts to
[1:46:37] show it and then so he shows the first
[1:46:39] fold of the threefold purpose
[1:46:41] and all the types but the mystery is
[1:46:45] he's also showing the second fold of the
[1:46:49] threefold purpose
[1:46:50] and all the types
[1:46:53] moses got married didn't he
[1:46:57] did he marry a jew he married a gentile
[1:47:02] moses as he's walking through and
[1:47:04] manifesting christ
[1:47:05] by his is a gentile bride
[1:47:10] the second fold of the threefold purpose
[1:47:12] is walking right through the scriptures
[1:47:14] as moses is unfolding the life of christ
[1:47:16] zipporah is there
[1:47:17] manifesting the bride of jesus christ
[1:47:20] everywhere you go in every christ type
[1:47:23] amen has a gentile bride he talks about
[1:47:25] joseph
[1:47:25] amen joseph he's separated from his
[1:47:28] brothers in the separation from the jews
[1:47:30] amen he goes into the gentiles
[1:47:32] and while he's there he gets asanath
[1:47:34] amen who's a gentile
[1:47:36] bride so joseph gets a gentile bride
[1:47:39] and before joseph can present himself to
[1:47:41] his brothers he sends his bride to the
[1:47:43] palace
[1:47:44] and then he sends her away so that he
[1:47:46] can reveal himself to the 144 thousand
[1:47:48] so all through the scriptures is not
[1:47:51] just
[1:47:51] jesus christ the man but also christ the
[1:47:54] bride is right there beside him in every
[1:47:57] story
[1:47:57] and every type marching right through
[1:48:00] when he shows himself as the kinsmen
[1:48:01] redeemer in the book of rome you see
[1:48:03] boaz
[1:48:04] and in boaz you see christ but in ruth
[1:48:06] you see the gentile bride
[1:48:07] [Applause]

[1:48:22] same place amen even abraham
[1:48:24] had to marry a woman that came from the
[1:48:26] same father
[1:48:28] because jesus christ is marrying a woman
[1:48:30] that comes from the same father
[1:48:32] when he's looking for a son amen for
[1:48:34] isaac he sends his
[1:48:35] he sends his servant eliezer which is a
[1:48:37] type of brother branham sends them back

[1:48:46] woman does is type the bride
[1:48:48] she waters tin camels amen those camels
[1:48:50] are the message that packs her to her

[1:48:58] comes all the way back amen and meets
[1:49:00] isaac
[1:49:02] between home and the place she left she
[1:49:04] meets him in the field
[1:49:05] just like the meeting in the air
[1:49:09] you see it wasn't just jesus christ
[1:49:13] that would come in the form of a man
[1:49:14] that was manifest to the old testament
[1:49:17] the bride of christ is laying through
[1:49:19] the entire old testament
[1:49:21] if you look you'll see her she's there
[1:49:25] she's there with moses she's there with
[1:49:26] joseph she's there with david

[1:49:39] and out of there he's married to to
[1:49:41] abigail
[1:49:42] and abigail a man is going to be rescued
[1:49:45] from her first
[1:49:46] marriage she was married wrong
[1:49:49] married to the full because we come to
[1:49:50] this earth buried wrong
[1:49:52] married to the full married to the first
[1:49:54] nature but she's going to be rescued
[1:49:56] when she recognizes the prophecy and the
[1:49:58] day that she lives at and
[1:49:59] speaks it to david she goes back and she
[1:50:03] tells neighbor all that old husband
[1:50:04] this is what i've done i've accepted the
[1:50:06] word of the hour
[1:50:09] and god kills nabal and
[1:50:12] david sends down and marries her
[1:50:15] and then david has a son by her
[1:50:18] and that second son his name means
[1:50:22] like his father
[1:50:26] what did she do she brought forth the
[1:50:29] image of
[1:50:30] her husband what's the bride to do
[1:50:33] to manifest christ again what did
[1:50:35] abigail do she manifest david again
[1:50:37] because the very name of the child means
[1:50:39] like his father
[1:50:41] see brother branham in christ mr god

[1:51:01] preeminence and a man preeminence of the

[1:51:14] he laid him down took out the
[1:51:15] ingredients for the wife took the wife
[1:51:17] out amen there was a time that the wife
[1:51:18] was standing there how long we have no
[1:51:20] idea
[1:51:21] but adam was asleep because he had to
[1:51:23] raise adam up to join the two together
[1:51:25] so the woman was here adam was asleep
[1:51:27] and if somebody would come up and say
[1:51:28] what is this who is this
[1:51:32] the only answer you could give is adam
[1:51:36] because god never named this being god
[1:51:39] never named this figure
[1:51:40] it was adam who called her woman and it
[1:51:42] was adam who called her eve
[1:51:44] god called her adam
[1:51:48] he didn't give her a title he didn't
[1:51:49] give her a name her
[1:51:51] name your name was her identity and her
[1:51:54] identity was where she came from
[1:51:56] and this bride has come out of the side

[1:52:28] thing

[1:52:49] how many more do we have to mention till
[1:52:51] we realize that this old testament was
[1:52:53] prophesying of you and i standing here
[1:52:55] today
[1:52:56] that's why i say to you search the
[1:52:58] scriptures
[1:52:59] in them you think you have eternal life
[1:53:01] but they are they that speak of
[1:53:03] us the bride we're there in the bible
[1:53:05] just the same as jesus christ was there
[1:53:07] in the scriptures
[1:53:08] the bride of jesus christ is laying
[1:53:10] there right next to him
[1:53:12] every time brother branham points
[1:53:14] there's a bride right there
[1:53:17] everything you point to say there's
[1:53:19] christ there but there's his bride there
[1:53:20] too
[1:53:20] there's christ there there's his bride
[1:53:22] there too there's christ there there's
[1:53:23] his bride there too hallelujah
[1:53:26] everywhere you look it's there we open
[1:53:29] up the new testament matthew first book
[1:53:31] of the bible
[1:53:32] first thing you do is go into the
[1:53:33] genealogies of jesus christ
[1:53:35] and there you'll find four women
[1:53:38] tamar gentile
[1:53:41] rahab gentile
[1:53:45] ruth gentile and then it doesn't say
[1:53:49] bathsheba
[1:53:50] says the wife of uriah and uriah was a
[1:53:54] hittite
[1:53:57] what's happening he's opening up the new
[1:54:00] testament
[1:54:01] and he's laying in there the mystery of
[1:54:03] the bride in chapter one
[1:54:08] and we've come to the end of time it's
[1:54:10] been laying there it's a secret he never
[1:54:12] let it be known
[1:54:13] he just laid it in the bible in a
[1:54:15] mysterious secret way
[1:54:17] and you say you're making something of
[1:54:18] it i'm preaching the same way the
[1:54:20] prophet preached
[1:54:22] laying that mystery in the bible because
[1:54:24] you can't add one word to it you can't
[1:54:25] take one word from it
[1:54:28] laying in the bible and you come down to
[1:54:30] our day and he's taken the veil off of
[1:54:32] it and now you can see
[1:54:34] i know why it was rahab i know why it
[1:54:36] was tamar
[1:54:37] i know why it was ruth i know why it was
[1:54:39] bathsheba
[1:54:42] and then as soon as he finishes the
[1:54:43] genealogies as soon as
[1:54:45] immediately when he's done with the
[1:54:46] genealogies
[1:54:49] he said there was a virgin named mary
[1:54:52] what's the new testament telling us
[1:54:55] jesus christ fulfilled the old testament
[1:54:59] now something's happening this new
[1:55:02] testament brother brahman said
[1:55:03] what is the word bride the new testament
[1:55:05] that's all
[1:55:07] he is the old testament she's the new
[1:55:09] testament
[1:55:10] bridegroom and bride united together
[1:55:14] now the apostle paul can come now and
[1:55:16] say
[1:55:17] for this cause a man shall leave his
[1:55:19] father and mother amen
[1:55:20] be joined to his wife and they too shall
[1:55:22] be one flesh
[1:55:23] and he says i speak a great mystery
[1:55:28] this is a great mystery what do you mean
[1:55:30] a mystery
[1:55:31] we've always known that a man leaves his
[1:55:33] father they get married to become one
[1:55:34] flesh that's not mystery that's all the
[1:55:36] way back in genesis we've known that for
[1:55:38] thousands of years
[1:55:39] but paul is taking what's been laying in
[1:55:41] the word for thousands of years
[1:55:42] and he's going to bring it up to date
[1:55:44] and bring a revelation out of the word
[1:55:46] that has been written for thousands of
[1:55:48] years
[1:55:49] he says but i speak to you a great
[1:55:52] mystery
[1:55:54] concerning christ and his bride that
[1:55:56] story all the way back there
[1:55:58] adam and the woman and cleaving that's
[1:56:00] really the seventh seal unfolding
[1:56:02] that's really the mystery laying there
[1:56:04] in a mysterious way
[1:56:05] it's in plain view everybody can see it
[1:56:08] but without eyes to see
[1:56:09] you can't see it jesus was walking with
[1:56:12] those two on the road to a mass
[1:56:14] everybody could walk by could see the
[1:56:15] third man
[1:56:17] but who's the third man everybody can

[1:58:23] represents who the woman of the well
[1:58:25] represents

[1:59:13] mystery talks about the threefold
[1:59:14] purpose and takes for his text
[1:59:16] the entire bible

[2:00:51] those same scriptures that testify to
[2:00:53] christ are the same ones that testify
[2:00:55] to us let's
[2:00:59] let's finish by going to mark 16.
[2:01:05] we'll finish it up here
[2:01:14] mark 16 and 9.
[2:01:21] mark 16 9 says and now when jesus was
[2:01:24] risen early the first day of the week he
[2:01:26] appeared first to mary magdalene
[2:01:28] out of whom he had cast seven devils and
[2:01:30] she went and told them
[2:01:32] what had been that that had been with
[2:01:34] him as they mourned and wept
[2:01:36] and they when they had heard that it was
[2:01:38] that he was alive
[2:01:40] and it's been seen of her believed
[2:01:43] not
[2:01:46] verse 12 after that he appeared in
[2:01:49] another
[2:01:50] form in another form
[2:01:54] unto two of them as they walked and went
[2:01:56] into the country
[2:01:57] and they went and told it unto the
[2:01:58] residue neither believe they
[2:02:02] them it doesn't matter how
[2:02:06] how much he reveals the word to them
[2:02:09] how much they can say about the
[2:02:11] scriptures that was unfolded
[2:02:12] because they didn't see his nail prints
[2:02:15] they didn't believe their testimony
[2:02:17] i saw him how did you see him oh he was
[2:02:20] in another form it wasn't the one that
[2:02:22] we saw
[2:02:23] it wasn't the one we were in the boat
[2:02:24] with it wasn't the one that we ate with
[2:02:26] it was another form but it was him just
[2:02:28] the same
[2:02:30] i don't know about that i won't believe
[2:02:32] it until i stick my finger
[2:02:36] jewish
[2:02:40] blessed is he who doesn't see
[2:02:43] and yet believes
[2:02:52] we're starting again they went and told
[2:02:53] it into the residue neither believed
[2:02:55] they them
[2:02:56] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as
[2:02:58] they sat at meat and unbraided them with
[2:03:00] their unbelief
[2:03:01] and hardness of heart because they
[2:03:03] believed not
[2:03:05] when he believed not them which he had
[2:03:07] seen him after he was risen
[2:03:09] who did they see him
[2:03:13] not in the same form they saw him in a
[2:03:16] different form
[2:03:17] and when they didn't believe them
[2:03:19] because it was a different form
[2:03:20] then jesus comes and he rebukes them
[2:03:23] for their hardness of heart they're
[2:03:26] living by the head not by the heart
[2:03:28] because their heart would tell them it's
[2:03:29] true
[2:03:31] but that old carnal thinking that old
[2:03:33] mind of man
[2:03:34] would limit what the heart knows to be
[2:03:36] true already
[2:03:37] amen we gotta have the mind of christ
[2:03:39] and let the heart and then let what god
[2:03:41] placed within us before the foundation
[2:03:43] of the world
[2:03:44] let faith rise up out of the heart and
[2:03:46] say that's true
[2:03:51] in acts 9 the apostle paul
[2:03:55] he's walking every riding or whatever
[2:03:57] he's doing on the road to damascus amen
[2:03:59] and he goes along and all of a sudden
[2:04:00] there's a bright light that appears
[2:04:02] and he and he says here in verse 3
[2:04:06] and as he journeyed he came near
[2:04:07] damascus and suddenly they're shined
[2:04:08] around about him a light from heaven
[2:04:10] and he fell to the earth and heard a
[2:04:11] voice saying unto him now brother bram
[2:04:13] said it was the pillar of fire
[2:04:16] hear the voice saying unto him sauce all
[2:04:18] why persecute us thou me
[2:04:20] and he said who art thou lord and he
[2:04:22] said i
[2:04:24] am jesus
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:27] i am jesus he wasn't
[2:04:30] even in a flesh body he was a light
[2:04:34] he was a pillar of fire and the pillar
[2:04:36] of fire now was talking
[2:04:37] and the pillar of fire said i am
[2:04:41] jesus and brother brethren said we've
[2:04:42] come to the day amen where the holy
[2:04:44] ghost has been bound for nearly two
[2:04:46] thousand years
[2:04:47] by creeds and dominance but have been
[2:04:48] loose in the evening time by the evening
[2:04:50] time message the holy ghost back in the
[2:04:52] people again
[2:04:53] and he says the pillar of fire back in
[2:04:55] the church
[2:04:56] what was the pillar of fire jesus said
[2:04:59] it is
[2:05:00] jesus i am jesus
[2:05:04] not jesus part two not jesus half
[2:05:08] not jesus light but i am
[2:05:11] jesus this light that you're looking at
[2:05:13] i don't see nail prints i don't see the
[2:05:15] body on the cross
[2:05:16] forget the body on the cross he said i
[2:05:19] am
[2:05:20] jesus
[2:05:22] [Applause]
[2:05:24] the pillar of fire identified itself
[2:05:28] and brother branham tells us where the
[2:05:29] pillar of fire is now where's the pillar
[2:05:31] of fire
[2:05:32] in the bride
[2:05:34] [Applause]
[2:05:36] so where's jesus we're sitting here and
[2:05:39] one day he'll get up
[2:05:40] my goodness read the bible
[2:05:44] believe the word amen the body can sit
[2:05:47] in the sanctuary of god but his personal
[2:05:49] presence can come
[2:05:50] and he can say i am jesus without the
[2:05:53] nail print body
[2:05:55] it was the same lord jesus christ
[2:05:59] talking to the apostle paul
[2:06:04] and furthermore he says why are you
[2:06:07] persecuting me
[2:06:10] why are you persecuting me who are you
[2:06:14] paul as far as we know never laid a
[2:06:17] finger
[2:06:18] on jesus in his earthly body
[2:06:22] jesus of nazareth as far as we know he
[2:06:25] never had any physical contact
[2:06:27] but who was he persecuting he was
[2:06:30] persecuting the church
[2:06:33] and jesus didn't say why do you
[2:06:34] persecute my church
[2:06:37] he didn't say why do you persecute my
[2:06:40] bride
[2:06:40] [Applause]
[2:06:42] he said why do you persecute
[2:06:45] me
[2:06:50] who are you lord who is it i'm
[2:06:53] persecuting
[2:06:55] where was the light ye are the light of
[2:06:58] the world
[2:07:00] the light is in you you are the light
[2:07:04] now that light is shining and blinding
[2:07:06] paul by the light
[2:07:07] the same light that was in the bride the
[2:07:09] same light he was persecuting he was
[2:07:11] touching
[2:07:12] flesh it wasn't the flesh he was
[2:07:13] referring to
[2:07:15] it was the light on the inside
[2:07:18] why are you persecuting me who are you
[2:07:20] lord
[2:07:21] i am jesus
[2:07:26] whom you persecute
[2:07:30] that means when paul was going down
[2:07:31] there and he broke up a house meeting
[2:07:33] and he was arresting a woman and he
[2:07:35] grabbed a little child
[2:07:36] amen and he had his people grabbing
[2:07:38] soldiers grabbed the husband and he
[2:07:39] handcuffed them all together and leading
[2:07:40] them away
[2:07:41] he was persecuting jesus
[2:07:45] because jesus was in another form
[2:07:48] a form that he did not recognize but the
[2:07:51] revelation on the road to damascus began
[2:07:54] to identify who it was he was arresting
[2:07:57] he was persecuting jesus christ
[2:08:01] in another body
[2:08:05] praise god that's the word of god
[2:08:10] let's go to second john
[2:08:15] we are winding down we are wrapping up
[2:08:20] we are
[2:08:23] i hope we are believing the word
[2:08:27] how does that make sense i don't know go
[2:08:29] back and talk like nicodemus if you want
[2:08:31] to talk like nicodemus
[2:08:33] do i have to go back into the womb are
[2:08:35] you son of man here
[2:08:37] i don't want to talk like nicodemus i
[2:08:39] want to answer like peter
[2:08:41] they are christ the son of the living
[2:08:43] god how did you know that i haven't got
[2:08:44] a clue how i knew that
[2:08:46] i just know it it wasn't my teaching it
[2:08:49] wasn't i
[2:08:50] i mean he was ignorant and unlearned
[2:08:51] brother branham said he couldn't even
[2:08:53] sign his own name couldn't even read he
[2:08:54] wasn't pulling out the scroll and saying
[2:08:56] it's right there
[2:08:57] it was something in peter that could
[2:08:59] identify that that's nothing but the
[2:09:01] truth what was it in hattie right
[2:09:03] humble humble humble woman where could
[2:09:06] she go to the scriptures and where could
[2:09:07] she pull it up
[2:09:08] and say a voice of god one day is going
[2:09:10] to talk into the woods into a prophet
[2:09:12] and he's going to say make whatever you
[2:09:13] want and that prophet is going to say
[2:09:15] i want three squirrels and coming from
[2:09:16] here and here she had zero
[2:09:18] scriptures zero
[2:09:21] scriptures and when brother bam told the
[2:09:25] story she said that ain't nothing
[2:09:26] but the truth and
[2:09:30] god loved it so much that she would say
[2:09:33] that
[2:09:34] with no scriptures
[2:09:38] but was it god it was nothing but god
[2:09:43] and she had something in her could
[2:09:44] recognize what that prophet saying
[2:09:46] is nothing but the truth what scripture
[2:09:50] are you referencing hattie
[2:09:51] i don't know where did you hear that
[2:09:55] before i've never heard it before
[2:09:57] how do you know it's true i don't know
[2:10:00] but i know it's nothing but the truth
[2:10:03] and god so loved it he told the prophet
[2:10:06] to stand on his feet
[2:10:07] and he told him he says whatever you ask
[2:10:11] for do you realize how much god
[2:10:15] loved what that woman said whatever
[2:10:19] you asked for
[2:10:22] he gave her the power to change the
[2:10:25] entire universe
[2:10:28] brother baby said whatever you say
[2:10:31] whatever you ask for if you haven't got
[2:10:34] it
[2:10:35] instantly he goes i'm a false prophet a
[2:10:38] million dollars it'll be in your life
[2:10:39] whatever you want healing of your sister
[2:10:42] whatever you want
[2:10:47] god's not trying to get us to figure
[2:10:49] something out
[2:10:51] dissect something learn something start
[2:10:53] a new message seminary
[2:10:55] he wants people who can catch the
[2:10:57] revelation of the hour they're living in
[2:10:59] and recognize that's nothing but the
[2:11:02] truth
[2:11:04] how do you know i don't i believe
[2:11:10] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[2:11:12] blood
[2:11:14] that's a hard saying but what if and the
[2:11:16] son of man showed a sin where he came
[2:11:17] from before
[2:11:19] many of them left him turns to his
[2:11:21] disciples will you go also peter says
[2:11:24] where are we going to go
[2:11:26] i can't even read the bible
[2:11:30] where are we going to go i've never had
[2:11:32] theological training
[2:11:34] i can't even read the bible all i know
[2:11:37] is fishing nets and fishing and
[2:11:38] and all i know is when the moon rises
[2:11:40] full on an overcast day
[2:11:42] there'll be a good spot out there the
[2:11:44] fish that's all i know about
[2:11:46] all i know is stitching in that all i
[2:11:48] know is survival
[2:11:49] i don't know anything other than that
[2:11:51] where else are we going to go
[2:11:53] you alone have the words of eternal life
[2:11:57] where else are we going to go to matthew
[2:12:00] henry's commentary
[2:12:01] we're going to go charles spurgeon's
[2:12:03] writing the message has the word of god
[2:12:05] i don't know anything else
[2:12:07] all i know is bending nets and trying to
[2:12:09] survive and making a paycheck
[2:12:10] all i've ever known all my life is how
[2:12:12] to get through school and how to get
[2:12:14] some money and buy some groceries and
[2:12:15] raise some babies and change some
[2:12:16] diapers how are we going to figure it
[2:12:18] out
[2:12:20] not by intellect friends
[2:12:23] but something something on the inside
[2:12:28] was there before the foundation of the
[2:12:30] world
[2:12:31] that same thing that was in hattie right
[2:12:33] the same thing brother branham the same
[2:12:35] thing in paul the apostle
[2:12:36] the same thing and you and i
[2:12:40] can say that's nothing but the truth
[2:12:43] figure it out all right no way
[2:12:46] write you a bible study i'd be lost
[2:12:48] before i got started
[2:12:50] but it's truth i know it's truth
[2:12:54] that doesn't mean god doesn't want to
[2:12:55] reveal it doesn't mean he won't show it
[2:12:56] out of his word everything comes out of
[2:12:57] the word
[2:12:59] but it doesn't come out of an
[2:13:00] intellectual understanding of the word
[2:13:03] jesus didn't bring it intellectually
[2:13:05] they had all the intellect in the world
[2:13:06] they had the whole bible figured out yes
[2:13:09] the day jesus was here and he would pull
[2:13:11] scriptures out and apply it to his day
[2:13:13] and they'd be like
[2:13:14] how i mean when he was 12 years old they
[2:13:16] were astonished at his teaching
[2:13:18] how can he put these things how can he
[2:13:20] handle the word that way
[2:13:22] because he is the word
[2:13:25] second john 1 7.
[2:13:31] for many deceivers are entered into the
[2:13:33] world who confess not that jesus christ
[2:13:36] is come in
[2:13:40] the flesh
[2:13:43] has come
[2:13:46] will come
[2:13:50] is come
[2:13:53] when jesus was in the pillar of fire
[2:13:56] talking to the apostle paul
[2:13:59] he said why you persecute me
[2:14:03] paul was persecuting flesh
[2:14:06] who's flesh jesus is flesh
[2:14:11] he said why do you persecute me
[2:14:15] he was living as a son of god and the
[2:14:18] holy ghost
[2:14:19] in that little church
[2:14:23] let's read this again verse 7 for many
[2:14:25] deceivers are entered into the world
[2:14:27] who confess not that jesus christ
[2:14:30] is come in the flesh
[2:14:35] this is a deceiver and an antichrist
[2:14:40] that scripture applies just the same
[2:14:42] today
[2:14:43] as it did the day it was written brother
[2:14:46] branham says in the rising of the sun
[2:14:48] that's that divine revelation of the
[2:14:51] word made flesh
[2:14:52] the divine revelation the word made
[2:14:54] flesh it was flesh and that day by the
[2:14:56] sun the groom
[2:14:57] it is fleshed today by the bride
[2:15:01] the invisible union of the bride of
[2:15:02] christ he says in jesus the word took my
[2:15:05] place
[2:15:06] he became me that a sinner that i might
[2:15:08] become him the word amen
[2:15:10] let me hold true to it not to the church
[2:15:12] the word amen
[2:15:13] oh that spiritual union of christ in his
[2:15:16] church now
[2:15:17] when the flesh is becoming word and the
[2:15:20] word
[2:15:21] is becoming flesh
[2:15:26] manifested vindicated just what the
[2:15:28] bible said would happen in this day
[2:15:30] it's happening day by day
[2:15:33] how many can say it's happening day by
[2:15:35] day the flesh is becoming the word and
[2:15:38] the word is becoming flesh
[2:15:39] and anyone that will deny that jesus
[2:15:42] christ is
[2:15:43] come in the flesh is a deceiver and an
[2:15:46] antichrist he will come in the flesh no
[2:15:49] he's come in the flesh right now
[2:15:51] in the flesh of his bride in your flesh
[2:15:54] in my flesh don't deny the lord don't
[2:15:57] deny what he told paul
[2:15:58] don't deny the scriptures
[2:16:01] just believe it how does it all work
[2:16:04] what's the chemistry and the mechanics
[2:16:05] and who's where how much this and
[2:16:07] who cares just believe the word
[2:16:11] believe the prophet believe the message
[2:16:14] he says he's here
[2:16:18] jesus part two jesus light or is it
[2:16:21] jesus christ himself
[2:16:23] manifest in the flesh the flesh of his
[2:16:27] church
[2:16:29] we know that body's coming the same one
[2:16:32] that was nailed to the cross we'll see
[2:16:34] it
[2:16:34] and we'll worship him in that form it's
[2:16:37] that form that it receives eternal
[2:16:38] worship in
[2:16:39] and we long to see it but i'm not
[2:16:43] waiting till i see that to believe that
[2:16:44] he's here
[2:16:46] or to believe that he's come in our day
[2:16:49] because i can see him right here
[2:16:52] i can see him all around me in the
[2:16:54] manifestation of the hour
[2:16:55] and everything that's taken place is
[2:16:57] pointing to the same thing
[2:16:58] bible days are here again we're living
[2:17:02] this word out this word is flesh now
[2:17:04] in a mini-membered body the flesh of
[2:17:07] jesus christ

[2:18:37] not fit to understand your revelation to
[2:18:39] grasp what you're doing in this day
[2:18:42] we're just as unfit lord as all they
[2:18:44] were that were in jerusalem when you
[2:18:46] were there
[2:18:47] when you were gone up to the temple to
[2:18:49] worship and you began to preach lord
[2:18:52] god there was some that could believe
[2:18:55] there was some that would reason and not
[2:18:57] understand
[2:18:58] but lord forgive us for relying on the
[2:19:00] wrong kind of understanding
[2:19:03] let us rely lord on that faith that
[2:19:05] you've put inside of us
