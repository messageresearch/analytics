[4:40] mercedes
[4:43] i should have fallen in
[4:48] my soul cast down mercy
[5:02] hallelujah praise the lord aren't you
[5:05] glad mercy rewrote
[5:07] our life and while we're standing let's
[5:09] take our bibles and turn
[5:11] to colossians chapter one and we'll get
[5:13] started right into the word
[5:15] i say god bless you this morning it's
[5:17] good to see you it's good to be here
[5:19] together amen
[5:21] i appreciate every opportunity we have
[5:23] to gather together to worship his name
[5:25] as brothers and sisters
[5:29] now we're going to look at colossians
[5:32] chapter 1 to get started
[5:34] very familiar passage of scripture but
[5:36] it's just
[5:37] one of those things you just can't get
[5:38] away from and it keeps revolving around
[5:41] and around in our hearts again and again
[5:44] and god is continually unveiling himself
[5:46] to us
[5:48] in colossians 1 verse 26 it says
[5:51] even the mystery which has been hid from
[5:53] ages and from generations
[5:55] but now is made manifest to his saints
[5:58] to whom god would make known what is the
[5:59] riches of the glory of this mystery
[6:01] among the gentiles
[6:03] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[6:07] i think we could preach on this every
[6:09] service from now
[6:10] until our life is done on this earth and
[6:14] not probably have touched the bottom of
[6:16] it yet
[6:17] because this is the great mystery this
[6:19] is the mystery
[6:20] and god would make known what is the
[6:22] riches of the glory
[6:24] of this mystery among the gentiles which
[6:27] is
[6:28] christ in you the hope of glory this is
[6:31] the mystery this
[6:32] is uh the mystery which has been hid
[6:34] from ages and from generations
[6:36] but now it's made known to his sin it's
[6:39] the
[6:40] the riches of the glory of this mystery
[6:43] and then when you say it it's like so
[6:45] simple christ knew the hope of glory
[6:46] that's it oh that's it friends that's
[6:50] it all that and more amen it's it's more
[6:53] than i think we've ever realized but i
[6:55] think god wants us to realize and he
[6:56] keeps unfolding it to us
[6:58] so that we can see who he is and who we
[7:00] are in him
[7:02] man let's bow our heads and ask the
[7:03] lord's blessing lord jesus we ask that
[7:05] you would just minister to us lord
[7:08] god that you would just watch over your
[7:10] word
[7:11] or that you would just forgive us for
[7:13] all the faults and failures in life lord
[7:15] and all those things
[7:17] lord that we should have done better but
[7:19] we lay them now at your feet and ask
[7:20] that you'd wash us by the water of the
[7:22] word
[7:23] that you'd move us into that place lord
[7:26] by the sea that you've put in us by the
[7:27] faith you've given us to accept your
[7:29] word
[7:30] would you move us into that place of
[7:31] manifestation you've called us to lord
[7:34] that you might be glorified in us that
[7:36] lord we might finish lord on this earth
[7:38] your purpose that you purposed
[7:40] for us to do while we might yield to you
[7:43] in a greater way that you might have
[7:45] greater preeminence than ever before
[7:47] we ask all you would speak your words
[7:49] into our hearts
[7:50] and lord that you would change us by
[7:52] that word into that image you had of us
[7:54] before the foundation of the world in
[7:56] jesus christ's name we pray
[7:58] amen you can all be seated
[8:03] i'd like to preach if i can take for a
[8:06] title
[8:07] this morning the necessity of the bride
[8:10] the necessity of the bride it's along
[8:13] the lines of what we've been talking
[8:14] about
[8:15] and we'll just see how the lord opens
[8:17] things up for us
[8:19] um as we go along and hopefully connects
[8:22] some things together for us brother
[8:25] graham said in the message the thinking
[8:26] man's filter
[8:27] said notice the word cannot deny itself
[8:31] that's that's fundamental but it's basic
[8:34] but fundamental
[8:35] the word cannot deny itself so if you're
[8:38] the word you cannot deny the word
[8:41] the word cannot deny itself then it is
[8:44] satisfied or it's the desire it's a
[8:46] desire of what
[8:47] what made you desire in the first place
[8:49] because down in your shoulder was a
[8:51] predestinated seed which was eternal
[8:53] life
[8:54] always laying in there always was in
[8:56] there
[8:57] all that the father has given me will
[8:59] come to me there isn't
[9:00] any of them going to be lost and these
[9:02] are the things that we've been talking
[9:04] about
[9:04] amen that by predestination we are
[9:07] secure because we're actually a part of
[9:09] god
[9:10] and from before the foundation of the
[9:12] world and god is not going to lose
[9:14] himself
[9:16] and the seed shall not be heir with the
[9:18] shock in 1965 brother brahm said
[9:21] that's why the rapture the bride the
[9:22] wise virgin
[9:24] that called out the four ordained the
[9:26] elected while you businessmen wouldn't
[9:28] run your office like some people try to
[9:30] think that god runs this program
[9:32] haphazard god knew before the foundation
[9:34] of the world who would be saved
[9:36] and who would not be saved by
[9:37] predestination by four knowledge he saw
[9:40] every member put every name on the
[9:42] lamb's book of life before the church
[9:43] ever began
[9:44] jesus come to seek and to save that
[9:46] which was on the book
[9:48] he bought the book of redemption it was
[9:50] lost and he redeemed us and all names
[9:52] was on that book was redeemed
[9:54] when he redeemed us amen so we find out
[9:57] now that
[9:58] that our life has not been by chance
[10:02] and then our existence here isn't by
[10:04] chance it wasn't the uh
[10:06] fleshly desire the lust of a man and a
[10:09] woman and the desire of a man and a
[10:10] woman
[10:11] to have a child it was the will of god
[10:13] that brought us on this earth
[10:15] and god knew the end from the beginning
[10:18] and god
[10:18] is not learning anything as time goes on
[10:22] but god and god is also not adjusting
[10:25] amen his plan to our plan he's not
[10:29] adjusting his plan
[10:30] to satan's moves amen god already knew
[10:33] what would be and he's working
[10:35] everything according to his plan
[10:37] these are things that we have to remind
[10:38] ourselves all the time because in human
[10:40] flesh in our human mind
[10:42] we get rattled when things don't work
[10:43] out the way we expected them to work and
[10:45] things don't
[10:46] happen the way we planned for them or
[10:47] thought that they would happen
[10:49] and we begin to have to readjust our
[10:52] plans
[10:52] and rethink through some things and
[10:54] realign our thinking
[10:56] but we realize god doesn't have to do
[10:58] that god is not realigning his thinking
[11:00] he's not adjusting he's not waiting for
[11:02] satan to do something and when he does
[11:04] it now he'll decide what he does next
[11:06] amen god's already determined what he's
[11:08] going to do
[11:10] so that gives us a absolute rest
[11:13] and and god spent a lot of time in the
[11:14] message trying to bring us rest and in
[11:16] the word
[11:17] showing us in the scripture what our
[11:19] position in christ actually
[11:20] is amen i want to read a large section
[11:24] here on a smyrnan church age as we lay a
[11:26] foundation
[11:27] so to go on these elect were not only
[11:29] the eternal thoughts of god which were
[11:31] to be expressed in flesh in their due
[11:33] season
[11:34] but these same elect are called by
[11:35] another name romans 4
[11:37] 16 therefore it is of faith that it
[11:39] might be by grace to the end
[11:41] the promise might be sure to all the
[11:43] seed not to that only which is of the
[11:45] law but to that also which is of the
[11:47] faith of abraham
[11:48] who is the father of us all when skip
[11:52] down he reads a few more scriptures but
[11:53] he gets down in the comments on
[11:55] this verse we just read according to
[11:57] romans 4 16 we find that god has
[11:59] given a sure promise to all of abraham
[12:02] seed and paul puts himself in all
[12:05] believers under this designation because
[12:07] he says
[12:08] abraham who is the father of us all
[12:11] then he goes then he goes on to not only
[12:14] narrow down his definition but rather to
[12:17] finalize it for the galatians
[12:19] for in galatians 3 he identified the
[12:22] seed
[12:23] singular with jesus and counted the seed
[12:26] children
[12:26] as children of promise and promises as
[12:29] having to do with election
[12:31] or the choosing of god and that is
[12:33] exactly what we have been saying
[12:35] these who are of the royal seed or the
[12:37] elect of god
[12:38] and are the predestinated foreknown of
[12:41] god and were
[12:42] in the mind of god and his thoughts
[12:45] in very plain language the true bride of
[12:47] christ was in the mind of god eternally
[12:50] though not expressed until each came
[12:52] forth in the designated decrete season
[12:55] as each member came forth it became
[12:57] expressed and took its place in the body
[12:59] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[13:02] word seed bride
[13:05] spoken word see bright just what jesus
[13:07] christ was a spoken word seed
[13:09] amen she is also a spoken word seed he's
[13:12] the spoken word seed
[13:13] bride groom she's a spoken word seed
[13:16] bride
[13:16] [Music]
[13:19] and though she is feminine in
[13:20] designation she is also called the body
[13:23] of christ
[13:24] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[13:26] called that for she was predestinated
[13:28] in him come from the same source was
[13:31] eternal with him
[13:32] and is now manifesting god in a
[13:34] mini-membered body whereas
[13:36] once god was manifest in one member even
[13:39] our lord jesus christ
[13:41] so as god was manifested in one member
[13:44] nobody
[13:44] in christ him will deny amen that he was
[13:47] the fullness of the godhead
[13:48] bodily amen and that he was expressing
[13:51] god in one member
[13:53] that will never be denied that will not
[13:55] be argued about if it is
[13:57] it's not an argument i've ever heard
[13:59] amen but where the
[14:00] rub comes in this day is that whatever
[14:02] that was expressing in that one member
[14:05] is now the same thing expressing in a
[14:07] mini-membered body
[14:09] that's where the rub comes down that's
[14:11] where the mystery is amen that's where
[14:13] the revelation of this hour the word
[14:15] made manifest for this hour the light of
[14:18] the hour
[14:18] amen if you walk in the light as he is
[14:20] in the light this
[14:21] is the current present tense light that
[14:24] whatever was
[14:25] in god amen whatever was in christ amen
[14:29] working and manifesting the word amen
[14:31] that same thing is
[14:33] in a many members what was in one member
[14:35] is now in many member body
[14:37] expressing his word
[14:40] so we don't want to make it two
[14:41] different things amen it's the same
[14:43] thing
[14:45] and when we make it two different things
[14:47] and when we begin to
[14:48] lose the mystery and lose the revelation
[14:51] and obscure what god is doing in this
[14:53] day
[14:56] he said he goes on to say now then here
[14:58] we are coming to a conclusion
[15:00] as the eternal logos god was manifest in
[15:03] the sun
[15:04] and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[15:06] the godhead bodily
[15:07] and that eternal one was the father
[15:09] manifest in flesh
[15:11] and thereby gain the title of son even
[15:14] so we
[15:14] eternal his thoughts in our turn become
[15:17] the many members spoken word seed
[15:20] manifest in flesh and those
[15:23] eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh
[15:25] are the sons of god
[15:28] even as we are so called we did not
[15:30] become seed by the rebirth
[15:32] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[15:36] for
[15:36] only the elect can be reborn
[15:40] because we were seed is the reason we
[15:42] could be quick and
[15:43] in non-seed there is nothing to quicken
[15:47] so we realize we come back to grace
[15:50] because it's god's love it's god
[15:52] portioning himself out
[15:53] it's it's a portion of god a seed a
[15:55] piece of god
[15:56] amen that was inside of us that has the
[15:58] capacity to recognize the light for our
[16:00] day
[16:01] and believe it and by faith we are
[16:03] justified
[16:05] so it's not something that we've done we
[16:07] couldn't do it there was nothing we can
[16:08] do
[16:09] so it takes away the whole concept of
[16:12] mental ability
[16:13] the whole concept of being able to
[16:15] comprehend or understand
[16:17] or or to explain it in such a way to get
[16:20] a mental agreement to say
[16:22] that we have another believer amen the
[16:24] denominations are full of that
[16:26] but that's not what he's looking for
[16:27] he's looking for his lost sheep he's
[16:29] looking for his seed he's looking for
[16:31] his children
[16:32] amen and they have the capacity to
[16:33] receive the word in the light of the
[16:35] hour
[16:36] very simple very very simple
[16:39] amen it's so perfect that he can use a
[16:42] man
[16:43] amen with broken grammar and a seventh
[16:45] grade education who comes out of the
[16:46] hills of kentucky
[16:48] amen it's so perfect this power of
[16:50] revelation and faith that lays in the
[16:52] seat
[16:52] that he didn't choose an outstanding
[16:54] speaker although i thought brother ben
[16:56] was an outstanding speaker
[16:57] but he didn't choose it in one that
[16:59] would have it grammatically correct
[17:01] amen or or one that would be such a
[17:03] skilled teacher
[17:05] that he could lay it out so smooth amen
[17:08] that you could just connect the dots
[17:10] but the way brother branham preached is
[17:12] he would drop something here
[17:13] change subjects and talk about something
[17:15] else amen and move back to the thing he
[17:17] was talking about
[17:18] amen and and what what's he it's almost
[17:21] like what are you doing i don't
[17:22] understand why couldn't you make this
[17:24] easier amen because it's hidden and
[17:26] revealed in simplicity
[17:27] it's hidden from the eyes of the wise
[17:29] and prudent revealed it unto the babes
[17:32] that's how perfect this power of
[17:33] revelation is to the seed because
[17:36] whatever that word is that's being
[17:38] preached there's a matching part inside
[17:40] amen the children of god and the two
[17:42] have a magnetism that attract to one
[17:44] another
[17:46] it's not a coercion amen it's not a
[17:48] group effect
[17:49] amen so many times i see
[17:53] you know somebody many times not always
[17:57] but sometimes you see
[17:58] somebody will become interested in the
[17:59] message and and all of a sudden
[18:01] they'll strike up maybe a friendship
[18:03] with some believers and all of a sudden
[18:04] the people
[18:05] pour it on amen and they think if we
[18:07] could just get them to meet everybody
[18:08] and be
[18:08] friends and everybody friends amen
[18:10] they'll come in they're not going to
[18:11] come in by friendship
[18:15] amen they're not going to come in by
[18:16] friendship i mean that's why many times
[18:18] when
[18:19] when we we this is just a little secret
[18:22] many times we have a visitor or somebody
[18:24] come to the church and they're new i'll
[18:25] leave them alone for a while
[18:28] i'm not to be rude but i don't want a
[18:30] personality to be an attraction
[18:33] i don't want it to be a an overwhelming
[18:35] friendship or
[18:36] or a an extra amount of warmth or
[18:39] pouring on something
[18:40] because the reality is amen if you're
[18:43] going to be in the bride and you're
[18:44] going to be part of any local body
[18:46] amen there's going to be some rough
[18:47] times that come and there's going to be
[18:49] some things that aren't so sweet and so
[18:51] friendly and
[18:51] so easy to manage amen and i want to
[18:53] know if somebody is coming for the word
[18:55] are they coming for friends
[18:59] they're coming for family are they
[19:00] coming for the word amen
[19:02] and so so sometimes not to be rude in
[19:05] any way but sometimes i'll just leave
[19:07] somebody alone for a while
[19:10] because i don't want him to say oh he's
[19:12] so nice he's
[19:13] such a nice they're so nice over there
[19:15] and they're so welcoming and i just feel
[19:17] so welcome and i'm just so
[19:18] we should welcome people please don't
[19:20] misunderstand what i'm saying we should
[19:22] be nice please be nice
[19:23] don't start being rude just to test
[19:25] people i tested him brother chad they
[19:27] weren't a believer
[19:30] please don't do that i got to be careful
[19:33] what i say
[19:36] but you know what when somebody comes to
[19:38] the word and comes for the word
[19:40] it doesn't matter if nobody talks to
[19:42] them that day shakes their hand
[19:43] they may have hurt feelings but they're
[19:44] not leaving the word
[19:47] we want to be friendly we are friendly
[19:49] we're sweet we're loving we're kind
[19:51] amen but that's not the attraction the
[19:53] attraction must be the word
[19:59] and if the words the attraction all else
[20:01] will find its place
[20:04] amen he goes on in the same quote out of
[20:07] the smyrna church age
[20:08] hold this carefully in your mind now
[20:11] take the next step
[20:12] redeem means to buy back it restores
[20:15] to the original owner god by his death
[20:18] the shed blood brought back his own
[20:21] he bought back the spoken word seed
[20:23] bride
[20:24] my sheep hear my voice word word is in
[20:27] parentheses my sheep hear my voice
[20:28] word so if you're going to hear his
[20:30] voice you're going to hear the word
[20:33] my sheep hear my voice word and they
[20:34] follow me you
[20:36] always were a sheep you never were a pig
[20:38] or a dog turned into a sheep
[20:40] that is impossible for every kind of
[20:42] life produces the same kind
[20:44] and there is no change in specie as we
[20:46] were in the thoughts of god and then
[20:48] expressed in flesh
[20:49] there had to come a day when we would
[20:51] hear his voice the word
[20:53] and hearing that voice become aware of
[20:55] our father calling us
[20:57] and recognized that we are the sons of
[21:00] god
[21:00] we heard his voice and we cried out as
[21:03] did the prodigal son
[21:04] save me o my father i'm returning to
[21:07] thee
[21:08] now this is powerful now i i want to
[21:10] look at two scriptures let's go back to
[21:11] genesis chapter 2
[21:13] or i'm sorry genesis chapter 3
[21:18] and the light of what the prophet of god
[21:20] has just said
[21:21] about redemption and
[21:25] redeeming restoring bringing back to its
[21:28] original
[21:28] owner my sheep hear my voice amen the
[21:31] word
[21:32] amen my sheep hear my voice the word and
[21:35] hearing the voice they become aware of
[21:37] their father calling
[21:39] amen when they hear that word it's
[21:41] there's a familiarity there's a shepherd
[21:44] there's a father
[21:45] calling his child back home
[21:48] so and it says and then brother man says
[21:52] we've heard his voice and we cried out
[21:53] as did the prodigal son
[21:54] save me or my father i'm returning to
[21:57] thee now i want to contrast that with
[21:59] genesis chapter 3. let's go to
[22:03] verse 7. and the eyes of them both were
[22:07] open
[22:07] and they knew that they were naked and
[22:09] they sowed fig leaves together and made
[22:10] themselves aprons
[22:13] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[22:14] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[22:16] day
[22:17] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[22:19] from the presence of the lord
[22:22] of the lord god amongst the trees of the
[22:24] garden and the lord god called unto adam
[22:26] and said unto him where art thou
[22:28] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[22:30] garden and i was afraid because i was
[22:31] naked
[22:32] and i hid myself so here
[22:36] after god has has reformed the earth
[22:38] formed a garden of eden placed his son
[22:40] and his son's wife
[22:42] adam male and female in the garden then
[22:45] they fail they fall by
[22:47] not keeping the word he fell by
[22:49] disbelieving the word
[22:50] and adam fell by not keeping the word
[22:53] he didn't disbelieve it he knew what he
[22:55] was doing he went out with his
[22:56] hit with his wife he chose to to save
[22:59] her
[23:00] and now he he makes himself an apron of
[23:03] fig leaves to cover
[23:05] for his sin amen and now we realize that
[23:08] this is the start of religion because
[23:11] religion means a covering
[23:12] and when he covered his sin in fig
[23:14] leaves he started the first religion
[23:17] that was ever upon the earth
[23:20] but in his in his conscience he knows
[23:23] that his religion's not working
[23:25] because he may have been trying to
[23:27] convince eve
[23:29] and eve may have been trying to convince
[23:31] adam because they both had the aprons on
[23:34] and they now have were covering their
[23:35] sins amen but there was one person they
[23:38] couldn't hide from behind a fig
[23:40] an apron of fig leaves and in verse 8
[23:43] says and they heard the voice of the
[23:45] lord god
[23:45] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[23:48] day
[23:50] so they heard the voice walking
[23:53] they didn't see god walking they heard
[23:56] the voice
[23:57] walking amen
[24:00] they heard his voice i've heard a voice
[24:02] walking in this day
[24:04] come walking amen and now
[24:08] they hid themselves because they
[24:09] realized their religion wasn't going to
[24:11] work
[24:13] and and god called unto adam and said
[24:16] unto him where art thou verse 9 and 10
[24:17] he said
[24:18] i heard the thy voice in the garden and
[24:20] i was afraid because i was naked and i
[24:22] hid myself
[24:23] at no time in this exchange amen
[24:27] does it does it give us a clear
[24:30] distinction that they are looking at
[24:31] each other
[24:32] face to face he calls to adam where are
[24:36] you
[24:37] adam calls back i hid myself from you
[24:41] then god takes him and he covers in my
[24:43] clothes but we understand
[24:44] it was the voice of god noted the
[24:47] presence of god was there and in the
[24:49] presence of god because the voice of god
[24:52] he realized he had to hide himself
[24:54] because his religion was not going to
[24:58] work
[25:00] now let's go from here
[25:03] and go over to revelation chapter 3.
[25:09] it's the beginning of the book
[25:12] now let's go to the end of the book
[25:16] remember what starts in revelation ends
[25:17] in genesis all right what starts in
[25:18] genesis ends in revelation
[25:21] revelation 3 and 20
[25:25] behold i stand at the door and knock if
[25:28] any man
[25:28] hear my voice how is he knocking
[25:33] he didn't say if any men hear my knock
[25:36] he says if any man hear my voice
[25:41] if any man hear my voice and open the
[25:44] door i will come into him and will
[25:46] suffer with him
[25:47] and he with me brother brennan makes
[25:50] this statement he just injects
[25:51] a statement in the message harvest time
[25:54] so notice
[25:54] he never walked out with her she put him
[25:57] out
[25:58] the word rejected him he's referring
[26:01] back to adam and the woman when the
[26:04] woman
[26:04] fell adam went out with her knowing we
[26:07] was doing wrong but he went out with her
[26:08] to save her amen but now when we get to
[26:11] the end of the book the story is
[26:12] different
[26:13] now the church ages the latest in church
[26:16] age has put him
[26:17] out so it's the opposite now
[26:20] now what happened eve by her fallen
[26:22] condition put herself
[26:24] out amen from the promise of god put
[26:26] herself out of the garden
[26:27] and adam went out with her to save her
[26:29] amen but
[26:30] now god christ has been walking through
[26:33] the midst of the churches but at the end
[26:34] time
[26:35] he is put on the outside of the church
[26:37] and he is knocking
[26:39] with a voice the voice in this last day
[26:42] is
[26:42] calling amen those to open up and
[26:44] brother bear says to go
[26:46] out to him he's not coming back into
[26:49] laodicea
[26:50] but now he's calling for you to leave
[26:52] the fig leaf religion amen
[26:54] leave the hiding amongst the trees amen
[26:57] leave
[26:57] everything and come out and bury
[26:59] yourself before him
[27:00] no more fig leaves no more hiding no
[27:03] more pretending
[27:04] no more acting like everything's all
[27:06] right but the voice in the last day
[27:08] is calling us to come out from among her
[27:10] my people
[27:11] amen and we come out naked and bear amen
[27:14] having sinned and been born and said
[27:16] with nothing to cover ourselves with and
[27:19] when we come out to him
[27:20] then he gives us the word and we become
[27:22] clothed in the word
[27:24] and become his righteousness so we went
[27:28] one way in the garden but now it's the
[27:30] opposite now
[27:31] she the false bride has put her
[27:34] bridegroom
[27:35] out and he stands out calling to his
[27:38] bride to come
[27:39] but he's calling with his voice the word
[27:41] in this day
[27:43] and when you hear him knocking we go out
[27:47] and join ourselves to him
[27:49] leaving all the fig leaves behind no
[27:52] works
[27:53] no acts of righteousness that can cover
[27:55] my sin there's nothing
[27:56] the only thing that i can be clothed in
[27:58] is his righteousness
[28:00] his word so now in the end time the
[28:04] bride must
[28:05] leave the fig leaves must leave religion
[28:08] must leave false understanding
[28:10] must leave dogmas and creeds and ideas
[28:12] of men and
[28:13] she must go out to christ because christ
[28:15] has been put out of the church
[28:17] but he's been put out of the church amen
[28:19] to go back into eden
[28:22] and now he's calling his bride out of
[28:24] the church to go with him back to eden
[28:28] he cannot go back to eden alone
[28:32] is this clear because he declares the
[28:35] end from the beginning
[28:37] so the things that he had done in the
[28:38] beginning is declaring what the end will
[28:40] be
[28:41] and in the beginning amen there was
[28:43] there was one man
[28:44] alone in the garden and god said it was
[28:46] not good that man shall dwell alone
[28:48] i'll make a help meet for him so out of
[28:50] the man he took the ingredients to form
[28:52] the woman and he put the two back
[28:54] together and brother benham said that
[28:56] was the crowning
[28:57] act a crowning achievement of all of
[28:59] creation
[29:01] so and then after that he says it's all
[29:03] very good and he went to take his rest
[29:04] there was no more work for him to do
[29:07] he had completed what was in his mind
[29:09] and now that's the picture that we're
[29:11] being restored
[29:12] back to so when when when christ is put
[29:15] out of the church
[29:16] he's free to go back to eden but he
[29:18] cannot go back to eden by himself
[29:23] he has to have that masterpiece in the
[29:26] right
[29:26] image to go back to eden
[29:30] so he has to have if there's going to be
[29:32] a masterpiece family there's got to be a
[29:34] he was the masterpiece bridegroom now
[29:36] there's got to be a masterpiece bride
[29:40] so there is a necessity for a bride
[29:44] there is no option for a bride there has
[29:47] to be a bride
[29:49] the prophecy shows there'll be a bride
[29:51] the type in the scripture shows there'll
[29:52] be a bride and then the word in
[29:54] revelation shows there'll be a bride
[29:55] there absolutely has to be a bride
[29:57] without spot and wrinkle
[29:59] and she has to stand in the glory and
[30:00] splendor of him she has to be
[30:03] a man adorned for her bridegroom
[30:07] let's turn to hebrews 11
[30:10] and look at a couple more scriptures
[30:33] and what shall i more say this is 11 32
[30:36] hebrews 11
[30:37] 32 and what shall i more say for time
[30:40] shall fail me to tell of gideon
[30:41] and the barack and of samson and of
[30:44] jephthah and of david and also
[30:46] and samuel and of the prophets who
[30:48] through faith subdued kingdoms
[30:50] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[30:53] stopped the mouths of lions quenched the
[30:55] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[30:57] sword
[30:58] out of weakness were made strong wax
[31:00] valiant and fight
[31:01] turned to flight the armies of the
[31:02] aliens women received their dead raised
[31:05] to life again and the others were
[31:06] tortured not accepting deliverance
[31:08] that they might obtain a better
[31:10] resurrection and others had trial of
[31:12] cruel mockings and scourging jay more
[31:14] over of bonds and imprisonment
[31:16] they were stoned they were sawn asunder
[31:19] they were tempted were slain with the
[31:20] sword
[31:21] they wondered about in sheepskins and
[31:23] ghost skins being destitute afflicted
[31:25] tormented
[31:26] of whom the world was not worthy they
[31:28] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[31:30] in dens and in caves
[31:32] of the earth and these all having
[31:34] obtained a good report through faith
[31:36] receive not the promise god having
[31:38] provided some better thing for us
[31:40] that they without us should not be made
[31:43] perfect
[31:45] so when we look back to the heroes of
[31:47] the faith and we look look back to
[31:49] hebrews chapter 11 amen it's astounding
[31:51] we
[31:52] we talk about david and we talk about
[31:54] samuel and we could go through and we
[31:55] could take each one of these lives
[31:57] and point out the supernatural and these
[31:59] are heroes let's say these are bible
[32:02] characters these are individuals
[32:03] who did exploits for the lord they've
[32:05] been our heroes they've been
[32:07] uh they've been so highly esteemed in
[32:10] our thoughts all of our lives
[32:12] we've been raised in christianity daniel
[32:14] you mentioned daniel
[32:15] oh daniel the great prophet you
[32:17] mentioned david the great king
[32:19] you mentioned all of these ones you
[32:20] mentioned them and samson and all that
[32:22] he did
[32:23] and all that they've done and all of
[32:24] their glory and all their mind they're
[32:26] our heroes
[32:28] but yet they without us are not yet made
[32:31] perfect
[32:33] like there's a dependency amen on the
[32:36] scriptures
[32:37] to come to fruition to come to the
[32:38] fulfillment there has to be a bride at
[32:41] the end time
[32:42] there has to be a capstone there has to
[32:44] be a bride
[32:45] there has to be one that completes this
[32:47] scripture completes this work
[32:49] finishes her course and does what she's
[32:51] predestinated to do and
[32:52] all of the scripture and every bible
[32:54] character in all is waiting depending
[32:57] on this manifestation to come to
[32:59] perfection
[33:01] that's why that's why when you when you
[33:04] come and recognize who you are and get
[33:05] your position
[33:06] all heaven is behind you i mean it's
[33:10] all heaven is behind you because all
[33:12] heaven is depending on you
[33:16] now remember this is the mystery this is
[33:18] the great mystery
[33:20] amongst the gentiles christ in you the
[33:22] hope of glory
[33:24] now if you look at that the way it's
[33:26] ordered christ in you the hope of glory
[33:27] it didn't say christ in you the hope of
[33:30] your glory
[33:31] or of you someday coming to glory but
[33:33] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[33:37] all of glory everything is depending on
[33:39] god
[33:40] keeping his word and finishing whatever
[33:42] went wrong
[33:43] in eden has to be restored and brought
[33:45] back right amen and there's a
[33:47] predestinated people on the earth at the
[33:49] end time
[33:49] that'll be the ones that he comes down
[33:52] and lives inside of you and does
[33:54] the work to restore back and finish
[33:56] complete
[33:57] restore what's been broken
[34:01] so when you think of daniel and how
[34:03] wonderful daniel was in abraham and how
[34:05] you'd like to shake
[34:06] his hand and samuel what a mighty
[34:07] prophet he was in all the works he does
[34:09] just remember that as much as you're
[34:11] admiring daniel
[34:13] daniel is admiring you
[34:17] remember brother branham went to the
[34:18] sixth dimension
[34:20] and when he got over to the sixth
[34:21] dimension amen
[34:23] he he couldn't even find words to
[34:26] express how wonderful it was
[34:27] he didn't want to come back amen he had
[34:29] a wife laying
[34:30] in the next bed over next to him and and
[34:33] he didn't even
[34:34] want to go back even though he had a
[34:35] wife there and children there it was so
[34:37] beautiful and so perfect
[34:38] but he makes he makes this statement he
[34:40] said i want to see jesus he said you
[34:42] can't see him he's a little higher
[34:46] so you begin to realize even in the
[34:48] sixth dimension
[34:50] they were still under a limitation
[34:55] they had not fully realized the promise
[35:00] you cannot fully realize the promise
[35:02] that you come into your perfect triune
[35:03] being
[35:05] they had two parts they had a redeemed
[35:07] soul amen and they had their theophany
[35:09] bodies
[35:10] but their glorified bodies they had not
[35:12] yet amen and so they
[35:13] they could not they'd not haven't
[35:15] finished the course they're still
[35:16] limited
[35:17] you say but but they're in glory they're
[35:19] in paradise it's wonderful brother
[35:21] branham couldn't describe it
[35:22] yet they were not settled there to stop
[35:24] there they mean they were all
[35:26] rooting for brother branham amen they
[35:28] were calling for him to press the battle
[35:30] to press
[35:30] on amen to finish the course to finish
[35:33] this thing because we're hung out here
[35:34] no matter how perfect it is it's not
[35:36] complete yet
[35:37] it's not finished we've got to finish
[35:40] our part
[35:40] for them to be able to move from the
[35:42] sixth to the seventh dimension
[35:46] you can say they're stuck in the sex i
[35:47] wouldn't say being in the six is stuck
[35:50] that gives the wrong impression but yet
[35:53] they are still
[35:54] under a limitation there's something yet
[35:56] that has to happen
[35:57] there's something yet that has to be
[35:59] finished there's part of the redemption
[36:01] cycle
[36:01] that is still cycling through and has to
[36:04] come to fullness
[36:05] and then before they can even be
[36:07] released i don't even want to use the
[36:08] word released
[36:10] because it sounds like bondage but so
[36:12] that they can fully realize the fullness
[36:15] of the promise
[36:19] brother brahm says in the statute of a
[36:20] perfect man you get it these people who
[36:23] died in here
[36:24] are depending and waiting on us so this
[36:27] church has got to come to perfection in
[36:29] order to bring the resurrection
[36:31] and they're under souls under the altar
[36:33] waiting for this church to come to its
[36:35] perfection
[36:36] that when christ does come so
[36:40] now they're they're there those people
[36:43] are there
[36:44] waiting on us depending on us and don't
[36:47] think they're not rooting for you
[36:51] see there's a necessity for a bride
[36:53] there has to be a bride
[36:55] there's got to be somebody taking
[36:57] manna's word amen
[36:58] they live their portion and because they
[37:00] live their portion amen they created the
[37:02] circumstances where i can now live my
[37:05] portion if they hadn't lived their
[37:06] portion there would be no word
[37:08] to progress to move along there would be
[37:10] nothing for me to stand upon to make the
[37:12] next step on the ladder
[37:14] they live their portion of the word to
[37:16] get us to the place where we are now
[37:19] amen and now we have to live our portion
[37:22] of the word
[37:22] to get the whole thing back to the place
[37:25] where it needs to be
[37:27] every step every rung on the ladder has
[37:30] had predestinated seed in their season
[37:33] to move the kingdom to further the cause
[37:35] to move redemption
[37:36] up one notch one more step amen and now
[37:39] if we don't take the last step they all
[37:43] are
[37:43] hung up on this step
[37:46] you realize the whole movement of christ
[37:48] the whole movement of the word
[37:51] is moving up to this step
[37:54] dependent and waiting on an end time
[37:57] bride of people in the last day
[37:59] to make that final step and when they
[38:02] make that final step
[38:03] everybody that made a step on this
[38:06] ladder
[38:06] moves with the final step remember
[38:10] i was with moses i was with
[38:14] noah you remember that when they crossed
[38:16] the red sea
[38:17] brother said i was there
[38:20] amen why because it's the word if you're
[38:23] the word that's the word
[38:24] every part that's the word is all the
[38:26] same thing and it's not been
[38:28] me and you and you and me it's been the
[38:30] word moving all the way through to bring
[38:32] about redemption
[38:35] and when the word moved back there i
[38:37] moved with it
[38:39] because in me is an attribute of god
[38:42] is the word so when the word
[38:46] moved i moved that's why when the word
[38:49] come in fullness
[38:50] it was nailed to a cross amen i paid the
[38:53] price brother
[38:54] said i paid the price for my sins there
[38:57] on that cross
[39:00] that's why i'm not coming to
[39:01] condemnation i will not be in the
[39:03] judgment amen because i was already
[39:05] judged there
[39:06] because i am part of the word
[39:10] that's why we can believe the word is
[39:13] because we're part of the word
[39:15] so there's a portion to be fulfilled in
[39:17] this day
[39:19] brother bram says in the seed shall not
[39:21] be heir with the shock
[39:23] that's what the church is doing today
[39:25] for jesus is the word and he is the
[39:26] bridegroom
[39:27] and the bride is a part of the groom
[39:29] therefore the word
[39:30] that is to be fulfilled this day is the
[39:33] same part of the word that was to be
[39:35] fulfilled in his day
[39:37] it's the same word don't break it up and
[39:40] make it well that was jesus this is
[39:42] us i was there
[39:45] i was there and he's here
[39:49] same experience same life for when god
[39:52] separated adam he was both
[39:54] we find out adam was spirit to begin
[39:56] with the man he made man in his own
[39:58] image created him male and female
[40:00] and then genesis 2 and on
[40:03] he created man out of the dust of the
[40:05] earth man was created in god's image
[40:07] god is a spirit so he's a spirit man and
[40:09] when he become flesh man animal flesh on
[40:12] the earth
[40:12] he is showing portraying here the bride
[40:15] he'd never
[40:16] taken and made another being but he took
[40:18] part of adam the original creation
[40:20] took from him a rib from his side and
[40:23] took the feminist spirit of adam
[40:25] left the masculine spirit in there and
[40:27] placed it in the feminist part
[40:28] therefore part of his spirit part of his
[40:31] body flesh of his flesh
[40:32] bone of his bone word of his word life
[40:35] of his life
[40:36] and that's the way the bride is to
[40:38] christ
[40:40] and that's why the rapture of the royal
[40:42] seat has to come first and the rest of
[40:44] the dead lived not for a thousand years
[40:46] then they were brought up at the white
[40:48] throne judgment there is no
[40:50] judgment to the royal seed or the
[40:52] predestinated seed
[40:53] of abraham no judgment
[40:57] you've passed from death unto life
[41:00] brother brahma it says in harvest time
[41:02] and in that day
[41:05] luke 17 20 i believe it is he's
[41:08] referring to 1730.
[41:09] jesus said when the son of man is being
[41:11] revealed not man the son of man
[41:13] not an organization the son of man the
[41:16] word
[41:16] living itself again among the people
[41:20] so he's telling us what the son of man
[41:22] is the word living itself again among
[41:24] the people see
[41:25] the word itself made flesh in you
[41:29] you are a reflection of this hour the
[41:31] message reflection of it see you live
[41:34] again
[41:35] live the life that was in jesus christ
[41:40] see this is why we're ambassadors for
[41:44] christ
[41:45] and when we stand on the word all of
[41:48] heaven is behind us
[41:50] and and it needs to be more of a reality
[41:53] and then there's just not a cute
[41:54] statement
[41:55] but it's an absolute reality that when
[41:57] we're standing on the word amen and
[41:59] we're staking a stand on the word and
[42:01] speaking the word
[42:02] all of heaven is backing us up
[42:05] because this is the portion of the word
[42:08] that has to be made manifest
[42:09] there's no return to eden there's no
[42:11] completion of redemption amen there's no
[42:13] resurrection of the dead there's nothing
[42:15] going to happen
[42:16] until this part is complete
[42:19] and i say lord complete it in me
[42:25] i don't my desire to preach this is not
[42:29] there's no desire in me to put pressure
[42:32] on people to conform
[42:34] because that's not going to work
[42:36] alzheimer's like oh man
[42:38] if i mess that up i'm holding up the
[42:40] whole resurrection well that's the truth
[42:44] but that kind of mentality will never
[42:47] get you anywhere amen
[42:49] but the realization that they're all
[42:51] depending on me
[42:52] all heaven is behind me i'm living the
[42:54] portion whatever it was in moses that
[42:56] gave the moses the power to
[42:58] overcome amen there's something greater
[43:00] than that in me to give me the power to
[43:02] overcome this day
[43:03] there's nothing that can stop the word
[43:05] there's nothing that can stop my forward
[43:07] march
[43:07] there's nothing that can keep me from
[43:09] filling god's purpose in my life
[43:11] because i'm part of this great chain of
[43:13] redemption
[43:15] it's not a forcing it's not a oh god
[43:18] help me i'm going to ruin the whole
[43:20] thing for everybody
[43:23] but realizing god is not going to let it
[43:26] be ruined
[43:28] [Music]
[43:30] you realize i hope i can express this
[43:34] in the way it's in my heart but god will
[43:36] allow
[43:37] something to be destroyed so he can make
[43:40] it back the way he wants it
[43:45] he found we find in genesis 1
[43:49] genesis 1 verse 2 a world that's
[43:51] destroyed
[43:53] because it was in a condition he didn't
[43:55] want it in
[43:57] it was in chaos brother said under
[43:58] judgment from a previous civilization
[44:01] and god will allow that to be destroyed
[44:05] so that he can make it back to something
[44:07] he wants
[44:10] and god he has allowed
[44:13] the church ages the churches the
[44:15] denominations to go to
[44:17] absolute total ruin
[44:20] so that he could have a bride of his own
[44:22] jews
[44:24] god sometimes will allow our lives to
[44:26] come to nothing
[44:28] he'll allow our choices to fall flat our
[44:30] thinking to come to ruin
[44:32] his sometimes allow us to come to
[44:34] absolute destruction
[44:37] because he wants to make it the way he
[44:39] wants it
[44:41] i want to ask you genesis
[44:44] 1 2 was it a good thing or a bad thing
[44:52] was it a good thing or a bad thing the
[44:54] earth destroyed
[44:55] it just depends on whether or not you
[44:56] want an eden
[44:57] [Music]
[44:59] if you're one in eden then it was a good
[45:01] thing
[45:02] if you wanted to preserve whatever was
[45:04] there before then it's a bad thing
[45:05] i don't know it was there before all i
[45:07] know is eden so i think it was a good
[45:09] thing
[45:10] and when god absolutely destroys the
[45:13] thinking of men denominational systems
[45:15] creeds and dogmas
[45:16] and church systems amen is it a good
[45:18] thing or a bad thing that the church's
[45:20] fault to ruin
[45:20] is it a good thing or a bad thing that
[45:22] every system has failed is that a good
[45:24] thing or a bad thing
[45:25] i think it's a good thing because god
[45:28] has allowed
[45:29] everything man has done to completely
[45:30] fail amen so
[45:32] out of the ashes of that he can bring up
[45:34] what he's always wanted and he's wanted
[45:36] a bride of his own choosing
[45:40] so you say oh the world's falling apart
[45:43] look at everything look at the churches
[45:44] look at all that's falling apart
[45:46] i'm saying praise god let it fall apart
[45:49] amen because he's trying to build
[45:51] what he's always wanted he's always
[45:53] wanted a bride of his own choosing
[45:56] and at the end he's going to allow this
[45:58] world to completely be destroyed
[46:00] amen and burnt over amen so that we can
[46:02] have a millennium
[46:03] amen how many once a millennium if you
[46:05] want a millennium
[46:06] then then the fires in california aren't
[46:09] a bad thing
[46:11] the earthquakes in diverse places aren't
[46:14] a bad thing
[46:15] the storms and the hurricanes and the
[46:17] floods it's not a bad thing it's a bad
[46:19] thing
[46:20] to human life it's bad it's sad we don't
[46:22] like to see it but when you back up and
[46:24] look on the grand scale of things
[46:26] this earth is longing to reproduce
[46:28] itself for a millennium
[46:30] it's it's it's eager groaning looking
[46:33] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[46:35] that's what we're watching take place in
[46:37] the earth right now the earth is
[46:39] actually rumbling and moving amen to the
[46:42] maturity of the bride
[46:44] because it wants to bring forth a bright
[46:45] new world for a millennial reign
[46:49] is it a good thing or a bad thing it
[46:51] just depends on if you want a millennium
[46:52] or not
[46:54] if you want a millennium it's a good
[46:55] thing amen the government is absolutely
[46:57] falling apart
[46:58] america is absolutely coming to disgrace
[47:01] and ruin is that a good thing or a bad
[47:03] thing
[47:03] i say it's a good thing because the
[47:05] kingdoms of this world have become the
[47:06] kingdoms of our lord
[47:09] and it's christ
[47:12] don't try to prop up what god is trying
[47:15] to let fall
[47:16] [Applause]
[47:18] don't prop up men's ideas of man's
[47:20] religion and politics
[47:21] and government let them all fall
[47:25] because what he's trying to bring out of
[47:26] that he's trying to bring and produce
[47:29] and declare
[47:30] and show a bride of his own choosing
[47:35] let everything else fall and don't let
[47:37] your heart be troubled
[47:41] don't let your heart be troubled look up
[47:44] thy redemption draweth nigh
[47:46] and i'll say it like this your
[47:47] redemption is here
[47:49] [Music]
[47:50] he is here amen he's here to complete
[47:53] the work in
[47:54] us it's essential that there's a bride i
[47:56] mean there's a necessity that there's a
[47:58] bride
[47:58] amen there is no millennium without a
[48:00] bride
[48:02] and until the bride comes the fullness
[48:04] and gets out of the way there's no
[48:05] expression of the 144 000
[48:07] which is the redemption of all the jews
[48:09] from the time of christ and on
[48:11] the redemption of all the jews from the
[48:13] time of christ is on is dependent on
[48:15] there being 144 000
[48:17] little benjamin that shows up right on
[48:18] time
[48:21] do you think all those souls under the
[48:23] altar under the sacrifice altar
[48:25] amen in the sixth dimension are not
[48:28] rooting for 144
[48:29] 000 wanting 144 000 to come on the scene
[48:32] wanting them to believe
[48:33] receive the message absolutely
[48:37] their white robes are linked they meant
[48:39] to the 144
[48:40] 000.
[48:44] but that 144 000 amen will not come to
[48:48] the revelation under the two witnesses
[48:50] until the bride gets out of the way
[48:54] there'll be no millennium until the
[48:56] bride comes to full manifestation
[49:01] you realize there has to be an end time
[49:03] bride
[49:05] and she's got to cut she's got to be
[49:07] everything the word said she would be
[49:11] if that's the case
[49:16] let's go back to moses there had to be
[49:20] a deliverer because he said there would
[49:22] be a deliverer
[49:24] there was a promise of a land for the
[49:27] children of abraham there had to be
[49:30] a deliverer bring them out of bondage
[49:33] into that land
[49:34] had to happen god had a man
[49:38] he had ordained before the foundation of
[49:39] the world to play that part and that man
[49:41] was moses
[49:42] nobody else could do it moses had to do
[49:45] it but moses failed
[49:47] his first effort failed he run to the
[49:51] wilderness
[49:52] running away from his commission when
[49:54] god come to get him back
[49:56] he'd been so humbled that he began to
[49:58] argue with god about whether or not he
[50:00] was even able to go back and be a
[50:01] deliverer
[50:04] failed running away out of a commission
[50:07] 40 years of nothing
[50:11] but god had no option
[50:13] [Music]
[50:15] but to come down supernaturally and get
[50:18] a hold of moses
[50:20] and bring moses back into the position
[50:23] to be the deliverer
[50:24] and to bring them out of bondage and
[50:26] bring them to the promised land
[50:28] why because he ordained it he promised
[50:30] it it's in the word and this is the
[50:32] ordained vessel he chose to use it
[50:34] he cannot change his plan and if he
[50:36] couldn't change his plan for moses
[50:38] remember i was in moses
[50:41] i was with moses i was there with noah i
[50:44] was there when they crossed the red sea
[50:48] and now i'm here in another form and in
[50:51] another expression
[50:52] amen and just like that couldn't fail
[50:54] this expression cannot fail
[50:57] amen i can make choices as a man i can
[50:59] make decisions that are wrong
[51:01] i can pay the consequences for that i
[51:03] can step to the right or to the left
[51:05] i can create all kinds of troubles but
[51:07] god can't let me go and pluck somebody
[51:09] else out and put me in the place and
[51:10] said that's my bride
[51:12] no because if he's ordained me and put
[51:14] my name in the lamb's book of life
[51:15] before the foundation of the world and i
[51:17] was predestinated to be here
[51:19] then there's nothing going to stop that
[51:22] manifestation
[51:24] so it's not about me trying really hard
[51:27] it's not about me
[51:28] i mean grunting under the pressure of
[51:30] self-will
[51:31] it's really me relaxing to the
[51:33] revelation of who i actually
[51:34] am and saying god i believe that with
[51:36] all of my heart
[51:37] and i'm totally dependent on you i'm
[51:40] relaxing now
[51:41] i'm yielding to you lord and letting you
[51:43] do the work
[51:46] because if we decide what needs to be
[51:48] done to manifest the bride i guarantee
[51:50] we'll decide wrong
[51:55] i think this manifestation would be
[51:56] right and i think this manifestation
[51:58] would be right and we're going to make
[51:59] the decision wrong
[52:01] what we need to do is relax and let his
[52:03] spirit be
[52:04] he guide us move us into every
[52:05] manifestation that he wants
[52:08] because there has to be an end time
[52:11] bride
[52:12] it's got to be made up of every
[52:13] predestinated member and it's got to
[52:15] stand completely a hundred percent on
[52:17] the word
[52:18] and there is no option
[52:22] now if you believe you're part of that
[52:25] then you have no
[52:26] option you may think you have an option
[52:31] but you have no option
[52:35] amen you have no option it's going to be
[52:39] there and it's going to be that way
[52:40] he'll not lose one
[52:44] so now what do i do i just recognize who
[52:47] i am
[52:49] i feed on the word my husband the
[52:52] revealed word in my mate
[52:54] and let him let him do what he's always
[52:58] intended to do with me
[53:02] but shouldn't it be this brother says it
[53:03] shouldn't be that
[53:05] it should be exactly what he does
[53:08] through
[53:08] you it may never make the newspapers
[53:13] but it's exactly what he wants to do
[53:15] through you
[53:18] it may never it may never make a a a
[53:21] voice book or a twitter post
[53:24] but it'll be exactly what he wants to do
[53:27] through you
[53:29] see we've got to get our own mind out of
[53:31] this thing
[53:33] and let the mind of christ take control
[53:38] in the unveiling of god brother says now
[53:43] if you'll notice in the beginning one
[53:45] word page one in the bible in genesis
[53:48] one
[53:48] we find out that that the whole all
[53:50] sickness all sorrow
[53:52] all heartache and everything that's ever
[53:54] happened to human beings
[53:55] came because one person disbelieved one
[53:58] word caused
[53:59] all this that's the first of the bible
[54:02] and the last of the bible revelation 22
[54:04] the same god said whosoever shall take
[54:06] one word out of this or add one word to
[54:08] it
[54:08] see it must be word by word just the way
[54:11] it is
[54:12] so therefore and just take the little
[54:14] thing like some someone always going to
[54:17] me
[54:18] going on to me about the women bobbing
[54:20] their hair now to me as long as she does
[54:22] that i don't care how saintly she does
[54:25] and how much she knows she is still
[54:27] wrong
[54:28] she wears shorts and these clothes like
[54:29] that i don't care what she does
[54:31] how much she can sing how well she can
[54:33] preach whatever she could do what kind
[54:35] of life she lives
[54:36] is still that one word is broke
[54:39] see it's got to be every word not a
[54:42] sentence a word one word
[54:44] so the bible is no private
[54:46] interpretation it must be
[54:47] word by word the way it's written we
[54:50] must believe that
[54:52] and not only believe it but live it
[54:56] if we don't live it then we don't
[54:58] believe it
[55:00] we just say we do basing back to what i
[55:03] said the disciples could not explain it
[55:04] but they believed it anyway
[55:06] and they made their confession and lived
[55:08] to it when all the rest of them walked
[55:09] away from it they stayed with it
[55:11] they believed it that's the way we do
[55:13] that's the way
[55:14] you've got to do it no matter what
[55:16] anybody else does
[55:18] we believe it and then we act upon it if
[55:20] you don't
[55:21] do it then you don't believe it
[55:25] now that's just the natural outflowing
[55:27] of faith
[55:28] so we we want to stay with the word and
[55:31] keep the word
[55:32] and leave our own thinking out of it and
[55:34] just take the word
[55:36] there's a i want to read this quote on
[55:38] the masterpiece
[55:39] and show what brother betham said
[55:43] he's talking about the the vision he had
[55:45] of the preview of the bride
[55:47] so and i just started to bow my head and
[55:49] i said and he said wait the bride must
[55:51] come again
[55:53] and i looked and here they come again
[55:54] and they passed by a sweet looking
[55:56] little ladies
[55:57] they was all looking right at me there's
[56:00] your first clue
[56:03] they was all looking right at me who
[56:06] were they looking at the seventh angel
[56:09] because the seventh angel was pointing
[56:11] out the seventh seal
[56:15] amen
[56:19] so they passed by sweet looking little
[56:21] ladies they was all looking right at me
[56:23] as they passed by and noticed each each
[56:26] one was dressed different
[56:27] and one in the back had kind of a long
[56:29] hair hanging down and had it rolled
[56:30] around like this
[56:31] might have been german or something like
[56:33] that and i watched them
[56:35] further down he says and not knowing it
[56:37] till just a few minutes ago
[56:38] looked like or just recently see did you
[56:41] notice the bride come in view twice the
[56:44] first seed and the second seed both of
[56:45] them exactly the same one
[56:47] and the reason they were dressed in
[56:49] different parts shall come from all
[56:51] nations
[56:51] it'll make up the bride each one had
[56:53] long hair and no makeup and real pretty
[56:55] girls
[56:56] and they were watching me
[57:00] what must i do brother chad we got to be
[57:03] in the end time what works do i
[57:04] just watch him watch that prophet that
[57:07] prophet will point you the way.
[57:10] they were watching me that represented
[57:12] the bride coming out of all nations see
[57:14] see each one representing the nation as
[57:16] they march perfectly in line with the
[57:18] word
[57:19] and then i i have to watch her
[57:22] she'll get out of step with that word if
[57:25] i don't watch
[57:27] now look when they went by it was a it
[57:30] was a preview or
[57:31] a review booth and he's standing in the
[57:33] booth watching them march by
[57:34] and he watches the first church go by
[57:36] and they're everyone in step with the
[57:38] word they're perfect
[57:39] amen hair hanging down looked sweetly
[57:41] everything was just right
[57:42] amen and then the second one come by and
[57:45] it was the worldly church and he said
[57:46] all the vulgarity and the filth and
[57:48] everything and they went off into
[57:49] destruction
[57:51] and he bent to hang his head because he
[57:53] was so disappointed and discouraged that
[57:55] of all his work that's all that he could
[57:57] produce a bride for christ
[57:59] and all of a sudden he could hear music
[58:01] coming he said there must be another one
[58:03] an onward christian soldier and all of a
[58:05] sudden
[58:05] one began to march by exactly like the
[58:08] first one
[58:10] and he said they looked just right at me
[58:14] and they were marching right in line
[58:15] with the word
[58:17] see when they were looking right at him
[58:19] they were marching right in line with
[58:20] the word
[58:24] and he said i had to watch them
[58:28] he said if i didn't watch them let's
[58:30] read it again
[58:32] i have to watch her she'll get out of
[58:35] step with that word
[58:36] if i don't watch
[58:39] when she is passing by if she gets by
[58:42] if she gets by maybe it'll be my time
[58:45] when i'm oversea
[58:46] when i'm finished or whatever it is she
[58:48] passed by him and he saw two get out of
[58:50] step and he's crying get back in step
[58:52] and he said see when they pass by me and
[58:53] he's musing thinking
[58:55] maybe it's after my time after i'm gone
[58:59] that she'll get out of step now he
[59:03] never quit watching her
[59:07] but what happened was she quit watching
[59:09] him
[59:13] she'll get out of step with that word if
[59:14] i don't watch when she's passing by
[59:16] if she gets by maybe it'll be my time
[59:19] when i'm over see

[59:22] was getting back
[59:23] trying their best and was getting back
[59:25] just get in line because he hollered get
[59:27] back in line
[59:28] they was looking out somewhere else
[59:30] watching about that church that just
[59:32] went out into chaos
[59:35] but the front was never the back ones
[59:36] just two or three of them was kind of
[59:38] stepping out a little bit to the right
[59:40] hand
[59:41] side and looked like was trying to get
[59:42] back in line as they went by
[59:44] they was just past me oh far as here to
[59:47] the wall just past me and i was standing
[59:48] there
[59:49] and then i just seen it all move out and
[59:51] leave but you notice the church only
[59:53] come into view once
[59:54] this is the false church not the bride

[1:00:00] nation the church but the bride come in
[1:00:02] twice see see what it is it was now
[1:00:06] not knowing it but looking at it with
[1:00:08] with my message this morning
[1:00:10] not knowing that see the seed fell in
[1:00:12] the ground at nicaea
[1:00:13] that was the original seed and she came
[1:00:15] through the process of these
[1:00:16] denominations
[1:00:17] which only comes in existence once but
[1:00:20] the bride returns
[1:00:21] back again in the last days i will
[1:00:23] restore see
[1:00:24] the masterpieces brought up we know
[1:00:28] out of those seven denominations seven
[1:00:30] church days we know that there was a
[1:00:31] bride
[1:00:32] in each one that'll be gathered up amen
[1:00:35] and it'll be gathered up and gone amen
[1:00:37] but now he's saying
[1:00:39] now it's not in there anymore that
[1:00:41] church has gone off into total apostasy
[1:00:44] but whatever the church was at the
[1:00:45] beginning amen it will be at the end
[1:00:48] it's restored back to its original
[1:00:49] condition amen
[1:00:51] not the church anymore but the bride
[1:00:57] that's the reason she was in view the
[1:00:59] second time
[1:01:00] she was reviewing the first time then
[1:01:02] she was reviewing the second time
[1:01:03] and she was perfectly the second time
[1:01:05] like she was the first time
[1:01:07] oh god have mercy hurry hurry hurry life
[1:01:10] get in the grain right quick
[1:01:12] all others never appeared no more they
[1:01:14] went out never to come back again
[1:01:17] but the bride come back because she was
[1:01:18] alpha and omega
[1:01:20] god the great sculptor has made him a
[1:01:22] masterpiece for it's a piece of his
[1:01:24] first masterpiece
[1:01:25] like he made in the garden of eden and
[1:01:27] took a piece from and made another piece
[1:01:30] and that was martin fell now he's been
[1:01:32] all this time building it up again
[1:01:34] and he brought forth his masterpiece and
[1:01:36] was smitten in order
[1:01:37] that part that was smitten was in order
[1:01:39] to bring back again that masterpiece
[1:01:41] again
[1:01:42] so the masterpiece and the son of god
[1:01:44] the masterpiece and the bride
[1:01:46] and it's a piece of him which must be
[1:01:48] the fulfilling of the word
[1:01:51] the word has been fulfilled and we're
[1:01:53] ready for the coming of the lord
[1:01:56] it must be the fulfilling of the word
[1:01:58] and it is the fulfilling
[1:02:00] of the word just as he was the
[1:02:03] fulfilling of the word
[1:02:04] this is the fulfilling of the word
[1:02:10] we're not here by chance we're not here
[1:02:13] just trying to make our way through this
[1:02:14] world
[1:02:16] got to get that image out of our minds
[1:02:19] you are no more just trying to make your
[1:02:21] way through this world
[1:02:22] any more than moses was just trying to
[1:02:23] make his way through this world
[1:02:25] any more than the apostle paul was
[1:02:26] trying to make his way through this
[1:02:28] world or any other elect predestinated
[1:02:30] seed of god
[1:02:31] you're just as much not here just
[1:02:33] traveling randomly through
[1:02:34] trying to figure it out and do the best
[1:02:36] you can you are ordained amen to be here
[1:02:39] in this eighth
[1:02:39] you have a position in the masterpiece
[1:02:42] amen and
[1:02:42] all of heaven is depending on this bride
[1:02:45] amen coming to the perfection of the
[1:02:47] fulfillment of all the word
[1:02:50] all heaven is behind it god is
[1:02:53] for it god is moving it god is making it
[1:02:56] happen
[1:02:57] amen we just need to yield ourselves
[1:02:59] completely to that
[1:03:01] and just trust and just rest and have
[1:03:04] joy
[1:03:07] why should we have joy why should we
[1:03:10] have such freedom
[1:03:11] amen listen that little sheep that has a
[1:03:15] shepherd watching over him
[1:03:17] that little sheep is an absolute freedom
[1:03:19] with no string attached
[1:03:22] because that that sheep can run and
[1:03:25] frolic and play in the field and
[1:03:27] go by the still waters and have a drink
[1:03:30] and lay down
[1:03:31] and romp around because it knows that
[1:03:32] there's a shepherd watching making sure
[1:03:34] there's no predator that's going to come
[1:03:36] making sure that the sheep's not going
[1:03:38] to eat the wrong kind of food
[1:03:40] making sure the sheep doesn't get off
[1:03:41] the path into danger because every time
[1:03:44] that sheep eats the wrong food he
[1:03:46] corrects the sheep
[1:03:48] and every time that little sheep gets on
[1:03:50] the wrong path his rod of correction
[1:03:52] comes down and corrects that sheep
[1:03:54] amen and thy rod and thy staff they
[1:03:56] comfort me and why does the shepherd do
[1:03:58] that to that particular sheep
[1:04:00] amen because that's his sheep
[1:04:03] and he's not going to let his sheep eat
[1:04:06] wrong food
[1:04:06] his sheep get lost his sheep get injured
[1:04:09] he's watching over his sheep and that
[1:04:12] gives the sheep the freedom to play in
[1:04:14] the field
[1:04:16] we should be happy people not tense and
[1:04:18] nervous
[1:04:19] every second i'm going to mess up and
[1:04:20] i'm going to make a mistake and i'm
[1:04:22] going to ruin it for all of
[1:04:23] all of creation
[1:04:27] there's a true reality amen that the
[1:04:29] portion in you has got to come to full
[1:04:31] fruition it has to
[1:04:32] there and we can slow down we can hinder
[1:04:35] the work of god
[1:04:36] that's what brother branham told us
[1:04:38] that's true
[1:04:39] but we don't wring our hands in fear we
[1:04:41] should be happy people
[1:04:42] in trusting the lord that i've got a
[1:04:44] shepherd this is his plan
[1:04:46] he called me i didn't call myself he
[1:04:48] chose me
[1:04:49] i didn't choose myself he ordained me
[1:04:51] before the foundation lord i didn't
[1:04:53] ordain myself
[1:04:54] he placed me in this position in this
[1:04:56] time in this body
[1:04:57] and i'm free and i'm happy and i'm
[1:05:00] enjoying it because i have a father who
[1:05:02] watches over me
[1:05:03] i have a shepherd who makes sure if i
[1:05:05] eat the wrong thing
[1:05:06] amen if i go and i eat the wrong kind of
[1:05:09] doctrine he's going to bring a
[1:05:10] correction
[1:05:11] [Applause]
[1:05:13] i'm free to enjoy the message
[1:05:20] i'm happy to feed on the word and enjoy
[1:05:23] the word
[1:05:24] because there's a shepherd that if i get
[1:05:25] off he will correct me
[1:05:27] in his rod and i staff they don't scare
[1:05:29] me his rod and my staff they comfort me
[1:05:32] i'm not afraid of being lost i've never
[1:05:34] been lost
[1:05:39] not that this flesh hasn't been lost not
[1:05:41] in this manifestation we come into the
[1:05:43] world lost but he knew where i was
[1:05:47] in my perspective i was lost he had to
[1:05:50] find me
[1:05:51] and redeem me back because of the fall
[1:05:54] but he knew where i was
[1:05:56] he knew where i'd come forth he knew who
[1:05:58] his sheep were
[1:05:59] he knew she could hear his voice and all
[1:06:01] he had to do was make the call and she
[1:06:02] would come running
[1:06:05] thank you my name was on the last book
[1:06:07] of life this portion of me brother
[1:06:08] said maybe not the name you have now
[1:06:12] but whatever denotes the seed on the
[1:06:13] inside of you was written in that last
[1:06:15] book of life before the foundation of
[1:06:16] the world
[1:06:18] and he's not losing that book he
[1:06:19] redeemed that book
[1:06:21] now it comes down into a fallen
[1:06:23] condition and fallen flesh with a fallen
[1:06:25] mind and that has to be bought back
[1:06:29] that's what was lost but
[1:06:32] he knows who are his
[1:06:35] he knows who's written in the book
[1:06:40] do you understand and all
[1:06:43] that is written in the lamb's book of
[1:06:45] life he said shall come to me
[1:06:48] and i will no eyes cast them out and i
[1:06:51] will lose none
[1:06:57] don't be afraid be happy
[1:07:03] but god has a rod of correction that
[1:07:06] should make you
[1:07:07] happy
[1:07:10] i don't know i don't know sometimes
[1:07:14] where we get the wrong ideas because
[1:07:16] they don't come from the scripture but
[1:07:17] sometimes we get the wrong ideas
[1:07:20] that somehow i'm going to be
[1:07:23] uh i'm going to mess up and god will
[1:07:27] cast me away and never take me back
[1:07:33] that somehow i'm going to mess up so big
[1:07:35] this time
[1:07:38] so big this time that he won't forgive
[1:07:40] me this time
[1:07:43] see that's how humans act
[1:07:47] but that's not how god acts but the real
[1:07:50] reality is
[1:07:52] if i was in him i'm going back to him
[1:07:58] and do i do wrong things yes do i do it
[1:08:00] intentionally sometimes
[1:08:01] yes have i felt his rod
[1:08:05] yes
[1:08:09] but he's a good shepherd and his rodney
[1:08:12] staff
[1:08:12] they comfort me i know
[1:08:16] he will not let me get too far without
[1:08:19] bringing the crowd down on my back does
[1:08:22] it hurt
[1:08:23] yes is it disappointing absolutely
[1:08:26] do you cry buckets of tears
[1:08:30] is it devastating to you absolutely
[1:08:34] but he not going to lose you he's
[1:08:38] not going to lose you
[1:08:42] you go wayward he knows how to get moses
[1:08:45] out of the backside of the desert he
[1:08:48] knows how to get jonah
[1:08:51] over to nineveh he knows how to get
[1:08:53] elijah to
[1:08:54] finish his finish his commission
[1:08:58] he knows where to find us and he knows
[1:09:00] how to put us back in our commission
[1:09:03] don't don't let the devil lie he's a
[1:09:06] father
[1:09:08] do children do do children want to
[1:09:10] please their father
[1:09:11] yes do children get nervous when they
[1:09:14] make a mistake knowing correction is
[1:09:15] coming
[1:09:15] absolutely but with the right kind of
[1:09:19] relationship between father
[1:09:20] and son or father and daughter there's a
[1:09:23] peace that comes with having a father
[1:09:26] there's a rest that comes with knowing
[1:09:28] i've got somebody who's watching over me
[1:09:32] and we've got somebody who's watching
[1:09:33] over us
[1:09:35] will he let you make mistakes of course
[1:09:38] because those mistakes work right around
[1:09:39] to his glory
[1:09:42] will he let you fail absolutely
[1:09:45] because sometimes it's the very thing he
[1:09:47] needs you to do so you learn the thing
[1:09:48] that you need for what comes next
[1:09:52] that's why israel and his staff they
[1:09:54] comfort me
[1:09:55] i say thank you lord i appreciate that
[1:10:02] in the end time sign seed he says he is
[1:10:05] the word
[1:10:06] he is the word when you receive the word
[1:10:08] you receive jesus for he is the word
[1:10:11] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:10:13] us we believe that don't we every bit
[1:10:15] we believe that christ is god's word
[1:10:17] made manifest and we believe that his
[1:10:18] bride must be the same
[1:10:20] thing catch that
[1:10:24] when you receive the word you receive
[1:10:26] jesus for he is the word
[1:10:30] the word was made manifest and dwell
[1:10:32] made manif made flesh i'm sorry
[1:10:34] and dwelt among us we believe that don't
[1:10:36] we every bit we believe that christ is
[1:10:38] god's word made manifest
[1:10:40] and we believe that his bride must be
[1:10:42] the same
[1:10:43] thing is what
[1:10:46] the word made flesh god's word made
[1:10:50] manifest
[1:10:51] we believe that she must believe every
[1:10:53] bit of the word and have that word in
[1:10:55] her
[1:10:56] because she is part of the body she is
[1:10:59] the body
[1:11:00] where he is the head
[1:11:04] i want to take a look here at something
[1:11:06] brother bam says in the seventh seal
[1:11:07] and we're going to go to colossians
[1:11:09] let's go ahead and turn to colossians
[1:11:10] we'll read that in just a minute
[1:11:12] back to colossians 1 where we were
[1:11:26] and the seventh seal brother ben says
[1:11:28] it's an old battle
[1:11:29] that started way back beyond time and
[1:11:32] then they
[1:11:33] satan and his angels was kicked out and
[1:11:35] when they come to earth the battle set
[1:11:37] in again
[1:11:38] now if you notice i'm taking a little
[1:11:39] different direction but it's going to
[1:11:41] tie together so hang with me on this
[1:11:42] little turn
[1:11:45] and when they come to earth and the
[1:11:46] battle set in again because eve broke
[1:11:48] down the barrier from where she was
[1:11:50] isolated behind the word of god
[1:11:52] and from that very hour satan won the
[1:11:54] battle over god's word
[1:11:56] because one of his subjects the weaker
[1:11:58] let down the bar
[1:12:00] and that's exactly how he's won the
[1:12:02] battle every time
[1:12:03] has been because one of his subjects let
[1:12:05] down the bar
[1:12:06] from the word let's back up and i want
[1:12:10] to
[1:12:10] go through this again it's a battle that
[1:12:13] started
[1:12:14] way back beyond time this thing that
[1:12:17] we're in what we're doing here on earth
[1:12:19] right now
[1:12:20] has everything to do with what happened
[1:12:23] back beyond time
[1:12:27] that's why i said when we're here we're
[1:12:28] not just here eeking out in existence
[1:12:30] we're not just here
[1:12:31] because a man and a woman got married
[1:12:33] and decided to come together
[1:12:35] and in their love they produced a child
[1:12:37] and that child is now trying to do the
[1:12:38] best he can on this earth
[1:12:40] no we're here in the form we're here
[1:12:43] because of what happened before i don't
[1:12:46] understand all of that i cannot
[1:12:48] calculate and compute it and make it
[1:12:50] make sense but there's a link between
[1:12:52] heaven and earth
[1:12:54] because brother bam tells us what you
[1:12:55] see here is a reflection of heaven
[1:12:58] it tells us what you see here you say
[1:13:00] you see a tree struggling for life it
[1:13:01] shows there's a tree somewhere that
[1:13:03] doesn't struggle for life
[1:13:05] this is a reflection of that amen and
[1:13:08] there was a
[1:13:09] there was war there was a battle that
[1:13:10] broke out in heaven amen in that battle
[1:13:13] that broke out in heaven moved down into
[1:13:15] the earth
[1:13:16] he says what he says saint his angels
[1:13:18] was kicked out and then they come to the
[1:13:20] earth and the battle set in
[1:13:22] again because eve broke down the barrier
[1:13:25] from where she was isolated behind
[1:13:27] the word of god and from that very hour
[1:13:30] satan won the battle
[1:13:31] over god's word
[1:13:35] the battle is between god's word
[1:13:38] and satan
[1:13:41] he's trying to get the victory over
[1:13:43] god's word
[1:13:44] and the only way he can get the victory
[1:13:46] over god's word
[1:13:48] is when one of his subjects lets down
[1:13:50] the bar from the word
[1:13:53] satan himself cannot defeat the word of
[1:13:55] god
[1:13:57] i i hope you can catch what i'm saying
[1:14:01] satan himself cannot defeat the word of
[1:14:03] god so in order for him to get
[1:14:05] victory there has to be somebody one of
[1:14:09] the subjects of god
[1:14:11] to let down the bar on the word
[1:14:16] now you see why he fights you every day
[1:14:21] he cannot defeat that word he cannot
[1:14:23] overcome that word
[1:14:24] so what he's trying to get us to do is
[1:14:26] lay down the word
[1:14:28] or bypass the word or skip the word
[1:14:30] because if one of the subjects can let
[1:14:32] down the bar on the word
[1:14:33] then he can get victory again and as
[1:14:36] long as he can get victory again
[1:14:38] his demise amen has been delayed
[1:14:43] his demise is delayed as long as he can
[1:14:46] get this victory
[1:14:47] as long as he can keep winning a battle
[1:14:49] here and a battle there
[1:14:51] he can delay or prolong his
[1:14:53] pronouncement his judgment his demise
[1:14:55] amen and what has he got to do this is
[1:14:57] what brother branham said
[1:14:59] from that very hour satan won the battle
[1:15:01] over god's word because one of his
[1:15:03] subjects the weaker let down the bar
[1:15:05] and that's exactly how he's won the
[1:15:07] battle every time
[1:15:08] has because one of his subjects let down
[1:15:11] the bar from the word
[1:15:14] see now we realize we've mentioned this
[1:15:16] before many times but
[1:15:18] there's a battle going on and you're
[1:15:20] caught up in the middle of the battle
[1:15:22] and it's a fight between satan and god's
[1:15:24] word because he's trying to stop god's
[1:15:25] word
[1:15:26] he's trying to defeat god's word and now
[1:15:29] you are the manifestation of god's word
[1:15:32] god's word is in you
[1:15:34] and this is why he fights you every day
[1:15:37] he brings every
[1:15:38] trap every trick every mental oppression
[1:15:40] every fear every anxiety
[1:15:42] every difficulty he can upon us because
[1:15:45] he's trying to stop
[1:15:46] that word from coming to full
[1:15:50] manifestation
[1:15:52] says in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:15:55] this great first battle that was ever
[1:15:57] fought begin in heaven
[1:15:58] when michael and his angels fought
[1:16:00] against lucifer and his angels it
[1:16:01] started the first battle was in heaven
[1:16:03] so sin did not originate on earth it
[1:16:06] originated
[1:16:06] in heaven i want you to hold on to this
[1:16:09] for me with me for just a minute
[1:16:11] sin did not start in the garden of eden
[1:16:14] sin started in heaven
[1:16:15] when lucifer rebelled against the word
[1:16:17] of god and he got some of god's subjects
[1:16:21] to let down the bar on the word
[1:16:23] and those subjects were the angels that
[1:16:26] were deceived
[1:16:28] are we together sin did not originate on
[1:16:32] earth it originated in heaven
[1:16:34] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[1:16:36] cast out of heaven to the earth
[1:16:37] and fell on human beings then the battle
[1:16:40] from
[1:16:41] angels became human battles and satan
[1:16:44] come to destroy god's creation what god
[1:16:46] had created to be for himself
[1:16:48] he had satan come to destroy this that's
[1:16:51] what his purpose was was to destroy it
[1:16:54] then the battle began here on earth and
[1:16:56] begin in
[1:16:57] us it has been raging ever since
[1:17:01] so the battle become on earth and become
[1:17:03] in us
[1:17:04] and been raging ever since what's the
[1:17:06] battle the battles between
[1:17:08] satan and god's word god's word is in
[1:17:10] you
[1:17:11] amen you're born again by incorruptible
[1:17:13] seed by the word of god
[1:17:15] you are the manifestation of his word
[1:17:16] for this day and the battle is between
[1:17:19] that word and satan and he's got to get
[1:17:21] one subject to let down the bar on one
[1:17:23] word so that he can have another victory
[1:17:27] that's why the word had to be restored
[1:17:29] in this day because satan was having his
[1:17:31] way
[1:17:31] and then he built his satan's eden and
[1:17:34] he built a great conglomeration of
[1:17:36] religion and he was running all of
[1:17:38] all of religion don't make no mistake
[1:17:41] it's not like you know he's got the
[1:17:43] catholics but not the baptist
[1:17:45] he's got the baptism but not the
[1:17:47] pentecostals no it was all his design in
[1:17:49] the beginning
[1:17:50] religion was his design denomination was
[1:17:53] his design
[1:17:55] changing and altering the word by
[1:17:57] reasoning was his design from the
[1:17:59] beginning
[1:18:01] so whenever that happens it's his design
[1:18:04] his work
[1:18:05] he gets the preeminence in every one of
[1:18:07] those systems
[1:18:12] why you can't say well you know
[1:18:15] my so-and-so that i love at least
[1:18:16] they're not a catholic at least they're
[1:18:17] baptist
[1:18:25] it's all his design satan's eating his
[1:18:28] conglomeration of religion
[1:18:31] and so in the end time in order for god
[1:18:33] to have a great victory
[1:18:35] he's got to unlock his word
[1:18:39] has been bound up and he's got to give
[1:18:43] the true a perfect interpretation of the
[1:18:45] word
[1:18:46] so that the bride has the word so she's
[1:18:49] not
[1:18:49] letting down the bar on the word
[1:18:51] ignorantly anymore
[1:18:55] she knows the truth of predestination
[1:18:57] she knows the serpents see
[1:18:58] she knows the right water baptism she
[1:19:00] knows the oneness of the godhead she
[1:19:02] knows she knows she knows she knows
[1:19:04] so she cannot be deceived and trapped
[1:19:06] anymore into the false systems
[1:19:08] of man because that's
[1:19:11] satan's ideas get the victory over the
[1:19:13] word
[1:19:14] but god's calling out a word bride
[1:19:17] that'll stand
[1:19:18] upon the revealed word and she's looking
[1:19:22] to that prophet as she's marching
[1:19:27] because he's been given the correct
[1:19:28] interpretation of the word
[1:19:32] you understand when she looked at the
[1:19:34] other churches the ones going into ruins
[1:19:36] she got out of step
[1:19:37] with the word but when she kept her eyes
[1:19:39] amen on the seventh angel the one god
[1:19:42] used to bring the interpretation of the
[1:19:43] word and the opening of the seals when
[1:19:45] she kept her eyes there she kept
[1:19:46] marching in the step of the word
[1:19:51] so satan will try every tactic he can
[1:19:54] to get our eyes on the wrong thing amen
[1:19:57] so they can get us to step
[1:19:59] make make a misstep and get out of line
[1:20:01] from marching right in line with the
[1:20:02] word because if you get one subject to
[1:20:05] let down the bar on the word that's why
[1:20:07] i say
[1:20:07] stick with the message friends stick
[1:20:09] with the message read the books listen
[1:20:11] to the tapes
[1:20:12] know it for yourself god has given this
[1:20:16] message
[1:20:16] not to ministers he's given this message
[1:20:18] to his bride
[1:20:19] if you're his bride this message came to
[1:20:21] you
[1:20:23] it's not saying well we'll go to church
[1:20:25] and i'll let the pastor tell me what the
[1:20:26] message is no you the message is to you
[1:20:28] amen the fivefold ministry should just
[1:20:30] be a tool in god's hand
[1:20:32] amen to bring attention to the word to
[1:20:34] preach in such a way
[1:20:35] to catch clicker revelation in you amen
[1:20:38] but but the message wasn't given to the
[1:20:40] ministry and the ministry gives it to
[1:20:41] the people the message was given to the
[1:20:43] people
[1:20:45] don't let anything get between you and
[1:20:47] god
[1:20:49] no hierarchy no system amen this message
[1:20:52] was given to you
[1:20:53] stick with the message stick with the
[1:20:55] prophet read the books listen to the
[1:20:57] tapes
[1:20:57] amen in that way when you're sitting in
[1:20:59] a service amen and all of a sudden
[1:21:01] something just don't strike right
[1:21:02] amen then just just say i don't know i
[1:21:05] need to look at that again don't reject
[1:21:06] it don't call it false
[1:21:08] but don't depend on some other man to
[1:21:10] know the message for you
[1:21:14] you keep your eyes on that seventh angel
[1:21:16] amen keep watching him
[1:21:18] because he was the one who was given the
[1:21:19] word
[1:21:21] amen hallelujah
[1:21:24] why because the devil will bring any
[1:21:26] tactic a friend or somebody with another
[1:21:28] doctrine or some other way to get your
[1:21:30] eyes on the wrong thing and if you get
[1:21:32] your eyes on the wrong thing and get out
[1:21:34] of step with the word and then the devil
[1:21:36] can get another little victory over the
[1:21:37] word of god
[1:21:38] and he's prolonged his demise amen but
[1:21:40] there's a bride
[1:21:41] predestinated ordained to stand upon
[1:21:44] this word
[1:21:47] there is a predestinated bride that's
[1:21:49] going to take the word
[1:21:50] and the revelation it was given in and
[1:21:52] she is going to feed on it she's going
[1:21:54] to become one with it
[1:21:55] she's going to stand upon it and
[1:21:57] nothing's going to move her away from it
[1:22:00] even if she has to say like the
[1:22:01] disciples you know he said
[1:22:03] uh eat my flesh and drink my blood what
[1:22:05] does that mean and she may
[1:22:06] she may have to come to the same place
[1:22:08] the disciples came
[1:22:10] and said i don't know
[1:22:14] why is that such a horrible statement
[1:22:16] for a message believer
[1:22:19] brother branham says this this and this
[1:22:21] what does it mean
[1:22:23] i don't know is it true yep
[1:22:30] amen just receive the word from the
[1:22:34] vessel god sent to give the word to
[1:22:36] from and don't don't
[1:22:39] try to make it make sense when it
[1:22:42] doesn't make sense
[1:22:43] all you're going to do is twist the word
[1:22:46] if it doesn't make sense to you then
[1:22:48] just believe it and don't have to
[1:22:49] explain it
[1:22:53] and there's nothing wrong with talking
[1:22:54] about it asking questions there's
[1:22:56] nothing
[1:22:56] saying well i it could be this or it
[1:22:58] could be that there's nothing wrong with
[1:23:00] that as long as you don't start locking
[1:23:01] down on those things
[1:23:04] then you're going to wind up out of step
[1:23:06] because we're now we're not looking
[1:23:07] amen at the prophet anymore for the
[1:23:09] correct interpretation of the word
[1:23:11] now we're starting to use reasoning
[1:23:13] ourselves again
[1:23:15] to try to find a solution to the puzzle
[1:23:17] that's in the message
[1:23:20] do you understand what i'm saying that's
[1:23:23] a tactic of the devil
[1:23:26] stay with the prophet and if you see it
[1:23:28] by revelation then say it
[1:23:30] there's nothing wrong with that if you
[1:23:32] see sometimes one it'll just click and
[1:23:34] you've got it i know it that's it
[1:23:36] praise be to god you don't have to be
[1:23:38] afraid of the word either
[1:23:41] but just stick with that prophet friends
[1:23:44] know it for yourselves
[1:23:46] because the devil is trying to get one
[1:23:48] subject
[1:23:50] to let down on one word but there's a
[1:23:53] predestinated bride
[1:23:55] that won't fail on the word
[1:24:02] all kinds of tactics all kind of trips
[1:24:04] trips and traps and land mines
[1:24:07] th this this world this civilization
[1:24:10] all around you is covered with landmines
[1:24:14] tripwires and traps and all kinds of
[1:24:17] devices of the enemy
[1:24:19] all around you friends
[1:24:22] don't be scared you've got a shepherd
[1:24:26] don't be nervous you've got a father
[1:24:28] keep your eyes on that seventh angel
[1:24:30] keep marching and step with the word if
[1:24:32] you get off to the right or the left
[1:24:33] his rod and his staff they comfort you
[1:24:35] he'll keep you marching on the word
[1:24:37] because all of heaven is watching you
[1:24:41] depending on you to finish your part
[1:24:44] don't be nervous don't be scared
[1:24:49] let's look at colossians now i want to
[1:24:52] finish
[1:24:53] up by looking at two passages of
[1:24:56] scripture
[1:24:58] in galatia and colossians and then in
[1:25:00] hebrews colossians 1
[1:25:03] verse 15.
[1:25:09] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:25:11] the firstborn
[1:25:12] of every creature for by him were all
[1:25:16] things created in
[1:25:17] that are in heaven and that are in earth
[1:25:20] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:25:22] thrones or dominions
[1:25:24] or principalities our powers all things
[1:25:27] were created by him
[1:25:29] and for him and he is before all things
[1:25:32] and by him all things consist
[1:25:34] and he is the head of the body the
[1:25:36] church who is the beginning the
[1:25:37] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:25:39] things he might have
[1:25:41] the preeminences for it please the
[1:25:43] father that in him should all fullness
[1:25:45] dwell
[1:25:46] and having made peace through the blood
[1:25:49] of his cross
[1:25:50] through the blood of of his cross by him
[1:25:53] to reconcile
[1:25:54] all things unto himself by him i say
[1:25:56] whether they be things in earth or
[1:25:58] things in heaven
[1:25:59] and you that were sometimes alienated in
[1:26:01] enemies in your mind by wicked works yet
[1:26:03] now hath he reconciled
[1:26:05] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:26:07] to present you holy
[1:26:09] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:26:11] sight
[1:26:16] there's one statement i'd like to go
[1:26:17] back to verse 20 and catch
[1:26:19] there's a lot here i'd like to say but i
[1:26:21] want to go focus on verse 20.
[1:26:24] i'll read it again and having made peace
[1:26:27] through the blood of his cross
[1:26:28] by him to reconcile all things unto
[1:26:30] himself
[1:26:31] by him i say whether they be things in
[1:26:34] earth
[1:26:35] or things in heaven brother branham
[1:26:38] stops right here when he's reading this
[1:26:39] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:26:40] revealed and he makes this
[1:26:41] one statement he goes back to reading he
[1:26:43] said watch where that reconciliation
[1:26:45] went let's read it again
[1:26:49] whether they be things in earth or
[1:26:52] things
[1:26:53] in heaven
[1:26:56] christ was here reconciling
[1:27:00] all that was lost reconciling everything
[1:27:03] into himself and in that reconciliation
[1:27:08] he was here on earth living in a body of
[1:27:10] flesh he died
[1:27:12] on earth in that body of flesh that body
[1:27:14] of flesh
[1:27:15] bled it died amen but through that act
[1:27:19] somehow it was also reconciling
[1:27:21] something in heaven
[1:27:23] because sin didn't start on earth sin
[1:27:26] started in
[1:27:27] heaven and now he comes in the body of
[1:27:31] flesh
[1:27:32] to reconcile all things by him all
[1:27:35] things
[1:27:36] whether they be things on earth or
[1:27:38] things in heaven
[1:27:39] so now we know that what happens on
[1:27:41] earth is a reflection of heaven
[1:27:43] there's some tie in between the two and
[1:27:45] a reflection of one to the other
[1:27:47] and while jesus christ was here on earth
[1:27:50] living a life in flesh
[1:27:51] amen to live the full word and to die
[1:27:53] the death
[1:27:54] in place of all the predestinated seed
[1:27:57] somehow
[1:27:58] that act on earth was also reconciling
[1:28:01] something that was wrong in heaven
[1:28:04] something wrong in heaven something
[1:28:06] wrong in heaven
[1:28:09] i want to say that and hopefully i can
[1:28:10] show you out of the word what i'm trying
[1:28:12] to say
[1:28:13] when lucifer rebelled against god that
[1:28:15] was a terrible blow in heaven
[1:28:18] you realize it was it was a devastating
[1:28:21] thing that took place
[1:28:23] in heaven lucifer was a covering cherub
[1:28:27] amen one of two that covered over the
[1:28:29] mercy seat amen
[1:28:31] and and he rebelled from that place
[1:28:32] brother bam said his right hand man
[1:28:34] equal to god in all ways except creation
[1:28:38] and when he fell in the word and brought
[1:28:40] a deception that caused angels to fall
[1:28:43] amen that was a shock and a blow that
[1:28:45] hit heaven
[1:28:48] and he was cast out but now
[1:28:51] jesus christ is here on earth living out
[1:28:54] the word
[1:28:55] obedience to the word coming down in
[1:28:58] flesh
[1:28:59] i don't know how it works i don't know
[1:29:01] how to make it make sense
[1:29:02] to the human mind it may never make
[1:29:04] sense but something about this earthly
[1:29:07] journey
[1:29:07] something about living the word
[1:29:09] something about fulfilling
[1:29:11] uh all the word and dying amen
[1:29:14] is not just fixing what's wrong on earth
[1:29:17] but it's also reconciling heaven
[1:29:23] this matters let's go to hebrews and
[1:29:26] i'll lay this down too and hopefully god
[1:29:29] gives us some insight
[1:29:33] hebrews chapter 9.
[1:29:41] i i i hope that
[1:29:45] i don't know what i hope i'll just say
[1:29:48] what's on my heart and i hope it comes
[1:29:49] across right
[1:29:51] because we realize the heavenly realm is
[1:29:53] is there's something wrong
[1:29:57] because there was sin originated there
[1:29:59] lucifer rebelled there
[1:30:01] now there's still an accuser of the
[1:30:02] brethren that has access to heaven
[1:30:04] and will not be cast out until the bride
[1:30:06] goes up and when the bride goes up he
[1:30:08] comes down
[1:30:08] and he's there as accuser of the brother
[1:30:10] accusing day and night
[1:30:13] so how is he there there's something
[1:30:15] wrong in heaven
[1:30:16] if lucifer's still there accusing
[1:30:20] and remember when god had a message to
[1:30:22] give to gabriel gabriel sent out a
[1:30:24] message to daniel
[1:30:25] but gabriel was prevented from getting
[1:30:27] to daniel
[1:30:28] because there was a spiritual power
[1:30:32] a prince a supernatural force
[1:30:35] that was resisting gabriel an angel
[1:30:38] a messenger from god so there's
[1:30:41] something going on in the supernatural
[1:30:43] realm that we don't understand or see
[1:30:45] there's warfare there's battles there's
[1:30:47] hierarchies there's resistance
[1:30:48] there's principalities and powers both
[1:30:51] visible and
[1:30:52] invisible so the heavenlies
[1:30:55] if we say the heavenly uh the the
[1:30:59] the other dimension that we don't see
[1:31:02] let's just say it this way
[1:31:03] the supernatural the spiritual
[1:31:07] now they're still powers and forces and
[1:31:10] principalities
[1:31:12] there was a prince of babylon in the
[1:31:15] supernatural
[1:31:16] that had dominion over babylon that
[1:31:18] could resist
[1:31:19] gabriel gabriel was sent from the
[1:31:21] presence of the lord
[1:31:22] to bring a message to his prophet daniel
[1:31:24] because daniel asked a question
[1:31:26] you would think god has the power just
[1:31:28] to penetrate and do whatever he wants
[1:31:31] but somehow god has set up laws he's got
[1:31:34] he's got laws that he operates by
[1:31:36] he's got something in place amen that
[1:31:38] allows this
[1:31:39] prince over babylon to have the power to
[1:31:42] resist gabriel
[1:31:44] and gabriel could not overcome until he
[1:31:46] goes back and gets michael
[1:31:47] and michael and gabriel together
[1:31:49] overcome and get the message to daniel
[1:31:54] i would venture to say heaven needs to
[1:31:57] be reconciled
[1:32:02] whatever went wrong has to be made right
[1:32:06] on earth and in heaven
[1:32:10] now what all that means how it all works
[1:32:13] i don't know i'm just showing you the
[1:32:15] bible
[1:32:17] there's something there that's still
[1:32:21] in warfare there's something there
[1:32:25] says we war not against flesh and blood
[1:32:27] but about principalities and powers
[1:32:29] in heavenly places that means in the
[1:32:31] heavens
[1:32:33] principalities and powers in the heavens
[1:32:35] that we're warring against
[1:32:37] but i'm here on earth resisting this
[1:32:39] temptation in front of me
[1:32:40] i'm here on earth trying to keep the
[1:32:42] word for this decision no you're not
[1:32:44] warring an earthly battle you're
[1:32:45] fighting a principality and power
[1:32:47] in heaven and the heavenlies
[1:32:50] in the heavenly realm so now we realize
[1:32:53] our existence here
[1:32:55] this is what i want to get to us there's
[1:32:57] everything at stake on this bride coming
[1:33:00] to the full manifestation of this word
[1:33:02] everything at stake there's still
[1:33:04] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:33:06] places that are resisting the bride
[1:33:08] they're still forces at work amen there
[1:33:10] are still things on this earth
[1:33:12] and jesus christ is reconciling in the
[1:33:14] body of his flesh
[1:33:16] all things whether they be in heaven or
[1:33:17] in earth
[1:33:20] and we've been given a ministry of
[1:33:22] reconciliation
[1:33:24] we are ambassadors for christ we are
[1:33:26] finishing the work that he started
[1:33:29] that's why all heaven is behind you and
[1:33:31] i
[1:33:33] we're not going to be defeated heaven's
[1:33:34] not going to lose
[1:33:36] god has had a plan and he's unfolded his
[1:33:38] plan he's going to he was going to have
[1:33:40] seven ages because he said before he
[1:33:42] would have seven ages and he's going to
[1:33:43] have seven ages
[1:33:45] not eight not six
[1:33:48] when he comes to the end he's going to
[1:33:50] call out a bride he's going to call her
[1:33:52] out by the word she's going to hear his
[1:33:53] voice
[1:33:54] and come running from the fig leaves and
[1:33:55] come to him and be clothed in his
[1:33:57] righteousness which is his word
[1:33:59] she's going to by predestination by his
[1:34:02] choice she's going to accept all of the
[1:34:04] word she's going to keep her eyes on
[1:34:06] that seventh angel messenger she's going
[1:34:07] to march right in step to the word
[1:34:09] and when every one of those attributes
[1:34:11] come to full revelation and
[1:34:12] manifestation of that word
[1:34:14] amen and satan can no longer get one
[1:34:16] subject to let down on one bar
[1:34:18] something is going to shift friends
[1:34:22] something is going to change
[1:34:28] what's all heaven waiting on us
[1:34:33] brother branham said it but i want to
[1:34:35] show in the scripture it's there's
[1:34:36] there's more than what we can think and
[1:34:39] what we can imagine
[1:34:40] when he says they're waiting on us oh
[1:34:42] heaven is waiting on us
[1:34:44] the reconciliation of heaven earth is
[1:34:46] waiting on us amen it's got to have a
[1:34:48] bride of his own choosing that stands on
[1:34:50] the word
[1:34:50] to prove that she won't fall fail like
[1:34:52] eve fell then he can take her out of the
[1:34:54] way
[1:34:55] go to 144 000. they'll take the word and
[1:34:57] stand on the word which will complete
[1:34:59] redemption for the jews from the time of
[1:35:00] christ on
[1:35:01] then he'll burn the earth over then
[1:35:03] we'll have a millennial reign for a
[1:35:04] thousand years
[1:35:07] see none of that happens if there's not
[1:35:09] a bride to express the word
[1:35:11] then after a thousand years there's a
[1:35:13] resurrection of the dead and at the
[1:35:14] resurrection of the dead there's a
[1:35:16] judgment set the bride's not going to be
[1:35:18] judged she's going to be the one judging
[1:35:21] the husband and wife will be sitting on
[1:35:22] the throne you can sit with me in my
[1:35:24] throne
[1:35:26] you know you're not you shall judge the
[1:35:27] angels this is all the scriptures
[1:35:30] we're standing there in judgment and
[1:35:31] people are coming up and there's going
[1:35:33] to be people
[1:35:34] amen who's going to receive eternal life
[1:35:36] having never named the name of christ
[1:35:38] because of the good deeds they did to
[1:35:39] the elect
[1:35:44] but do you realize their entrance into
[1:35:46] eternal life will never come until this
[1:35:48] bride expresses the word
[1:35:50] millennium will never come 144 000 never
[1:35:53] come
[1:35:53] everything now everything is hinged
[1:35:57] on you and i keeping the word
[1:36:01] the reconciliation of heaven of earth
[1:36:04] everything is wrapped up down to this
[1:36:06] one thing
[1:36:07] you and i believing this word and
[1:36:09] standing on the word
[1:36:11] this isn't our pastime this isn't
[1:36:13] something that we do on the side
[1:36:14] we're not a mechanic and we believe the
[1:36:16] message no everything in our lives is
[1:36:19] for us to believe this word and keep
[1:36:20] this word
[1:36:22] and all heaven is behind us
[1:36:25] let's go to hebrews 9. i just want to
[1:36:27] show this in the bible
[1:36:29] for jesus hebrews 9
[1:36:33] and 19.
[1:36:38] hebrews 9 19 for when moses had spoken
[1:36:42] every precept to all the people
[1:36:44] according to the law
[1:36:45] he took the blood of calves and of goats
[1:36:47] with water
[1:36:48] and scarlet wool and hyssop and
[1:36:51] sprinkled both the book and all the
[1:36:52] people
[1:36:53] saying this is the blood of the
[1:36:55] testament which god hath enjoined unto
[1:36:57] you
[1:36:58] moreover he sprinkled with the blood
[1:37:00] both the tabernacle
[1:37:01] and all the vessels of the ministry and
[1:37:04] almost all things are by the law purged
[1:37:06] with blood
[1:37:07] and without shedding of blood there's no
[1:37:09] remission of sins
[1:37:11] it was therefore necessary that the
[1:37:13] patterns of these things in heaven
[1:37:15] should be purified with these but the
[1:37:18] heavenly things themselves with better
[1:37:20] sacrifice
[1:37:20] than these for christ has not entered
[1:37:24] into the holy place
[1:37:25] made with hands which are the figures of
[1:37:27] the truth
[1:37:28] but unto heaven itself now to appear in
[1:37:31] the presence of god
[1:37:32] for us i want to pay close attention to
[1:37:36] the last two verses i read
[1:37:37] 23 and 24. it was therefore necessary
[1:37:42] that the pattern of things in heaven
[1:37:45] should be purified so the pattern
[1:37:46] was the earthly tabernacle the book
[1:37:50] and the people and the tabernacle and
[1:37:52] the vessels
[1:37:53] had to all be sprinkled by blood to be
[1:37:55] purged
[1:37:57] so it was necessary that the pattern of
[1:37:59] things in heaven should be purified with
[1:38:01] these
[1:38:02] but the heavenly things themselves with
[1:38:05] better sacrifices than these
[1:38:11] i want to ask you why does the
[1:38:14] heavenlies
[1:38:15] need to be purged
[1:38:18] that's what he's saying he's saying the
[1:38:22] heavenly things themselves with better
[1:38:24] sacrifice than these you can't use the
[1:38:27] blood of bulls and goats to purge that
[1:38:32] meaning something in the heavenlies had
[1:38:35] to be purged
[1:38:37] because sin started in heaven something
[1:38:40] needed to be purged in heaven
[1:38:42] christ coming here on earth he came here
[1:38:44] on earth he lived in the body of flesh
[1:38:46] he died
[1:38:47] amen and then he went up amen and there
[1:38:50] was a purging taking place not just on
[1:38:52] earth but in heaven also
[1:38:53] i don't know the mechanics i can't
[1:38:55] explain it but what i'm telling you
[1:38:57] is something on earth can be taking
[1:38:58] place that will reconcile heaven and
[1:39:00] earth together
[1:39:01] and we're here in this body of flesh to
[1:39:03] continue the work that he didn't finish
[1:39:05] and we've been given a ministry of
[1:39:06] reconciliation
[1:39:10] it's not just about what's going on
[1:39:12] right around you in your circle
[1:39:15] it's more than just what you see with
[1:39:17] your eyes
[1:39:18] it's more than just what you experience
[1:39:20] amen in a carnal way of living this life
[1:39:23] there's something far more going on in
[1:39:25] our lives friends than we ever realize
[1:39:31] christ the high priest
[1:39:34] had to carry his blood
[1:39:37] into heaven the heavenlies
[1:39:41] needed to be purged i don't understand
[1:39:45] it
[1:39:46] i can't comprehend it other than that's
[1:39:48] where sin started
[1:39:50] and now he's working in and through the
[1:39:53] bride
[1:39:54] to finish his work what is his work
[1:39:58] the ministry of reconciliation to
[1:40:00] reconcile
[1:40:01] everything back to christ
[1:40:05] heaven is depending on us friends
[1:40:09] all the realms are depending on us
[1:40:12] the dimensions the things seen the
[1:40:14] things unseen
[1:40:16] it's all depending on us god promised it
[1:40:20] he promised it to be here he
[1:40:23] predestinated it
[1:40:24] it's here it will manifest
[1:40:29] she will stand on that word
[1:40:34] brother bam said
[1:40:38] when he came to earth the mystery of god
[1:40:39] revealed he was the tree of life
[1:40:42] do you believe that in rome what did
[1:40:45] they do
[1:40:46] he had to be chopped down he was put on
[1:40:48] a tree of disgrace cursed is he that
[1:40:50] hang on a tree
[1:40:52] become a curse for the human race and
[1:40:54] now through that he brings forth a bride
[1:40:56] tree which will be the tree of life
[1:40:57] restored
[1:40:58] back to him as husband and wife in the
[1:41:01] garden of eden
[1:41:03] by the same word the same god made
[1:41:06] manifest in husband
[1:41:08] and wife and the same bride tree
[1:41:11] back again
[1:41:15] i want to read revelation 22 together
[1:41:23] revelation 22 1
[1:41:26] we know this is after the millennium
[1:41:28] after the final burning and purging
[1:41:30] new heavens and new earth are here and
[1:41:33] the city has descended and resting upon
[1:41:35] the mountain
[1:41:36] in revelation 22 he said and he showed
[1:41:38] me a pure river of water of life clears
[1:41:41] crystal proceeding out of the throne of
[1:41:42] god and of the lamb
[1:41:44] in the midst of the street in either
[1:41:46] side of the river
[1:41:47] was there the tree of life which were
[1:41:50] twelve manner of fruits and
[1:41:51] yielded her fruit every month and the
[1:41:53] leaves of the tree were for the healing
[1:41:56] of the nations brother branham said
[1:42:00] that they'll come from outside the city
[1:42:03] in that great new heavens and new earth
[1:42:06] and they'll come from outside the city
[1:42:07] and the gates will be open all the time
[1:42:09] and they'll bring their tithe and
[1:42:10] offering into the city
[1:42:11] and they'll come into the city and in
[1:42:13] exchange for that they'll take
[1:42:15] of the tree of life a leaf and they'll
[1:42:17] go back out
[1:42:18] and they'll have peace no more war no
[1:42:20] more bloodshed no more troubles
[1:42:24] before they can ever come to that place
[1:42:28] there has to be a restoration of the
[1:42:29] bride tree
[1:42:32] before we can ever get there where all
[1:42:35] those that are saved at the white throne
[1:42:37] judgment
[1:42:37] can come in and take of the leaves of
[1:42:40] the tree of life
[1:42:41] there's got to be a bride tree restored
[1:42:42] back to a bridegroom tree
[1:42:45] the two have to become one there's got
[1:42:47] to be an expression
[1:42:48] of the tree of life restored back to him
[1:42:50] again and if we don't have that now
[1:42:53] it'll never be there then
[1:42:57] you realize all the nations and all the
[1:43:00] people that will be saved at white
[1:43:02] throne judgment
[1:43:04] are depending on the restoration of the
[1:43:06] tree of life
[1:43:09] heavens and earth the predestinated
[1:43:13] the elect in the sixth dimension
[1:43:17] they're depending on us all those that
[1:43:19] will be saved at white thorn judgment
[1:43:21] they're depending on the restoration of
[1:43:22] the bride tree
[1:43:24] when the tree of life will come back
[1:43:25] together again
[1:43:28] this is the hour this is the moment and
[1:43:30] this is our place
[1:43:33] brother remember says christ is the
[1:43:35] mystery of god revealed he said
[1:43:36] predestinated
[1:43:38] there's the mystery he before christ or
[1:43:40] anything else was ever on earth you see
[1:43:42] his great mystery that he chose the
[1:43:44] bride knowing eve would fall from
[1:43:46] disbelieving the word
[1:43:47] knowing that she would fall but he would
[1:43:49] choose a bride that would
[1:43:51] not fall would not
[1:43:54] fall are you chosen are you the chosen
[1:43:56] bride of the end time
[1:43:58] he didn't choose a bride that will fall
[1:43:59] this time he chose a bride that will
[1:44:01] not fall this time why because the
[1:44:04] nations are depending on the tree of
[1:44:05] life being restored
[1:44:08] because heaven and earth amen is
[1:44:10] depending on everything coming to the
[1:44:12] finish line
[1:44:16] he predestinated he would choose a bride
[1:44:18] that would not fall
[1:44:19] that would hold to that word regardless
[1:44:22] of what all the rest of the world had to
[1:44:24] say about it
[1:44:24] they would hold to that word they are
[1:44:26] predestinated to stand there the
[1:44:28] adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:44:31] predestinated the church to that great
[1:44:33] glorious
[1:44:34] stand i want to say friends
[1:44:38] stand on the word not on anybody's idea
[1:44:43] not on anybody's concept but stand on
[1:44:45] the word
[1:44:46] keep your eyes on that seventh angel
[1:44:47] keep marching to the step of the word
[1:44:49] there's a lot more at stake than we ever
[1:44:52] realized there's a lot more depending
[1:44:54] on each individual each subject holding
[1:44:57] true to that word of god amen there's a
[1:44:59] lot more depending on that than we ever
[1:45:00] thought
[1:45:03] no more compromise no more laziness no
[1:45:06] more bowing down
[1:45:07] just a constant saying god have your way
[1:45:09] god have your way
[1:45:11] every day in my life have your way amen
[1:45:13] everything is waiting on this bride to
[1:45:15] take that
[1:45:16] last glorious stand and god is working
[1:45:19] all the circumstances all around us
[1:45:23] every circumstance from every angle he's
[1:45:25] trying to get that bride into that
[1:45:27] position to take that stand
[1:45:30] you say that how do i know what to do
[1:45:32] you'll know what to do
[1:45:35] how do i know should i do this or should
[1:45:37] i do that he's not going to leave it up
[1:45:39] to chance friends
[1:45:40] he's not going to leave it up to some
[1:45:42] mystery i don't know what to do he's
[1:45:44] gonna put you in a position where you
[1:45:45] have no choice but to take the word
[1:45:48] and then the next situation will come
[1:45:49] along no choice but to take the word and
[1:45:51] it'll keep rolling like that
[1:45:53] until every attribute has had victory by
[1:45:56] the word amen
[1:45:58] and then satan's defeated no more
[1:46:01] deception
[1:46:02] no more lie and the cycle rolls on
[1:46:06] because we did what he called us to do
[1:46:10] he chose a bride that won't fall
[1:46:15] i hope doesn't free you to sin i hope
[1:46:19] that frees you
[1:46:19] from bondage hope that puts peace in
[1:46:23] your heart and say

[1:46:54] the world is falling apart
[1:46:56] it's right on time amen

[1:52:33] [Music]

[1:53:29] [Applause]
[1:53:39] word is manifest
[1:53:42] in me living pure
[1:53:46] and holy on
[1:53:49] to thee this longing in my
[1:54:03] praise the lord i just want to remind
[1:54:05] you all we have communion service
[1:54:07] communion defeat washington this
[1:54:08] afternoon we'll gather back here at 3
[1:54:10] 30.
[1:54:11] so we look forward to seeing you there i
[1:54:14] just like to say
[1:54:16] if god could take the blinders off of
[1:54:19] our eyes
[1:54:20] if for a moment we could see all the
[1:54:24] realms the heavens the earth the whole
[1:54:26] plan
[1:54:26] everything and how much of it is
[1:54:28] centered on each one of us as individual
[1:54:30] attributes
[1:54:32] if we could just have that glimpse and
[1:54:34] see it and know it
[1:54:36] and understand it i think every day
[1:54:39] would give us a focus a commitment
[1:54:43] to stay true to this word but god's
[1:54:46] structured in such a way
[1:54:48] that we have to come and not have that
[1:54:50] vision
[1:54:52] because it's going to be by the word and
[1:54:54] the word only
[1:54:56] it's going to be because the word is
[1:54:59] calling to the word and the word is
[1:55:00] responding to the word
[1:55:02] and god has made a mechanism which his
[1:55:04] promise will be sure
[1:55:05] and that's going to be by the word
[1:55:09] and for us we may not be able to fathom
[1:55:13] how much is going on in the heavens how
[1:55:14] much warfare all around us
[1:55:16] how much resistance and fight over us
[1:55:19] just fulfilling our portion we may not
[1:55:22] be able to see the great
[1:55:23] power that is backing us and pushing us
[1:55:26] into manifestations where we may not be
[1:55:27] able to see that
[1:55:30] but we don't need to god's given us
[1:55:33] everything we need to overcome and he's
[1:55:34] given us his word
[1:55:37] and he's given us something to believe
[1:55:38] that word and he's given a spirit to
[1:55:41] manifest that word
[1:55:42] and now our victory comes one decision
[1:55:46] at a time by staying with that word
[1:55:50] and god will have complete absolute
[1:55:54] victory in you and i because he said he
[1:55:57] would
[1:55:59] i don't know about you but i want to
[1:56:00] make a fresh
[1:56:02] fresh declaration that i want him to
[1:56:03] have preeminence in me
[1:56:05] i want you to move freely in me lord not
[1:56:07] my own thinking interrupt my own
[1:56:09] thinking with your word
[1:56:10] show me your word and let me live it

[1:56:14] for everything is dependent on that
