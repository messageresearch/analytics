started getting into the real heart of his message and this time he's going to jump right into it so I'm ready I'm all geared up and ready to take a Jump Right In amen no lead up amen you guys can go ahead and have your seats for just a few moments before we go into the review just for a second I want to remind you that the uh uh Church age Bible study will be here in the fellowship hall uh tomorrow night if we could go ahead and pull up the PowerPoint that would be great also I want to uh take our books and just I want to review just one or two uh little quotes here to keep us fresh of where we where we are in the message before we move on um if you go to page 10 in your book if you open your book and go to page 10 and go down halfway down to paragraph 47 I want to read paragraph 47 and 48 just to catch the and remind ourselves of the theme that brother Ben was talking about now we know the message is the Masterpiece he preached this July 5th of 1964 and so in paragraph 47 he says but finally there came forth upon the earth a Perfection and that was a man and he's speaking of Jesus Christ and then he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was the reflection of what his creator was oh no I'm sorry this is Adam I'm sorry he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was and God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image and then I might say to this that when he made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself he was the Eternal and the man now in the image of God also existed on Earth by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on his left side and from there he took the piece that struck off of it and made him a help meat a wife then he wasn't by himself he was he had somebody with him and that's his great work amen so let's go over here to paragraph 51 on the next page top of page 11 so we see that that he after he had made his Masterpiece he placed it up up here on the Earth and put it in the most beautiful place there was in the Garden of Eden he placed his Masterpiece the two being one in the Garden of Eden how it must have pleased him that he saw his Masterpiece was well he after that we find out that he rested he was so well pleased with his work now remember that my opinion the Masterpiece is the stroke that marred St Angelo's uh Moses Masterpiece in the monument and it was the stroke that cut the side of his Masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see him as a masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden how beautiful it was and it so pleased him till he took his rest in he said I'll rest so we see now God was foreshadowing in his first Masterpiece amen The Great Masterpiece that he's finishing in this day amen he showed it in his first son that he made And that son was a masterpiece it was a it was a piece that reflected the artist it reflected God himself and now he had a reflection upon the Earth but he saw that there wasn't something quite right I love that because God's the one who did it he's the one who made it he's the one who fashioned it and when he saw it wasn't quite right it it showed that God never failed in any of his works it wasn't that he made a mistake amen he did this in a way so that we could see he wasn't complete yet he wasn't quite finished he didn't go to his rest cuz he had some more work to do as the great sculptor and so in order to finish his Masterpiece it was a masterpiece yes but not the total vision what he had in his mind so what he did is he struck a little blow and he took from it a rib and he made a second part of the Masterpiece amen from a piece off of the first one amen and then he United the two back together and now they were a masterpiece family now his great work the two being one he placed it in Eden and now he could take his rest because he couldn't rest till he was done so we're all on the same page we see what the Masterpiece was and so then we're going to find out as we begin that the Masterpiece was marred it fell amen but God wasn't going to let it stay that way because he came and left his rest to go back to work to remake the Masterpiece once again and that happens to we happen to be in the final rubbing down of that work amen praise God that's so good so we're going to begin at the bottom of page 11 and we're going to begin at the beginning of paragraph 56 uh this evening and we're going to go all the way to page 25 all the way to the very bottom to the last sentence on page 25 so I'm going to go through our questions for this time also want to let you know that uh I I mentioned before that brother brandom had an interview a private interview just before he came out and preached this message and that was with sister Georgia Bruce and it's the O as far as I know the only recorded private interview that we have and so he's going to refer to that I said last time it would be the last time but it's not it's this time and so when he gets to that and he refers he Saidi had that on a private interview a little bit ago you know which private interview you were with this is one of the few times there's many times brother Brenham mentions the private interviews in his sermon but this is the first time we can go back and hear exactly what he said in the private interview and he was talking to her because she she never had a definite experience of being sealed with the Holy Ghost and she wanted God to speak it to brother bram's heart but he come and told her whatever it was that changed you from your first nature and it changed you to what you are now he said who did that she said Christ he said there you are sister that's it and so when he refers to that it'll be good that that's still in your mind all right let's let's go to our questions so you can jot these down uh question number one why did God change to an unconditional Covenant why did God change to an unconditional Covenant we know that it wasn't originally that way um because his original Covenant was uh the original Covenant was if you if you don't eat of this tree you'll be saved but if you eat of the tree uh that day you'll die so the original Covenant was on condition and it was on condition of obedience so it was a conditional Covenant do we understand that so God changed it to an unconditional Covenant and we want to know why all right next question there's three parts there's an A B and C to this question I don't know if that's cheating I don't know if that's three questions or one question but you'll see they go together what is the foundation of the Masterpiece so there's a foundation it sits on what is the foundation of the Masterpiece that's a Part B what makes up the body of the Masterpiece so what makes up the body and part see what is the head so it's all the Masterpiece what what is the foundation what makes up the body and what is the head of this masterpiece amen question number three what does the what does the Old and New Testament represent now when I when I give you this question if I just gave you this question unrelated to this message there's many things that you could answer there there's not one answer that fits but I'm talking in relation to what brother Bam's going to use how he's going to use it in this message what does the Old and New Testament represent here as he gets to it here in the Masterpiece what does the Old and New Testament represent and then question number four what does the three stages of wheat development produce what does the three stages of wheat development produce all right give you a second get those wrote down all right now as we get started I'd like to read through our scripture again because I don't want us to lose sight of the scripture brother Brenham opened with so if you could take out your Bibles and let's just stand for the reading of the scripture and go to Isaiah 53 because brother Brenham took this as his context for the this message out of Isaiah 53 verse 1 Isaiah chap 53 verse 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed I love how brother Benham answers this in another message who hath believed the report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed the arm of the Lord is the Deliverance strength power and authority of God who is the arm of the Lord revealed to those that believe the report praise the Lord so that's you and I we've believed his report who has believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground Heath no form nor comeliness and when we see when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord ha laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgressions of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide a portion him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he ha poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors praise God we'll let you be seated brother Venom when he reads that we just see what an amazing scripture and description to be begin with the Masterpiece despised rejected Afflicted it's amazing so if you want to take your books now and turn to page 11 down to paragraph 56 we can go ahead and bring up the the message and we'll go ahead and start right there but the great sculpture when he seen the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruined he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he's God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again unto his own image a man now we find that the Andel luian world come along and destroyed the whole thing because the covenants that was made was made conditionally if you will not do this or if you will do that God the great sculpture seen that man could not could not keep a covenant he just can't do it there's just no way at all on the interview a few moments ago I was speaking to a person in the room it's present now I said but brother brandom I have so many things that I I know that's wrong in a a Godly little woman I said but but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you try to do and if you really love the Lord you try to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord Jesus he made a way so he began now taking man from uh his covenants of of saying that if you will I will and he began with the man called Abraham and give to Abraham a covenant unconditionally every time he'd start a masterpiece Satan would get it because the word but when he started with Abraham he said I have already done it now this is unconditionally not what that that if you will I will but I've already done it now he the the sculpture is Determan to have this masterpiece then from Abraham come the Patriarchs and the Patriarchs really now what's God doing he's rebuilding this masterpiece that have fallen so in the Patriarchs the first we find was Abraham now watch every Masterpiece is put on a foundation a sculpture Angelo's uh Monument of Moses on three or 4ot piece of marble it's got a foundation so God in preparing this masterpiece he put it on a foundation of the Patriarchs and the patriarch Foundation First was Abraham then Isaac then Jacob then Joseph the four corners and now Abraham was the foundation of faith that said had four foundations the foundation of Faith was Abraham the foundation of love was Isaac the foundation of Grace was Jacob God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that but in Joseph was Perfection there's where he could set the monument up all not the First Foundation the second Foundation third Foundation but on the fourth Foundation Abraham portrayed Christ of course so did Isaac in love Abraham did in faith Isaac did in love Jacob did by his grace because Jacob means deceiver and that's what he was but God's grace is with him but when it come to Joseph there's nothing against him just one little scratch for the foundation must also be a masterpiece when he told his father the prophet say to Pharaoh that your people are are cattle raisers they not Shepherds because a Shepherd is an Abomination uh to the Egyptian but when the old prophet got before Pharaoh he said your servants are Hersman so it's scratched it see that's what still makes it the Masterpiece now the foundations is laid through faith love Grace and to Perfection through the Patriarchs now the Bodywork that come on to this Great Masterpiece was the prophets which was the word I hope you can read it the prophets not the laws the prophets for the prophets was the Vindicated word which makes the body not the p Patriarchs the prophets they were the word finally as he started way back in the days of Moses and come down through the prophets to each one and finally building up the body coming closer all the time and the greatest of all of them was John the Bible said so Jesus said it there's not a man ever born of a woman as great as John the Baptist amen for he was the one that could introduce the word and then come finally the great head the head of all of it the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of all of it Jesus Jesus came on the scene there when this headpiece was put up on it we find in him the entire handiwork of God we find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word the fullness of the word now again God has the perfect Masterpiece again as I is said behold my servant my masterpiece that I have portrayed through all the ages of this perfect one coming in here he stands right before me a perfect there in his own image reflecting God for he said in St John 14 when you see me you see the father and then in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was heed out and reflected what the word was at the beginning him the word reflected in the Masterpiece in his own likeness God back again in his own likeness the word form being reflected in the image of a man the Masterpiece all the prophets had flaws all the ones was a potion but here at last coming up through that finally comes the master piece the perfect one no fault in him at all amen so perfect reflected of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in his work God and Christ were one in so much until he put his own Spirit into him and then even the image and the Builder became one God and His sculpture work his Masterpiece where MOS Moses was in the work of St Angelo was a or Michelangelo rather was a uh sculpture work that was dead because it been made out of stone but you're the master builder when he got his handiwork perfected he stepped into it Hallelujah so perfected a redeemer of man so perfect so Godly yet there was no Beauty we should desire him when this virgin born son of the Living God become so perfect and humble and in the image of God until the Great Master who had brought his life up through the prophets and he was the fulfilling of all the prophets he was so perfect until God seeing this he smoked him and cried out speak as Michelangelo did speak you say is that so St Mark 9:7 we find upon on the mount Transfiguration when there stood Moses the law there stood Elijah the prophets all the way back from the Patriarchs the fathers the law the prophets and all of them stand there we hear a voice coming down from the cloud and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him and if they're going to hear he's got to speak just a few days before he was smitten amen this is my son who I'm pleased to dwell in I have molded him I've been 4,000 years bringing him to this amen and now he is so perfect I've got to Smite him so he can speak amen hear ye him he's the perfected one he he is the Masterpiece remember he was portrayed all times back through the Old Testament we find him being The Rock in the wilderness that was smitten Rock in the wilderness I am that rock that was in the wilderness but that was a stone it had not come to its Perfection yet but in tight form it it followed the church to draw from it that that he could draw give life to those who he could give life to but he was that rock in the wilderness he had not been made man yet he was only intip Moses saw him standing on this rock he saw him pass by and he said it's the back part of a man you see the sculpture was presenting to Moses which was was a potential image of Christ what the Great Masterpiece would look like when it was perfected he passed his he injected or or projected to Moses the vision of what the Masterpiece was going to look like it was the back part of a man when it passed by in the wilderness remember Angelo could only cry out and smile might the image and say speak but how different it was to God the great sculpture when he made a man in his own image so perfect that reflected him God spoke through the image of man showing what he would do he spoke through the prophets as they were in their potential image as his bringing up to the head but when he come in the head he was all the image of God Amen he was portraying himself then smitten for us now he is the Masterpiece to us the gift of God Jesus Christ eternal life I hope we never forget that as we see the days darkening as we see the Shadows falling when I predicted just a few more turns of the sun this nation's gone do you know yesterday Fourth of July Thomas Jefferson had signed the Declaration of Independence him and the other uh board that was with him and the liberty bell rang and we was declared an independence as a nation according to history there has never been a democracy at any time last over 200 years and that was 1776 July the 4th and we're just 11 years left will it make it no can't 11 years and if it does it'll break all history and we see the condition of time we see the condition of the people we see the condition of politics we see the condition of the world it can't stand it's got to sink like the Titanic it must go down for there's give room one nation gives room to another as it falls and this Kingdom Must Fall in every other Kingdom to give room to that Kingdom that's coming which cannot Paul while we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved through this perfect image of God the Masterpiece God when he looked upon him he was so inspired he was so to seem the way he looked and to see the the form of him he was so inspired that it would be the perfect Masterpiece of a redeemer Jesus the Redeemer so God in order to be smitten himself because to pay his own penalty God and Christ became one so God could be smoked in the image he could be scarred and that's why Isaiah said we did esteem him smitten and Afflicted of God yet he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the Chas of our pieces upon him and with his stripes we were healed the perfect image of God man God and and Maria had changed from Supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death God's perfect Masterpiece he could not do it in Moses he could not do it in the prophets Isaiah who was saw with saws till he was saw to Pieces he could not do it in the prophets that were stoned he could not do it because he couldn't feel it there was just a potion of him but in this perfect Masterpiece he was the fullness of a godhead bodily he can not only project Moses he can project his entire being into this person and taste death for the whole human race God's perfect Masterpiece God so inspired by seeing it he become the Redeemer of all ages to speak for those in the backgrounds who had been before and now all promises was met in him he was the Perfection of the perfection all types is fulfilled in him our kinsman redeemer and Ruth and Boaz our lawgiver from Mount siia our Prophet from the Wilderness as he come from the mountain as he come from the Wilderness as he come from eternity and become man The Perfect Image God down through the age heeing Away by the Patriarchs and madees platform and brought him up from the different things that he laid this Foundation upon upon this he begin to build his word the prophets and then finally come out to the perfect Prophet the perfect Foundation the perfect vision God had now in order for this to speak he is the word and for the word to speak he must come into the image and then for the image to speak is got to be smitten amen Lord he comes into the image and then in order to speak the perfect Redeemer all the types of the Old Testament was met in him as I said the other day Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new yes like many of you man women my age we used to have around the country a lot of Chinese laundries when the Chinese first started in they come from the West Coast moving Eastward coming over from the Eastern country moving this way and uh as they did they were people who were not acquainted with our language in our ways but they were fine laundrymen and uh they couldn't write the ticket so you could get your right laundry back but the he got himself a bunch of little cards with nothing on it at all so when you come for your laundry he would take this card and tear it in a certain way and hand you one piece and he kept the other piece and now it's a little better than what we have now because when you come back to claim what was your own those two pieces must Dove tail you couldn't impersonate it if you had to there's no way of do you can make copies of letters but you can't impersonate that tear it's got to fit exactly with the other piece Therefore your dirty clothes that you brought in you could redeem them by this ticket because it match the ticket that was turned in and when God by the prophets that under the law condemned us to sin and the law has no Grace it's only tells you you are a sinner but when Jesus came on the scene he was the Fulfillment he was the the Fulfillment of everything God had promised he was a perfect identical image of the promise amen therefore all Promises of the Old Testament was met in Jesus Christ it couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be met in any of the prophets but it was met in the masterp it matched all that it said it was going to be so will the church have to be a match to everything God has promised amen amen must be that piece is smitten off of it so if the original is the word so will the subjects that's been taken from it be the word word to match its side therefore the chiman you could claim where the law condem you said you were dirty and you were guilty and could put you in the prison but when he came he was the match piece for it that could take you out and bring you back too to be the complete ticket the Redemption that God had promised back in the Garden of Eden thy seed shall bruise the Serpent's head but his uh heel shall bruise uh bruise its head now we find this perfect Masterpiece that God had completed now we notice that he was all that it was promised to be he's all the promises all the prophecies everything that God had made a promise of thy seed shall bruise the Serpent's head now he could not bruise it with the law he could not bruise it with the prophets but he did do it when the woman's seed became the Masterpiece Christ he was a stone that Daniel saw HW out of the mountain he was the one could Smite he's the one that could bruise bruise the Serpent's head his life matched exactly the life of Moses his life matched David let's see if it was if he's the matching piece notice David a rejected King over his own people he was one day while he was his own son rose up in Mutiny against him and he separated and divided the armies of Israel and he was David was drove are driven by his own people from his throne and on he rolled out there was a man who hated him and he's walking along there spitting on David that guard pulled his sword said I let that dog's head stay on him spit on my King David said let him alone God told him to do it don't you see a man of sorrow acquainted with grief he stands like a sheep before shears dumb he said that perhaps David didn't know what he was saying but about 5 600 years afterwards or a little more the son of David was going through them same streets amen and he was spit upon but notice what happened when David Al out of his when he became a fugitive and out of his Exile when he when he came back that man begged for peace Mercy even those who smote him will see him one day when he returns and we find out then in Joseph and Joseph was a peculiar born boy the last top part of the foundation where the Masterpiece was to be built upon it come from faith and to love and to Grace it come to Perfection and so did it from the feet of the beginning come forth unto perfection in Christ notice how that he was portrayed in Joseph the top of the foundation the most perfect of all of them we find that Joseph was born to his family and he was by the legal woman actually which was um Jacob's wife and notice also that when he was born his father loved him and his brothers hated him without a cause why did they hate him because he was the word amen see the very Foundation see how the head of the Foundation come look at the head of the body comes I watch the head of the Bride come he was the word and they hated him because he was a sear he fores saw things and told him they happened no matter how long it lered it happened just the same and by being spiritual he was excommunicated from his Brethren they ought to have loved him but they hated him because he was a prophet he was spiritual and they hated him notice he was sold for almost 30 pieces of silver thrown it into a ditch and supposedly be dead but was tuck up from the ditch and in his time of Temptation the prison the Butler and the the baker we know that the butler was saved and the baker was lost and in Christ's prison house on the cross one was saved and the other was lost lost two thieves two wrongdoers and we notice he was taken from his prison to the right hand of pharaoh that no man could speak to Pharaoh only through Joseph and when Joseph left that Throne of pharaoh the trumpet sounded throughout Egypt the blast went forth and said bow that he everybody Joseph is coming forth so will it be with Jesus how he was loved of the father and hated of them denominational Breen Without a Cause he was sold for 30 pieces of silver as it was and put into the ditch supposedly to be dead on the cross one lost the other and saved and was lifted up from the cross and sits at the right hand of God in the Majesty the great spirit which have been reflected in him and no man can speak to God only through Jesus Christ think of it and when he leaves that Throne starts forth a trumpet will sound and every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess oh amen remember he was a son of prosperity everything that he did prospered whereever his prisoner wherever it was it come out right and as he promised for his children and make everything work together for the good what it was sickness prison house death Sorrows whatever it was they would work for the good to them that loved him hall hallelujah he promised it it must be so it's got to be there it's figured he spoke to us in him he was that perfect image of God now we see here also that when he comes again remember Joseph by Revelation save the world by his great prophecy the world would have died if it hadn't been for Joseph and the world would would been dead if it hadn't been for Jesus for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish God is reserving life on and on we could go because he was simply the match of David he was was a match of Moses he was the match of Elijah he was a match of Joseph everything is a pitor for told by in the Old Testament matched right into that what is it showing a perfect Redeemer that we can put old dirty clo to the laundry go claim it again it's been washed in the blood of the Lamb prise the Lord hallelujah we can claim what's our own and everything thing that he died for we can claim it so he was a perfect word portrayed it pleased God the great sculpture to Smite him and to do it this way we see him in Isaiah here is read we all did a Ste him we turned our face from him there's no beauty that we should desire him everybody talking about make fun of him I'm talking about him now in this day everybody making fun of him see we did esteem him we saw him esteem means to look at we did Este him smitten Afflicted of God yet he what did he do this far he was wounded for our transgressions amen he was bruised for our iniquity now we could go on and on with that but I believe you have the picture of what I mean now God building back his Masterpiece but let us not forget that in the beginning when he smoke the side of Adam he took something from his side now the smiting of Christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride you might take him a bride so when his Masterpiece was perfected then he had to Smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but all the same creation my brother don't think bad of this but think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he never made another creation he took a part of the original creation then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word Living God in the word Kimberly South Africa once I was looking at diamonds how they was brought up out of the ground and I seen him laying there as well the the superintendent of the plant or the mine was one of my ushers in the prayer line and uh I noticed the diamonds valued of tens of thousands of dollars piled together but they didn't Sparkle even under the light and I said to the superintendent of the minds I said why don't they sparkle he said sir they haven't been cut yet they must be cut then when they are cut then they reflect the light there you are the Masterpiece must be cut notice cut for what is the piece cut off no no the piece is cut off is made of vrola needle and the vcta needle is put upon a a a record that's unseen music to the world but the needle is what brings it out brings out the true interpretation of the word his life met to all the peoples it pleased God to Smite him and now why did he Smite him for the same cause he had to Smite Adam now we see him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted the perfect lamb for SL siners slain a perfect Masterpiece now for nearly 2,000 years God has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck at him to get a a piece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and old is husband and wife and it taking the new to for the old to fores show the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bribe will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another masterpieces in making as it taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride far Christ another Masterpiece and so doing it he he does it by his never changing method the same way he made the Masterpiece amen his word that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's a perfect word any dirt trash injections it'll break but the heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never break remember cutting a diamond you have to have a perfect tool to do it with not just any piece will do it I've seen tons of them big Grinders crash right through it and move them big tons over pass that diamond right on through no you don't break the diamond has to be cut now he's doing the same thing and his never changing method we find out Mali 3 he said I'm God and I change not he cannot change his method now as he started in Abraham after the follow of the first Masterpiece he started in Abraham on the foundation to build another Masterpiece he started on the day of Pentecost to build another Masterpiece The Original Seed word start in the first church what was it the seed word the word manifested the promise that had been given Joel said it shall come to pass the night day sayith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old old man shall dream dreams your young man shall see Visions what he would do in the last days two last 2,000 years notice and it started out as the original as Jesus said the word of God is a seed that is sore sold and he was the soar the seed was the word and notice any seed that abides alone never does nothing it's got to fall into the ground to bring forth its production again and this seed that perfect Church fell to the ground at nasia Rome when she become a denomination now historians remember and you going to hear this tape check it up and find out that's not right the church died at n seea Rome when she took dogmas and creeds instead of the original word what was it God had showed by that first church that he was God Amen he had a church perfected but the church like all other seeds must fall into the ground and die now it fell into the ground and die and wasted away you know I read a book here not long ago someone wrote a a book and said the silent God you might have read it I forget I I think brck no I don't I'm not sure who it was wrot it but I can't remember I got it in my study the silent God said God to Thousand Years of Dark Ages set still and never moved a hand and watch faithful Martyrs go to the Lion's pit and be burn by the Romans assassination of all kinds women stripped of their clothes Set Fire to the long hair with tar and burn him remember short hair first began in Rome and the women of Christians had long hair so they they dipped it in tar and set them a fire and burned them and then naked V him to the lines and this right goes to say where is that God oh the blindness of man sometimes do you not know that that seed had to die he never tried to deliver lamb they went down in Victory they went down bleeding and dying giving their lives why it was a seed that had to fall into the ground first John 12 tells us the corn of wheat it's got the fall into the ground and there die not only die but rot but little did that denomination know that that lifee was still in there oh the church in itself that n i see a council of 15 days of bloody politician debate when them Aristocrats come in and want to inject these big dignitaries into the church and Prophets come out of that Wilderness there eating herbs and wrapped in animal skins Janu and Prophets and they throw them out why the seeds got to fall into the ground it's got to die it died in the Dark Ages down beneath the dark dirt they thought it was gone you know St John 12:24 Jesus said except the corn of wheat falls into the ground it abides alone and the first church was that reproduction that bride that seed that word made manifest that fell into the ground and now I see a Rome listen Church throughout the Nations that'll hear this there is your dirt as them denominations there's where the word was crucified and they accepted dogma and for hundreds and hundreds of years of Dark Ages the power and manifestation of the word was hid from the world only Catholicism ruled we all know that as reading history only Catholicism rule but you you can't hide a gerti seed it's got the to come forth because why the great sculpture is on the jobah go to build again so he the seed went down the word why we see St Paul Peter James John all those who wrote the word in the road they were they wrot become alive and lived and it live lived and when we find after it be to get ripe John began to write in Epistles he was St on the aisle of patmas after being burnt in a for 24 hours but the word must come forth has got to be wrote they couldn't borrow the holy ghost out of him with all so he come forth his work wasn't finished he died in not natural death polycarp which was a disciple of John carried the word on and from pcarp came irenius and irenius the great uh man of God who believe the very same gospel that we believe the word is right the church trying to squeeze it out finally come to Nar Rome and there she fell into the ground after St Martin and was murdered St Martin beli the same thing we believe he stood the same thing the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism and water in Jesus name he stood in the very same thing that we do and he was a prophet amen Believe the full word of God and finally they were crucified and mashed into the ground and laid there for hundreds of years and till it rotted the outside seed the old bodies just rotted away I've been in San Angelo in the catacombs and see where they died and there broken bones and everything they finally Ro until their bones were gone but the life was still there the corn of wheat that fell into the ground on at the Nia Council begin to sprout again in Martin Luther like any corn coming up or wheat at the seed's Rock the life Springs forth and it begin to bring forth in Martin Luther what did he do the first thing reject the denomination of Catholicism right protested that it was wrong where he said the just shall live by faith what was it a little weak life it put up a couple little shoots that was a Luther's it sure don't look like the green that went in the ground but the life is coming out now then it went on to a stock then what happened in the days of John Wesley what did he do when he brought out sanctification he stayed with the word and what did he do the Lutheran had organized and made an organization so it was time for something to happen amen the Masterpiece is being built now what did he do what did he do he protested that angle in church came out in the Reformation as a tossel what is it the seeds coming to life growing now now the stock doesn't look like the seed neither does the tossle now Pentecostal Brethren throughout the Nations I want you to listen my brother if this is the last message I'll ever preach this is my masterpiece do you notice when the Wheats the corn of wheat that falls into the ground when it begins to farm back to its its grain again what's nature nature exactly is God God working in nature it's all it can but from the Pentecostal Revival as they think was the seed it wasn't now watch but something come forth just like the seed watch what Jesus said in St Matthew 24:24 that the two Spirits at the last days would be so close together it would deceive the elected if possible now that stalk don't look nothing like a seed neither does a tossel look like a seed but notice now not in Luther's day but in the last day the first thing there's wheat Farmers studing here the first thing that comes forth on a wheat seed you would almost think it was a seed but what is it it's the husk it forms a little outside thing like to hold the seed it forms a husk but the husk is not the seed no more than the tosser of the stalk was it's only a carrier of the life the corn of wheat then of St John 12 you see Jesus speaking the wheat after the tossel after uh Wesley puts forth the husk which is the foremost like the grain of anything else the husk is more like the green it's coming more like the green all the time the one that went in the ground and when it comes forth the stock it's got life in it but it sure isn't the green comes forth the tossel the pollen it still isn't the green and then it comes forth the husk and it's just in the shape of the wheat just exactly like the grain of wheat but yet it isn't the wheat just exactly in the same shape perfectly the Pentecost has come out just like the wheat would each one comes out from the other coming out from the other but they're only a carrier they go to denomination and that's what Pentecost did went to the denomination and what did Pentecost will do when it come out just like the grain it went right back like in Revelation 17 to1 one of the sister denominations that's exactly what that's what Jesus said now what the gospel is going to come out through Luther through Wesley into the Pentecost and at the last days they'll see the very elected if it's possible the elected oh Pentecostal Brethren can't you see the wheat in its first beginning is just like the seed when it begins to form like the seed but it's a husk it denominated exactly done the same thing that did down here in Luther Revelation 17 it proves the same thing other churches now the Green Seed in the original fell at Nia for it was the first denomination notice here the life that was in the stalk tossled all now ends up in the the seed the life that come out of the original seed come up through different processes three different processes and then turns back till its original condition hallelujah oh my the happiest person in the world that God is let me see this watch how perfect the word and these works together just like we Pro the resurrection rise the sun setting and the sun rising again the leaf going out of the tree down in the sap into the root and comes back up and and the leaf comes back up with it again it falls on the ground the life of the tree sucks it right back to calcium and poish and brings right up to another Leaf again see all nature everything works right with with the word of God and here it is exactly perfectly in these Church ages that's the reason the Holy Ghost came down and draw those things and made them out farest way he has amen it's exactly no is share the life that was in the husk in the stalk and in the tossel in the husk all gathers in the seat and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself amen that was good I so enjoy you know we all listen to the messages we all spend time in the word but it's really special to listen together I love to hear your amens amen amen it makes the amen pop out of me more and more so I get excited let's go go if we can pull up our questions all right first question why did God change why did God change to an unconditional Covenant let's go to paragraph 57 at the top of page 12 says now we find that the anti anti deluvian world came along and destroyed the whole thing because the Covenant that was made was made conditionally if you will not do this or if you will do that God the great sculptor seeing that man could not could not keep a covenant he just can't do it there's just no way at all how many can say amen that's what Paul said amen Paul said though I would do good evil is present with me why because man was sold into sin in the garden and he come into a hybrid condition and now man cannot keep the word perfectly in and of himself so he could not keep a covenant on the interview a few moments ago this is where he speaks about sister Bruce I speak speaking to a person in the room that's present now said but brother bham I have so many things that I know that's wrong and a Godly little woman I said but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you try to do if you really love the Lord you try to serve him with all your heart then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of Jesus see he made a way so he began now taking man from his covenants of saying that if you will I will and he began with the man called Abraham and give to Abraham a covenant and unconditionally every time he would start a masterpiece Satan would get it because the word but when he started with Abraham he said I have already done it now this is unconditionally now that if you will not that if you will I will but I've already done it now he the sculptor is determined to have his Masterpiece why is he doing this because he's determined to have the Masterpiece because it was the image he had in his mind and the desire he wanted to express of himself and he's not going to let anything even our hybrid condition stop that plan so he had to come with an unconditional Covenant so he wouldn't say CU if he would have said if you'll do this I'll do that then God could have never fulfilled his masterp because man can't keep the word of God Only God himself can keep his word amen uh paragraph 16 now then from Abraham came the Patriarchs now what's God doing he's rebuilding this masterpiece that had fallen so in the Patriarchs the first we find was Abraham let's go to paragraph 118 from here let's jump over to page 23 page 23 paragraph 118 it says but you can't hide a germatize seed it's got to come forth because why the great the great sculptor is on the job he's going to build again why but we go back over here to paragraph 59 on page 12 at the bottom said but I've already done it he the sculpter is determined to have his Masterpiece so that's what he did he put the life in the seed and he planted the seed because he knows that that life will come forth why cuz it's got life in it why cuz he's determined to have his Masterpiece I'm so thankful that God's determined aren't you thankful he wasn't leaving it based on our determination because we were set up to fail by the fall and none of us could do it amen Jesus Christ was the only one without a scratch praise God all right let's look at our second question what is the foundation of the Masterpiece let's go to paragraph 61 here on page 12 now watch every Masterpiece is put on a foundation a sculpture Angelo's Monument of Moses is on a three or 4ft piece of marble it's got a foundation so God in preparing this masterpiece he put it on a foundation of the Patriarchs and the patriarch Foundation First was Abraham then Isaac then Jacob then Joseph the four corners and now Abraham was the foundation of Faith let's say he had four foundations the foundation of Faith was Abraham the foundation of love was Isaac the foundation of Grace was Jacob God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that but in Joseph was Perfection there is where he could set the there is where he could set the monument upon not the First Foundation the second Foundation the third Foundation but on the fourth Foundation praise God I I want you to hold that in your mind he had to set it on the fourth Foundation let's go to uh read this next paragraph Abraham portrayed Christ of course so did Isaac in love Abraham did in faith Isaac did in love Jacob did by his grace because Jacob means deceiver and that's what he was but God's grace was with him but then it came to Joseph there was nothing against him just one little scratch for the foundation must also be a masterpiece so I thought that was amazing that he couldn't set it on the first or the second or the third but he's going to set it on the fourth Foundation which was Perfection but when it comes to Joseph he tipes Perfection and he had no flaw except one little scratch for the for the foundation must also reflect the Masterpiece he needed that scratch and he needed it for more than one reason because he had to reflect the Masterpiece but also he couldn't have a perfect man yet because only Jesus Christ could be the perfect man so he had to have that little scratch amen but yet he typed perfection praise God let's look now at our next question question what makes up uh the body of the Masterpiece so what is the foundation the Patriarchs what is the body let's look at paragraph 66 now the bodyw work that come onto this Great Masterpiece was the prophets which was the word I hope you can read it see the prophets not the laws the prophets for the prophets was the Vindicated Words which makes the body not the Patriarchs the prophets they they were the word finally as he started way back in the days of Moses and come down through the prophets to each one and finally building up the body coming closer all the time and the greatest of all of them was John the Bible said so Jesus said it there's not a man ever born of a woman as great as John the Baptist for he was the one that could introduce the word what was he foreshadowing he was foreshadowing the Elijah of our day amen the greatest of the church age Messengers John was the greatest prophet of all why cuz he was going to introduce the word brother Brandon was the greatest of the church age Messengers why because the same exact reason that John was the greatest of the prophets because he was going to introduce the word praise God so the prophets made up the body I think it's interesting that he said the prophets made up the body because we know this is an image of the word he said not the laws but the prophets he said because the prophets were the Vindicated word they were the Living Word they were they were betraying a great prophet that was coming they were fleshing out the word not just what was written down but what was living showing this is the body of the image it's the Living Word the word living in flesh that made up the body now what makes up the head paragraph 68 and then came finally the great head the head of it all the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it of all of it Jesus come on the scene there when his headpiece was put upon it we find in him the entire handiwork of God we find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word the fullness of the word now again God has the perfect Masterpiece and is as as Isaiah said behold my servant my masterpiece and I portrayed through all the ages of this perfect one coming and here he stands right before me a per a perfect there in his own image reflecting God for he said in John 14 when you see me you see the father and then in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was hewed out and reflected what the word was at the beginning him the word reflected in the Masterpiece in his own likeness God back again in his own likeness the word form being reflected in the image of man the Masterpiece so you could call this the capping of the monument the head coming down the capping off the full word in Perfection to cap off the Masterpiece and to complete the Masterpiece let's go to paragraph 70 on page 14 all the prophets had flaws all the ones was a portion but here at the last coming up through that finally comes the Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in his work God and Christ were one in so much until he put his own Spirit into him and then even the image and the Builder became one God and His sculpture work his Masterpiece there where Moses was in the work of St Angelo or Michelangelo rather was a sculpture work that was dead because it had been made of made of stone but here the master builder when he got his handiwork perfected he stepped into it oh I love that let's go to paragraph 78 at the bottom of the next page God when he looked upon him he was so inspired to see him the way he looked to see the form of him he was so inspired that it would be the perfect Masterpiece of a redeemer Jesus the Redeemer so God in order to be smitten himself because to pay his own penalty God and Christ became one so God could be smoked in the image he could be scarred praise God that and that's what Isaiah said we did esteem him is smitten and Afflicted God yet he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed praise God that was the headship coming to this body the completion of the Masterpiece and God stepped into it so that he could be smitten for us it's beautiful next question what does the Old and New Testament represent let's go over to um paragraph 85 on page 17 and when God by the prophets and under the law condemned us to sin and the law was has no Grace it only tells you you're a sinner but when Jesus came on the scene he was the Fulfillment he was the Fulfillment of everything God promised he was the perfect identical image of the promise therefore all Promises of the Old Testament was met in Jesus Christ it couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be met in any of prophets but it was met in the Masterpiece and I'm it matched all that it said it was going to be praise God let's read the next part so will the church have to be a match to everything God has promised it must be the peace that's smitten off of it so if the original is the word so will the subjects have been taken from it be the word to match its side we'll come back to that again later now let's go over to paragraph 108 on page 21 page 21 paragraph 108 now for nearly 2,000 years God has been making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam a piece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled see the New and Old Testament is husband and wife and it takes the new the old to for fores show the new Christ came the Masterpiece to fulf fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece in the making and it taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece and so doing it he does it by his never changing method the same way he made the Masterpiece his word that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's the perfect word what is the old New Testament husband and wife Christ and his bride he come down the capping off to fulfill all the Old Testament for 4,000 years he built back Adam that had fallen the Son of God now he was the last Adam he was the perfect Masterpiece and so he did the same thing he did to Adam he smoted him and took a piece for a bride and for 2,000 years he's been building back a masterpiece of a bride and now in the end time the Capstone is coming back to this bride which is what the same headship that capped the first one is capping the next one it is Christ himself the word coming down to make her a perfect reflection of the piece that was smoken off now she's to fulfill he fulfilled the Old Testament she's to fulfill everything that was written in the New Testament and she's not Jesus fleshed it out and lived it we're here to flesh it out and live it amen and amen and amen how are we going to do it cuz the headships come down the same one who lived the word is the same one here living the word it's not us ourselves but it's the headship of Christ has come down and the life of that word is coming to us to manifest itself amen now the the last question what does the three stages of of of wheat development produce we all know this but I just love going through it again let's look at paragraph 122 he types it with the church ages and the paragraph 122 at the bottom of page 23 the corn of wheat that fell into the ground at Nia Council began to sprout again in Martin Luther like any corn coming up or wheat after the seeds rough the life Springs forth and he began to bring forth in Martin Luther what did he do the first thing uh reject the denomination of Catholicism protest that it was wrong for he said the just shall live by faith what was it a little weak life that put up a couple little shoots that was the Luthers it sure don't look like the grain that went in the ground but the life is coming up now then it went on to stalk then what happened in the days of John Wesley what did he do when he brought out sanctification he stayed with the word and what did it do the lutherans had organized and made an organization so it was time for something to happen the Masterpiece is being built now what did he do what uh what did he do he protested the Anglican Church came out in the Reformation as a tassel what what is it the seed is coming to life growing now now the stalk doesn't look like the seed neither does the tassel let's go down paragraph 127 now that stalk don't look nothing like a seed neither does the tassel look like a seed but notice now not in Luther's day but in the last day the first thing there is a wheat farmer sitting here the first thing that comes forth on a wheat seed you would almost think it was a seed what is it it's the husk it forms a little outside thing like to hold the seed it forms a husk but the hus husk is not the seed no more than the tassel of the stalk was it's only a carrier of the life the corner wheat then St John 12 you see Jesus speaking the wheat after the tassel after the Wesley puts forth the husk which is the foremost like the grain of anything else the husk is more like the grain it's coming more like the grain all the time the one that went in the ground and when it comes forth the stalk it's got life in it but it sure isn't the grain it comes forth the tossel the pollen it still isn't the Grain and when then it comes forth the husk and it's just in the shape of the wheat just exactly like the grain and wheat but yet it isn't the wheat just exactly in the same shape perfectly let's go down to paragraph 134 notice here the life was in the stalk tossel all now ends up in the seed the life that come out of the original seed come up through the different processes three different processes and then turns back to its original condition here's where we really get down to our answer what does the three stages of wheat development produce it brings it back to its original condition what was Luther Wesley and Pentecost supposed to do bring it back to its original condition what's the original condition Pentecost amen what happened in the first at the first when the Holy Ghost first fell is to bring us back into the original condition amen come up through the different processes three different processes and then turns back to its original condition he goes now he says oh I'm the happiest person in the world that God has let me see watch how perfectly the word in these nature works together why is brother Benham so happy to see this because the church ages has been so confusing amen the Pentecostal Revival has been so confusing but now he's the happiest person in the world that God has cut away all the confusion and explained what it's all been about because brother brandom couldn't say Luther wasn't a real Christian he couldn't say Wesley wasn't he couldn't say the isusa Street Revival wasn't a real Revival and they weren't real Christians but then it goes and then it goes to denom ation then it then it refuses to move on with the word and it's so confusing until God comes back and types it with nature and say no I will restore sayeth the Lord I'm it's a restoration process that seed amen that fell on the day of Pentecost had to go into the ground at NAA and die and then come back through three stages of growth to do what to bring it back to its original condition again that is what the church ages have been about now let's read paragraph 136 notice here the life that was in the husk in the stalk in the tossle in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make another justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manif EST itself what is this bride supposed to be she has to come back to Perfection you say brother Chad that's impossible look in the mirror listen I know In the Flesh humanly that's impossible but he's washed her with he's washing her with a perfect word to bring forth A Perfect Bride what's The Perfect Bride I I I I don't know what it will be like at the moment before the translation of the body I can't tell you I can't say that it'll be perfectly Flawless but what I believe a Perfect Bride will be is a bride perfectly submitted to the headship of the word that's what I believe and that's what God is washing all the denominations and all our idea by the washing of the water of the bleeding word he's washing everything away and bringing a bride into Perfection who will just stay with his word that's I think what he calls A Perfect Bride that's what we're coming to friends am amen I just want to make just a couple other quick little points let's go to paragraph 84 before we do that I think it's interesting that brother Venom says this process of three brought us back to the grain back to the original and then he says it wasn't the first second or third Foundation that the it could be said it could only be set on the fourth Foundation cuz the fourth Foundation amen was Perfection was Joseph and now the first three stages of the wheat plant the restoration of the brid tree he couldn't set that headship down on any of those it couldn't come until it come back to the fourth back to the grain itself so we've had to come through Luther Wesley and the Pentecostal Revival and we had to go beyond that because it's got to come back into its original condition the fourth amen the fourth stage back to the original and that's what's transpiring right now praise God all right let's look at paragraph 84 I'm not going to read 84 but we're I'm pointing to it to show this is where he begins talking about the China laundrymen the China men and the Chinese ticket the ticket that was torn the two pieces have to come back and match and it's so interesting the way brother bandam uses this if we go down to the uh paragraph 85 let's go to the second paragraph under 85 so will the church have to be a match to everything God has promised it must be the piece that was smitten off of it so if the original is the word so will the subjects been taken from it be the word to match its side so the bride what does the bride have to do for these two pieces of the laundry man's ticket to come back together what's the first piece the first piece is the Old Testament it's the word off of that came the new testament which is the word one is the bridegroom one is the bride and these two must fit back together again that's why there's been a restoration of the word because nothing else will fit but a perfect reflection of the New Testament amen when Paul told us how to dress we've got to dress that way when Paul told us not forsake the assembly we can't forsake the assembly amen when when when Peter told us to baptize in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we must baptize it's not just going through motions it's a actually a restoration back to the word because only the word will fit back into the side of this masterpiece so he's got to wash he's got to bring us through the stage he got to bring us back to the original to believe what the apostles and Prophets and the disciples had written in the word so that it can be fleshed out and manifest what is she the New Testament that's all she's everything that was written in the New Testament if they laid hands on and prayed for we lay hands on and prayed for if they Anointed with oil we anoint with oil if they believe for healing We Believe for healing if they had gifts we have gifts why it's got to be the full reflection of the word to connect back amen what for for Redemption to bring it back to Eden praise God that's what this message is doing for us amen it's bringing us back into that amen word image Amen Let me see all right yeah let's go to paragraph 101 on page 20 101 but let us not forget that in the beginning when he smoked the side of Adam he took something from his side now the smiting of Christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride he might take him a bride so his Masterpiece was perfected then he had to Smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but of the same creation my brother don't think bad at this but think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he never made another creation he took a part of of the original creation then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word Living God in the word the word has got to connect back to the word why because it what was smitten off was the word then let's go to paragraph 105 because I think brother Benham he'll take an analogy and he just keeps breaking it down and using it in so many different ways he said Jesus Christ was the other half of the laundry ticket to the word to the promises so he when he fulfilled all the promises then he come to complete the word and the promises and when that connected back together that unlocked Redemption for you and I then he showed that out of him came the bride and now when they come back together when those two half it's the completion of redemption to go back to Eden so he just keeps break he keeps working an analogy over and over so you don't stop and you're thinking it's only this amen he keeps using it but then he's going to take this analogy now of the diamond and The Cutting of a diamond because the diamond doesn't shine light until it cuts and he's going to show that we have to be cut by what by the word because only the right kind of tool can cut the diamond and so it reflects the light but then he's also going to use Christ the word is the diamond and the piece cut off what's the purpose of that and I thought this was interesting 105 the Masterpiece must be cut cut for what it's the piece cut off no the piece that's cut off is made of victrola needle now hold on stop here there's young people amongst us I got to stop for just a minute you may have been in a museum sometime and seen a vinyl record and they used to take this plastic vinyl record and they cut grooves in it and you'd put a little on a little plate and that plate had a motor and it would Spin and you would take a little needle and put a needle down and as that needle moved on those grooves it reproduced sound out of a speaker that's how we actually used to have music and stuff a long time ago I know it's blowing your mind now but we didn't have anything digital right but that little needle and originally they would use a piece of diamond on that that little victrola needle now listen to what he said that piece that's cut off it's made of victrola needle and the victrola needle is put upon a record that's unseen music to the world but the needle is what brings it out brings out the truth true interpretation of the word do you believe you're a piece that's smitten off the great Diamond then what are we supposed to be doing we're supposed to be following the rhythm of the word and reproducing the word in manifestation amen this is the word this is the record that that has the grooves cut in it and nobody can read that and understand what it is you can look at all the grooves on a vinyl record and you can't make the music it's going to take the needle to replicate the sound amen and that's what all the pieces that are smitten off of that great Diamond we're here to be those needles that reproduce the what the true interpretation of the word what does it mean to be a church what does it mean to be modest what does it mean to be holy what does it mean to submit to the headship of the word what does it mean that's what we're here to play that record praise God oh I love that I love how how brother B could just keep working in analogy amen praise be to God all right we might be done oh paragraph 96 on page 19 I don't want to leave without making note of this this blessed me so much paragraph 96 on page 19 remember he was the son of prosperity everything he did prospered whether it was prison or whether it was it came outright and hasn't he promised for his children that he'd make everything work together for the good whether it was sickness prison house death sorrow whatever it was that it would work for the good to them that loved him he promised it and it must be so it's got to be there it's figurative spoke to us in him he was the perfect image of God he's taking the type of Joseph Joseph is the perfect reflection of Jesus Christ Joseph was a Prophet Joseph was loved of his father hated of his brothers sold into slavery in the prison house and one was saved the Baker and one was lost the baker the butler however it was then he ascended on high to the right hand of the throne no one could go to Pharaoh but by him and he's using that analogy in showing now Jesus Christ is the son of prosperity everywhere Joseph went it prospered in the prison house it prospered in slavery it prospered in his family it prospered at the right hand of the throne it prospered but now he's our son of prosperity and now because we're his children we get the same benefit of the Perfection of the of the child of prosperity and he's promised for us everything will work out just like it did for Joseph just like it did for Jesus no matter where we wind up no matter what trial we're going through we are married connected children of God and part of the son of prosperity cuz why his word can't fail he's determined to have a masterpiece we go through things yes we go through things and sometimes it gets scary sometimes it gets dark but don't forget who we're connected to God is so good praise God let's all stand musicians if you please come God is so good I love that part where brother Benham was talking about this nation no nation's gone years we won't go back and read it but you remember said this nation's only got 11 years left he said will it stand no he didn't see any way it was going to make it we've crossed 250 years but I love what he said it's got to fall every nation has got to fall every Kingdom's got to fall to make room for the kingdom that's not going to fall and we're watching it fall we're W it's right before our eyes this nation this kingdom is falling but Prophet said it has to fall to make room for his kingdom every other Kingdom has the fall when we see it falling listen if you get too patriotic you're going to be too heartbroken and it's a shame and it's a sad thing but every Kingdom has to fall why to make room for his kingdom the collapse of America is making room for the King of Kings to come and Rule and reign and that will not break our hearts that's what our hearts are longing for amen I love you all it's so fun to go through these messages together I love it amen let's sing give a song
