[0:00] Well, I'm thinking of a rapture in that
[0:03] blessed home on high when the
[0:07] redeemed are gathering
[0:10] in. How raise the heavenly anthem in
[0:14] that city in the sky. When the
[0:18] redeemed are gathering
[0:20] in. Oh, when the
[0:23] redeemed are gathering
[0:26] in, washed like
[0:29] snow and free from all
[0:32] sin. How we'll
[0:34] shout and how we'll
[0:37] sing and the
[0:40] redeemed are gathering
[0:42] in. And there will be a great procession
[0:46] over on the streets of gold when the
[0:51] regime are gathering
[0:53] in. Oh, what music? Oh, what singing or
[0:57] the city will be rolled in when the
[1:01] redeemed are gathering
[1:04] in. Oh, and the
[1:07] redeemed are gathering
[1:09] in. Hearts like
[1:12] snow and free from all
[1:15] sin. How we'll
[1:17] shout and how we'll
[1:20] sing and
[1:22] redeem our gathering
[1:25] in. And saints will sing redemption
[1:28] story with their voices clear and
[1:31] strong. When the
[1:33] redeemed are gathering
[1:36] in, then the angels all will listen. For
[1:40] they cannot join that song. When the
[1:44] redeemed are gathering
[1:46] in, oh when the
[1:49] redeemed are gathering
[1:52] in, wash like
[1:54] snow and free from all sin.
[1:58] How we'll
[2:00] shout, how we'll
[2:03] sing, and the
[2:05] redeemed are gathering
[2:07] in. Well, then the Savior will give
[2:11] orders to prepare the banquet
[2:14] for when the redeemed are gathering
[2:18] in. And we'll hear his invitation. Come
[2:22] ye blessed of the Lord.
[2:26] Wo when the redeemed are gathering
[2:29] in. When the
[2:34] redeemed washed like
[2:37] so and free from all
[2:39] sin. I will
[2:42] shout. I will sing.
[2:46] and the
[2:47] redeemed are gathering
[2:50] in. Well, my heavenly home is bright and
[2:56] fair. I feel like traveling
[3:01] on. No pain nor death can enter there. I
[3:07] feel like traveling on.
[3:12] Yes, I feel like traveling
[3:16] on. I feel like traveling
[3:21] on. Oh, my heavenly home is bright and
[3:26] fair. And I feel like traveling
[3:31] on. It's glittering towers. The sun
[3:36] outshine.
[3:38] I feel like traveling
[3:42] on. That heavenly mansion shall be mine.
[3:48] I feel like traveling
[3:52] on. I feel like traveling
[3:57] on. I feel like traveling on.
[4:03] My heavenly home is bright and bare. I
[4:08] feel like traveling
[4:12] on. Let others seek the home below. I
[4:18] feel like traveling
[4:22] on which flames
[4:25] devour waves or flow. I feel like
[4:30] traveling. Verse four.
[4:33] Well, the Lord has been so good to me. I
[4:38] feel like traveling
[4:42] on until that blessed home I see. I feel
[4:49] like traveling
[4:51] on. Oh yes, I feel like traveling,
[4:56] traveling on. I feel like traveling
[5:02] on. My heavenly home is bright and fair.
[5:08] I feel like traveling
[5:12] home. I'm a pilgrim and a
[5:17] stranger wondering through this world of
[5:21] sin.
[5:23] I'm on my way to that fair
[5:27] city. When the saints go maring
[5:32] in. When the
[5:34] saints go marching
[5:37] in. When the saints go maring
[5:42] in. Oh Lord, I want to be in that
[5:46] number.
[5:48] When the saints go marching
[5:52] in, oh, I know I'll see my
[5:57] Savior. If my life is free from
[6:02] sin, heaven's doors will open for me.
[6:08] When the saints go marching
[6:12] in. When the
[6:14] saints go marching
[6:17] in. When the saints go maring
[6:21] in. Oh Lord, I want to be in that
[6:27] number. When the saints go maring
[6:31] in. And when we gather around the
[6:36] throne and the gates are closed
[6:41] within, I'll be shouting glory, glory.
[6:47] When the saints go maring
[6:51] in. Oh, when the
[6:53] saints go marching
[6:56] in. When the saints go maring in. Lord,
[7:02] I know I'll be in that
[7:06] number. When the saints go maring in one
[7:11] more time. When the
[7:13] saints go marching in.
[7:17] When the saints go maring
[7:21] in, Lord, I know I'll be in that
[7:26] number. When the saints go
[7:31] maring, I'll say yes, Lord, yes to your
[7:38] will and to your way.
[7:42] I'll say yes, Lord.
[7:46] Yes, I will trust you and
[7:50] obey. When your spirit speaks to
[7:55] me with my whole heart, I'll
[8:00] agree. And my answer will be yes, Lord.
[8:07] Yes. Once more.
[8:10] Will I'll say yes, Lord. Yes to your
[8:16] will and to your
[8:19] way. I'll say yes, Lord. Yes. I will
[8:25] trust you and
[8:28] obey when your spirit speaks to me.
[8:33] With my whole heart I'll
[8:37] agree and my answer will be
[8:42] yes
[8:46] Lord. I just want to thank you
[8:51] Lord for letting me hear your word.
[8:57] What have I done to deserve such glory
[9:02] revealed in
[9:05] me? Thanks for that special
[9:10] night when I saw your glorious life.
[9:16] Came face to face with eternal life.
[9:21] Lord, I thank
[9:25] thee and I just want to thank you,
[9:30] Lord, for letting me hear your
[9:35] word. What have I done to deserve such
[9:40] glory revealed in me?

[14:11] praise
[14:14] you as brother Chad comes. Oh, how I
[14:18] long to
[14:20] be in love with you till all the world
[14:26] just
[14:27] fades
[14:29] from me. A deep calling to the
[14:34] deep. Burning
[14:37] inside is my heart's
[14:43] crown. To have the word
[14:48] made in
[14:50] me, living pure and
[14:53] holy unto thee. This longing in my
[14:59] heart only you can
[15:09] satisfy. How I long to be in love with
[15:15] you till all the world just
[15:18] fades
[15:20] from you. Deep falling to the
[15:25] deep, burning in sun is my heart's
[15:34] come. To have the word made
[15:38] manifest in
[15:40] me, living pure and
[15:43] holy
[15:45] unto thee. this longing in my
[15:50] heart. Only you can
[15:58] satisfy. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[16:01] together this evening. Dear heavenly
[16:04] father, we thank you Lord once again for
[16:07] you are so wonderful Lord and so
[16:09] merciful and so kind. Lord, we thank you
[16:12] for the privilege of being here once
[16:14] more. And God, we're asking that you
[16:16] would one more time, Lord, feed your
[16:18] sheep. You'd come on the scene according
[16:21] to your promise, Lord, and that you
[16:22] would just feed us of your own hand. May
[16:24] we receive from you, Lord, the word, the
[16:27] everliving fountain, the word of eternal
[16:30] life, Lord, that brings us strength.
[16:33] God, may we bring you glory in all we
[16:35] say and do. May we honor your name and
[16:37] glorify your name as we receive your
[16:39] word. Take this vessel of mine under
[16:41] your control, Lord. Now, as I yield
[16:43] myself to you, may we all, Lord, yield
[16:46] ourselves to you, that we might hear
[16:47] with the right hearing that you might
[16:50] give us revelation and understanding
[16:52] that we might take the word that you've
[16:53] given to us and may it turn into a
[16:55] manifested life. For Lord, we love you
[16:58] and that's our desire. That's our
[17:00] purpose on this earth and we want to
[17:02] fill that purpose, Lord. God, may you
[17:04] have your way with us this evening. We
[17:06] pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[17:10] Amen. Amen. God bless you all. It's good
[17:13] to see you all this evening. Amen. I
[17:15] just want to say how much I enjoyed the
[17:18] picnic on Monday. It was beautiful. The
[17:20] weather was beautiful. Somebody told me
[17:22] that that was the largest crowd we'd
[17:24] ever had on a Memorial Day picnic. And I
[17:26] said, "That's because we have too many
[17:27] fair weather friends." Cuz the weather
[17:30] was perfect. Amen. If it was raining, we
[17:33] you know, who knows? But we thank God
[17:34] for the weather. It was glorious. and I
[17:37] enjoyed the fellowship very much. Also
[17:39] very much want to express our
[17:40] appreciation for brother Benjamin and
[17:41] Sister Amanda and their family for
[17:43] allowing us to use that place. It's been
[17:45] quite a blessing for the last number of
[17:47] years. Also all the young men who helped
[17:49] set up and clean up. God bless you all
[17:51] so very much. And then all those the
[17:53] brothers who grilled and those who
[17:54] brought food and we just we appreciated
[17:57] the day. It was wonderful. So God was
[18:00] good. Amen. While we're standing, let's
[18:02] take our Bibles together and and let's
[18:05] turn to the book of John, the Gospel of
[18:07] John, um, chapter 14. And I just want to
[18:12] welcome a few visitors. We've got Sister
[18:14] Tony Cornelen here from Missouri. God
[18:17] bless you, Sister Tony. She's been here
[18:18] visiting before. So, it's good to have
[18:20] you here as well. And, uh, Brother Chris
[18:22] take his family's back there. God bless
[18:24] you, brother Chris. It's good to have
[18:25] you. He sent me a text, let me know he's
[18:27] in town. Said he needed haircuts. I was
[18:30] like, that's a long ways to drive for
[18:32] haircuts. But but hey, praise the Lord.
[18:34] We're happy to have you. God bless you
[18:36] all. It's good to have you here. And I
[18:37] saw Sister Linda Wood sisters here. God
[18:39] bless you. It's good to have you both
[18:41] with us again. Amen. You're all very
[18:43] welcome. Amen. Let's look here at John
[18:46] chapter 14 as we begin. I'm sorry, John
[18:49] chapter 15. John chapter 15 verse 4 and
[18:54] verse
[18:55] 5 says, "Abide in me and I in you. As
[18:59] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[19:01] except it abide in the vine, no more can
[19:03] ye except you abide in me. I am the
[19:06] vine, ye are the branches. He that abide
[19:08] in me and I in him. The same bringeth
[19:11] forth much fruit. For without me you can
[19:14] do nothing." Amen. God bless you as you
[19:17] have your seats. What a true statement.
[19:19] Without me, you can do nothing. Amen.
[19:22] We're continuing with the same thought
[19:24] that we've been on for a while of God in
[19:27] partnership with man. This would be part
[19:29] four. Amen. And I hope you're not
[19:32] getting tired of the subject. I'm
[19:33] certainly not getting tired of it. It's
[19:35] so rare for me to preach four parts of
[19:37] anything. So, it's been unusual. So,
[19:40] it's been kind of exciting. It's been
[19:41] kind of fun. Um, so for a subtitle, I
[19:44] took unlimited possibilities. So, we're
[19:46] looking at this God in partnership with
[19:48] man. And that's very much what the vine
[19:50] and the branches symbolize. It's a
[19:52] partnership. Amen. It's the vine and
[19:54] it's the branches. And the branches can
[19:56] do nothing without the vine. So it must
[19:58] abide in the vine. And the life of the
[20:00] vine will come through the branches and
[20:02] bear fruit. But brother Benham says
[20:04] neither does the vine bear fruit. The
[20:06] branches bear fruit. So there is a
[20:07] partnership here. Amen. And and that's
[20:10] the partnership that God designed.
[20:12] That's the way God was going to manifest
[20:14] himself in this world is that he chose
[20:16] to partner himself with man. Amen. And
[20:19] so there we are, the vine and the
[20:21] branches. He said in John 20, some of
[20:23] this is a review. John 20:21, "Then said
[20:26] Jesus to them again, peace be unto you,
[20:29] as my father has sent me, even so send I
[20:32] you." And when he had said this, he had
[20:34] breathed on them and said unto them,
[20:36] receive ye the Holy Ghost. So, brother
[20:37] Rem tells us the same way that God sent
[20:39] Jesus, the way Jesus sends us, is he
[20:42] goes in us. Amen. And then in souls that
[20:45] are in prison now, he says, "Therefore,
[20:48] he has partnershipped, you see, and
[20:50] taken this man earthly and his eternal
[20:53] spirit and put them together." Praise be
[20:56] to God. Amen. This is our partnership.
[20:59] This man earthly and his eternal spirit
[21:02] and put them together. And and the the
[21:04] reason I love this quote is one, it's
[21:06] the foundation for the whole study that
[21:08] we're on, the whole subject, but two is
[21:11] God took this man earthly.
[21:15] So you can't make your earthly man of no
[21:17] value because God wanted it in the
[21:19] partnership. So many times we we, you
[21:22] know, we struggle with our own earthly
[21:24] man. We struggle with our own hybrid
[21:25] nature. Amen. And so there's so many
[21:27] struggles that we have till we begin to
[21:29] to hate ourselves and hate the way we're
[21:32] made and hate all these other things.
[21:34] But we have to be careful because
[21:35] there's a fine line to that because
[21:37] that's the vessel God chose to use in
[21:39] this age. So there's certain things
[21:41] about it we don't trust. Certain things
[21:43] about it we dislike. Amen. But we can't
[21:45] discard the whole thing because God
[21:47] decided to take the earthly man even in
[21:50] the fallen condition and unite it with
[21:52] his spirit together so he could be
[21:54] partnership together with us. He wants
[21:56] to work through man, even fallen man.
[21:59] That's why Christ came and shed his
[22:00] blood so that he would have a
[22:02] sanctifying power that could wash us so
[22:04] that he could finally get back in
[22:06] mankind because sin had separated them.
[22:09] So it was God above us. Then it was God
[22:12] with us in Jesus Christ. But he came
[22:14] that way. Amen. So that he could give
[22:17] his life. So that he could shed his
[22:18] blood. So that he could sanctify the
[22:20] center, the repentant center, so that he
[22:22] could get back inside man again. And
[22:24] brother Benham said that was God working
[22:26] his way back into man. So the whole
[22:29] redemption story, amen, is God wanting
[22:31] to come back into this union with man
[22:34] and manifest himself on the earth
[22:36] through man. Praise God. So don't ever
[22:40] think that your flesh is worthless.
[22:43] It's not in the hands of God. In your
[22:46] own hands, of your own strength, and
[22:48] your own mind, it's it's dilapidated,
[22:51] friends. it it's it's it's it's headed
[22:54] for destruction but in the hands of God
[22:56] it becomes a useful tool for him to
[22:58] declare his glory by bringing his spirit
[23:00] to live his life. Brother Rem says this
[23:03] in the token after the token
[23:04] desperations was preached in the
[23:06] evening. He said the token is the token.
[23:09] It's you and Christ as persons together.
[23:12] It's the Holy Spirit his life in you
[23:15] working his own life through you. And
[23:17] it's for the rich, the poor, or for
[23:20] whosoever will receive it. Can you
[23:23] receive it? Can you receive it as a
[23:25] fundamental truth of the gospel that God
[23:28] wants to live in you, dwell in you, work
[23:30] in you, and manifest himself in you?
[23:33] Amen. The way you are with all the
[23:35] things that go together, but he still
[23:37] wants to use it for his glory.
[23:40] Praise be to God. That gives us such
[23:42] purpose in life.
[23:45] You know, that's the thing that drives
[23:47] away uh uh aimlessness and depression
[23:50] and all these other things because when
[23:52] you live a purposeless life, Amen. then
[23:54] all of a sudden you try to chase some of
[23:56] the things in this world that bring
[23:58] satisfaction. But at the end of the day,
[24:00] there's nothing that can bring
[24:02] satisfaction. No pleasures, no joys,
[24:04] they all leave you bankrupt at the end.
[24:06] And they always leave you reaching for
[24:08] more. It's an endless well. Amen. You
[24:10] can never fill it with water. And so
[24:12] life becomes purposeless, aimless.
[24:14] That's that's what Solomon realized when
[24:16] Solomon tried he he set his heart to
[24:19] every vanity that was under the sun. And
[24:21] he tried wine and he tried women and he
[24:23] tried entertainment and he he went for
[24:26] everything. And at the end he says it's
[24:27] all vanity of vanities. And everything
[24:29] under the sun is vanity.
[24:33] Solomon with all of his wisdom he he
[24:35] tried it tried it all and it was
[24:39] vanity. But oh, praise God. In the midst
[24:42] of vanity, God has brought a great
[24:44] purpose into our lives. So now we wake
[24:47] up in the morning with purpose. We lay
[24:49] down with purpose. We live with purpose.
[24:52] Amen. That's what takes away despair.
[24:55] It's what takes away depression. That's
[24:57] what takes away all these things is
[24:59] because I'm not just here grubbing it
[25:01] out on my own. I'm here because God
[25:03] brought me here for a purpose. I'm here
[25:05] because God wants to use me for a
[25:07] purpose. I may not understand what's
[25:09] happening every day in my life and I may
[25:10] not even see the purpose, but I believe
[25:12] the gospel that there's a purpose for my
[25:14] life. Amen.
[25:16] Amen. And God wanted to partnership with
[25:20] me.
[25:21] Amen.
[25:23] Amen.
[25:26] He says in the rising of the sun, I just
[25:28] want to see him manifested. How can you
[25:30] do it? Call him down. No, he is in you.
[25:34] See, he's in you. Well then, Lord, if I
[25:36] can get myself out of the way, you can
[25:39] manifest. Amen. And we said this before.
[25:42] I'm going to repeat some of the things
[25:44] I've said because they fit so well in
[25:46] the context of what we want to say. But
[25:48] God, Brother Bam, was teaching us a
[25:49] lesson that if we can get ourselves out
[25:51] of the way. Amen. Then it's no more us,
[25:54] then it's God, but it's God using us.
[25:57] So, we have to get ourselves out of the
[25:59] way so that he can use us. So that
[26:03] everything he's doing is through us, but
[26:05] it's not us because we got us out of the
[26:07] way so he can use us. It's not me, it's
[26:10] him, but it's him and me. And he wants
[26:12] to use me, but it's not me. So I It
[26:14] can't be me, but it has to be him using
[26:16] me. See, he he can't do it without you.
[26:20] We come to the end of the day, we
[26:21] realize that he's got to have mankind to
[26:24] work through. He's got to have somebody.
[26:26] He has no eyes but your eyes, no mouth,
[26:28] but your mouth, no hands but your hands.
[26:30] He has chose to work through man. He set
[26:32] his program that way and we can't change
[26:34] his program. He already set the program
[26:36] that way that God will use man.
[26:40] Amen. And so now as we realize the truth
[26:44] of God partnership with man and God
[26:46] wants to use man, then when we get into
[26:48] trouble, we get into need, we get into
[26:50] times where God's got to come on the
[26:52] scene, it says uh we want to see
[26:54] manifested. We want God to manifest
[26:56] himself in the situations in our lives
[26:58] where we need healing or deliverance or
[27:00] answers or direction or whatever it is
[27:02] that we need. We need God to manifest.
[27:04] So what are we going to do? Call him
[27:06] down?
[27:08] No. He's in you.
[27:11] You see, so many times we we we are born
[27:15] with a carnal mind. How many of you were
[27:18] born with a perfectly spiritual mind?
[27:22] No, we're born with a carnal mind. We're
[27:25] raised up in a carnal world. Everything
[27:28] we learn has to do with carnality.
[27:30] Everything we have to and I don't mean
[27:31] wickedness. Carnality is not wicked.
[27:33] Carnality means natural. It's the
[27:35] natural world. We learn uh everything we
[27:37] know about the natural world which has
[27:39] limitations. It's got laws of nature.
[27:41] It's got laws of gravity. It's got
[27:43] different laws of thermodynamics and all
[27:45] kinds of laws of physics. And the world
[27:47] operates by that. And because of that,
[27:49] it's put barriers on our thinking.
[27:52] Amen. And so we we we come into
[27:56] situations where we think we we've been
[27:59] trained all of our lives to think
[28:00] carnally, but now we get into a
[28:02] situation where carnal thinking's not
[28:04] working
[28:06] anymore. And and now how is he going to
[28:09] manifest? How can you do it? Call him
[28:11] down. That's carnal thinking.
[28:15] Carnal thinking is thinking that I'm in
[28:18] a situation and I need God to come on
[28:20] the scene and so I'm going to call God
[28:22] down. God, would you come down and come
[28:24] and help me? And God, would you come and
[28:26] help me? But Brother Bam's trying to
[28:28] teach us that he's already in you. He's
[28:31] not far away. He's only as far away as
[28:33] you put him because he's not far away.
[28:36] If you've been born again by the baptism
[28:38] of the Holy Ghost and Christ dwells in
[28:40] you, amen, he's not coming and going and
[28:42] coming and going. He's there in you with
[28:45] you sharing your life with you. So it's
[28:48] not that we it's not that we have to
[28:50] call uh Christ into our troubles. We
[28:55] took him into our
[28:59] troubles. He's already there. If we
[29:02] could just learn to rest and recognize
[29:04] that he's already there and and not this
[29:09] is this is this is for me. It's not for
[29:11] you. This is for me. I want so badly,
[29:15] and I've said this before, but I mean it
[29:16] to stop going into panic mode every time
[29:18] something goes wrong.
[29:21] Amen. I I I want so badly to graduate
[29:25] past that. Amen. Going into absolute
[29:28] panic and hysterics on the inside and
[29:30] nervousness and anxiety and all and you
[29:32] know, you'll never stop the flesh but
[29:34] being flesh. But oh, how I want the
[29:36] inside, man, to take control of the
[29:37] outside man so much quicker than I have
[29:40] in the past. And I want to say, calm
[29:42] down. Everything's fine. God hasn't went
[29:45] anywhere. He hasn't changed his mind
[29:47] about us. He He already knew before the
[29:49] foundation of the world. Brother Benham
[29:51] said he knew every gnat,
[29:54] how many times it would bat its wings
[29:56] and how much tallow it would generate.
[29:58] Yeah.
[30:02] If he knows that about a gnat,
[30:05] what does he know about my life? What
[30:07] does he foresaw? What does he
[30:09] understand? Where's he at? Amen.
[30:12] It there's nothing out of
[30:15] control. From the carnal's perspective,
[30:17] it seems out of control, but it's never
[30:19] actually out of control. And brother Bam
[30:22] said, "Many times God lets us get in
[30:24] that situation to see what we'll do
[30:25] about it." Many of those things it seems
[30:28] like we shouldn't be here. God shouldn't
[30:30] have allowed it. If God's with us, then
[30:32] why are these things this way? If God's
[30:34] in me, then why am I going this way? And
[30:36] why did I make the mistake? And why did
[30:38] I fail? We ask ourselves all of these
[30:40] questions, but God allows all of these
[30:43] things to mold us, to shape us, to teach
[30:45] us, to train us, to grow us up to to to
[30:48] be in his very image. So we we we need
[30:53] these things.
[30:54] Amen. Jehovah Jar says, "Lord, if we
[30:58] will do our part, you're able to provide
[31:01] for your part. May it be so. Father, we
[31:05] talked before about brother. He told us
[31:07] he takes the
[31:09] earthly, amen, the man of the earth, and
[31:12] he takes the spirit, and he puts them
[31:14] together. He's partnership with
[31:15] man. So, what is our part to do? Well,
[31:19] we've got the natural part to do. We've
[31:21] got to take this body and we've got to
[31:22] carry it to the places he wants to go.
[31:24] We got to open our mouth and speak by
[31:26] inspiration. We've got to go as he leads
[31:29] us to go. We have a part to play and
[31:31] ours is the natural part. But God has a
[31:33] part to play. And he said, "If we'll do
[31:36] our part, you're able to provide for
[31:38] your part." So, we've been looking so
[31:42] much at our partnership with man. And
[31:45] we've been talking so much about our
[31:47] responsibility and the natural part and
[31:49] what we do. But I I just want to focus
[31:52] on on the partnership from another
[31:55] perspective. Who is our partner?
[31:58] Hallelujah. We've been talking about who
[32:00] God's partner is, but who's our partner?
[32:04] Well, our partner is God. So, there
[32:07] should be some benefits to this
[32:08] partnership.
[32:11] Amen. I was thinking uh I was thinking
[32:14] today if I was in business and my
[32:16] partner was Warren Buffett,
[32:19] he's my business partner, Warren
[32:20] Buffett, one of the richest men in the
[32:22] world, got billions and billions of
[32:24] dollars and and all of a sudden, you
[32:26] know, my part is to do paperwork and do
[32:28] whatever these other things and he's got
[32:30] his part. and all of a sudden we get a
[32:32] notice in the mail that we've got a
[32:34] debt, we've got a bill, we've got
[32:35] $10,000 we got to pay and there's no
[32:38] money in the bank and I don't have any
[32:39] money to pay for it. And I I don't have
[32:41] to go into panic mode because I have a
[32:43] partner
[32:45] and my partner is one of the richest men
[32:47] in the whole world. So $10,000 to me is
[32:50] an insurmountable amount. I can't pay
[32:52] it. I don't have what it takes to pay
[32:54] it. If it's up to me, we're going to
[32:56] fail. But praise God, I'm not in this
[32:58] thing by myself. I've got a partner.
[33:02] Amen. And you realize if God chose you
[33:05] for a partner, then you've got God for a
[33:07] partner.
[33:09] [Laughter]
[33:11] Oh, it makes me happy. Amen. The one who
[33:13] created everything. The one who sustains
[33:15] it by his word. Amen. The one who is
[33:17] life himself, the fountain of living
[33:19] water. Amen. He who created it all.
[33:21] Knows it all. Knows the end from the
[33:23] beginning. He's my partner.
[33:26] Thank God. Amen.
[33:29] Now, Matthew 13 says, "And it came to
[33:32] pass that when Jesus had finished these
[33:35] parables, he departed thence. And when
[33:38] he was come into his own country, he
[33:39] taught them in their synagogue, in so
[33:41] much that they were astonished, and
[33:43] said, "Whence hath this man this wisdom
[33:45] and these mighty works? Is not this the
[33:48] carpenter's son? Is not this his mother
[33:50] called Mary? Is not his mother called
[33:52] Mary, and his brethren James and Joseph,
[33:54] and Simon, and Judas, and his sisters?
[33:56] Are they not all with us?
[33:58] Whence then hath this man all these
[34:00] things? And they were offended in him?
[34:02] But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is
[34:04] not without honor, save in his own
[34:06] country, in his own house. And he did
[34:08] not many mighty works there because of
[34:12] their
[34:13] unbelief. So what was
[34:17] prohibiting Christ from doing many
[34:20] mighty works? It wasn't his strength or
[34:23] his ability.
[34:25] He had the ability. Yes, he could do it
[34:29] cuz he proved it in other places. He
[34:32] could raise the dead. He could open
[34:33] blind eyes. He could heal all manner of
[34:34] sick. There were other places he would
[34:36] go. And it says he would heal all the
[34:39] sick and the afflicted that were in the
[34:40] city.
[34:42] So he has the ability, the power to heal
[34:45] them all. But here there's a limitation,
[34:48] amen, to the expression or the
[34:49] manifestation of that power. And the
[34:51] problem is not with him. The problem is
[34:54] in the people who don't believe.
[34:58] So it was a lack of faith that was the
[35:01] inhibiting of the manifestation of God.
[35:04] It wasn't the power of God. Now bring
[35:07] that into our partnership. There's no
[35:09] limit to God and no limit to what God
[35:11] can do. There's only one limit and the
[35:13] limit is to what our faith will allow
[35:15] him to do in our lives.
[35:19] Amen. So, what has God asked us to do in
[35:22] the partnership? When we've done all
[35:23] that we can do, when we've done all that
[35:26] we can do, we've done everything we know
[35:27] to do and everything his word says to do
[35:29] and we've done all that we know to do,
[35:32] then the only thing left to do is
[35:34] believe.
[35:35] Amen. Believe. Because there's a barrier
[35:39] of unbelief that he's not going to push
[35:42] past. So, let's go back to our analogy.
[35:46] Warren Buffett, your partner.
[35:49] But if you never write him a letter, if
[35:51] you never send him a text, if you never
[35:53] tell him, I need help,
[35:56] then you never get the benefit of the
[35:58] partnership.
[36:00] Or if Warren says, "Listen, I don't have
[36:03] time to deal with some of these things.
[36:04] You deal with them. If you get into
[36:05] trouble, you need money, you need
[36:06] anything, just let me know. I'll take
[36:08] care of it." But if you don't believe
[36:11] it,
[36:13] you never act on it. Or if he sends you
[36:16] a text, say, "Hey, you know, I'll send
[36:18] you the money." And you think, "No way.
[36:20] He's not. He don't care about me.
[36:23] He see what's inhibiting is not the
[36:26] power of the partner."
[36:28] What's inhibiting the manifestation is
[36:30] the faith.
[36:32] Our faith.
[36:35] Amen. I'm happy with the partner we
[36:37] have. I'm so thankful that God chose to
[36:40] partnership with us. The problem is not
[36:42] with him. Amen. I He's imperfection in
[36:45] every way. Amen. I'm just asking God,
[36:48] Lord, increase my faith.
[36:50] Lord, I believe. Help down my unbelief.
[36:53] Amen. Because that's the only barrier
[36:55] that we've got, friends. And I'm saying,
[36:56] God, open my eyes. Give me more eyes to
[36:59] have. Give me give me more whatever I
[37:01] need, more understanding, more
[37:03] revelation to believe.
[37:07] Mark 9:23 Jesus said unto them unto
[37:09] them, "If thou canst believe, all things
[37:12] are possible to him that believe." Why?
[37:16] Because Christ is here. We're in
[37:18] partnership.
[37:20] I want to go back for a minute and I
[37:22] just want to look at uh uh in the Exodus
[37:24] here in chapter 4, we've been talking
[37:27] about Moses in the Exodus journey, how
[37:29] God partnershipped with Moses to deliver
[37:31] his people. And God says, "I've come
[37:33] down to deliver. Now I send you. And so
[37:36] God was going to deliver, but he was
[37:38] going to do it in partnership with
[37:40] Moses.
[37:42] Now, in order to do so, Moses was, you
[37:44] know, we we went through all of this
[37:45] where Moses was having this dialogue
[37:47] with God and saying, "I can't do it."
[37:49] And God now tells them, "Hey, listen.
[37:52] What's that in your hand?" And he says,
[37:54] "A rod." I wish I would have brought a
[37:55] big stick up
[37:57] here. A rod. He said, "Cast it down and
[37:59] turn into a serpent." Listen, I
[38:02] mentioned before, but how long had Moses
[38:05] carried that rod?
[38:09] That rod hadn't done anything for Moses
[38:12] except what he intended for, what he
[38:15] used it for, and hurting the sheep and
[38:18] the goats. He He was tending the flocks
[38:21] of his father-in-law, Jethro. He picked
[38:22] up that stick somewhere along the way,
[38:24] and that became a shepherd's staff. And
[38:26] he was using that rod in his in his
[38:29] daily occupation. He was using it in the
[38:32] position in the place that he was in
[38:33] according to his occupation. He was
[38:36] using it. So he carried it daily. He
[38:38] used it all the time. And he didn't
[38:40] realize there was any significant power
[38:42] in it. He didn't realize it could do
[38:43] anything to manifest the power of God or
[38:46] vindicate his ministry. He had no idea
[38:48] what he was holding in his hand. Amen.
[38:51] To him it was just a dry dead stick.
[38:54] Amen.
[38:56] But when God, amen, wanted to work
[38:58] through Moses in partnership with Moses
[39:00] and had to vindicate Moses, the old dry
[39:02] stick became more than a dry stick. It
[39:04] became a mighty sign that God was
[39:06] vindicating this man to be his prophet.
[39:09] And he throw it down and turn to a
[39:10] serpent. That was not anything that
[39:12] Moses had the power to do. He needed his
[39:15] partner to do that part to vindicate who
[39:17] this his mouthpiece was going to be. But
[39:19] Moses had to be the one to carry the
[39:21] stick. God couldn't carry that stick
[39:24] down to Egypt to show the sign. That was
[39:26] Moses's part of the partnership. Amen.
[39:30] But when Moses dropped it according to
[39:32] the what the Lord told him to show the
[39:34] sign to Pharaoh, Amen. when he gave it
[39:36] to Aaron and Aaron threw it down. Amen.
[39:38] It was God who had to turn it into a
[39:40] servant cuz Moses couldn't do that part.
[39:43] That was partnership.
[39:46] But what it strikes me is what did God
[39:48] use? And then he said, "Here's another
[39:50] sign. Take your hand and put it in your
[39:53] bosom. Pull it out. It becomes leprosy.
[39:55] Amen. White with leprosy. Now put it in
[39:57] again and bring it out. And now it
[39:59] become fresh and clean again. And what
[40:01] was God using? God was using things that
[40:04] were common to Moses. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[40:08] The things that Moses already had. Yeah.
[40:11] Things that were already common and
[40:13] normal to Moses. His own hand, his own
[40:15] rod. Listen, brother said, don't look
[40:18] for great big things. Just go the way
[40:20] you are. Amen. God has already equipped
[40:22] you. God has already been training you.
[40:24] God has been using you all along the
[40:26] way. He's not going to completely
[40:28] restructure you and change you. He's
[40:30] going to use you the way you are.
[40:34] Praise be to God.
[40:36] Let's look at this one now. In Judges 3,
[40:39] Shamgar said, "After him was Shamgar,
[40:41] the son of Anath, which slew the
[40:44] Philistines, 600 men with an ox goat,
[40:46] and he also delivered Israel." Here we
[40:48] see the same kind of thing. We have
[40:50] Shamgar. Amen. Shamgar doesn't know that
[40:53] God is going to partner with him to
[40:56] bring a deliverance for
[40:58] Israel. He's in the same affliction
[41:00] everybody else is in. He's in the same
[41:02] trouble of mind. He's suffering the same
[41:04] way everybody else is. But all the
[41:06] sudden something by inspiration comes
[41:08] over him. And is what is that? That's
[41:10] the spirit of God anointing him for the
[41:12] position. And what does God use? God God
[41:15] uses his ox code. That's right. Amen.
[41:18] What is his ox code? An ox code is a
[41:20] token of his occupation. It's a tool
[41:23] that he used all the time in his farming
[41:26] career.
[41:28] He didn't give him new tools.
[41:32] Oh, I hope this starts to strike home.
[41:34] Yeah. We've got to stop thinking when I
[41:37] get this and when I get that and when I
[41:39] become and when I'm better or when I get
[41:41] gifts or when I get Listen, God has
[41:43] already been training you for the job.
[41:45] It's already all around you.
[41:48] He's fashioned you and made you and he's
[41:50] got you to a certain place and wants to
[41:52] use you. And the most common thing that
[41:54] you think is nothing. Amen. When God
[41:57] takes control becomes the very thing
[41:59] that'll bring deliverance. Amen. You
[42:01] say, "But my personality, God can use
[42:04] that personality for his glory. But I'm
[42:06] this." God can use that for his glory.
[42:08] But my little talent is this, and my
[42:10] little gift isn't much. But listen,
[42:12] don't think about it like that. to to to
[42:14] Sheamgar that ox code was nothing but a
[42:17] tool to move the ox along and to guide
[42:19] them in their daily work. To him it had
[42:21] no other significant purpose but a tool
[42:24] in his occupation. But to God it became
[42:26] a weapon of deliverance that'll kill 600
[42:29] Philistines.
[42:31] Amen.
[42:34] We we we
[42:38] must realize the benefits of our
[42:40] partnership. Amen.
[42:42] God can take the most what seems to us
[42:45] insignificant thing in our life and he
[42:48] can use it for deliverance.
[42:50] Amen. Amen. We don't even have to
[42:52] understand it. All we have to do is
[42:54] yield to it. Amen. And God will do
[42:57] it. here in 1 Samuel's the story of
[43:01] David and it says and it came to pass
[43:03] when the Philistines arose and came and
[43:05] drew nigh to meet David not David hast
[43:08] that David hastened and ran toward the
[43:10] army to meet the Philistine and David
[43:12] put his hand in his bag and took the
[43:14] took then a stone and slang it and
[43:16] smokeote the Philistine in his forehead
[43:18] that the stone sunk into his forehead
[43:20] and he fell upon the face to the earth
[43:22] so David prevailed over the Philistine
[43:24] with a sling and with a stone and
[43:26] smokeote the Philistine and slew him.
[43:28] But there was no sword in the hand of
[43:30] David. Therefore, David ran and stood
[43:32] upon the Philistine and took a sword and
[43:34] drew it out of the sheath thereof and
[43:36] slew him and cut off his head therewith.
[43:38] And when the Philistines saw their
[43:40] champion was dead, they
[43:42] fled. David, we we know the story well.
[43:45] We won't rehearse the whole thing, but
[43:47] David goes to Saul and he knows that God
[43:52] will deliver this
[43:54] Philistine, but he has nothing proper to
[43:57] fight him with. He has no proper
[44:00] weapons. And brother Ben takes the armor
[44:01] of Saul that they tried to put on him
[44:03] and he he makes that theological
[44:05] training and many of the places he tells
[44:07] the story and David said, "I can't go at
[44:09] any of this. I've got to go the way
[44:10] God's made me. the way God's trained me,
[44:14] the way God's used me, I got to go the
[44:15] way that I am and the way that I
[44:17] understand and the way that works for
[44:19] me. I'm ad libing. Okay,
[44:23] [Applause]
[44:25] but but God had already trained him
[44:28] because when he was on the back side of
[44:29] a desert, amen, before he gets to this
[44:32] level of trial, God lets another trial
[44:34] come up and God uses what's in his hand,
[44:37] amen, to deliver, Amen, the bear, and to
[44:39] deliver the lion. And what was God
[44:41] doing? God was training him and building
[44:43] confidence in him that you can be what
[44:45] you are and you can use what's in your
[44:47] hand and you don't have to go uh you
[44:50] don't have to become a super duper this.
[44:52] Amen. Just be what you are. Deliverance
[44:55] can come through your prayer.
[44:56] Deliverance can come through your hand.
[44:58] Deliverance can come in whatever fashion
[45:00] you are. Praise God. God can use you.
[45:05] And God used
[45:07] David. And David
[45:09] had a
[45:11] sling, a
[45:13] slingshot, but it was enough because
[45:16] David wasn't alone. David wasn't all by
[45:19] himself. God was with him. Now, when he
[45:23] comes to fight the giant that all the
[45:25] men in armor and all the men with spears
[45:26] and all the men, Amen, swords are afraid
[45:29] of, he goes with the thing that was in
[45:32] his hand. He goes not as a warrior, not
[45:37] as a soldier, but he goes as a shepherd
[45:39] boy under an anointing.
[45:42] He goes as he
[45:44] was. Oh, friends, I hope that this can
[45:48] build us strength to just trust in what
[45:50] God's done in our lives. Just
[45:53] trusting. Amen. We always want to be
[45:56] different. I don't know about you, but I
[45:58] I spent most of my life wanting to be
[46:00] different. Especially when I was a
[46:02] teenager, I'd stare in the mirror and I
[46:04] wish my ears were different. I wish my
[46:06] nose was different. I wish all these
[46:07] things were different. I wish my
[46:09] shoulders were
[46:11] broader. I wish my chest was
[46:14] deeper. But you know what? Wishing
[46:16] didn't get me anything. Amen. But all my
[46:19] life, God's been with me. I look back
[46:22] and I see he's brought me through time
[46:25] after time, trial after trial. And it
[46:28] wasn't when I became a super duper
[46:30] something that God brought deliverance.
[46:31] God did it all along the way. Whatever
[46:34] stage I was in, whatever condition I was
[46:36] in, God, he helped me. We came through.
[46:40] I had a partner through it all to do the
[46:42] things that I couldn't do. And he's
[46:44] brought me out of things that I couldn't
[46:45] see any way out of, any way over, any
[46:47] way under. There was conditions and
[46:49] situations in my life I didn't know how
[46:52] was going to change. But God came and
[46:53] did the part I couldn't do. Amen. Amen.
[46:57] But he didn't have to I didn't have to
[47:00] go get theological training.
[47:03] I didn't have to go get new weapons. I
[47:05] didn't have to go get All I had to do
[47:07] was stay as I was and trust God. And God
[47:10] would use me and work with me and in me
[47:12] and through me and others around me to
[47:13] bring me through the trial.
[47:17] That's partnership, friends. That when I
[47:20] come to the end of my ability, then I
[47:22] don't lose heart because I have a
[47:24] partner. Amen. I've got somebody who's
[47:26] going to cover my gaps. I've got
[47:28] somebody who can add to when I run out
[47:30] of. I got somebody who knows more when I
[47:32] run out of knowledge. I've got somebody
[47:34] with more power when mine's come to an
[47:36] end. So, I don't need to be nervous when
[47:38] I come to the end of power, to the end
[47:40] of knowledge, to the end of
[47:41] understanding. I don't need to get
[47:43] nervous because I have a partner who can
[47:45] cover for me. Amen. Amen.
[47:48] Hebrews 11:6 it says, "But without faith
[47:52] it is impossible to please him. For he
[47:54] that cometh to God must believe that he
[47:56] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[47:58] that diligently seek him."
[48:04] See,
[48:06] sometimes our
[48:08] part is just to believe
[48:12] because God can't do anything unless
[48:14] somebody will believe his word.
[48:17] Sometimes we get into situations and I
[48:20] and it's by design. God allows it. You
[48:22] get to the place where you run out of
[48:24] all
[48:25] options and and while you have options,
[48:28] you take them. While you while you can
[48:29] do something, you do it. That's part of
[48:32] your responsibility. That's part of your
[48:33] natural part. That's part of doing what
[48:35] you can do. Yes. But when you've come to
[48:38] the end of everything and you have no
[48:40] other options and you can't think of
[48:42] anything else to do and everything you
[48:44] tried has failed and you come to what
[48:46] seems like a dead end. Amen. You realize
[48:48] with God there's no such thing as a dead
[48:50] end.
[48:52] Amen. There's no such thing. And what
[48:54] God needs out of his partner now is
[48:57] somebody that will believe because he
[49:00] can do it if we can believe. But if we
[49:03] don't believe,
[49:05] right? It may just be like it was in
[49:08] capernium. He could not dare do many
[49:10] mighty works because of their unbelief.
[49:14] Brother Bram says in the key to the door
[49:17] he says he is the door to
[49:19] heaven and there is no other door no
[49:22] other way but through Jesus Christ. He
[49:24] is the door to heaven and now Jesus is
[49:26] the door to all these things and faith
[49:28] is the key that unlocks the door. Now,
[49:30] if Jesus is the door to all these
[49:32] promises of God, faith in his finished
[49:34] work unlocks every door to every
[49:36] treasure there is inside of the kingdom
[49:38] of God. See, faith is the key that
[49:40] unlocks every promise he makes.
[49:44] So, what's going to unlock the promise
[49:45] of deliverance? Faith. What'll unlock
[49:48] the promise of healing? Faith. Amen.
[49:51] It'll take faith. He says uh in the
[49:55] everpresent water from the rock he says
[49:58] when we die our souls will go under the
[50:00] altar of God where I was privileged to
[50:01] see a few mornings ago as you know in
[50:03] the vision where the Bible speaks of our
[50:05] spirits will go to to God who give it
[50:07] and our body shall return to the dust of
[50:09] the earth but someday where the
[50:11] scripture is fulfilled our spirits will
[50:13] be released from God will pick up the
[50:14] soul and the soul to the body and the
[50:16] power that'll rise us up is right in us
[50:19] now this is where I want to start
[50:21] picking up this quote the power that'll
[50:23] raise us up is right in us now.
[50:26] That means resurrection power is in you
[50:28] now. Amen. The power for resurrection,
[50:31] rapturing power is in you now. Amen.
[50:34] Amen. Listen, he he says the power
[50:36] that'll raise us up is right in us now.
[50:39] We are now in heavenly places. We are
[50:41] now in the power of the resurrection. If
[50:43] there wasn't a wall to that, sons and
[50:44] daughters of God would create them a
[50:46] world out there and go live a private
[50:48] life on it. You have the power in you to
[50:50] do it. If you've got a shadow of the
[50:52] power of God in you, you got power to do
[50:55] it. God is omnipotent. See what I mean?
[50:58] The power that's in you will make you
[51:00] could speak a world into existence and
[51:02] go live on it. Hallelujah. There you
[51:04] are. Do do you believe that power is in
[51:06] you? Do you believe that God is in you?
[51:09] A part of God is in you. An attribute of
[51:11] God is in you. Been quickened to life by
[51:13] the spirit of God dwelling in you. Now,
[51:15] if there's a part of God in you, Amen.
[51:18] God was the one who spoke the world into
[51:20] existence. Amen. That power is still in
[51:22] you. And it doesn't leave when you hit a
[51:25] trial. It doesn't leave when you hit a
[51:27] dark time. It doesn't leave when you get
[51:28] depressed. It doesn't leave when you run
[51:30] out of options. It doesn't disappear.
[51:32] It's always in you. The power that spoke
[51:34] the world into existence is dwelling in
[51:36] you in measure.
[51:38] Amen.
[51:40] Amen.
[51:43] He says that's what power is in the
[51:45] church now, but it is controlled by a
[51:48] law. And that law is not keeping a bunch
[51:50] of commandments. It's a law of faith.
[51:52] Jesus said, "All things are possible to
[51:54] them that believe. And if you can
[51:55] believe it, whatever God will lead your
[51:58] soul to believe, that is yours." So,
[52:01] Brother B is not teaching us that every
[52:03] whim and fancy you have that you can
[52:05] have. But everything the spirit of God
[52:08] will lead your soul to believe. Not even
[52:10] your brain. But when God when when an
[52:12] inspiration of the Holy Ghost strikes
[52:14] the seed in the soul, it's yours,
[52:16] friends. Yeah. That's it. Amen. Whatever
[52:19] God will lead your soul to believe, that
[52:21] is yours. Every place the souls of your
[52:23] foot can set upon by faith, God gives it
[52:25] to you. Amen. It's yours. You possess
[52:28] it.
[52:29] If you can find the key to this law of
[52:31] faith that opens it to you. You see what
[52:34] I mean? The power is controlled. If you
[52:36] are a son of God, you are a daughter of
[52:38] God, that never leaves you. It's with
[52:40] you all the time, but your faith gets
[52:42] away from it, but it's still there.
[52:45] This is so important to know. I I if we
[52:48] could re if we could recognize through
[52:50] our carnality, Amen. through our carnal
[52:52] mind on the very worst day of our lives,
[52:56] God is still with us.
[52:59] The life of God, the power of God is
[53:01] still in us. Nothing has changed. So, we
[53:04] need to stop acting like something has
[53:06] changed
[53:08] and just hold steady and believe God.
[53:10] Amen.
[53:12] Man, I want to look at Hebrews 11 for a
[53:14] minute and just I I like I pulled these
[53:16] little statements out. By faith Abel.
[53:20] By faith Abel. By faith Enoch. By faith
[53:24] Noah. By faith Abraham. Through faith
[53:26] also Sarah. How did everybody accomplish
[53:29] what they accomplished for the kingdom?
[53:31] How did they all overcome the obstacles
[53:32] in their life? It was always by the same
[53:34] measure. It was by faith. Amen. But by
[53:37] faith in what? By faith in what God told
[53:40] them in the day and age that they lived.
[53:41] By faith in the answer God gave. By
[53:44] faith in the instructions God gave. By
[53:46] faith in a present tense God.
[53:49] By faith Abel, what did Abel do by
[53:51] faith? Offered up a more excellent
[53:53] sacrifice. So that means there was a
[53:54] part Abel had to do.
[53:57] Abel was delivered by faith, but faith
[54:00] actually had to go into action and he
[54:02] had to actually slay the the lamb. Yeah.
[54:06] So, he did his part, but he did his part
[54:08] by faith and he was delivered. Amen.
[54:12] Enoch by faith was translated. Amen. He
[54:15] actually believed it. Amen. By faith.
[54:17] Noah Noah was saved. Amen. And his
[54:19] household was saved with him. But Noah
[54:21] actually had to build the boat.
[54:24] This is partnership with God. Amen.
[54:29] By faith, Isaac, by faith, Jacob. By
[54:32] faith, Joseph. By faith, Moses. By
[54:35] faith, they passed through the Red Sea.
[54:37] How did they pass through the Red Sea?
[54:39] By faith.
[54:41] Amen. When there was no way, when they
[54:43] came to a dead end, Amen. They They were
[54:45] at the dead end
[54:47] road. Impassable. You're finished.
[54:52] But there is no dead end with God.
[54:55] There's no such thing as a dead end with
[54:57] God. There's no such thing as end of the
[54:59] rope. You say, "I come to the end of my
[55:02] rope." Well, you might come to the end
[55:03] of your rope, but you'll never come to
[55:05] the end of the rope because God can make
[55:07] more rope.
[55:10] Amen. You're never at the end of the
[55:12] rope. You're never at a dead end. You're
[55:14] never finished. You're never washed up.
[55:16] It's never over.
[55:19] The I mean, I we we know this. This is
[55:22] not a news flash for anybody. We've
[55:23] heard it. We've heard it preached. We
[55:25] could have it preached to us every
[55:26] morning when we get out of bed. We need
[55:28] to remind ourselves these things are the
[55:30] truth because some things come along
[55:32] that way lay us that trouble our mind
[55:34] that lock us down and we start to go
[55:36] back into spiritual amnesia and start
[55:39] thinking how am I going to I can't
[55:40] overcome this is impossible I'm going to
[55:43] be destroyed I'm going to be defeated
[55:44] I'm not going to make it all those
[55:46] statements are spiritual amnesia
[55:48] statements
[55:51] because God through this message has
[55:52] awakened us to the reality of who we
[55:54] are. Amen. and where we come from and
[55:56] why we're here and where we're going and
[55:59] God's purpose will never be defeated in
[56:01] our lives and we're on partnership with
[56:02] God and God is dwelling in you. How are
[56:05] you at a dead end road? How are you
[56:07] finished? How are you at the end? Why is
[56:09] it that you're end at the end of the
[56:10] rope? It's impossible.
[56:12] Because God's dwelling in you and God's
[56:14] never come to the end of his rope.
[56:18] What is the token? It's you and Christ
[56:20] as persons together.
[56:23] So if you come to the end of the rope,
[56:24] Christ came to the end of the rope, but
[56:26] Christ is in you and he can't come to
[56:28] the end of his rope.
[56:33] Amen. Amen.
[56:37] And the anointed ones at the end time,
[56:39] brother Bham said, I wasn't the one that
[56:41] appeared down on the river. I was only
[56:44] standing there when he appeared. I'm not
[56:47] the one that performs these things and
[56:48] fortells these things that happens as
[56:50] perfect they are. I'm only one that's
[56:52] near when he does it. I was only a voice
[56:54] that he used to say. It wasn't what I
[56:56] knew. It's it's what I just surrendered
[56:59] myself to that he spoke
[57:01] through. Brother Brandham now is talking
[57:04] about partnership with
[57:06] God. Because brother Brandham said, "It
[57:08] wasn't me that was God." Amen. But then
[57:12] how did God do
[57:15] it? He says it wasn't me that appeared
[57:17] on the river. So I was only standing
[57:19] there when he appeared. who appeared
[57:21] that was Christ in the form of a pillar
[57:23] of fire. He come down but that angel of
[57:25] the Lord spoke something
[57:27] and said as John the Baptist fore in his
[57:29] first coming your message.
[57:34] Your message. Amen. That means brother
[57:36] Brennham was given a message. And then
[57:38] he was also he was also tasked with the
[57:41] responsibility of delivering that
[57:42] message. That was his part. Amen. God
[57:45] gave him the revelation. God gave him
[57:47] the word. But he's the one who had to
[57:49] get on a plane. He's the one who had to
[57:50] drive in a car. He's the one who had to
[57:52] stand in the pullpit night after night
[57:54] after night. He's the one who had to
[57:55] face rejection and go again. He's the
[57:58] one who had to get tired and keep going.
[58:00] He's the one who had to kiss his wife
[58:02] and kiss his babies and get in the car
[58:04] and drive and be gone from home for
[58:06] weeks at a time. That was his part.
[58:09] Amen.
[58:11] Amen. Was partnership with God. And
[58:14] brother Bam saying, "I wasn't the one.
[58:17] Of course not. He's not the one who
[58:19] appeared. He's not the pillar of fire.
[58:21] He's not the power. He's not the
[58:23] revelation. He's not the one.
[58:26] But the one who did all of that is in
[58:27] him. Amen. Amen. Amen. The one who did
[58:30] all of that's using him. Yeah. I was
[58:33] only a voice that he used. Amen. It
[58:36] wasn't what I thought. It's what he
[58:38] said. It's not what I did. It's what he
[58:40] did.
[58:44] You think about the the manifestation of
[58:47] the spoken word through that
[58:49] prophet. And I wrote down just a few of
[58:51] them
[58:52] here. If you think about the time that
[58:56] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[58:58] dropped in a little boat when he was
[59:00] there with two of the Banks uh the uh
[59:03] the the Woods brothers, Banks and
[59:05] Lyall, there was a little fish that was
[59:08] laying there
[59:09] dead and all of a sudden an anointing
[59:11] came, a power dropped over him and he
[59:13] stood to his feet and he said, "Little
[59:15] fishy, I give you back your life in the
[59:18] name of Jesus Christ." He said the thing
[59:20] was floating on the side and it floated
[59:21] off to the bank into some weeds or some
[59:23] reads. Been laying there dead for a
[59:25] while. He said that thing just slipped
[59:27] right up and swam away.
[59:29] Listen, a man can't do that.
[59:32] That has to be God in a man.
[59:36] But God didn't do it until the man had
[59:39] faith to speak what he was anointed to
[59:41] speak.
[59:43] That was partnership with man.
[59:47] Brother Brandham couldn't give life to
[59:48] that fish. But God was going to give
[59:51] life to the fish. But he needed a
[59:53] partner. He needed a voice. He needed
[59:56] vocal cords on the earth. He needed
[59:58] somebody to work
[1:00:00] through. Then God taught him the lesson
[1:00:04] with the squirrels, the creation of
[1:00:06] squirrels. And he's in the woods and God
[1:00:09] now starting to deal with him according
[1:00:10] to this scripture. If thou say unto this
[1:00:12] mountain, be plucked up and cast to the
[1:00:14] sea and doubt not in your heart. It
[1:00:15] shall be done as you say. And he's and
[1:00:18] he's mulling this over and he's got
[1:00:20] questions about it. And he never felt
[1:00:21] really the liberty to really preach on
[1:00:23] it. And all of a sudden, God comes and
[1:00:26] tells him, "Just speak and it'll be as
[1:00:28] you say." And he says, "What should I
[1:00:31] say?" And God is training him. He's
[1:00:34] coaching. He was teaching like brother
[1:00:35] Benjamin went through a little while
[1:00:37] back showing how God was training him
[1:00:38] because brother this wasn't brother
[1:00:40] Ram's idea. He didn't even know how to
[1:00:42] operate in this realm. God was coaching
[1:00:44] him all along the way training him.
[1:00:47] Amen. And so now he comes and he and and
[1:00:49] and he's saying but you're hunting. You
[1:00:53] have no squirrels. But first he says
[1:00:55] what do you have need of?
[1:00:57] He says you're hunting. You have no
[1:00:59] squirrels. And so he spoke squirrels
[1:01:01] into existence. Wow. And brother
[1:01:03] Brennham never said, "I spoke squirrels
[1:01:06] into existence." He says, "If he created
[1:01:09] the first squirrel, he can create all
[1:01:11] squir who he gave credit to God." Amen.
[1:01:13] He knew he couldn't create. But God was
[1:01:15] using the vocal cords of a man.
[1:01:19] You realize at any time, Brother
[1:01:21] Brandham could refuse to speak.
[1:01:24] Because God's a gentleman. He never
[1:01:25] forces. He could refuse to speak. He had
[1:01:29] to operate by faith of what was being
[1:01:31] told to him. He had to believe that was
[1:01:33] the voice of God. He had to believe that
[1:01:35] was God. And he had to speak what God
[1:01:38] was telling him. Amen. In order for it
[1:01:40] to produce.
[1:01:42] So he had to believe and he had to act
[1:01:44] on what he believed. And when he did,
[1:01:46] squirrels were created two different
[1:01:48] times. Then he was in in Colorado when a
[1:01:51] storm came up, a blizzard came up that
[1:01:52] was certain death. He said it was
[1:01:54] certain death. He was trying to run back
[1:01:55] to the camp and the voice of God said,
[1:01:57] "Go back into the storm." And we know
[1:01:58] the story. But he he told him to say
[1:02:01] whatever you say is what it will be. And
[1:02:03] he ordered
[1:02:05] nature. And he ordered nature in a
[1:02:07] situation that was life and death. Amen.
[1:02:10] Right? Life and death because of the
[1:02:12] blizzard. And he ordered nature. And
[1:02:14] nature changed according to what he
[1:02:17] said. Then he was praying for his wife's
[1:02:20] healing. She had the tumor. And he and
[1:02:22] brother Brandon was praying God, you
[1:02:24] know, help us to know what to do. He
[1:02:26] wanted the delay. She needed to have it
[1:02:28] operated on. and he wanted to delay the
[1:02:30] operation till after Christmas so they
[1:02:31] could go back to Jeffersonville. He
[1:02:33] didn't know if that was the right choice
[1:02:34] or not and he's at his ottoman and he's
[1:02:36] praying over which direction to go and
[1:02:38] she's got a doctor's appointment and
[1:02:40] she's in so much pain and all of a
[1:02:41] sudden God said stand on your feet. He
[1:02:44] stood on his feet. He says whatever you
[1:02:46] say he said before the doctor can touch
[1:02:48] her yes going to be gone and that's
[1:02:50] exactly the way it happened.
[1:02:53] This is God on partnership with man.
[1:02:56] And then we know the story of Hadtie
[1:02:57] Wright when he's telling the story of
[1:02:59] the squirrels and Hadtie says that's
[1:03:01] nothing but the truth and God was so
[1:03:02] pleased at what she said that he told
[1:03:04] brother Bam give her whatever she says
[1:03:06] and she wanted the salvation of her two
[1:03:07] boys. He said I give them to you in the
[1:03:09] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So I just
[1:03:12] want to go through these
[1:03:14] again because I believe what what God
[1:03:16] did with the life of the prophet is I
[1:03:19] believe he showed us the potential of
[1:03:22] this partnership. Amen. I believe he was
[1:03:25] showing us what a partnership with God
[1:03:27] and man was like in the end
[1:03:30] time. And in this partnership, there's
[1:03:33] power for
[1:03:35] resurrection to bring back life from the
[1:03:38] dead. There's power of creation to meet
[1:03:42] physical needs.
[1:03:47] There's power over nature for safety and
[1:03:51] security.
[1:03:54] There's power over the body for healing
[1:03:58] and there's a power for salvation. Amen.
[1:04:02] Now, if you think of all those
[1:04:03] manifestations of the spoken word that
[1:04:06] God was doing through a
[1:04:09] vessel, what else would you ever need in
[1:04:12] life? Right.
[1:04:14] I believe through these manifestations
[1:04:16] he manifest everything we could ever
[1:04:19] encounter, every obstacle we had ever
[1:04:21] come to and everything we would ever
[1:04:23] need. God already proved to that prophet
[1:04:26] that there is no dead end there. There's
[1:04:29] a partner on the scene that can bring
[1:04:31] you through everything you will ever
[1:04:33] have need of. You have need of healing,
[1:04:36] he showed it. Ne resurrection from the
[1:04:38] dead, he showed it. Amen. speaking to
[1:04:40] nature. Amen. For protection and safety.
[1:04:42] Yes. What if you have a need? You need
[1:04:44] squirrels. You have no squirrels. What
[1:04:45] if you need food? You can speak that,
[1:04:47] too. Amen. He showed us that this
[1:04:49] partnership between God and man, there
[1:04:51] is no limit. There is no boundary. There
[1:04:54] is no obstacle that can't be overcome.
[1:04:57] Even the obstacle of salvation, Amen.
[1:05:00] through that man could speak salvation
[1:05:02] to those boys. What else would you need
[1:05:05] in this world? What else could what what
[1:05:07] other circumstances you come into that
[1:05:10] he has not already proved that
[1:05:11] partnership with me is enough. What else
[1:05:14] do you need? You need life, you can have
[1:05:16] life. You need substance, you can have
[1:05:18] substance. You need them. You need
[1:05:20] nature to change. You can rearrange
[1:05:22] nature. You need healing, you can speak
[1:05:24] healing.
[1:05:25] Amen.
[1:05:28] God has brought us into this end time
[1:05:30] manifestation. Jesus Christ in bride
[1:05:32] form and he he took brother Brandham and
[1:05:34] he she took that part of the word that
[1:05:36] came to maturity and he waved it. Amen.
[1:05:38] To show us what maturity looks like,
[1:05:40] what partnership with God, what Christ
[1:05:42] living in flesh is supposed to look
[1:05:44] like. And he showed us you don't have a
[1:05:46] barrier. You don't have an obstacle. You
[1:05:48] have nothing that will defeat this
[1:05:50] partnership.
[1:05:54] We have nothing to be afraid of.
[1:05:57] That doesn't mean God will do it for you
[1:05:59] like he did the prophet. It doesn't mean
[1:06:01] it'll be a replica.
[1:06:04] But what God showed us is the
[1:06:06] possibilities, the potential to take
[1:06:08] away all fear.
[1:06:10] There's nothing in us that say God won't
[1:06:12] or God can't. Amen. I don't know what he
[1:06:14] will or what he won't do in every one of
[1:06:16] my circumstances. I cannot predict how
[1:06:18] he'll get me out, what he'll do. But I
[1:06:21] know this that God already has done so
[1:06:23] many supernatural things for me that I
[1:06:25] could not have done for myself that I I
[1:06:27] it's wrong for me to doubt him in my
[1:06:29] next trial. It's hard wrong for me to
[1:06:31] come into another obstacle and not trust
[1:06:33] the partner who bailed me out last time
[1:06:35] won't bail me out next time.
[1:06:39] Amen. You I was reading in the Bible the
[1:06:42] other day. Amen. And I was reading in
[1:06:43] the book of Acts and it said the spirit
[1:06:47] spoke unto I don't remember who it was.
[1:06:49] I don't even remember what character I
[1:06:50] was reading about. The spirit spoke unto
[1:06:53] them. And I started thinking, I've had
[1:06:56] that same experience in my life where
[1:06:58] the spirit of God spoke in my heart and
[1:07:00] what he said was exactly right.
[1:07:03] Amen. There is no barrier, friends.
[1:07:06] Amen. There's no limit because of who
[1:07:10] we're in partnership with. Amen.
[1:07:14] We are the only limiting factor to this
[1:07:18] partnership.
[1:07:19] It's just us. The only limiting partner
[1:07:22] factor of this partnership is our own
[1:07:24] thinking.
[1:07:27] You
[1:07:28] remember brother Bam tells us the story
[1:07:31] of the eagle in the chicken yard, right?
[1:07:34] We know it. Uh uh last Sunday, brother
[1:07:38] Simon, he did such a good job. He can
[1:07:39] scream like an eagle. I mean, that
[1:07:41] whistle was perfect.
[1:07:44] I thought, man, that's amazing.
[1:07:46] At first, it was a little unnerving, but
[1:07:48] I got used to it. Sounded good to me
[1:07:51] after a
[1:07:53] while. But that eagle in the chicken
[1:07:59] yard, if you could think about the
[1:08:02] limitations of that eagle,
[1:08:06] he was bound to the
[1:08:08] ground, limited by the pen that he was
[1:08:11] in. Whatever the dimensions, it was 12t
[1:08:14] by 20 foot. That was his barrier. That
[1:08:16] was his limitation. He was earthbound
[1:08:18] and limited to that. And he couldn't go
[1:08:20] beyond it. He could never explore the
[1:08:22] rest of the yard, the rest of the farm.
[1:08:24] He could never go anywhere else. He was
[1:08:26] bound. He was he was bound to the
[1:08:28] ground. And he was bound in these
[1:08:31] parameters. But the reality is he was
[1:08:34] never bound.
[1:08:37] He was never bound because when the
[1:08:38] eagle screamed, amen, and he recognized
[1:08:41] whatever that is, I am. Then that eagle
[1:08:43] began to speak back to him. You're not a
[1:08:45] chicken, you're an eagle. Your identity
[1:08:47] is not down there. You belong up here.
[1:08:49] And he said, "Mama, how do I get up
[1:08:50] there?" He said, "Just jump and flap
[1:08:52] your wings. You're already an eagle.
[1:08:54] You're not bound to the earth and you're
[1:08:55] not limited in these parameters." It was
[1:08:58] only chicken thinking that had him bound
[1:09:00] and limited. Amen. But God has not
[1:09:02] brought us to chicken thinking. He's got
[1:09:04] us to eagle thinking under an eagle
[1:09:06] scream. So we're not limited and bound
[1:09:08] by the things that we've understood by
[1:09:10] our carnal mind. Amen.
[1:09:13] By our growing up and going to school
[1:09:15] and learning physics and understanding
[1:09:17] gravity and knowing how the world works.
[1:09:19] Hey, listen. Your science teacher would
[1:09:21] never tell you that you can walk on
[1:09:22] water. Yeah. But the Bible says that I
[1:09:26] can if God bids me.
[1:09:30] Your science teacher will never tell you
[1:09:32] that you can take a few fishes and some
[1:09:34] loaves and you can feed 5,000 people.
[1:09:36] Your science teacher won't tell you that
[1:09:38] you can multiply by prayer. Yeah, but
[1:09:41] God has already showed us that he can.
[1:09:43] Your science teacher will not tell you
[1:09:44] that you can create a living organism
[1:09:47] with all fully intact out of absolutely
[1:09:50] no material whatsoever but just speaking
[1:09:52] when God tells you to speak. But God's
[1:09:54] already proved to us that he can.
[1:09:57] Amen. So we were we the only thing that
[1:09:59] binds us is the gray matter between our
[1:10:02] temples. We are not bound. Amen. We are
[1:10:05] spiritual beings, children of God. Amen.
[1:10:07] that God called to manifest him in this
[1:10:10] age. There is nothing that binds you but
[1:10:12] your own thinking.
[1:10:16] Amen. Amen. And we can't make God tell
[1:10:19] us to speak. We can't make God Amen. But
[1:10:22] we can certainly believe any moment he's
[1:10:24] about to tell me something. Any moment
[1:10:26] there's going to be a deliverance. Any
[1:10:27] second, God, I'm waiting on you. I'm
[1:10:29] believing you. Amen. I know any moment
[1:10:31] you're going to bring a deliverance,
[1:10:33] God. and I'm expecting and I'm looking
[1:10:35] for and I'm waiting for and I'm excited
[1:10:37] to see what you're going to do. That's
[1:10:39] the attitude we need to have.
[1:10:42] Not despair and defeat when we're not
[1:10:45] defeated. Not despair and discouragement
[1:10:48] when there's nothing to be discouraged
[1:10:49] about. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:53] I want to start recognizing the benefits
[1:10:56] of my partnership.
[1:10:59] Oh, it's got tremendous benefits,
[1:11:00] friends.
[1:11:03] Tremendous. Brother Bam says, "As much
[1:11:06] as your faith will be released, that's
[1:11:08] how much power you can have."
[1:11:13] So what's the limit to your power? It's
[1:11:15] only as much as your faith can be
[1:11:17] released. Remember, brother told us
[1:11:19] about the teaspoon of ocean. That God's
[1:11:22] the whole ocean, but you can take that
[1:11:24] teaspoon and you've only got a portion
[1:11:26] of the life of God. Not all of God, but
[1:11:28] a portion. But in that portion is
[1:11:30] everything that's in the ocean. So all
[1:11:33] the power and capabilities that's in the
[1:11:35] ocean is in you.
[1:11:37] So what's the limiting factor? Only
[1:11:40] faith. And there's some things that God
[1:11:42] won't unlock the faith for until it's
[1:11:44] time. Yeah. Amen. But maybe that's the
[1:11:48] very reason you get into impossible
[1:11:49] situations
[1:11:51] because it's time to unlock the faith.
[1:11:53] Amen.
[1:11:56] That should make us excited. Yeah, that
[1:11:59] should make a dead end super exciting.
[1:12:04] You know, to me, the dead end is so much
[1:12:06] better than the why. It's like, God,
[1:12:09] don't bring me to the Y in the road
[1:12:10] because then I got to wrestle it out.
[1:12:12] And which way do I go this way or that
[1:12:13] way? And is this me or is this God? And
[1:12:15] God, I need a sign. I need And God
[1:12:17] brings us through many W's. And
[1:12:19] sometimes we go down one way and we take
[1:12:20] a U-turn, you know, way down the road
[1:12:22] and come back and realize we made the
[1:12:23] wrong turn on the Y.
[1:12:26] So, the wise to me are a little bit
[1:12:28] complicated. I don't know about you. You
[1:12:31] may have figured them all out.
[1:12:34] But the dead end should be exciting.
[1:12:38] I have no option. I have nowhere to
[1:12:41] turn. I have nothing that I can do.
[1:12:43] There's not a thing in this world I can
[1:12:45] do to change this circumstance. So,
[1:12:47] praise God. God's getting ready to do
[1:12:49] something because my partner hasn't
[1:12:52] quit. He's still my partner.
[1:12:57] As much as your faith will be released,
[1:12:58] that's how much power you can have.
[1:13:00] Because in you dwells the power to make
[1:13:02] heavens and earth, God dwells in you.
[1:13:05] And you are sons and daughters of God.
[1:13:06] Amen. There you are. But it's your
[1:13:08] faith. Jesus said, "According to your
[1:13:10] faith, be it unto you. If thou cast, all
[1:13:12] things are possible. Verily I say unto
[1:13:14] you, if you say unto this mountain, be
[1:13:16] moved and doubt not, but believe that
[1:13:18] what you have said, then what kind of
[1:13:21] people ought we to be, having faith in
[1:13:23] this great redeeming Christ that lives
[1:13:25] in us, this smitten rock that never
[1:13:28] leaves the church. What's in you? Amen.
[1:13:32] What's in you? He says, what's in us is
[1:13:35] this Christ lives us, the smitten
[1:13:37] rock. What is the smitten rock? The
[1:13:40] smitten rock was the rock in the
[1:13:42] wilderness. When they came to a dead
[1:13:43] end, a dry road, they had no water for
[1:13:45] themselves. They were all going to
[1:13:47] perish in the wilderness, them and their
[1:13:48] flocks and their children and everybody.
[1:13:50] Amen. But when there was no option, when
[1:13:52] there was no water source, when there
[1:13:53] was no rain, when there was nothing that
[1:13:55] they can do, there was no dead end for
[1:13:57] God. God knew where to get water where
[1:13:59] there was no water. And the smitten rock
[1:14:02] produced the water. Yeah. Amen. Now,
[1:14:05] what's Christ? Christ is that smitten
[1:14:07] rock cuz that rock spoke of Christ. And
[1:14:09] he was smitten at Calvary. And out from
[1:14:11] him came the water of life. And where is
[1:14:13] that smitten rock? He's in you and he's
[1:14:16] still gushing out water of life.
[1:14:19] There's no dead
[1:14:21] end. Amen. This smitten
[1:14:25] rock never leaves the church. I'm with
[1:14:27] you always, even to the end of the
[1:14:29] world. The everpresence of the great
[1:14:31] gusher of salvation and power that
[1:14:33] poured forth from Calvary into the
[1:14:34] church. the everpresence of the living
[1:14:37] God, great flowing smitten rock that
[1:14:39] goes with us in our journey. So where's
[1:14:43] my sustenance coming from? Where's my
[1:14:45] deliverance coming from? Where's my
[1:14:47] water coming from? From the smitten rock
[1:14:49] in me. Amen. He's the provider of all my
[1:14:52] needs.
[1:14:54] Amen.
[1:14:55] In Romans 12:3, it says, "For I say
[1:14:57] through the grace given unto me to every
[1:14:58] man that is among you, not to think of
[1:15:01] himself more highly than he ought to
[1:15:03] think, but to think soberly according as
[1:15:05] God hath dealt to every man the measure
[1:15:07] of faith." So where does faith come
[1:15:10] from? It comes from him. Amen. He's
[1:15:13] dealt to us our measure of faith. Amen.
[1:15:16] And when God deals to us faith, we need
[1:15:19] to resist thinking and take the road of
[1:15:22] faith. Amen.
[1:15:27] says in the marriage of the lamb, so
[1:15:28] many says, "If the Lord will take this
[1:15:30] evil spirit from me from drinking or
[1:15:32] from gambling or from lying or stealing,
[1:15:34] I'll serve him." But that's up to you.
[1:15:37] See, you got to do something, too. See,
[1:15:40] we talk about having a great partner and
[1:15:42] we're focusing on the partnership with
[1:15:44] God, but this isn't lazy boy
[1:15:46] Christianity.
[1:15:49] This is still partnership with God. This
[1:15:51] is not God will do it. God will fix it.
[1:15:53] God will do it. When God does No,
[1:15:56] there's things for us to do, friends.
[1:15:57] We've got to do our part. When when
[1:15:59] we've come to the end of our part,
[1:16:01] that's when we can rest and trust God.
[1:16:03] But we don't when we haven't tried, when
[1:16:05] we haven't attempted, when we haven't
[1:16:06] given, then just say, "God, you do."
[1:16:10] Wait, it's not going to
[1:16:12] work. So, but that's up to you. See, you
[1:16:14] got to do something, too. They that
[1:16:16] overcome shall inherit all things. They
[1:16:17] that overcome. You have power to do it,
[1:16:20] but you must be willing to lay it down.
[1:16:22] See, uh, she has made herself ready. I
[1:16:25] like that word. You see, God could not
[1:16:27] push us through a pipe. Pull us out on
[1:16:29] the other end. And then saying, "Blessed
[1:16:31] is he that overcomemeth." You had
[1:16:33] nothing to overcome. He just pushed you
[1:16:35] through. But you've got to make
[1:16:37] decisions for yourself. I have to make
[1:16:39] decisions for myself. In doing that, we
[1:16:42] show our faith and respects to God.
[1:16:45] And the reason I put this here is
[1:16:47] because there's times that we get into
[1:16:49] situations, but we know we know that
[1:16:53] we've been spiritually lethargic.
[1:16:56] We've been
[1:16:58] lazy. And then we get into a difficult
[1:17:00] situation. We want God to fix
[1:17:02] everything.
[1:17:04] Listen, that doesn't work.
[1:17:06] God will let us He'll He'll let us do
[1:17:09] our part. God will require that we do
[1:17:12] our part and he'll do his. But when you
[1:17:15] come to that place and you say, "God,
[1:17:17] I've done all that I know to do. God,
[1:17:19] I've done, you know, my heart. You know,
[1:17:22] I could have done better, but I've done
[1:17:24] the best I know how to do. I've done
[1:17:26] what you told me to do in the best way I
[1:17:28] know to do it according to my
[1:17:29] understanding, God. I've done all that I
[1:17:31] know to do, and now I'm at the very end
[1:17:33] of everything that I know what to do,
[1:17:35] know how to do, or have any capacity to
[1:17:38] do. So God, I'm trusting you to do now.
[1:17:42] Amen. When we come to that place, we can
[1:17:44] come to rest because we know we've done
[1:17:46] all that we know to do.
[1:17:50] Amen. If there's still something you can
[1:17:52] do about it, do it. Amen. But if there's
[1:17:56] nothing you can do about it, then don't
[1:17:57] do anything. Trust God.
[1:18:01] Philippians 4:13 says, "I can do all
[1:18:03] things through Christ which strengthenth
[1:18:05] me." Amen.
[1:18:08] Amen. Matthew 19:26. But Jesus beheld
[1:18:11] them and said unto them, "With men, with
[1:18:14] men this is impossible, but with God all
[1:18:18] things are possible." Amen. I don't care
[1:18:21] what the devil has told you is
[1:18:23] impossible. With God all things are
[1:18:26] possible.
[1:18:27] The question is, are you with God and is
[1:18:29] God with you? Then all things are
[1:18:32] possible.
[1:18:34] Amen.
[1:18:37] And the Queen of Sheba, the prophet
[1:18:38] says, "Now instead of advancing on and
[1:18:40] see what God promised, we look back and
[1:18:43] see what some brother behind us says.
[1:18:45] Let's don't look back. Look forward.
[1:18:47] Keep moving on. We have untapped
[1:18:49] resources." I love this word. That's why
[1:18:52] I highlight it. Untapped resources.
[1:18:54] Doesn't matter what you've seen.
[1:18:56] Whatever you've seen and whatever you
[1:18:58] heard is not the limit to God yet. Amen.
[1:19:03] So you think, I've seen so many miracles
[1:19:04] and I I read the supernatural book. That
[1:19:06] doesn't mean that's all that God can do.
[1:19:08] He can do more than even what he did in
[1:19:10] the supernatural book. Amen.
[1:19:13] We have untapped resources. Jesus said
[1:19:16] in St. Mark 11:23, "Whatsoever why if
[1:19:19] you say to this mountain, be moved and
[1:19:21] don't doubt in your heart, but believe
[1:19:23] that what you have said will come to
[1:19:25] pass, you can have what you
[1:19:27] said." Uh no conditions. is it's just
[1:19:31] unlimited. Whatsoever things you desire
[1:19:33] when you pray, believe you receive them.
[1:19:35] You shall have them. Whatever divine
[1:19:37] healing, joy, peace,
[1:19:40] anything. It's amazing when you look at
[1:19:42] the Exodus journey. Amen. When they go
[1:19:44] on the Exodus journey, God had already,
[1:19:47] Amen, in partnership with Moses had
[1:19:49] shown great power and manifestation.
[1:19:51] Amen. Through the through the plagues
[1:19:52] that struck, through the great
[1:19:54] destruction of Egypt. Amen. He had he
[1:19:56] showed through the sign in the hand, the
[1:19:57] sign in the rod, the calling of the of
[1:20:00] all the plagues God had already showed
[1:20:03] in partnership with Moses what power
[1:20:05] that he had. And then he calls them out
[1:20:08] with a mighty hand and he leads them
[1:20:09] down and they come to the Red Sea and
[1:20:12] they come to a dead end. But remember,
[1:20:14] with God there's no dead end. God's ways
[1:20:16] are in the water. That's what he says in
[1:20:19] Psalms. He has ways he has ways in the
[1:20:21] water. Amen. Nobody on the bank knew
[1:20:23] that God had a path under the water. But
[1:20:25] God knew he had a path in the water.
[1:20:29] And he didn't bring him down there to
[1:20:30] destroy him. He brought him down there
[1:20:32] to deliver them.
[1:20:37] And he opened up the Red Sea. And by
[1:20:40] faith they passed through the Red Sea.
[1:20:45] Hey, listen. God was so good. They
[1:20:49] walked on dry ground. All of them. Two
[1:20:51] million. the children, the women, the
[1:20:52] animals, the carts, the everything made
[1:20:55] it through. When they got through the
[1:20:57] other end, the enemy came in and God
[1:20:59] brought the walls of water crashing down
[1:21:01] and drowned all the host of the
[1:21:04] enemy. God had no limit to his power.
[1:21:10] Nature's not a limit. Physics is not a
[1:21:12] limit. Gravity is not a limit. Do you
[1:21:15] know how much water weighs? 8 pounds per
[1:21:18] gallon. How many gallons do you think he
[1:21:20] stood up?
[1:21:23] Amen. If you tried to do it with
[1:21:25] hydraulic rams and steel plates, listen,
[1:21:27] you couldn't build it strong enough to
[1:21:29] lift it. Amen. But God has no struggle
[1:21:32] for God whatsoever because he created
[1:21:34] the world by a spoken word. Listen, they
[1:21:36] go further in the journey. Amen. And all
[1:21:38] of a sudden, they come to water that's
[1:21:40] bitter and they run out of water in
[1:21:41] their flask. They have no water in this
[1:21:43] journey. But God brought them out with a
[1:21:46] mighty hand. God is leading them away.
[1:21:48] God is in partnership with Moses and God
[1:21:51] is in partnership with his people. I'm
[1:21:53] bringing you out and I'm bringing you
[1:21:55] into the land so that you can possess
[1:21:57] the land, the inheritance of your
[1:21:59] fathers.
[1:22:01] This is a walk of partnership. Amen.
[1:22:04] Amen. God's fulfilling his word, but he
[1:22:07] needs people to fulfill it because he
[1:22:09] told Abraham, "Thy seed shall possess
[1:22:11] the land." So in order to get his seed
[1:22:13] to possess the land, he needs the
[1:22:14] partnership with Abraham's seed to
[1:22:16] fulfill the word.
[1:22:19] So then they come to the bitter waters
[1:22:21] and they they say they start to cry out
[1:22:23] against Moses and we can't drink and
[1:22:24] we're all going to die and we never
[1:22:26] should have left Egypt. And God tells
[1:22:28] Moses to go cut a branch off a tree and
[1:22:30] throw it in the water and turn the water
[1:22:32] sweet.
[1:22:34] Who would have known that throwing a
[1:22:37] branch in the water would turn it sweet?
[1:22:40] Only God.
[1:22:42] They went a few more days and they ran
[1:22:44] out of the bread that they had brought.
[1:22:48] And listen, these are just normal
[1:22:51] people. They're just human beings. They
[1:22:54] have to eat to survive. That's the way
[1:22:57] God built our bodies.
[1:22:59] They run out of food and they don't have
[1:23:02] a reaction any different than what our
[1:23:04] reaction would be in the same situation.
[1:23:07] What are we going to do? We have no
[1:23:08] bread. We're in the wilderness. There's
[1:23:10] absolutely no options. Yeah. There's no
[1:23:14] hopping in the car and going to the
[1:23:16] convenience
[1:23:17] store. You can't even go buy overpriced
[1:23:19] chips at Dollar
[1:23:21] General. There's no option.
[1:23:25] And God rains down mana from heaven in
[1:23:28] the morning. They couldn't have
[1:23:30] predicted it. They couldn't have foresaw
[1:23:32] it. They had no idea how God was going
[1:23:34] to solve it. But God knew before the
[1:23:36] foundation of the world. And God knows
[1:23:37] how to bring mana in. Amen. Listen, tell
[1:23:40] me what kind of physics that was.
[1:23:43] I have no idea
[1:23:46] scientifically. How did he do it? I have
[1:23:48] no clue. But the thing is, he had to
[1:23:51] because he already said, "I'm going to
[1:23:53] fulfill my promise. I'm taking you from
[1:23:55] here and I'm bringing you into the
[1:23:57] promised land for you to possess it."
[1:23:59] God, because he partnered himself with
[1:24:01] these people, had no option but to feed
[1:24:03] them when they ran out of food.
[1:24:06] Hallelujah.
[1:24:08] My goodness, you realize that God has
[1:24:11] partnershipped himself with us. And God
[1:24:13] is going to fulfill this end time vision
[1:24:15] of a bride through you and I. And he
[1:24:17] needs us to fulfill his word because he
[1:24:20] promised it'll be in church form. It'll
[1:24:22] be in bride form. And he needs people to
[1:24:24] make up that bride. And because he's
[1:24:26] partnership with us to fulfill his word,
[1:24:28] there's nothing he won't bring us
[1:24:30] through to keep his word. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:33] Then when he comes to the promised land,
[1:24:35] now he says, "Now I've brought you
[1:24:37] through the promised land. Now you go
[1:24:38] possess it. I'll drive them out. I'll go
[1:24:40] with him. Now you possess it." And the
[1:24:42] question is, "Are you going to are you
[1:24:44] going to defeat the enemy or are we
[1:24:46] going to defeat the enemy?" And the
[1:24:47] answer to the question is yes. Because
[1:24:49] it's going to be on partnership again.
[1:24:51] Amen. Said everywhere the the the treads
[1:24:54] of your shoes shall stand. Wherever
[1:24:57] footsteps are possessed, wherever you
[1:24:59] go, I'll give that to you. Hallelujah.
[1:25:01] That's God partnershipped in the first
[1:25:03] exodus. But here we are in the third
[1:25:05] exodus and God's in partnership with you
[1:25:07] and I. Amen.
[1:25:10] He's not going to let you be destroyed.
[1:25:12] He's not going to let you be defeated.
[1:25:14] He's not going to let you come to the
[1:25:16] end without a
[1:25:19] deliverance. Amen. God has a plan for
[1:25:21] our lives. And God is going to manifest
[1:25:23] himself through us. And there's nothing
[1:25:25] that he's allowed that's going to
[1:25:26] destroy us or defeat us or handicap.
[1:25:29] that everything is going to be a
[1:25:31] manifestation of his promise in our
[1:25:33] lives.
[1:25:35] There are no dead ends with God. Amen.
[1:25:40] Hear ye him. He said, "All things are
[1:25:41] possible to them that believe." We've
[1:25:43] got the untapped resources of God on our
[1:25:46] hands to display God. We are sons and
[1:25:49] daughters of God. When God made man, he
[1:25:51] made him a God. He gave him a dominion
[1:25:53] over the earth. But his fallen estate
[1:25:55] dropped that. But what they lost by
[1:25:58] Adam, it was restored by Christ.
[1:26:01] Listen, there's nothing there's nothing
[1:26:04] going to defeat his purpose and his
[1:26:06] bride. When we come to the end of all
[1:26:09] that we can do, that's when it's time to
[1:26:12] hold still and believe.
[1:26:14] That's when it's time to
[1:26:16] expect God to come on the scene. Expect
[1:26:20] something to happen. Amen. That's when
[1:26:22] you
[1:26:23] praying for God to speak.
[1:26:26] That's when you watch everything waiting
[1:26:28] for his deliverance to come. Not with
[1:26:30] despair. What? With hopelessness, but
[1:26:32] all of a sudden with great hope and joy
[1:26:35] because God's just about, you can say it
[1:26:37] this way. God's fixing to do something.
[1:26:41] We've come to the end. I don't see
[1:26:42] another way around or over or under or I
[1:26:45] can't get out of this situation on my
[1:26:46] own. God is fixing to do something,
[1:26:49] friends, because I don't think he's
[1:26:51] finished with me in this life.
[1:26:56] In the revelation of Jesus Christ from
[1:26:57] the church age book, the prophet says,
[1:26:59] "Now remember this, Christ in the true
[1:27:02] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:27:04] Acts. But the book of Revelation shows
[1:27:06] how that the Antichrist spirit would
[1:27:07] come into the church and defile it,
[1:27:10] making it lukewarm, formal, and
[1:27:11] powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing
[1:27:13] his works, which is the attempted
[1:27:15] destruction of God's people and the
[1:27:17] discrediting of God's word." So what is
[1:27:19] the works of the devil? to attempt the
[1:27:21] destruction of God's people and to
[1:27:23] discredit God's word
[1:27:26] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:27:27] the lake of fire. He fights that. He
[1:27:29] cannot stand it. He knows that if the
[1:27:31] people get the true revelation of the
[1:27:33] true church and what she is and what she
[1:27:36] stands for and that she can do the
[1:27:38] greater works, she will be an invincible
[1:27:41] army.
[1:27:43] What does it take to make you an
[1:27:44] invincible army? A revelation of who you
[1:27:48] are. Hallelujah. Of what you are in
[1:27:51] Christ. Not invincible because all of a
[1:27:54] sudden you have all these super duper
[1:27:57] powers as a human being. Invincible
[1:28:00] because none of the ws of the devil can
[1:28:02] trip you up anymore.
[1:28:04] Because how has the devil defeated in
[1:28:07] every age? He's always defeated through
[1:28:10] deception. Amen. Amen. It's always been
[1:28:13] by deception. And now when the deception
[1:28:16] of the enemy is taken away, amen, this
[1:28:19] bride becomes an invincible army because
[1:28:21] she has a revelation of the true
[1:28:23] revelation of the true church and what
[1:28:25] she is. She knows she's a part of God.
[1:28:28] She knows that she's the manifestation
[1:28:29] of Christ. She knows what she is, the
[1:28:32] true revelation of the true
[1:28:34] church and what she stands for and that
[1:28:37] she can do the greater works. She'll be
[1:28:39] an invincible army.
[1:28:42] If they get the true revelation of the
[1:28:44] two spirits within the framework of the
[1:28:46] Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:28:48] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:28:49] spirit, Satan will be powerless before
[1:28:53] her. He will be as definitely thwarted
[1:28:56] today as when Christ withtood his every
[1:28:58] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:28:59] desert. Yes, Satan hates revelation, but
[1:29:03] we love it. With true revelation in our
[1:29:05] lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:29:07] against us, but we will prevail over
[1:29:09] them.
[1:29:12] What an amazing promise for you and I.
[1:29:17] What will make Satan powerless before
[1:29:20] her? Because the power of Satan is in
[1:29:22] deception.
[1:29:24] And when you when Satan can bring so
[1:29:26] many trials, so many difficulties, so
[1:29:29] many circumstances and begin to play in
[1:29:31] your
[1:29:32] mind that you're not bride, you can't be
[1:29:35] one of them, you're forsaken, it's not
[1:29:38] going to work out for you.
[1:29:40] That's his deception, friends. And when
[1:29:43] we start to believe that way and when we
[1:29:45] start to confess those things, we lose.
[1:29:49] Amen. Because God can only operate by
[1:29:52] faith.
[1:29:54] By faith in the word. And the deception
[1:29:57] of the enemy when he starts to take the
[1:29:59] circumstances around you and start to
[1:30:01] label you by the circumstances you're in
[1:30:04] starts to characterize you by the
[1:30:06] difficulties you're facing and starts to
[1:30:08] make you doubt your position and God's
[1:30:11] love for you and the power to deliver
[1:30:13] you and makes your case hopeless and
[1:30:15] makes you at a dead-end road and makes
[1:30:17] you amen it and makes you and and
[1:30:20] hopeless and without hope in all the
[1:30:22] world. Then all of a sudden you lose
[1:30:24] faith. you're not speaking faith. You
[1:30:26] start to speak the very things he's
[1:30:28] putting into your mind and then you're
[1:30:30] defeated.
[1:30:32] But you know what makes him
[1:30:33] powerless? When you can do what Jesus
[1:30:36] did in the wilderness, get thee behind
[1:30:37] me, Satan. I won't accept that. I don't
[1:30:40] believe that. Amen. I know by a
[1:30:42] revelation from God who I am. And it
[1:30:44] doesn't matter what's happening into me.
[1:30:46] What's happening into me doesn't change
[1:30:48] who I am.
[1:30:50] Jesus was led of the spirit into the
[1:30:52] wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
[1:30:53] He had fasted 40 days. He was after the
[1:30:56] fast, he was hungry. Amen. And he was
[1:30:58] tempting him with his physical need. He
[1:31:00] was tempting him with all of these other
[1:31:01] things. But he never left the word and
[1:31:03] he never took the devil's bait. He
[1:31:05] didn't have to prove who he was. He
[1:31:07] didn't have to prove he had power and he
[1:31:08] didn't have to deliver himself. All he
[1:31:10] could do was just give him back the word
[1:31:12] and said, "Get behind me, Satan.
[1:31:15] I'm not going to accept that. Maybe God
[1:31:17] doesn't love you. Please show me that in
[1:31:19] the scripture."
[1:31:22] That's not the message I've received.
[1:31:24] Amen. That's not the revelation he's
[1:31:26] given me. Well, maybe you're just so bad
[1:31:28] or you've been so bad. Come on. You The
[1:31:31] precious blood of Jesus Christ can't
[1:31:32] abolish every sin.
[1:31:35] You've been so bad for so long. That's a
[1:31:38] lie. All lies of the enemy.
[1:31:43] But the truth will set us free. The
[1:31:46] truth will make us free. God chose you.
[1:31:49] Listen, you didn't choose yourself
[1:31:51] because you didn't give yourself a seed
[1:31:53] of predestination. You didn't give
[1:31:54] yourself the ability to believe the
[1:31:56] message that came from God.
[1:32:00] Neither did you give the quickening
[1:32:01] power to quicken that seed to life to
[1:32:04] bring you into the into a relationship
[1:32:07] with Christ. God did that. Amen. It
[1:32:10] doesn't matter where you find yourself
[1:32:12] in the circumstances and the situations
[1:32:15] and the difficulties and the trials.
[1:32:18] Don't let any
[1:32:20] external
[1:32:21] circumstance label you and identify you.
[1:32:26] Go back to the revelation of the word,
[1:32:29] who God told you you were in your soul.
[1:32:32] Amen. And make that your identity. When
[1:32:35] that comes to your identity, you realize
[1:32:36] you're in the third exodus. And in the
[1:32:38] third exodus, you come against a
[1:32:40] barrier. Just hold steady.
[1:32:43] Just hold steady. The barrier will go
[1:32:45] away. Either God will use you to speak
[1:32:48] it or somebody else or something will
[1:32:49] happen or you don't know. I don't know
[1:32:51] how. I'm not trying to predict. All I
[1:32:53] know is this barrier will go away. Amen.
[1:32:56] Because I'm in the third Exodus and what
[1:32:59] he did in the first, he's doing in the
[1:33:00] third. And God bless you all. Let's
[1:33:03] stand
[1:33:05] together. Amen. I don't know about you,
[1:33:07] but I'm so thrilled tonight to have a
[1:33:10] partner. Amen.
[1:33:13] I got a partner who can cover for all my
[1:33:15] lack. Yes, sir. My lack of funds, my
[1:33:17] lack of intelligence, my lack of
[1:33:19] revelation, my lack of character, my my
[1:33:22] lack of determination, my lack of
[1:33:24] willpower. I got a lot of lack in my
[1:33:26] life. Anybody else? Amen. Amen. But we
[1:33:29] got a God who doesn't lack in anything.
[1:33:31] He's got power. He's got might. He's got
[1:33:34] delivering, but he's got a spirit. And
[1:33:36] he hasn't run out of spirit. Amen. He
[1:33:38] can send an anointing. And his anointing
[1:33:40] doesn't get weaker. He's got more
[1:33:42] anointing. If he's anointed in the past,
[1:33:43] he can anoint you again. Amen. Amen. If
[1:33:46] he spoke, if he ever spoke to anybody,
[1:33:49] he can speak to you. Amen. If the spirit
[1:33:52] has ever spoke in anybody's heart, he
[1:33:54] can speak in yours. Amen. Amen. Don't
[1:33:59] Don't come to a dead end.
[1:34:03] When you come to a dead end, just say,
[1:34:04] "This is just a temporary pause in my
[1:34:06] journey forward." Amen. I can't wait to
[1:34:09] see what God does.
[1:34:11] Amen. I'm so happy to have God as a
[1:34:14] partner. Amen. To have Christ as a
[1:34:17] bridegroom, to not be left on my own to
[1:34:19] accomplish these things by myself.
[1:34:22] And because I have such a wonderful
[1:34:24] partner who takes care of me, I want to
[1:34:27] do all I can in this partnership for
[1:34:29] him.
[1:34:32] Paul, the Apostle Paul, found a partner.
[1:34:34] He found a partner that would deliver
[1:34:36] him. found a partner that would forgive
[1:34:38] him. He found a partner that would speak
[1:34:41] through him, show him vision, give him
[1:34:44] revelation. But because he had such a
[1:34:46] wonderful partner in God, Paul wanted to
[1:34:49] give his life as a love slave for
[1:34:51] Christ. And he wanted to do all he can
[1:34:53] in his partnership with God. That's
[1:34:56] where I want to be, friends. I want to
[1:34:58] do all that I can. If he asked me to get
[1:35:01] up in the morning and walk into a
[1:35:03] situation is difficult, I want to go
[1:35:04] there with joy. If that's the least I
[1:35:06] can do for him, I want to go. If I can
[1:35:09] go back into a difficult circumstance,
[1:35:11] if I can walk into a terrible workplace,
[1:35:13] and if that's where God's asked me to
[1:35:14] be, I want to do it. If I can walk a
[1:35:18] little longer with with some
[1:35:19] discouraging things, with some
[1:35:20] difficulties in life, but God wants to
[1:35:22] use that to manifest his glory, then I
[1:35:24] want to be a love slave to Christ. If I
[1:35:26] can get up and if I can walk, I want to
[1:35:27] get up and I want to walk.
[1:35:30] Amen. Amen. On my worst day when I'm
[1:35:34] discouraged and everything's I'm
[1:35:36] everything's falling apart and I feel
[1:35:38] like I'm not even a believer and that
[1:35:40] God can never hear my prayer and
[1:35:42] everything's as bad as it can possibly
[1:35:43] get. If I can just drag myself into the
[1:35:46] car, drive myself to the church and
[1:35:48] stand up and sing a song with my
[1:35:50] brothers and sisters, I'm going to do it
[1:35:52] cuz I'm in partnership with God. And I
[1:35:54] want to be a good partner to God cuz
[1:35:56] he's a good partner to me.
[1:35:59] don't want to be a lazy Christian. I
[1:36:01] don't want to give it all to him. What
[1:36:02] little bit he's asked me to do, I want
[1:36:04] to do it with my whole heart. What
[1:36:07] little bit that's mine to do, I want to
[1:36:08] do it with everything that's in me. And
[1:36:11] that part that I can't, well, praise
[1:36:14] God, I've got a partner.
[1:36:17] Amen. Let's sing. Can we uh sing um
[1:36:21] winds of faith?
[1:36:28] There are two
[1:36:31] roads you may
[1:36:35] take, one by
[1:36:39] side and one by faith.
[1:36:44] Take the word of
[1:36:47] God. For what you
[1:36:51] see, what you
[1:36:55] believe is what will
[1:37:00] be. Set your
[1:37:03] wings to the wings of faith.
[1:37:09] You can
[1:37:11] fly in a higher
[1:37:16] place. Do not
[1:37:20] struggle. It's by
[1:37:24] grace that your
[1:37:27] wings to the winds of
[1:37:32] faith. What you need?
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:37] Watch your
[1:37:41] cry. What surrounds me?
[1:37:45] much to
[1:37:48] learn. Speak the word of
[1:37:52] God and by and
[1:38:00] by
[1:38:04] you. Set your
[1:38:07] wings to the winds of
[1:38:12] pain. You can
[1:38:16] find a higher
[1:38:20] place. Do not
[1:38:24] struggle. It's by
[1:38:28] grace that
[1:38:31] your
[1:38:34] to watch the bride. Watch the
[1:38:39] cry in this end
[1:38:43] time. She does not
[1:38:47] struggle. She does not
[1:38:52] shine. For the
[1:38:55] power that will make her
[1:39:00] rise is
[1:39:04] already down inside.
[1:39:09] Set your
[1:39:11] wings to the winds of
[1:39:15] f. You can
[1:39:19] fly in a higher
[1:39:23] place. Do not struggle.
[1:39:28] It's by
[1:39:31] grace that
[1:39:35] you
[1:39:39] to Amen. No matter what you're dealing
[1:39:45] with, you might have obstacles that you
[1:39:49] can't
[1:39:51] bypass, but I want you to start to
[1:39:54] envision them as chicken wire. Amen.
[1:39:58] Yes.
[1:40:00] Because the only limit is the limit in
[1:40:02] our mind.
[1:40:04] Just because we can't see a way around
[1:40:08] it or a way over it or a way through it
[1:40:10] doesn't mean there isn't one.
[1:40:13] That eagle all his life would bump
[1:40:16] against the chicken wire fence and that
[1:40:18] was as far as he could go. all of his
[1:40:21] life, however long it was, his entire
[1:40:24] life, he would walk and he would hit the
[1:40:26] north side, the east side, the west
[1:40:28] side, and no matter what he tried,
[1:40:30] there's no getting through
[1:40:33] it. But one
[1:40:35] day, in a moment of time, a heavenly
[1:40:40] scream changed
[1:40:42] everything. Amen. It doesn't matter how
[1:40:44] long you've bumped against the chicken
[1:40:46] wire.
[1:40:47] You can have a damaged relationship with
[1:40:50] a family member and you hit the chicken
[1:40:53] wire. Listen, all it takes is a scream
[1:40:55] from heaven. One moment can change
[1:40:57] everything. Amen. You can have
[1:40:59] difficulty in your marriage and you
[1:41:00] think it's been this way 25 years, 30
[1:41:02] years. It'll always be that. It won't
[1:41:04] always be that way. There's no such
[1:41:06] thing as a dead-end road. Amen. A
[1:41:08] difficulty with a relationship with your
[1:41:10] child, with a spouse, with somebody
[1:41:12] else. Don't ever don't ever don't ever
[1:41:16] give up hope. Amen. Don't ever stop
[1:41:18] believing because listen, if you're in a
[1:41:21] marriage that's hit a dead end and going
[1:41:23] nowhere, if you don't believe, who will?
[1:41:26] Amen.
[1:41:29] If you've got a relationship with a
[1:41:30] child that's broken and they and it
[1:41:32] needs to be restored and they need to
[1:41:34] come to the Lord, if you quit believing,
[1:41:36] who's going to believe? God needs
[1:41:38] somebody to believe his word.
[1:41:41] God needs somebody to have faith that
[1:41:43] it's not impossible, that it's not over,
[1:41:45] that the story's not finished yet,
[1:41:47] there's no period at the end of this.
[1:41:51] All this is is chicken
[1:41:54] wire. Amen. It only has me bound because
[1:41:58] there's things I don't yet understand.
[1:42:00] It's only a barrier because I haven't
[1:42:03] yet heard the scream that gets me over
[1:42:05] it.
[1:42:07] But it's not a limit to God. It's only a
[1:42:10] temporary limit to
[1:42:12] me. It won't last. It won't
[1:42:16] stand. Remember, whatever situation you
[1:42:18] find yourself in, if you stop
[1:42:21] believing, how will deliverance come? If
[1:42:25] you give up, you're the one in the
[1:42:28] situation. You're the one who has to
[1:42:32] believe. Don't let a little chicken wire
[1:42:35] cause you to lose heart.
[1:42:37] It's just a hop, skip, and a jump at the
[1:42:39] right time. And that chicken wire is no
[1:42:41] barrier at
[1:42:43] all. We got to stop making things big.
[1:42:47] They're not
[1:42:48] big. We got to stop making problems
[1:42:50] insurmountable. We have to stop making
[1:42:52] things, you know,
[1:42:54] colossal. You're only thinking that way
[1:42:57] because we're thinking from an earthly
[1:43:00] perspective. But from a heavenly
[1:43:02] perspective, it's not colossal. It's
[1:43:04] tiny.
[1:43:06] The problem that's big to you is tiny to
[1:43:09] your partner.
[1:43:11] And the part that you need supernatural
[1:43:13] deliverance for for God, it's not
[1:43:15] supernatural. It's just normal. Amen.
[1:43:17] Cuz God's not supernatural. What we call
[1:43:19] supernatural is God's everyday life.
[1:43:21] Amen. To supernatural to him is normal.
[1:43:25] Yeah. So if you need supernatural, well,
[1:43:27] praise God. To our partner, that's
[1:43:29] normal. Yeah. Amen. So don't give up.
[1:43:33] Don't stop believing. Don't
[1:43:36] quit because God will remove every
[1:43:39] barrier. Whether it's a red sea, a piece
[1:43:41] of chicken wire, or whatever it
[1:43:44] is, God has the solution. Keep
[1:43:48] believing, keep moving, keep pressing,
[1:43:51] keep doing all that you can do and then
[1:43:55] believe your partner to do the part you
[1:43:57] can't do. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[1:43:59] together and pray.
[1:44:02] Dear heavenly father, we thank you
[1:44:04] God. I thank you so much, Lord, that I
[1:44:07] know I don't have to walk this journey
[1:44:09] all by myself. Lord, you've never asked
[1:44:12] me to be a Christian and follow your
[1:44:14] word and manifest your life on my own.
[1:44:18] But God, you've promised to be with me
[1:44:19] and even in me, to empower me by your
[1:44:22] spirit, to anoint me with your
[1:44:24] anointing, to give me revelation and
[1:44:26] vision and understanding. And God, I'm
[1:44:29] so thankful I can put my trust in
[1:44:32] you. God, I pray you'd help us all to do
[1:44:35] our part faithfully. Lord, we want to be
[1:44:37] faithful to
[1:44:38] you. But God, we've all got places that
[1:44:41] we need help. Lord, we've all got areas
[1:44:44] that we don't have
[1:44:47] enough. But God, we're trusting in you.
[1:44:50] We're trusting in you to fill in the
[1:44:52] gaps, to give the power, to give the
[1:44:54] strength, to give the deliverance. And
[1:44:56] Lord, would you quicken to us a greater
[1:44:58] faith, Lord, greater vision, greater
[1:45:01] revelation than we've ever had. God, may
[1:45:04] there be many people, Lord, here tonight
[1:45:06] that have been in a dead end. May they
[1:45:08] realize there's no dead end. God, if
[1:45:10] there's someone here who believe they
[1:45:12] were at the end of the rope, God, I pray
[1:45:13] you'd show them there's plenty of rope.
[1:45:16] God, if there's any of us who've been
[1:45:18] hitting the chicken wire all of our
[1:45:20] life, God, would you change our
[1:45:22] perspective and help us to realize this
[1:45:24] is no real
[1:45:25] barrier. It's only temporary. It's only
[1:45:29] carnal and it can't hold
[1:45:32] us. Oh God, I pray you'd bring the
[1:45:34] realization of the truth to our lives.
[1:45:38] Not the false, not the carnal, but the
[1:45:41] reality. May it become everything to us.
[1:45:44] Bless your people, Lord. give them
[1:45:46] deliverance. Speak to them, Lord,
[1:45:47] through your word. And I pray you'd make
[1:45:49] the words that were spoke tonight become
[1:45:51] a a living manifestation in the lives of
[1:45:54] your children. You've done it so many
[1:45:56] times in our past, Lord. May it come to
[1:45:58] us now again and again, Lord. And may
[1:46:00] you show yourself mighty and powerful
[1:46:02] and able to conquer in our lives. For
[1:46:06] we're putting our faith and trust in
[1:46:07] you. Bless your people as we part. We
[1:46:10] pray. God, be with each one. In Jesus
[1:46:13] Christ's name we pray.
[1:46:16] Amen.
[1:46:18] Amen. There are two
[1:46:22] roads you may
[1:46:26] take, one by
[1:46:29] side and one by
[1:46:33] faith. Take the word of God.
[1:46:38] What you
[1:46:40] see, what you
[1:46:44] believe is what will
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:48] be. Set your
[1:46:51] wings to the winds of
[1:46:55] faith. You can
[1:46:59] fly in a higher
[1:47:03] place. Do not struggle.
[1:47:08] It's by
[1:47:11] grace that you
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:14] reach to the winds of
[1:47:18] faith. What's your
[1:47:22] need? What's your
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:26] cry? What's your
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:29] mountain with much to hide?
[1:47:34] Speak the word of
[1:47:37] God. By and
[1:47:41] by
[1:47:44] it, for you will
[1:47:48] fly. Set your
[1:47:52] wings to the winds of
[1:47:56] pain. You can
[1:47:59] fly in a higher place.
[1:48:04] Do not
[1:48:07] struggle. It's by
[1:48:11] grace that your
[1:48:14] wings to the winds of me. Watch the
[1:48:18] eagle. Watch the
[1:48:22] eagle in the
[1:48:25] sky. He does not
[1:48:29] struggle. He does not struggle.
[1:48:35] All the
[1:48:37] power that makes him
[1:48:41] rise is
[1:48:44] already in the
[1:48:48] sky. Set your
[1:48:51] wings to the winds of
[1:48:55] faith. You can
[1:48:58] fly in a higher place.
[1:49:04] Do not
[1:49:06] struggle. It's by
[1:49:10] grace that you
[1:49:13] waste to the winds of
[1:49:17] faith and watch the
[1:49:21] bride in this end
[1:49:25] time. She does not struggle.
[1:49:29] She does not
[1:49:32] strive for the
[1:49:36] power that will make her
[1:49:40] rise is
[1:49:44] already down in
[1:49:47] time. So set your
[1:49:50] wings to the wings of faith.
[1:49:56] You can
[1:49:58] fly in a higher
[1:50:02] place. Do not
[1:50:06] struggle. It's by
[1:50:09] grace. Set your
[1:50:13] wings to the winds of faith. Set your
[1:50:17] wings. Set your
[1:50:20] wings to the winds of faith.

[1:50:28] fly in a higher
[1:50:32] place. Do not
[1:50:35] struggle. It's by
[1:50:39] grace set your
[1:50:42] way to the winds of
[1:50:46] faith. F.
[1:50:50] God will make a
[1:50:54] way where there seems to be no
[1:51:00] way. He works in ways we cannot
[1:51:05] see. He will make a way for
[1:51:11] me. He will be my
[1:51:15] God. Hold me closely to his side.
[1:51:22] with love and strength for each new
[1:51:26] day. He will make a
[1:51:31] way. He will make a way once more. God
[1:51:37] will make a
[1:51:40] way where there seems to be no way.
[1:51:46] He works in ways he cannot
[1:51:50] see. He will make a way for
[1:51:55] me. He will be my
[1:51:59] God. Hold me closely to his
[1:52:04] son with love and strength for each new
[1:52:09] day. He will make a way.
[1:52:14] He will make a way once more. God will

[1:52:27] way. He works in ways and we cannot see.
[1:52:33] He will make a way for me. He will be my
[1:52:39] God.
[1:52:41] Hold me closely to his
[1:52:45] son. Love and strength for each new day.
[1:52:51] He will make a
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:54] way. He will make a
[1:53:01] way. I
[1:53:03] surrender it all.
[1:53:07] All I
[1:53:09] surrender it
[1:53:15] all. Whatever it is in my life that is a
[1:53:22] big hindrance.

[1:54:55] Oh, I
[1:54:57] surrender it all.
[1:55:01] [Music]
[1:55:03] I
[1:55:04] surrender it
[1:55:09] all. Whatever it is in my life that is a
[1:55:16] big hand
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:23] riser it all.

[1:55:54] Oh, draw me
[1:55:56] [Music]
[1:55:59] nearer, near, blessed Lord, to the cross
[1:56:05] where thou hast
[1:56:10] died. Draw me

[1:56:20] Lord to thy

[1:56:25] leading
[1:56:28] son. I am thine, oh Lord. I have heard
[1:56:35] thy voice and it
[1:56:39] told thy love to me.
[1:56:45] But I long to rise in the arms of faith
[1:56:53] and be
[1:56:54] closer
[1:56:55] drawn to
[1:56:59] thee. Draw me

[1:57:23] Lord, to thy
[1:57:26] preious
[1:57:28] bleeding son.
[1:57:33] Consecrate me now to thy
[1:57:38] service, Lord, by the
[1:57:41] power of grace divine.
[1:57:47] Let my soul look up with a
[1:57:52] steadfast hope and my will be lost in
[1:58:01] thine. Draw me
[1:58:03] nearer,
[1:58:05] nearer, nearer,
[1:58:08] blessedly to the cross where thou hast
[1:58:14] died.
[1:58:16] Draw me
[1:58:18] nearer,
[1:58:20] nearer, nearer, blessed
[1:58:25] Lord, to thy
[1:58:28] preious
[1:58:29] bleeding side.
[1:58:33] Oh, the pure
[1:58:36] delight of a
[1:58:39] single l that
[1:58:42] before thy throne I
[1:58:47] spend. When I kneel in prayer and with
[1:58:52] thee, my God, I commune as
[1:58:58] friend with friend.
[1:59:03] Draw me
[1:59:04] nearer,
[1:59:06] nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord, to the
[1:59:11] cross where thou hast
[1:59:16] died. Draw me
[1:59:19] nearer,
[1:59:21] nearer, nearer. Blessed
[1:59:25] Lord to thy
[1:59:29] preious
[1:59:30] leading
[1:59:33] side. There are depths of love that I
[1:59:39] cannot know till I cross the
[1:59:45] narrow sea.
[1:59:49] There are heights of joy that I may not
[1:59:55] reach till I rest in
[1:59:59] peace with
[2:00:02] thee. Draw me
[2:00:04] [Music]
[2:00:04] [Applause]
[2:00:07] near, near, blessed Lord, to the
[2:00:12] cross where thou hast died.
[2:00:18] Draw me
[2:00:19] nearer,
[2:00:21] nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord.
