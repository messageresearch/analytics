[18:31] really blessed it was those of you who
[18:33] were there you know it was quite a
[18:35] blessing and uh brother Ron ministered I
[18:37] don't know if all of you know I think I
[18:38] said something Wednesday but brother Ron
[18:40] ministered and couldn't imagine how
[18:42] difficult that was but he did a
[18:44] fantastic job and I appreciate what he
[18:45] say brother Ron and one thing that he
[18:47] said that really struck me and my wife

[18:51] brother Ron said I can't preach Judy
[18:53] garvin's funeral she already preached it
[18:56] and the way she lived and that had a lot
[18:58] of impact on me and then it makes you
[19:00] think what kind of sermon am I preaching
[19:03] for my funeral right now amen so it had
[19:05] a lot of impact on us and he and his
[19:07] brother spoke and his sister-in-law and
[19:09] a brother-in-law they all did a
[19:10] fantastic job and I I left encouraged
[19:12] and even some of the things that they
[19:14] were sharing uh from Sister Judy's uh
[19:17] prayer journal and Thanksgiving Journal
[19:19] were things that were on my heart for
[19:21] today so I was feeding and enjoying even

[19:30] family in prayer anden let's all Stand
[19:35] Together amen I have an interesting
[19:37] title today and I don't want it to scare
[19:39] you so it's just it might be scary at
[19:42] first but I want to preach on the church
[19:43] in trouble the church in trouble amen
[19:47] and this really this came from a
[19:50] conversation that I had I had a
[19:52] conversation with a a minister from
[19:54] overseas he had was going through some
[19:57] distressing things in the ministry and
[19:59] some things that he didn't understand
[20:00] and him and I were just fellowshipping
[20:02] and and as we were talking these were
[20:04] some of the things we were talking on
[20:06] and it was it was really uh edifying for
[20:08] me as well and and so I just wanted to
[20:11] share some of the the highlights from
[20:12] that conversation with you all because I
[20:14] found it to be quite a blessing so if
[20:17] you want to turn with me to Matthew
[20:18] let's turn to Matthew chapter
[20:22] 10 and we'll begin reading from Matthew
[20:24] chapter 10
[20:34] Matthew chapter
[20:36] 10 verse
[20:41] 16 Jesus says to his disciples behold I
[20:44] send you forth as sheep in the midst of
[20:46] wolves be therefore wise as serpents and
[20:49] harmless as doves but beware of men for
[20:52] they will deliver you up to the councils
[20:54] and they will scorge you in their
[20:55] synagogues and you shall be brought
[20:57] before Governors and Kings for my sake
[20:59] for a testimony against them and the
[21:02] Gentiles but when they deliver you up
[21:05] take no thought how or what you shall
[21:07] speak for shall be given you in that
[21:09] same hour what you shall speak for it is
[21:11] not ye that speak but the spirit of your
[21:13] father which speaketh in you and the
[21:15] brother shall deliver up the brother to
[21:17] death and the Father the child and the
[21:19] children shall rise up against their
[21:21] parents and cause them to be put to
[21:23] death and you shall be hated of all men
[21:25] for my name's sake but he that endureth
[21:28] to the end shall be saved amen God bless
[21:32] you as you take your
[21:33] seats amen I can't imagine being one of
[21:37] the 12
[21:39] disciples and being caught up in the in
[21:43] the great things that were happening
[21:44] around Jesus and the great ministry that
[21:46] was taking place and uh the Dynamics of
[21:49] the healings and the Miracles and the
[21:51] signs and the Wonders and all the things
[21:54] that were so tremendous and to come to
[21:56] this place where Jesus starts to instru
[21:58] his disciples and and I can't imagine it
[22:02] being anything but
[22:04] discouraging can you imagine somebody
[22:06] sitting you down and say listen this is
[22:07] going to happen listen they're going to
[22:09] hate you for my name's sake brother's
[22:11] going to rise up against brother and
[22:13] father against son and child against
[22:15] mother and all of these things are going
[22:17] to happen amen and they're going to
[22:20] imprison you and they're going to scorge
[22:21] you and they're going to do all of these
[22:22] things to you and I I just I just myself
[22:25] personally can't imagine what it would
[22:27] be like to sit there no wonder they had
[22:29] doubts when they watched The Miracles
[22:30] and the healings and everything that was
[22:32] taking place and they're like surely
[22:34] this can't be what's happening next but
[22:36] surely that was going to be what
[22:37] happened
[22:38] next but Jesus says but he that endureth
[22:42] to the end shall be saved so he's
[22:46] telling the disciples ahead of time that
[22:49] there is a walk coming that's going to
[22:51] require
[22:52] endurance this word endurance is the
[22:54] same word as patience so patience and
[22:58] endurance the same thing that there's
[23:00] going to the the Christian Life Is A
[23:02] Life That's going to require endurance
[23:04] anden we're going to have to endure unto
[23:07] the end and they that endureth to the
[23:09] end shall be
[23:10] saved
[23:12] um when Jesus says this it also by
[23:16] making the statement he also alludes to
[23:19] the fact that there will be those who do
[23:20] not endure to the
[23:22] end because he says those that endure to
[23:24] the end shall be saved if everybody
[23:26] would endure to the end he wouldn't have
[23:28] made the St statement the way he did so
[23:30] it shows that they wouldn't so when when
[23:32] I take the title of the church in
[23:34] trouble I I just I I don't get nervous
[23:37] but the reality is the church has always
[23:39] been right in the middle of trouble
[23:41] always has been always will be amen
[23:44] because it's the testing ground it's The
[23:46] Proving Ground it's what God uses to
[23:48] manifest his own nature and his own
[23:50] character and the message is your life
[23:52] worthy of the Gospel he says now let's
[23:55] watch look at Jesus just for a minute he
[23:58] was your your example I hope you're not
[23:59] getting too tired now look let's look at
[24:01] Jesus just a minute he was our example
[24:04] for I have given you an example that you
[24:05] should do to others as I have done to
[24:07] you now watch when he came into the
[24:09] world when there was more as much
[24:11] unbelief in the world right then as
[24:13] there ever was it didn't even slow him
[24:16] up he went right on preaching just the
[24:18] same and healing just the same never
[24:21] bothered him there was critics the man
[24:23] was criticized from the time he was a
[24:25] baby until he died on the cross did it
[24:27] stop him no sir what was his goal always
[24:31] do that which the father has written
[24:33] always do that which pleaseth him so
[24:36] brother R showing us now in the Life
[24:38] worthy of the Gospel that this is our
[24:40] example that that that the world Jesus
[24:43] was in had just as much unbelief if
[24:45] there ever was we can't say there's more
[24:47] unbelief now there's there's a mass
[24:49] amounts of unbelief but Jesus faced
[24:51] massive amounts of
[24:52] unbelief he was criticized from the time
[24:55] he was a baby he was accused of
[24:57] everything he was was accused of being
[24:59] born out of wedlock he is accused of
[25:01] being a bastard child he was accused of
[25:03] having a devil he was accused of having
[25:05] strange doctrines and and all of these
[25:07] things so he was misunderstood he was
[25:10] accused he was criticized uh uh in his
[25:13] lifetime he was forsaken he was betrayed
[25:15] he he he went through all of these
[25:17] things but brother Brenham said it never
[25:20] phased him it never bothered him oh my
[25:24] goodness I wish I could get to that
[25:26] place where nothing would bother me amen
[25:28] it's going to take a whole lot more
[25:29] grace because this cck bur nature I me I
[25:31] get bothered by a whole lot of things
[25:33] that NE bothered him and I don't think
[25:36] that it never bothered him ever that he
[25:38] was never troubled because we know that
[25:39] he was grieved amen when the Rich Young
[25:41] Ruler walked away we know that he was
[25:43] grieved when the disciples had not Faith
[25:45] amen we know that there was things that
[25:46] bothered him but it never bothered him
[25:48] in a way of deterring him it never
[25:51] bothered him away from his purpose from
[25:53] the objective from the goal amen he was
[25:56] steadfast Amen in doing what he was put
[25:59] on Earth to do regardless of the
[26:01] opposition criticism or whatever he had
[26:03] to
[26:04] face he he says there what was his goal
[26:08] always do that which the father has
[26:10] written always do which pleaseth pleased
[26:13] him let's uh go over to Hebrews chapter
[26:22] 12 I'm going to give you a few
[26:24] scriptures here and then uh share with
[26:26] you some of what we were discussing in
[26:28] our conversation with the
[26:37] brother Hebrews
[26:42] 12:1 says wherefore seeing we also are
[26:45] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[26:46] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[26:49] and the sin which does so easily beset
[26:50] us and let us run with patience the race
[26:53] that is set before us patience can also
[26:55] be swapped out with
[26:57] endurance same thing we got to
[27:00] endure
[27:02] [Music]
[27:03] so he said because we have so great a
[27:06] cloud of witnesses what is the cloud of
[27:07] witnesses what he just read in Hebrews
[27:10] 12 all the heroes of the faith those
[27:12] that through persecution and trial and
[27:15] in the face of great opposition they all
[27:17] held their faith and believed the word
[27:18] of God for their day and he's saying
[27:20] because of that let us lay aside every
[27:22] weight and the sin which does so easily
[27:24] beset us and let us run with patience
[27:26] the race that is set before us
[27:28] looking unto Jesus the author and finish
[27:31] of our faith who for the joy which was
[27:33] set before him endured the cross
[27:36] despising the shame and is sat down at
[27:38] the right hand of the Throne of God for
[27:41] consider him that endured such
[27:42] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[27:45] lest you be wearied and faint in your
[27:47] minds ye have not yet resisted unto
[27:49] blood striving against sin so he is our
[27:53] example but we he's telling us Let Jesus
[27:57] be our example but yet we have not
[27:59] striven to blood I mean we have not we
[28:02] have not been driven in the blood
[28:03] striving against sin we have never had
[28:06] amen we have never had to endure like he
[28:08] had to endure we never had to keep
[28:10] pressing like he had to keep pressing
[28:12] amen so let him be our example and all
[28:14] things so as he's our example I want to
[28:17] go back and go back to verse two and I
[28:19] want to catch something from the mindset
[28:21] of Jesus and in verse two it says
[28:24] looking unto Jesus the author and finish
[28:26] of our faith so Jesus is the author
[28:28] author of our faith he's the one who has
[28:30] actually given us our faith or written
[28:31] our faith and he's the finisher of our
[28:33] faith so it's not our faith it's his
[28:36] faith that he's written in our hearts
[28:38] amen and he's the finisher of that Faith
[28:41] now let's look
[28:43] again who for the joy that was set
[28:46] before him endured the
[28:50] cross despising the
[28:52] shame and sat down at the right hand of
[28:55] the Throne of God so when we look at the
[28:59] cross the cross wasn't a light trivial
[29:01] thing amen he despised the shame of it
[29:04] the rejection the being stripped neaked
[29:06] to be spit upon to be to be mocked and
[29:08] scored and and hung up like a common
[29:10] criminal amen he
[29:13] despised the
[29:15] shame but what caused him to walk on
[29:19] Amen into that shame that he
[29:22] despised what was it when he was in The
[29:24] Garden of Gethsemane there was something
[29:26] he wanted to bypass and that was C that
[29:29] was the cross he said father if there's
[29:30] any way for this cup to pass me let it
[29:32] pass me and Thrice he asked him and
[29:34] every time he said but not my will thine
[29:36] I want to do your will but is there any
[29:38] way in your will that I can bypass this
[29:40] because he was despising the
[29:42] shame but what caused him to be able to
[29:45] walk forward into what he despised and
[29:48] didn't want and asked to bypass it was
[29:50] the joy that laid ahead amen he had a
[29:52] vision that went beyond the trial he had
[29:55] a vision and an understanding that went
[29:57] beyond the circumstance ances he was
[29:59] looking to the glory that lay ahead he
[30:01] was looking to the joy that lay ahead he
[30:03] was looking to what Redemption would
[30:05] bring the fullness of redemption when
[30:07] you and I and he would and all the
[30:08] children of God would be collected back
[30:10] upon the Earth in a restored Eden amen
[30:13] and the glory that God wanted from the
[30:15] beginning in his mind now established
[30:17] upon the Earth and he could look at that
[30:19] joy and because of that Joy he can
[30:22] endure the
[30:23] cross oh we've been given a message amen
[30:26] that takes the veil off the book so that
[30:28] we can look to the same thing he was
[30:30] looking at amen we could set our focus
[30:33] on the same thing Jesus was looking at
[30:35] amen because we now know what was the
[30:37] mystery in the back of God's mind what
[30:39] he wanted to do and what he wanted to do
[30:41] was restore Eden he wanted to bring back
[30:44] Adam and he wanted to bring back the
[30:45] woman and he wanted to restore them back
[30:47] in rulership on a perfect Earth that was
[30:49] in harmony under the subjection of the
[30:51] Son of God Amen and God revealed that
[30:54] mystery unto us and now we
[30:58] [Music]
[30:59] amen we can look to the same Joy Jesus
[31:03] was looking
[31:05] to and if we can look to the same Joy
[31:07] Jesus can look to can we endure our
[31:10] cross cuz remember Jesus told them amen
[31:13] If any man come after me let him deny
[31:15] himself and take up his
[31:18] cross and follow
[31:21] me oh man how many gths prayers have we
[31:24] prayed I mean I don't know about you but
[31:27] I've prayed a lot Lord please don't let
[31:29] this happen please Lord let me bypass
[31:32] this trial let me skip around it somehow
[31:35] or are you come and just wipe it off and
[31:37] make it go away so that I don't have to
[31:38] walk what it looks like I'm having to
[31:40] walk
[31:41] into but can we say but not my will thy
[31:44] will be done and can we what what gives
[31:48] us the courage to step forward into
[31:50] something that that could be painful or
[31:52] difficult or or hard to understand amen
[31:55] it's got to be the joy that lays ahead
[32:03] brother Bram says in the message God has
[32:05] provided the lamb he says but you know
[32:07] he was headed for Jerusalem going up to
[32:09] be
[32:10] crucified all the sins of the world was
[32:12] upon him and he was going to Jerusalem
[32:14] to be offered up as a sacrifice and they
[32:18] mocked and made fun of him and some of
[32:20] them blessed him and some of them cursed
[32:22] him just like there is in practically
[32:25] every meeting where he is at some is for
[32:27] him some is against him but he never
[32:30] seemed to bother him he had his face set
[32:33] toward finishing his
[32:35] course and on he walked steadily as he
[32:38] went on looking towards Jerusalem and 12
[32:40] little men had him Garrison there trying
[32:41] to hold the crowds back and some trying
[32:44] to touch him and some screaming and
[32:46] making fun of him and so forth brother M
[32:49] tells us wherever Jesus is there's a lot
[32:51] of
[32:52] noise he says wherever Jesus was there
[32:55] was always this mixed multitude we we'll
[32:58] read some quotes later that where he
[32:59] says this there was some for him some
[33:02] against him and some who didn't
[33:04] understand and didn't know were confused
[33:05] about what was going on and wherever
[33:07] Jesus was there was always this
[33:11] noise well the question is if Jesus is
[33:14] in our midst what do we
[33:16] expect what should our expectation be I
[33:20] find so many times that we wind up in
[33:23] this journey of life and in our
[33:24] Christian walk we wind up disappointed
[33:27] amen and the only way that we can be
[33:29] disappointed is when something doesn't
[33:31] meet our
[33:32] expectations that's the only way we can
[33:34] have a disappointment if I expected one
[33:36] thing and I received something than I
[33:38] than I expected then I'm
[33:42] disappointed but if my expectation is
[33:45] met there's no
[33:48] disappointment right so Jesus gave his
[33:51] disciples the correct
[33:54] expectation in this life you shall have
[33:56] tribulation yeah
[33:59] you will be hated by all men for my
[34:01] name's sake you know brother against
[34:03] brother and father and all of these
[34:04] things you'll be scor and and Jesus was
[34:07] trying he was trying to set the right
[34:10] expectation so when they come into this
[34:13] this trouble there would be no
[34:18] disappointment but guess what happened
[34:19] many of them were
[34:21] disappointed and discouraged amen and
[34:23] walked away amen because they expected
[34:26] brother BR says
[34:28] we expect Christianity to be a flowery
[34:30] bed of ease but it was never intended to
[34:32] be a flowery bed of EAS Jesus never said
[34:34] it would be none of the Apostles ever
[34:36] said it would be we were never told in
[34:38] the scripture that this was going to be
[34:39] smooth sailing and we never were told
[34:41] that coming to the message all of a
[34:42] sudden would erase all problems amen and
[34:44] there would no be no more trials and
[34:46] there would be no more noise Around
[34:51] Jesus right but there's many times that
[34:53] we get
[34:55] disappointed because of our expectation
[34:59] so I just want to have a Biblical
[35:03] expectation amen because we're going to
[35:06] have according to the scripture we're
[35:08] going to have to endure to the
[35:10] end and in order to endure to the end
[35:13] I'm going to take Jesus as my example in
[35:15] order to endure to the end I've got to
[35:17] have something to fasten my eyes on
[35:20] other than the trials of life I've got
[35:22] to have something to fix my Gaze on
[35:24] other than the trouble that surround the
[35:26] Church of God we've got to set our eyes
[35:29] on something else amen so that so that
[35:31] we don't get disappointed because I'm
[35:34] pressing towards the mark of the High
[35:35] Calling of Christ Jesus I'm moving
[35:37] towards the goal amen and these all of
[35:40] these things amen are things that are
[35:42] necessary to shape to mold to manifest
[35:45] to to do whatever God wants to do he
[35:47] told us they would be here brother B
[35:48] said they will be
[35:50] here Jesus said they will be
[35:53] here amen if you turn with me to John
[36:03] 666 just a different way of saying that
[36:06] John chap 6: 66 so turn with me to John
[36:20] 666 in John chapter 6 verse
[36:26] 66 from that time many of his disciples
[36:28] went back and walked no more with
[36:31] him we've been talking about this for a
[36:34] uh some time for the last several times
[36:36] we ministered we've been on the same
[36:38] theme but they were hearing hard sayings
[36:42] that they didn't comprehend and things
[36:44] that were hard to reconcile like Jesus
[36:46] telling them to eat his flesh and to
[36:48] drink his
[36:49] blood or to make it more difficult that
[36:53] if you see the son of man come from
[36:55] where he was before and and who was in
[36:58] heaven and it's just so things that the
[37:01] natural mind did not comprehend and they
[37:03] couldn't comprehend and didn't match
[37:05] what they understood and what they had
[37:07] been taught in the Bible and because of
[37:10] this contradiction they couldn't
[37:11] reconcile in their minds and it was a
[37:13] hard saying they said this is a hard
[37:16] saying who can hear it and after they
[37:18] said that Jesus made it more difficult
[37:20] by saying but what and if you see the
[37:21] son of man Ascend where he come down
[37:23] from and and then they they don't
[37:25] understand it and because of that they
[37:27] walked
[37:30] away
[37:34] and and then Jesus verse 67 then said
[37:38] Jesus unto the twel will you also go
[37:41] away then Simon Peter answered him Lord
[37:43] to whom shall we go thou Hast the words
[37:46] of eternal life and we believe and are
[37:48] sure that thou art that Christ the son
[37:50] of the Living God Jesus answered them
[37:53] have not I chosen you 12 and one of you
[37:56] is a devil
[37:59] this is interesting to
[38:01] me in Jesus's
[38:06] Ministry he would
[38:08] call 12
[38:11] disciples and one of them was a
[38:14] devil and that devil would be embedded
[38:18] like a disciple it'd be a chosen
[38:19] disciple embedded like a brother and
[38:22] Jesus wouldn't trust him with the money
[38:25] bag would give him
[38:28] power and authority and he would give
[38:30] him the power to cast out Devils he give
[38:34] him the power to heal the lame give the
[38:36] power to cleanse
[38:38] lepers and he also sent 70 out two by
[38:42] two so he would commission them with a
[38:44] Ministry to go and preach the that the
[38:47] Kingdom of Heaven is near and and they
[38:50] went out commissioned by Jesus himself
[38:52] so if we look at it this way this was
[38:55] Jesus's Church
[38:57] if we could just this is Jesus's church
[39:01] and in his church he has 70 select
[39:04] ministers brother Ram said the
[39:05] Ministerial
[39:07] Association that he has fellowship with
[39:09] and he has confidence in and he sends
[39:11] them out two by two to go preaching and
[39:14] so if they would go out preaching two by
[39:17] two they would say they could say to
[39:19] everybody Jesus sent me personally to
[39:22] come preach that right and he selected
[39:25] me and called me and he sent me to go
[39:27] represent him from City to city and and
[39:30] show going before his face showing that
[39:32] the Kingdom of Heaven is is nigh at hand
[39:36] and so that was his church and then he
[39:39] and and furthermore he had 12 and out of
[39:41] those 12 I mean those were hands
[39:43] selected that were really close to him
[39:46] but when it come to the end of it in
[39:49] Jesus's Church there was a great falling
[39:53] away because they didn't understand the
[39:55] statements and they didn't believe what
[39:57] he was saying they they had something
[39:59] wrong with their faith they saw Miracles
[40:02] they saw all kinds of things but when
[40:04] they were challenged with statements
[40:06] they didn't understand they they walked
[40:08] away and they followed him no more and
[40:10] it was really discouraging to those who
[40:12] were left behind brother B explains this
[40:14] to us how Peter was discouraged seeing
[40:16] the multitudes now failing away and the
[40:18] persecutions coming and the negative
[40:20] statements rising and now the 70 go away
[40:24] and Jesus turns and say will you go also
[40:26] and and Peter says who where who we
[40:29] believe amen what was holding Peter
[40:31] there his faith in Jesus Christ not his
[40:33] comprehension of what he
[40:35] said but even at that he says but one of
[40:38] you is a devil
[40:40] M this is what me and this brother were
[40:43] talking
[40:45] about if this happened in Jesus's Church
[40:50] what should we
[40:52] expect so many times we get discouraged
[40:54] I hear people sometimes are discouraged
[40:57] they say this is going on in the message
[40:59] and this is happening in the message and
[41:02] in the message we have Division and in
[41:03] the message we have false Doctrine
[41:06] message we have false Brethren and then
[41:08] the message this and this and I just I I
[41:10] just begin asking how is that different
[41:12] than any other time in the scripture
[41:15] when God's message came forth amen show
[41:18] me where that's
[41:20] unscriptural
[41:21] right but yet some have gotten
[41:23] disappointed and walked away from the
[41:25] message because they saw that not
[41:27] recognizing that wherever Jesus is
[41:29] there's a lot of noise in a mixed
[41:31] multitude am is that right amen and we
[41:36] get disappointed because of our
[41:39] expectation we expect to move into the
[41:42] realm of
[41:45] perfection not realizing that Jesus was
[41:48] our
[41:49] example in all ways amen and all the
[41:53] good things and in all the negative
[41:55] things he was our example
[41:58] Temple brother bam says this way in
[42:02] Hebrews uh CH 3 57 in the Hebrew series
[42:06] he said the old land of Egypt but when
[42:08] you got out there in their Journey just
[42:10] converted and brought out he's talking
[42:11] about the church and the Wilderness
[42:13] brother M calls it the church in the
[42:14] wilderness under Moses this would have
[42:16] been Pastor Moses's church amen it was
[42:19] the church in the wilderness he said
[42:21] they were just converted and brought out
[42:24] then the first thing you know they got
[42:25] in trouble
[42:27] God loves to bring you in trouble he
[42:31] loves to put trouble down and see what
[42:33] you'll do about
[42:35] it now you start to see my title the
[42:39] church in trouble because God loves to
[42:42] do that according to the prophet of God
[42:43] we believe the prophet of God right God
[42:46] loves to put the church in trouble now
[42:49] Moses is sent amen as the leader of the
[42:51] church and now and Moses's church the
[42:53] church in the wilderness brother bam
[42:54] calls him Pastor Moses he starts to type
[42:56] these things out for us amen and and he
[42:59] and he and he brings them out and all of
[43:00] a sudden they're super excited because
[43:02] Pastor Moses has gifts and and amen and
[43:05] he's calling down plagues and he's
[43:06] bringing a tremendous victory over the
[43:08] Egyptians and everything's wonderful
[43:10] until they go out they go out spoiling
[43:12] the Egyptians with with garments of silk
[43:15] and gold on their
[43:17] children everybody walks out rich and
[43:20] and then they come to the Red Sea and
[43:21] they fall into a trap and all Moses is
[43:23] doing is following the pillar of fire
[43:25] the same thing that led him to Egypt the
[43:27] same thing that led to Deliverance the
[43:29] same thing that brought him the word the
[43:31] Passover all the plagues the same thing
[43:33] he's following it but that leads him
[43:35] into what appears to be a trap amen and
[43:38] all of the sudden they begin to murmur
[43:40] against Moses and Moses has all of this
[43:43] fussing going on in his church because
[43:45] they don't
[43:48] understand what's going
[43:50] on they think Moses has failed them but
[43:55] see it was never Moses's success in the
[43:57] beginning Moses never saved them God did
[44:01] Moses never delivered them God did amen
[44:03] it was never Moses to begin with amen so
[44:06] they started looking at Moses Moses oh
[44:08] my goodness look what he did and look at
[44:10] the plagues and look at the spoil and
[44:12] look at all that he T us and it all
[44:14] happened just like Moses said and then
[44:16] because they were looking at Moses now
[44:17] they get out to the Red Sea who do they
[44:19] look at
[44:21] Moses and Moses you failed us and poor
[44:25] Moses is like God
[44:27] help
[44:28] me God says why cist down to me we know
[44:32] the whole story but they got in trouble
[44:34] and all the way down through in the
[44:37] church in the wilderness was nothing but
[44:39] a bunch of
[44:42] trouble remember the bitter Waters of
[44:45] Mara remember uh uh the the problem with
[44:48] the Feast of B peor remember the fiery
[44:51] serpents amen remember when they got
[44:53] tired of mana and God brought them Quail
[44:56] you you remember remember amen when they
[44:58] had no water and brought water from the
[45:00] rock you remember when he got angry and
[45:02] Moses failed and struck the rock twice
[45:04] amen you you remember all of these
[45:06] things that happened in Moses's Church
[45:14] yeah and there was two in there that
[45:18] were genuine
[45:21] Believers where were they in the middle
[45:24] of
[45:25] trouble but all of that was to prove
[45:30] Faith all of that was to prove their
[45:37] faith so God loves to bring you in
[45:42] trouble and where is the place that we
[45:44] hate to be more than any other is in
[45:48] trouble you know if I could just hit a
[45:51] button in my brain and hit delete and
[45:53] reprogram to where I can just say praise
[45:56] God I'm in
[45:58] trouble it would help me so much because
[46:01] the mind is the battle is in the mind
[46:04] amen and the human Spirit doesn't want
[46:05] to go into places where you have to
[46:08] subject yourself to trouble where you
[46:10] have to surrender where you have to
[46:11] sacrifice where you have to make
[46:13] yourself vulnerable and be hurt your
[46:15] human Spirit does not want to go there
[46:17] but there's something in the soul amen
[46:19] that keeps driving us on because there's
[46:20] a joy that lays
[46:24] ahead so Jesus tells us
[46:27] disciples all of these things and and
[46:30] then we find that when they begin when
[46:32] the when the first church amen the first
[46:35] New Testament Church comes up in the
[46:37] book of Acts amen there all of a sudden
[46:40] everything's uh God's doing so much and
[46:42] so many are getting called but Jesus
[46:44] promised them that they would have
[46:46] trouble and we've been talking about
[46:48] this in the Acts chapter 5 but they took
[46:51] Paul or they took Peter I went through
[46:53] it Wednesday and some of the Apostles
[46:55] and they arrested them and threatened
[46:57] them and then they beat them and then
[46:58] they turned them loose amen and
[47:00] threatened them not to preach anymore
[47:02] and they had all this trouble and it
[47:04] says
[47:05] and uh and to him they agreed when they
[47:08] had called the apostles and beaten them
[47:10] they commanded that they should not
[47:12] speak in the name of Jesus and let them
[47:13] go and they departed from the presence
[47:16] of the council
[47:18] rejoicing that they were counted worthy
[47:20] to suffer for his name's sake you see
[47:23] they weren't disappointed because Jesus
[47:25] told them this was going to happen
[47:27] but yet they rejoiced that they were
[47:30] counted
[47:31] worthy to suffer for his name's
[47:34] sake amen amen and we've never been in
[47:38] that kind of a
[47:40] condition we've never been
[47:42] arrested threatened on trial beaten and
[47:47] commanded never to preach in his name
[47:49] again but maybe somebody said asked us a
[47:52] question is why you wear a skirt all the
[47:54] time and why don't you cut your hair
[47:57] and oh we're so
[47:59] offended we're so
[48:04] hurt
[48:06] amen or you guys just follow a man oh
[48:09] we're so
[48:11] wounded why I say praise God I get to
[48:14] suffer for his name's sake I
[48:16] misunderstood Jesus was misunderstood I
[48:19] may even be rejected praise God he was
[48:22] rejected God change our thinking is what
[48:25] I'm asking for myself God change her
[48:28] thinking let's go to John 16
[48:36] together John
[48:47] 16:32 John 16:32 behold the hour cometh
[48:51] yay is now come that you shall be
[48:54] scattered every man to his own
[48:57] and shall leave me alone and yet I am
[49:00] not alone because the father is with
[49:02] me listen remember let's make Jesus our
[49:05] example in all
[49:07] things if all men forsake you you're
[49:10] never
[49:11] alone if no one on this Earth
[49:14] understands you there's one who
[49:16] understands
[49:18] you he says these things have I spoken
[49:20] unto you that in me you might have peace
[49:23] in the world ye shall have Tri
[49:27] tribulation but be of good cheer I have
[49:31] overcome the world Amen oh what a
[49:34] scripture friends
[49:36] Amen in the world you shall have
[49:39] tribulation can anybody say Amen to that
[49:41] am but then his commandment is be of
[49:44] good cheer for I've overcome the world
[49:47] if there's a scripture ever in the Bible
[49:48] that I failed it's this one because I've
[49:51] fallen into diverse Temptations and
[49:53] tribulations but I've not always been in
[49:55] good cheer
[49:58] but oh how I want to be in good cheer
[50:00] that if God puts me through a trial like
[50:02] he did job and deems me worthy and able
[50:05] and capable of going through the trial
[50:07] and not failing I want to say praise God
[50:09] he's found me
[50:11] worthy not oh God why is this happening
[50:14] to
[50:15] me amen and you can guess which one I
[50:17] usually
[50:19] say but Jesus is telling him in the
[50:21] world you shall have tribulation be of
[50:23] good cheer this is a commandment be of
[50:25] good cheer why can we be of good cheer
[50:27] because he's already overcome the world
[50:29] the victory is sure and the joy sets
[50:31] ahead is mine already it's been
[50:34] purchased it's been guaranteed it's been
[50:36] so before the foundation of the world
[50:37] there's not a circumstance that we're
[50:39] going to face that's going to change
[50:40] what God had in his back part of his
[50:42] mind before the foundation of the world
[50:44] and in this world you shall have
[50:45] tribulation but be of good cheer he's
[50:47] already overcome the world so there's
[50:49] not a thing in the world that can stop
[50:52] God's plan for you so no matter what
[50:55] distress no matter what scary statements
[50:57] from a doctor or horrible things coming
[51:00] on the news or or what happens to you
[51:02] personally and nothing can change what
[51:04] God has already foresaw and for the joy
[51:07] that lays ahead let us take up our cross
[51:10] and follow after him cuz that's what he
[51:12] told us to
[51:14] do
[51:20] so yeah I'm just going to say some
[51:23] things and I'm just going to say them
[51:24] amen sometimes you say things and it
[51:26] sounds so bad to say but then you know
[51:28] it's the
[51:29] truth so Jesus didn't have a perfect
[51:35] Church Moses didn't have a perfect
[51:39] Church did Paul have a perfect
[51:43] Church did brother brandham have a
[51:45] perfect church was brandham Tabernacle
[51:47] did he ever say anything negative about
[51:49] things going on in brandham
[51:51] tabernac so if Jesus didn't have a
[51:54] perfect church and Moses didn't have a
[51:56] perfect perfect church and Paul didn't
[51:57] have a perfect church and brother
[51:59] brandham didn't have a perfect Church
[52:01] what made us think we could do better
[52:02] than all of
[52:05] them what made us think we could surpass
[52:08] Moses and Jesus and the Apostle Paul and
[52:11] brother brandham right well brother
[52:14] Brenham had some trouble but not
[52:18] us right I know better than Paul I'm
[52:22] come on
[52:24] friends let's set the right expect
[52:28] I said the right the right expectation
[52:31] is this church is in the middle of
[52:34] trouble you're in the middle of trouble
[52:36] and we will always be because wherever
[52:38] Christ is is where the trouble is where
[52:41] is Satan
[52:42] fighting amen where where Christ is
[52:45] working what is he trying to derail what
[52:47] is he trying to stop what is what is he
[52:49] what is he trying to hinder he's trying
[52:51] to hinder the forward progress of the
[52:53] Gospel he's trying to keep the the word
[52:55] from moving forward and accomplishing
[52:57] its goal amen so where does he put the
[52:59] maximum pressure the maximum pressure
[53:01] comes right to where Christ is working
[53:03] that's why wherever Christ was there's
[53:05] always a lot of
[53:07] noise so what's our
[53:10] expectation well now we have the message
[53:12] and we're going to be
[53:14] perfect listen friends that's not the
[53:17] case let's get that expectation out of
[53:19] our minds
[53:22] right amen let's go to Acts chapter 6
[53:28] I don't know sometimes for me it's just
[53:30] fun to let the scriptures realign my
[53:33] thinking and bust all my traditional
[53:39] understanding because if we don't
[53:42] understand this
[53:45] principle then we feel like because we
[53:49] have the restored truth and we have the
[53:50] message that we should have a perfect
[53:54] church and so but because there's three
[53:57] types of Believers in every church
[53:58] because there's all kinds of maturity
[54:00] levels even in the genuine elect and
[54:02] because we're still in a in a body of
[54:05] Fallen flesh with a sticky cck bur
[54:07] nature because of all of those
[54:09] ingredients it'll never
[54:12] happen and because of that but when our
[54:15] expectation is it'll be
[54:18] perfect like we'll never have a make
[54:20] mistake there'll never be any Strife
[54:21] there'll never be any disagreement the
[54:23] pastor will never make a mistake the
[54:24] deacons and trustees will make every
[54:25] decision perfectly no nobody will ever
[54:28] get out of kilter with anybody else
[54:30] everything's going to go along just
[54:31] perfect amen if that's our expectation
[54:34] because we have the wrong expectation
[54:36] then what we will do is we will build a
[54:39] false
[54:41] front and start to pretend right because
[54:45] this is the way it's supposed to
[54:47] look but maybe it's supposed to look
[54:50] like the Bible's always
[54:53] looked maybe the church is going to be
[54:55] in the midst of trouble maybe there will
[54:56] always be dissension maybe there will
[54:58] always be misunderstanding maybe there
[55:01] will always be false Brethren maybe
[55:02] there will always be doctrinal
[55:06] issues you remember how brother bam said
[55:08] if this church ever puts forth another
[55:09] Branch they'll write another book of
[55:11] Acts behind it amen I challenge you to
[55:14] go back and read the book of Acts again
[55:16] that's right if we're going to have a
[55:18] church just like the book of Acts amen
[55:20] and we know brother brand was referring
[55:21] to the there'll be a restoration of
[55:23] power there'll be the Holy Ghost working
[55:24] in the church you will see healing you
[55:26] will see signs you will see Works amen
[55:29] but don't forget the Church of Acts was
[55:31] in trouble from the beginning of Acts to
[55:33] the end of Acts and there was all kinds
[55:35] of problems in the Church of acts so if
[55:37] this if we go back to being a book of
[55:40] Acts church I challenge you to read it
[55:42] again and when you read it this time
[55:44] you''ll be like oh
[55:46] dear that's the kind of church we're
[55:48] coming oh dear oh dear oh
[55:50] dear
[55:52] yes amen amen
[55:56] Acts chapter
[55:59] 6 now I want you to know where we are
[56:01] don't read look I shouldn't have said
[56:03] Don't Look Down I get too far
[56:06] ahead when we're coming to the Acts
[56:08] chapter 6 we're just shortly after the
[56:11] day of Pentecost the inaugural address
[56:12] of the church 5,000 added at one time
[56:15] 3,000 added another the church is
[56:17] growing there's Supernatural signs
[56:18] happening everywhere the apostles are
[56:20] working I mean their Shadow is healing
[56:22] people they're raising up the lame man
[56:24] they're they're doing all of these
[56:25] wonderful things
[56:26] amen there's a great move going on and
[56:29] this is the church the infant Church the
[56:32] the the the pure virtuous virgin bride
[56:36] that's given to Christ before she falls
[56:38] away yeah we agree amen Acts chapter 6
[56:43] verse1 and in those days when the number
[56:45] of the disciples was multiplied there
[56:47] arose a murmuring of the
[56:49] grecians what are they doing murmuring
[56:51] this is the book of
[56:54] Acts the Holy Ghost just fell
[56:57] and fixed all their
[57:01] problems the Miracles are working the
[57:04] dynamic power of of Christ is being the
[57:06] resurrected power of Christ is in their
[57:08] midst what are they doing
[57:11] murmuring the disciples multiplied there
[57:13] arose a murmuring of the grecians
[57:15] against the Hebrews because their W
[57:17] widows were neglected in the daily
[57:20] ministration then the twel called the
[57:22] multitude of the disciples unto them and
[57:24] said it is not reason that we should
[57:26] leave the world word of God and serve
[57:29] tables there wherefore Brethren look you
[57:31] out among you seven men of honest report
[57:33] full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom
[57:35] we may appoint over this business but we
[57:38] will give ourselves continually to
[57:40] prayer and to the ministry of the
[57:43] word brand new virgin bride handed to
[57:49] Christ fresh from
[57:51] Pentecost where the Holy Ghost was
[57:53] falling fresh
[57:56] and there began a murmuring against from
[57:58] the grecians against the Hebrews
[58:00] because apparently the grecians didn't
[58:03] feel like the Greek widows were getting
[58:05] as much as the Hebrews widows so there
[58:07] was some unfair treatment or at least
[58:09] there was suspected unfair treatment and
[58:11] they started complaining to the
[58:12] ministers amen that listen they gave
[58:15] this Widow this and this Widow got this
[58:17] and our widows aren't getting the same
[58:19] care as the Hebrew
[58:25] with so who wants to have a book of Acts
[58:29] Church hey I think we got
[58:35] one right and let's just be real about
[58:38] it amen amen let's just be
[58:41] honest this is the way it is there's
[58:43] always going to be trouble because
[58:45] that's for our
[58:46] Perfection there's always going to be
[58:48] something to reconcile because that's
[58:50] for our growth there's always going to
[58:51] be a misunderstanding amen because God
[58:54] is going to do that to cause us to step
[58:56] up and manifest The Life of Christ
[58:58] because he was criticized from the time
[59:00] he was a baby he was misunderstood he
[59:02] was falsely accused he was rejected he
[59:04] was all of these things and in all of
[59:06] that he manifest the life of God okay so
[59:09] what do you think we're going to need to
[59:11] do in the face of all these things we're
[59:13] going to have to manifest The Life of
[59:16] Christ
[59:18] amen so this is the book of Acts I mean
[59:23] right out of the shoot friends this is
[59:24] early on this is when they go to the
[59:27] Ephesian age and start to fall away this
[59:28] is right out of the gate and the whole
[59:30] reason they had to establish deacons is
[59:32] because there was a murmuring there was
[59:34] a dissension between which widows got
[59:37] more of the daily because you remember
[59:39] in this day they threw everything
[59:40] together in one pot and to distribute it
[59:42] and the Hebrew women were apparently or
[59:45] I listen I don't I don't know if this
[59:47] was true or not true but at least it was
[59:48] an
[59:51] accusation amen sometimes we wonder why
[59:54] we can't all agree on something
[59:57] they didn't in the book of Acts Paul and
[59:59] Barnabas didn't even agree on who to
[1:00:01] take on the next missionary journey and
[1:00:03] they both had the Holy
[1:00:06] Ghost that's also the book of
[1:00:10] Acts amen so so brother bam says it this
[1:00:15] way and um God doesn't call a man to
[1:00:17] judgment without first warning him he
[1:00:19] says but you see in the church is the
[1:00:22] pastor and the pastor is a special
[1:00:24] person this is when he's going through
[1:00:25] the five Ministry he's built to where he
[1:00:28] can put up with the fusses of the
[1:00:33] people why are they fussing they have
[1:00:36] the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost he's a burden Bearer he's the ox
[1:00:42] of the team he's a man that can sit down
[1:00:45] when somebody's got something against
[1:00:46] somebody else and sit down with them two
[1:00:48] families and take neither side and
[1:00:49] reason it out and bring it right back
[1:00:51] into sweetness he's a pastor he knows
[1:00:53] how to take care of things
[1:00:57] question is do we still need
[1:01:00] pastors if we still need pastors then
[1:01:02] maybe we still need
[1:01:04] somebody who can help reconcile when
[1:01:07] there's differences and disagreements
[1:01:09] and who can put up with the fusses of
[1:01:11] the people well if listen if we still
[1:01:15] have pastors then we still have fusses
[1:01:19] of the people and disagreements that
[1:01:21] have to be
[1:01:24] reconciled so let's have the correct
[1:01:28] expectation right that way we don't get
[1:01:30] derailed every time somebody doesn't
[1:01:32] agree on something or every time we hit
[1:01:34] a misunderstanding listen it's always
[1:01:36] been there it'll always be there it's
[1:01:39] not that we're ever trying to get to a
[1:01:40] place of perfection where we never come
[1:01:42] to a misunderstanding or a disagreement
[1:01:44] or a different view what we're trying to
[1:01:46] do is grow into a place where we handle
[1:01:48] it the way Jesus handled it not that
[1:01:50] it's abolished from us but it's handled
[1:01:53] correctly and that's why it'll keep
[1:01:56] coming around and keep coming around and
[1:01:58] keep coming around until we learn how to
[1:02:01] handle it amen because we've got to
[1:02:03] manifest the life of Jesus
[1:02:06] Christ when he was spit on he didn't
[1:02:08] spit back well when he was riled against
[1:02:11] he didn't R back how are you going to
[1:02:14] manifest that part of his
[1:02:15] nature unless you're spit
[1:02:18] on unless you're riled
[1:02:21] against against unless you're
[1:02:23] misunderstood or criticized amen
[1:02:26] but when we get misunderstood or
[1:02:28] criticized the first thing we want to do
[1:02:29] is run
[1:02:31] away but Jesus didn't have that option
[1:02:35] because he had the father's
[1:02:36] will so what God wants us to do is
[1:02:40] listen when when uh Peter when God told
[1:02:45] Peter when he reconciled Peter by the
[1:02:48] Sea of tiberias and he reconciled him
[1:02:50] back together and and he said do does
[1:02:51] thou love me does thou love me three
[1:02:53] times giving him a chance to reconcile
[1:02:56] then he tells him how he'll die you know
[1:02:58] you'll be led where you don't want to go
[1:03:00] and your arms will be spread out
[1:03:01] signifying a crucifixion and and all of
[1:03:03] these things and and he he begins to
[1:03:06] realize what what life might be like for
[1:03:09] him and he's walking with Jesus and he
[1:03:11] looks back and he sees John and he says
[1:03:13] Lord what about
[1:03:16] him like if I'm going to have to suffer
[1:03:18] is he going to have to suffer why cuz
[1:03:20] misery loves company I guess I don't
[1:03:22] know if I'm suffering I just want to
[1:03:24] know he's suffering too
[1:03:28] I mean that's human nature you know what
[1:03:30] happens is when we get into situations
[1:03:32] where it's difficult we look around and
[1:03:33] see somebody else who's seemingly
[1:03:35] blessed and we feel so why don't they
[1:03:37] ever have to suffer and the problem is
[1:03:39] you have no idea what's going on in
[1:03:41] their life and you don't know what level
[1:03:42] of suffering they suffer with we just
[1:03:45] make assumptions that I'm having it hard
[1:03:47] but everybody else has it
[1:03:49] better so Paul or Peter says what about
[1:03:53] him and Jesus says what is that to thee
[1:03:57] what if he should abide until I
[1:04:01] return what if he never has a trouble a
[1:04:04] day in his life and I shower blessings
[1:04:06] upon him and and he has no trouble and
[1:04:09] he makes it till the day I arrive and
[1:04:11] and life is Cushy for him right what's
[1:04:14] that to
[1:04:20] thee see we can't
[1:04:23] control what happens
[1:04:27] We Can't Stop bad things from happening
[1:04:29] we can't control negative circumstances
[1:04:32] the only thing we control is our
[1:04:33] response amen
[1:04:36] individually our response that's where
[1:04:39] God's holding us each one individually
[1:04:41] responsible is how we respond to
[1:04:45] things amen and don't worry if you
[1:04:48] messed up you'll get another
[1:04:51] chance I'm quite sure of that I'm quite
[1:04:55] I'm by the this stage of the game I'm
[1:04:56] quite
[1:04:58] certain let's go to Acts chapter
[1:05:13] 15 Acts chapter
[1:05:16] 15 verse
[1:05:19] 1 and certain men which came down from
[1:05:22] Judea taught the Brethren and said
[1:05:24] except you be circumcised after the
[1:05:25] manner of Moses you cannot be saved when
[1:05:28] therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small
[1:05:30] dissension and disputation with them
[1:05:32] they determined that Paul and barnabus
[1:05:33] and certain others of them should go up
[1:05:35] to Jerusalem and unto the apostles and
[1:05:37] Elders about this
[1:05:39] question so in the book of Acts you have
[1:05:42] doctrinal differences amongst the
[1:05:47] Brethren some were trying to take them
[1:05:50] back to the previous age and take them
[1:05:52] back to the law of Moses and saying you
[1:05:54] know you have to keep this and you have
[1:05:56] to have some sign of your circumcision
[1:05:58] and you have to have some evidence and
[1:05:59] proof amen and and Paul is trying to
[1:06:01] show them it's all by faith and and now
[1:06:04] uh uh they're having this dispute so
[1:06:05] they send them up to Jerusalem and they
[1:06:07] have the Jerusalem Council where the
[1:06:09] Brethren are gathered together James and
[1:06:11] and Peter and John and Paul and Barnabas
[1:06:14] and others there and if you go to verse
[1:06:17] 24 let skip over to verse 24 and this is
[1:06:20] their conclusion that they want to send
[1:06:22] out to the Brethren says for as much as
[1:06:25] we have heard that certain which went
[1:06:26] out from us have troubled you with words
[1:06:29] subverting your soul saying You must be
[1:06:31] circumcised and keep the law to whom we
[1:06:33] gave no such
[1:06:35] commandment so there was Brothers coming
[1:06:37] down from Jerusalem claiming to speak
[1:06:41] for everybody in Jerusalem claiming to
[1:06:44] know the truth and claiming Amen to have
[1:06:46] the correct doctrinal understanding and
[1:06:49] they're going through Antioch and other
[1:06:50] places and they're beginning to
[1:06:52] challenge the things that Paul and
[1:06:54] Barnabas are teaching on Grace and
[1:06:56] they're trying to bring them they're
[1:06:57] they're trying to hold on to some old
[1:06:59] tradition and bring it bring it into
[1:07:01] this new way amen and and Paul's
[1:07:04] disputing with them but they're doing so
[1:07:05] by the authority amen of coming from
[1:07:08] Jerusalem yeah
[1:07:13] yeah so is there anything different in
[1:07:15] the message than in the book of
[1:07:19] Acts no it's the same yeah we can read
[1:07:23] the book of Acts and say that's going on
[1:07:26] all around us all the time it's been
[1:07:28] going on since the
[1:07:31] beginning this must be where Christ
[1:07:35] is this must be normal this must be an
[1:07:39] evidence that Christ is in our midst and
[1:07:41] the devil's trying to derail it well
[1:07:43] praise
[1:07:44] God I see this in the book of Acts I see
[1:07:47] it in Paul's Ministry I see it in Moses
[1:07:50] I see it in Jesus I see it all the way
[1:07:52] through H praise be to God this must be
[1:07:55] where the truth is cuz this is where the
[1:07:56] battle
[1:07:58] is thank you Lord Jesus
[1:08:02] amen people have walked away because
[1:08:05] there's too many
[1:08:07] differences Brothers don't agree there's
[1:08:11] doctrinal differences there's teaching
[1:08:12] this and there's teaching that and some
[1:08:15] people have just walked
[1:08:17] away right but there's nothing different
[1:08:20] about that than the book of Acts there's
[1:08:23] always been different Brothers with
[1:08:24] different ideas and different doctrines
[1:08:27] it's always been there and it wasn't
[1:08:30] right to walk away in the book of Acts
[1:08:32] and it's not right to walk away
[1:08:38] now so they sent a letter now this
[1:08:41] Jerusalem Council with Peter and John
[1:08:44] and James all they they put together a
[1:08:46] letter saying that hey we didn't teach
[1:08:48] this amen just go and don't eat anything
[1:08:50] strangled and stay away from fornication
[1:08:52] and idols and and and and that's it and
[1:08:55] they sent this letter and they sent it
[1:08:56] with uh uh uh two Brethren from them one
[1:08:59] of them was Silas and they went down and
[1:09:01] they went to Antioch and they went
[1:09:02] around and they shared this letter that
[1:09:04] settled the matter it was done the
[1:09:06] Brethren settled
[1:09:08] it
[1:09:10] wrong everywhere Paul went they followed
[1:09:13] Paul trying to spread their own Doctrine
[1:09:16] Paul was dealing with this in Galatians
[1:09:17] that's what the whole book of Galatians
[1:09:19] is about the entirety of oh foolish
[1:09:21] Galatians who has Bewitched
[1:09:23] you having received the gospel how come
[1:09:25] you receive another which is not another
[1:09:27] the whole book of Galatians is because
[1:09:28] these same kind of men with the same
[1:09:31] understanding although it was settled at
[1:09:32] the Jerusalem Council it was never
[1:09:34] settled because that Spirit still lives
[1:09:36] on and wherever Paul would establish a
[1:09:39] church it wasn't too long till they were
[1:09:41] following Paul around trying to
[1:09:43] establish themselves and in the book of
[1:09:44] Corinthians Paul is saying they're
[1:09:46] they're zealous Over You for their own
[1:09:48] effect they want to gather disciples
[1:09:50] unto themselves and they want to have uh
[1:09:52] accolades and they want to uh have
[1:09:54] credential and they want to use you
[1:09:56] they're subverting your souls for their
[1:09:58] own
[1:09:59] gain
[1:10:02] right the church has always been in
[1:10:04] trouble
[1:10:06] friends amen amen but the Believers have
[1:10:09] always for the joy that lays
[1:10:12] ahead kept moving
[1:10:16] forward we're never going to stop these
[1:10:19] things so there's no point in fighting
[1:10:21] them
[1:10:23] all there's no point in trying to stop
[1:10:27] them just preach the truth the way we
[1:10:30] see the truth and move forward with
[1:10:34] Christ listen if Paul with all of the
[1:10:38] wisdom that God had given him in the
[1:10:39] word all the Revelation he got in Arabia
[1:10:43] three and a half years getting straight
[1:10:45] from Jesus Christ The Gospel truth if he
[1:10:48] couldn't stop it what makes you think we
[1:10:52] can right yeah
[1:10:56] you'll find out here shortly that
[1:10:58] neither could brother brandham stop it
[1:11:01] right in his own Fellowship in his own
[1:11:04] ministerial ranks yeah if he couldn't
[1:11:06] stop it what makes us think we can stop
[1:11:09] it are we better than
[1:11:13] them
[1:11:15] amen Paul in Corinthians it's amazing
[1:11:19] Paul is having to defend his
[1:11:21] apostleship because there's others
[1:11:23] saying he's not really all that yeah and
[1:11:27] Paul's this and that and he may have
[1:11:29] gotten some things wrong you should
[1:11:30] listen to us and you can tell by his
[1:11:32] answer what the debate is and and
[1:11:34] there's another man writing to them in 2
[1:11:36] Corinthians 10 uh ver verse 10 he says
[1:11:39] for his letter say say they are weighty
[1:11:42] and Powerful amen the ones who are
[1:11:45] subverting Paul are saying when he
[1:11:47] writes you a letter they're weighty and
[1:11:49] Powerful but his bodily presence is weak
[1:11:52] and his speech is
[1:11:54] contemptible what are they doing they're
[1:11:56] criticizing Paul yeah they're saying
[1:11:58] when he writes you a letter he's a big
[1:12:00] man and he's got power and with power of
[1:12:03] his pen but when he's in your presence
[1:12:06] he's weak and his speech is contemptible
[1:12:10] he he why would you want to listen to
[1:12:12] Paul yeah listen we we read through the
[1:12:17] Bible and we think Paul Paul was aaz in
[1:12:20] Paul's day Paul was highly rejected yeah
[1:12:24] High
[1:12:26] rejected criticized amen by those who
[1:12:29] were Christians not just
[1:12:31] Jews the ones who are criticizing here
[1:12:34] in Corinthians these are not Jews
[1:12:36] holding to the traditions of the fathers
[1:12:38] these are converts to Christ amen these
[1:12:41] are the judaizers who are trying to mix
[1:12:43] amen the old Covenant with Moses with
[1:12:45] the New Covenant amen so they're
[1:12:46] Christians they claim to be Christians
[1:12:48] believing in Jesus the crucifixion the
[1:12:51] Resurrection the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:53] Ghost they're the on that are
[1:12:55] criticizing Paul and defaming his
[1:12:58] character and trying to seow Discord
[1:13:00] between him and brother and try to bring
[1:13:02] him down off a pedestal and make him
[1:13:04] look weak and make him look bad and make
[1:13:06] him look ignorant
[1:13:11] yeah how could they do
[1:13:14] that and when we get to the Corinthians
[1:13:17] the church is not very
[1:13:19] old still a young
[1:13:22] Church let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:13:25] CH 11
[1:13:39] together second Corinthians chap
[1:13:45] 11 verse 22 he's still having to make
[1:13:49] the case said are they Hebrews so am I
[1:13:54] are they Israelites so am I are they
[1:13:56] Seed of Abraham so am I are they
[1:13:59] Ministers of Christ so I just want you
[1:14:01] to
[1:14:02] think who is this yeah that's contesting
[1:14:07] Paul and defaming Paul Hebrews
[1:14:11] Israelites Seed of Abraham are they
[1:14:13] Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I
[1:14:16] am
[1:14:17] more so these were Ministers of Christ
[1:14:21] too I am more in labors more abundant in
[1:14:25] Stripes above measure in prisons more
[1:14:27] frequent in deaths of of the Jews five
[1:14:31] times received die 40 Stripes save one
[1:14:33] Thrice was I beaten with rods once was I
[1:14:35] stoned Thrice I have suffered shipwreck
[1:14:37] a night and a day I have been in the
[1:14:39] deep and journeyings often in Perils of
[1:14:41] water in Perils of robbers in perils by
[1:14:44] my own countrymen that's because the
[1:14:45] Jews wanted to kill him now listen to
[1:14:50] this and
[1:14:53] perils by my own country country men in
[1:14:55] perils by the Heathen and perils in the
[1:14:58] city and perils in the wilderness and
[1:15:00] perils in the sea and perils among false
[1:15:04] Brethren and weariness and painfulness
[1:15:08] and watchings often in hunger and in
[1:15:10] thirst and fasting is often in cold and
[1:15:14] in nakedness beside those things that
[1:15:16] are without that which cometh upon me
[1:15:18] daily the care of all the churches who
[1:15:21] is weak and I am not weak who is
[1:15:23] offended and I burn not
[1:15:26] not Paul went on to tell them so these
[1:15:30] men that were contesting him were
[1:15:32] Hebrews Israelites Seed of Abraham
[1:15:34] Ministers of Christ yeah but then he
[1:15:37] goes down and begins to describe what
[1:15:38] his life is
[1:15:43] like how many thinks Paul was in a lot
[1:15:45] of
[1:15:47] trouble all the time and perils in the
[1:15:51] wilderness and perils in the city and in
[1:15:53] perils in the sea
[1:15:56] in perils amongst my own countrymen and
[1:15:59] Perils of the Heathen and in Perils of
[1:16:01] false Brethren
[1:16:04] amen these were those who claimed to be
[1:16:06] part of the church and part of
[1:16:10] Christ brother Bram says in Revelation
[1:16:13] chap 5 part 1 from 1961 he says what if
[1:16:16] every person in this world was a
[1:16:18] Christian what if everybody was a
[1:16:20] Spirit-filled Christian why we wouldn't
[1:16:22] need any Faith No More would wouldn't
[1:16:25] need any faith at all see faith is the
[1:16:27] very is the very thing that we're saved
[1:16:29] by is Faith and that's the reason there
[1:16:31] has to be some disagree with it so that
[1:16:33] we can exercise Faith do you understand
[1:16:36] it now you've got to have the other side
[1:16:38] you've got to have a bad woman to make a
[1:16:40] real one stand out right there's got to
[1:16:42] be a lie to make the truth positive and
[1:16:44] make it shine good if everything was
[1:16:46] truth it would just be so common
[1:16:48] see so where do we express
[1:16:52] Faith Amen in the face of doubt if some
[1:16:55] didn't disagree brother B said if some
[1:16:58] didn't disagree with it some some has
[1:17:00] got to disagree with it so that we can
[1:17:02] exercise
[1:17:03] Faith there has got to be false Brethren
[1:17:06] to show True Brethren amen it has to be
[1:17:09] there there's got to be some that
[1:17:11] contend with and strive against and and
[1:17:13] argue and disagree it has to be there
[1:17:16] friends so that we can express our faith
[1:17:18] in the word of God because our faith is
[1:17:20] expressed When Faith is
[1:17:22] challenged and how's our faith expressed
[1:17:24] rest because of the joy that lay ahead
[1:17:28] cuz what do I have faith in that I'm a
[1:17:30] great person and my life should be good
[1:17:31] and God protects me and nobody going to
[1:17:33] say anything against me that's not the
[1:17:34] faith my faith is in the joy that lays
[1:17:36] ahead the promise of God Amen that is
[1:17:38] mine and for the joy that lays ahead I
[1:17:41] will endure the cross despising the
[1:17:43] shame and we don't like it amen we don't
[1:17:45] want to go through persecutions
[1:17:46] rejections sicknesses we don't want to
[1:17:49] go through abandonment we don't want to
[1:17:50] go through any of these things but we
[1:17:52] are willing to because of the joy that
[1:17:54] lays ahead head that's the expression of
[1:17:56] our
[1:17:57] faith we can all Express faith when
[1:17:59] we're all here together and everything's
[1:18:01] going fine we can have faith but can we
[1:18:03] have faith Amen in the face of obstacles
[1:18:05] and how will we be able to
[1:18:07] endure by looking
[1:18:11] ahead be of good
[1:18:14] cheer in this world you shall have
[1:18:16] tribulation but be of good cheer for I
[1:18:20] have overcome the world Amen
[1:18:26] amen Paul in First Corinthians start to
[1:18:30] starts to correct the church because in
[1:18:32] the church are divisions some are of
[1:18:35] Apollos some of Paul and some are more
[1:18:38] righteous than Sam of
[1:18:40] Christ but they start to have divisions
[1:18:43] and they they start to uh argue and Paul
[1:18:46] is now trying to correct this and saying
[1:18:48] who is Paul and who is apollis are not
[1:18:51] we just Ministers of Christ amen one
[1:18:53] Waters
[1:18:55] one one one plants one Waters but God
[1:18:58] gives the
[1:19:00] increase what church is this this is
[1:19:02] Paul's Church this is the church Paul
[1:19:03] established this is the one he preached
[1:19:05] this Doctrine
[1:19:06] to and what are they doing they're
[1:19:10] dividing over well I believe this one is
[1:19:14] whatever my favorite or more accurate or
[1:19:16] I don't know what they were separating
[1:19:18] over but I'm am
[1:19:20] Aus and I'm of Paul and Paul says
[1:19:26] nonsense it's all
[1:19:29] Christ anything good comes from Apollo
[1:19:31] it's Christ if anything good comes from
[1:19:32] Paul it's Christ amen so let's look to
[1:19:36] Christ in 1 Corinthians 3 if you could
[1:19:38] turn back there with
[1:19:47] me and I know that the Corinthian Church
[1:19:49] is an immature church I understand that
[1:19:51] he's trying to teach him spiritual gifts
[1:19:52] and trying to bring him to maturity
[1:19:55] uh and we we should be coming to the end
[1:19:58] of the church ages to a more mature
[1:19:59] Church the problem is when we do the
[1:20:02] same thing that they did in Corinth in
[1:20:05] the Corinthian Church it makes me wonder
[1:20:07] how mature we actually
[1:20:10] are 1 Corinthians CH 3:1 and I Brethren
[1:20:14] could not speak unto you as unto
[1:20:15] spiritual but unto carnal even as unto
[1:20:17] babes in Christ I have fed you with milk
[1:20:20] and not meat for hither to you were not
[1:20:22] able to Bear it neither yet now are you
[1:20:24] able for ye are for ye are yet carnal
[1:20:28] for whereas there is among you envying
[1:20:30] and strife and divisions are you not
[1:20:33] carnal and walk as
[1:20:34] men so maybe a definition of being
[1:20:38] carnal is having envying and strife and
[1:20:41] division or at least those are
[1:20:42] attributes of being carnal according to
[1:20:47] Paul for while one saith I'm of Paul
[1:20:50] another I'm of Apollos are you not
[1:20:54] carnal
[1:20:57] so there was some carnality in Paul's
[1:21:02] church amen and I can say that maybe
[1:21:06] once in a while some carnality creeps in
[1:21:08] amongst
[1:21:10] us you think that's fair
[1:21:13] am but oh let us deal with it friends
[1:21:17] help us to recognize it and say God I
[1:21:19] don't want that in my life but I want to
[1:21:22] endure I want to press towards what's
[1:21:25] important I want to care about the most
[1:21:27] important and I don't want to worry
[1:21:28] about all these other
[1:21:32] things the Apostle Paul go let's go back
[1:21:35] to 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:21:39] 4 I love this what he says 1 Corinthians
[1:21:42] chapter
[1:21:45] 4 and verse
[1:21:47] 8 we are troubled on every
[1:21:52] side so
[1:21:54] I like this I like the fact that he said
[1:21:58] we because I can put myself in the
[1:22:02] we well you want to include yourself in
[1:22:05] the
[1:22:06] we we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:22:11] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:22:14] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:22:17] down but not destroyed always bearing
[1:22:21] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[1:22:22] Jesus that life also of Jesus might be
[1:22:25] made manifest in our
[1:22:29] body for we which live are always
[1:22:31] delivered unto death for jesus' sake
[1:22:33] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:22:35] made manifest in our mortal bodies we
[1:22:39] may not be taken to death by crucifixion
[1:22:43] or we may not be led Away by soldiers
[1:22:46] and be
[1:22:48] beheaded but we ought to be dying
[1:22:51] daily and in our dying to ourselves in
[1:22:54] the mid of all of these things dying out
[1:22:56] to all of this it should be manifesting
[1:22:58] the life of Jesus in our flesh so we
[1:23:01] should be dying in the midst of all of
[1:23:04] these things Paul I want to read what
[1:23:07] Paul
[1:23:09] says he
[1:23:11] says we are
[1:23:14] troubled we are
[1:23:16] perplexed
[1:23:20] persecuted and bearing about in the body
[1:23:22] the dying of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:26] so is that
[1:23:27] true
[1:23:29] yes yes but what else he says
[1:23:33] is we are not
[1:23:35] distressed we are not in despair we are
[1:23:39] not
[1:23:40] forsaken uh and not
[1:23:45] destroyed we're a church in the middle
[1:23:47] of trouble but we're not forsaken we're
[1:23:51] not destroyed we're not distressed amen
[1:23:55] we're we're perplexed but we're not in
[1:23:57] despair so do we find ourselves in
[1:24:00] trouble yes do you ever find yourself in
[1:24:04] distress yes do you ever find yourself
[1:24:08] perplexed have you ever been cast
[1:24:11] down then you've been in the same place
[1:24:13] as Paul has been praise God but let's
[1:24:17] the other side be a reality to us also
[1:24:20] we are we are not distressed though
[1:24:24] troubled not distressed perplexed not in
[1:24:27] despair we are not Forsaken and we are
[1:24:30] not destroyed we can be a church in the
[1:24:33] middle of trouble amen but we can be
[1:24:35] overcoming by the grace of
[1:24:38] God Amen God is so good to us let's go
[1:24:42] to Acts chapter
[1:24:49] 16 now I'm praying that
[1:24:52] God will correct all of my wrong
[1:24:57] thinking and so that I can actually take
[1:25:00] on the life of those who who lived for
[1:25:03] him in every generation and let's begin
[1:25:05] at Acts 16:
[1:25:08] 19 and when her master saw that the hope
[1:25:11] of their gains were gone they caught
[1:25:13] Paul and Silas and Drew them into the
[1:25:15] marketplace unto the rulers and brought
[1:25:17] them to the magistrate saying these men
[1:25:19] being Jews do exceedingly trouble our
[1:25:21] city and teach Customs which are not
[1:25:24] lawful for us to receive neither to
[1:25:26] observe being Romans and the multitude
[1:25:29] rose up together against them and the
[1:25:31] magistrate ran off their clothes and
[1:25:32] commanded to beat them and when they had
[1:25:35] laid many stripes upon them they cast
[1:25:37] them into prison charging the Jailer to
[1:25:39] keep them safely who having received
[1:25:42] such a charge thrust them into the inner
[1:25:44] prison and made their feet fast in
[1:25:47] stalks and at midnight Paul and Silas
[1:25:51] prayed and sang Praises unto God
[1:25:54] amen and the prisoners heard
[1:25:59] them oh this scripture challenges me
[1:26:03] friends I have never been in a situation
[1:26:06] that ever comes close to the trouble
[1:26:09] that they were
[1:26:11] in a multitude rose up against
[1:26:14] them took them to the magistrate who
[1:26:17] rent off their clothes they ripped their
[1:26:19] clothes off in the Public
[1:26:21] Square rent their clothes off and beat
[1:26:25] them and when they laid many stripes
[1:26:27] upon them they cast them in
[1:26:30] prison charging the Jailer to keep them
[1:26:32] safe and having received such a charge
[1:26:34] thrust them into the inner prison and
[1:26:36] made their feet fast in
[1:26:39] stalks the the crowd hated them you
[1:26:43] talking about rejection this is
[1:26:46] rejection somebody's saying they don't
[1:26:48] like your nose is not rejection this is
[1:26:53] rejection the whole multitude come
[1:26:55] against them stripping their clothes off
[1:26:57] and beating them do you know how
[1:26:58] shameful humiliating how much rejection
[1:27:01] how much abandonment you feel how much
[1:27:03] pain from the beating that you would
[1:27:04] feel so they're hurting all over then
[1:27:07] they take them and throw them in the
[1:27:08] prison and the Jailer puts them in
[1:27:10] stalks their their legs are fast and
[1:27:12] shut their arms may be in Chains or
[1:27:14] maybe they're maybe maybe it's like the
[1:27:16] old uh European stocks where their feet
[1:27:18] and their hands are in the same stock
[1:27:20] and they're in this position beating
[1:27:22] bleeding bruised naked stripped rejected
[1:27:26] and the only thing they can think to do
[1:27:28] is sing praises to
[1:27:34] God maybe the next time somebody doesn't
[1:27:36] like my nose I'll sing praises to God
[1:27:39] maybe I can start to handle my little
[1:27:41] troubles on this Earth am mean if I can
[1:27:44] look at what Paul went through and I can
[1:27:45] look at what Moses went through I can
[1:27:46] look at what brother Brandon went
[1:27:48] through and I can look at what Jesus
[1:27:49] went through and I can say oh God they
[1:27:51] misunderstand me they say things about
[1:27:53] me that's not true but you're worthy to
[1:27:55] be praised anyhow because I'm not
[1:27:57] looking at that I'm looking beyond that
[1:27:59] I'm looking at a promise that you gave
[1:28:01] me and I'm looking at a joy that'll be
[1:28:03] unfolded on this Earth I'm not looking
[1:28:05] here for pleasure and comfort and ease
[1:28:07] of life I'm looking here to please you
[1:28:09] in everything and whatever you allow is
[1:28:12] for a purpose but I'm looking
[1:28:16] ahead let's go to acts 23
[1:28:25] acts
[1:28:27] 23 and verse
[1:28:34] 10 acts
[1:28:36] 23:10 this is Paul being imprisoned and
[1:28:39] tried this ISS after he went to
[1:28:41] Jerusalem and when there arose a great
[1:28:43] dissension the chief the chief Captain
[1:28:45] fearing lest Paul should have been
[1:28:47] pulled in pie of them commanded the
[1:28:49] soldiers to go down and to take him by
[1:28:51] force from among them and to bring him
[1:28:53] into the castle
[1:28:55] and the night following the Lord stood
[1:28:57] by him and said be of good
[1:29:00] cheer Paul for as thou Hast testified to
[1:29:03] me in Jerusalem so must thou bear
[1:29:05] witness also at
[1:29:08] Rome you know what this means this means
[1:29:10] Paul is not going to be released from
[1:29:12] prison yeah this means he's going to go
[1:29:15] as a prisoner to Rome and he's going to
[1:29:17] testify in Rome the same way he did in
[1:29:19] Jerusalem which he testified being bound
[1:29:22] and so God comes to Paul and he says oh
[1:29:26] Paul be
[1:29:29] happy cuz you're going to stay in prison
[1:29:32] yeah because you're going to testify of
[1:29:34] me in Rome amen Paul who could be beaten
[1:29:38] as strip naked locked in stocks and he
[1:29:41] and Silas could sing praises to God and
[1:29:44] they weren't Whispering friends the
[1:29:45] other prisoners down there heard
[1:29:49] them I'd say Paul could have been of
[1:29:51] good cheer he learned how
[1:29:54] what if Jesus tells you your trial is
[1:29:56] not going to end but I've got a purpose
[1:29:58] in it it's actually going to get worse
[1:30:00] you're actually going to be taken out of
[1:30:01] your home country you're going to be
[1:30:02] taken to Rome and you're going to stay
[1:30:03] in prison but be of good
[1:30:08] cheer oh praise
[1:30:13] God I'm not going to turn to all these
[1:30:15] next scriptures I'm just going to recite
[1:30:16] a few but in second Timothy 4 Paul
[1:30:20] starts to tell Timothy in verse n do thy
[1:30:24] ding to come to me short come shortly
[1:30:26] unto me for Deus has forsaken me having
[1:30:31] love this present world and is departed
[1:30:35] into
[1:30:35] thessalonica crescence to galatia Titus
[1:30:38] into dtia only Luke is with me take Mark
[1:30:41] and bring him with thee for he is
[1:30:42] profitable to me in the
[1:30:44] ministry Paul is writing that Deus has
[1:30:47] forsaking but who was Deus Deus was a
[1:30:50] close associate if you look in the
[1:30:51] letter to filon he says
[1:30:54] uh he names four Brethren Marcus
[1:30:58] aristarchus Deus Lucas as my fellow
[1:31:03] laborers one of his fellow laborers one
[1:31:06] of his friends one that traveled with
[1:31:07] him and preached ones that he could
[1:31:09] recommend to others yeah forsook
[1:31:14] him Amen in Acts chapter 20 let's turn
[1:31:18] to Acts chapter 20
[1:31:25] in verse
[1:31:27] 17 in Acts chapter 20 Paul is heading
[1:31:30] back to Jerusalem and there's been
[1:31:32] there's been prophecies all along the
[1:31:34] way that he's going to be imprisoned and
[1:31:36] persecuted and and taken captive and so
[1:31:39] he knows that he's going maybe to his
[1:31:41] death and so here in Acts
[1:31:44] 2017 it says and from meitus he sent to
[1:31:47] epis and called the Elders of the church
[1:31:50] so Paul doesn't want to take the time to
[1:31:52] go up to Ephesians it says in the book
[1:31:53] of Acts don't want to go to Ephesus but
[1:31:55] he goes to malitas he's on his way he
[1:31:56] wants to get there by the Feast of
[1:31:58] Passover so he calls for the Elders of
[1:32:00] the church to come so he gathers all the
[1:32:02] elders to them because he wants to talk
[1:32:03] to the elders and here's part of what he
[1:32:06] says let's start in verse
[1:32:09] 28 he said take heed therefore unto
[1:32:12] yourselves and to all the flock over the
[1:32:13] which the Holy Ghost hath made you
[1:32:15] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:32:18] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:32:19] blood for I know this that after my
[1:32:22] departing shall Grievous wol enter in
[1:32:24] among you not sparing the flock also of
[1:32:27] your own selves shall men arise speaking
[1:32:30] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:32:33] after
[1:32:37] them I would like to bring your
[1:32:40] attention to the fact that we're still
[1:32:41] in the book of
[1:32:43] Acts this is still a book of Acts
[1:32:47] Church These are the men that Paul
[1:32:49] ordained as elders and worked with as
[1:32:51] Elders of the church and and he gathered
[1:32:54] the elders and the elders all gathered
[1:32:56] around and he and he began to warn them
[1:32:59] and he claimed that he had been warning
[1:33:01] them for 3 years and and he says I know
[1:33:03] that after my departure Grievious W
[1:33:06] wolves shall come in not sparing the
[1:33:08] flock and he says and among your own
[1:33:12] selves shall men who is your own
[1:33:15] selves these were the preachers the
[1:33:18] Elders of the church that Paul had
[1:33:20] worked with and ordained and established
[1:33:22] and taught
[1:33:25] see the same thing happens in the
[1:33:26] message when brother brandham
[1:33:31] left and we get discouraged because some
[1:33:34] of the men that knew him and some of the
[1:33:35] men that were close to him and look what
[1:33:37] they did and look how horrible and look
[1:33:38] how they gather is it any different than
[1:33:41] Paul's
[1:33:42] Ministry is it any different than the
[1:33:44] book of Acts is what we've seen and what
[1:33:46] we see is it any different than the book
[1:33:48] of
[1:33:49] Acts
[1:33:51] no we only get discouraged when we have
[1:33:54] the wrong expectation
[1:33:57] amen
[1:33:59] Amen brother
[1:34:01] Brenham he makes this
[1:34:04] statement in the queen of the south from
[1:34:07] 58 he says and Jesus in his teaching
[1:34:09] here he just had a lot of criticism and
[1:34:11] they had been talking about him as every
[1:34:13] time where the supernatural's done
[1:34:15] there's a mixed multitude when Moses did
[1:34:17] the supernatural a mixed multitude went
[1:34:19] with him and it caused trouble always
[1:34:21] when the supernatural done a mixed
[1:34:23] multitude go goes the Revival is going
[1:34:25] on now and there's a mixed multitude the
[1:34:28] historians said it wasn't a strange
[1:34:30] thing that Martin Luther could protest
[1:34:31] the Catholic church and get by with it
[1:34:33] but to keep his head above all the
[1:34:35] fanaticism that followed the
[1:34:38] Reformation so was Martin Luther a true
[1:34:42] Messenger from God is he one of the
[1:34:44] Seven
[1:34:46] Angels but all around Martin Luther in
[1:34:49] the Reformation were men who were
[1:34:51] Fanatics yeah
[1:34:54] zealots and all kinds of things and they
[1:34:57] were associated with him they were in
[1:34:59] the same circles they and and it wasn't
[1:35:02] that he could brother M said the
[1:35:03] historians say it wasn't that he could
[1:35:04] protest the Catholic church and get away
[1:35:06] with that it that he could keep his head
[1:35:07] above all the fanaticism that surrounded
[1:35:09] him if that's true then when you would
[1:35:12] look from the outside into the
[1:35:14] Reformation movement and you would see
[1:35:16] Martin Luther and you would see all the
[1:35:17] fanaticism surrounding him it would look
[1:35:20] like a great big old mess yeah
[1:35:23] and you could be on the outside
[1:35:25] criticizing but look at this and look at
[1:35:27] this and look at this amen but God
[1:35:29] wasn't looking at all of that that's
[1:35:30] always been there God was looking at the
[1:35:32] message Martin Luther was given to
[1:35:34] distribute and he was given that and the
[1:35:35] elect were going to catch it and the
[1:35:36] elect were going to move on in the
[1:35:38] middle of a whole bunch of trouble and a
[1:35:40] great big old mess of
[1:35:42] fanaticism amen amen there's listen
[1:35:46] there's a whole bunch of fanaticism that
[1:35:48] takes the name of the message and twist
[1:35:49] it into all kinds of stuff there could
[1:35:51] be a great big mess going on all around
[1:35:53] hey but that's what Martin Luther had to
[1:35:54] deal with that didn't deter God one drop
[1:35:57] that didn't stop the message from coming
[1:35:59] forth and that didn't stop the elect
[1:36:01] from hearing amen from that messenger
[1:36:03] and grabbing the truth of justification
[1:36:04] and moving on Amen just because there's
[1:36:07] fanaticism all around just because
[1:36:09] there's a great big old mess and and
[1:36:11] Martin Luther was in a whole big pile of
[1:36:14] trouble so
[1:36:17] what so
[1:36:20] what Paul was in a mess
[1:36:26] Jesus was in a
[1:36:28] mess you think there wasn't Fanatics
[1:36:30] Around
[1:36:31] Jesus they were trying to take him by
[1:36:34] force and make him a king to overthrow
[1:36:36] the Roman
[1:36:38] government what do you think the Romans
[1:36:40] thought when they heard
[1:36:42] that
[1:36:44] yeah we find the same thing in the
[1:36:47] message find the same thing all around
[1:36:49] us friends
[1:36:51] Amen brother brandham is preaching
[1:36:54] Revelation 5 this is 1961 this is June
[1:36:57] says after he's come through and he's
[1:36:59] preached the U revelation of Jesus
[1:37:01] Christ series which is the seven Church
[1:37:03] ages preached Revelation chapter 4 now
[1:37:05] he's getting into Revelation chapter 5
[1:37:07] but there's another title for this
[1:37:09] message and the other title for this
[1:37:10] message is called bruised
[1:37:12] serpent because brother Brenham has to
[1:37:14] deal with some fanaticism that's around
[1:37:17] him here's what he says I heard it a few
[1:37:20] more times but it wasn't so and the
[1:37:22] other day in can a brother showed me a
[1:37:24] little ticket of a thing he's packed in
[1:37:26] his pocket said William brandham is our
[1:37:29] Lord baptizing in the name of William
[1:37:34] brandham this is what he's dealing with
[1:37:36] in Bru
[1:37:37] serpent because they were baptizing in
[1:37:40] his name and saying he was the Lord
[1:37:42] Jesus
[1:37:44] Christ does that change the truth of the
[1:37:48] message does the fanaticism around
[1:37:51] Martin Luther change the truth of
[1:37:52] Luther's
[1:37:56] message does the trouble that surrounded
[1:37:59] Paul with these men from Jerusalem
[1:38:01] coming down and causing problems in all
[1:38:03] the church is the fact that the church
[1:38:05] that Paul established all broke up in
[1:38:07] factions I'm of Apollos and I'm a Paul
[1:38:09] does that change the truth of Paul's
[1:38:13] message doesn't change anything it's
[1:38:16] always been
[1:38:18] there brother bham comes down and he
[1:38:21] starts talking about these Brethren he
[1:38:23] said I had to deal with it years ago and
[1:38:25] I thought it was dealt with
[1:38:27] then and now it's come back up and he's
[1:38:30] contemplating leaving the field over
[1:38:32] such a lie and and and he's so upset and
[1:38:35] so troubled in this message and he comes
[1:38:37] a little further down he says I've
[1:38:38] wondered if I would have been some of
[1:38:40] mine enemies it would have been all
[1:38:43] right if it was his enemies who were
[1:38:45] baptizing in his name and calling
[1:38:47] William brandom Lord it would be all
[1:38:49] right
[1:38:54] he said but I would just have laughed at
[1:38:57] it and went on but when it come to being
[1:39:00] precious Brothers precious sisters then
[1:39:04] that's what hurt
[1:39:05] me these were some of his friends and
[1:39:08] some of the people that were closest to
[1:39:09] him in
[1:39:14] association and I said Lord that things
[1:39:17] too great for me I'll just have to walk
[1:39:18] out and leave it in your hands I don't
[1:39:20] know what else to do now listen to what
[1:39:22] he says
[1:39:24] a few nights ago to make it sure I had a
[1:39:26] visitation from the Lord and I seen a
[1:39:29] pre one a precious one one of those B
[1:39:32] brothers and sisters a precious one a
[1:39:34] babying a serpent which was yellow and
[1:39:37] black and telling me right along and the
[1:39:40] and the thing struck me on the leg so he
[1:39:42] see somebody babying a little serpent a
[1:39:45] yellow and black Serpent and that
[1:39:46] serpent bit him on the leg listen what
[1:39:48] he says and the thing struck me on the
[1:39:50] leg but the blood was so rich it didn't
[1:39:53] take effect on me and I looked down and
[1:39:57] there's where I had been bit
[1:40:01] before he just tells us earlier on that
[1:40:04] he had to deal with this before where
[1:40:06] they were trying to make him Jesus
[1:40:07] Christ so he had been bit by this snake
[1:40:10] before but he had thought he had dealt
[1:40:12] with it and now he looks down in the
[1:40:14] scenario is in and Bruce Serpent and
[1:40:16] this serpent bites him where he had been
[1:40:19] bit before but his blood was too strong
[1:40:23] which mean he wouldn't take the devil's
[1:40:26] bait the lie that he's Jesus Christ he
[1:40:28] resisted that lie amen so it bit him
[1:40:31] with the poison Venom of a lie trying to
[1:40:34] overinflate him and trying to make him
[1:40:36] Jesus Christ and all of these precious
[1:40:37] Saints and friends that were around him
[1:40:39] amen but his blood was too strong it
[1:40:41] couldn't take an effect but it bit him
[1:40:42] where he was bit before so this is the
[1:40:44] second time he's dealing with this he
[1:40:46] says and I turned quickly with a gun and
[1:40:49] I shot the thing and it hit right in the
[1:40:51] middle of the thing
[1:40:53] now this is something that's very
[1:40:55] interesting and I don't know for sure if
[1:40:56] this is true or not but I had a brother
[1:40:58] uh tell me who was familiar with this
[1:41:00] and he said there was Brethren up in
[1:41:02] Canada that were believing this and
[1:41:04] there was Brethren down in Georgia that
[1:41:06] were believing this and here's brother
[1:41:08] brandham in Jeffersonville which is in
[1:41:10] the middle and he shoots the thing in
[1:41:13] the middle which is what Bruce serpent
[1:41:15] is all
[1:41:16] about so he shoots the thing in the
[1:41:19] middle he said and a brother said I turn
[1:41:23] with my gun to shoot its head
[1:41:25] off and he said don't do that just pick
[1:41:29] up the stick laying there by you and
[1:41:31] when I turned my back to pick up the
[1:41:33] stick it wiggled into some water just a
[1:41:36] little small puddle of water I said Well
[1:41:38] it can't hurt very much longer now
[1:41:40] because I believe the brother realizes
[1:41:42] the Brethren that what would happen I
[1:41:44] said it's mortally wounded so it'll
[1:41:49] die so brother Ram's dealing with this
[1:41:51] deity Doctrine with he he's Jesus Christ
[1:41:54] and baptizing in his name and people
[1:41:55] wanted to worship and they were even
[1:41:57] finishing their prayers in the name of
[1:41:59] William brandham over their meals and
[1:42:01] things like that and here he comes he's
[1:42:04] so troubled to deal with it and God
[1:42:05] gives him this Vision showing this thing
[1:42:07] bit him where he'd been bitten before
[1:42:09] but the blood was strong he's not going
[1:42:10] to buy into that lie and he shoots it
[1:42:12] right in the middle and then he goes to
[1:42:14] shoot its head off to finish it off and
[1:42:17] a brother standing by says don't do that
[1:42:19] grab that stick when he turns to grab
[1:42:21] the stick the snake slithers off into a
[1:42:23] little pool of
[1:42:25] water and brother B says well it's
[1:42:27] mortally wounded it'll die but the Lord
[1:42:29] never told him
[1:42:31] that and went into a pool of water and
[1:42:33] in the Bible water represented people a
[1:42:36] little pool of water and we know that
[1:42:38] Spirit didn't die because it's still
[1:42:40] going on
[1:42:42] today somebody sent me a picture from
[1:42:45] overseas where there's a man in Africa
[1:42:47] bowing on his knees with his hands up to
[1:42:49] a picture of William brandham in a
[1:42:51] church
[1:42:53] he shot it in the middle but it
[1:42:55] slithered off he never saw it die and we
[1:42:57] see the effects of it going on
[1:43:00] now does that change the truth of the
[1:43:04] message in no way does it change does
[1:43:06] trouble does false Brethren does false
[1:43:09] Doctrine is it any different than what
[1:43:11] Paul dealt with no friends it was in
[1:43:16] Paul's Ministry it was in jesus'
[1:43:18] Ministry it was in brother Bam's
[1:43:20] Ministry and why do we think that we'll
[1:43:22] be suddenly be free from from
[1:43:26] it Brothers in the same message he comes
[1:43:29] down to the end of the message and
[1:43:30] listen closely to what he says because
[1:43:32] it had such impact on me he said then
[1:43:35] that brings me to think of 31 years will
[1:43:37] will be soon of Ministry for the Lord
[1:43:39] and I guess every man thinks of
[1:43:41] sometimes when he has to come to his
[1:43:42] last service and come to his last hour
[1:43:45] and look back down the path and see what
[1:43:47] has been accomplished see what's went on
[1:43:50] have you did anything have I just said
[1:43:52] it's it's what you do for others that
[1:43:54] counts I often wonder what would be when
[1:43:57] I got to the end of my road which we
[1:43:59] don't know what time that will be none
[1:44:02] of us so I was thinking about looking
[1:44:04] back down along the trail where I've
[1:44:06] come through life and seen the different
[1:44:08] Hills and Brier patches and rocks and
[1:44:11] hard places and smooth Runnings and what
[1:44:14] did I do what what I did in those kind
[1:44:18] of
[1:44:19] times what kind of times the hill
[1:44:24] the Brier patches the rocks the hard
[1:44:27] places and the smooth Runnings he was
[1:44:30] looking back over his life and said what
[1:44:31] did I do in those kind of
[1:44:34] times you know sometimes the worst times
[1:44:36] for a Christian is the smooth
[1:44:39] Runnings the most treacherous time he
[1:44:42] said it'll all show up one of these days
[1:44:44] at the hour of my going away and I'll do
[1:44:47] that on each it'll do that on each of us
[1:44:49] we will all be sure of that that it'll
[1:44:51] show up to each one when that time
[1:44:55] comes he says in the message possessing
[1:44:58] the enemy's Gates he says was a little
[1:45:00] year a few years later when the Trials
[1:45:02] come and the church got All Shook Up as
[1:45:05] it is so easy for a Congregation of
[1:45:07] people to do when something just don't
[1:45:09] seem to be to happen the way that it's
[1:45:11] supposed to be God makes it that
[1:45:14] way God brings tension into the church
[1:45:18] for every son that cometh to God must be
[1:45:20] tried and proven and tested he lets
[1:45:24] sickness strike you he lets disease come
[1:45:27] on you to test you and to prove you to
[1:45:28] show the world that you're truly the
[1:45:30] Seed of Abraham he permits it by his own
[1:45:33] will he permits disasters he permits the
[1:45:36] friends to turn against you he permits
[1:45:38] all these things and turns the devil
[1:45:40] loose to tempt you and he'll do all but
[1:45:42] take your life he could throw you on a
[1:45:44] bed of Affliction he could turn your
[1:45:46] neighbors against you he could turn the
[1:45:48] church against you he can do almost
[1:45:50] anything and it's God's will for him to
[1:45:52] do it we are taught that it's more
[1:45:54] precious than gold to
[1:45:56] US amen there's so many times when the
[1:45:59] when I read a quote from the prophet I
[1:46:01] say amen and I read one like this and
[1:46:03] it's like oh
[1:46:05] dear but it's just as true as the day
[1:46:08] Jesus sat and told his disciples you
[1:46:10] shall be hated by all men for my name's
[1:46:12] sake and you're going to be scorg and
[1:46:13] you're going to be in prison and
[1:46:15] father's going to turn against son and
[1:46:16] all it's just as true friends because
[1:46:19] God wants to prove amen what is he
[1:46:21] looking for Faith and amen what will
[1:46:23] overcome these obstacles
[1:46:25] Faith that's
[1:46:28] it let's go to James chapter
[1:46:42] 1 James chapter 1 verse
[1:46:48] 2 oh praise
[1:46:50] God James 1 vers
[1:46:53] two my
[1:46:55] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[1:47:00] into diverse
[1:47:02] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[1:47:05] of your faith worketh patience but let
[1:47:07] patience have her perfect work that you
[1:47:09] may be perfect and entire wanting
[1:47:17] nothing question is what do we want out
[1:47:19] of life do we want an easy life or do we
[1:47:22] want to come to adoption
[1:47:24] maturity it's going to take patience
[1:47:27] this word patience I told you earlier it
[1:47:30] means steadfastness constancy endurance
[1:47:33] another definition is a patient enduring
[1:47:36] a sustaining a
[1:47:38] perseverance he says count it all joy
[1:47:42] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[1:47:44] knowing this that the try of your faith
[1:47:46] worketh patience so Jesus told his
[1:47:49] disciples all of these things are going
[1:47:51] to happen to you but he that endureth to
[1:47:55] the end shall be saved so what's it
[1:47:57] going to take to make it to the goal
[1:48:00] it's going to take endurance so why
[1:48:02] should we count it all joy when we fall
[1:48:04] into diverse Temptations because the
[1:48:07] trying of our faith worketh endurance
[1:48:09] how do we get Endurance by the trying of
[1:48:12] our faith it teaches us to be patient to
[1:48:15] endure to just stay fast because amen
[1:48:18] it's all God working something in my
[1:48:20] life we'll get through this too amen
[1:48:23] amen and when the next one comes we'll
[1:48:24] get through this too amen I'm not
[1:48:26] derailed because there's trouble about
[1:48:27] I'm not derailed because of rejection or
[1:48:29] sickness I'm not derailed because of
[1:48:31] falling away I'm I'm not derailed by all
[1:48:34] of that but let me set my face on the
[1:48:35] joy that lays ahead this will end too
[1:48:38] but let me count this all joy because
[1:48:41] this is going to bring about the
[1:48:42] patience that I need to be saved because
[1:48:45] he that endureed to the end will be
[1:48:47] saved and we're not going to make it
[1:48:49] without endurance without patience and
[1:48:51] we're not going to get paid patience
[1:48:53] without
[1:48:55] trials cu the trying of our
[1:48:58] faith so maybe rather than to despair
[1:49:02] every time something should happen maybe
[1:49:04] we should say Praise Your Name Lord
[1:49:06] Jesus you're working something out of my
[1:49:09] life maybe the next time our heart is
[1:49:12] broken because of something somebody
[1:49:14] said to us or a circumstance that
[1:49:16] happened in family or happened in church
[1:49:18] or maybe we should just go amen just
[1:49:20] like Paul and stalks beating in naked in
[1:49:23] a prison cell and just start singing
[1:49:25] praises to God because he's good anyhow
[1:49:27] and this thing will work together for
[1:49:28] good cuz it's a promise in the
[1:49:31] scriptures maybe we could just change
[1:49:33] our attitude about troubles and
[1:49:35] disagreement and strife and sickness and
[1:49:39] trials and falling away and false
[1:49:41] Brethren and false Doctrine if we could
[1:49:43] just change our attitude maybe all of a
[1:49:45] sudden we would realize there's nothing
[1:49:47] to worry about because the destiny is
[1:49:49] still secure what is that to thee follow
[1:49:52] thou me me you say didn't you hear what
[1:49:54] they're preaching over in so and so City
[1:49:57] what's that to thee follow thou me
[1:49:59] didn't you hear there was a bunch of
[1:50:00] people that fell away because of a new
[1:50:02] internet not internet s what's that to
[1:50:04] thee follow thou me do you see that
[1:50:06] there's people bowing down and lighting
[1:50:08] candles and worshiping William brandom
[1:50:10] what's that to thee follow thou
[1:50:12] me it's nothing unusual in the
[1:50:15] scriptures it's nothing out of the
[1:50:17] ordinary wherever Christ was there's
[1:50:19] always been a big bunch of
[1:50:21] noise what does he you want me to
[1:50:23] do look to the glory that lays
[1:50:27] ahead and
[1:50:28] endure because he that endur to the end
[1:50:32] listen despising the shame do you think
[1:50:36] we like
[1:50:38] contention we all hate it you think we
[1:50:41] like it when Brothers Fall Away we hate
[1:50:43] it you think we like it that there's
[1:50:45] deception out there in the name of the
[1:50:47] message and there's false we hate but
[1:50:49] despising the
[1:50:51] shame we don't like
[1:50:53] it but we can't change
[1:50:56] it we don't want it we didn't ask for it
[1:51:00] but we can't make it go away the only
[1:51:03] thing I can do as one individual is
[1:51:06] press towards the mark of the high
[1:51:08] calling in Christ the only thing I can
[1:51:11] do is count it all
[1:51:14] joy when I hit diverse Temptations and
[1:51:18] trials for this is working what I need
[1:51:22] to make get to the
[1:51:24] end you know what we need to do
[1:51:27] sometimes sometimes we just need to act
[1:51:29] like a mule that's harnessed to a hitch
[1:51:31] and just put our head down and
[1:51:34] plow quit wishing it was over quit
[1:51:37] acting like it's unfair quit crying
[1:51:40] about how mean everything is and how
[1:51:42] horrible the world is maybe sometimes
[1:51:45] what we need to do is just drop our head
[1:51:47] and keep plotting along because if God
[1:51:49] hitched me to this wagon there's a
[1:51:51] purpose amen
[1:51:53] yes and if it's God's purpose I'm not
[1:51:55] going to go around it I'm not going to
[1:51:57] go under it I'm just going to go through
[1:51:59] it and the faster I start taking steps
[1:52:02] the faster this thing will be behind me
[1:52:05] yeah and we just need to say God you're
[1:52:09] everything to me this message is true
[1:52:12] whatever somebody else wants to do with
[1:52:14] it is fine I want everybody to believe
[1:52:17] it but one thing's for sure is I believe
[1:52:19] it I want everybody to walk closer to
[1:52:22] you but one thing's for sure I'm
[1:52:24] determined to give my life to you and
[1:52:27] let you live through
[1:52:29] me and one one area that I myself has
[1:52:32] failed in and I'm asking God to help
[1:52:36] me is when I find myself in stalks
[1:52:40] beaten and imprisoned I haven't been
[1:52:44] singing I've been
[1:52:46] crying I'm probably not the only
[1:52:50] one but you know what I want to start
[1:52:52] doing I'm going to start
[1:52:55] singing I'm going to start singing you
[1:52:58] alone are worthy amen of all the glory
[1:53:04] amen you alone are worthy of all our
[1:53:09] praise just because I'm having a bad day
[1:53:11] doesn't change how worthy you are Lord
[1:53:13] Jesus to be worshiped and adored just
[1:53:16] because my heart is hurting or my flesh
[1:53:18] is hurting just because my mind is
[1:53:20] confused and I'm discouraged doesn't
[1:53:23] ever diminish the fact that you're
[1:53:25] worthy of my praise and I want to count
[1:53:28] it all joy I want to be
[1:53:32] cheerful Jesus said in this life you
[1:53:34] shall have
[1:53:36] tribulation but be of good cheer I have
[1:53:39] overcome the world Amen oh Lord that's
[1:53:42] so true I'm having tribulation that part
[1:53:45] of the scripture is true let me make the
[1:53:47] rest of the scripture true I want to be
[1:53:49] of good cheer for he has overcome the
[1:53:51] world the circumstance you're going
[1:53:53] through he's already overcome it the
[1:53:55] trouble you're facing he's already
[1:53:56] overcome it what's coming next he's
[1:53:58] already overcome it this world is
[1:54:01] overcome and the new one is about ready
[1:54:03] to set
[1:54:04] in and that's the one we're looking
[1:54:07] towards brother B says in the message
[1:54:10] the world is falling
[1:54:11] apart he says in our political world
[1:54:14] today and our religious world is just
[1:54:16] exactly like it was in the days of the
[1:54:18] first coming of Messiah it's polluted
[1:54:20] the whole system is rotten our po
[1:54:22] politics couldn't get no worse in our
[1:54:24] religion I don't see how it could get
[1:54:25] any worse than what it is the whole
[1:54:28] thing is corrupted our political World
[1:54:30] man-made systems Fashions we want
[1:54:32] everything just everything so we can
[1:54:34] take it easy and retire and take life
[1:54:37] easy life wasn't intended to be
[1:54:41] easy life is a
[1:54:44] struggle anything that's got life is a
[1:54:46] struggling look at the trees how they
[1:54:48] struggle look at how everything that's
[1:54:50] got life it's a struggle and when we try
[1:54:51] to get some some kind of a system that
[1:54:53] takes it easy then we're
[1:54:57] wrong and we know that there's something
[1:54:59] wrong when we try to get a system that
[1:55:01] makes everything easy and everything
[1:55:02] perfect we're
[1:55:04] wrong and there we know there's
[1:55:07] something wrong because God never
[1:55:09] intended for this life to be easy what
[1:55:11] he wanted us here was to build character
[1:55:13] and become to grow into Christlike
[1:55:15] character and to display the divine
[1:55:18] nature thank God so now I I think the
[1:55:22] scariest times in life should be for us
[1:55:25] the easiest
[1:55:27] times and the times of rejoicing maybe
[1:55:30] should be some of the hardest times
[1:55:32] because we know God's working something
[1:55:33] in our Liv we got to lift our eyes just
[1:55:36] above amen that trial but move it up a
[1:55:39] little bit higher until we see the
[1:55:40] Promise that's behind the
[1:55:42] trials listen friends let's let's let
[1:55:45] the Millennium be more real to us than
[1:55:47] this
[1:55:48] earth when Jesus looked to the glory
[1:55:50] that lay ahead there was something he
[1:55:52] was looking at that was not natural eyes
[1:55:54] seeing the condition around him he was
[1:55:56] with spiritual eyes seeing something
[1:55:58] that you could not see on this Earth but
[1:56:00] what he was seeing amen gave him the
[1:56:03] courage and the joy Amen to endure the
[1:56:05] cross amen let's put our spiritual
[1:56:07] eyesight on and see more than what's
[1:56:09] going on around us but let's look to the
[1:56:12] revelation of what's coming and let that
[1:56:14] eyesight encourage us to step forward
[1:56:16] and be cheerful and be joyful and sing
[1:56:19] praises in the midst of our worst day
[1:56:21] because why I not looking to none of
[1:56:23] this all of this will perish he's
[1:56:25] overcome the world be of good cheer he's
[1:56:27] overcome it we're moving to the next one
[1:56:29] where he will be king of kings Lord of
[1:56:32] lords on the throne of
[1:56:34] David and all wrongs will be
[1:56:38] right let's go to Romans 8 I want to
[1:56:40] finish with this
[1:56:43] scripture in Romans 8
[1:56:52] Romans 8 and verse
[1:57:02] 35 who shall separate us from the love
[1:57:05] of Christ shall
[1:57:08] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:57:12] or famine or nakedness or Peril or
[1:57:18] sword listen how did this sentence start
[1:57:21] off
[1:57:23] who shall separate us from the
[1:57:25] love of
[1:57:28] Christ not who will separate us from
[1:57:30] Earthly Goods or from peace in our mind
[1:57:33] or from an Easy
[1:57:34] Living let's come back to what's the
[1:57:37] most important thing to us amen the love
[1:57:39] of Christ amen who shall separate us
[1:57:43] from the shall tribulation tribulation
[1:57:45] might separate you from mental
[1:57:48] ease but it won't separate you from the
[1:57:51] love of Christ am or distress or
[1:57:53] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:57:55] Peril or sword as is as it is written
[1:57:59] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[1:58:01] long we are counted as sheep for the
[1:58:02] slaughter nay in all these things we are
[1:58:05] more than conquerors through him that
[1:58:07] loved us for I am persuaded that neither
[1:58:09] death nor life nor angels nor
[1:58:12] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:58:15] present nor things to come nor height
[1:58:18] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:58:20] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:58:22] God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:58:26] lord nothing is going to hurt us friends
[1:58:30] amen because it can't separate us from
[1:58:31] his love and his love he's revealed to
[1:58:34] us his elective love and he's bringing
[1:58:36] us to that place yes in the flesh it can
[1:58:39] be difficult but oh praise God if we
[1:58:43] could just look at our trials
[1:58:45] differently if you could look at the
[1:58:47] difficult man at work that hates you
[1:58:49] differently amen and he's trying to
[1:58:51] disrupt everything you're trying to do
[1:58:53] and spread rumors about you and trying
[1:58:55] to derail you and make sure he gets the
[1:58:57] promotion and you don't get it and your
[1:58:58] reputation is is is slandered maybe we
[1:59:02] must look at that
[1:59:03] differently instead of God make him go
[1:59:07] away God maybe we should look at it and
[1:59:10] say praise God I have an opportunity to
[1:59:14] act like Jesus Christ now cuz without
[1:59:17] this man I wouldn't have this chance to
[1:59:19] display what's inside of me but this man
[1:59:21] is giving me the opportunity to forgive
[1:59:24] this man is giving me the opportunity to
[1:59:26] love this man is giving me the
[1:59:27] opportunity to be like Jesus on Calvary
[1:59:30] saying father forgive them they don't
[1:59:31] know what they're doing and without this
[1:59:33] man I don't have the opportunity praise
[1:59:35] God and let's start wrestling our flesh
[1:59:37] in the subjection and take great joy in
[1:59:40] the fact that I conquered this man not
[1:59:43] that man amen amen we're always trying
[1:59:46] to conquer the one that rejects us the
[1:59:48] one that doesn't like us the one with
[1:59:49] the false Doctrine or the one that
[1:59:51] spread rumors about us or or the or the
[1:59:54] one that made us whatever we're always
[1:59:56] fighting that man that's not the man to
[1:59:58] fight this is the man to fight and all
[2:00:00] them other men and women are giving us
[2:00:02] an opportunity to conquer this man to
[2:00:04] display Christ right and now count it
[2:00:07] all joy when you fall into diverse
[2:00:09] Temptations because now you have an
[2:00:11] opportunity to manifest what's
[2:00:14] inside and in those times that we
[2:00:17] manifest the wrong thing that old sticky
[2:00:19] cck bur nature it gives us an
[2:00:20] opportunity to lay that before God and
[2:00:22] say God take that thing out of my life
[2:00:24] that jealousy that self-preservation
[2:00:26] take it right out of my life because God
[2:00:28] I see you're giving me an opportunity I
[2:00:30] don't want to fail it but I only want
[2:00:31] you to be manifest in my
[2:00:35] life there's people who are
[2:00:39] Fanatics so what what's that to thee
[2:00:44] follow thou me there's people
[2:00:46] manipulating the truth of the message
[2:00:48] for the personal game so what what
[2:00:52] that's to thee there's people who may
[2:00:54] speak evil of you there's some maybe
[2:00:57] some people who don't like
[2:00:58] you praise
[2:01:01] God I'm
[2:01:03] thankful praise God why are we thankful
[2:01:06] because if God ordained that trial for
[2:01:08] me it's the best thing that he could do
[2:01:10] for me and if he wants to manifest
[2:01:13] something out of me that's what I want
[2:01:14] to live for anyways that he has control
[2:01:18] of
[2:01:19] me maybe just maybe
[2:01:22] we can start looking at our trials
[2:01:25] differently and maybe just maybe he can
[2:01:28] accomplish his purpose in our
[2:01:32] life
[2:01:34] amen how many see a book of Acts church
[2:01:37] a little differently
[2:01:40] now amen how many realize that listen
[2:01:46] God knows who's who and what's what and
[2:01:49] what he's doing with each we don't have
[2:01:52] to know and we don't have to pretend to
[2:01:54] know we don't have to make it up all
[2:01:56] we've got to do is
[2:01:58] surrender and sing his Praises
[2:02:02] regardless I want to next time I find
[2:02:04] myself
[2:02:06] prison not real prison but like the song
[2:02:09] says a prisoner in my
[2:02:11] mind because of the struggles and trials
[2:02:14] and things that are said and done and
[2:02:16] next time I find myself all locked in
[2:02:18] stocks and bound up emotionally and tied
[2:02:20] down on the inside
[2:02:22] you know what I want to desperately do I
[2:02:25] want to sing praises to his
[2:02:27] name because when they began to sing
[2:02:29] praises to his name the stocks
[2:02:33] unlocked you know what might get me out
[2:02:35] of my mental bondage the prison that I'm
[2:02:38] in my mind it might be the very fact
[2:02:40] that I quit looking at my circumstance
[2:02:42] and start looking at the one who's
[2:02:43] greater than my circumstance who has a
[2:02:46] purpose in it all and start singing
[2:02:47] praises to Him and maybe in my singing
[2:02:50] praises to him he'll take my mind out of
[2:02:52] the
[2:02:54] stalks and let me see how good my life
[2:02:57] is and how blessed I am how thankful I
[2:03:00] am for everything he's done for me and
[2:03:03] remind me of the joy that lays ahead
[2:03:08] amen let's all stand musicians if you'd
[2:03:10] please
[2:03:13] come so the next time you think we're
[2:03:16] going to have a book of Acts church you
[2:03:18] can say well praise God
[2:03:22] we've got to take the good and the bad
[2:03:24] amen
[2:03:26] amen and the next time you feel pressure
[2:03:29] to pretend that our church is
[2:03:33] perfect just remember we're not going to
[2:03:35] do any better than Paul we're not going
[2:03:38] to be better than brother brandham
[2:03:40] better than Moses better than Jesus we
[2:03:42] can't outdo them so the next time you
[2:03:45] feel that temptation to present your
[2:03:47] church as the perfect church just
[2:03:49] quit please let's just be real you say
[2:03:54] you know what we're a bunch of people
[2:03:55] with a bunch of problems that are
[2:03:57] looking to the glory that lays ahead
[2:03:59] amen that love this word and driving for
[2:04:02] it perfect absolutely not but none of
[2:04:04] them have
[2:04:05] been we we actually we might be a little
[2:04:08] bit like the church in the wilderness we
[2:04:10] might be a little bit like Jesus's
[2:04:12] church or Paul's church or brother
[2:04:13] brenham's
[2:04:15] church but praise God anyhow
[2:04:19] amen there was Believers there in
[2:04:22] anyhow I thank God I thank God for
[2:04:25] reality friends am now what's my
[2:04:29] goal my goal is just let this vessel be
[2:04:34] a Temple of
[2:04:36] Praise not to worry about what all is
[2:04:38] going on but just to trust him and
[2:04:42] follow him what he said to Peter I want
[2:04:45] to apply it to my life what's that to
[2:04:48] thee follow thou me and let's bow our
[2:04:51] head heads
[2:04:53] together dear Lord Jesus we thank you
[2:04:56] Father for your word is so good and so
[2:05:00] true and so
[2:05:02] rich God we've read over it so many
[2:05:05] times and so many times we read it we
[2:05:07] saw
[2:05:10] highlights
[2:05:12] successes saw Lord where your people
[2:05:18] overcame God it takes a few years of
[2:05:21] maturity to go back and read it again
[2:05:23] sometimes and see the circumstances that
[2:05:26] those overcoming came
[2:05:27] through the trials the difficulties the
[2:05:31] Mind battles the physical weariness the
[2:05:34] exhaustion the
[2:05:36] heartache but God you've been faithful
[2:05:38] through it all you never promised us a
[2:05:41] flowery bed of ease but you promised
[2:05:43] we'd have tribulation you promised
[2:05:46] rejection you promised trouble you
[2:05:49] showed us in every way that what what we
[2:05:51] experience is
[2:05:53] normal God I pray that your word would
[2:05:56] defeat Every Lie of the devil that's
[2:05:57] caused
[2:05:59] disappointment where people are
[2:06:00] discouraged and disappointed because
[2:06:03] they can see error and
[2:06:05] failure but oh
[2:06:07] God one thing for sure is I don't want
[2:06:11] you to be
[2:06:12] disappointed I want to be pleasing to
[2:06:14] you Lord I want to surrender my life
[2:06:18] aresh and God I want to have the
[2:06:20] perspective that Paul and Silas had I
[2:06:22] want to have the perspective that those
[2:06:24] disciples when they were beaten and
[2:06:26] charg not to preaching your name they
[2:06:28] ran out Lord they were happy rejoicing
[2:06:31] that they were counted worthy to suffer
[2:06:34] for your
[2:06:35] name and God may my trials not become my
[2:06:38] enemies but my trials become my
[2:06:40] friend the thing that pushes me to
[2:06:43] higher Heights that draws out of me
[2:06:45] deeper depths of your love and your
[2:06:48] character God may I not look Lord to the
[2:06:51] difficult ities and the circumstances of
[2:06:53] life as my enemy but may I look at them
[2:06:55] Lord as my helpers to help me manifest
[2:06:58] your
[2:06:59] life God may I change my attitude may I
[2:07:03] rejoice when I fall into diverse
[2:07:06] Temptations may I count it all joy Lord
[2:07:09] that my might inherit the promise May
[2:07:12] the scriptures that we read today become
[2:07:14] a living reality in US Lord that we
[2:07:16] would no longer be complainers and
[2:07:18] whiners and distraught and discouraged
[2:07:21] but may we be Overcomers by your grace
[2:07:23] may we recognize the power that you've
[2:07:25] given us of Revelation and understanding
[2:07:27] that our eyes can behold the truth and
[2:07:29] that you've opened to us the
[2:07:31] understanding of the next phase of the
[2:07:32] journey and for the glory that lays
[2:07:34] ahead we can endure our cross help us
[2:07:37] Lord God I pray that you be with your
[2:07:40] children you be with us as an assembly
[2:07:43] Lord that we wouldn't Lord have the
[2:07:45] wrong expectation of one another the
[2:07:48] wrong expectation of this Gathering or
[2:07:50] wrong expectation of the message as a
[2:07:52] whole and get discouraged and
[2:07:54] disappointed but may we have Lord open
[2:07:56] eyes to
[2:07:58] see God may we all Lord May each one of
[2:08:03] us have that individual commitment and
[2:08:06] walk to you that will give our lives to
[2:08:09] you that will focus on you and that will
