TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Oh, I'm waiting for the chariot to swing low and I'll step in on the cloud. I'll rise to heaven. When the saints go maring in. Oh, when the saints go marching in. Oh, when the saints go marching in. Oh Lord, I want to be in that number. When the saints go maring in, when they crown him king of kings. Oh, when they crown him king of kings. Oh Lord, I want to be in that number when they crown him king of kings. Oh, when they crown him Lord of all. Oh, when they crown him Lord of all. Lord, I want to be in that number. Oh, and they crown him. Lord of all. Oh, when the saints go marching in. Oh, when the saints go maring in. Oh Lord, I want to be in that number. When the saints go marching in, we're a band of Christian soldiers fighting Satan every day. We're standing up for Jesus while we're kneeling down to pray. If his precious blood has cleans you and wash your sins away that makes you a member of the blood washing. Praise God. I'm a member of the blood washed band. I've been washed in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb. I was bound by chains of sin till one day the master gave and made me a member of the blood wash. God's children are advancing, marching till we reach the gold. For the battle's almost over, and we'll soon be going home. I can hear the sound of angels as the saints go marching in. Singing praises to the captain of that blood wash band. Praise God. I'm a member of the blood wash band. I've been washed in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb. I was bound by Jesus till one day the master came and made me a member of the blood wash. Oh, praise God. I'm a member of the blood wash. I've been washed in the blood cleansing blood of the lamb. I was bound by Jesus till one day the master came and made me a member of the blood washed man. Oh, greater than all my sin, his love that still cleanses me. The grace that still sets me free to praise him. [Applause] I know that the blood of the light. I'm walking in newness of life. I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the lamb. As brother Chad comes with the prayer request, sing that again. Greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleanses me. The grace that still sets me free to praise him. [Music] I know the blood of life. I'm walking in newness of life and I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the lamb. Amen. God bless you all. We're going to let you have your seats for just a minute. Hey, it's good to be home. And if you once you hear about my journey, you'll know I'm happy to be home. Amen. We've had a little bit of a detour and roundabout way to get here, but we're here. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, it's good to see you all. Just want to say how much we appreciate you all praying for each one of us. Praying for David and I. Each one of you praying for us. We had a wonderful time. Good meetings. And so, we really appreciate that. Uh I've uh asked Brother Rich Cobb to take the service this evening for us. Originally, I wasn't going to. I caught wind that he was coming in town, but I thought, I'm just going to let brother Rich visit his family. He doesn't We don't have to tap on him every time he comes. Well, we tapped on him. Amen. So, so much for letting him off the hook and visit his family. But I was so thankful he was available. Amen. Uh some of you might have heard, but on the way out, we had a plane that broke down. Some mechanical failure on the plane and it couldn't fly and got delayed and delayed and delayed and we finally had to reroute. And I was supposed to fly in that night and minister there for brother Ed Hammermeister and we missed that and so he had to take his own service and and so uh we missed that but by the grace of God we made it there. Then we had wonderful time good services. We had uh uh four services there. They had a Friday night, a Saturday night, a Sunday morning and then uh Saturday morning men's breakfast. I've got some pictures. Could you pull that up, brother Sam? Here's a picture one of the brothers sent me from the back of Brother Eugene's church. This is probably an angle you've never seen before, but this is their church. It was full. They had some visitors there. Apparently, there was two weddings in town, two different weddings in town of the amongst the believers, so a lot of people were visiting, which made it nice. And then Saturday morning, we had a men's fellowship breakfast. And so, we spoke at that. And brother Eugene always has several brothers speak at that. And it's really a good time. I've been there several times and I really very much enjoy each time I get to go. And then I bumped into some of our friends there from India. These are some brothers from brother Rashan's church. On the far left, your far left is brother Enoch. This is brother Rashan's son. He's a student finishing up his studies in Vancouver. And these two other brothers on either side of me, uh, the one next to Enoch would be Brother Gurgen. And the one on the other side of me is Brother Pew. They're both missionaries that work out of brother Roshan's church and go out and spread the message, spread the gospel to all the outlying areas. And so we know them really well. We've visited with them, spent a lot of time with them when we were in India. And so it was great to bump into them again there at those meetings. So that was an extra bonus for us. So just wanted to say thank you once again for the prayers and it's always so good to go visit with the assembly up there. We've been there a few times and so there's such a familiar familiarness for me and them and we get along well and I always gain something every time I go is what I told them and I always gain something with my fellowship with brother Eugene. He's got such perspective and insight and I feel like I grow just in the fellowship. So it's always been beneficial. And brother David had a good time. My son David, he had a great time. He met some friends there. Some of their young people got to spend some time together. So his his overseas trip was magnificent. He actually had to go through customs. I mean it was out of this world. But we had a good time. But uh on the way back then we had the same thing. The plane broke down. Some I don't know what it is with us and breaking planes but they they couldn't fly them. This on the way back they actually had us on the plane went through deicing got to the runway and then they took us back. And so that created some problems and then delay after delay after delay. And then it delayed so far I knew I wasn't going to make my flight from Minneapolis home last night. And when I knew I couldn't get home, I looked at alternatives and I didn't even know if we'd be home for tonight. So that's when I called brother Rich and said, "Brother Rich," and he was so gracious to say, "Yeah, no problem, brother Chad." I don't know if he felt like no problem, but he told me no problem. And so I really appreciate that. And I know he had a busy weekend and he was up in Lraine ministering on Sunday uh for brother Nathaniel Saias. But I just felt like it worked out when when it didn't work out for me. I felt like God was working something out, you know, and so I just relaxed and asked him and he was gracious to do that and I appreciate him doing that. So it's good to have him and his family here. Say God bless you all and look forward to hearing what God has for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I had full intentions of preaching tonight, but God obviously had something else in mind. So, I'm excited to see what else God had in mind. Amen. So, I have a high expectation. Also want to say it's been good to have the Abbott family here. God bless you all. You guys are leaving tomorrow, right? Yeah. So, it's been good to have you. May God bless you as you go and thank you uh for the service on Wednesday. I enjoyed it with all the delays. I had time to watch the services, the service from Wednesday and brother gave service from Sunday and I enjoyed them all. I was even I had my little headphones in. And I was walking around the airport and I I I blurted out a few amens a couple times and got a few looks. You know, people are used to people walking around with headphones in their ears and they're used to them reacting, but they're not used to hearing amen. &gt;&gt; So, so we got got a little bit of a surprise look a time or two, but hey, sometimes you just can't help it. Amen. The amen comes from deep inside. So, thank you, brother Gabe, as well. We appreciate that. God is good, friends. And uh it's good to be home. &gt;&gt; Good to be home. We uh got stranded in Minneapolis. Had to spend the night there. Slept about 3 hours. Got up early this morning to come here. So I told my wife, I'm going to sit beside you and just pinch me if I my head slumps, you know. And so then I'll wake up and go, why are you pinching me? And you guys will you guys will all know what happened because that's what some of our children used to do to us. Amen. So, so God be praised. So, yeah, very happy to be here. Also, uh very happy to have brother Sam and Sister Emily Bartram. They're not sitting together, but but the newest Bartram couple. Amen. They're happy to have them back. And I know they were here Sunday, but I didn't have a chance to welcome him back myself. So, it's good to have them back. So, God bless them. Let's all stand together. I got one prayer request I'd like to read and then we'll pray. And and I don't know about you, but I do have an expectation. It's always good to be back home, back in the home church, back with the saints. And after God orchestrated everything that's been orchestrated, I don't believe anything happens without God knowing about it, without it serving God's purpose. So, I'm very excited to be in the service this evening. [Music] Lord, the mountain is steep. Still out my higher. With you next to me, I'll press on. Lord, the trials seem harder, but I know you, Father, and you'll never hear my side. The higher the mountain, the fairer the view, the higher the trial, the more I trust in you, the weaker I become, the more in you I'm strong. I know if I abide in you, you'll ever abide in me. [Music] Lord, my strength is failing and I am now praying that you would please show me your way. Lord, you're the answer. I see. Provision be mine. I ask for more faith to believe. The higher the mountain, the fairer the view, the higher the trial, the more I trust in you, the weaker I become, the more in you I'm strong. I know if I abide in you, you'll ever abide in me. [Music] Lord, I worship your name. I know I am loving but I give myself unto you Lord if I just let go and you have control. I know that I overcome. The higher the mountain, the fairer the view, the harder the trial, the more I trust in you, the weaker I become, the more in you I'm strong. And I know if I abide in you, you'll ever abide in me. [Music] The higher the mountain, the fairer the view, the harder the trial, the more I trust in you, the weaker I become, the more in you I'm strong. And I know if I abide in you, you'll ever abide in me. Sing verse one with us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, the mountain is steep, but still I'll climb higher. With you next to me, I press on. Lord, the trials seem harder, but I know you, Father, that you'll never hear my side. The higher the mountain, the fairer the view, the harder the trial, the more I trust in you, the weaker I become, the more in you I'm strong. And I know if I abide in you, you'll ever abide in me still. Lord, my strength is near failing and I am now praying your way. Oh, your answer I see. Your vision be mine. I ask for more faith to believe. The higher the mountain, the fairer the view, the harder the trial, the more I trust in you, the weaker I become. The more in you I'm strong [Music] and I know if I abide in you, you'll ever abide in me. Verse three, Lord, I worship your name. I know I am nothing, but I give myself unto you. Lord, if I just let go and you have control, I know that I overcome. The higher the mountain, the fairer the view, the harder the trial, the more I trust in you, the weaker I become, the more in you I'm strong. And I know if I abide in you, you'll ever abide in me. Let's sing that chorus one more time. Oh, the higher the mountain, the fairer the view, the harder the trial, the more I trust in you, the weaker I become, the more in you I'm strong. And I know if I abide in you, you'll ever abide in me. blessing and honor, gloryy and power, riches and wisdom and strength. Oh, blessing and honor, gloryy and power, riches and wisdom and strength be onto you. [Music] Oh, unto you who sits at the right hand of God. Be unto you. [Music] unto you [Music] who sits at the right hand of God unto you. Let's all stand. Father Richard would come. Oh blessing and honor, glory and power, riches and wisdom and strength. Blessing and honor, glory and power, riches and wisdom and strength be onto you. unto you [Music] who sits at the right hand of God. Be unto you. Oh, unto you. who sits at the right hand of God. Unto you, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. We're so grateful that you're here tonight. Lord, we're here. So that means you're here, Lord God. That means that your angels are here as well because they're here to protect those that will inherit eternal life. And so God, your presence surrounds all of us right now, Lord. God, it's the reality of the word that we read, Lord, is here, Lord. And so, thank you, Lord Jesus. We bless your holy name. And God, we're just grateful for each one, Lord. We want your seeds of the word to be planted and fertilized, watered, Lord, and let somebody get the increase, Lord. And Lord Jesus, we just we thank you that you sent your word and you healed us and delivered us from all of our destructions. Nothing will separate us from you, Lord Jesus. God, we are a fruitful bride, Lord of the Word, manifesting ourselves through because of you, Lord Jesus. And we say thank you, Lord God. Who shall separate us from the love of God? No one. And so we say thank you, Lord. We ask you to have your way in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Maybe that song, have your way. and way [Music] have your way. Holy Spirit, fill my heart and have your name. Hallelujah. Oh, as we wait, [Music] as we pray, speak your word into our hearts and have your way. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what we want. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to be here tonight. Praise the Lord. Thank you. I guess I have control of that. Yes, I do. Praise the Lord. I'm always nervous when I see a new device. Hallelujah. God's so good. And we had such a good weekend and then a good Monday in Amish country. and and then we met the Abbotts. We still had a good time. Amen. So, we were about ready to part ways and said, "Well, I hope I see you again." I said, "Yeah, we'll be there Wednesday night." And he goes, "Yeah." He goes, "Brother Cha probably give you the nod." And I'm going, I said, "No way. I'm no way. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna sit and relax." And so we're we're almost back to line at about 6:15 and and all of a sudden the the the screen on the car lights up and it's like and it was brother Chad. It was like and one of the first things I asked him did did brother Simon talk to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's good. &gt;&gt; He knows all things. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we just greet you in the name of the Lord. Silas and had to go back for work and so the rest of the family's here and we're just happy to be here. And so tonight we want to talk about it's according to his word, not our reasoning. &gt;&gt; We have no thought coming whatsoever. &gt;&gt; And so he sent his word and healed us. So we should be healed. Amen. Spiritually, physically, financially, everything. And so let's go to the word. 2 Corinthians 10 4-5. 2 Corinthians 10. Actually, let's read 3-5. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. Really, brother? Amen. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. Got to get out of that old Pentecostal denominational thinking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exaltth itself against the knowledge of God. Not intellectual, but the knowledge. You know it, and you have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. Lord Jesus, we ask you to have your way like the song said, may the Holy Spirit be preeminent tonight. And may you discern my heart, our thoughts, our ways tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You may be seated. And so I put the amplified in there and you'll see why there's a grizzly in the background in a few minutes. So, but for the weapons of our warfare are not physical. And so where does the devil want us to fight our battles? &gt;&gt; In the flesh and our emotions. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's not where it happens. Amen. weapons of our for the weapons of our warfare are not physical weapons of flesh and blood, but they are mighty before God for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds. What did Jesus say to Pilate? If this were my kingdom, my people would fight. Right? And so, he's saying, if if I if I wanted a fleshly fight, bring it on because I'm going to win. Right? But that's not the fight that he wanted to have. He wanted that. He wanted God to speak and to bring his word to pass in his life because it's a spiritual warfare. Amen. And he stood the test. Praise the Lord. In as much as we refute arguments and theories and reasonings and every proud and loftly thing that self sets itself up against the true knowledge of God and we lead every thought and purpose away captive into the obedience of Christ. Amen. And so you take that thought, you put them under your arm and you lead him away and then you kick him out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so but here's Leadya. Brother, that's hard. Amen. Well, training is hard, right? &gt;&gt; Uh it's it's we have to fight the good fight of faith. This is a hard life. And so, the more that God reveals to you, the more he wants to show his love for you, he gives you more trials. It's hard. It's tough. Amen. But we've already won the battle. Amen. And so there's there's a lot of things where where we try to take it upon oursel when God's saying, "No, give it back to me." Amen. The other morning, uh, Silas got up and was on his way to work and and he took some pictures of the the tires on the front of our van. And they were they the the metal was showing through. And I've never ever had that happen before. And I was like, "What in the world?" And so I was sitting there, Lord, I said, "How are we going to how are we going to pay for that?" But I I got up and in my prayer time, I said, "Lord Jesus, you knew this before the foundation of the world." And Lord God, I know that you are the provider. So I'm going to I'm going to go to Costco. I'm going to get these tires put on and I'm going to go get an alignment. And I say, "Blessed be the name of the Lord. You're the provider." &gt;&gt; Didn't know where it was coming from. And so preached on testified a little bit on Wednesday night about it and then by Saturday um we have that on our mail system where you can see what you're getting before and it's like oh I don't recognize that that letter head. And so we get out there open up a letter and it had $300 for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Towards those tires. &gt;&gt; And I'm just saying God you are so good to us. And you say, "But brother, that did that touched a third of it." I don't care. &gt;&gt; It was the side the cloud the size of a man's hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just Oh, I just rejoice and we were so happy. Amen. And so God is so good to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to look for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; As a son or a daughter, God, you have to look for it. And the more and more he grows you, then the thoughts and intents of your heart begin to literally manifest in front of you. Amen. What whatever it may be, Amen. that you have a need of then. And and it's even if you say, "Lord, you know, I'd like to have that so I can do this around the house." Amen. Here comes something. Uh our our church house that we have, uh we needed a dishwasher in there. And and so Silas went to work and told his boss and said, "This is what I'm looking for." And so it's been about 8 months or 9 months. And the other day he his his boss said, "Are you still looking for for a dishwasher?" And he goes, "Yeah, a white Bosch." And he goes, "Okay, we'll we'll keep our eyes out." And and so he goes to walk out of the office. Here comes another uh person coming in and he goes, "Silus," he goes he goes, "I want to show you what I got." He goes, "It was a really hard uh extrication and install, but you know what?" He he goes, "Look at this. It's a white Bosch." &gt;&gt; Five minutes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so he goes to his boss and his boss says, "You know what? That's for your church house. You can have it." &gt;&gt; Because they re it was so nice they'd resell it for, I don't know, five, six, $700. &gt;&gt; And so he gave him that. And you know people say yeah I don't know coincidence. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Hallelujah. I know that he knows the thoughts and intents of our heart. And that's why we must begin to think like that. We must begin to fight our battles with the word of God and then let God do it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we see that the weapons of our warfare, they're not in us. It's not us. It's not our strength. It's not our intellect. It it's none of that. But it's it's because the word has been restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, we come out of Pentecost denominational back in the early days. And so, you know, everybody's just, you know, the the harder, you know, the the more power would come when you scream and yell, right? And when you're just get that and he said, "And he's going to be here." You know, that that really brings the presence of God, right? Amen. And and they were sincere. We know that, right? And so we're not making fun that way. We're not blasphemy, but but it's we've turned a corner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, all the signs and wonders and miracles are still happening in the life of of of the bride of Jesus Christ. It's it's a it's not a public show anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But brother, you know, when I come, I kind of want to get that feeling going. And it's like, well, Amen. You know, it's your job to come already with the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then you pull on these people, right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so, because God sent his restored word for the day, it has now become our absolute. &gt;&gt; It it's it's our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This word is my life. Is our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever it says, I have a desire to do it. And so because it's become the absolute, the devil will do all he can to get the people to think that the word is less in authority than it really is. &gt;&gt; He'll say, "Go ahead. Go to your message church. Believe for this. Agree with this." But when it comes down to the greatest battle you've ever thought, I really, you know, maybe not. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God's already said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you've been through one of your greatest battles that you've ever fought, you'll know that the devil's a liar. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that every word is true. And so, what does the devil want to do? He wants to present this message of the hour in a false light. &gt;&gt; And so, he wants to attract the attention of the people. Amen. to the leadership of his ways. And you know, he says, you know, it's been a long road, hasn't it, little bride? It's been so long. Yes. Yes, it has. And you know, do you see a lot going on? And you know, she might say, "Well, I don't see a lot." Well, you know what? Maybe we need to kind of go back. &gt;&gt; Maybe we need to go back and kind of inject some life. And where are they going back to? &gt;&gt; The first part of this age &gt;&gt; instead of all the way back. But you know, for you and I, we're saying devil, that's good. You're a liar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because everything that that word has said to me, it's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it comes to pass exactly the way that word says. Amen. And so I if you're I if that's why it's so important when you're when you're not married yet to receive the Holy Ghost so that that desire in you is only for the word because if you don't uh you'll last maybe two years. &gt;&gt; I've seen it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But with the Holy Ghost, you'll last into &gt;&gt; youth on the other side. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so the the devil wants to bring a false light to attract your attention so that he receives worship. What did brother Brandham say when he he he was behind the curtains listening to the supposed worship in the service? He sat there and cry and he says they don't know that they're worshiping the devil. Amen. Hallelujah. And so the the Holy Spirit, he's here. Amen. and and he's he's already working in us and and all it takes is our faith in that word by the Holy Ghost to set it on fire. Amen. Hallelujah. You have to have a a spark to to get a fire going like the old song says. Amen. I was a firefighter too long. Amen. The old joke is, well, it was a mouse playing with matches. No, probably more than that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But so the devil receives, he wants to receive the worship and he's going to fight that. That's why we're in the age of the razor's edge. Amen. And so when God wanted to speak, let's look backwards into the Old Testament. When God wanted to speak to Elijah at the cave, God showed up in a great and a visible way. Amen. &gt;&gt; With the earthquake, the great wind, and the fire. Amen. And you know what? Elijah wasn't unfamiliar with that. And he's probably going, "Pretty good, God. Oo, yes. Look at the rocks fly on that one." Amen. But that wasn't what he was looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so that's the way with a married couple. You're not really looking for all the fluff. Amen. You're you're looking for that that I love you and with that look on her face or your face that you know that you know that you know. Amen. So he was looking for a still small voice. Amen. That spoke to him. That's why he only came out for that. And that's why the bride of Jesus Christ today is not pulled over here in emotionalism or pulled over here in intellectualism, but she's right in the middle saying, "I'm here, Lord. I'm listening for your word. Amen. This word. This is the scriptures revealed. Amen. And that's when I mention the word, I'm speaking about this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so I it's always been for the religious that those scriptures that are revealed are the hardest thing for people to hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so you preach on the word and then people go, "Yeah, yeah, I believe it. I got it." And then they go out and live opposite. And it's like, no, you don't understand. You don't have it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to surrender to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the young people are watching you. &gt;&gt; And and everything you do, they're going to they're going to pick it up and say, "Oh, well, that must be fine because brother so and so and sister so and so does it." Amen. But see, we're we're in a we've turned a corner. And so as we've turned this corner to a life of the word, then the young people must see a life in the parents, the grandparents, amen, so that they can know and emulate the the behaviors, amen, of the Holy Ghost until they get their own. Praise the Lord. Because it's hard to hear that. Brother Ram speaks about it over and over. It It's so hard to receive God in simplicity. It was hard for the Philistines to comprehend Samson who was a little shrimp. It was hard for the Pharisees to look at Jesus who was a little guy. It was hard for denominations to look at brother Brandon with his education. And it's hard today in the message community to accept a bride who is in the word and the word only. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He is a living God tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't convince me otherwise. Amen. Hallelujah. Every word. And so God in simplicity and revealing himself in the same. And so that's what the devil wants people to stay away from is God in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Amen. They they want you to come and try to get healed of sicknesses and things be and when you haven't asked for forgiveness of your sin &gt;&gt; and you're still disliking or have funny feelings towards other people. Yeah. He loves that because it discourages you when nothing happens because the word says it that faith works by love and forgiveness. And you do that and it's thus sayeth the Lord right there &gt;&gt; or in your seat, right? Amen. And so that's what he wants. And so he he's revealing himself in the same and that's what the devil wants God's people to stay away from when when they're hearing from God. He wants them to all of a sudden just start, you know, oh glory, glory. I've seen it over and over. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. Even in message churches supposedly prophesying, thus sayeth the Lord, thus sayeth the Lord, thus sayeth the Lord. That's not that that's that's a good person who's gotten caught up in an emotion. And so, Brother Brandham says that you should come to him sely and calmly. Amen. Are you going to be crying? Absolutely. Amen. Are you going to be balling sometimes? Absolutely. But you are coming and he says you're making a decision for Christ with a sane and a sound mind. Amen. And that is completely against everything this world teaches. Hallelujah. But that's what God wants us is to be able to make that our calling and our election. Sure. And so the devil wants you and I to see this word in the light of the cosmos, &gt;&gt; in the light of a non-biblical teaching, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Who said that you when you receive the Holy Ghost that you have to do it a certain way? Who says that you have to be healed by the laying on of hands? Amen. That's biblical. Yes. But who says that? Amen. That's a denominational person who wants to receive all the glory. Amen. We are in a different light. We've turned a corner into the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But he says, don't don't view it in the light of today. His light is his life. His life is his light. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's so good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Romans 13:12, the night is far spent. The day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light. Amen. He says to walk in the light as we are in the light. Pentecostalism is not the light of today. Amen. God has built all the necessary things. Now we're here as a fully mature bride of Jesus Christ walking in the word of God being victorious over the person shaking their hand at you at the stoplight. Amen. Hallelujah. You're being victorious. Oh, I thought I was doing such a good deed the other day. Walked out in the parking lot of Costco and there's a big uh package of of paper plates. And it's like we needed those. And I said, "You know what? I'm going to take those back in. They're going to say, you just go ahead and take them." So I walk back in and I say, "Hey, I found these in the parking lot." He goes, "Oh, thank you. He goes, "See you later." And I got to thinking, "Lord, forgive me. I don't have to be rewarded every time I do something good." Right? Oh, but see, God has different plans for us. And he provides in different ways than what we think. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh John 12 and 46, it says, "I am I am come as a light that whosoever believeth in me should not abide in darkness." Amen. The five-fold ministry with the Holy Ghost comes as a light. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride of Jesus Christ is here as a light. Amen. Not somebody sitting in church just to be in church. Amen. But you you witness with your life. You witness with your word sometimes. But people see the light of your life. Amen. And that's what God has designed. Again, it's not according to what we think. It's what he his word has already said. Praise the Lord Jesus. And so the religious in the days of Jesus flesh, they had the scriptures &gt;&gt; just as we do today. But they couldn't receive the light of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Many people can receive the knowledge of the scripture. But did they receive the light of the scripture? And so that that old devil, he desires you and I to accept in our mind that you know God is good all the time, isn't he? &gt;&gt; But you know, is he really going to bring you to full maturity all the way? Is he really going to do it? Is he really going to bring you to a full maturity, a real birth? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he wants you to believe most of it, but he wants there to be doubt in that little last part. Amen. That comes with some of those greatest battles you'll ever fight. Amen. And so he he he wants you to keep have that little bit saying, "I don't know, you know, uh my husband was saved from drugs and alcohol, but in in the pressure of this time, honey, are you really going to hold?" Uh yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because it was him who started the work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, how can God take back his life when he's already given it to you? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. And so, the devil wants us to think that all that God has given you somehow is still controlled from this dimension. &gt;&gt; Rubbish. &gt;&gt; This flesh does not control God. Your spirit realm does not control God and his word. Amen. It is not controlled in this. We we gain wisdom or we gain character in this dimension, but this has no control of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so he's saying, but you know, your flesh and you know, you've been praying for this a long time and and you're saying, "Yeah, yeah, I know. But my husband says, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at my flesh. I'm not looking at my emotions." Hallelujah. Amen. I'm looking at it all. He's promised to give all to me. All things. Amen. Praise the Lord. And so tonight, who, what, where, and when is your giant, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Does it seem impossible? And we should not be sitting there going, "Yes, brother. It seems impossible. No, we're we've turned a corner, remember? &gt;&gt; And it should be. Yes, brother. It has been a hard and a battle and it's been a struggle and and sometimes I just feel like thrown in the towel. But greater is he that is in me than he that's in this world. My God is greater today than than when I I was first first came to him. He is more wonderful today. Amen. Amen. That's where it is. The giant. Who is the giant? The giant's already dead in the sight of God. The giant was already dead. Amen. In the mind and the vision of of David. Praise the Lord. Because he was already dead in the vision of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. And so when brother Random went to British Columbia for that hunting trip, the Lord already showed him in a vision &gt;&gt; that he would get a caribou with 42in rack and a silver tip grizzly. &gt;&gt; And so the word was already given. You're saying, "Praise the Lord, brother. That's right, brother Bradam." Oh, he just he just went up there. Boom and boom. No, no. The word had been spoken. Not one, not one time did the vision fail. &gt;&gt; Just like the word for the day. &gt;&gt; This word has never failed. &gt;&gt; It is always always victorious in what it says. Never failed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you might be saying, "Well, brother, I prayed about this." You know what? It's usually us. It's not the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that word was spoken. It is never wrong. And that vision cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like look at Elijah in the cave. Already knew what God was like. Already knew the visions. Already knew the word of the Lord. But he knew that they could not fail. Amen. But he must hear the voice of God before he goes and speaks it out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Today we must know what the word of God says before we go to speak it out. Amen. Because that's our lifeline right there. Praise the Lord. And so the guide who was with brother Brandham began telling him that, "Oh, brother, I've grown up here all my life. I've hunted here and I I I've guided here and there's never ever been a grizzly bear here. &gt;&gt; Wow. What an encouragement, right? &gt;&gt; And brother Brown said the devil was trying to get him to think he misunderstood the vision. And that's exactly what he does to you and I when we prayed about something and it doesn't happen quick. We say, "Well, did did I do this? Did I do this?" or you know maybe healing is is not for me or you know God doesn't answers everybody everybody's prayer look at Paul no your your job is to prepare yourself apply the word and go believing &gt;&gt; amen that's what God wants from us &gt;&gt; and so the the guide the devil was using the guide to try to discourage and make him think he misunderstood it but the guide he agreed God was the healer because his brother was healed. &gt;&gt; But this was this was impossible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you know, God can heal, but when it comes to the impossible, oh, I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; He was manifesting doubt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so, see, the devil likes to come to our marriages, to our health, our careers, everything we do as humans. And he wants to say ultimately, it's still under my control. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's a bluff, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything you do is really under my control. Because God really cannot truly control these things through his word. He just can't. It's too simple, brother Gabe. It's too simple, right? He He can't do it. You're going to be in that condition the rest of your life. I'm sorry. No. &gt;&gt; No. You You are already in the spirit realm in the condition of what the word has said. &gt;&gt; You're living and going to church today because you're in the condition of what the word has already spoke. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we may not speak that out, but that's the feelings that the devil tries to pour in there. &gt;&gt; Lord, I've lived this so long. Is it really going to happen? And he said, "Don't say those words. Please don't don't hurt me." &gt;&gt; That hurts God when we doubt him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He sent his word and healed us and delivered us from all of our destructions. And so the devil wants us to believe that everything the word is telling us that the Lord said he controls somehow is really controlled in this old carcass. Amen. And and he'll make sure that there's people around you. Well, brother, sister, I've Hey, I believe God's a healer, right? But I've never seen him heal that. &gt;&gt; Kind of like mental retardation. That's hard for people to think that God can heal. But just listen to the tapes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God heals that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God heals cancer. We we have a family that has a friend who who had cancer and they had her at the house and and this this woman that had the cancer was a registered nurse and and she had taken care of charity when she was in the hospital and another sister at the church when she was in the hospital. And so she'd done a lot of good things for the bride. And so her husband was there with her at our friend's house and and so they asked could we come and pray for him. So at communion that Sunday, we took a prayer cloth, we all prayed over it, went there to the house and and they're they're of another flavor of religion that you know may not really believe about healing. And so we talked about taking the the things from the aprons from the body of Paul and and everything else about laying on of hands. Amen. And so we began to pray and the presence of God just came down mightily. And one of the brothers looked at me and says, "He's here." I said, "Yeah, I know." But here's the lesson. That's good. And you're going to say, "Brother, you're really going to say this?" Yeah, I'm going to say this. This is greater than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I enjoy that. Don't we enjoy those times? &gt;&gt; We're nothing against that. &gt;&gt; But I want people to see this was the absolute of why she's now cancer free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stage four cancer gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The husband was kind of lary of me at first and afterwards I go to shake his hand. He goes, "Come here." And we're so fat. I was just like, "Come here." Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was his word that did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And so it's uh they say or you know maybe it's not meant for you. &gt;&gt; You know that's the other thing when but here's the thing. When God showed it to you as a believer in the word it is for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God wants you to go confessing it as yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when when God began to deal with me about the fire service before I got saved, I I I just started as a volunteer firefighter and this uh firefighter came through my check stand. I was I was doing retail and and I seen he had a certain shirt on. I go, "Oh, I I'm a volunteer. You know how you're so giddy?" And he's probably going, "Oo, another another volunteer, right?" And and so so he goes, "Well, how old are you?" And I told him, he goes, "Nah, forget it. You're too old." I was like, "30." And he goes, "You need to think about something else." But why did he say that? Because God had already placed the vision in my heart, even unconverted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And inside of me, it was like, "Uh, listen, buddy. You're way older than I am, but you know what? I'm not even going to listen to you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the vision says, "I'm a firefighter." &gt;&gt; And it manifested, right? &gt;&gt; And God used it for the church and for ministry. And so that that's why when the devil comes through other people or thoughts in your in your mind then you can say no I have a vision of the word already and it already says this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. And so the the devil can tell you that your life must have a just a little bit of the cosmos to be normal for people to accept you. It's like I'm not here to be accepted. That's the beauty of getting older. You just don't care. Amen. But but it is it's true. You I'm not here to be accepted. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not there at work when I was working to be accepted. Amen. I'm there to preach the truth. Somebody was at the table one day making fun of speaking in tongues. So I went around and he was a higher rank than I. And I said, "You shouldn't have said that." I said, "I'm not mad at you, but here's the truth." And he got so scared thought I was going to write him up, right? And but no, I But you got to stand for things sometimes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he wants to say, "Well, you got to look like a little bit like the modern church." And and that's that was the trouble with the two little brides in the back. Remember, &gt;&gt; they had their eyes on &gt;&gt; the nominal church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yet, but the devil doesn't understand that your word is that his word in you. That's normal. My normal is this. Your normal is this. This leads and guides and takes care of us no matter what situation you are in. Praise be to God. And so, Brother Brandham and the guide, they got the 42-in caribou. And just like the vision said, but now the test, now they had to start down the mountain where bears don't naturally live. How would you like to be in that situation? &gt;&gt; Amen. Even before the trip started, Brother Brandham says, "Does anyone have a checkered shirt?" All the brothers are going, "Nope. &gt;&gt; Nobody has it." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you got that. He see the devil's trying to make him doubt, right? &gt;&gt; And so, but he says, you know, in the vision, it showed somebody with small hands measuring the rack with a with a a checkered shirt. But see, the guide that was with him was not really believing. And when you don't believe, you begin to state the obvious. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You've been in that wheelchair a long time. &gt;&gt; But what did Brother Brown say? If you stay in that wheelchair, you're going to die. He goes, "If I was you, I would get up." &gt;&gt; Well, brother, what would that do? You're throwing the rock in the air. Amen. Hallelujah. If you stay there and and you don't let God do something in your finances, you will die. do something that the word says. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So even before that, the the discouragement was trying to come. But the the the guide began to state the natural laws. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what governs what we do out here is this. It's the terrain because at different levels of terrain, different animals live. That's natural law. But God's not governed by natural law. &gt;&gt; He's governed by the word of God. And so whatever you're going through, whatever your business is going through, whatever your relationships are going through, Amen. We we are not governed by what Dr. Phil or whoever it is these days says. Amen. We're we're not governed by by the the the finance guru. Amen. Though he has good stuff, but but we're not governed by that. I'm not governed by the little bit of retirement that I got from the fire department. I don't depend upon that. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Yeah, you can say that. I I mean it. &gt;&gt; Who put me into that job? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not me. &gt;&gt; Who gave me that? Not me. &gt;&gt; Who is answering prayers? Not me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's him. Praise the Lord. Whatever God wants, he will provide for it. I've seen it over and over and over. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so God is governed by his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can see it in the life of Jesus Christ when you apply faith into it. And so someone says, "Oh, you have this disease. You have this sickness. You have this financial difficulty. You're going to have to take these herbs. I'm sorry. You're going to have to drink this non juice or whatever. Amen. You know that that'll help. And you know what? You're going to have to you're going to have to make your will out. You know, everything is they're they're Job's helpers. Everything is pulled down into the natural. &gt;&gt; It's they're not lifting you up into the what the word of God says. Amen. And so, last time I checked, we're sons and we're daughters of God. &gt;&gt; And so, sickness, those type of things, difficulties, when we look at the word, we say, "Husband, what have you said about my situation? &gt;&gt; What am I going to do about this, husband?" Amen. Before I proceed anywhere or with anything, what have you said? And he says, "Okay, turn to this chapter, this verse." Amen. Praise the Lord. And I will tell you what to do. Amen. And so, here's a quote. And for three miles right down, there's not even a bush 4 in high, nothing but caribou moss, a few bberries, and they only get two or three inches high. He said, "Caribu moss. Blueberries." Hm. Plum down to the timberline. and our horses are hitched down there at the timber line. And now, according to what you've told me before we ca come here, that somewhere between here and where that boy standing with the checkered shirt, you're still going to kill a 9 foot grizzly. And so that's the devil for you, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. You mean to tell me that God has saved you from drugs and alcohol and that you're never going back? Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You mean that God has changed you so much that you you won't even fall to this? &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; That That's right, devil. Good. You're getting the picture, right? Amen. But brother Brandham, he he he had to stand there with the word already given to him. Amen. And tell him, bud, that's thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. Somebody comes to you with an issue and you said, "Well, it's it's already thus sayeth the Lord." I I people, they hate it when you say that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When you're preaching sometimes, &gt;&gt; you know why they hate it? Because they don't believe it. And when you say thus sayeth the Lord, that puts them in a corner. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're not putting them, you're putting the devil that's anointing them into a corner. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Your life tonight is thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I don't know how it's going to be, but it's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; That that's what the revelation of this day has done to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram said it's caused us to believe that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. We got to stop thinking all the time about signs and wonders and miracles. Amen. It's your everyday life with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so God's waiting for us just to come to his word. He's saying, "Honey, I just I just want you to believe me. &gt;&gt; That's all." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we go, "Have you told it to me before?" He goes, "Yeah, but here, I'll show you again." Oh, &gt;&gt; praise God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for having mercy. And so, when Satan is trying to get us to take his reasoning and things, that's when it's a good time to restate out loud what the word says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the devil can't read your mind. But when you need encouragement, say, "Lord, I thank you so much that you have healed my sickness. You have healed my this this depressive spirit. That is a lie. It's a bluff. You have healed this anxiety. It's a lie. It's a bluff. Amen. Hallelujah. And so God is in the business of manifesting himself in a still small voice. Brother Gabe was at our at our church at the beginning of the year and he was ministering and he was speaking on something and I'm I'm sitting there thinking, "Oh, that's what I have. That's what that's that's what that's what this issue is." And and so I'm talking to God. I said, "Lord, I don't want that. you know that I just want I want you to have your way and and cause me to respond correctly and cause me just to to be what you want me to be. Lord, please take it in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; It was gone. &gt;&gt; And it hasn't been back. &gt;&gt; But see, what do we want to do? We want to go up and brother, lay hands on me. Cast that demon out. No, &gt;&gt; we're we've turned a corner, folks. &gt;&gt; This is not about the great man anymore. It's about the great husband. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at Satan in the wilderness. He was trying to tempt him. And we're we're over halfway. So, we're going good. And so even when Satan was tempting Jesus in the wilderness and he was trying Jesus by the word of God and he was trying to get Jesus to reason against the word of God. And so Jesus was hungry. No doubt about it. He was probably extremely hungry. And you know, the devil's probably going, "Oh, Jesus, wouldn't these nice sourdough rolls with hot butter, [Music] &gt;&gt; right? Wouldn't they taste so good right now?" Amen. Tempting his flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So hungry, trying to get him to step out of the will of God because of his flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. But see what had to be fulfilled, the word. And so even though he was saying, "Oh, God, I am so hungry. I want that fresh hot butter bread. But but I can't and I won't." &gt;&gt; Satan, get you behind me. &gt;&gt; And he left for a season. &gt;&gt; It was no, you better back up, Satan. Here I go. Boom. Lightning bolt takes him out. No, he just says, "Satan, get you behind me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone, &gt;&gt; but by every word from the mouth of God. Amen. He stayed with the will of God, though his flesh screamed &gt;&gt; the opposite. &gt;&gt; Your emotions will scream the opposite sometimes. I've been there. A lot of us have been there. It'll scream the opposite, &gt;&gt; but you're going, "Lord, I'm not looking at my flesh. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at my emotions." The word says the word says. The word says, &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen. Hallelujah." As as you get closer to the manifestation of your prayer, that's when, brother Ram says, the devil starts a countdown or a showdown and he turns up the heat and it gets worse. Amen. Trying to discourage you. &gt;&gt; Amen. As Jesus was going to the cross, he said, "Lord," he goes, "Father, take this from me." &gt;&gt; Because the heat was turned up. Amen. But he came to that point, Lord, it it it'll only be a few hours of tearing my flesh and poking me with the spear, but not my will, but yours be done. &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way. In the ministry is, Lord, people only only bite and nash upon the ministry because they don't know any better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, please spare their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz maybe maybe you can use me in some way, right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's we're not Jews. Lord, wipe them all off the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; No. Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so the guy told him, "Look, look, brother. Look, nothing." trying to get brother Brandham to back up from that vision. Amen. But see, the same God who gave him that word gives us this word today. He, the devil saying, "Look, look, you're too sick. Forget it. You're going to die." Someone was telling me a testimony or about someone who believed what the doctor said. The doctor said, "Oh, you have cancer." And they went nine months confessing cancer. went finally to another doctor and and they did an exam and the person says, "Well, how long do I have to live?" And they go, "What do you what do you mean?" He goes, "Well, how far is the cancer?" He goes, "You don't have cancer." &gt;&gt; It was a misdiagnosis. &gt;&gt; I worked around doctors for almost 30 years. There's a reason why it's called the practice of medicine. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying &gt;&gt; somebody had to finish in the bottom of their class. &gt;&gt; And we're just paramedics. We don't know everything. But &gt;&gt; but when you're diagnosing a stroke and it's a blood sugar problem, &gt;&gt; I think I'd want a second opinion. Right? &gt;&gt; But see, we have the first opinion and that's what the word of God says to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the same God that gave brother Brandon the word has given you the word tonight. It is your atomic weapon is sitting right in your seat with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so that word is able to bring every one of your circumstances under dominion to you. &gt;&gt; What does brother Bram say when two omnipotence meet? Oo, I don't know, brother. &gt;&gt; No, I know. &gt;&gt; You're the bride and you're just like brother Marcus does. Got a big B right there. &gt;&gt; The letter, number, letter, whatever it is. Hallelujah. You're the wife of God last time I checked. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so we have to not believe our thoughts, not believe our flesh. Amen. You're not denying what's there, right? If if you have a cancer, you have a sickness or a condition, you say, "Lord, this is a line bluff that the devil has thrown on me." &gt;&gt; But I know that greater are you that is in me than he that's in this world. I'm going to stay with that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so Matthew 19:26, but Jesus, but Jesus beheld them and said unto them, "With men, this is impossible. With the flesh and the spirit realm, yeah, this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I like that one. Here's Job 42:2. I know that thou can't do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee. Praise the Lord Jesus. I know my husband can do anything. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord Jesus. I can even change the drive belt of my riding lawnmower. I That was the dirtiest I've ever been in my life cuz all that stuff falls down. And so I made a little video clip. I said, "This is the face of DIY." I said, "I am filthy." Amen. Hallelujah. Thank God for YouTube. Praise the Lord. Genesis 18:13 and 14. And the Lord said unto Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of assurity bear a child which I'm old? Is" And then he says, "What did you say? Is there anything too hard for the Lord? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, we're having hard times financially. Is there if you're paying your tithes &gt;&gt; on the gross, &gt;&gt; you know, I have I don't have any sympathy for people that don't pay their tithes or pay on the net. I'm sorry. I don't &gt;&gt; because we have a corporation and so I don't get all the money. So I feel very comfortable addressing it. Do you want a gross blessing or a net blessing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But that's your duty. That that's just your duty. &gt;&gt; Where you're blessed is when you give offerings. &gt;&gt; The lights have to come on. It's just not Oh, they just turn on miraculously. No, your general fund pays the bills. &gt;&gt; That comes from your offerings. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, is anything too hard for the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a thing. Praise the Lord Jesus. And so, Brother Brandham took one more big look. He said, "Oh, the beauty of the mountains." And and he's looking around and then all of a sudden he looks down and there's a little black spot. There it was. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I wonder if he looked at Bug Bud and says, "Take that." Hallelujah. So he he saw that grizzly where there was none before. I held that check in my hand where there was no money before. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I received health when the devil tried to take me with those blood clots &gt;&gt; where there wasn't health before. &gt;&gt; Amen. My family's been healed. &gt;&gt; You've been healed &gt;&gt; where there was no health before. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so God, Brother Bram says, God likes to work in the realms of the impossible. You say, "Well, brother, give me example." Old and New Testament, both. He loves giving babies to barren women or old women. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bam. Right there. &gt;&gt; He likes to use the impossible. And so this cosmos wants to keep our eyes on what it says about every part. What does what does fox say about us? &gt;&gt; Amen. What is and I I I don't get all the message people. Oh, he has a he has a new group, an office for of faith uh run by a woman who divorced her husband and slept with Benny Hinn. &gt;&gt; Boy, that's a good leader in every position almost as a woman. &gt;&gt; It's like I don't see why people get so excited about Trump even though he does do some things that we like, but we shouldn't be excited about any of that. We should be excited that Jesus Christ is come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In your flesh. Praise the Lord Jesus. And so it it it's it God looks and says, "No matter what the circumstances, I've got my eye on you. No matter if you're lonely, no matter if you're sick, I got my eye on you. And I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you." Amen. And so he he brings things once in a while to show you that he never will leave you nor forsake you. And so I want to ask you tonight, who gives you your daily benefits? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So why are you fooling around with the devil? &gt;&gt; Why are we fooling around with unbelief? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God that gives our a daily loads us with benefits. Amen. And and that's who we trust. That's who we love. That's what we want. And so Christ is bringing his word today cuz we've turned the corner through a womb of a true believer in him. He was not contaminated with your own thoughts of some one of the hundred different theories on the message. You have all things are possible to him that believed. tonight. You have his word. And so his word cannot be formed in a heart that it's hybrid with these other things. Well, brother, my pastor does this and he says it's all right. And I'm thinking, I don't care. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He doesn't want your condition to be man-made. Hallelujah. He wants to form himself in you through the purity of a clear womb. Amen. He wants us our thoughts in the morning to be of his word. Our thoughts at night to be of his word. Our speech when somebody when it when a deer rams your car. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That happened to me. I don't know within the last year. So I couldn't drive. Parked it on the side. Got my bag. I was on the way to preach. Started walking. Here's this guy in a suit with his messenger bag. The guy comes by and says, "Hey, do you need a ride?" Said, "Yeah." He goes, "Are you going to kill me?" I said, "Nope." And then we got there and a visitor was there. And that visitor afterwards came up and gave me a Pentecostal handshake with a lot of money to help pay for that damage, &gt;&gt; not even asking. &gt;&gt; Amen. We serve a miracle God. &gt;&gt; And so his pure word goes in a pure heart of faith. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I struggle. I make so many mistakes. I'm sorry. I don't want to hear him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God doesn't want to hear you. But God, how would you like your wife to But husband, I've been watching soap propos all day long and I haven't done anything. No, you don't want to hear that. You want to hear them them, you know, he wants to hear us say, "Lord, I've stumbled and I fell." He goes, "Yeah, I know." He goes, "But you got back up and repented." Because the bride of Christ will be seen as someone who's full of mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's not walking around invincible in that way. She is invincible by her husband on the inside. But we must get past the fact that we're going to make mistakes. Amen. But the desire has changed. So you get back up and you confess and you go forward. And so you and I, we punctuate every word of God with the amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything in this Bible, praise the Lord, we can say amen to that. And so all that she knows is what the word's telling her. And so people go, "Well, don't you think, you know, don't you think there's a better way than what you're being taught here at BCF?" &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. It It's all here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I I can't listen to you. Someone wanted me to receive a a false apostle in the message. And and I told the person, I said, "I can't I can't get past these three little words, husband of one wife." &gt;&gt; I can't get past that. &gt;&gt; In just that spirit infuriated that person. &gt;&gt; It's like, I'm sorry. I I got I got those words. I can't get past. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what the word says. So let's live by what he says. Amen. Look at the first church was molded by the word and the last church must be molded by the word of God alone. We are the same material. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so we are maturing into a faith with the same thoughts that Jesus Christ had with the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are Mrs. Jesus Christ. You are a little Messiah because you have the thoughts of God in you. And it's the same as Jesus had the thoughts of the father in him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just about done. Luke 1:36-38. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age. And this is the six months with her, who was called barren. For with God nothing is impossible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Mary, she goes, "Yeah, that's right. Behold the handmade of the Lord." That's me. Amen. Be it unto me according to the word. And the angel departed. Praise the Lord. That is you and I today. You're saying, "Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to the word. I'm nothing. I've ne I never will be, but I know what the word of God says." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so the word again has become flesh. &gt;&gt; Jesus walking in you tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That that scares people. But he's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's walking in flesh amongst the the message community. And that's why the message community doesn't like the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, you're such a pessimist. Okay. Right. That's scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's in flesh again. You tonight. That's you. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I don't feel like it. Oh, welcome to the club, right? &gt;&gt; How many of us ministers get up and it's like, man, I don't even feel saved today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Feel &gt;&gt; saved. &gt;&gt; But on the inside, one of them. &gt;&gt; One of them. Right. So you say, "Satan, don't take that as a nod to you." Amen. I'm just saying my body doesn't feel saved today, but I know that I am. Praise the Lord. And so that that flesh is becoming visible to those around you at school and at work, to your spouse. And so the word cannot produce itself in a womb that's polluted. That's why a denominational birth is a denominational birth, whether it's in message community or not. But the birth of Jesus Christ in you, that's the real birth. Amen. That's what changes you. Whatever you do in that altar, Amen. And and you confess that you have the Holy Ghost, then from that time on, you are changing. You don't go back home and you have about a week feeling good and then you're like, "No." Amen. You're just growing and you're stumbling &gt;&gt; and you're saying, "Oh Lord, I'm sorry, but I'm getting back up. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And so I if a person is born again and made alive through the faith of Jesus Christ in his word and you have that life on the inside, how can you be dead? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't. And let's go a step further. Brother Ram says, "How much more can a living person in Christ be able to have faith for a sickness?" &gt;&gt; But but what happens? We're like, we see the healing or the miracle up here, but God wants us to see it. Oh, it it's part of my package. In the name of Jesus Christ, the son of God, I receive it to myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't Don't It's you that has dominion because of him in you. It's the devil who's who's sewn into the bottom of your shoe. Amen. Praise the Lord. And so the life of a true believer, that's your credentials, not what church you go to, not how many quotes you can quote off the top of your head. The devil knows those. Amen. Hallelujah. But it's your life that's your credentials. Praise the Lord Jesus. It was the life that was brother Brandham's credentials. Praise the Lord. And so for the believer, there are there are times when we got to tell God, Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Help my unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help my unbelief. I know what I want. And you know, we want to understand what's God's saying, but we can ask for wisdom and leadership for what he's trying to say to us. Hallelujah. And when you've got the spirit of the Lord in you to believe for your own salvation, place that upon your family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Acts 2:39 is thus sayeth the Lord to you &gt;&gt; as a parent. And I can tell you absolutely it works. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You got quiet. &gt;&gt; And you're thinking, "Well, brother, you don't know my kids." No, I don't. Can they sin so far that God can't save him? &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; No. Acts 2:39. Say, "I claim them in the name of Jesus Christ. I claim it, God. I know how you're going to make her do it and how you're going to make him do it. &gt;&gt; But I believe it. I believe it, Lord. Help my unbelief. Claim it and watch what happens. It'll do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of, it'll do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And it'll happen in his time &gt;&gt; and his season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians can come. And so, how do you know it will happen? By faith. &gt;&gt; I don't judge it by my flesh, by my thoughts, by emotions. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I judge it by the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how we know that will happen because my husband said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, he wants us to be virgin to the word. He doesn't want anybody's ideas in our head. He He doesn't want us looking for the latest greatest message craze. I've lived long enough to where that that never works out &gt;&gt; because it's it's this herd mentality. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says that's the sign of the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People don't know who their pastor is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God will grow the word in a virgin womb &gt;&gt; to the manifestation of Jesus Christ today. My God today will save your children. My God today will heal your bodies. &gt;&gt; He will take away all sorts of perversion from your life. &gt;&gt; Too late. I've already seen it all. &gt;&gt; We We've already seen it done. Too late. &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil can't hold you. Brother Brandham said, Brother Chad, Brother Bram said that they were asking him about the maniac in Portland and he said they, you know, we know that part. They said, "Is he healed?" He goes, "No." He goes, "No, he he worships that demon and he believes he's right. &gt;&gt; He believes he's right. I I had to come to the point where I'm no longer right, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm helpless without you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when when God saved me, that's why I said I said, "Lord, let me come to your word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't let me follow what my message friends say I have to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Guess what he did? He He brought us to the to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's never left you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's always around you. He loves you so much. Uh if you read the Bible enough, Jesus wanted no one to perish. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; But people choose to. &gt;&gt; And in the Old Testament, God goes, "Choose life." Yeah. &gt;&gt; So tonight, let's choose the life of the word &gt;&gt; and walk in the light as he is in the light. Brother, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord, Lord, &gt;&gt; let's all stand. &gt;&gt; You surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. [Applause] You healed my body when I was sick. You surely been good to me. You healed my body when I was sick. You surely been good to me. You've healed my body when I was sick. You surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Oh, you saved my soul when I was lost. You surely been good to me. You saved my soul when I was lost. You surely been good to me. You saved my soul when I was lost. You surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. You filled me with the Holy Ghost. You surely been good to me. You filled me with the Holy Ghost. You surely been good to me. You filled me with the Holy Ghost. You surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. You have done what this world cannot do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is his word true? &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it always true? Amen. For will it always be true? Amen. I love the fact that brother Brandham told us that when Jesus was being tempted in the wilderness face to face like brother Rich was saying he didn't use any of his gifts, he didn't use any of his powers. He didn't use any of his abilities. He used one thing to defeat the devil and that's the word. &gt;&gt; Showing that the weakest Christian &gt;&gt; could take the word of God and defeat the devil. Brother said anywhere under any condition at any time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you feel like the weakest Christian, praise God, you've got something that will defeat the devil every time. You don't have to feel like the strongest Christian for this to work. You can feel like the weakest and it'll still work. &gt;&gt; How many appreciate the encouragement to believe. &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. Life is real. We live in a human flesh with a human spirit. We get knocked down, beat down. It's not that we don't believe, but we get bombarded. And we need somebody to bring us back to the reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what we see is reality is not reality. That's the vapor. That's the myth. But we got to come back to the reality which is the word of God. &gt;&gt; That'll never fade away. &gt;&gt; So I appreciate I appreciate a man who will bring us back to the realization that the word can't fail. &gt;&gt; Everything else will fade away, but the word cannot fail. That's right. I was reading through the book of Hebrews and it talked about all the what we call the heroes of the faith. And it says, "By faith they obtained a good report." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen, not by their deeds &gt;&gt; because they all had bad deeds. &gt;&gt; Do you want to go through the list in Hebrews? You want to start mentioning all their bad deeds? They all had bad deeds. What gave them a good report? &gt;&gt; They believed the word. &gt;&gt; They all had mistakes. They all had failures. And they got tossed about. And they they even got confused on the promise. Abraham even got confused on the promise. and listened to Sarah and tried to produce it in his own strength. And but the Bible says he grew strong in faith. Never doubted the word. There was something in him that couldn't doubt the word. His mind could get confused. His flesh could get confused. But there was something that would hold on for 25 years until the promise came to pass. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God. There's something in us that wants to keep holding on to this word. And I want to obtain a good report by faith. &gt;&gt; Because listen, I don't want to I don't want you to judge my natural report because it's got some bad grades. But they all obtained a good report by faith. Faith in what? Faith in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, help us to come back to what really matters more than anything. How I feel is not what really matters. What I see is not what really matters. What really matters is what you said and let's stay with that. Amen. I think we'll find as brother Rich was saying that our trials end up being the greatest times in our lives. &gt;&gt; Not during the trial but afterward when we see the word works &gt;&gt; and it becomes a mile mark or a post a a a pillar that we can look back to and say, you know what, I'm in trouble now, but I've already seen the word work here. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Rich was showing us in his own life. Amen. We may not we may not understand what's happening. We may be confused or beat down a little bit and under some strain and and maybe maybe feeling a lot of different things, but praise God, the word has worked in mile one and mile two and mile three. And we got all these markers that brought us this far and it's not going to fail now. Amen. &gt;&gt; And some of those things that we hated the most become the things that are our greatest testimonies now that we share with others to encourage them when they're down. &gt;&gt; The thing we didn't want to go through and the thing we didn't want to suffer with and the thing we wish would have went away in 5 minutes but lingered for years. Now when the word comes on the scene and brings about the promise, we look back and say, "Let me tell you a story &gt;&gt; about how the word works and how great God is and how he's promised the word and he'll keep it." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love preaching of encouraging faith. If there's anything we need more, we need to hold on by faith to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this evening. I was happy to be in church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going out encouraged to believe. &gt;&gt; And all of our situations are different, but we all got situations. But how many's encouraged to go forth and believe, &gt;&gt; to hold on to that word and keep reminding God that I still believe that? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the fulfillment, but I just want to remind you, God, I still believe it, &gt;&gt; but I'm waiting with expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together as we're dismissed. Lord Jesus. God, I thank you for the inspiration that you sent to encourage us. God, back to the simplest of simplest, the fundamental of a believer, and that's to believe. God, we're not always good workers. That's why you didn't call us workers because we fail at being workers. You call us believers because that's what you're looking for is someone who will believe. And God, you're so gracious that you didn't expect us to believe with our minds because we have fallen minds, with our willpower, because everything in us is corrupt. But before the foundation of the world, you placed a seed gene of faith on the inside. Something that we could believe with some part of yourself that was imparted to us that could respond to the word, that could believe it, that could hold on. When my mind can't hold on and my fingers can't, my will can't hold on. You've placed something deep within our soul that can hold on to the word, &gt;&gt; God. and help us to focus on that and move past the mind and move past the flesh and move beyond our ability till we strike that core of our soul and we find there a believer a believer that can say be it unto me according to your word God you're so gracious you're so kind to give us of yourselves God and you're so good to remind us of what matters most and you're so kind to remind us of what always works And God, may we walk out of here encouraged to believe to come back to the simplicity of just being a believer in the simple word. The devil wants everything to be complicated, but Lord, you've brought us back to the simplicity of being a believer. God, let us go forth as believers in your word. We love you. We ask that you would bless our brother Rich. That you would strengthen him. Encourage him, Lord. Pour back into him as you've used him to pour unto us. May you strengthen him and pour more of yourself into our brother. And may you give him, Lord, what he's dished out today. Give him faith and strength and encouragement. May he receive it, Lord, himself. That he could go back home, Lord, when it's time to go back home encouraged to keep believing there. And God, that you'll use him mightily wherever he goes. Bless us as we part. Lord, we walk in your grace. And God, we we walk by faith and that not of ourselves. It is a gift from you. God, thank you. We ask for your blessings over everyone as we go. Keep us safe along the way. And let our light shine in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. May God bless you all. It's so good to see you to worship together to say amen to the word together. Does my heart good. God bless you all this evening. Brother Riley Jesus Christ today all circumstances will be gone. The word of God will still remain. No sickness, fear, no guilt or strike can have control and worry me. The keys of faith are in my hands and I am bound for victory. I am free. My new day has come. Now I can be who I truly am.

[Applause] All things are possible with God. Sing that one more time. Oh, I am free. My new day has come. Now I can be who I truly am. I am free. Covered by his blood. All things are possible with God. All things are possible with God. [Music]
