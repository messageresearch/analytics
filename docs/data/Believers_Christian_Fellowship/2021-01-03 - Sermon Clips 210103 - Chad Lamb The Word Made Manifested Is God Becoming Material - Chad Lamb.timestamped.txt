[0:03] attributes thoughts gene germ word
[0:07] like i don't care what title you put to
[0:09] it but it's something from god
[0:11] it's a part of god it's a part of his
[0:13] essence of who he is and when he portion
[0:15] that part out he didn't say
[0:17] okay that's grade a
[0:21] that's c
[0:26] this one's not a very good part i'll put
[0:28] that in chad

[0:36] you don't have class b class c if it's a
[0:39] portion of god it's a portion of god
[0:41] amen how do you diminish the part of god
[0:43] how do you diminish a portion of god
[0:45] how does it become less or second class
[0:47] or or not good or somehow defective
[0:49] it's a portion of god it's a portion of
[0:52] god that he's placed in you
[0:53] and it's the thing that by the power of
[0:54] the holy ghost is directing your life
[0:56] it's a part that's reflecting back to
[0:58] him what he already programmed it for
[1:01] [Music]
[1:03] that's what's got to take the scare away
[1:05] amen how could we
[1:06] believe that we're children of god bride
[1:08] of jesus christ predestinated before the
[1:10] foundation of the world and how can we
[1:12] walk around with a second class
[1:14] christian mentality
[1:16] defeated and i'm no good and i don't
[1:18] measure up and i'll never be like the
[1:20] rest of them
[1:21] my goodness you've got a humanistic
[1:23] carnal mind and they have to get the
[1:25] mind of christ
[1:26] who thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:28] with god made himself of no reputation
[1:30] and became a man
[1:32] you say i i you know i am what god has
[1:35] made me by the grace of god but it's a
[1:36] portion of god
[1:37] it's not second class it's not defeated
[1:39] it's not defective
[1:40] it's not a junk pardon it's not left
[1:42] over
[1:44] it is a perfect amen unadulterated
[1:48] powerful part of god
[1:49] that he has programmed to do something
[1:51] in this life amen
[1:53] all i have to do is stay in the light of
[1:55] the hour stay in the fresh
[1:58] soft rain water that's falling from
[1:59] heaven and this seed will produce all
[2:01] that it was supposed to produce i don't
[2:03] have to pump it i don't have to prime it
[2:05] i don't have to manufacture
[2:06] i don't have to make something happen i
[2:08] don't have to feel under pressure to
[2:09] perform a certain act so that i feel
[2:12] like a first
[2:12] class part of god
[2:14] [Music]
[2:16] this takes all the pressure all the
[2:18] scare all the fear away
[2:20] you do not have to jump through somebody
[2:22] else's hoops to prove you're a son of
[2:23] god
[2:25] that's what the devil tried to do he
[2:27] tried to come up and say if thou be
[2:29] turn this bread and jesus never took the
[2:31] bait he says but the bible also says
