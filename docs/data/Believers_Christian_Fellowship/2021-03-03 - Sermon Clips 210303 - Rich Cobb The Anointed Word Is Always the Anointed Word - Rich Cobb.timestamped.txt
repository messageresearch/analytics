[0:00] just finally relax and let god
[0:03] lead don't be afraid to step out don't
[0:05] be afraid to pray and speak
[0:07] something into existence when you go to
[0:10] a hotel
[0:11] don't you pray and bind those spirits
[0:13] that you're speaking
[0:15] an atmosphere into existence and so with
[0:17] the
[0:18] and see you can't do this and be
[0:20] religious you can't do this and just be
[0:22] a message person amen
[0:23] you have to be in christ amen
[0:27] hallelujah ii samuel 22
[0:31] 29 and 31 for thou art my lamp oh lord
[0:35] praise god and the lord will lighten my
[0:39] darkness
[0:42] for by thee i have run through a troop
[0:45] by my god have i leaped over a wall
[0:48] as for god his way is perfect
[0:52] and the word of the lord is tried get
[0:55] that
[0:55] he is a buckler that all them that
[0:58] of all that trust in him amen and so the
[1:02] word
[1:03] amen not your thought not your favorite
[1:06] pastor not your favorite evangelist
[1:08] the actual word and you say well how do
[1:11] we know what is the actual word
[1:12] because it manifests it comes to pass
[1:15] amen
[1:16] and so when that is tried in your life
[1:19] then you know he is your shield and
[1:22] buckler you know
[1:23] absolutely that what you say will come
[1:26] to pass
[1:27] amen and don't doubt in your heart
[1:29] because you
[1:30] are part of him don't you set down in
[1:33] his throne
[1:36] you have authority over everything
[1:40] that's the earmark that's the trait of
[1:43] the bride amen
[1:44] that's why you're persecuted
[1:48] because you don't paul says i don't
[1:50] judge myself by others
[1:52] and that's why i don't i don't we don't
[1:54] judge ourselves by other message people
[1:56] right
[1:57] we don't judge ourselves by other other
[1:59] churches because last time i checked
[2:01] we're all sovereign
[2:03] but it's those that compare themselves
[2:06] with themselves
[2:07] that's a dangerous road to walk amen
[2:10] you you your grandmother your father
[2:12] your mother art is not your experience
[2:15] but you have to let go and compare your
[2:18] life
[2:18] with the word amen and i'll keep saying
[2:21] it over and
[2:22] over there's nothing greater than the
[2:23] word amen
[2:25] and i'm not just saying that i'm really
[2:26] meaning the word
