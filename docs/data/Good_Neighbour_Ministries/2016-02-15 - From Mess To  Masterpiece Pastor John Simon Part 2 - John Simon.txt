TRANSCRIPT
========================================
etly for his glory amen praise God hallelujah yes sir so here we are brothers and sisters we are here by God's grace and when we die physically then we are we have gone back to being just having our soul and that soul will either have to go for its reward or go for judgment you're going for reward or you're going for judgment God's right God Believers God's Sons and Daughters they will be judged but their judgment is not something they need to fear or worry about because there will be judged after to what level of rewards they're going to get it's nothing to do about going to hell amen I said hell is in your past I said hell is in your P you got nothing to do with hell no more amen don't even think about H matter of fact let me use B words forgetting the things which are behind let us press to the marck of the high which is in the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so hell not oh if I do this I might go to H oh no you don't have to worry about that anymore because now you recognize you are an eternal being and if Eternal being you have no beginning you will have no ending from God you're going back to God Amen the prophet of God said God can't destroy you or get rid of you more than if you get rid of his own self because you are a part of him with glory to God you a part of him that's revealed that's the reason why you can't move from the world because you are part of the you will be condemning and and uh you will be U not just condemning yourself but you will be going against your own self you will be true to yourself amen you will not be true to yourself because you are a part of that word revealed Hallelujah you are not capital Z but know you not you a common go amen you're a little God is that right pares bring forthes is that right goats bring forth goats and God bring forth what amen messiah messiah yes praise the Lord praise the Lord so we are a part of him revealed so now when you hear the prophet came and he began to speak the the unveiling of the Mighty God the people are just thinking only that it's the unveiling of Jesus who was back there but he's he's now unveiling this bride he's unveiling that she is him now revealed the son of man back there the headship the male and now the son of man Adam their names Adam now the son of man being revealed again but now in the bright form in the form of a muled body GL to God hallelujah you talk about a masterpiece amen praise be to God that great wonderful work of art was nothing but a mystery that was covered up until we got the unveiling of the Mighty God the rec that I am identifyed with Christ and I am a part of him now being revealed glory to God hallelujah thanks be to God what a wonderful invitation in Ephesians 2 verse S amen that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness towards us amen through Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my in the ages to come that he will show us off as examples of trophies of His Marvelous Grace amen praise God now you say brother Simon what is Grace Grace is God's unmerited favor yes in other words there is nothing that you did to marry nothing it's just as if you were at home and Bill Gates or Warren Buffett uh you know maybe they're reading the newspaper or or or something and something struck them about your name or about you you say you know what I I want to do something for that guy or that woman and the next thing you know somebody knocks on your door and there you are so here's a I've been sent by Mr Warren Buffett and here's the check he said sent you a check for $10 million which is like pocket change for him1 million praise the Lord that should be the reaction that you receive it but that is not for you to say oh it's too it's too good to be true I can't take it it's too much I don't believe it this is like a brother that we knew became a preacher in the United States but back then in the Old Country he was very very poor preaching one God and baptism in Jesus name and there was no milk in the house and he has these wife have these babies they're squalling they're hungry no money and that night we prayed and asked God father if you could just send us some milk you know even if even if we don't get bread already else just send us some milk just I need just one can of milk or whatever the next morning around about 5:30 Bang Bang Bang on his door he opens the door there's an old sister she says brother I was you know I was W woken up this morning early by the Holy Spirit and told me to get uh this milk here to you by this time and that's the reason why I'm here amen and he says oh praise God hallelujah he says and when he looks he sees she have he said take it back sister take it back I only asked for one because she had a whole box it's too much it's too good to be true it's too wonderful to believe and that's the grace of God that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeing in him should not perish but should have everlasting life glory to God and there are people in this world that thinks it's too good to be true it couldn't happen it's just a story and they don't want to believe it amen think about God giving himself to for us to extend his grace to us and make us his child and now he's trying to call us he's trying to bring us into his wonderful love and Grace at this particular time amen listen I'm jumping over stuff here because time is going away and now the next one is say this after me I am Priceless I am say it again I am Priceless hallelujah praise the Lord look verses 8 and N uh if they're up there now for by grace are you save through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not works lest any man should boast salvation is what a free gift not from water bucket but from God I said it's a free gift from God glory to his wonderful name and you could not possibly purchase it you couldn't buy it because why it is priceless the Bible says Peter said we were not redeemed with silver and with gold but with the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ oh love to sing the Precious Blood of God's own son has saved and Sanctified how wonderous B and we are all the bright the hair rejected one mess and despise someday the Lord will bring his chosen ones within those Gates and that's worth everything when we inside those Gates of world we learn a lot of things we
