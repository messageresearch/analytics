[40:00] of the world and it never has an ending
[40:02] to them that believe in the great
[40:05] Victory you know um I just want to go
[40:09] back to
[40:12] 1993 in
[40:15] 1993 let's go to the next slide one of
[40:18] the greatest
[40:20] stories in baseball history took place
[40:23] right here in
[40:25] Toronto it was the story of Joe Carter
[40:28] JC in 1993 World Series home run and it
[40:33] was the baseball play that occurred in
[40:36] game seven of the 1993 World Series on
[40:41] October
[40:42] 23rd
[40:44] 1993 it was at the
[40:47] Skydome in
[40:49] Toronto in the bottom of the 9th Inning
[40:51] Joe Carter hit a one out three-run
[40:55] walkoff home run run off Philly uh
[40:59] Philly's closer Mitch Williams to give
[41:02] the Toronto Blue Jays its second
[41:06] consecutive World Series
[41:09] championship this was only the second
[41:11] time in Major League Baseball history
[41:14] that the World Series ended on a walkoff
[41:18] home run the first time was in game 7 of
[41:22] 1960 World Series when Pittsburgh
[41:25] Pirates second baseman Bill m kski hit a
[41:28] home run off New York Yankees pitcher
[41:31] Ralph Terry to win the game by a final
[41:33] score of 10 to9 Carter's home run in
[41:39] 1993 however was the only time in Major
[41:42] League Baseball history that a team hit
[41:45] a walk-off home run while trailing six
[41:49] to5 in the bottom of the
[41:52] ninth you want to talk about Against All
[41:55] Odds and they ended up winning the World
[41:58] Series
[42:00] 8-6 you know back at that back in 1992
[42:05] 93
[42:07] 94 what was happening was what was
[42:10] called the Toronto blessing people
[42:12] people recognized it as the Toronto
[42:15] blessing and you know I was thinking
[42:16] about all that and you know just
[42:18] pondering on this this whole thought and
[42:22] it took me back to those years and in
[42:25] 1992 93 the the trono uh you know Blue
[42:29] Jays won the World Series back to back I
[42:32] believe that God was pouring out his
[42:35] Spirit you think well what's that got to
[42:37] do with baseball it's got nothing to do
[42:40] with baseball it's got to do with the
[42:42] power and the spirit of God coming into
[42:46] the midst of a blessing that was being
[42:50] spread and starting to revive and move
[42:53] through the hearts of people right here
[42:56] in the Toronto area area a lot of us can
[42:59] go back and recognize that it was at
[43:01] that time that that many of us came in I
[43:05] know that it was in
[43:07] 1994 when myself and sister Jennifer
[43:11] received the power of the Holy Ghost
[43:13] because God was moving God was blessing
[43:16] God was pouring out his Spirit not just
[43:18] in Toronto but it was recognized in
[43:22] Toronto listen the Toronto blessing
[43:24] broke and I and I'm going to add was
[43:27] publicly recognized then but it had
[43:30] already been happening in '92 and 93
[43:34] there was talk about the spirit moving
[43:36] and and Protestant churches you know um
[43:40] just leftwing rightwing just starting to
[43:42] experiencing outpourings of the Holy
[43:45] Spirit crying and weeping there was a
[43:47] great Revival that took place at the
[43:49] Toronto Airport and that's where you
[43:52] know it it really became public and
[43:54] people started to recognize that what's
[43:56] going on here there's there's an
[43:58] outpouring of God's spirit and I believe
[44:02] that the Toronto Blue Jays they reive
[44:05] the benefit of that
[44:07] outpouring because here's a Canadian
[44:09] team in a in a baseball league where
[44:11] it's 98% us baseball players and teams
[44:16] and here's a Canadian team that doesn't
[44:18] do it just one year they do it two years
[44:21] back to back I believe God was pouring
[44:23] out his prosperity and his anointing
[44:27] upon the city of Toronto amen and
[44:29] anybody that was in that atmosphere and
[44:32] and was was was uh you know had some
[44:35] representation within their hearts God
[44:38] was starting to speak to them and I was
[44:41] one of those that God was speaking to
[44:43] and I know there's others here that God
[44:45] was dealing with their lives moving in
[44:48] their hearts and bringing them to a
[44:50] recognition of his spirit and his
[44:53] anointing amen praise God it was back
[44:57] then in
[44:59] 1993 that I was living in Miss Saga and
[45:03] I came home one day and I seen a a man
[45:08] and two children and one of them was my
[45:10] son Michael playing on the front lawn
[45:14] and so I pulled in and I came into the
[45:16] driveway and I walked over and I looked
[45:19] and it was Pat Borders the back catcher
[45:21] for the Toronto Blue Jays playing
[45:23] baseball with my son Michael and his son
[45:26] cuz they were the same Mage and I said
[45:28] hey how you doing he says oh great you
[45:31] know nice to meet you says we just moved
[45:33] in next door and here I you know when
[45:36] when I started to think about all this
[45:38] you think well what are you telling us
[45:40] here brother Danny I'm telling you this
[45:42] because it was at that time that a lot
[45:45] of change was coming into into our lives
[45:47] into our home into our family amen into
[45:51] the in into the ministry you can go back
[45:53] and look at what took place in in Eagles
[45:56] cry Ministry at at the time that's what
[45:58] it was called there was a supernatural
[46:01] Revival that was taking place in the
[46:03] lives of many people at that time and
[46:06] our church literally exploded in 1993 94
[46:12] 95 and many hearts and lives were turned
[46:16] to Jesus Christ I realized by meeting
[46:19] Pat Borders that I was right on the
[46:22] border of a great change coming in my
[46:26] life because it was in
[46:28] January of
[46:30] 1994 that the that the message of the
[46:33] hour was was shared by Brother Gabriel
[46:37] Fetti and I realized that that you know
[46:39] something Supernatural was taking place
[46:42] in my life now that I look back I can
[46:45] only see the
[46:47] supernatural because our lives are not
[46:50] ours they're ordered and ordained of God
[46:55] you might think that you're here here
[46:57] today because you just thought you would
[46:58] just go to church but I know many of you
[47:01] are here today because you have a
[47:03] relationship based on an experience that
[47:07] God gave you
[47:09] personally if it's not a personal
[47:11] relationship then what is it it's
[47:15] just tradition it's just like 98% of the
[47:19] world out there that's in the churches
[47:21] this morning they're there because they
[47:22] feel they have to be there they want to
[47:24] be seen that's not why we're here here
[47:28] we're here because of an experience a
[47:30] reality amen some things are better
[47:33] experienced than explained I believe
[47:36] Joel Carter to this day can still feel
[47:40] the anointing and the atmosphere that
[47:42] that that was around him when he hit
[47:44] that ball out of the park and the and
[47:46] the people went crazy it's an experience
[47:50] that you know I can't explain to you
[47:52] that
[47:53] experience you'd have to experience it
[47:55] yourself you would have had to be there
[47:58] I was not there but I know that his name
[48:00] is now you know it's been it's been
[48:03] named many times over the pulpit even
[48:05] our pastor talks about the great you
[48:08] know uh uh home run that was hit by JC I
[48:12] believe JC hit a great home run when he
[48:14] when he called you when he when he came
[48:17] after you when he when he uh uh did
[48:19] everything he it was beyond odds that he
[48:22] could actually reach
[48:23] you I look back and I said Lord it's a
[48:26] miracle amen that you got a hold of
[48:29] me it's a miracle I'm looking at
[48:33] Miracles all around me here Miracles you
[48:37] want to you know people want to see
[48:38] Miracles they want to see people raised
[48:40] from the dead listen you want to see
[48:41] somebody raised from the dead just see
[48:44] somebody that their life was was lost in
[48:48] sin and now they're living and walking
[48:50] for Christ that is a true
[48:54] Resurrection there's no greater miracle
[48:57] that we could ever witness than to
[48:58] witness an individual that has come into
[49:01] a personal relationship with Jesus
[49:04] Christ and their lives being transformed
[49:07] and now they they they they sing they
[49:10] worship they're not ashamed to to name
[49:14] the name of Jesus Christ the Savior
[49:17] Hallelujah I don't know anybody that
[49:20] lives in this city in this province in
[49:24] this country that doesn't hold a driver
[49:27] license if they hold one and it says
[49:29] that that driver's license has a date on
[49:32] it that they were born and the date that
[49:35] they were born was in direct correlation
[49:38] to the death burial and resurrection of
[49:42] Jesus
[49:43] Christ every single driver's
[49:47] license whether they're Muslim whether
[49:50] they're Christian whether they're
[49:52] Buddhist I don't know whatever they
[49:54] might be but there's only one one
[49:57] individual that rose from the
[49:59] dead and that was Jesus Christ there's
[50:02] no other evidence anywhere showing that
[50:05] anybody else actually resurrected from
[50:09] the dead but Jesus
[50:12] Christ amen Easter is the time of year
[50:16] when we remember the biggest most
[50:18] pivotal moment that changed the world
[50:23] forever praise God let's go to the next
[50:26] slide
[50:28] some things are better
[50:30] experienced amen than
[50:33] explained Luke 1 uh Luke 24: 1
[50:37] to8 now upon the first day of the week
[50:40] very early in the morning they came unto
[50:43] the supper bringing the spices which
[50:46] they had prepared and certain others
[50:49] with them and they found the stone
[50:51] rolled away from the seler and they
[50:54] entered in and found nothing not the
[50:57] body of the Lord Jesus a lot of people
[51:00] go into churches today a lot of people
[51:02] you know there's a lot of churches today
[51:04] that are preaching their own doctrines
[51:06] their own thoughts their own ideas of
[51:08] what Jesus Christ and who Jesus Christ
[51:10] is they'll put them into a trinity
[51:12] they'll put him into a uh uh you know
[51:15] all kinds of oh he was just a great
[51:16] Master he was just a great man that that
[51:18] reached great levels of consciousness
[51:21] I'll tell you those churches that are
[51:22] preaching those kinds of things are like
[51:25] tombs there's nothing in there you're
[51:28] not going to find Jesus in that tomb
[51:31] you'll only find Jesus if you know that
[51:34] he's resurrected and he's alive now amen
[51:38] amen and it came to pass as there were
[51:41] perplexed thereabout behold two men
[51:44] stood by them in shining garments and as
[51:47] they were afraid and bowed down their
[51:51] faces to the Earth they said unto them
[51:54] why seek ye living among the the dead he
[51:57] is not here but is risen remember how he
[52:01] spake unto you when he was yet in
[52:03] Galilee saying the son of man must be
[52:05] delivered into the hands of sinful men
[52:08] and be crucified and the third day rise
[52:11] again and they remembered his words amen
[52:16] praise God now the Tomb of Jesus had
[52:19] been sealed by a massive
[52:22] Stone it was a stone that was placed
[52:25] there by the Romans and there was
[52:27] absolutely no way that that uh you know
[52:31] a few people could go there and just
[52:33] move that stone it could have weighed a
[52:35] ton or two that's how big it they would
[52:38] use an army of of soldiers and
[52:41] especially the tomb where they laid
[52:43] Jesus because there was Talk Amongst the
[52:45] people that hey wait a minute here we
[52:48] need to be careful because you know
[52:50] there's talk about this this individual
[52:52] Rising again I mean we've had enough
[52:55] trouble we've had enough trouble with
[52:57] him as it is and so we want to make sure
[53:00] that that somebody doesn't go in there
[53:01] and steal the body and make it look like
[53:04] he was
[53:06] resurrected well guess what in Matthew's
[53:09] account we read that it tells us how the
[53:12] stone was rolled away it shows that it
[53:14] was a mighty angel that God sent down
[53:18] because God had a plan God had a purpose
[53:21] there was no way they were going to
[53:23] change God's purpose and Plan of
[53:25] Redemption
[53:27] God had to God had to prepare everything
[53:30] just exactly right and he knew that they
[53:33] would not believe and so the only way
[53:36] that he could overcome their unbelief
[53:38] was to supernaturally do it himself he
[53:42] sent an angel down there because he said
[53:45] he was going to rise he didn't say that
[53:47] somebody's going to come and roll away
[53:49] the the the stone and and steal my body
[53:53] he said I will rise again I'm gonna do
[53:57] this work and nothing no Gates none the
[54:01] not the gates of hell no individual no
[54:04] Pharisees Sadducees no Romans no no
[54:07] teachings of man is going to change what
[54:09] I'm going to do amen he had the listen
[54:13] the stone of unbelief has been rolled
[54:16] away hallelujah it's been rolled away
[54:19] amen and you don't need to be going and
[54:21] running inside the tomb to see if Jesus
[54:23] is in
[54:25] there look what happened the women
[54:28] quickly they they they they quickly
[54:31] rushed off to go and tell let's read the
[54:34] next
[54:35] scripture let's go to the next
[54:39] slide and returned from the supper
[54:42] verses 9 to2 and told all these things
[54:46] unto the 11 and to all the rest it was
[54:49] Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the
[54:51] mother of James and other women that
[54:53] were with them which told these things
[54:56] unto the apostles and their words seemed
[54:59] to them as Idle Tales can you imagine
[55:03] here the apostles had Walk With Jesus
[55:05] they talk with Jesus they had witnessed
[55:08] all the Miracles and all the things that
[55:10] he was doing and yet they couldn't
[55:13] believe what what's going on what is
[55:16] that well I'll tell you we're going to
[55:18] get to that because it's the same thing
[55:20] that's happening today A lot of people
[55:23] are being told that Jesus Christ is
[55:25] Resurrected
[55:27] but to a lot of people that oh yes
[55:29] that's nice yes oh did you oh did did
[55:31] you have an Easter hunt at
[55:34] church did you put up the Easter
[55:37] Bunnies that's not what the resurrection
[55:40] is all about it's not about bunnies and
[55:45] eggs but you see the people unless
[55:48] something
[55:49] Supernatural something real takes place
[55:53] it's only just a traditional event
[55:57] and it and they find it hard to believe
[55:59] people you you'll tell people about
[56:01] miracles you'll tell them about things
[56:03] that have happened we've had Miracles
[56:05] take place right here in this church
[56:06] people completely delivered from cancer
[56:10] people made whole from all kinds of
[56:12] different diseases and and sicknesses
[56:15] and and and and mental sickness and and
[56:19] all kinds of situations where God
[56:22] supernaturally delivers you tell the
[56:25] people about it we had one individual
[56:26] that gave a testimony right from this
[56:28] Pulpit that had actually died and Rose
[56:32] back from a a coma she the doctors had
[56:36] said she's she's not going to make it
[56:39] but her mother said no God never showed
[56:41] me that no sir she's going to rise again
[56:45] and the doctor said well that's fine
[56:47] ma'am you can listen to the testimony
[56:49] it's on
[56:50] YouTube amen you want to hear about it
[56:53] just see one of the deacons they'll tell
[56:54] you they'll tell you about the link and
[56:56] you can listen in it was somebody that
[56:58] was right here in this church for many
[57:00] many years amen praise God and and after
[57:04] about seven days while the doctor was
[57:06] there and the mother was there and they
[57:08] were talking and the doctor was checking
[57:10] on her and she was still in a deep coma
[57:12] saying that she was not going to come
[57:14] out of it she opened her
[57:17] eyes and she told the story that it
[57:21] wasn't the appointed time for her yet
[57:24] that's what she was told and I believe
[57:26] every single one of us has an appointed
[57:28] time and season but they thought it was
[57:31] just idle tales and and they believe
[57:33] them not then arose Peter and ran into
[57:36] the SRE and stooping down he beheld the
[57:39] linen cloths laid by themselves and
[57:41] departed wondering in himself at that
[57:44] which had come to pass he knew that the
[57:47] Lord Jesus said that he would rise again
[57:49] but even then it would take more it
[57:52] would take more for them to recognize
[57:55] that that Jesus Christ was actually
[57:58] really alive amen how would you possibly
[58:02] go to you know think about it here you
[58:05] are you're the witness those sisters
[58:07] they went to the tomb there they talked
[58:09] to those Mighty angels that were
[58:10] standing there they they you know
[58:13] uh how do you go back and you tell the
[58:16] people and expect them to believe you
[58:18] would think that they would believe
[58:20] because to you it happened you know the
[58:22] experience that you had and when you
[58:24] tell somebody about your testimony you
[58:26] know your own experience and you and
[58:28] it's a reality to you but but but to
[58:31] others unless they experience it for
[58:34] themselves you see some things are
[58:36] better experienced than explained that's
[58:40] why when Nathaniel was told you know
[58:43] come
[58:43] see come see a man come see when the
[58:47] woman at the well when when when the
[58:49] Holy Spirit when Jesus Christ had
[58:51] discerned her life and told her all
[58:53] about herself she ran into the city and
[58:56] she literally was screaming and saying
[58:59] come see a man that has told me all
[59:03] about my life and has delivered me and
[59:06] you know that from her testimony many
[59:09] had come many came to Christ the whole
[59:11] town many of them were converted to the
[59:13] word of God and your testimony is what
[59:16] this world needs your testimony is what
[59:20] your workplace needs they need to know
[59:22] that you're a living testimony that you
[59:25] have experienced
[59:27] not by
[59:28] knowledge but an experience of Jesus
[59:31] Christ amen glory to God you know like
[59:35] how can you possibly uh you know tell
[59:38] that kind of a story it's something that
[59:40] you need to
[59:42] experience you
[59:44] know I go
[59:46] back when I was young I was about seven
[59:49] or eight years
[59:50] old and I had an experience that I
[59:53] couldn't quite understand and and I
[59:55] finally did understand that after 30
[59:58] years coming to the
[1:00:00] Lord but I was about seven or eight
[1:00:02] years old and I was in a classroom and I
[1:00:04] remember it's so clear it'll never leave
[1:00:06] me and you can you know you can go back
[1:00:08] and think about experiences that you may
[1:00:10] have
[1:00:11] had and I was sitting there at a desk in
[1:00:14] a in a classroom I was looking out the
[1:00:16] window and all of a sudden a thought
[1:00:19] came into my mind and said why am I
[1:00:24] here what is this all about the thought
[1:00:28] just came into my mind like that and
[1:00:30] then all of a sudden a euphoric
[1:00:33] atmosphere came around me that I could I
[1:00:37] to this day the only way that I know
[1:00:40] what it was is because now I realized it
[1:00:42] was the Lord it was God intervening at a
[1:00:46] young age you know you can go back and
[1:00:48] you can think about experiences that you
[1:00:50] may have had where where you know at
[1:00:53] that moment I felt such Liberty and such
[1:00:57] Joy everything was just all right I
[1:01:01] that's all I can remember and and I and
[1:01:03] I just felt it and then and then it was
[1:01:05] gone now nobody can ever take that away
[1:01:09] from me because I experienced it I can
[1:01:12] explain it to you all day long unless
[1:01:15] you have experienced that there's no way
[1:01:18] for you to really
[1:01:20] know and this is what Easter is Easter
[1:01:25] is not an event it's an
[1:01:28] experience of the event in our day amen
[1:01:33] and so that experience was something
[1:01:36] that I could not possibly understand and
[1:01:39] it was not until 30 years
[1:01:42] later or you know about 20 some odd
[1:01:46] years later when I came to the Lord in
[1:01:48] 1994 and it was maybe you know after
[1:01:51] about the first 6 months that I was
[1:01:54] serving God I was coming to the church
[1:01:57] and they would have prayer meetings and
[1:01:59] I remember driving to the prayer meeting
[1:02:02] with a friend from the church and I was
[1:02:04] telling him you know it was wonderful
[1:02:06] that God has delivered me from the drug
[1:02:08] addiction by then God had already
[1:02:10] delivered me and it was a supernatural
[1:02:12] event but there was no emotional um uh
[1:02:17] physical other than the fact that that
[1:02:19] he had just removed the desire for the
[1:02:21] drugs it was gone I can't explain that
[1:02:25] you know it's like somebody that was
[1:02:27] blind and all of a sudden they can see
[1:02:29] well they can see there wasn't any kind
[1:02:32] of you know emotional Supernatural you
[1:02:35] know lights come down from heaven and
[1:02:37] all these things and and and and you
[1:02:39] know uh it was just it just took place
[1:02:43] and I was telling him you know it's it's
[1:02:45] wonderful that I'm experiencing this
[1:02:47] Liberty I'm I'm free from this addiction
[1:02:50] but I said but I want to know him and
[1:02:54] feel him and see him and touch him I
[1:02:59] remember saying that I said I I want
[1:03:02] more I know I've I I've been delivered
[1:03:05] it was just like you know you go back
[1:03:07] and and you know what we just read here
[1:03:08] and there was people that had
[1:03:10] experienced Christ they had seen you
[1:03:12] know the reality of of people that were
[1:03:15] lame and they would get you know their
[1:03:18] legs would become whole again there was
[1:03:20] a dead girl and she rose up again they
[1:03:22] had witnessed those things they had seen
[1:03:24] those things but they had not
[1:03:27] experienced it even when he said he
[1:03:29] would resurrect they would still not
[1:03:33] believe what is it something more needs
[1:03:36] to happen something more in the
[1:03:39] experience needs to take place and it
[1:03:42] wasn't until that night I couldn't there
[1:03:44] was nothing that could prepare me for
[1:03:46] what I was entering into that night on
[1:03:48] that prayer meeting all I knew is that I
[1:03:51] had a desire for him and I wanted to to
[1:03:54] know him in a greater way and in the
[1:03:57] midst of that prayer meeting we were all
[1:03:59] just praying we were in the sanctuary
[1:04:01] and then all of a sudden something took
[1:04:03] place the atmosphere changed uh people
[1:04:06] started standing up screaming crying and
[1:04:09] I thought oh I feel something changing
[1:04:11] in the atmosphere but still it was it
[1:04:13] was it was nothing more than what I was
[1:04:15] hearing with my ears and and I was just
[1:04:18] kind of sensing but then all of a sudden
[1:04:21] a presence and an anointing came over me
[1:04:25] and engulfed me and all I can tell you
[1:04:28] is that all I was saying was please
[1:04:31] don't leave me ple that's all that was
[1:04:33] coming out of my mouth don't leave don't
[1:04:36] leave the atmosphere and the love that I
[1:04:39] experienced in that atmosphere in that
[1:04:41] presence nobody can ever take it away
[1:04:45] from me God is a reality I experienced
[1:04:50] God's love you know they called the
[1:04:52] Toronto blessing that that it was like
[1:04:55] an outpour ing of God's love because
[1:04:57] people were experiencing it so much they
[1:04:59] were crying they were praising God they
[1:05:01] were worshiping in ways that that you
[1:05:03] know it got it got uh you know where
[1:05:06] where people actually started to get
[1:05:07] ridiculous because without the spirit
[1:05:10] without an at an attribute of God inside
[1:05:12] of you that baptism of the spirit of God
[1:05:15] when it comes on you you know people
[1:05:17] were acting like dogs acting like cats
[1:05:20] that like that's not God though the
[1:05:23] spirit falls on the just
[1:05:26] and the unjust you see when the spirit
[1:05:29] comes down it's going to actually show
[1:05:32] what kind of seed is actually there and
[1:05:35] if you're a son or a daughter of God and
[1:05:38] the spirit of God comes down upon you
[1:05:40] you melt in his presence you feel his
[1:05:44] love you yeah you can shout you can
[1:05:46] Rejoice all those things but you're gon
[1:05:49] to you're going to show the character of
[1:05:50] Jesus
[1:05:52] Christ hallelujah praise God amen it's
[1:05:56] not something that I could
[1:05:59] possibly explain to you it's all I could
[1:06:02] do it to to put it into words but I
[1:06:04] experienced his love and I know that
[1:06:07] love and that love is what keeps me and
[1:06:10] I know it's what's keeping every son and
[1:06:13] daughter of God it was his love that
[1:06:15] went to the cross and took all your sin
[1:06:19] that took everything necessary in order
[1:06:22] to bring you back to him because this is
[1:06:25] all about a Redemptive plan it's all
[1:06:28] about him bringing you back to who you
[1:06:31] really are you're not that flesh and
[1:06:34] blood that you think that you are inside
[1:06:38] of there brother Braham talks about how
[1:06:40] the how God sent the Holy Spirit and the
[1:06:43] Sun and the anointing it would come upon
[1:06:46] you know seed that would that that would
[1:06:48] be covered with stone you know some fell
[1:06:50] on good ground some fell on on Stony
[1:06:52] ground you know but the sun came not to
[1:06:55] burn the stone it came to give life to
[1:06:58] the seed that was that that was covering
[1:07:02] that seed amen a lot of us have got a
[1:07:04] lot of covering on us we're dealing with
[1:07:07] this flesh and we're having to overcome
[1:07:10] the things of this life but the spirit
[1:07:12] of God is coming on that seed that's in
[1:07:15] you to bring out who you really are amen
[1:07:19] glory to God Easter changes everything
[1:07:24] when you encounter the love of God it's
[1:07:27] not enough just to hear and read the
[1:07:30] Easter story or to intellectually
[1:07:32] understand the Easter story but to
[1:07:35] experience it fully and and and
[1:07:38] experience that incredible love of when
[1:07:41] he comes to you
[1:07:44] personal I've read it said that
[1:07:46] Christmas was the promise you know that
[1:07:49] you know everybody say oh the the
[1:07:51] Messiah was going to come unto us a son
[1:07:54] is given but that Easter was the proof
[1:07:57] when that son grew and went to Calvary
[1:08:00] and Rose and was resurrected again that
[1:08:03] was the actual proof that he was the
[1:08:07] Messiah he was God he is God and he's
[1:08:10] resurrected here today and now for you
[1:08:15] amen praise God the Apostle Paul writes
[1:08:17] a prayer to the early Church in Ephesus
[1:08:20] with this in mind God's love for us is
[1:08:23] so unimaginable that that Paul prays for
[1:08:26] them to experience it in its fullness
[1:08:29] let's go to the next
[1:08:31] slide Ephesians chapter 3:
[1:08:34] 16-19 that he would Grant you now pay
[1:08:37] attention read the word wake up and read
[1:08:41] the word that he would Grant you
[1:08:44] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:08:47] be strengthened with might by his Spirit
[1:08:50] we're talking about the Easter
[1:08:51] experience that only comes by his Spirit
[1:08:53] you heard the quote that brother brand
[1:08:55] uh brother Tim read this morning from
[1:08:57] brother brandom that it that it that it
[1:08:59] was the the supernatural anointing that
[1:09:02] was coming down to bring forth who you
[1:09:05] really are Sons and Daughters of God by
[1:09:09] his spirit in the inner man that Christ
[1:09:11] May dwell in your hearts by Revelation
[1:09:14] that's what faith is that ye being
[1:09:17] rooted and grounded in
[1:09:20] love may be able to comprehend now look
[1:09:24] at this is how he explains it to
[1:09:26] comprehend with all the saints what is
[1:09:29] the breadth the length the depth the
[1:09:33] height and to know the love of Christ
[1:09:37] which passeth knowledge listen that's
[1:09:39] why I said I can't explain it to you if
[1:09:42] you've experienced God's love if you've
[1:09:45] come to a place where where where where
[1:09:46] your experience was to the point where
[1:09:48] you died completely you you you gave up
[1:09:53] everything for this word you surrendered
[1:09:56] everything you said Lord I I remember I
[1:09:58] remember that drug addiction had such a
[1:10:00] hold of me and and and I remember I
[1:10:03] didn't want it anymore I desired it for
[1:10:05] to for it to be gone but it was too
[1:10:07] powerful it had a hold of me but there
[1:10:11] had to be something stronger and when
[1:10:13] you get to that place of desperation in
[1:10:15] your life and in your walk where you
[1:10:18] want change and where you don't want
[1:10:20] that old life anymore you don't want to
[1:10:22] be controlled by your emotions and by
[1:10:24] your memories and by the scars of the
[1:10:27] past there's only one way that you can
[1:10:30] achieve that you're going to need to
[1:10:31] experience the love of God that comes
[1:10:34] when he calls you he says and to know
[1:10:37] the love of Christ which passeth
[1:10:39] knowledge that ye might be filled with
[1:10:42] all the fullness of
[1:10:45] God now unto him that is able to do
[1:10:49] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:10:52] ask or think according to the power that
[1:10:55] worketh in US listen he's able to do
[1:10:58] there's nothing there is absolutely
[1:11:01] nothing that he can't take care of it he
[1:11:05] can't make it better he listen you you
[1:11:09] need you need a healing this morning
[1:11:10] he's the Healer he can do it you just
[1:11:14] got to accept it you got to you got to
[1:11:16] know that it was already finished when
[1:11:17] he went to that day it was paid in full
[1:11:20] that Good Friday at Calvary it was paid
[1:11:22] in
[1:11:23] full it's a finish work amen exceedingly
[1:11:28] above what we ask more than what you
[1:11:30] could possibly imagine he can do
[1:11:32] it unto him be glory in the church by
[1:11:37] what Jesus Christ throughout all ages
[1:11:40] World Without End it's according to the
[1:11:44] power that's within us amen praise God
[1:11:49] there's no greater love than his love
[1:11:53] and that's my prayer today
[1:11:55] that you will experience that kind of
[1:11:57] love I pray that as we remember the
[1:12:01] Rugged Cross and the nail scarred hands
[1:12:03] and we remember what he did for us that
[1:12:05] as we recall that the that the rolled
[1:12:08] away Stone and the empty tomb that offer
[1:12:11] that offer us power over sin and death
[1:12:14] that we would be able to sense how
[1:12:15] amazing Christ's love is for you we are
[1:12:20] the reason why he endured all that he
[1:12:24] endured
[1:12:25] Eternal salvation and Redemption is the
[1:12:28] joy that was set before him listen here
[1:12:31] in in Hebrews chapter 12:2 Jesus looking
[1:12:35] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[1:12:37] our faith who for joy that was set
[1:12:41] before him what was that Joy set before
[1:12:44] him what was it that gave him that kind
[1:12:47] of overcoming power as a as an in as a
[1:12:51] human in a human vessel that he would go
[1:12:54] to the cross
[1:12:55] it was the joy of knowing that he would
[1:12:57] get you back it was the joy of knowing
[1:13:01] that he would have you back looking unto
[1:13:03] him and despising before him endured the
[1:13:06] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:13:09] down right now at the right hand the
[1:13:12] Throne of God he did that for
[1:13:16] you he he he had to look beyond
[1:13:21] all of the pain the shame and the sorrow
[1:13:29] amen it's God
[1:13:32] love that changed
[1:13:35] us the truest thing about you is that
[1:13:38] you're loved from
[1:13:40] God I'm telling you that's the truest
[1:13:42] thing you need to accept that you need
[1:13:43] to believe that he loves you just the
[1:13:46] way you are and he loves you too much to
[1:13:48] leave you that
[1:13:50] way you might say oh I'm in a condition
[1:13:53] now how could God love me no no he loves
[1:13:54] you too to much to leave you that way he
[1:13:58] wants to change you he knows your

[1:14:15] going to claim you you're mine he says
[1:14:17] all that the father ha given will come
[1:14:19] amen he is aware of your mistakes and
[1:14:22] sins and this is the very reason for
[1:14:25] Easter it's what motivated him it was
[1:14:28] motivated by love praise God for you and
[1:14:33] me amen he's calling your
[1:14:37] name can you recognize it this morning
[1:14:40] can you hear him calling you through
[1:14:42] through the cross can you recognize that

[1:14:47] to compromise anything to get you
[1:14:50] back amen praise God you're blessed
[1:14:55] let's look at the next
[1:14:57] slide we're continuing here in Luke 24
[1:15:01] and behold two of them went that same
[1:15:03] day to a village called emus which was
[1:15:06] from Jerusalem about three score
[1:15:10] furlongs and they talked together of all
[1:15:13] these things which had happened and it
[1:15:16] came to pass that while they con commune
[1:15:18] together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew
[1:15:23] near you know you you Fellowship around
[1:15:26] the word you talk about Jesus you you
[1:15:29] know you get to talk about Jesus with
[1:15:31] your family and your friends you know he
[1:15:34] draws
[1:15:35] near he wants you to talk about him
[1:15:38] listen here he says he drew near and
[1:15:41] went with them but their
[1:15:44] eyes were Holden that they should not
[1:15:47] know him you see God knows exactly the
[1:15:50] right time that he's going to call and
[1:15:53] and intercede in your particular life
[1:15:56] you might think well you know I I looked
[1:15:58] back and I said Lord I was 33 years old
[1:16:02] why did you wait 33 years to come into
[1:16:05] my life because he has a purpose with
[1:16:08] your past he has a purpose with your sin
[1:16:13] he says I come at that time because I
[1:16:16] need you to experience what it is to be
[1:16:19] forgiven you need to know me in the
[1:16:21] power of my forgiveness and my
[1:16:23] deliverance and my ability to to do
[1:16:26] things for you that go beyond what you
[1:16:28] think is possible and he said unto them
[1:16:31] verse 17 what manner of communications
[1:16:34] are these that ye have one to another as
[1:16:38] ye walk and are sad imagine these were
[1:16:43] disciples that had been with Jesus Jesus
[1:16:46] knew that they had been with him yet
[1:16:49] they were sad you know a lot of people
[1:16:51] they're they you know I'm a Christian
[1:16:53] but they're sad Christians
[1:16:56] they're you know they're they're they're
[1:16:57] they're you know they're Sunday
[1:16:58] Christians when you see them on Sunday
[1:17:00] they're glad if you happen to run into
[1:17:02] them on Monday or Tuesday they might be
[1:17:05] mad you know they're getting mad at work
[1:17:08] they're getting mad at the boss they're
[1:17:09] getting mad at their
[1:17:10] friends that's not true Christianity now
[1:17:13] I'm not saying you've got to be some
[1:17:16] fairy that oh Jesus saved me Hallelujah
[1:17:19] going to going to work and and and
[1:17:21] telling everybody and rebuking everybody
[1:17:24] and telling them that that they've that
[1:17:25] you know quit that smoking that smoking
[1:17:28] you're going to go to hell because of
[1:17:29] you're smoking they're not going to go
[1:17:30] to hell because of they're
[1:17:32] smoking there's only one way that
[1:17:34] anybody goes to hell and that's
[1:17:36] rejecting
[1:17:37] Easter rejecting the resurrected Christ
[1:17:41] the purpose and the reason that he came
[1:17:43] to this Earth so that he could give you
[1:17:45] and impart his life on you amen glory to
[1:17:50] God Amen let's go to the next slide
[1:17:52] praise God
[1:17:56] now as we read
[1:17:59] on I'm going to read here if you want to
[1:18:01] follow me in your Bibles that's fine I
[1:18:03] didn't put up the whole you know the the
[1:18:05] whole chapter when you go home I want
[1:18:08] you to go back and read this chapter and
[1:18:10] read it with the understanding that you
[1:18:12] that you've now taken from from these
[1:18:14] thoughts that have been coming forth
[1:18:16] here because the thought that I'm
[1:18:18] bringing here is listen the stone is
[1:18:20] rolled away and Easter changes
[1:18:23] everything amen in other words going
[1:18:26] back into the tomb going back to look
[1:18:28] for the stone and to go inside the tomb
[1:18:31] to find Jesus that's not going to do
[1:18:33] anybody any good
[1:18:35] anymore the tombs are are all the old
[1:18:37] churches you know they they want to make
[1:18:40] shrines about Jesus they want to have
[1:18:42] all kinds of pictures of Jesus in their
[1:18:44] churches but they've got Jesus the son
[1:18:47] here they've got Jesus the father over
[1:18:49] here they got Jesus the Holy Ghost over
[1:18:51] there they got the mother Mary over here
[1:18:53] they got St Christopher over there there
[1:18:55] if there's a Saint Christopher he's
[1:18:56] right back
[1:18:59] there because he's still
[1:19:01] alive sure there's individual those were
[1:19:04] those were saints that that that that
[1:19:07] were alive at one time but now that
[1:19:09] they're dead we don't pray to the dead
[1:19:11] there's no intercessor between man and
[1:19:14] God but Jesus Christ that's the word of
[1:19:17] God there is no other mediator he was
[1:19:20] the one that went to the Cross who went
[1:19:22] to the Cross was it Mary or Jesus it was
[1:19:25] Jesus who died for your sins was it Mary
[1:19:27] or Jesus Jesus Oh but but Mary can can
[1:19:31] get you to Jesus no she can't Mary is
[1:19:34] your sister Mary is is is another
[1:19:37] individual that was blessed of course
[1:19:40] we've got to recognize her position in
[1:19:42] the word of God she was blessed amongst
[1:19:44] all women to carry the body of Jesus
[1:19:47] Christ that God would come and dwell in
[1:19:50] but then she was she came to recognize
[1:19:54] herself
[1:19:55] that she needed to be uh filled with the
[1:19:58] spirit of God Amen because she would
[1:20:00] weep and cry she didn't want her son to
[1:20:03] go to Calvary no mother would want their
[1:20:05] son to go to Calvary as a mother you
[1:20:08] know in the natural but she was a
[1:20:10] supernal body that God used to build the
[1:20:14] body of Jesus Christ
[1:20:16] in we love Mary she is our sister and we
[1:20:19] are going to Rejoice with her and she's
[1:20:21] going to tell us her story just like
[1:20:24] you're going to tell your story we're
[1:20:26] going to Rejoice together Sons and
[1:20:28] Daughters of God rejoicing together
[1:20:31] around the throne I don't read anywhere
[1:20:33] in the scripture where it says Sons and
[1:20:35] Daughters grandchildren
[1:20:38] grandsons can anybody show me a
[1:20:40] scripture on that I only see Sons and
[1:20:43] Daughters period and one father the
[1:20:47] heavenly father the Lord Jesus the
[1:20:50] Elohim the beginning and the end the
[1:20:52] logos the thought of God just was
[1:20:55] expressed into the form of a son but it
[1:20:58] was Jesus Christ was God he said I am
[1:21:02] the father are one if you've seen me
[1:21:05] Phillip you've seen the father praise
[1:21:09] God and this here now you know if if if
[1:21:13] you read on and I'll read a little bit
[1:21:16] here and behold two of
[1:21:18] them
[1:21:20] um let me go on here Verse 18 and the
[1:21:25] one of them whose name was Copus
[1:21:27] answering said unto him art thou only a
[1:21:31] stranger in Jerusalem and has that has
[1:21:33] has has thou not known the things which
[1:21:36] are come to pass there in these days and
[1:21:39] he said unto them what
[1:21:41] things can you imagine he's asking them
[1:21:45] what things he wants to know what you
[1:21:47] know he wants to know your experience
[1:21:51] because you're complaining you're
[1:21:53] dealing with things in your life you're
[1:21:55] you're overcoming circumstances in your
[1:21:57] life and Jesus was supposed to be the
[1:21:59] answer well I went to church and Jesus
[1:22:01] was supposed to be the answer but things
[1:22:03] have gotten worse my family is rejecting
[1:22:06] me because I'm now believing God's word
[1:22:09] and telling them about you know
[1:22:10] doctrines of man and and and man's
[1:22:12] teachings and all kinds of you know
[1:22:14] trinitarian doctrines and everything
[1:22:16] else and in the Bible it's so clear
[1:22:19] exactly here and I'm reading it I'm I'm
[1:22:21] reading it like like it's because God
[1:22:23] has given you the ability God has opened
[1:22:25] your eyes he opens and no man shuts he
[1:22:28] shuts no man opens you need to realize
[1:22:31] that this is something personal this is
[1:22:34] something that's to you it's God and you
[1:22:38] God and you it's not about you and your
[1:22:41] church and God it's about God becoming a
[1:22:45] reality to you personal so here he wants
[1:22:49] to know what things and they said unto
[1:22:50] him concerning Jesus of Nazareth and
[1:22:53] they went on and they were talking about
[1:22:55] the you know the the prophet and the
[1:22:56] mighty Deeds that he did you know and
[1:22:58] but uh you know and and he would he was
[1:23:01] condemned to death and then you know but
[1:23:03] we trusted that you know that it had
[1:23:05] been uh uh he which should come and you
[1:23:07] know he was supposed to redeem us and he
[1:23:09] was supposed to you know uh you know
[1:23:12] bring you know Israel back to her her
[1:23:15] position and he was our king and you
[1:23:17] know they and they were talking about
[1:23:19] all of these things why were they saying
[1:23:20] all those things because they didn't
[1:23:23] believe they didn't didn't believe they
[1:23:26] didn't they didn't experience the
[1:23:27] resurrection yet there was something
[1:23:29] more that had to take place and there's
[1:23:32] more to your experience if you're not if
[1:23:35] you're not experiencing Christ from the
[1:23:38] point where you know that you know that
[1:23:39] you know then you need to go further
[1:23:43] there's something more that God has for
[1:23:45] you that's going to open your
[1:23:47] understanding and here now you know they
[1:23:49] go on and you know and then he goes on
[1:23:51] to say in verse 22 he says in the third
[1:23:53] day since these things were done and you
[1:23:56] know where is he in other words you know
[1:23:58] here they're here they are they're
[1:24:00] talking to the Lord Jesus himself they
[1:24:02] don't know that because he he didn't
[1:24:04] reveal himself to them yet but he wants
[1:24:07] them to to experience the reality of
[1:24:10] being a human and then being awakened by
[1:24:13] the spirit of God because as we go on
[1:24:17] and they found and they found not his
[1:24:19] body they came saying that they had also
[1:24:21] seen vision of angels they're telling
[1:24:23] them all these things but it was it was
[1:24:25] because there was
[1:24:27] unbelief in their experience and there's
[1:24:30] a lot of Christians that'll that'll read
[1:24:32] these stories that'll listen to these
[1:24:34] stories but they're not really believing
[1:24:37] the story it hasn't become a reality to
[1:24:41] them yet and if you go on and as we read
[1:24:44] on now Jesus he says to them and and
[1:24:48] then and then he goes on to them and he
[1:24:49] said unto them oh fools after they had
[1:24:52] explained everything that had happened
[1:24:54] and and they were basically saying to
[1:24:56] him you know we don't believe it because
[1:24:58] we haven't seen it he turns and says
[1:25:01] you're a fool and slow to heart not to
[1:25:04] believe all that the prophets had spoken
[1:25:07] people need to read their Bibles people
[1:25:10] need to go back and look Jesus started
[1:25:13] and and entered into his listen he says
[1:25:15] ought not Christ to have suffered these
[1:25:17] things and to enter into his glory
[1:25:21] question mark and beginning at Moses and
[1:25:24] all all the prophets he expounded unto
[1:25:26] them all the scriptures of things
[1:25:29] concerning
[1:25:31] himself you see if you don't go back to
[1:25:35] Genesis and read all the Genesis Moses
[1:25:39] he says he went back to Moses well Moses
[1:25:42] is the one that wrote Genesis and he was
[1:25:44] telling them about all the things
[1:25:46] concerning himself when the Jews talk
[1:25:49] about the Passover they're talking about
[1:25:51] the Passover they're talking about
[1:25:53] Easter they're talking about the death
[1:25:54] angel that would that that is taking
[1:25:57] every individual that has not applied
[1:26:00] the blood to their lives Jesus Christ is
[1:26:04] that sacrifice he is the blood that you
[1:26:07] need to accept the sacrifice that was
[1:26:10] given to you 2,000 years ago amen he
[1:26:13] started to expound to them everything
[1:26:16] about himself in other words he was
[1:26:19] bringing them back to the word he was
[1:26:22] trying to get their thinking out of some
[1:26:25] traditional day called Easter get them
[1:26:29] out of their traditional way of thinking
[1:26:32] about Easter it's Easter isn't it we're
[1:26:35] talking about Easter today but but
[1:26:37] you're hearing it a little bit different
[1:26:38] I hope it's not about somay it's about
[1:26:42] an experience he was trying to get them
[1:26:44] to look back into the word of God and to
[1:26:47] recognize that from Genesis all the way
[1:26:50] to Revelation it's his story it's all
[1:26:54] about Jesus Christ the Messiah the lord
[1:26:57] of the Old Testament is Jehovah of the
[1:26:59] New Testament it's the same God it's
[1:27:03] always been Jesus Christ amen and he
[1:27:06] wanted them to recognize it by the word
[1:27:09] he wanted them to see it through the
[1:27:11] word and he went on to talk to them and
[1:27:15] you know then they they they uh they
[1:27:18] came to a they came to the place where
[1:27:20] they had to go and then Jesus was going
[1:27:22] to leave but then they they constrained
[1:27:24] him and they said Lord no come and stay
[1:27:25] with us you know they knew that that
[1:27:28] that that that something different about
[1:27:30] him because their hearts were burning
[1:27:33] and when you hear about the word of God
[1:27:35] if it's just something if this is just
[1:27:37] another sermon this morning and you're
[1:27:39] just you know you're feeling sleepy it's
[1:27:42] because something real is is is needed
[1:27:45] still there's a resurrection that needs
[1:27:47] to take place on the inside of you
[1:27:49] that's going to bring out the reality of
[1:27:51] Jesus Christ amen and they and and they
[1:27:54] so so something started that and they
[1:27:56] invited him in and it was then that you
[1:27:58] know that he opened up their eyes in
[1:28:00] verse 31 and their eyes were opened and
[1:28:02] they knew him because he took some bread
[1:28:05] which is a type of the word and he
[1:28:07] started to open the word to them he
[1:28:09] started to unveil the word to them but
[1:28:12] it wasn't still
[1:28:13] enough oh no it wasn't enough though
[1:28:16] their eyes were open and they could
[1:28:18] recognize oh no oh now I see
[1:28:20] him but they were looking at the
[1:28:22] physical Jesus they were thinking that
[1:28:25] that now he's going to do what he said
[1:28:27] he was going to do now he's going to
[1:28:28] he's going to oh he's back so now he's
[1:28:30] going to go in he's going to go into
[1:28:32] into the Roman Kingdom there and he's
[1:28:34] going to bring his angels with him and
[1:28:36] he's going to destroy everything no
[1:28:38] that's not the plan of redemption that's
[1:28:41] not what the scripture said amen they
[1:28:43] wanted him to be the same person that he
[1:28:46] was not realizing that no they needed to
[1:28:49] Jesus goes on and tells them and and
[1:28:52] goes on to say to them I'm going to go
[1:28:53] right down he says here and behold he
[1:28:58] says now wait verse 47 and that no I'm
[1:29:01] going to go back to verse 46 and said
[1:29:04] unto them thus it is written and thus it
[1:29:07] behooves Christ to suffer and to rise
[1:29:10] from the dead the third day and the
[1:29:12] repent and that repentance and remission
[1:29:15] of sins should be preached in his name
[1:29:18] among all nations beginning at
[1:29:21] Jerusalem and ye are my Witnesses of
[1:29:23] these things and
[1:29:25] behold I send the promise of my father
[1:29:30] upon you but te ye in the city of
[1:29:34] Jerusalem until you are
[1:29:37] endued with power from on
[1:29:40] high so you mean he rose he came out of
[1:29:46] the Tomb he he revealed himself he
[1:29:49] showed himself uh they saw him they then
[1:29:53] the word word began to open and their
[1:29:56] eyes were opened as they as he was
[1:29:58] breaking the word to them but he says
[1:30:00] but wait he says you still need to
[1:30:04] receive power you still need to receive
[1:30:07] the resurrection power you've heard
[1:30:10] about the mechanics now you need some of
[1:30:12] the Dynamics now you need to experience
[1:30:15] the power behind a real Christian walk
[1:30:19] something that changes you that you'll
[1:30:21] never be the same and Easter will not be
[1:30:24] in the month of March or in the month of
[1:30:26] April Easter will be right now every
[1:30:29] single day of your life because there's
[1:30:31] a power in you that's constantly
[1:30:35] overcoming the the the the trials of
[1:30:37] this life and the sin of this life and
[1:30:40] the situations that you're dealing with
[1:30:42] and having to face as a human right as a
[1:30:46] human he says and he led them out as far
[1:30:50] as Bethany and he lifted up his hands
[1:30:52] and blessed them and it came to pass
[1:30:54] while he blessed them he was parted from
[1:30:56] them and carried up into heaven and they
[1:30:59] worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem
[1:31:02] with great joy they also returned to
[1:31:05] Jerusalem with expectation that they
[1:31:08] were going to receive a power and an
[1:31:10] anointing that was going to change their
[1:31:13] lives for good amen amen I remember that
[1:31:17] day I was listening to Pastor Simon and
[1:31:19] he was preaching on the Holy Ghost and
[1:31:22] it was just a few months that I'd been
[1:31:23] going there maybe two months and I
[1:31:25] remember and then there was an altar
[1:31:27] call and I went running to the Altar and
[1:31:30] I knew that that addiction still had a
[1:31:32] hold of me and I went to him and I said
[1:31:35] pastor when I when I went up and I stood
[1:31:37] before him I said I want the Holy Ghost
[1:31:40] I said I need the Holy Ghost because I
[1:31:42] realized that that was the only Power
[1:31:45] that could deliver me and he looked at
[1:31:47] me and he says brother you got the Holy
[1:31:51] Ghost the fact that you are so on fire
[1:31:54] and your life is being transformed the
[1:31:56] way it is he says you only need to bury
[1:31:59] that old life that's all you need to
[1:32:02] just bury it once and for all put it to
[1:32:04] death once and for all that's why
[1:32:06] baptism is only an outward expression
[1:32:09] it's something that happens that when
[1:32:11] you come to that reality of the
[1:32:13] resurrection of Easter in your personal
[1:32:16] life you will run to the water to leave
[1:32:19] that old life and you want to bury that
[1:32:21] old life listen I came out of that water
[1:32:24] all I knew is that that that I felt
[1:32:25] completely different I felt clean that's
[1:32:28] all I can explain to you I just felt
[1:32:31] clean like I i' had a really good shower
[1:32:34] amen but and then all of a sudden you
[1:32:36] know the next day there was just no
[1:32:38] desire like the thought of drugs you
[1:32:40] know cocaine was going through my head
[1:32:42] every single
[1:32:44] day because it had a hold of me it had
[1:32:46] me
[1:32:47] Shackled I couldn't wait to get to the
[1:32:49] next Service never mind
[1:32:51] cocaine I I experienced a high that was
[1:32:54] so much higher than
[1:32:56] cocaine it was so much greater it it
[1:32:59] answered all my questions it took away
[1:33:01] all those desires I couldn't wait to get
[1:33:04] to the word because it was like it was
[1:33:06] like a living water it was it was
[1:33:08] feeding me I just couldn't get enough
[1:33:10] with the word I'd be at home reading the
[1:33:11] Bible my wife would look at me thinking
[1:33:13] what's come over
[1:33:15] you where are you going I'm going to
[1:33:18] church it's Tuesday night I said yeah
[1:33:21] I'm going to church I said do you want
[1:33:24] to come no took a while took a lot of
[1:33:29] prayer Friday night Thursday night where
[1:33:32] you going prayer meeting prayer meeting
[1:33:34] what's
[1:33:35] that a lot of people don't know what
[1:33:37] prayer meetings
[1:33:40] are Sunday morning where you going I'm
[1:33:42] not going to work I'm going to
[1:33:45] church because if I go to church work is
[1:33:48] going to get taken care of you see when
[1:33:50] you come into that reality with God the
[1:33:53] Resurrection becomes a reality through
[1:33:56] an experience not through somebody
[1:33:58] explaining it to you not through
[1:33:59] somebody trying to convince you but an
[1:34:02] actual reality of Christ it changes
[1:34:06] everything Easter changes everything
[1:34:11] when you come to this amen so he tells
[1:34:15] them now watch go to the next
[1:34:17] slide now I'm going to go back
[1:34:20] here and John 7: 3 uh verse 37 to39
[1:34:25] sorry that extra 37 shouldn't be there
[1:34:28] it says in the last day that great day
[1:34:31] of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[1:34:34] saying if any man thirst let him come
[1:34:37] unto me and
[1:34:39] drink that's what he told the woman at
[1:34:41] the well I'll give you a drink you'll
[1:34:43] never thirst again and I promise you you
[1:34:46] drink Christ in the present stage of his
[1:34:49] ministry which is him now him now where
[1:34:53] would you have been back in the days of
[1:34:56] Jesus would you have been following him
[1:34:58] based on your experience right now would
[1:35:00] you have been looking for his next place
[1:35:03] where he was going to preach where you
[1:35:05] could go and witness and hear him speak
[1:35:08] would you would you been there with with
[1:35:09] just 12 that were following him all the
[1:35:12] crowds were like who is this heretic
[1:35:14] over here all the high powers and the
[1:35:16] and the and the governments just like
[1:35:18] the governments today the World Council
[1:35:20] of churches they are all coming together
[1:35:22] so that they can bring together and and
[1:35:24] control and bring everything Under One
[1:35:27] Roof you'll never bring Jesus Christ
[1:35:31] Under One Roof he is one body and the
[1:35:35] only way you get into that body is he
[1:35:37] calls you into that body it's not him in
[1:35:40] being invited into your church it's
[1:35:42] about you being invited into him into
[1:35:45] the body of Jesus Christ the reality of
[1:35:48] God and here he says if any man thirst
[1:35:51] let him come unto me and drink he that
[1:35:53] believeth on me as the scripture hath
[1:35:56] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:35:59] of Living Water but this spake he of the
[1:36:04] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:36:07] should
[1:36:08] receive for the Holy Ghost was not given
[1:36:14] what it wasn't given yet you see they
[1:36:18] had heard they had they they you know
[1:36:20] they've been going to church for many
[1:36:21] years a lot of you been going to church
[1:36:23] for many years even into this church but
[1:36:27] there's something that has to take place
[1:36:29] in your experience where the Holy Ghost
[1:36:32] awakens you out of your
[1:36:34] Amnesia because if you're a son or a
[1:36:37] daughter of God you always were it's
[1:36:40] just that there is a time and a season
[1:36:43] for
[1:36:44] everything and in that time and SE
[1:36:46] that's why God waited 33 years for me I
[1:36:48] don't know how many years he's had you
[1:36:49] know he waited for you brother how many
[1:36:51] years he waited for you sister I don't
[1:36:53] know everybody's got a testimony
[1:36:55] everybody's got a time and a season
[1:36:57] where God is going to come and he's
[1:36:59] going to call that attribute he's going
[1:37:01] to let that that that Dynamic quickening
[1:37:04] spirit that came forth on that day uh
[1:37:08] that came walking out of that tomb and
[1:37:10] never looked back he's looking for those
[1:37:14] attributes he said all that the father
[1:37:16] hath given me when he talks about the
[1:37:18] father he's talking about himself Elohim
[1:37:21] the one who created everything and he
[1:37:24] was a part of that plan Jesus was the
[1:37:26] word made flesh and you are words
[1:37:30] attributes words that are now coming
[1:37:33] into manifestation let's read on here he
[1:37:36] says for the Holy Ghost was not given
[1:37:38] yet because that Jesus was not yet
[1:37:41] glorified and even when he came out of
[1:37:44] the Tomb and he appeared to them he was
[1:37:47] not yet in his full complete glorified
[1:37:51] condition until he came down and he
[1:37:53] revealed himself to the apostles in
[1:37:55] Matthew
[1:37:56] 28:19 and he came down and they were all
[1:37:59] there when he said all power now listen
[1:38:01] to me he says all power has been given
[1:38:05] now unto me I'm now in that glorified
[1:38:09] condition amen praise God go ye into all
[1:38:13] the world baptizing them in the name of
[1:38:15] the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
[1:38:18] praise God they knew the name they
[1:38:20] understood what he said Peter on the day
[1:38:22] of Pentecost knew the that it was the
[1:38:24] Lord Jesus that's why we baptize in that
[1:38:26] name praise God they recognized but he
[1:38:30] said now listen here he was not yet
[1:38:33] glorified but understand here now let's
[1:38:35] go to the next uh scripture here or not
[1:38:38] scripture but I got a quote here and I
[1:38:41] want you to see here the importance of
[1:38:43] that event that took place in Acts
[1:38:47] 238 where they where they or in Acts two
[1:38:51] where they had to go to the upper room
[1:38:52] to wait for the Holy Ghost they had to
[1:38:56] wait to receive and there may be some of
[1:38:58] you that are just you know you've been
[1:38:59] in a situation and you're just not yet
[1:39:02] there well I'm telling you there's
[1:39:04] there's a there's a Next Level there's a
[1:39:07] Next Level to this and and if it's God's
[1:39:09] time if it's if it's the season that he
[1:39:11] wanted me to bring this for individuals
[1:39:13] that are here or individuals that are
[1:39:15] out on on on the live stream wherever
[1:39:18] they may be they might want to hear this
[1:39:20] he says and when so the Bible is
[1:39:22] manifesting again like in the early days
[1:39:25] of Christ see cuz you are a
[1:39:28] predestinated seed just like Christ was
[1:39:33] when Christ came to the Earth he was the
[1:39:35] word when they said a virgin shall
[1:39:38] conceive Mary was the word being made
[1:39:41] flesh in her day conceiving the body of
[1:39:45] Jesus Christ then his name Shall be
[1:39:49] Called Jesus and he was the word and he
[1:39:52] was made flesh God was made flesh in
[1:39:55] Jesus Christ so just like you like
[1:39:59] Christ was a seed that needed the
[1:40:01] anointing to come on him in that
[1:40:03] particular time and season you need the
[1:40:06] anointing to come on you you need that
[1:40:08] resurrection power to come on you you
[1:40:11] take a seed and you leave it on a shelf
[1:40:13] it'll do nothing but you place it into
[1:40:15] the right atmosphere and at the right
[1:40:17] time under the light of God's anointing
[1:40:20] and it brings forth life whatever is in
[1:40:23] that seed is going to come forth if
[1:40:26] there's a son or a daughter of God it's
[1:40:27] going to come forth if there's children
[1:40:31] of the disobedient one because the Bible
[1:40:34] talks
[1:40:35] about the children of the
[1:40:38] disobedient Cain's children they're not
[1:40:41] under the lineage of Christ they did not
[1:40:44] come through the lineage of Adam we'd
[1:40:45] have to go like that's a whole different
[1:40:47] teaching right there but there was two
[1:40:49] seeds there was serpent seed and then
[1:40:52] there was God seed
[1:40:53] seed and so if it's serpent seed that's
[1:40:56] why you got people that are atheists and
[1:40:58] they say I don't believe it and I'll
[1:41:00] never believe it because there's no seed
[1:41:03] in them to believe it so don't be trying
[1:41:06] to pull people into church and get the
[1:41:09] force them into the church listen into
[1:41:11] the church it's a net the word of God is
[1:41:13] a net and it brings forth all kinds of
[1:41:16] different things into the net you're
[1:41:17] going to get rainbow troat and you're
[1:41:19] going to get serpents and you're going
[1:41:20] to get
[1:41:21] scorpions but God is looking looking for
[1:41:23] his rainbow trout the rainbow trout will
[1:41:26] be able to take the light of God's word
[1:41:28] that predestinated seed and when the
[1:41:30] rain falls on a seed the life produces
[1:41:34] itself when the Holy Spirit Falls when
[1:41:37] it fell on those seed that Jesus said he
[1:41:40] chose them when be you're chosen not
[1:41:44] today you were chosen before the
[1:41:46] foundations of the world your name was
[1:41:47] written in the Lamb's Book of Life it's
[1:41:50] just an appointed time and season for
[1:41:52] you to come and all that hear the
[1:41:56] shepherd's voice my
[1:41:58] sheep they hear my voice and they will
[1:42:01] come he said so don't worry you don't
[1:42:03] have to force anybody I'm not forcing
[1:42:05] anybody to come to church you're coming
[1:42:07] because you have an experience or you're
[1:42:10] leaving because you don't it's as simple
[1:42:12] as
[1:42:13] that before the foundations of the world
[1:42:15] and they were predestinated seed is that
[1:42:17] right amen then they haul themselves up
[1:42:22] into the upper room these seeds the word
[1:42:26] now he's calling those individuals were
[1:42:28] the word and the Word was laying on
[1:42:32] there without life in it they needed all
[1:42:37] of a sudden there came a sound from
[1:42:39] Heaven as the waters begin to gush down
[1:42:42] and it actually filled all the house
[1:42:44] where they were setting and the seeds
[1:42:47] begin to grow it begin to manifest
[1:42:50] itself the word of God being manif ested
[1:42:54] do you do you see now that you're not
[1:42:56] just a Christian you are the word of God
[1:43:00] being
[1:43:01] manifested in your
[1:43:04] day and that's why you live different
[1:43:08] that's why your experience is according
[1:43:11] to the word because the word says that
[1:43:14] all that are in Christ are going to be
[1:43:16] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[1:43:18] of an eye and we shall be translated out
[1:43:21] of this dimension into another dimension
[1:43:25] and the world goes into Great
[1:43:27] Tribulation and then we come back again
[1:43:30] for a thousand years but we come back in
[1:43:33] new brand new bodies kind of like this
[1:43:36] brother's body right here you see how
[1:43:37] young he is full of life and full of
[1:43:40] vigor like just like Samuel over here
[1:43:44] nice big
[1:43:47] muscles come back with a brand new
[1:43:51] body and we're we're going to have to
[1:43:53] live here for another thousand years but
[1:43:56] we're going to live different it's going
[1:43:58] to be a thousand years of
[1:44:00] Peace amen praise God let's go to the
[1:44:04] next quote here it is the rising of the
[1:44:07] Sun and he says and now see now you are
[1:44:11] already
[1:44:12] resurrected the day you recognize this
[1:44:15] word something quickened in you you you
[1:44:18] you became resurrected when God raised
[1:44:21] him up which was Christ

[1:44:28] and now you're growing into a blossom
[1:44:30] life like he was to be resurrected
[1:44:34] completely in that last day that's the
[1:44:37] Rapture that's the body it's it's the
[1:44:40] body of Christ that goes in the Rapture
[1:44:42] it's not a whole bunch of individuals
[1:44:44] that are in all these different churches
[1:44:46] it's those that come into the body I'm
[1:44:48] not saying it's this church I'm telling
[1:44:51] you it's the mystical Supernatural
[1:44:53] Natural Body of Christ in every church I
[1:44:56] don't care where they are you've got
[1:44:57] three kinds of Believers you've got a
[1:45:00] make believer you've got an unbeliever
[1:45:02] and you've got a True Believer in every
[1:45:05] Church the true believers have entered
[1:45:07] into that relationship they realize he
[1:45:10] was to be resurrected completely in that
[1:45:13] last day your potentials you have now
[1:45:17] what do you know your soul changed
[1:45:19] didn't it your body come in obedience to
[1:45:22] it didn't it in obedience to what a

[1:45:42] they're not preaching the unadulterated
[1:45:45] pure word of God they're just dead
[1:45:48] places they're just places where people
[1:45:51] gather you might as well walk into a
[1:45:52] cemetery
[1:45:54] because they're leading you to all kinds
[1:45:55] of man's teachings and doctrines you try
[1:45:58] to tell them wait you you need to be
[1:46:00] baptized you don't baptize babies you
[1:46:02] baptize as an adult knowing that you
[1:46:04] want that old life gone and you go into
[1:46:07] the water not that you take an innocent
[1:46:09] baby that doesn't know that it's born in
[1:46:11] sin shaped in iniquity by the time it's
[1:46:14] two years old it's going to be lying its
[1:46:16] teeth off because you're born under that
[1:46:19] that that that that character you were
[1:46:22] born in sin
[1:46:23] because of the original sin that took
[1:46:25] place in the garden and that's why you
[1:46:27] must be born again the word which is the

[1:48:02] is only one that can wipe it clean wipe
[1:48:05] it completely like it never came never
[1:48:07] happened in the first place he wipes
[1:48:09] away all sin he doesn't differentiate
[1:48:12] between the sin of smoking or the sin of
[1:48:15] murder Paul was a murderer and yet he
[1:48:19] wrote most of the New Testament because
[1:48:21] he was converted to this word he was he
[1:48:25] the the the the word that was in him had
[1:48:27] to come out and it finally broke through
[1:48:30] the stone it finally broke through all
[1:48:32] the scars it finally broke through all
[1:48:34] the teachings and all the the the the
[1:48:37] the the generational things that had
[1:48:39] been placed upon him to know and like he
[1:48:42] said to know him in the power of his
