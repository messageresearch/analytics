[14:36] Father, I pray thee, Lord,

[14:42] full control of this service. Father,
[14:45] without you, we have no words to say.
[14:49] And Father, we believe your word said
[14:52] wherever two or three people are
[14:54] gathered together in your name, you're
[14:56] in our midst. And we believe you are
[14:58] here to add just one

[15:20] Uh we're going to start uh
[15:24] this evening.
[15:26] Uh we're going to start this evening the
[15:30] trip that I took to Africa before we go
[15:34] into the word of God.
[15:37] I thank God that uh was a real struggle
[15:42] for me to go to Ghana.
[15:45] But any good thing there's always a
[15:48] battle.
[15:50] Satan will never let you do a good work.
[15:53] whether
[15:55] business as a child of God or
[16:00] doing God business because God is
[16:04] interested in everything that you do.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; Because everything
[16:11] goes to the kingdom of God.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Whether money, health, preaching,
[16:18] worshiping,
[16:19] your entire life consists of God.
[16:23] Now we thank God for that. So I started
[16:26] a journey here. I'm not going through
[16:28] all the trials and stuff like that. I
[16:31] went to Ghana
[16:33] on uh
[16:35] I forget the date. As soon as I arrived
[16:38] I I arrived uh on Thursday. Friday I
[16:44] went to Kumasi right away and Sunday I
[16:48] went to the church
[16:52] and we have a wonderful tremendous time
[16:56] with the saints in Kumasi
[16:59] my
[17:01] and the one thing that was
[17:05] uh great is
[17:08] when we went to Africa me brother Kofi
[17:11] brother F we pray for a lady that he
[17:16] can't have a a child. So we pray for her
[17:21] and when we came 9 months time he had a
[17:23] baby boy.
[17:25] So that was
[17:28] I went there and I called her and he
[17:30] says he's going to go to church with me.
[17:33] So that was tremendous thing for me. So
[17:36] I I picked her up and we went to church
[17:39] and we brought that baby there. So
[17:42] everybody saw the evidence of the spirit
[17:45] of God that's behind us. So this gospel
[17:50] is not just you sitting here. It's real.
[17:53] And God came down. My goodness, we had a
[17:57] good service. Wonderful service. They
[18:00] couldn't they couldn't stop. They
[18:02] couldn't after the service. Nobody
[18:04] couldn't go.
[18:06] They we had a wonderful time. And then
[18:10] uh they want me back again but I went
[18:14] just only for 10 days. I couldn't have
[18:17] time to go there. So I went around and
[18:22] do some business for my after that I
[18:24] went to do a business of my own and the
[18:28] Lord helped me to achieve whatever I
[18:31] have to do. Everywhere I go God is there
[18:34] for me to to somebody there to help me.
[18:38] So it was good.
[18:40] Then after that
[18:44] uh I went to after uh after
[18:50] a couple weeks, a couple a couple days I
[18:54] went to the place where we building the
[18:57] church. My brother, can you put the the
[19:00] that thing down? I want you to watch a
[19:03] little video about what this church is
[19:07] building in Africa so that you all know
[19:10] what is going on, what our pastor is
[19:12] doing for every little thing that you
[19:15] place in the in the plate for the
[19:18] offering and then uh
[19:22] uh everything. So this is what is we
[19:28] accomplish over there.
[19:32] So I want you everybody to watch a
[19:33] little bit. Watch what is there.
[20:00] Yeah, this is the church now. It has a
[20:03] roof on.
[20:06] We started this church. Everybody saw
[20:08] that, right? Was just a a weed all the
[20:11] ground and just a foundation been there
[20:14] for years.
[20:17] So, Pastor Danny and the church,
[20:22] they managed to put this church. I I I
[20:25] don't know how attend this.
[20:27] [Laughter]
[20:30] Yeah.
[20:33] Yeah. I try to get everything not
[20:35] knowing I attend the camera
[20:39] said I show everything inside.
[20:56] You got I think I have a I have a I have
[20:59] a there's no audio audio on that.
[21:02] There's a voice on that.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Whatever you can hear, maybe the
[21:08] Lord can open you ear. So
[21:32] They were congregation member already.
[21:39] I didn't know that inside of the church.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; This is inside
[21:45] inside of the church. The roof is there.
[21:56] This is the inside of the church.
[22:07] This is their secretary.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; The secretary is here.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; This is the This is the church
[22:15] secretary.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; You know this girl here?
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; I have a story about her.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; That's my girl.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; This all the money that I send there. I
[22:25] I everything goes to this girl and he
[22:27] give it to the church to the pastor.
[22:31] Everything, every penny that I send
[22:33] there, she received it and gave it to
[22:36] the the pastor to do the work. That's
[22:39] why I said she is the secretary. Okay, I
[22:43] think it's okay. Now,
[22:46] uh now you see the little the the two
[22:49] pillars that was in the front. Now the
[22:52] roof is on there as we are talking now.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; They put the the roof on this. Before
[22:58] you go inside the church, there's a
[23:00] porch, small porch. Before we go inside
[23:03] the church, there's a roof on now.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; So the side and the side they they put
[23:08] in a blocks to to close that gap over
[23:12] there so that everything will be in. So
[23:15] that church is right now what what they
[23:19] doing now they are pastoring inside
[23:22] and uh now they they this week they are
[23:26] worshiping inside. See? Yeah. Because
[23:28] they have no place to worship. So they
[23:31] are worshiping inside this week.
[23:35] And you know that little little young
[23:37] girl there, the testimony about that
[23:40] girl. Yesterday
[23:42] I called a girl, that young girl, I felt
[23:46] led to call her and uh you pick up the
[23:50] phone. Last time I call her, her her
[23:53] daddy was there drunk. He she drank. She
[23:57] didn't know what she was talking cuz I
[24:00] know that her daddy
[24:03] when she was when the the the young boy
[24:05] was maybe
[24:08] eight or something like that cuz that
[24:10] time I was young. So I know her daddy
[24:14] and he was drunk. She said she always
[24:17] drank. He always drank. So yesterday I
[24:20] called her and I was talking to her and
[24:23] I said, "How is your daddy?"
[24:26] And I I said he said my daddy
[24:29] is no more drinking.
[24:32] And I said why? He said whatever I got
[24:37] she won't allow me to take it by herself
[24:40] or she she want what she get to. So she
[24:44] stopped drinking.
[24:46] And now she's going to church with her.
[24:50] Every time she go to pray she goes with
[24:53] her. And now she I talked to him and I
[24:58] said, "I'm no more the same last time
[25:01] when you talked to me. I'm waiting for
[25:04] you when you come to baptize me." The
[25:07] life of that little girl there change
[25:11] her father.
[25:13] That's what we talking about. It's not
[25:16] what you do with what you are producing
[25:20] in your life as Christian. That's very
[25:23] very important that little girl because
[25:28] some time ago I was I when I was going
[25:31] brother Simon gave me a gave me a a
[25:34] little computer and a phone that uh I
[25:39] pray when I go whoever God lead me to
[25:43] give it to I said okay. So I went I did
[25:48] I never have anything so I left it there
[25:50] in my in my place in my bag.
[25:54] So this time when I went I felt led to
[25:58] take that computer with me still I
[26:02] didn't know who I have to give it to
[26:05] and the phone.
[26:07] So when I went there after I went all
[26:09] around to see I felt led to give it to
[26:12] this little girl. So yesterday when I
[26:15] was
[26:17] talking to her dad, he said, "I want to
[26:20] thank you for for the gift that you gave
[26:23] it to my daughter. Her computer is
[26:25] broken and she's always crying that you
[26:28] you he want money to buy this computer.
[26:31] He doesn't have and I gave her that
[26:33] computer. I said, "Thank you, Lord." He
[26:36] went to the right place.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the leadership of the Holy
[26:42] Ghost. It's very important.
[26:45] And I went there another time
[26:51] to before I come, I I left over there. I
[26:54] went there one evening
[26:56] and I gather all of them speaking to
[26:59] them about about about the gospel.
[27:04] And God was moving
[27:08] mightily. My brothers, God is with us.
[27:13] When we when we speak, we speak with
[27:16] authority.
[27:18] We speak the word that God has placed in
[27:21] our heart. Is what you hear from this
[27:25] pulpit here is not just
[27:28] a talk. It's not just normal preaching
[27:32] you hear from here.
[27:34] People are craving for this
[27:38] a lot. So what you get every time you
[27:41] come to church, try to get something out
[27:44] from that. Very very important, very
[27:47] very powerful. You see us standing here.
[27:52] Don't let us become a common to you. God
[27:55] has called us
[27:58] as a minister for you and for others.
[28:02] Whoever open the heart is what he he
[28:06] will receive what is coming out from
[28:08] here.
[28:10] You're going to reach a time you're
[28:12] going to think oh you craving but that
[28:16] time you don't have it.
[28:20] Okay. So I was speaking to them
[28:24] while I was speaking to them a young man
[28:27] came. I was speaking to them for how to
[28:30] they need the Holy Ghost. They need
[28:33] their ticket and I was giving them
[28:35] samples. How I came here, I have to have
[28:39] a ticket otherwise I cannot fly to over
[28:42] here. I cannot just go there. I'm going
[28:44] to Ghana or I'm going to Canada. I need
[28:47] a ticket. So you need a ticket, the Holy
[28:51] Ghost before you can enter to the
[28:53] kingdom of God. Without the Holy Ghost,
[28:56] you cannot get there.
[28:58] Why I'm and why I'm talking to them with
[29:00] the scriptures and everything? One young
[29:02] man just pops up. So what shall we do to
[29:05] receive the Holy Ghost? Said, "Praise
[29:07] God." Hallelujah. Today what we read in
[29:11] the Bible is right in in the in front of
[29:15] me. What shall we do to receive the Holy
[29:17] Ghost? Hallelujah.
[29:20] I I was so impressed and I was so I I I
[29:26] don't know. It just came to me like a a
[29:30] magnet and the worst was coming every
[29:33] They don't want me to move cuz the worst
[29:36] was coming powerful. The Holy Ghost was
[29:40] moving.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:43] And why I'm talking all these people
[29:45] were young men and old old people and
[29:50] all of them said when we finish they all
[29:54] coming to that church. So this church
[29:56] that we see there one day
[30:00] one of you or some of you going to stand
[30:03] there and see the evidence what you are
[30:06] producing there.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Amen.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; So that's where I I I I I I was and I I
[30:16] finished. I couldn't get time and I said
[30:18] I will come back maybe if the Lord tells
[30:21] November if the Lord tells I will try to
[30:24] go there and the people that the people
[30:27] that maybe the church will be very
[30:30] almost done and I I believe a lot of
[30:34] them are waiting for me to baptize them.
[30:39] When I go there, they are waiting and
[30:42] all the people, brother Philip, we
[30:44] baptized them that time when we went,
[30:47] they all waiting for this place to be
[30:49] finished so that they can come and
[30:50] worship there. Yes. So everything that
[30:55] we do, God is doing.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Not us doing, God is doing through you
[31:01] and me. We thank God for our pastor for
[31:05] God place in his heart to do such a
[31:08] tremendous work. We will not see here
[31:11] but one day when we cross over and these
[31:15] people come. God bless you my brother.
[31:17] God bless you my sister. Where do I know
[31:20] you?
[31:21] Praise God. Hallelujah. And God will
[31:24] show you way down that village there
[31:27] where brother Desmond was born.
[31:29] Hallelujah.
[31:31] Cuz you know what excited me?
[31:35] I was born over there
[31:38] and I came over here and what I got I
[31:42] sent over there. And what I got is not
[31:45] just a normal thing. It's the gospel of
[31:47] the Lord Jesus Christ. The greatest
[31:50] thing ever happened to my life I took
[31:53] over there.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:58] My brothers and my sisters,
[32:02] when I came to this message,
[32:06] I didn't understand nothing.
[32:08] One night, I had a dream and I went and
[32:12] told brother Simon, I saw brother
[32:14] Abraham in my village.
[32:18] I didn't know nothing.
[32:22] And my brother whom me and brother Kofi
[32:25] pray for and and the Lord heal him with
[32:29] a two strokes
[32:31] his room
[32:34] he gave it to brother Abraham to stay
[32:36] there and I went with brother Bra
[32:39] and he gave his room for brother Ram to
[32:42] stay there and brother Abraham was
[32:45] thanking him for what he done
[32:49] not knowing the message one day is going
[32:53] to go there. And when the message go
[32:55] there, she he is the one God started and
[32:58] heal him.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Wow. Hallelujah.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; He healed him and the whole village got
[33:06] uproar.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; My brethren, let me tell you, you are
[33:10] not sitting here by chance.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; This gospel is real. Anything that
[33:16] happened to your life, don't take it
[33:18] granted.
[33:21] After that
[33:23] I came back that's that's my my my my
[33:27] trip was almost end. So I travel back to
[33:31] Ara day before I have to come to Canada.
[33:36] I have in mind there was another church
[33:39] that I will go and visit at Manasim. Me
[33:42] and brother brother Kofi and brother
[33:45] Simon we went to preach over there some
[33:47] time ago. I I preached that place before
[33:51] and I baptized about about 10 people
[33:55] over there before
[33:58] and I went over there.
[34:00] That's the picture there. Maybe you can
[34:02] show that picture there for them to see.
[34:05] This church is is young people.
[34:12] They they are there. Can you can is
[34:14] there any way you can make it a little
[34:16] bit
[34:22] Yeah.
[34:26] Yeah. You see brother Sam, brother
[34:28] brother Desmond.
[34:30] He's like a little kid. You see there?
[34:33] He's the one in the middle there. The
[34:36] pastor is the one the pastor is this one
[34:40] here. The one beside me over there.
[34:43] Yeah. That's brother Robert.
[34:46] See all young people, you see that
[34:49] when they begin to worship, my brethren,
[34:54] they worship,
[34:56] they bang their hand, they dance,
[35:00] everything is lively because why? They
[35:03] are young.
[35:06] Yeah. And the when the young people do
[35:09] that, the old people does that too.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; It motivate them. They all dancing.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And I minister
[35:21] over there. My brethren, the Holy Ghost
[35:24] came down mightily.
[35:28] One man
[35:29] got up. He start screaming
[35:34] and and he start screaming like that,
[35:36] screaming like and after that the pastor
[35:39] came to me. They never see that kind of
[35:42] thing in their church before.
[35:45] My brethren we standing here we look
[35:48] small we look I don't know why where why
[35:51] we look but Holy Ghost is in us
[35:56] when we go somewhere
[35:59] God honor what we have
[36:03] you have something special
[36:06] for us minister to you
[36:10] please
[36:12] do Do not underestimate
[36:14] the word. You see how the pastor is
[36:18] ministering to you your future where you
[36:21] going to be in dimensions.
[36:24] You think it's just a talking is
[36:27] reality.
[36:29] What you what he talking one day you
[36:32] going to stand there and see what he's
[36:35] talking about.
[36:37] It's not a joke.
[36:39] When I minister over there, I told them
[36:41] I said when I minister, I am serious
[36:44] because it's real to me.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; I have experience
[36:51] what what happened in the day of
[36:53] Pentecost is happen to me the same day
[36:58] today. Why I stood there and minister
[37:01] and somebody said, "What shall we do to
[37:03] receive the Holy Ghost?" Can't we don't
[37:05] read in the Bible in the day of
[37:07] Pentecost it's read we read every day
[37:10] it's happen today.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; So we are in something tremendous right
[37:17] now.
[37:19] So we had a good time. The Lord shook
[37:22] there
[37:23] and everybody
[37:26] so many people were crying.
[37:29] crying, not just like there crying
[37:32] tears.
[37:34] And when I was minister, I couldn't stop
[37:37] crying
[37:39] because my heart was heavy for on those
[37:41] people.
[37:43] I want God to do something special for
[37:46] them.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:49] And they were receiving and pulling. I
[37:52] couldn't stop.
[37:55] My brethren, we had a good time.
[38:01] And the message that I preach over
[38:03] there,
[38:05] the same message I'm going to talk to
[38:07] you right now. Total dependency and
[38:12] surrender to God.
[38:14] Total dependency and surrender to God.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't want to go to that
[38:23] right now. We're going to go to the word
[38:26] of God.
[38:27] This is then after that I came and then
[38:30] the following day here is brother
[38:32] Desmond in Canada.
[38:35] Hallelujah.
[38:37] Amen. That's why I'm tell you I am the
[38:39] happiest person in the face of the
[38:41] earth. I cannot be happy for you. I'm
[38:43] happy for myself.
[38:46] Hallelujah. You have to enjoy. You have
[38:49] to enjoy your salvation. when I finish
[38:51] and they singing a cold. So I said, "No,
[38:54] give me a happy song so that we all can
[38:57] rock like that. I have to dance in the
[38:59] presence of God and then they pull this
[39:02] instrument." Oh my brothers, like a you
[39:05] know the cockroach cockroach when they
[39:08] fall down on their back and they want to
[39:10] get up and they can't get up, they turn
[39:12] like this. Hallelujah. I had a good time
[39:16] with them.
[39:18] Yes,
[39:20] you come to the presence of God, you
[39:22] have to have a good time. Yes, you have
[39:27] to be happy and joyous. God has given us
[39:30] such a wonderful salvation that nobody
[39:34] has. At the same time, you are being
[39:37] protected by him.
[39:41] You are protected by God. Those out
[39:45] there,
[39:47] they don't know whether they going front
[39:49] or they going back.
[39:51] But God has set his eye upon you as a
[39:57] child of God. God bless you. Let us
[40:01] stand. I'm going to read the word of
[40:02] God.
[40:06] Hallelujah. I won't keep you all night.
[40:08] I'm going to give you just a little bit.
[40:10] Maybe 12:00 we can leave.
[40:15] Hallelujah.
[40:17] Amen. Because let me tell you in in in
[40:20] heaven there is no time,
[40:23] &gt;&gt; right? So we have to we have to exercise
[40:25] here so that when we go there we not get
[40:27] to get tired.
[40:30] Hallelujah. Amen. We going to read the
[40:33] book of uh Matthew
[40:35] chapter 18
[40:38] verse 1-6.
[40:42] Oh God, bless your word
[40:46] and let us enjoy this word tonight.
[40:50] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[40:52] pray. Amen and amen.
[40:57] At the same time came the disciples unto
[41:00] Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in
[41:03] the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called
[41:06] a little child unto him, and set him in
[41:09] the midst of them, and said, Verily, I
[41:12] say unto you, except ye be converted
[41:18] and became as a little child, little
[41:20] children, ye shall not enter into the
[41:23] kingdom of God. You hear what he said?
[41:26] Except ye be converted.
[41:31] If you are not converted, you cannot be
[41:33] like a little child. You're going to be
[41:35] a stubborn, you will not going to
[41:37] listen.
[41:38] Hallelujah.
[41:42] Whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[41:46] as this little child, the same is
[41:48] greater greatest in the kingdom of
[41:50] heaven.
[41:53] And who so shall receive
[41:56] one such little child in my name
[41:58] receiveth me?
[42:01] But whosoever shall offend one of these
[42:04] little ones which believe in me,
[42:09] who are the children, you who believe
[42:12] Christ,
[42:20] it it were better for him that a
[42:24] millstone were hang about his neck and
[42:27] that he was we were drowned in the
[42:30] depths of the sea.
[42:32] May the Lord add his blessing. You may
[42:33] be seated.
[42:35] My
[42:37] my topic is total dependency
[42:42] or surrender to God.
[42:45] You see the disciples
[42:49] they want they wanted to know who is the
[42:53] greatest among them.
[42:56] And then the Lord Jesus Christ called a
[42:58] little little child
[43:01] and he brought among them.
[43:04] Except I say unto except ye be converted
[43:10] and became as a little children you
[43:14] shall not enter the kingdom of God.
[43:17] Why? He said it has to be like a little
[43:20] children. You know little children
[43:24] they don't depend upon themsel
[43:28] they depend upon their parents
[43:33] because they cannot do nothing for
[43:35] themsel as we we are sitting here right
[43:39] now in spirituality. What can you do
[43:43] without the Holy Ghost?
[43:45] You depend the Holy Ghost. Otherwise,
[43:48] you cannot understand this word that we
[43:50] are preaching.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; You depend the Holy Ghost. You need to
[43:56] be humble yourself. You be you need to
[43:59] become a little child that we the word
[44:02] of God can control you.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; This little child, you know, you have
[44:09] children.
[44:12] When the child hurt or sick or anything,
[44:16] he's crying. No matter how much
[44:18] headache, the mama go there, goes there
[44:21] and pick up the child or the daddy, the
[44:25] little child upon all the pain that he's
[44:27] going through. He go,
[44:32] you stop crying.
[44:35] He depend
[44:37] the love that the parents have for that
[44:41] child
[44:43] or through the pain and the love that
[44:46] they pick up that child.
[44:49] He make that child have confidence on
[44:51] them that's going to be well.
[44:55] We
[44:57] have to become like children
[45:02] can be ruled
[45:05] by the word of God. Sometime the pastor
[45:09] will you do something and the pastor
[45:12] will call you or the deacon will call
[45:15] you and tell you this instead of them to
[45:18] humble
[45:21] yourself
[45:23] your temper rises
[45:26] nobody don't know your heart holy ghost
[45:29] know
[45:32] you can't even become that blood child
[45:36] to listen A little chestilement.
[45:40] How can you grow in the presence of God?
[45:44] This little child here, children,
[45:48] they humble themselves. The parent feed
[45:50] them. What they do? They begin to grow
[45:53] to be mature.
[45:57] When they get mature, they become
[45:59] adults.
[46:01] So do we. We come to the presence of
[46:03] God. We have to be mature in the
[46:06] presence of God. Why? By staying and
[46:09] humble ourself like little children so
[46:13] that the they can feed you. The word the
[46:16] pastor can feed you and you grow in the
[46:20] presence of God to be maturity.
[46:23] Then you can go outside and show the
[46:27] maturity in the pre what God you are fed
[46:30] from God and show it outside there.
[46:33] Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Your life,
[46:36] your life is Christian.
[46:40] You are life. You call yourself a
[46:42] Christian. Why is the Christian's life?
[46:47] Except you become that little children.
[46:51] Little children they cannot be rude
[46:55] because you depend. Cuz they cannot cook
[46:58] by themselves. They cannot grow by
[47:00] themselves. They cannot do nothing by
[47:03] themselves.
[47:05] So they depend upon the parents. So you
[47:08] have to depend upon God and humble
[47:11] yourself
[47:13] and learn the statues of God.
[47:17] Then you can grow maturity and then you
[47:21] can go outside there and show that these
[47:25] people has been with Jesus. How many
[47:28] years these disciples stood with the
[47:31] Lord Jesus Christ
[47:35] and when the Lord Jesus Christ left them
[47:39] when they go outside the life they that
[47:42] they live in the day of Pentecost nobody
[47:45] can tell them that these people never
[47:48] been with cannot tell them that these
[47:49] people why they can tell them they are
[47:52] different because they have been with
[47:54] Jesus the character
[47:57] the Same thing the Lord Jesus Christ was
[47:59] doing. That's what they were doing
[48:01] outside.
[48:03] They never live different life. They
[48:06] never live different walk. The Bible
[48:09] says when even they were walking on the
[48:12] street, their shadow
[48:16] healed the sick.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; The people believe the same belief that
[48:23] they were believing in their on their
[48:25] master when the master left that belief
[48:28] fell upon the disciples because they
[48:31] have believed Jesus Christ and their
[48:34] characteristic is the same never change.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Sometime
[48:43] we resemble our parents. You see my
[48:45] forehead. You see Rebecca forehead is
[48:47] the same.
[48:50] Why they are my loins? Are we in the
[48:54] loins of the Lord Jesus Christ that the
[48:57] people can see us?
[48:59] Are you able to manifest the life of
[49:02] Christ that is in you outside?
[49:05] The Christianity is not only in the
[49:07] church,
[49:08] it's in your work. It's outside
[49:12] restaurant. Everywhere you go, the Holy
[49:15] Ghost is in you. Are you allowing the
[49:18] Holy Ghost to manifest through you?
[49:21] Can somebody see you and say this one
[49:24] has been with Jesus?
[49:27] Sometime people sit in the church
[49:30] and when they go from the church to
[49:33] outside the parking lot, they are
[49:35] fighting within themsel inside.
[49:40] They don't want to talk to the sister.
[49:43] The brother don't want to talk to the
[49:45] brother. Is that Christlike
[49:48] your own brother or your sister living
[49:51] in the church? You fighting with a just
[49:54] a little pity thing
[49:57] that you not supposed to fight with.
[50:00] When are we going to grow in the
[50:02] presence of God and to be ripe that God
[50:06] can use us? Are we sitting here for
[50:10] nothing? We are sitting here so that we
[50:13] can manifest the love of God deep in
[50:16] that. Jesus is what love.
[50:20] Love your brother. Love your sister.
[50:23] Love anybody that comes your way.
[50:28] You will see Christ in every one of us.
[50:32] You see this little little guy?
[50:35] He didn't say nothing to the father. She
[50:39] lived the life.
[50:41] He said he's a young girl, teenager.
[50:44] She lived the life.
[50:47] What the father saw that he said no.
[50:51] What you have, I will never allow you to
[50:54] have it alone.
[50:56] I would I want that one too.
[51:00] You know how how I jump and how I was. I
[51:04] spoke to that boy yesterday. I was so
[51:07] happy
[51:09] especially when he said when you come I
[51:11] wait when you come you come you coming
[51:13] to baptize me.
[51:15] One person in Christ worth everything.
[51:19] All my trips that I went to Africa,
[51:22] one soul
[51:24] were anything that Donald Trump has,
[51:29] anything that big,
[51:33] anything that Amazon has, anything.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; One soul in the kingdom of God.
[51:41] Please,
[51:43] we are not joking. this little petty
[51:46] petty things that you don't you do and
[51:48] you can't see the c you know when you do
[51:50] things wrong
[51:52] you can't see you can't pray
[51:56] how you going to have something a grudge
[51:59] a little grudge against your brother or
[52:01] your sister and you go God bless you
[52:04] sister why why why you drawing the hand
[52:06] you you you try to pull back
[52:09] you drawing the hand you pulling back
[52:11] but because some maybe somebody see God
[52:15] bless you sister then you just take your
[52:17] face like that and you you just go your
[52:20] way. Come on brethren those things are
[52:25] gone.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; And sometime
[52:28] even the married people
[52:31] you you one of you get something wrong
[52:34] and maybe the the husband say this and
[52:36] that and that
[52:38] then they get mad.
[52:40] They don't talk to you maybe one month.
[52:44] When they see you,
[52:46] they put the food on the table. But if
[52:48] you want to eat, eat.
[52:50] It doesn't work. Brethren,
[52:55] brother and the sister,
[52:58] we do that. Let everything go and let
[53:02] the Holy Spirit have his way
[53:05] &gt;&gt; so that we can be like Jesus on the
[53:08] street.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God can manifest through you and
[53:13] me.
[53:15] It's time now. Where is the bride of
[53:18] Christ now?
[53:20] Where is the bride?
[53:24] You know when you something affect you
[53:26] like that and you come to church and
[53:29] maybe you praying the piano or maybe you
[53:32] singing or you doing something and you
[53:34] coming about, don't you know you
[53:35] releasing the spirit?
[53:38] Don't you know you receive the spirit to
[53:41] the church? The pastor can't be
[53:42] fighting. He has to fight hard
[53:46] and he cannot penetrate through the
[53:47] heart of the people because there's a
[53:49] there's a there's a block there
[53:53] that you blocking the message. The
[53:55] message cannot do whatever it's supposed
[53:57] to do. Brethren,
[54:01] those days let it go.
[54:04] God is here.
[54:06] He is talking to you and me.
[54:09] Not only one person. He is talking to
[54:11] you and me.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Let us lead the life so that we can see
[54:16] Christ in our lives.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; You know, you know the sister
[54:24] I think one time I said that while he
[54:27] was sitting down there the sister has a
[54:29] leukemia
[54:31] and he said can I pray for you sister?
[54:33] And when she prayed for that sister, he
[54:36] went to brother Abraham. Brother Abraham
[54:38] said the child is already healed.
[54:42] You have this thing in your heart
[54:43] against your brother and your sister.
[54:45] You think God going to hear your prayer.
[54:48] God will never hear a prayer. The spirit
[54:51] cannot manifest among us. How can we get
[54:54] a testimony if we don't clean oursel?
[54:58] &gt;&gt; God need his testimony.
[55:01] Let us not block what God has given to
[55:04] us. This is serious business. God
[55:08] business is serious.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; It's not a joke.
[55:13] It's not a joke at all.
[55:17] Oh, one brother sit here. Oh, brother,
[55:20] can you take can you get up and sit
[55:22] here? He said, "Oh, that's my seat. Why
[55:25] you sit me here? Why you sit me here?
[55:28] Come on.
[55:32] The only thing you need, no matter where
[55:34] what you in the church, you have to sit
[55:37] where you sit that you can hear the word
[55:39] of God. Let nothing distract you because
[55:41] Satan will never leave you alone.
[55:45] He will always do something to distract
[55:47] you and you come to the church. You
[55:50] come, you wake up and comes to the
[55:51] church, he gonna he going to smack you
[55:55] and that day you will never get nothing
[55:57] and you go back same way that you came
[55:59] in. It never work.
[56:03] This is real. We want God to use us. How
[56:08] many of you want God to use you? How
[56:10] many of you want God to use you? Then we
[56:13] have to change our life
[56:16] and let the Holy Ghost manifest through
[56:18] our life.
[56:20] Hey, the day of Pentecost is same, never
[56:23] change. Is the same, never change. Where
[56:27] their shadows heal the sick,
[56:30] the Satan see them, they scream.
[56:33] You see Paul,
[56:36] Peter and all of them. You see the Bible
[56:41] say you can be angry but sin not.
[56:46] When something happen, you talk about it
[56:50] and let it go.
[56:52] You're free. I always have something
[56:54] like if you have something against me, I
[56:58] go there, I snore,
[57:01] p you have that in there, you cannot
[57:04] sleep. You roll around. Tomorrow when I
[57:06] see him, you're going to see then you
[57:09] roll around here. Then that that time as
[57:13] soon as he tell you closing your eye I
[57:14] stand on your face. Satan will bring me
[57:17] front in front of you say it's me he's
[57:20] tormenting me. It's you tormenting your
[57:23] own self because you allow Satan to come
[57:27] to you.
[57:29] You are the light of the world. Let the
[57:32] light shine through you.
[57:36] Let the darkness free and let the Holy
[57:39] Ghost manifest through you.
[57:42] God want to use you whether you like it
[57:45] or not. You see here, listen to here
[57:49] verse six. He said he said said, "But
[57:52] whosoever offend one of these little
[57:54] ones which believe in me, it shall be he
[57:59] shall it were better for him that mstone
[58:02] were hang about his neck and that he
[58:05] were drawn into the depth of the sea."
[58:08] You have a the whole God protection on
[58:11] you.
[58:14] Somebody did something to you. The
[58:16] barrier is not yours. The barriers is
[58:19] the Lord.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; And your sister and your brother did a
[58:23] little thing for you. You said, "No, I'm
[58:25] not going to give it. I'm not going to
[58:27] release it. I'm not I'm not going to let
[58:30] it go."
[58:33] And God,
[58:37] the creation of the whole world,
[58:39] everything that your eye can see, that
[58:42] you can feel, and you can hear, you can
[58:44] do, everything.
[58:46] That's your five senses.
[58:48] Who did that? God did that. He give you
[58:51] all this thing to leave with your flesh.
[58:54] At the same time, he has promised you
[58:55] that you're going to live in heaven. And
[58:57] this little bit of thing there, you
[59:00] can't forgive your brother or your
[59:01] sister.
[59:03] How you want God to use you?
[59:06] Please
[59:08] let us be like this little children. You
[59:11] think the Lord Jesus Christ brought this
[59:13] little children here? We want to be
[59:15] heaven. We want to be in heaven. You
[59:17] want to be the the the the bride of
[59:19] Christ in heaven to judge the world
[59:23] but you your own brother or your sister
[59:26] sitting in the church or somewhere you
[59:28] cannot forgive that person or the sister
[59:32] how you going to be the greatest?
[59:36] He said ex said become that this little
[59:39] children. The little children
[59:43] the little children
[59:48] what they humble
[59:51] peace joy
[59:56] obedience
[59:58] kind
[1:00:02] they don't know nothing.
[1:00:04] You never mind how the the father beat
[1:00:07] him or the mother beat that spank that
[1:00:10] little child because don't say oh you
[1:00:11] beat your say yeah Bible say yeah spare
[1:00:14] the water and spo the child
[1:00:17] you you I I did that to strengthen my
[1:00:21] children if they want if the government
[1:00:23] were to take me he can take me they did
[1:00:25] that one time
[1:00:28] but I never for I never stop
[1:00:31] if I don't do that the Bible said dear
[1:00:33] brain is young. Straighten them up so
[1:00:36] that they can stay straight.
[1:00:39] The pastor will whip you with the word
[1:00:41] of God so that what you can be straight.
[1:00:46] This little this thing that we talking
[1:00:48] is not just talking. It's real. It's in
[1:00:51] our midst. Am I lying?
[1:00:55] Maybe somebody here is do have that
[1:00:57] thing there. I don't know. But I just
[1:00:59] fell to to minister the word the same
[1:01:02] thing that I preach over there.
[1:01:05] I felt led to speak
[1:01:09] the same way the Holy Ghost is in our
[1:01:12] midst
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; leading us. It's we who are here. We
[1:01:19] have to allow ourself
[1:01:22] to be this little girl so that God can
[1:01:25] manifest through our midst. Do you want
[1:01:27] to see God in our midst?
[1:01:30] We going to bring the future here. the
[1:01:33] love among us
[1:01:35] through our prayer
[1:01:38] and then the will get up
[1:01:42] from here. You never see if you have
[1:01:44] ever seen that.
[1:01:47] I see two times
[1:01:51] I one time I went to do a work in
[1:01:53] Toronto
[1:01:56] while I was working this man sat in the
[1:01:59] wheelchair. He almost like dead when I
[1:02:03] went. He was sitting like that. Two
[1:02:05] doctors standing beside beside him.
[1:02:10] Not doctors, nurses.
[1:02:12] The wife was the wife was in the corner
[1:02:15] talking to the man that I went with.
[1:02:18] Why I was doing I was praying my heart.
[1:02:20] I said, "Lord, is that how we going to
[1:02:23] live in this world and go back the same
[1:02:26] way?" I was praying in my heart for that
[1:02:29] man for God to do something for those
[1:02:33] people to see the power of God that we
[1:02:36] are here to manifest the Christ to the
[1:02:39] world.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; So after I after I finished my job, I
[1:02:44] went straight there to his wife. I said,
[1:02:47] "You wouldn't mind if I pray for your
[1:02:48] husband?" He said, "Oh, he's sitting
[1:02:51] there. You can pray for him as much as
[1:02:52] you want." Said, "Thank you."
[1:02:56] I went there. I stood beside inside that
[1:02:59] man. The two nurses came and I said, "Do
[1:03:02] you believe Christ?" He said, "Yeah, I'm
[1:03:04] a Christian." I said, "Come and stand
[1:03:05] here." I lay my hand upon that man. When
[1:03:08] I went, the man never he always like
[1:03:11] that. He never open his eye. I lay my
[1:03:15] hand upon him. As soon as I finish, he
[1:03:18] raised up his his head, look at my face,
[1:03:22] get up from the wheelchair, start
[1:03:24] running inside the house, start running
[1:03:26] the from here, he come here and go here.
[1:03:29] He didn't want, he didn't go back and
[1:03:31] sit on the wheelchair. He sat down
[1:03:33] suffer. And the man standing there, his
[1:03:35] wife, the wife was screaming, "Hey, hey,
[1:03:37] what's going on my house? What's going
[1:03:39] on my house?" And the man standing there
[1:03:41] his his
[1:03:46] and he came and told all his workers
[1:03:49] what happened in that house.
[1:03:53] I see I'm not just talking I see God
[1:03:58] manifesting.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; So you is not for only one for every one
[1:04:03] of us who allow himself for God to use.
[1:04:07] God will use you.
[1:04:10] Thank you.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; God is serious for his business.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; I see so many things over there. When I
[1:04:16] went when I minister everybody want it's
[1:04:21] you it's like when you eat mango Africa
[1:04:23] when you eat mango or any sweet or m you
[1:04:26] throw it out.
[1:04:28] You see the bees come the flies come
[1:04:31] they go everybody all the the incense
[1:04:34] goes to the mango there. What do they
[1:04:36] need from the mango? The sweetness
[1:04:39] inside that mango attract those bees,
[1:04:43] those insects.
[1:04:45] So do we. How can we attract the people?
[1:04:50] The sweetness of Christ that is in you
[1:04:53] will attract those out there. So if you
[1:04:56] never stay here and ripe
[1:04:59] and you are sour, how can you attract
[1:05:02] those people out there? You can. Please,
[1:05:08] we have to be sweet in Christ
[1:05:12] and this little little preies let it go
[1:05:16] and let the Holy Ghost have his way from
[1:05:19] you and me. Hallelujah.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; So that they will say these people has
[1:05:26] been with Jesus.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; This is what we want.
[1:05:32] We always talk about brother Abraham.
[1:05:35] where Abraham has power for his own. No,
[1:05:38] the sweetness of Christ was in him.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; That attract the whole world even pope
[1:05:46] he thinking the whole world a leader.
[1:05:50] Can Pope stand with Abraham?
[1:05:53] Why
[1:05:54] he didn't heal for his nothing
[1:05:58] in England?
[1:06:00] Why he didn't heal will ab
[1:06:03] the congressman American congressman
[1:06:08] when you go to India why he didn't heal
[1:06:10] the people there you think it was
[1:06:12] brother Abraham the same God is in us
[1:06:16] today
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; didn't take Christ the Christ is here
[1:06:20] right now
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:06:24] he's in you and me because it's a
[1:06:27] promise said I will be with you living
[1:06:30] in you till the end of this world. The
[1:06:33] word is end. No, we are still in the
[1:06:36] world.
[1:06:38] So the sweetness of Christ has to be in
[1:06:40] us
[1:06:42] so that the world can see we are his
[1:06:46] people.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; My brethren, the time will come. We are
[1:06:53] the pillars in this world. If God take
[1:06:56] these pillars out from here, the world
[1:06:59] will collapse.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; We are the one holding these pillars
[1:07:03] right here.
[1:07:07] The four corners of the world.
[1:07:11] The bride is holding that four corners
[1:07:13] of the world. If the rapture come that
[1:07:16] go, the pillar take out everything pew.
[1:07:22] So if you are bride of Christ, you
[1:07:25] sisters, you know your husbands, I am a
[1:07:30] h I I'm a husband too. My wife want
[1:07:33] something he comes to me. I cannot deny

[1:07:50] money. Come on, give me that paper. I go
[1:07:53] to the bank. I pay. Please come.
[1:07:58] Why do you think we we we God has called
[1:08:03] us?
[1:08:04] Cuz we are the wife of Christ. Can
[1:08:07] anything can God withhold anything from
[1:08:10] you?
[1:08:11] If you ask God, God can he hold anything
[1:08:16] from you? No. Please
[1:08:19] is we are the one getting away from him
[1:08:24] if we come close to him.
[1:08:27] One time me and brother f I I brought a
[1:08:30] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:08:31] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:08:31] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:08:31] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:08:31] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:08:31] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:08:31] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:08:31] a a cassette here. We pray a young man
[1:08:33] from Africa during the war. He was in
[1:08:38] Africa jungle.
[1:08:41] Nobody all he living was lions and stuff
[1:08:45] like that. no protection. He found God
[1:08:50] on the bush
[1:08:53] and he became mighty
[1:08:56] everything that he as he said my father
[1:08:58] my father will do this he when somebody
[1:09:01] sick my he asked my father and they heal
[1:09:04] him he did so many thing that they
[1:09:08] didn't understand you know what they did
[1:09:10] they brought him to America
[1:09:13] they tried to perfect him
[1:09:16] polish him
[1:09:18] and after a while they kill him.
[1:09:22] Don't let this word polish you.
[1:09:26] Let the word of God polish you and stay
[1:09:29] away from the things of the world
[1:09:31] and then you will see the hand of God in
[1:09:34] your life. Please,
[1:09:37] I'm sorry to talk like this, but we need
[1:09:40] Christ. We need him. We can't just every
[1:09:46] day, day and night, day and night, day
[1:09:48] and night. You going to serve God in
[1:09:50] your life and you never see him one
[1:09:53] time,
[1:09:55] just one time, you I challenge you, you
[1:09:59] just go pray sincerely to God.
[1:10:04] If God has shown me and he has shown me
[1:10:08] and he I pray and he did to me, he did
[1:10:11] for me and it was real. Can he do for
[1:10:15] you? I challenge every one of you since
[1:10:18] I go ask God that you want to see him.
[1:10:22] Moses asked one time, he said yes. You
[1:10:25] don't you don't see my face but you can
[1:10:27] see my back. He showed his back to
[1:10:28] Moses. He didn't do he did. Moses Moses
[1:10:33] was a man like me and you. He did.
[1:10:38] He was a son. Same thing to you. You I I
[1:10:42] challenge every one of you. Go tonight
[1:10:45] and praise his forgive everybody.
[1:10:49] Whatever you have against somebody,
[1:10:51] forgive that person and say, "God, I'm
[1:10:53] sorry." If you have done something
[1:10:56] wrong, approach your sister or your
[1:10:58] brother and say, "Forgive me. I didn't
[1:11:02] know what I was doing. Let everything
[1:11:04] began. Brothers, hug yourself
[1:11:09] and pray to God what you need. If God
[1:11:11] will never show you, ask one time that
[1:11:14] you want to see him. Ask one time in
[1:11:16] your life. If God will never show you,
[1:11:19] he show me, he going to show you. He
[1:11:21] show me so many times.
[1:11:24] So if he show me so many times, he can't
[1:11:26] show you. He can show you.
[1:11:30] We stood on the gospel since 1986.
[1:11:35] I stood here in chastisement. So many
[1:11:40] mistake and I grow in the presence of
[1:11:43] God. And now I am ready for to be used
[1:11:48] for the glory of God. I became like a
[1:11:50] child. I learn to be obedience to the
[1:11:55] word of God. Now God said, "Now you are
[1:11:58] ready, Moses.
[1:12:00] Go and take the people out." Now I'm
[1:12:03] ready. It's my turn. I'm going the whole
[1:12:06] world one day. Maybe I have a plane by
[1:12:08] myself and travel the whole world and do
[1:12:13] the work of God. Are you going to do
[1:12:15] that too?
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Deep within your heart, do that. And God
[1:12:19] will bless you. God will use you. You
[1:12:21] see the hand of God and you're going to
[1:12:23] be rejoicing every day. You know,
[1:12:26] brother Simon always talk about sister
[1:12:28] Natasha when he went and the demon was
[1:12:31] screaming. The demon was screaming. What
[1:12:34] is that? He didn't have no power.
[1:12:37] He said that's talk about the policeman.
[1:12:40] He doesn't have no power but he has
[1:12:43] authority.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; You have all the authority of God behind
[1:12:47] you.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. All authority behind you. But live
[1:12:53] right and let God move and you you going
[1:12:57] to be you going to be the the the happy
[1:13:01] person in your life that you see God
[1:13:04] face to face. God bless you. I have this
[1:13:06] little exitation. I hope you be a
[1:13:09] blessing to you.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; and worship the Lord. Go and be a
[1:13:13] different person. If you have something
[1:13:16] against your brother or your sister,
[1:13:17] make things right. If you want to be
[1:13:20] used, you hear this word here. If you
[1:13:24] want to be used of God,
[1:13:27] make things right and forgive one
[1:13:30] another and let the let the love of God
[1:13:33] prevail in our midst. We will see the
[1:13:35] hand of God in our midst. God bless you,
[1:13:39] brother Anthony.
