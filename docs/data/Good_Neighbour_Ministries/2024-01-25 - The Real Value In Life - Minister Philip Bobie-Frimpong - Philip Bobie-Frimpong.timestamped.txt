[22:57] will we have that with our life amen the
[23:00] grace of God is greater than all our
[23:03] sins so without wasting much time I'll
[23:08] go right to the
[23:10] scriptures um I have two
[23:16] scriptures I think the first one is
[23:21] Matthew 9 verse
[23:26] 37-38 and Philippians
[23:34] 31314 when God is say
[23:40] Amen praise
[23:42] God okay so then disciples said unto
[23:46] then said he unto his
[23:49] disciples the Harvest truly is
[23:52] plenteous but the laborers are few pray
[23:56] ye therefore the Lord of harvest
[23:58] that he will send forth Libras into his
[24:02] Harvest and then Philippians 3:13
[24:20] 14
[24:22] Brethren I count not myself to have
[24:26] apprehended
[24:28] but this one thing I
[24:32] do forgetting those things which I
[24:36] behind and reaching forth unto those
[24:39] things which are
[24:40] before I press towards the mark of the
[24:44] priz of the High Calling of God in
[24:47] Christ Jesus let's pray Heavenly most
[24:50] gracious Eternal god father I'm grateful
[24:53] that you made a way for us to be here if
[24:56] I've done anything wrong pleas forgive
[24:59] me just take me aside and speak the
[25:03] right way to your children may you come
[25:05] and bless the remainder of the service
[25:09] may your presence come and speak I I
[25:12] believe they're not here they are not
[25:14] here to hear from me but to hear from
[25:16] Heaven Lord may you speak the needes of
[25:19] the people may their needs father be met
[25:24] in the name of Jesus because where two
[25:25] or three are gathered in your name you
[25:27] pray promise you'll be in our in the
[25:30] name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen okay
[25:33] please be seated I just want to show a
[25:36] little clip about act of kindness in
[25:39] um five five minutes or so then I go by
[25:43] my title is the
[25:45] real true value in life the
[25:49] real value in Life or the real true
[25:53] value in
[25:56] life
[26:26] okay no no don't worry um I'll
[26:29] paraphrase is fine it's okay
[26:33] um I this really came to me when I saw a
[26:37] clip around the Christmas
[26:39] time about a student who has an abusive
[26:44] parent and the teacher
[26:48] when the young kid comes to school all
[26:51] the case were laughing at him because he
[26:55] wasn't concentrating getting these and
[26:59] all kind of stuff going on in his life
[27:02] and then one time the teacher saw
[27:05] bruises on his hand and he asked him
[27:08] what happened and the guy didn't want
[27:10] the teacher to see so he just ran away
[27:14] and then he left his wallet in the
[27:18] classroom so he followed up to his home
[27:21] but before he got there he realized that
[27:25] yeah
[27:26] okay
[27:34] can I get the
[27:37] volume I didn't do it

[27:44] winners of this award who had the
[27:47] biggest impact on your life
[27:50] W that's a good question there was a
[27:54] time in my life when I had
[27:56] nothing but if it wasn't for an
[27:58] exceptional act of kindness shown to me
[28:00] at a very low point in my
[28:04] life I wouldn't be standing here today
[28:07] all I wanted to do was achieve just
[28:09] enough so that I can be in a position to
[28:13] give back to
[28:14] others and finally repay back the debt
[28:18] that I owe to the man who changed my

[35:02] out and if you can see that in life
[35:06] sometime bra one time he went to a
[35:09] restaurant and the lady that was very
[35:12] poor service he gave him the biggest tip
[35:16] and he was saying that I don't know what
[35:18] he has gone through so sometime don't
[35:20] know what people are going through in
[35:22] life and we have to know how to project
[35:25] grace to the people people
[35:28] and I could realize just for the natural
[35:32] life he could spend his natural all his
[35:36] savings to help somebody in his Natural
[35:39] Life what about what God has done for us
[35:43] what about what we as his children can
[35:46] do
[35:47] back not just for natural life but for
[35:51] eternal life that he has given to us
[35:54] what are you doing with it that's why
[35:56] the Bible said that the the harvest is
[35:59] plenty but the laborers are few so we I
[36:04] know that salvation is of the Lord and
[36:07] none of us can save somebody but we have
[36:10] to make ourselves available we have to
[36:13] do our part so that we can get the last
[36:16] one in so that we can also what go back
[36:19] home and this was a heroic act of
[36:25] kindness
[36:27] but what we have goes beyond that braam
[36:32] talk about um anod V wrinkler ranker
[36:37] whatever his name is that
[36:40] he when one time Germans was attacking
[36:43] the Swiss he stood and gave his life and
[36:49] because of him the Swiss were able to
[36:50] defeat the Jans and they have never
[36:53] fought again and then when he went to
[36:55] Jamaica I told about the story about
[36:58] thees that were there the Maroons there
[37:00] was a man called quo he also United all
[37:03] the tribes and then they defeated the
[37:06] the British up till now so every January
[37:10] 6 they celebrating the
[37:12] kuo but there was one time that the
[37:15] whole human
[37:17] race were in chaos there was no hope
[37:22] anywhere because of what happened in the
[37:24] Garden of Eden
[37:27] the
[37:29] Patriarchs um Abraham and the rest they
[37:34] were seeking a city to
[37:36] come they realize that this is not their
[37:39] home something is not adding up so they
[37:42] seek a city to
[37:44] come job the wisest man in his
[37:48] day he also realized that all the
[37:53] flowers and everything they died in the
[37:55] winter they come come back in summer
[37:58] where does man go when he
[38:01] dies then when he thought about that
[38:03] then God provided a way for him and show
[38:07] him that my redeemer liveth he said that
[38:10] in my flesh I Shall Serve
[38:13] God so what I'm trying to say that that
[38:16] same God is here with
[38:18] us and there was no one who could
[38:22] deliver the human race so the cry went
[38:25] out who is
[38:27] worthy there was no one worthy no human
[38:30] being Moses Abraham all those
[38:36] patrs Enoch none of them was worthy no
[38:40] one was worthy to give up his life and
[38:43] the devil also cannot do because he
[38:44] knows that when he dies that's it for
[38:47] him so God
[38:49] himself became a human being and died on
[38:53] Calvary and shed his blood for you and
[38:56] and me and when he did that he conquered
[38:59] hell grave and death amen all those
[39:03] things were
[39:04] conquered because he gave his life for
[39:07] you and me yes Lord so when that happen
[39:11] we have
[39:12] authority over death over everything
[39:16] death has no where is the stin of death
[39:19] it has no power over you or me all that
[39:24] you have to do is accept what God has
[39:27] done for us he gave his all for you and
[39:30] me and if in Natural Life somebody has
[39:33] to give his all to bring the guy out
[39:36] from the abusive life what about the
[39:39] spiritual
[39:40] the the most important thing no
[39:47] wonder when you check the scriptures all
[39:49] the
[39:51] apostles when they realize that what
[39:54] they have was truth they get gave their
[39:57] all the man gave is everything so in
[40:02] Christianity there is no such a things
[40:04] as
[40:05] halfway either you worship God you don't
[40:07] worship him at all that's why there's no
[40:10] such as a Halfway Christian because that
[40:13] the spirit for the lisia age the people
[40:16] are look W but the Bible said that
[40:19] either you are hot or you are cold you
[40:22] cannot be in between choose whom you
[40:25] serve today
[40:27] if God be god let's serve him with all
[40:29] that is in our heart Body Soul and
[40:32] Spirit if this thing is not true then
[40:36] you live it but if it's true you have to
[40:40] give everything
[40:42] 100% that's what God requires from
[40:46] us so what am I trying to
[40:50] say that sometimes God allow things also
[40:55] to come into our Our Lives if you look
[40:58] at the
[40:59] disciples one time they were in the ship
[41:02] and the Lord has told them the let's go
[41:04] over on the other
[41:07] side go let's go over on the other
[41:11] side and storms
[41:14] came while they were going there were
[41:18] waves in the
[41:20] boat and they were
[41:23] scared they didn't know what to do at
[41:26] that time and they
[41:29] scream that was God testing their
[41:33] faith and God he test the faith of every
[41:37] believer if you're son or daughter of
[41:40] God God is going to try you to see
[41:44] whether you believe or not because it's
[41:48] God knows what he has placed inside of
[41:50] you so those trials and afflictions is
[41:54] come to your life to prove what is
[41:57] inside of you amen because Under
[42:00] Pressure it brings whatever is hiding
[42:03] inside people's heart when people are
[42:06] under pressure that's why you see their
[42:08] real colors but he being God he knows
[42:12] that you are part of him so he promised
[42:15] he never going to give you anything that
[42:18] you cannot bear amen so when the enemy
[42:21] Tri job and went to the end of his Road
[42:26] what was inside of job showed up and it
[42:31] proof for job to know that he what's
[42:35] inside of him is great the same thing
[42:37] Abraham God asked him to give up the
[42:42] very thing that he had cried for for 25
[42:47] years but his
[42:49] confidence was in God that he was
[42:51] serving that this God cannot fail him
[42:54] because when God gave him the proom
[42:56] promise he swear by himself he didn't
[42:59] swear by anybody so Abraham have the
[43:03] faith and confidence that even if God if
[43:07] that boy died God is able to raise him
[43:10] up so tonight I don't know what you are
[43:15] going through but no matter what you are
[43:18] going through in life whatever storm is
[43:21] in your life look to
[43:24] Jesus look to Jesus
[43:27] he will never fail you he will never
[43:29] leave you nor forsake you he's the same
[43:32] yesterday today and forever what good is
[43:36] a historical God to me if God cannot do
[43:39] what he did in the past to the apostles
[43:42] what good is it to me but that God is
[43:45] ever presentent T so whatever he did to
[43:48] them in the past before because I have
[43:50] the same faith that those Apostles have
[43:53] whatever I'm going through when there's
[43:55] a his everpresent help in times of need
[44:01] when the disciples got the end of their
[44:04] Road and they went into the other side
[44:07] of the ship and woke him up said Jesus
[44:09] saves us he appeared and save them that
[44:14] same God is here his everpresent help in
[44:18] times of need in times of trouble when
[44:22] Jacob was in his D desperate need
[44:26] and his brother was waiting for him to
[44:30] destroy him to kill him he did
[44:33] everything and when he met that
[44:36] angel and he cried out the
[44:40] desperation God show up in present tense
[44:44] I'm not talking about a past tense God
[44:48] I'm talking about a living God a god of
[44:52] reality a God that keeps his word a god
[44:56] that when we are praying you are not
[44:58] praying to the wind you are not just
[45:00] speaking you are speaking to a living
[45:02] being who is close to us he hears our
[45:05] hearts cry no matter what you are going
[45:08] through that God is here he's the Living
[45:11] God he's not fire in the skies because
[45:14] remember when the apostles when they
[45:16] went when that time Christ God was with
[45:21] them so they went and woke him up but
[45:25] the god that was with them that God is
[45:28] in you and in me today so you can't wake
[45:32] him up from your inside Sam bra said the
[45:35] god that they secking they going to say
[45:37] that he's in their heart because they
[45:39] said that I will be with you even what
[45:43] in you until the consumation of what of
[45:46] time so that God is in you and in me
[45:50] today he's not only with us he said I'll
[45:54] be with you even in in you he's in his
[45:58] bride he's in his attributes the part of
[46:01] him is in you now because he shed his
[46:03] blood before he couldn't live in you and
[46:07] me but when he gave up the
[46:11] ghost the first people who witnessed
[46:14] that who have that thing was the
[46:20] apostles and he became available to them
[46:24] and ever since that this promise is unto
[46:28] you and to them that are far of as far
[46:32] as the many are God shall what shall
[46:34] called so is God still calling yes am
[46:39] then as soon as God is calling that
[46:42] spirit is available for
[46:44] them
[46:45] and the end time evangelic is to what
[46:50] seek the Lost bride we looking for the
[46:53] attributes of God and and in looking for
[46:56] them sometime you might get all those
[46:58] things but what that you eyed on is the
[47:00] true bride of Christ the true that's
[47:03] what we are looking for so once that
[47:05] last one comes in we can go up amen but
[47:09] until then you have to fight you have to
[47:11] do everything that we can do to get the
[47:13] one in we have to live a life that will
[47:16] attract the people our life is a
[47:20] billboard that the people are reading
[47:22] your Epistles read of all menen who do
[47:25] think man I reading is your life my life
[47:29] so we have to be careful the life that
[47:31] we lead because you are an example you
[47:34] representing Jesus Christ I us to tell
[47:37] my daughters that you have to know that
[47:39] what you are doing is it pleasing to God
[47:43] because we are in a society that a lot
[47:46] of people make decisions based on
[47:50] emotions they see the condition how
[47:52] people are crying how they are doing
[47:54] then they go and make decisions but God
[47:58] doesn't want us to make decision based
[47:59] on emotion not based on the um not based
[48:04] on emotions or what you feel all our
[48:07] decisions has to based on the word of
[48:09] God it starts to line up of this if it
[48:12] doesn't line up with this just don't go
[48:15] ahead with it because it's going to go
[48:17] and bite you back somewhere amen so you
[48:19] have to check your life you have to
[48:21] check your decisions that you are not
[48:23] moved by um
[48:27] by by
[48:29] emotions every decision has to line up
[48:32] because decisions that you are making
[48:35] today is going to affect you by 5 years
[48:38] time so you have to make sure that you
[48:40] make the right decisions and that de
[48:43] shouldn't based should be based on only
[48:45] the revelation of the word because we
[48:48] have access to the Lord Jesus Christ we
[48:50] have access to his word we have access
[48:53] to everything we have need of so when
[48:56] you are in a situation you have to have
[49:00] a don't take
[49:01] side go to him ask him and if you don't
[49:06] lean to one side and you be H neutral he
[49:11] will make it plain because our God is a
[49:14] living God he's not God only yesterday
[49:19] he's yes the same yesterday today and
[49:22] forever his everpresent help in times of
[49:27] trouble he's God of today not only of
[49:32] yesterday amen hallelujah praise God so
[49:36] our god is awesome he's the same
[49:38] yesterday today and forever he never
[49:42] lost a
[49:43] battle he hasn't lost no case he's a
[49:46] physician that never lose a patient he
[49:48] is a lawyer that never he's a he's a
[49:51] lawyer that never lost a case and his
[49:53] name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen he's
[49:57] a mighty conqueror Hallelujah he
[50:00] conquered death grave and everything
[50:03] that same God is
[50:05] here hallelujah praise our God
[50:09] hallelujah so what am I trying to
[50:14] say the word of God said
[50:19] that God he said that all that God was
[50:24] he p into Christ and all that Christ was
[50:29] he poured into what the
[50:31] church said I will be with you evening
[50:34] you until the consumation of what of the
[50:37] time so you that Christ is living inside
[50:41] of you I'm going to read this little
[50:43] quote over
[50:45] here he said
[50:48] that because my title
[50:52] is what is the Great greatest value in
[50:58] life all this act of kindness is
[51:02] good and we should do
[51:05] them but all those things none of them
[51:09] had it's good only for temporary if the
[51:13] people do not know God they're going to
[51:17] get the reward here temporary they're
[51:18] going to feel good it's nice to feel
[51:20] good there's nothing wrong them we
[51:22] should do them but the real thing that
[51:25] value is this one here that brother
[51:28] Braham said he said I asked my wife not
[51:31] long ago I said I want to ask you
[51:35] something Hy I said what is real True
[51:40] Value Place on I believe I told you that
[51:44] do the other night what the true value
[51:48] nothing but lost souls is the only thing
[51:52] that's got any value in it
[51:56] money passes away homes Decay and go
[52:01] away everything in the Earth moves away
[52:06] the only value lasting value I rather
[52:11] have one soul in
[52:13] glory that I want to Christ to know and
[52:17] see that light of God circles around
[52:21] that Soul through all eternity my name
[52:26] to be associated with that than to have
[52:30] every penny of money in the whole earth
[52:33] cuz I have to lose it all but what you
[52:37] sent up there is eternal and that's the
[52:41] reason we are trying Hallelujah that's
[52:44] the reason we are trying to get the last
[52:48] one in so that you can leave this P
[52:51] house because there's time to go home
[52:54] every everything is set up for the com
[52:56] is the rupturing time in a twinkle of ey
[52:59] you going to be changed and be in his
[53:01] presence so that's why we are trying to
[53:04] get the last one in there is nothing
[53:08] wrong with money money is good can use
[53:10] them here for not for a temporary we
[53:12] need them but the most important that
[53:16] has value is eternal life I'm not saying
[53:20] that all of us will be able to go and
[53:23] witness and bring people but you have to
[53:25] ask God what portion do you want are you
[53:30] fulfilling in my life because whatever
[53:33] God has promised to fulfill in you you
[53:36] are going to fulfill it it's your
[53:39] portion he if you have not if you don't
[53:42] fulfill that you are not going anywhere
[53:45] because some of us God wants us just to
[53:50] pray like dwart Moody the lady that God
[53:54] used her to um bring him to Christ she
[53:58] prayed for she prayed for the boy when
[54:02] she was um giving trust doing
[54:06] everything and that minister went on
[54:09] that day only the minister and the lady
[54:11] was there and they were praying and God
[54:14] brought Dwight Moody and go the the
[54:18] Bible said that where two or three are
[54:20] gathered in my name I'm in your mid the
[54:24] preacher was preaching like he was
[54:26] preaching to like 10,000 people but it
[54:29] was only one soul and the Bible said
[54:31] that what shall profit a man when he
[54:33] gain the whole world and loses his soul
[54:36] so one soul is important for the whole
[54:39] world everything in this world so that's
[54:42] what our Focus to be our Prime Focus to
[54:46] get one for Jesus and I believe that the
[54:50] the vision statement of this CH is that
[54:52] changing the world one person at a time
[54:55] one person at a time as the teacher did
[54:58] he transformed one life and that life
[55:00] has a ripple effect so our purpose is
[55:04] transform one person at a time that one
[55:07] person up not only for the Natural Life
[55:10] which we we can help them the natural
[55:12] life but we are transformed them to what
[55:14] to receive eternal life if they are part
[55:17] of the predestinated plan of God to
[55:19] receive that eternal life so that their
[55:21] life will not be the same life eternal
[55:24] the Great thing that anyone has can have
[55:27] is eternal life that's what we are
[55:30] trying for that's what we are PR we have
[55:33] trying for to get the last one in so
[55:36] let's all get into our positions those
[55:39] that has to pray has to pray those that
[55:42] have the money that cannot go they can
[55:43] support with their money Hallelujah any
[55:45] part that you have to do your part and
[55:48] God will bless you thank you when that
[55:50] soul is hovering in heaven it's not only
[55:53] the one who went to preach or wit to
[55:55] bring him those who support with money
[55:58] you going to receive your reward those
[56:00] who pray they going to receive your
[56:02] reward whatever part that you took
[56:04] you're going to receive your reward so
[56:06] let's let's work together as a team
[56:09] let's work as a team support one another
[56:12] with our prayers support them the best
[56:15] that you can if one Falls let's raise
[56:18] them
[56:19] upen let's raise them up I don't like
[56:22] people who bring people down when they
[56:25] make mistake correct them but let
[56:28] support them yes you have made mistake
[56:32] but God doesn't want to stay in your
[56:35] mistakes sometimes God even allow us to
[56:38] see the mistakes of others what are you
[56:41] going to do with it what are your motive
[56:44] of telling someone about someone mistake
[56:48] if it's not about praying for the person
[56:50] to support him then you have to keep
[56:52] your mouth um don't don't don't talk
[56:55] about
[56:56] it because we have to be there for one
[56:59] another we have to be there for one
[57:02] another and our main plan purpose is to
[57:06] get the last one in so that we can go to
[57:09] our final destination because this world
[57:12] is not our own but I believe I'm
[57:16] afraid sometimes we have been too
[57:18] lukewarm some sometimes we are taking
[57:20] the to like Aisa approach and I'm afraid
[57:23] that God has to do something God is the
[57:27] disciples what he what did he did they
[57:29] were all feeling comfortable in their
[57:31] hopes and when their persecution came
[57:34] they have no place to go they ran and
[57:37] then they spread the gospel so God if we
[57:41] do not become desperate he going to
[57:44] bring the the condition to make us
[57:46] desperate so that we have to fulfill
[57:49] what he has ordained us to fulfill
[57:51] because even your unbelief cannot stop
[57:54] God whatever God has ordained you to
[57:57] fulfill your unbelief whatever you do it
[58:00] will never hinder God that thing will
[58:03] come to pass remember Zakaria in the
[58:05] Bible God promised him you going to have
[58:08] a son he doubted he suffered for a while
[58:12] but that promise came through him he
[58:14] couldn't run away from that
[58:17] promise so that same God is here with us
[58:20] tonight amen he's the same yesterday
[58:23] today and forever
[58:25] and back to the the the disciples in the
[58:28] ship I think they forgot that the god
[58:33] that created the storm the god that
[58:36] created the rain was in their midst and
[58:39] they began to shake tonight I don't know
[58:42] what you are going through but I want to
[58:44] tell you tonight whatever
[58:47] sickness whatever things that is
[58:49] bothering you the creator that created
[58:52] you is greater than that sickness
[58:55] that sickness has to bow down to the
[58:58] creator that created you no matter what
[59:00] you are going through the Creator the
[59:03] creator of who created everything is
[59:05] greater than everything every knee has
[59:08] to Bow every tongue Jesus Christ is God
[59:11] every sickness every oppression every
[59:14] financial problem it has to bow down in
[59:17] the name of Jesus because the Creator is
[59:20] here to bring your needs to pass he's
[59:22] the same yesterday today for forever
[59:26] everything has to bow down to him so
[59:29] those are subject to him he's the
[59:32] Creator the Creations canot have power
[59:35] over the Creator so don't worry about
[59:38] what you are going through just commit
[59:40] to Christ Jesus amen he going to bring
[59:42] it to pass because our God hasn't
[59:45] changed he's the same yesterday today
[59:48] and forever amen the problem of it is
[59:52] sometimes the leaders
[59:56] Jesus Christ Moses all those who they
[59:59] have problem with the leaders in their
[1:00:01] time who were bringing doubts and things
[1:00:05] to the people in the time of Jesus the
[1:00:08] Pharisees and the sadu they were the
[1:00:10] leaders and they
[1:00:13] were what criticizing the very thing
[1:00:18] that God said it was going to come
[1:00:20] because most said that the Lord God will
[1:00:22] raise a prophet onto like me and when he
[1:00:25] came he fulfill everything that mes talk
[1:00:28] about him but they criticized that
[1:00:32] because it wasn't according to what
[1:00:35] their way of thinking it wasn't
[1:00:38] according to their culture how they have
[1:00:40] what been brought up but his everpresent
[1:00:43] help in the time of trouble those who
[1:00:47] were ordained to life the 120 out of
[1:00:51] millions they went to the upper room to
[1:00:53] receive the pro promise because they
[1:00:55] were God's children for that day and
[1:00:58] that same God is here tonight he hasn't
[1:01:02] change amen he's the same yesterday
[1:01:06] today and forever he'll bring everything
[1:01:10] to pass so what am I trying to say is
[1:01:13] that God is an awesome God he's up to
[1:01:19] something big and I am part of it and
[1:01:23] you are part of it
[1:01:25] amen
[1:01:26] hallelujah praise God
[1:01:29] hallelujah amen every knee shall bow
[1:01:32] every tongue confess that Jesus Christ
[1:01:35] is God
[1:01:37] hallelujah amen praise our wonderful God
[1:01:41] thank you Jesus amen hallelujah so what
[1:01:46] I was trying to say is that the Bible
[1:01:47] said
[1:01:49] that greater than this shall you also
[1:01:53] what do
[1:01:55] greater
[1:01:57] way
[1:01:58] because we know that no one can do
[1:02:00] greater than God we did what it's more
[1:02:05] many member body we can do more so the
[1:02:09] emphasiz I'm trying to see trying to say
[1:02:11] that
[1:02:13] as Christ was with the
[1:02:17] disciples now in our time he is in
[1:02:22] us so if God is in us then God is trying
[1:02:27] to tell us that um Greater
[1:02:32] Works than this shall you also do he
[1:02:36] said that now
[1:02:37] notice the greater W was to have the
[1:02:42] power in the
[1:02:44] church not
[1:02:46] only to heal the Sick by
[1:02:50] prayer cast out Devils by prayer
[1:02:55] but to impart eternal life to
[1:03:00] Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and
[1:03:04] given into the hands of the church the
[1:03:06] bride to impart life oh that's what
[1:03:12] Calvary meant it took St degraded men
[1:03:17] and women and lifted them into a place
[1:03:21] to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal
[1:03:25] the sick and to impart eternal life by
[1:03:30] giving the Holy Ghost to obedience
[1:03:33] Believers men who were once unbelievers
[1:03:37] be made Believers and impart spiritual
[1:03:41] eternal life in other words you are an
[1:03:43] amature
[1:03:45] God you have that path of God in you to
[1:03:50] impact eternal life that impact of
[1:03:53] eternal life for you
[1:03:55] you for God to use you to bring somebody
[1:03:58] in so that the person receive the same
[1:04:01] holy ghost that you
[1:04:04] have so that his life will have a
[1:04:08] purpose in life because remember the
[1:04:11] only true
[1:04:13] value is for someone to have the life
[1:04:18] eternal all the rest is just temporary
[1:04:23] amen all the rest is just temporary one
[1:04:27] time David was worry and
[1:04:32] thinking that
[1:04:34] why the prosperity of the
[1:04:37] ricked in Psalm 74 if I can find it
[1:04:45] was2 Psalm 74
[1:04:49] 72 73 okay
[1:04:52] yeah Psalm 7
[1:04:59] new Bible
[1:05:06] here Psalm
[1:05:22] 73:26 yeah
[1:05:29] okay Psalm 23 truly God is a good to
[1:05:33] Israel even to search as of clean heart
[1:05:35] but as for me my feet were almost gone
[1:05:38] my step had well nice sleep for I was
[1:05:43] envious at the foolish when I saw the
[1:05:46] prosperity of the
[1:05:49] wicked for there are no binds in their
[1:05:52] death but their strength is firm they
[1:05:56] are not in trouble as other men neither
[1:05:59] are they plagued like other
[1:06:02] men therefore Pride Compass them about
[1:06:06] as a chain violence covered them as a
[1:06:09] garment their eyes stand out with
[1:06:12] fatness they have more than heart could
[1:06:15] wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly
[1:06:19] concern oppression they speak
[1:06:22] lofly they set their mouth against the
[1:06:25] heavens and their tongue walk through
[1:06:28] the Earth therefore his people return
[1:06:31] hither and water of and Waters of full
[1:06:34] cap are run out to them and they say how
[1:06:39] do God know and is there knowledge in
[1:06:42] the most
[1:06:43] high behold these are the ungodly who
[1:06:47] prosper in the world they increase in
[1:06:50] riches very I have cleansed my heart in
[1:06:54] in vain and wash my hands in
[1:06:57] innocency for all the day long have I
[1:07:00] been plag and chasten every morning if I
[1:07:03] say I'll speak th behold I should offend
[1:07:06] against the generation of the children
[1:07:07] when I T to know this it was too painful
[1:07:10] for me until I went into the sanctuary
[1:07:14] of God then I understood their end in
[1:07:18] other words David was envious of the
[1:07:21] prosperity of the wicked but when he
[1:07:24] went in the sanctuary of God then he
[1:07:26] know their end so what I'm trying to say
[1:07:30] that don't
[1:07:31] worry God promised that we going to
[1:07:34] leave you of the great
[1:07:35] substance but the wicked they get more
[1:07:39] than even what their hands even wor but
[1:07:42] when he went to the sanctuary of God he
[1:07:45] know because they have their life will
[1:07:47] come to an end for temporary for a short
[1:07:50] time but
[1:07:52] ours
[1:07:54] is what
[1:07:56] Eternal Eternal has no
[1:07:59] end that's the main thing that's what
[1:08:03] has value because the prosperity of the
[1:08:06] wicked is only for short time
[1:08:10] here but our prosperity he said that
[1:08:14] above all things I wish you prosper and
[1:08:16] be in health even as your so what
[1:08:20] prospered amen prosperity in all three
[1:08:24] areas but they got that Prosperity just
[1:08:28] the natural thing and it comes to an end
[1:08:32] so the red thing that has value is what
[1:08:35] we should strive for what we should try
[1:08:39] to bring the last one in so that we can
[1:08:43] live from here and go to our
[1:08:47] reward amen that's all it is for
[1:08:51] tonight amen hallelujah I think that's
[1:08:54] all has
[1:08:55] value Hallelujah nothing else and
[1:08:59] also what really strike me you can come
[1:09:02] right through me that I count on myself
[1:09:05] to have apprend apprehended but this one
[1:09:08] thing I do forgetting those things which
[1:09:11] are behind and reaching forth onto those
[1:09:14] things which are before I press towards
[1:09:18] the mark for the price of the High
[1:09:20] Calling of God in Christ Jesus say that
[1:09:24] means that we have to press on and leave
[1:09:27] our everything behind 2023 is gone but
[1:09:33] 2024 I have purpose in my heart that I
[1:09:36] rededicate my life I reconsecrate my
[1:09:39] life I will try and seek the
[1:09:44] loss the best that I can and let God
[1:09:48] bring them to what to the right person
[1:09:50] because remember
[1:09:52] AER I know he types the messenger but
[1:09:57] when Abraham told him to go and look for
[1:10:02] a bride for his son he what he prayed
[1:10:07] first so if we do everything by prayer I
[1:10:12] believe that God will direct us to the
[1:10:16] right person at the right time who needs
[1:10:20] to be because remember I said no one
[1:10:23] there
[1:10:24] join the church and let God what add
[1:10:27] them to it it's all about God's doing
[1:10:30] but we just going to make ourself
[1:10:33] available so that he can use us and
[1:10:36] bring the last one in that's the only
[1:10:39] thing that has True Value that's all I
[1:10:43] have for
[1:10:46] [Applause]
