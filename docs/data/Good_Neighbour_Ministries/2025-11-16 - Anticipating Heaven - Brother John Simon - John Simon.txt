Justified. Thanks be to [music] God. God bless you. We're happy to be here today. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Please be seated. What a blessing to be here with you this morning by God's grace. And it means more when you say those words when you're older. It's a blessing to be here just to be in the presence of God's people and the privilege of being able to speak to his bride uh talk to his people and I haven't come with any earthshattering revelations but just to talk with you and let's fellowship around the word of God. Welcome to everyone that's here today and may God's great Holy Spirit minister to us in simplicity, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Um I'm not uh I shouldn't say that. I was about to say I'm not uh preaching the token, but um I'm I'm trying to apply the token. Um and may the Holy Spirit take the word of God and apply it to your heart. Right. Praise God. I'm speaking the word of God so that it may come to your heart because this is a day where um the revelation has moved from the days of the missionary works of of the feat and it's gone up uh into through Luther Wesley right into Pentecost with the stammering lips and into the prophetic vision of the prophet the eyes of the body. And then now we are in the mind age where the Holy Spirit is moving in the uh in the realm of revelation to your mind to your soul where you can understand what he's trying to speak to you. Amen. So God being a spirit that you know he can speak with an audible voice but that'll more scare you. So he'll speak to you in your thoughts and all of a sudden he'll drop a word. He'll drop a thought and you've seen that. It happened to every one of us. You're just going along and a thought just is why you shouldn't go down that way anymore. Go this way. And we say, "Oh no, I'll just go." And you continue going and you get into trouble and say, "Oh my, I should have listened to my thoughts." But that wasn't your thoughts. That was God's thought. But you just didn't listen at the moment. Amen. So, we should be very, in the words of the prophet, be conscious of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be aware of his presence. &gt;&gt; Be always aware of him speaking to you. Praise the Lord Jesus. And may the great Holy Spirit of God make us all conscious and aware of his divine presence that he's alive forever more. He'sn't dead. Uh uh you physically maybe his body isn't here, but his spirit is here. &gt;&gt; I believe his presence of the Lord is here. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Praise the Lord. When the Lord comes on the scene like this, then you know, anything can happen, &gt;&gt; right? I've said it before, say it again. I've been talking just like this and uh next thing you know, a brother in the congregation just coughed up the cancer on the floor, right? What's got to do with me? That doesn't mean I should put a magazine and put it on the internet and all that. And that's happened so many times. The dead has been raised in this church &gt;&gt; more than once. &gt;&gt; And there's no big thing about it because it's the works of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not to point to a man or to point to any place. It's to point back to him. &gt;&gt; Get yourself out of the way and let God receive all the praise, the honor, and the glory. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I was down in South Carolina. I was in the middle of preaching, preaching, preaching and talking like that. And a lady ran up to the front and said, "Oh God, give me my husband. Give me back my husband." Her husband had left her. And oh my, a believer. And before I could think a voice, I give you your husband before morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. I was so scared because I said, "Lord God have mercy. Now my ministry is going to be in shambles." 4:00 in the morning. Bang bang bang bang bang. I woke up, opened the door. So what? What's What's the noise? What the the lady's hus the pastor himself came. The lady's husband came back. He he walked across that whole American city in the pouring rain. something drove him right back to his home. &gt;&gt; He became born again. He became a deacon. And he was a believer even more, I should say that, even more than his wife [laughter] until he died. Oh, praise God. Do you believe him? &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He doesn't fail. He is God. &gt;&gt; You see, we we don't preach the gospel like it's back in the Bible days. It's an imaginary story of Jesus or the apostles. Let me tell you, the apostles are here. &gt;&gt; The pastors are here. &gt;&gt; The evangelists are here. &gt;&gt; The same Holy Spirit is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said, "Do you realize that the same sun that's shining over you today &gt;&gt; is the one that shined over Adam?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; It's the same son. &gt;&gt; In the same way, we It's the same God &gt;&gt; and he's here with us &gt;&gt; every step of the way. We just have to get ourselves out of the way, relax, and let him have his way. Praise the Lord. Now, um, of late, a lot of believers have been passing on to go and be with the Lord. How many knows that? The last, uh, one I know about is Brother Biscll. He's left great warriors left and gone to his rewards. Many more before him, right? Even in our local church, you know, Sister Johnson has gone on, this one has gone on, the other one passed on, gone to be in the presence of the Lord. Yes. Because we've come to the crossing. And and now uh some of the older ones have are passing on while you younger ones enter into the new land. Uh led by the Holy Spirit. uh Joshua of this hour &gt;&gt; entering into the wars uh entering and taking cities and strongholds for the glory of God. It may not seem like that, but it's happening spiritually. Is that right? It's happening spiritually. Now, your battles may be a little different than we had it back there, but it's the same kind of pressure, right? uh and God has got to come on the scene and that is why he gave us hope that we are not following him in vain. &gt;&gt; Uh uh we're not following an imagination &gt;&gt; but we are following God with a certain hope and faith in his word. I want to speak today on anticipating heaven. living in a state of anticipation of heaven. Praise God. Our scriptures if the brothers will begin uh will be John uh 14 1-3 and 1 Corinthians 2 verse 9. And let us stand and read it all together. For faith comes, revelation comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be &gt;&gt; also. 1 Corinthians 2:9, as it is written, I had not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that loved him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have stuff prepared for you before you got there. you get there. &gt;&gt; Uh stuff that you can't imagine, you can't even start thinking and trying to analyze and find. I wonder what God is keeping in secret for me so that when I get there, uh uh you know, like a husband trying to surprise his wife, he he's got some things prepared. So So I'm anticipating heaven. &gt;&gt; God bless you. A gracious heavenly father, how wonderful for us to talk about your things that you have made known to us. Father, when we as we gather like this, just bless us together. Lift us up for a for a hour or two into your presence that we might consider the things of God, consider our soul, consider our lives, consider our future and our walk with God. For we ask it in the name of our blessed Lord and precious savior Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. Please be seated. [clears throat] You know um there's a beautiful song. So most of you or many of you may know it says how beautiful heaven must be. Sweet home of the happy and free. Fair haven of rest for the weary. How beautiful heaven must be. Amen. Yes. And heaven is a beautiful place. How many will believe that? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We had one sister. Some of you around still know about her. uh that's uh went uh off under operation. She went to be with the Lord pronounced dead. They write wrote it up dead. But while they were writing it up, she was far away in the presence of God. And there she was able to meet with Abraham and talk to her. And and she loved the presence of God and the presence of the people so much. She wanted to stay there. And Abraham, that's what she said, told her, "No, you have to go back. Your purpose on earth is not done." And with that, she find herself back on the bed and awake and the doctors shouting and wondering to know what happened. [laughter and gasps] Praise the Lord. But we know what happened. &gt;&gt; Though he were dead, yet shall he live. M there was a a brother by the name of brother Morris and he died at about 84 years old in California in February. Uh and when he died he said these words, I die in peace with all men. I shall soon be with the angels. And that's with every one of us. absent from the body, you're present with the Lord. &gt;&gt; There is no intermediary state. There is no need for prayer uh to pray you out of purgatory because Paul said absent from the body, present with the Lord. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm seeing some saints that I haven't seen for a while, but I I I can't stop now to say God bless you. We welcome you. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, we know that this brother died with peace of mind. And every one of us, if that time comes, praise God, we want to die with peace of mind. We don't want to die haunted and horrified by what is laying in the great beyond. But we want to die with peace of mind. Everybody wants it. Praise God. Hallelujah. Why? Why is it? Because we live in a world where there's hardly any peace. People's minds are not at ease. They don't have peace of mind. They're troubled. They're worried. They're fearful. They're nervous. They And they they don't know why the world is a in a pressurized situation now. And everyone Christian or non-Christian, you feel the pressure of the darkness around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know it is there for a fact. Amen. And most people are under that kind of pressure, even Christians so-called, because of the sins they committed and their own guilt, their own conscience that they're wrestling with every day. You can say, "No, I don't." But the moment you get a quiet moment, you'll hear that voice say, "You know, you shouldn't have done that. you show you, you know, you shouldn't have done this. You know, you were wrong when you said that. You shouldn't have answered that person in that way. You shouldn't have, you know, you know that that's not just your thoughts. It's God speaking to you and then you'll shake it off and you want to continue on with that kind of a life, right? And so they're wrestling with their conscience, fighting all the time, with their guilt. And then many others can't find peace. As one uh brother was telling me, he was in a certain Christian denomination. They gave him a high position where he's organizing some people and stuff like that, but yet he can see the wickedness of the priests. He could see the corruption and all of that going on. And some of those people in those places, they [screaming] are their spirits are filled with fear, with doubt, with trouble. Right? It's the wicked systems in the world. &gt;&gt; Even the governments in the world have their citizens under pressure. Uh uh their minds are pressurized. The they're in a state of constant tension. Uh uh they don't know how to get out of it. They're caught in the web of a worldly system. right now in India many years ago, brother Brandham spoke of it. He said, "Do people notice animals moving away from the fences and the buildings and uh going out in the fields under a tree or something, but they'll stay away from walls and buildings and everything else. And and dogs begin to bark and howl and animals begin to run like something is wrong with them. But what was it? They were sensing the coming of impending judgment and disaster. It was an earthquake that was on the way. &gt;&gt; And the animals could sense it before the humans. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh my God says the stor knows the way my ways of my coming, but the people knows not the judgments of the Lord. They they can't seem to find sense it. The judgment is coming. &gt;&gt; I said judgment is coming. &gt;&gt; Payday is coming. &gt;&gt; Every one of us will have to pay for the sins we have done in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter who we are, we'll have to pay for it. Amen. Yes, sir. So, the world is in that state. Amen. Brother Brandham said it like a boy whistling through a graveyard. Let me have the next quote. Praise the Lord. Up there, brother. Praise the Lord. Amen. Yes, sir. One minute, please. Brother Brandham says, "It reminds me of this these comedians now. They're telling a lot of jokes, carrying on, women carrying on the way they do, and men together. It just reminds me like a little boy going through the graveyard whistling trying to make himself believe that he's not scared. Sure, he's scared. See, he ain't fooling nobody. That's why he's whistling. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; He's trying to say he's not scared, but he is. And that's what's the matter today with today. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, when I was young and I read that, I started laughing because the same thing had happened to me. We as boys had gone to the cinema to see Frankenstein. How many knows? I know it's an old thing with Frankenstein, the monster movie, not realizing that the cinema show would end very late. And when it ended late, we had to get home. And to go home, we were in one tongue. And to get to my tongue, there was a mile long graveyard, no lights, [laughter] it was dark. So we're I'm walking I'm walking, but because I'm short now and think of how short I was there at 12. [cough] [laughter] And as as I was walking, I noticed some adults ahead of me and they were talking and walking and going on. So I try to keep up with them so I can have some company through the graveyard. But their feet are longer and they're walking faster and they start walking away from me and before I know it, I'm left in the middle of this graveyard and nobody around. So what do I do? I start whistling. [laughter] So you can imagine when I read brother Brandham saying this, how that felt to me. Amen. So I was whistling in the graveyard trying to come out of there safely like that. Amen. Yes, sir. But that's what the world is doing. &gt;&gt; They're trying to drink themselves drunk so that they their conscience wouldn't speak to them. It wouldn't talk to them and tell them, "You're wrong. You're guilty. Get out of that thing. Amen. Come out of your filth and your corruption. Oh [screaming] my god. They they Oh, they'll run over there and use some drugs or they'll run over here and they'll they they'll get a woman or they'll drink some wine or or they'll take something over there that will just distract them only for a brief time and they're back where they started. Amen. But that's the age that we are living in. Amen. Yes. While the people are like that, the whole world is guilty. The whole world [screaming] is facing doom. &gt;&gt; And they could sense it. Amen. And so they're whistling and they're having jokes on the TV, laughter, and lots of sports events to distract. The devil just wants to distract the people. Uh sports events. Wonderful. Yay. Everybody's shouting and everything else. Nobody's throwing their hats and caps up for Jesus. And if you do in the church someone to condemn you said you gone Pentecostal, you're too emotional. You should speak very, you know, controlled a proper way of after dinner speeches and lectures and stuff like that. Not knowing that God builds us people differently. We we we are just individuals &gt;&gt; and God will shine the light of his revelation through the prism of your personality &gt;&gt; and the light or the revelation or the words that's coming out of it is coming out with so many pieces uh like when a star is twinkling in the sky is not one color. You could look at the star and see it's purple, it's pink, it's yellow, it's all coming out at the same time because the light strikes it. Amen. And it reflects that light back. Praise God. He, the prophet of God, said this the same way. The messenger catches the light. It strikes him. Shines it back into the church age. &gt;&gt; Back into the church age. Praise the Lord. Even so is your little life. God's light strikes it and then it shines back out to the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Sometimes it's a literal light just like it was with brother Brandon. Sometimes it's just a spiritual light. Amen. You know, you've had that where this fellow came and said, "Oh my god, there's a light around you. They sent me to me to sent me to you to tell you." I said, "They sent you to me?" No. No, I said you made a mistake. I am sent to you to tell you that I see flames in your future. Of course, he [clears throat] ran away. Praise the name of the Lord. Praise God. You see, so this is the way it is. This is the age that we are living in and these things are all around us. People are living in constant fear. Fear of break and enter, fear of shootings, fear of somebody stabbing you with a knife, fear of getting on the bus, fear every time there people are afraid. They're living in dread. Listen, I lived in New York City and you talk about a pressure cooker. You walking and you constantly have to be looking over your shoulder or whatever to make sure you don't have a sign on your back saying, "Please mug me or rob me. &gt;&gt; [laughter and clears throat] &gt;&gt; you. It's just you're walking with like a almost like that you're under a pressure cooker all the time. Somebody is trying to get at you in some way or the other. Amen. Yes, sir. Praise God. But I'm so happy that I found Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and he has made a change in my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The people are being [screaming] tormented by the devil himself. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, brother Simon? Prophet said, "It shall come to pass the whole world will go insane." &gt;&gt; What do you think that is? It's devils tormenting the people, &gt;&gt; tormenting their minds with depression. Brother Gabe, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; The tormenting their minds with all kinds of of guilt, with shame, with this, tormenting them constantly all the time, tormenting them with disease, tormenting them with afflictions, tormenting [screaming] them with nervousness, nervous breakdowns. How many of you are hearing more and more nervous breakdowns? Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh uh uh brother Gabriel knows about this uh in his community where the people are a little up and up uh and their children will have no need of nothing. And yet you find they're hanging themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hanging themselves for what? They don't need nothing. I mean financially stable, everything is fine. The future is fine. And yet they're hanging themselves. &gt;&gt; Is that right? What's going on? &gt;&gt; What madness is this? This this devil doing that to the minds of the young people, &gt;&gt; getting their minds all mixed up and and and all in a tizzy of that way. Physical and mental disturbances. Amen. Praise God. But I'm glad that I serve a God who is able. &gt;&gt; He is able. And uh uh while I'm talking, I don't care what you're suffering from, what trouble you have, what problem you have. God can answer your problem [screaming] if you will pray while I am preaching. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me this. Give me my husband. [screaming] I claim this. I claim that in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And God will give it to you. Not because of my faith, I'm going to give it to you. No, because your faith. Talking to God. God knows. He can hear all of us. Even while the service is going on, &gt;&gt; can God listen to a 10,000 people? He's listening to the whole world &gt;&gt; and he knows everything. And he's hearing you. Even your whisper, your secret thoughts, God knows all about it. Nothing is hidden from him. Just talk to him. It's as simple as that. and said, "Lord Lord, uh, bless me. Lord, forgive me. Lord, provide this for me. Lord, I need this. I need this." Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And God will do it for you. Amen. [clears throat] And if the world goes on the way it is, we know where it's headed. Brother Brennham said it clearly in another quote. There is no future but the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. No future. Listen, my friends, there we don't have no future. Cuz if God just tears up and destroys everything, where is your future? Our hope is in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our hope is in his promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place for you &gt;&gt; that where I am, you may be also. &gt;&gt; We don't just die and take a leap in the dark. &gt;&gt; Hoping that we go somewhere. We know where we are going &gt;&gt; because God made a promise &gt;&gt; I [screaming] go to prepare a place for you &gt;&gt; that where I am, you may be also. &gt;&gt; You'll be in a body like I am in this body and you'll be in the same location where I am also. I'm I've gone to prepare a place for you. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And your change has already started. &gt;&gt; Thank you, God. The prophet said, "You know that." He says, "You you're changed already." He says, "Once you were there in sin and now what? You're justified." He says, "What is that? You're out. You've come out of the world. You're already almost your lift off to glory already started. &gt;&gt; It it's so uh it's so gentle that you don't realize it, but the rapture is now in progress." &gt;&gt; Is that right? Praise God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I tell you. Praise God. The flashing red lights of his coming. All the signs are all around. And let me tell you friends that the train is coming in the station. &gt;&gt; And you better be ready to get on the train &gt;&gt; because this train is bound for glory. &gt;&gt; Get on the train. Don't miss this train. &gt;&gt; You must be on the train because it's going to take you right into glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, we all love home. And I love home. And I love the homeland that I come from. How many of you love the homeland you come from? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. You know, the cowboys used to call heaven the corral with ghost riders in the sky. the Indians, these princes of the plains. Uh, and we call them in Canada the first nations, the first people, right? Uh, here the the happy hunting grounds. Amen. And then that's how they can imagine themselves happy and just free and hunting anywhere they want to. and and and that's how they believe heaven is going to be uh like the Arabs call it simply call it paradise. Say heaven is like paradise. Some call it the chapel in the sky. Some call it the harvest home. Uh other people call it Shangrila. Right. Uh the Romans at Mount Olympus. That's where we'll be all be brought to the top of Mount Olympus. And uh some say, "Oh, it's the beautiful aisle of somewhere somewhere." They don't know where, but it's a beautiful aisle somewhere like that. Uh my goodness, the scripture says the ivory palaces, the the Jews call it Zion's Hill. Praise the Lord. And it's called Buler Land. Sweet bula land. Amen. But the prophet called it, there's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever. Can we sing that? &gt;&gt; And we'll only reach that shore by faith decreeing. One by one we gain the portals there to dwell with the immortals when they ring those golden [screaming] bells for you and me. [singing] Can't you hear the bells now ringing? [singing] Can't you hear the angels singing? There's a glory. Hallelujah. Jubilee [singing] &gt;&gt; in that far of sweet forever &gt;&gt; just beyond &gt;&gt; just in the next dimension &gt;&gt; when they reach golden [screaming] bells for you. The prophet said, "Do you realize it's passing through the room right now? &gt;&gt; I can look and I can see people and things passing right now. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Just beyond the shining river, &gt;&gt; a place we call &gt;&gt; the sweet forever. &gt;&gt; Let us anticipate heaven. But whatever men want to call it, the Bible said it's a place of perfect peace, unending bliss, [snorts] and unspeakable happiness, joy unspeakable. Paul said, full of glory. Amen. The scriptures tell us plainly, Jesus has gone to prepare a place for us. Amen. He's gone to prepare what? a future home for his earthly bride. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Just like some of you young men are prepare. You ain't got the the bride yet, but you you start preparing. Amen. You're saving. If you're not, then I'm telling you, you should start doing it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. you you you can't love on a hungry stomach, [laughter] right? So, you've got to be prepared. Praise the name of the Lord. That's why I admire brother Vishnu uh Hari Pasad. Um how before as a pastor, he would talk to me and say, you know, he's saving he he's going to buy this little condo, he's going to get this and going to do that. So when he he did that and when he was ready to marry already had a little condo and he had some put aside and time for him to marry, he's able to go marry and then take his wife to the little place later on sell it and then move on to something better. Praise God. But you don't just sit around and just uh hope some you know something happens. No, you've got to rest in God's grace and let God move you and bless you and use you for your honor and glory. For his honor and glory. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. But we know that it's so wonderful. It's so beautiful. Praise the Lord. You say, "My brother Sam, why you talk like that the other morning?" Whether dreaming, whether vision, whether asleep or awake, I don't know. But I saw some of those people young and fresh and healthy. I can't even explain it. Uh their eyes like stars, not bright and shining, but I mean the health in the eyes was so brilliant. Their teeth white and clean and gleaming while they're speaking. And my goodness, brother, sister, let me tell you, it's something else. when the brother Brandham said we are going to uh go right back to about 20 21 years old. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't sit here a and think oh my body is wasting away. I'm getting older. Yes. So that you can get out of this and get into that. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Death don't hold no terror for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're moving out of here and we're moving into that. Amen. &gt;&gt; This one is in time. That was the eternal. &gt;&gt; We going into the eternal. [screaming] Praise the name of the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. No wonder Brother Dig said, "Oh my goodness." On that rapture day, we'll have the greatest youth meeting the world has ever seen because of all [screaming] of us will be back to being young again by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. 1 Corinthians 2:9. For as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those that love him. Amen. You can't even imagine it or think about heaven. How beautiful it must be and marvelous. But we live in this joyous anticipation. One step and we'll be there by the grace of God. Listen, I'm not talking out of a debt wish. [laughter] Hey. Oh, is that brother Chris? Oh, praise the God. Bless your brother. I'm glad my amen corner is here. &gt;&gt; If none of you say amen, you're going to hear amen coming from the back. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. [clears throat] Amen. Titus 2:13 says, "Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our savior Jesus Christ." The great God and our savior. It's not two people, but the same God is your savior. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord, which is the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. How many of you wants to go to heaven? &gt;&gt; Praise. I want to I want to go to heaven. I know I'm on my way to heaven. But so many people want to go go to heaven. Nobody wants to die. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. This is just my way of relaxing and talking to you. Everybody wants to go to heaven, but when you talk about death, nobody wants to die, but you want to get to heaven. [laughter] No. No. It doesn't work that way. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Uh h and if you don't want to go to heaven, if not, why not? Why don't you want to go to heaven? I want to go. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Jesus said, Brother Brandham used to love to sing, "Come and go with me to my father's house. Let's go together." Amen. Praise God. And go to my father's house where there's peace and there is joy. Hallelujah. Praise God. [clears throat] You know, a mother and a father, both believers, lost their two children. And [clears throat] people thought that would keep them from going to the service on Sunday, but they were in service as usual on that Sunday, even though they had buried their children during the week. and he happened to be the song leader and she happened to be the pianist and they took their positions and she started playing on the piano and he announced the song Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee and while they were playing the people were crying but they were not they were solid in the grace of God hallelujah amen Amen. They were praising God and giving God the glory and honor. Amen. Had their compulsure. Uh, Amen. Until the congregation was saying, "How can these two people stand it? How can they stand it that their children pass away and they they're not in grief or anything like that." But well, the service ended and on the way home a little boy holding his father's hand, you know, and while they're walking and he says, "Well, seems like they really believe it." Uh, don't they? So the father said, "What are you talking about?" Uh, don't believe what? Who? What? Believe what, son? He said, "Well, them people some like they believe in Easter [laughter] and they believe in resurrection uh and uh like that." The father said, "Of course all Christians believe that." He said, "Not like them too do. Not like them." Amen. They believe all of it. Amen. They believe all of it. Nothing left out. Praise God. Hallelujah. My friends, death holds no terror for the bloodbought saints of God. &gt;&gt; Death is a doorway for us to enter into the grace of God. We're not worried about death. &gt;&gt; Death changes us. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you get to the place where you're not worried about that, about death, then you're free. &gt;&gt; You're free from this world and all it is, all its cares. Amen. Because eyes have not seen nor ears heard what God has in store for them that love him. Amen. Isn't it Jesus that said, "I am he that liveth and was dead." Of all other men in the Bible, it is written, "And Methuselah lived a thousand years, and he died. And Isaac lived 700 so many, and he died. And this one lived, and he died." But what we are reading about now, he said, "I was dead, [screaming] but now I'm alive forever more." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Alive forever more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Showing you the original wheat seed can come back to life. He's telling you your resurrection is right in me. Praise God. And if I can come back, you're coming back. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's bringing you back by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Talk about a rapture. Amen. We're right in it right now for the glory of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Brandham said, "Don't let the devil lie to you. If in your heart you're a real Christian, you are going to heaven. Just believe it like the rest of them believed it." &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going. How many believes they're going? I'm going. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Please don't tell me don't get excited. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, God builds everybody different. Some people can be excited and still remain calm and nice, but uh you know, I'm an extrovert. [laughter] I like people. I like to talk to people. So, so, so, uh that's the way it is. Praise God. Said, "But you're you're older man. You should watch your heart and how you behave before you overdo it." [laughter] Is that right? Oh my. But I've got to be myself. Praise God. I wish I could be like that old man that Brother Brandham said. He says, "When I seen that man, old man preached that word and jump." He says, "Almost right over the rainbow down to the other side and preach that word." Hallelujah. Oh, brother. Every one of us should be like like Joshua and Caleb. Amen. Having strength to even to the very end of your days. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Oh my. Let's have hope. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham often said, "Look and live, my brothers. Live. Look to Jesus now and live." &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. Now, we've seen how believers die, but you know that a lot of unbelievers die, but they don't make a lot of noise about it. I've seen them die. I've seen them hold my hand and scream while they're dying. Too late. Too late shall be the cry. Jesus of Nazareth has passed you by. Oh my God have mercy. Amen. And infidel was there on his deathbed. He says, "Oh God, deliver me from that awful pit." And cried with a awful whale. And then he went silent. And then all of a sudden, he screamed again, "I'm in the flames. Pull me [screaming] out. Pull me out. Pull me out of it." Amen. Praise God. But listen friends, it's written in the scriptures. Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And they shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal, and cast you the unprofitable servant unto outer darkness. There shall be weeping, wailing, and nashing of teeth. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Friends, let me tell you, a young steel worker over in England, [clears throat] you know, we have a steel company in Hamilton and somebody died there the other day. Um, and that happens from time to time, accidents. But in England, this young steel worker somehow he stumbled and fell on a red hot steel plate. I don't know if you know what I'm talking about, that when they poured the steel and it starts, it's not solid yet, but it's starting to get solid, but it's red hot. He fell on what? stumbled passing by onto a steel plate like that, hot uh like that upon him. And when he they rolled him off, all of his one side of his body was cooked and burnt to the bone. So some of the workmates that were there cried out uh uh uh uh you know, they cried out to him uh like that. that you see they were saying, "Oh my God, send for the doctor." Amen. But the the man cried, "I don't need no doctor." Amen. Tell me how I can get born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell me how I can get born again. And it just so happened nobody there was born again. They didn't know what to tell him. And he says, uh uh uh he died uh like that without God. Later on, somebody met one of those workers and says, "But you fellas, why didn't you tell him?" He you you you're supposed to be a churchgoer and a Christian. He says, "But I couldn't tell him because my life closed my lips." Wow. &gt;&gt; And many times the life that we live, close our lips. &gt;&gt; You you can't tell the person nothing because you know they're going to come back and say, "Come on, you do this. You did that. You Is that right? &gt;&gt; Close your lips." So, let's ask God to help us to live such lives where uh we can open our mouths freely and speak his word. comfort the people, draw them closer to him, bring them into a knowledge of him that the Holy Spirit might minister to them and bring them into this atmosphere of salvation. Amen. I have to ask the question, is your life closing your lips? Then right where you are, just whisper a prayer to God and say, "Lord Jesus, help me, Lord, that my life will be freed up and that I will be able to be free to speak and testify of the grace of the living God." Hallelujah. Amen. I hope you're not neglecting your soul salvation because the scripture says, "How shall we escape if we neglect?" so great a salvation. If you are here and you are not born again, don't neglect your salvation. Don't neglect your new birth. Let the Holy Spirit speak to your life and say, "I must make a change. This can't go on. May the great Holy Spirit break the power of sin and of the devil from over me and set me free that I might love him and serve him and worship him with my whole heart. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm preaching like this. I didn't know you were going to be here this morning. &gt;&gt; I didn't know anybody particular going to be here. uh uh you know of course before coming up all during the week I had all messages with all kinds of revelation and the Holy Spirit bring me to something this simple and I was trying to fight up and say no no no and move away no it brought me back keep bringing me back so I'm right here amen &gt;&gt; you can think or say whatever you want to say but I'm following his leadership &gt;&gt; amen praise the the name of the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Let me tell you friends, this gospel is real. &gt;&gt; This is gospel is real. &gt;&gt; A little a young lady laid dying on a bed. [clears throat] Little sister Hattie from a town called Buford. Um uh there's a sister and a brother. I used to go to their home in that same uh in that same town. Anyway, she laid dying there and as she was sinking into death, she said, "Uh, uh, mother, I forgot to say my prayers." And the mother says, "Oh, well, you can say your prayers." And she lay dying and she going to say her prayers. And you know the prayer now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. And she never said another word and went to be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has his own way. Another little girl lay dying. She said, "Oh, daddy, how sweet the sight. Uh, how sweet the sight that I am seeing now. The golden gates are open. The crowds of children are pouring out to greet me. Oh, crowds of them. They're running up to me and they're taking me in their arms and [screaming] calling me by my name. Oh my. Then she looked upward as she lay on the bed saying, "Yes, I'm coming, Lord. I'm coming. Amen." and she went to be with the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Friends, when he calls me, [screaming] I will answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll be somewhere listening for my name. Amen. I'll be listening for my name by the grace of God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Uh there's a little sister up there in Texas. A believer of years gone by testified that as her mother lay dying, the mother suddenly shouted and said, "I see the [screaming] angels. I'm seeing them now. They're all in the room." Oh my praise God. Can't you see them? Can't you see them? And then she went to be with God. You know, brother Brandham talk about brother Fed Bosworth when he laid there in the bed and and then all of a sudden he would jump up and say, "Oh, uncle." And he start talking to his uncle and he start talking to his father. He says he literally was seeing them in the room. Is that right? &gt;&gt; You know when Jesus uh uh uh in the just before everything there and the veil of the temple ripped, it says they started seeing the saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? In other words, they they were starting to seeing the saints while they're in their flesh. And I'm not surprised if some of you that are here and alive, praise God, because it says, "And we which are alive and remain, who do you think it's talking about? It's this last age. &gt;&gt; It's you and me that are alive and remain, &gt;&gt; will be caught up to have a be with the Lord." And during that period of time, uh, uh, uh, Maybe Abraham, Sarah, Job, you say, "Oh my, you that's going to happen." That will happen with some of us. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You don't believe it? I believe it. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. uh 1998 I for the first time I was invited to go to Nigeria by one of the kings there um who happened to be a brother and um uh I was wondering if I should go and um I like to read. So I was in the library and I was going up in the elevator and this dark skinned man with kind of curly hair came in and he stood up beside me and we're going up in the elevator. this is a big library. And he says, "Um, are you going to Nigeria?" You know, it's I I was so shocked I couldn't answer for for for a moment. And before I could even say anything, he says, "If I were you, I'd go to Nigeria." And before I could come to myself, the doors stop and he stepped out. And then then I thinking well how could he know I'm thinking about going to Nigeria and and come with that. Praise God. Of course when I I immediately went back to the floor, opened the door and looked around, searched the whole floor. No such a person there. Right? So I realized then that God still send angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. See, see, I've got to be careful because when you start talking like this, people begin to think you're talking about yourself and you want to make yourself look spiritual or something, they don't realize that the closer a man or woman comes to God and start to be get that oneness, they almost starting to talk almost in the first instant. They start I and my father are one. Let me just say it that way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. you start to actually come to that state where you I and my father are one. Brother Brenham said when Jesus was healing the sick when he was creating bread when he was a great preacher that was wonderful but he said when he came down to the end of his ministry and he started saying I and my father are one be before Abraham was I [screaming] am when he started talking like that he said that's what caused the trouble amen see Jesus's life you divided in three years of preparation. Amen. Years of popularity and a year of persecution and crucifixion and death. It It's that way. And that's way brother Brandham said every preacher has a first, second, and third pull. &gt;&gt; Everyone. And it goes the same way. First pull, second pull. He came to his third pull. And there it is. The the denominations all get away from him. They don't want to hear that because now he's not he he's preaching the word &gt;&gt; and the word is a separator. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. The word cuts to the bone. It's a discerner of your thoughts. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, how did that man know that? It's not the man. It's the Holy Ghost knows that. The Holy Spirit knows that. And he discerns [screaming] the heart by the word of God. Hallelujah. Word of God. Quick, sharp, sharper than a two-edged sword. dividing your spirit, dividing your your soul by the word of God. And that's what the word is doing right now while I'm preaching is discerning you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is discerning your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. Wonderful. Praise the Lord. I tell you, friends, how wonderful it is to be a child of God and to walk in his light. Amen. DL Moody said, "This is beautiful." He was dying on his dying deathbed. He said, "This is beautiful. This is beautiful. It feels like I'm in a trance, right? If this is death, it's sweet. There is no dark valley here." Amen. You know, people talk about the dark valley. Amen. Amen. He says, "Listen, there is no dark valley here. All I can hear is God calling my name. Amen. He's calling for me and I've got to go. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Let me tell you friends, I anticipate heaven. &gt;&gt; I look forward to it. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Here this young believer laid dying and his mother turned to him and said, "Son, is Jesus with you in that dark valley?" He said, "What dark [screaming] valley? It's not dark. It's bright and it's getting [screaming] brighter and brighter and brighter. Oh, mother, it's so bright now. I've got to shut my eyes." And he shut them and went to be with the Lord. Ah, friends, as in life, so in death, God's promises are sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, [screaming] &gt;&gt; but he shall have the light of life. John 8:12. &gt;&gt; Oh my, what of your future? What of your future? Amen. What I tell you, what lies ahead for you? What lies ahead for me? Praise God. Ask yourself that. Praise God. You don't deceive yourself. You know, Bible talks about being deceiving yourself or fooling yourself that you're okay. You don't need to listen to this preacher. You don't need to listen to your mother. You don't listen need to listen to your father. You just go on and live your life and have a happy wonderful time uh uh like that. Amen. But I tell you friends, the for the world, the future is bleak. The the the the future for this world is dark. &gt;&gt; It's bleak, my friends. Let me tell you friends, I can see the storm clouds of the oncoming storms [screaming] are gathering right now. &gt;&gt; And it's terrible for them. Amen. But for the Christian, it's bright. The sun is up. It's the rising of the sun. We're watching for the coming of that great day. Amen. That great hour, that great moment. And the power of the Holy Spirit is already preparing us for that going away. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; I love him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I love him. I love him because he first loved me. and per chest my salvation all cal three. Now [clears throat] there are three things we must live in anticipation um for in going to heaven and that we're going to see and experience. First, the scripture says, "Then we shall see the king in his great beauty, and we're going to be like him." &gt;&gt; Praise God. Listen, because we are in the flesh, you think you see Jesus, you can't see him clearly now because now we see through a glass darkly. But then you will see the king in his great beauty &gt;&gt; because then your eyes [screaming] will be completely clean and clear. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. Because your body is going to be changed &gt;&gt; and you're going into a new body. &gt;&gt; Don't let that sound mysterious. The body change. It's just a change of body. &gt;&gt; Is that right? No, don't the explanations of, you know, of the translation and the end morphing and all of that. I'm not talking about that. Somebody else will do that. But we're just talking the change of your body is being changed to a new body. &gt;&gt; Leaving a flesh body and entering into your theophony body &gt;&gt; which you bypassed. Amen. Being a part of the original log ghost. And when you came off from that as it illustrated on the day of Pentecost with pieces of flame going to each apostle um [clears throat] that we are going to meet that body. He says you see Jesus went he came with that. So that's why he could be the way he is but you are now going to that. Praise the name of the Lord. You're going to be changed from this to that by the grace of God. Isaiah says 33:17, "Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty." &gt;&gt; First Corinthians uh 13 12, for now we see through a glass darkly, but then we shall see face to face. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Praise God. Face to face will I behold him far beyond the starry sky. Face to face in all his beauty. I shall see him by and by. Praise God. 1 John 3:2 says, "Beloved, now are you the sons of God. It does not yet appear what you shall be." Praise God. Look at us now. It don't yet appear. In other words, it's not showing yet. This is what John is saying. You're alive and it's not showing as yet. Praise the Lord. my but when uh when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is praise God hallelujah everyone is going to be changed praise the name of the Lord then we won't have to worry is God a Chinese is God Jamaican is God German I can go down the list. But the the Jamaican could say God is a Jamaican. Because you remember he told Abraham uh Sarah, go and kill a kid, a goat kid. [laughter] So God has to be a Jamaican because he was eating a young goat. [laughter] Oh. Oh my. And next one says, "Oh, uh, no. God is God can't be Jamaican. God God is actually Chinese, &gt;&gt; right? Because you know, remember when uh I think it was uh Jacob there and he kind of the angel struck him on the thigh. He came back and he and you know Bible says his name was Limping. So God have a sense of humor. God must be Chinese. [laughter] You know, but God is not Chinese. He's not Jamaican. He's not German. He's not African. He's not Indian. Whatever. God is God. And he appeals to every race. All come out of him. He says he is the father of all nations. [screaming] come right out of him. Praise the name of the Lord. We give God praise. &gt;&gt; Let's praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, a certain boy was born blind. It's a terrible thing for us to be born blind. But if you think carefully, every one of us born blind. Born spiritually blind. Not physically, but you're born spiritually blind to the things of God and the supernatural events that takes place right in front of you sometimes and you don't even see it. You don't even recognize it. This man was boy was born blind and a surgeon operated successfully on his eyes. Praise God. I'm thinking of a brother that just had some surgery on his eyes and he's now recovering. And right now I pray that the Holy Spirit will go and touch him and bring him successfully through so that his vision will be clear and that he will be able to read and see clearly and fellowship fully once again for the glory of God. Do you believe that &gt;&gt; he's the same yesterday, today, and forever in the simplicity of the moment. God works his marvelous ways. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And so we see that um for weeks the boy's eyes were covered with bandages, covered over with bandages. And uh you know at the same as the time neared, they started taking off the bandages. And then one of the nurses asked him say, "Well, tomorrow we're going to have to take off the final bandage. And when we do remove it from your eyes, whom do you want to see first of all? Your mother, your dad, who do you want to see first of all? And the boy said without any hesitation. I want to first of all to see the doctor that gave me back my sight. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And I want to say the same thing. I want [screaming] to give praise to the doctor that gave me back my sight &gt;&gt; because spiritually I was blind but thank God now I can see the word. I can see the revelation that's in the word of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Don't tell me about this or that but let my keep my eyes on Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Job said, "I know that my redeemer liveth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he'll stand on the earth in the last days. Praise the name of the Lord. Praise God forever more. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. He's not because I tell you friends, what a time this. Forgive me if my mind is going this way and that way. I'm seeing a lot of things, but I just want to keep one line here. uh a choir was singing Handel's Messiah and singing some other songs and the the [clears throat] maestro stopped the the soprano that was singing. She was singing I know my redeemer liveth. I know my redeemer liveth and striking the right notes carrying it out perfectly like that. But the maestro stopped her and said, "Do you really know that your redeemer lives? &gt;&gt; Do you really know it?" Oh my God. He said, she said, "Yes, sir, I do." He said, "Then if you know it, sing it like you know it and tell me so that I too will begin to know it. &gt;&gt; That your [screaming] redeemer really lives." go back and sing again. Hallelujah. Oh my my my my. You see? And so she went back and began to sing it again. And it had them all spellbound. That my struck came to her at the end of that with tears in his eyes and said, "Now I know that you know and you have just told me so." Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? Let's not come up here just to entertain. &gt;&gt; Let's [screaming] not come and stand on this platform uh just to sing. &gt;&gt; We come to church to sing a few hymns. My friends, we ought to come and sing within our hearts and tears within our eyes &gt;&gt; because we are feeling what we are singing about. We're not just singing and singing a song of some imaginary something, but we are experiencing it in our lives. What he has done for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Many of you experience that sometimes you're reading brother Brandham and you hit a certain spot, you can't help it before you know it. The the front of your shirt or your blouse is wet because the tears are streaming down because of the love of God that is within your heart. Something strikes you. Amen. Warms your [screaming] heart because you know it's real. Praise God. All your doubts are settled and you know that it's real within your heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God forever more. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I tell you, let's preach it. &gt;&gt; Preachers, let's preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're praying, pray [screaming] it like you mean it within your heart. Amen. We're not some sick saply and sad ducklings hopping around not knowing what we're doing, but we are people that have been quickened by the Holy Spirit. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Anointed by the word and prepared for this moment. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Praise God. I think it's brother Brandham that spoke. If I can find a quote, but I don't like stopping to find quotes. It's there. Praise the Lord. He says a certain slave working on a plantation and somehow through the the church was going on and they were not just allowed to go into any church like that but you can hear the preaching while picking the cotton and he got converted and uh he told the master that he was converted and the master said that's wonderful. ful to know that you're converted. And because the master was a Christian, they they they still had the relationship of master slave, but they had a better relationship, right? And they were going on like that. And it just so happens, brother Brandham tells the story. He was about to die. And while he was there dying, uh, he says, um, an angel is calling me for my crown. He says, but I just told him, don't tell me about no crown. Don't tell me about a crown. All I want to do is to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is that right, &gt;&gt; my friends? In the book of Revelation, it says the 24 elders cast down their golden crowns before the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Cast down your ambitions. &gt;&gt; You can plaster the wall with diplomas. They're good for worldly existence, &gt;&gt; but cast them down in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I come to them all dung and ash in the presence of almighty God." Amen. Praise God. and let God receive all the praise, the honor and the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the God. Uh let the Holy Spirit speak to you beyond what I'm saying with voice and with words uh like that. Praise God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. He says, "My I'll see Jesus only." Oh my. Praise God. What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see. When I look upon his face, the one who saved me by his grace. When he takes me by the hand and leads me to the promised land, what a day, glorious day that will be. Yes, brothers, we will see our savior, but we will also see our loved ones again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; We'll see our loved ones again. &gt;&gt; That is why he says, don't you uh behave like the unbelievers do like you're never going to meet them again. We'll meet them again. &gt;&gt; We'll see them again by the grace of God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Praise God. Hallelujah. Let listen. I can't uh go through beyond the curtain of time, but I can just tell you about it. Praise God. Where this is the old booklet. Uh but anyway, when he talks about being caught up into heaven &gt;&gt; and when the crowds came out and began hugging him and our precious brother, our precious brother and began talking to him, he says, "And they were just human and I can feel them just as much as you are here right here today. Heaven is real. [screaming] &gt;&gt; It's not some religious fantasy somebody made up to get you to believe that." No, but it's [screaming] real. Praise God. &gt;&gt; My God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. I tell you friends, he's the same yesterday. And we shall see him for the Bible says the Lord himself shall descend with a shout. &gt;&gt; We're not going into the doctrinal or the theological part of that. Amen. But the Lord himself has descended with a shout. &gt;&gt; Voice of the archangel, the trump of God. Amen. Yes, sir. And some of the saints already have gone, but we who are alive and remain while you remain. Praise God. And the you'll be caught up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'll preach on that another time. You got to catch up before you can be caught up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because friends, it's telling you they're playing. You're going to be alive and you're going to start being caught up. While you're alive, you're going to be caught up. You're going to be alive and you're going to be changed. But you see, if you're going by feelings, you're going to feel nothing. Yeah. You're just going to be changed. It's all going to happen. Not just the end part of it where it says in the twinkling of an eye. But the change already started. By the time that hits, the whole thing is done. Total deliverance. &gt;&gt; You're delivered out of this. And you enter into that by the grace of God. Hallelujah. Praise God. We're gonna see them just like the prophets saw them. Amen. And not only we going to see them, we're going to know them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember Peter, James, and John saw Elijah and Moses &gt;&gt; and they knew them. &gt;&gt; But they never met them. &gt;&gt; They never met them. But the moment they saw them with Jesus, they knew who they were. We are going to know [screaming] as we are known. &gt;&gt; We will recognize them because they are part of the same word. &gt;&gt; So they're going to know you and you're going to know them because we all one in the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Praise God. Now a certain Christian doctor died and his wife of course loved him very very much and you know she being a believer and knowing that she would meet uh with him her loved one again she took the old wooden sign that he would have right outside of his door of his office, his business that he had there, and she put it in the living room so that she could look at it every day and remember him. And the sign said, "Doctor gone out, be back soon." Is that right? And that's exactly what it is with us &gt;&gt; as Christians and believers because when we come riding with Jesus back, him and his bride rides back down. Amen. Uh the white horse rider riding back, we come back to earth again with him. Praise the name of the Lord. Yes, friends, that's the way it is. All debt is to a Christian is they're gone out, but they're back soon by the grace of God. Hallelujah. I absolutely believe it. Amen. Praise God. Now uh it just so happens that the scripture says blessed uh the song says blessed hope that in Jesus is given in our sorrow and joy to sustain that soon our with our savior in heaven we shall meet with our loved ones again. Blessed hope, blessed hope, blessed hope, we shall meet with our loved ones again. Blessed hope in the word God has spoken, all our peace by that word we obtain. And as sure as God's word was never broken, we shall meet with our loved ones again. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter how long they're gone, we're going to meet them again. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. So don't be like those who have no hope and grieving for the rest of your life, &gt;&gt; like you'll never ever see them again. We'll meet them again &gt;&gt; by God's grace. For the hour is coming, and now is, which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth and have that have done good that have done good into the resurrection of life. Amen. We're coming into the resurrection of life. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We are partaking of it now. Resurrection of life now. But the actual literal if you pass then you will partake of it then. Now another doctor died. His office used to be above a storefront. You know what's a storefront &gt;&gt; and sometimes they have offices above and so he had a sign that was downstairs to point the people that his office was upstairs. So, um, they took the sign that he had downstairs and put it on his headstone. And the headstone read, "Doctor's office now upstairs." &gt;&gt; Friends, God's word will never be broken. &gt;&gt; You may be gone from this world. They can't see you anymore. Paul said, "We are encompassed with a crowd of witnesses." What's he talking about? They're gone before. They can see us, but we can't see them. Praise God. Hallelujah. But we are encompassed with them by the grace of God. Hallelujah. When he calls his sheep, he said they will answer because I call them by their names. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. Blessed uh he'll call all the blessed dead by name and all that trusted in him. Praise God. And I believe God is calling his last sheep now. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; The hour is late and he's calling his last sheep now. Let's give heed to the word of God, to the voice of God, and answer the shepherd's call. Amen. Our great shepherd King is with us. the Holy Spirit and he's calling his children back to attention of his word. Are you ready to meet him? &gt;&gt; Even if you're a believer, I'm asking a question. &gt;&gt; If you're unbeliever, a makeeliever, a churchgoer, are you ready to meet him? Are you really ready? You know, you say, "Yes, yeah, yeah, I'm ready." Yeah, but sometimes that's just uh fluff and fraught on a beer. Then you just move away like that. But when it comes from inside your heart, I'm ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to meet him in life. I'm ready to meet him in death. Praise God. I hope my friends when he calls that you will be somewhere listening for your name. Amen. Because we can anticipate rest from our labors. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's perfect rest beyond the river. Hallelujah. Oh my. After God finished his work in Genesis, he rested. After we finish our work, we're going to rest. We have already entered the believer's rest with the opening of the word taking away our doubts and affairs. The supernatural Sabbath has started within our hearts. But we going to be entering into a complete atmosphere of total rest, sinlessness. There is no temptation. No devil there. So there's no temptation. There's no nothing. You are free in the presence of God. You've entered into the final rest of God's people. Amen. Because you fulfill God's purpose while you're here on earth. Amen. What it is, fulfill his purpose, whatever that is. Praise God. So, there's going to be rest beyond the river. &gt;&gt; Rest for your for your body. Amen. Rest from work. Don't start resting now if you're still young. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you get older, you can start talk about rest, but you're young, but you've got to work. But rest beyond the river, physical work. Your body is going to go through pain. So, you're going to want rest beyond the river. Tiredness. Sometimes you drag yourself home. You're so tired. Some of us, thank God, if you have one job and it's well paid and fine, you can try to make out other people. two jobs, some three jobs. They can hardly rest. They just got to work, work, work, work. Working all the time, day and night. Hardly any sleep whatsoever. My God. Weary in their body. Amen. And then also sometimes they in secret. They won't tell nobody. The tears come down. What am I going to do? How am I going to take care of this? How am I going to take care of these children? How am I going to take care of my home? Their body, physical body being worn out, tormented, troubled, tried and tested. Other people are looking forward to rest. Rested in their mind because their minds were constantly worried. worried. What am I going to wear? How am I going to pay my rent? How am I going to look after my car? How this? And then you may have some families phoning you and asking you to help for help. Uh and you can hardly help yourself, but they're asking you for help. And so therefore, you find yourself in that situation. Maybe you are not in it, but somebody else may be in it in that kind of a situation like that. And a life full of troubles. Oh my I I I once was in a state like that where it's like Job's messengers following you. You get one trouble and you think it's come to an end. Another trouble, another trouble, another trouble. It's like you have a whole life full of troubles coming after you one after the other. It's the devil testing you. It's the devil trying you like he tried Job also. Amen. And then he's nervousness and nervous breakdowns and all that stuff like that on your mind. And then uh your soul, the devil going to attack that too as a Christian with lies, with lust, with all kinds of problems. He come to you with sin. Amen. Hallelujah. Uh my friends, maybe you didn't have it easy in life. I didn't have it easy in life either. Amen. You face troubles. You face trials. You face trespasses. You face tribulations all within your life. You face uh a broken heart. Amen. I know you're not going to say amen to give yourself away [panting] because that's an inside thing. So we we get but we do have broken hearts. Amen. uh heartaches and sometimes uh used and abused uh misused uh like that. But remember after all this is over there'll be rest beyond the river. &gt;&gt; And now talk to a few ministers whether here or in the land of the internet. Maybe you live for the gospel. It could be a believer. Maybe you labored for the gospel your lifetime with no notoriety, no notice, nobody ever realizing how much you sold out your life as a prisoner to Christ &gt;&gt; and had rough times. Paul had rough times, too. I seen the prison in Rome that they held him in. Dark and damp. Oh my. And rough stone like in that he had scars in his body from stoning claw marks. He says from the beasts at Ephesus. Body weary having only one cloak. You stop and think the life of some of these prophets. You realize that Elijah only had one suit. All well and good. It was a camel hair suit. [laughter] But it was one suit. Can you imagine how he smelt and then he has to go and talk to those people? They they don't want to hear him because people look at those things, how you appear and how you look rather than what you're saying. And they they make comments about this or that. Your socks, your tie, your whatever. And the devil use anything to distract you from the word instead of listening to a voice that's coming forth that you can receive something for your soul. Amen. But Paul went through all that. But he was anticipating heaven so much that he said, "But I am still persuaded that he is able [screaming] to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just give me a little more time. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Praise. If you want to sleep, sleep right where you are. Just my voice is still going to come through to you. Not from the sound of it, but it's going to come through to you. Amen. Yes, sir. Praise God. He was finding rest. Praise God. Maybe some of you have lived your life raising your family and you lived a rough life, passed through some really rough times raising your family, giving your life's blood. Literally sometimes giving your life's blood. Coming home from work with your hands bruised and bloody. Amen. Oh my work, laboring day after day after day, going out early in the morning, snow flying all around the place, dark and you have to leave and go out to work, come back home late in the night, and the cycle continues. just get a little bit of rest back out to work and on and on like that. Amen. But let me tell you, God sees it and he knows all about it. &gt;&gt; And one day, he's going to repay you and there's going to be rest beyond the river. One time, Dr. George Truit met a believing uh widow that was working to earn her living. husband died. She had her children and hands rough and gnarled. And he said to her, "Sister, what does heaven mean to you?" She says, "Pastor, heaven means to me, rest. I can rest now from those labors." Oh my. I tell you friends, you may have spent your life bearing other people's burdens. I I'm talking like this because it becomes emotional. I know my parents, they weren't members of any church, but they read their Bibles. They prayed. They taught us to read the Bible, memorize the Bible, and to pray. But yet they will cook, bake, and take breads, cakes, food to the people that were needy up the street, down the street, across the town. They'll find out and they'll just keep doing that all the time. But what do you get from that? Nothing. They didn't care. They just did it by the grace of God. And so uh you may uh spend your life bearing other people's burden and bearing other people's heartaches. You might be the kind of person that people will come to and sometimes tell their troublesh if you can solve their problem. But really it's not that they seeing something in you and that's why they came to you. Praise the name of the Lord. Don't worry about your physical body getting weary now while I'm talking. Right? is you know that that's human but let the Holy Spirit speak with your soul uh and and give you what you need. You may never hear this again like this. So receive it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Sometime God wants us to bear the infirmities of the weak. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Now u all these things you know uh they took care of people until the day they died like numberless people I can think of that come offering them their property I'll sign the deed the the children are not around the children don't want nothing to do with them they said no we are not doing it for that we're doing it for Jesus sake we're doing it for the Lord's sake amen praise God well people thought They were foolish. But in my eyes, they were not foolish. They were children of the living God. And they believed it with all their hearts. Praise the name of the Lord. Praise God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Praise God. Listen what the scripture says in the great book of Revelation. Hallelujah. Now it says here in the book of Revelation, "And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, blessed are the dead which die in the Lord. Yay, sayeth the spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them." Let me tell you, any little thing you do for the Lord, men may forget, but God won't forget. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your works will follow you. Good or bad, your works is going to follow you. And he will he will reward you for everything that you do for his glory. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Now, I think I'm going to wind this up here. I'm not finished, but I'll wind it up here because I can feel your spirits getting weak and weary and tired. And we all want to get out of here, don't we? Nobody wants to answer. Everybody wants to go to heaven. Nobody wants to die. Everybody wants to have lunch, but nobody want to admit it. [laughter] Amen. Well, every speaker needs to know that is, you know, you you can you feel the sense uh the people and where they're at and when it's time for you to stop, you need to stop, right? And you take it from there. But what I I want to close with this thought, you need to anticipate heaven. Some people don't want to anticipate it because to leave here and go there is judgment. others to leave here and go there. It's the blessing of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are anxious. It doesn't bother us. But if you are here and you have any doubt, may the Holy Spirit speak to you. &gt;&gt; Get born again. Get baptized in water &gt;&gt; the right way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Come to him now while there is yet time to come. While the train is coming in the station, get ready to get on board. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let the Holy Spirit take you all the way through. &gt;&gt; This train is bound for glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe I'm part of the train. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads in prayer. Praise the name of the Lord. Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you for these wonderful people in front of you. And Lord, I pray you'll bless them everyone. Some of them are here today with some trouble and trial in their life, some need to be met. I simply ask, Father, in the name of Jesus, that their needs will be met for your glory and for your honor. Hallelujah. And Lord Jesus, I pray for those who are sick in their body that Lord, if they can believe it, if they can see themselves moving freely and briskly and healthily and joyfully in the spirit of Christ, then Lord, set them free. Oh God, I pray you'll heal the sick among us. You'll touch the mind of those who may be disturbed in the name of Jesus Christ. And Lord, those of us who feel guilty and ashamed, lift our shame, lift our guilt, give us peace, give us perfect rest, Father in thee, for I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Do you know the song? This world is not my home. It's not my [singing] home. &gt;&gt; Somewhere beyond the blue angels step on me. Heaven is open door and [music] I can't [singing] be let go in this world. [music] Oh Lord, your Lord [singing] I have no friend [music] like you and heaven not my Lord what would I do the angels [music] on me from heaven and [music] my [music and singing] all accept &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I fixed it up with Jesus [music] years ago and finish [music] my glory. [music] Amen. Oh Lord, the Lord I [music] have broken my Lord. What will I do? [music] Angel [singing] [music] [music] will live eternally [singing] on every shout [music] victory. [singing] A song of sweet and praise [music] back from heaven and I can't [music] feel anymore. Oh Lord, [music and singing] I have no friend like you. Heaven [music] my home what I do. The angels [music] back on me from heaven open and I can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The holy hills of heaven call me. Please be seated. to mansions fair across the sea where loved ones wait and crowns are given [singing] and the hills of home they're calling me. A country where no twilight shadows deepen. Unending day where night shall never be. A country where no storm clouds can gather. And this is just what heaven means to me. This house of clay is but a prison. Bars of bone, they hold my soul.
