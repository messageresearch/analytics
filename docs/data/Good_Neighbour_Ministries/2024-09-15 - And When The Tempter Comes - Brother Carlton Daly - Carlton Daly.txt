all the way from Jamaica New York God bless you brother have the Liberty amen good morning God bless you and it's my privilege to greet you all in the precious and lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I am honored this morning to have this uh precious opportunity uh speaking to your former Pastor brother John Simon who I've known for many years even though we were not so much uh personally connected but we have you know been in touch for quite some time and uh the last time I met him in person with was in Israel in uh November December 19 uh sorry 2022 and there is where he told me you know his intention of um you know handing over the pastorship to your current Pastor uh brother Dany and uh once again like I said it's a privilege to be here amen I bring you greetings from uh preach the Gospel Tabernacle our home Church in New York and um I am not a New Yorker that's not born born in the United States even though I'm a citizen but I'm from the very home country that your former Pastor is from from Guyana South America so this is why the connection is there I visited Canada on many occasions because most of my biological relatives lives in Canada I'm the only one in New York flying the New York flag and uh whenever I come to visit I would normally visit you know message church but I've been doing that mostly at um uh perfect love Tabernacle uh Pastor Louis nison I don't know if you know him uh that's where I would normally visit whenever I come but this time I said Lord you know I did uh promise brother Simon that I would try my best to you know to come and to have Fellowship I've seen most of you already on stream so people are watching you amen and uh I'm privileged Amen to be standing here uh to minister to not you know you the church members but the to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen because I believe there's just one bride amen uh regardless we may have different location of Fellowship but what really unites us is the spirit so I trust that the holy spirit will have his way this morning and he will use me in whatever way he would love to to be a blessing uh to the kingdom of God Amen so uh may we bow our heads amen praise God before we get to the word hallelujah Heavenly Father Lord this is indeed a great privilege like David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and father we are blessed to be here because not only to see our fellow brothers and sisters but Lord to know that you are here this appointment Lord was pre-planned oh God even before the foundation of the world and now today Lord it is being made manifest that you know that I would be here my wife would be here the sister would be here and all these wonderful Saints of like Precious Faith would be here but most important to know that you are here father and Lord we come to worship we come to lift up your name Lord we come because Lord we need more of you father and so Lord in this hour that we live our hour of great challenge but Lord you have given us what it takes to overcome the revealed word for this our day Lord we thank you Father for Brother John Simon Lord his labor of love we thank you Lord for Pastor Danny Lord God who have taken over lord the the rle as Pastor father may you continue oh God to use and to bless them and all the helpers oh God even the congregation as they come to support for this is all not for the glory of man but for the glory and praise of your matchless name so Lord have your way Lord now and come take full control help me Lord God by using me father let the Holy Spirit father take from control we ask this in Jesus Christ's precious name amen and amen I don't know if we can just sing a little song uh before thank you amen I enter the holy of holies I don't know if you know that one oh she doesn't okay all right uh in his presence there is fullness of joy you know that one yeah we can sing that one fine [Music] Amen in the [Music] presence of [Music] jeh God almightyy Prince of be TR vanish heart of mened in the pray [Applause] of the king Hallelujah God bless you Saints amen as you stand let us turn to the word of God we'll be reading from The Book of Matthew chapters 4 1 to1 and then Matthew 3 13-1 17 and 1 Peter 5 8-10 then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hunger and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up least at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone I just want you to recognize the devil knows the word oh yeah he comes to church amen sometimes we we make it so like it's too hard but I believe he's in every service because he knows the word Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them he even saw Canada yes even though it didn't exist back then amen and said unto him all these things will I give thee if thou wil Fall Down and Worship me then said Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve then the devil let him and leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him I want you to know that even in your weakness angels are there to minister to youall you're never alone because of who you are amen okay Matthew 3 from verses 13 then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forsake Him saying forbid him sorry saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me so you see the word has to come to the word and John answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and John when he was baptized went up straight away out of the water and lo the heavens were open upon him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lower voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and then one other scripture first Peter chapters 5 8 to 10 be sober be vigilant now that is for us okay because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walk about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who had called us onto his eternal Glory not time there's no timeing this amen by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you now may the Lord God add us blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats and I would like to for a little uh title to entitle this and when the tempter comes amen and when the tempter comes and for a context the Builder's reputation amen the Builder reputation now saints of God we all desire to live a comfortable life we desire to have one what this world has to offer in terms of modern day uh technology uh you know it's wealth and all that we can dream of because like in America they say you have the you know the American dream and that is you know to own a house you know and to have whatever luxury that we can have now nothing is wrong with those things saints of God but as sons of God I'm not addressing you you as just Canadian Believers but as sons of God Amen and I'm certain many of you are from other nations as well as I am from Guyana South America but we have to know not only who we are but who God is because you cannot know who you are until you first know brother Bram says who God is and when you get to know by Revelation who God is then he will reveal to you who you are it's not what you think you want to be but it's what he has in his mind concerning you and me and that's what really matters it's not our ambition it's not what we want to be but is what he had predestinated so in other words it has nothing to do with us amen so whatever would be our the end of our faith the end of that we labor and we work for God already knows it he is already pre-planned amen praise God what we will be Hallelujah and you know bream says when this bride gets to know who she is see this is what really matters since then he said the Rapture will go hallelujah amen but this subject this morning and when the tempter comes is something that we have to be we cannot bypass a church if you're a son you must go through that experience your enemy is not who you see sitting beside you or around you it's not the government it's not some race of people but you're enemy as ran says the greatest enemy is yourself when you don't know who you are amen church because if you know who you are whenever the enemy comes you will know how to uh what should I say uh to overcome him amen and the only way you can overcome him is not by your strength it's not by your knowledge but by the word that's the only way we can overcome in and what is the word amen it is not letters because Paul says the letter kill it but the spirit give it life so what is important we must we must have that holy spirit because we can read this Bible intellectually it is not a book of intellectual because Christ said I thank the father that he hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and reveal it to babe so in other words we have have to Humble ourself to be child trained regardless you might be in your 70s or your 60s amen you may have been in this message a long long time that means nothing Saints but until you can become like a child to be child train then you are meat for the master service so it's to know how to humble yourself that's what really matters amen and even to humble yourself is one of the hardest thing to do because we have what you call a free moral agency amen we have you know uh what you call a self-esteem who are you to talk to me like that now Christ could have said the same thing who are you to talk to me like that but all he did was not use his power amen he never used Miracles but he used it is written hallelujah hallelujah it is written because in the beginning was the word not Miracles even though we believe in miracles because you can't have Miracles by bypassing the word you must have the word first for the Miracles to follow but there are people who want Miracles but they don't want the word amen so you can receive Miracles you can you know be healed and still be lost you can receive the anointing of the Holy Ghost thank God for this message can still be lost you said but brother de I can't understand that I thought when I get the Holy Ghost that's it you see but you can have the Holy Ghost Amen on your flesh yes you can have it you know uh what should I say in your mind but unless it gets into that Soul amen the Bible says it's not the body that sinth but it's the soul that sinth it shall die Hallelujah so how do you receive the word in the first place you cannot just say you'll take the tape and you will listen to the tape with all due respect amen but Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing the word of God and how can you hear except God sends he said I will give you pastors not one but plural I will give you pastors according to my own heart so it's not you trying to qualify yourself or brother they trying to qualify himself that I'm around for a long time and you know it's time for the pastor to give me this position but unless God gives you Hallelujah you're not a gift to the people it's just your ego it is just your knowledge and we saw Paul before he was converted had such knowledge he thought he was doing God a service but without Revelation but but when because God had chosen him hallelujah amen it's not Paul choosing you could have never choosen yourself to believe this message the only way you can be where you are this morning is because God choose you we never choose ourself this is why when the tempter comes except God chooses you you're no match for [Applause] him Jesus didn't choose to come but he was tent of the father but he's not another person it is just that God who is a spirit because God is not a man he's a spirit but that Spirit has to take on bodily form amen so this is why he chose and he you know he stepped out amen from this uh logos from this great you know Spirit to become visible so that you can see him and know that he's not just a Son of God but he is God because he told the devil worship God but you think he was saying another person but the devil didn't have Revelation who was in him so to be a Son of God this morning you're not just a church member you are God in flesh it's not God now only in Jesus that's right amen because Jesus without the Christ is is just a Jesus like the Jesus there are many people that have the name Jesus but are they the Christ and the devil know that there's going to be a Christ he know there's going to be a Seed of Abraham he know there's going to be a woman's seed so he was hunting for that seed Hallelujah from since the garden he was hunting for it but Adam failed amen uh Noah failed because he drank After the flood and he died Moses failed all the prophets but when it came to this one that came to John in the water John said I'm not worthy for you to come to me but he said suffer it so John Hallelujah so he's giving the example and how we should be identified because you can't just come to church and sit there and say you believe the message because you have to follow God's Pro PR you must be baptized amen you must be filled with the spirit Hallelujah so he came now what baptism signifies death burial and Resurrection Hallelujah because without the resurrection our faith is dead amen so when you are baptized it means you're dying you are buried but then the victory is you'll rise again so we must know him in the power of his resurrection now if you have a very close loving relative of yours and death strikes that family it's it's hard even though you're a message believer that is no ordinary experienceing I've lost both my father and mother you know they are there in the grave now they were not message Believers but you know what I thank God for that God used them as the channel to bring me into this world and on the basis of knowing that God had used them I have a hope that even though they may not know or understand about this message saints of God but they have brought a Son of God hallelujah thank J into this world and thank God for this message BR said I now know that I am more than Ella bradam or you know Charles Bram son but I am a Son of God so what that means Church you have no beginning Jesus and you can have no end but this Mortal will perish but before it does God already has a plan that he already has a body that if only he can allow us to see beyond this natural and see what we are in the spiritual Hallelujah there's nothing look even though you don't have a job you still Rejoice because just having that revelation of who you are as Son of God that when the enemy comes to say you have cancer you have stage four you know you're going to die look him in the face and say yes I don't mind but this you're speaking to this but you're not speaking to that what is inside of me because the real me is not what you're seeing on the outside the real me is what is on the inside and I know that one can't die Hallelujah now look we would say in this life the best time of our life is when probably you were working in a company and you got promoted from a supervisor now to a manager or probably the CEO and you know what benefits goes with that all right I I've the experience you don't pay for your gas when you go to the gas station the company pays for it you don't pay for your electricity for your home the company pays for it all you have to do is submit the bills and all the bills are paid you think you want to give that up to accept you know something where you it has to come out of your pocket amen I don't knowah you say I work hard for it amen and now I've achieved so it's the best time of my life but that's for Mortal but when it comes to a Son of God the best time of your life is when the test comes amen now I know we would get much amen there thank you Jesus who pray and ask God give me a test who pray and ask God give me stage four cancer you're you got to be a mad man who pray and ask God well let my wife give me some trouble or let my wife husband give me some trouble nobody prays like that but God will allow it and the reason why he will allow it is to prove to the devil who you are hall because you're not just a Mr and Mrs daily son but you're a Son of God and as long as you're a Son of God his eyes are upon you all the days of your life now I would just like to give you a little example here of what it is to be chosen and the material that you're made up of this morning amen we all know brother Bram isn't that so yes sir we all know the test he went through don't we all right we see how you know we read uh his life story and we can always talk about brother Brown's life story but you can talk about all of that still church and still be lost God is not taking you into the Rapture because you know about William Brandon you have to come to know who you are this bridge is not between you know life and Eternity is not a one man's Bridge it's not M William branham's bridge but God had built a bridge and you know Bram told of it wasn't a story it's a a real life situation we're in Australia there was this challenge to build a bridge in the harbor you know from I can't remember if it was Sydney what have you but the government had put out uh tender for engineers who are qualified enough to build this bridge across the harbor and there are some who put in the tender they came and they started to do their you know survey and test and you know they dug and very deep but then they come to realize that the depth is too deep and even though they put the steel piles or what have you it would not hold so many of them tried their best but it couldn't work so it seems as though nobody could take that challenge until one day there was an English engineer a young man that came and said I can do the job so everybody looked at him and think well who are you and what he did first of all he made sure that when they dog deep they went all the way to bedrock you have to hit Bedrock cuz until you find Bedrock if you're just hitting sand you're just hitting mud it cannot stand so you have to go deep so Saints I want you to know this morning we have to go deep you can't just sit in church and just you know a quick sermon and we go home we have to go deep until we come to bedrock and you know Bedrock is Christ am on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand so make sure you find Bedrock so when he found Bedrock he said okay I know I can build this bridge but that was not all it's not how deep you go you have to find the material so to set up now your columns and your piles and your Steel Etc but he does just go and buy any steel now when we look at steel because we don't have the knowledge of what is the quality of Steel always said that's a good piece of Steel let me buy it but he didn't do that he know that that steel had to be tried tested proven not only for the depth but for uh nature you know the the challenges of nature okay over a period of time where if it would rust and you know it will collapse eventually so he had to have a steel made of the best material so for God to build this bridge Between Heaven and Earth he has to look around Toronto he has to look around Burlington and I'm certain there are hundreds of thousands of people here but why you why choose you from Burlington why choose you from Toronto why are you so special there are other people that do great things but why you now you didn't know that but God know what you made up of he know the quality of the material that our faith is made up of so he's going to choose not only the best but the best of the best so the bride this morning is no ordinary people they are the best of the best nobody may have told you so but he is telling you this morning you're not here by chance but I have chosen you and the reason why I'm chosen you because I'm building a bridge and in this bridge you're a part of that bridge Hallelujah so he will have to get the best steel and not only steel he has to get now the concrete or what you call it the mixture of Sand and Stone and uh the cement also have to be of the best quality because again it has to withstand the weather it has to withstand the salt it has to withstand the wind amen so he has to have the best material Hallelujah so this is why when the tempter comes it's God proving you that Under Pressure you will not give up under pressure you w't leave the church under pressure even the pastor preached something that you didn't like but God knows it's the best for you because he's proving you are not believing and following this message because of your pastor because of brother Bram or because of brother Bramson but you are following because you are chosen you are an elect it had nothing to do with you Saints so you had to search the whole world at this end time to find the best of all the church ages now all the other Church ages came to an end Hallelujah they all died you cannot go back to Wesley you can't go back to Luther you cannot even go back to Pentecost Hallelujah now you say but brother hold up hold up are you against Pentecost no church I believe in Pentecost but we have to have more than Pentecost let me give you a simple example thank you Jesus in Matthew sorry in the Old Testament we know that life begins with a birth all the way back in Eden but the first birth in Eden was not by the spoken word it was by sensation Eve was deceived by the serpent it brought sensation it felt good it tasted good and she went to her husband with that sensation now don't you think Adam knew what happened he know he is the word Hallelujah he's not just a man but he's a word because a Son of God means you are part of the word and brother says one word slightly doubted one word broken brings the fall this is why we are all old aged this morning we can't stop it this is why we have cancer every trouble we have in the land right now is all because of what took place with that first birth and that first birth was not by the spoken word but it was by sensation but it started with a false preacher sir sir amen hallelujah so this is where your Trouble Comes is if your the preacher is not a man of God chosen of God sent of God a man according to his own heart then the church is in trouble amen so he started off preaching didn't God say she said yeah he did but didn't he tell you that this thing has sensation said but you know uh that part I'm not too certain about so he said I want you to know it is good it tastes good and when you do it then your eyes will be open Church what opens our eyes is it sensation or is it revelation amen so just to make it short she fell for it sensation and it brought conception right come on and that conception God already knew what would take place Hallelujah and he already had preparation yes for what had happened then thank God for his full knowledge thank God for predestination am thank God for election Church Hallelujah but nevertheless he allowed it because for his elect there's a way out and the only way out is by God himself becoming one of us amen hallelujah not the spirit but God had the spirit had to become flesh so that first birth was by by sensation and Adam followed that move that he too went with sensation now he knew as God told him the day you touch that tree the day you die was it a physical tree but said no she was that tree because a tree of life amen life comes either by a woman or by the new birth Hallelujah we were all born out of that old carnal nature this is why we suffer this is why we die but when Jesus came he said you must be born again Hallelujah hallu but not by sensation even though it can bring sensation but not sensation so much just in the flesh but the Revelation the wine of stimulation Hallelujah will make you scream will make you jump but it's not so much a fleshly thing church it's a Revelation so from Eve in the garden all the way all the prophets were born by sensation and then when we come to the New Testament there were two women Elizabeth zachariah's wife she was of age she was Barren and God sent an angel to Zachariah and said you and Elizabeth will have a son like me an old man so there was a body change and Zachariah and Elizabeth by sensation brought by conception John the Baptist Hallelujah by sensation but was John the Baptist the Christ was William Bram the Christ no when they came to him they said are you the Christ and many even in the message will want to make brother Bram Christ now that is an antichrist Spirit Hallelujah I don't care how much the the God use the prophet but he's not God he was born like any one of us he was born to even tell lies like any one of us hallelujah you don't think God know all our mistakes he know the lies we would have made but by for knowledge by predestination he saw us perfect Hallelujah so how will he bring that Perfection it had to come by more than a John it has to come by more than a William brandham it has to come by the Holy Ghost himself Hallelujah so Elizabeth had the same Angel Gabriel that came to Zachariah that brought her John the Baptist but by sensation not the word sensation I mean they were given a promise Hallelujah and they believed the promise but Mary 800 years prior Isaiah the prophet says a virgin shall conceive how can you fathom that how can a virgin conceive without sensation how could you the virgin of Christ conceive without sensation but the word was already spoken a virgin shall conceive and nobody's going to stop that not even God could stop that because there's a time appointed that we the Virgin bride of Christ must become pregnated but pregnated by the spoken word hallelujah so Mary a virgin going to the well and here come Gabriel Hail Mary thou are found highly favored among women and you know the Roman Catholics take that and they tried to make her the mother of God what nonsense Hallelujah but she's a virgin and all the Angels said to her you're going to have a child and his name Shall be Called Jesus but she said I know no man he said I know that Church Bear in mind don't we know brother brandham you think this message is of a man no did Brother brandham know you cuz if he did you can't bring the Christ child because this message is not by a man this message is by the holy spirit it's not a man's thing this is why we will both our church is better than any other church we have the best message preacher in Canada we have the best message preacher in New York we have the best message preacher in Trinidad or South Africa man but this Christ child is not going to come by a man she said I know no man how am I going to have this child he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee no man shall overshadow thee because if he was a man we will lift up a man and this is why if you don't get this birth right we are going to lift up brother Brandon before the people and it's going to confuse the people we don't know if this message is right but if you're a Mary it cannot be wrong church because you know you didn't receive it by a man but you receive it by Revelation the Holy Ghost shall overshadow youus [Applause] now in the garden Eve had to know Adam and she knew the serpent she had a relationship with boat and she produced conception by boat but look what it brought Church death yes fighting murder see that's why anytime you're born of a man you'll be a murderer you're born of a man you'll leave church you're born of a man when The Temper comes you don't know how to overcome Jesus never said Joseph is my father neither do he ever say Mary is my mother but he know where he come from he said I come from God and I'm going back to God every son and daughter we are not from Trinidad we are not from Canada we are not from New York but we come from God Hallelujah the same holy ghost that was in Jesus is the same holy ghost in every son and daughter of God hallelujah and when you come to know that like brother Braham says I now know I'm not the son of Ella and Charles Branham which Pentecostal Church could preach that I'm not against Pentecostal church I believe they had their day but church we are further up the road hallelujah hallu hallelujah you know look I'm not trying to be political but right now in the United States is political season and one of the candidates is saying we are not going back she's right but that is just politics but this bride we are not going back but we are going ahead we are going on to the Statue of a perfect man we are going on to Perfection Church Hallelujah the Pentecostals had yes their time they taught that speaking in tongues falling down was really it no I'm not against it I believe it is but we will not all speak in tongues we will not all interpret we were not all you know the the gifts but the best of it is when we could just have the revelation of who Jesus is amen of righteousness is not what you can do your righteousness is not your experience but your righteousness is your Revelation that Jesus Christ is our righteousness he has already done all that we need Hallelujah to make us a son and daughter of God hallelujah so our righteousness is him the devil came to him if thou be if Hallelujah and it's the same thing those who are looking at our life if thou be but you must know in your heart I am not if thou be thank you Pastor but I am who I am not because of what I made myself but because of revelation God has opened to me amen these mysteries of where I come from my ancestor is not Africa or Ireland or Europe that's what politicians fight for that's what you know this body of us the way we look at it fight for but that spirit that is in us that spirit that Mary recognized that the Holy Ghost shall overshadow the she didn't ask any other question all she said is be it unto me be it unto me no question why because God chose her amen God elected her don't you think there were many other virgins in Mary's time but why Mary God doesn't make mistakes Church don't you think there are many good people like you in the world right now in Burlington wherever you live but why you is it because your pastor called you he couldn't call you Church the Bible says no man can come except who the father now a lot of us would say when we die we want to go to heaven where are you going to heaven where is your destination where you going to live who you going to connect with in heaven when Jesus came he said I go the way to the father and except I go you can come Hallelujah so he never came to take us to heaven but he's coming to take us back to the father which is he himself so when you die look you know Heaven and Earth will pass away so why you want to go to heaven it will pass away but the word will never pass away so when you die bury me in the word when you rise you're still in the word and the word cannot pass away but Heavens will pass away Earth will pass away but the word will never pass away thank you so when your parents or whoever di don't say well they are in heaven do you know you're in heaven right now ah said brother de if this was why we have all this fight around why is the church you know people are crying when the doctor give you a terrible diagnosis but he say you're already in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus yes sir but you see this physical will still have to connect with this Earthly Dimension but there's a world Beyond this world that is called Eternal hallah he's not calling you to time but he's calling you to Eternity that's what we long for church that when this Earthly is dissolved you're not coming as an old man again if my father has to raise you think I want to see him as an old man again because we have to bury him again that's double you know expenses so why oh come back come back for what more trouble this is why BR said be on the curtain of time when he saw what it was like there he said for me to go back to the body I don't want to go it's so much better here he said it's Perfection time Perfection time Perfection a brother could hug a sister and there's no sensation [Applause] thank you Lord because that body is a glorified body said there's no sex organ in that body you think Pentecostals could have preached that to us you think Peter James and John could have preached that to us sir Hallelujah but it had to take a son of man Ministry Hallelujah because the last sign Before Destruction is not California going under everybody California you see the California so what but the last sign before the destruction is the visitation of son of man and church that sign has already come and the whole world have missed it you know why they are not sheep to hear the voice of the great shepherd He said only sheep will hear my voice so anytime you play that tape church it's not just a message tape but that voice is connected to what is inside of you that you know that is more than William Branham that's the voice of God opening to me who I am hallelujah thank where I come from so even though you and your wife or your loved one may have some kind of a fight not physical amen but disagreement and you know you hear some news that your son had an accident and he died it's it's it's terrible Church but when you come to know who you are you have a hope take all you can take away from me but give me Jesus that I know that I have the power of the Resurrection in me hallelujah amen so coming back to building this bridge this man choose the best of material he tested it to make sure that he had the best because like I said you have to deal with the salt water you have to deal with the movement of water you have to deal with the soil and if it is not the best Church it will crumble so you may say okay from the time I believe this message I should be ready for Rapture no no no you got to be tested first and you know how you're going to be tested God will let the Comfort sorry the tempter come after you you cannot escape a church as long as you're a son brother said every son must be tried and tested and God went through it himself he didn't allow man to do it but he himself came and the devil said if thou be now notice what he asked not if thou be the son of Joseph the son of Mary the son of a Jew or Israel but if thou be the Son of God you see what he's haunting down you think the devil is haunting down uh the good uh neighbors Ministry member he's not looking for that church but he's looking for for a son this morning and as long as you meet that criteria rest assure he's coming after you but brother Del can something stop it no church it must come because you have to overcome not by being a member of this church but by being who you are as a son because the word is in you like the word was in Mary this is why she said be it unto me according so Mary brought forth a son but he was not a son of Joseph neither was he a son of Israel but he was a Son of God you see the difference so one is by sensation it's good church John the Baptist was a prophet but it took more than a prophet it took more than a John the Baptist it took the Holy Ghost himself the person choosing you to be his Temple his Tabernacle that he now dwells in you amen that John said I saw the Spirit descending upon him and here God said this is the one that I am well pleased thank you Lord because he overcame the test so Church whenever you're going through your test don't deem it to be you have done something wrong thank God for it because you know why it is the best time of your life do you see any Paparazzi coming around when you were sick taking your picture and putting it in the Times magazine or the newspaper no church but when you're married and you have a horse driven Carriage with you and your wife the best time of my life look at my toxedo look at her $50,000 dress huh that's not a test church that is just vanity and God is not dealing with vanity he's dealing with proven character amen so what he will allow the devil to hit you with cancer the devil would hit you with some kind of a disease that the doctors have no answer to or even cause the church to break up what are you going to do now now on the internet brother brand is not a prophet he's a false prophet what are you going to do about the message the test is going to come and he's coming after you so to be a son this morning I hope that after this service you don't want to change from a son to a church member cuz you cannot escape this test and let me tell you every test for a son is the best it's the best time of your life brother daily for all those years I'm on bed and I'm struggling I'm praying and this thing is not going and the doctor tell me I'll die you are saying that is the best time of my life yes it is because that's what God choose for you look when Jesus was going through his test all his best friends all his best buddies left him he said aren't you going to pray with me an hour people are falling asleep and blood virtually is coming through his sweat and even he himself Jesus said father why me take this cup away from me but then Revelation had a strike you're not a sensational burn but you are born of the Holy Ghost you're born of the word and your life was made manifest for this hour Hallelujah so there he said nevertheless it's not my will but thy will be done how many of us when our test comes we can say Lord thy will be done said that's all you Brethren have to tell me do you understand what I'm going through you understand the pain I'm going through and more so nobody's not even calling and asking me how I'm doing remember the prodigal who went after the prodigal no Deacon not even the pastor called him and you know that's people's excuse well if he's a pastor he's getting all the ties and he's living up why did he call me I'm away from the church for so many years why are you away from the church how did you get there that's right wasn't it your own free moral agency wasn't Adam's free moral agency wasn't he's free moral a you don't think God know you will make such a mistake but don't blame the church for it but thank God for election thank God for what he knows about you and invested in you am that one day you're going to come to yourself because as long as you're a son you must come to yourself I don't care how look how far back you would have fallen you may be in a backsliding condition but a Son of God cannot fail because they that are born of God cannot sin because his seed what is the seed the word remain it Hallelujah in you not sensation no I'm not taking away sensation but what com first is the word you cannot sin so as long as you're a son God with all what you're going through will make you come to yourself one day and you'll come to realize and you'll humble yourself like a child I have sinned not the church not the pastor you see that's the character of a real son but others will want to blame somebody else for your trouble stop blaming your wife stop blaming it's you how you handle the situation that God allow you to go through are you going to handle it by the word and say that by his stripes I'm already healed stay with the word amen and when he came to himself the Bible says he repented how many have the character to repent he said I will what return where Israel no Burlington no but to which house father my father's house you see what Jesus came for to bring us back to the father's house because in his house are many mansions in his house food Gore in his house is healing in his Jo is Joy Forever More in his house you you you cannot die in his house you cannot sin in his house you have servants and you're not a servant but you're a son Hallelujah because this Revelation is not for servants but it is for sons and he came back humbly and he repented father I have sinned and he said make me make me he thought he when he sold out that's it there's no return a servant he was humbling himself but the father already knew he made provision by predestination by election but his brother didn't have that same T about him it's like many of us you see a brother make a mistake you're ready to bury him but leave it to God he's testing he's proving and if he's a real son he will come back not by the help of any man I know no man your experience is not not by any man's hand helping you you see too often we are depending on the help of man I've made that mistake many times that when the church is there you have some members and you know they're fine and you know they pay good Tiding you know the church would be covered and everything but then all of a sudden they leave I said Lord how are we going to make out but Christ said I will build my church I never left it to you brother Dy but I I am the master builder I am the Builder yes this is not in your hands but it's in the master Builder's hands and that master builder has a repetition and that repetition is you know uh it is his name that will be questioned so when he had to choose the best material for the bridge he knows that when the bridge has to be commissioned and open if that bridge fail his name fails and I want you to know anything that man Bild will fail amen but when the master builder builds his name could never fail so anytime if Pastor with all due respect Simon or your precious Pastor now try to build this church rest ass sure it's going to fail because that's not the man you need to know but to know him Christ when he builds it there's nothing can ever destroy that bridge and it's not built with any ordinary material each and every one of you are important because you are of no ordinary material I don't care how much the color of your skin could be dark it could be L white God is not looking at that but he's looking at that inward man inside of you that when the tempter comes you're not fighting him based on what you know a man but you're fighting him based on the word what the word says about you get de behind me Satan because I didn't come here because I wanted to be here but I was chosen predestinated you love him okay I want to use a quote just to back that up a little bit from the message marriage and divorce night 1965 paragraph 153 162 says here and in him was attributes right what is an attribute you have heard those things in a Pentecostal church I'm not you know trying to put them down church that's true amen yes but this is deeper church because if you want this bridge to withstand you have to go deep oh and the only way you can go deep is not by a man but it has to take a profit because the word of God first comes not to Pentecostal Church it come to profit hallelujah amen he said an attribute is a thought now you'll get something that will border on the lesson for tonight he was his attributes that was in him now it was in him to be father amen church that's his attribute his Tau it was in him to be God so he wasn't God yet but his attribute his thought was to be God it was in him to be son you think Pentecost going to understand this CU they going to call this three person but it's God's attribute are you getting it church it was in him to be savior it was not in them it was in him to be healer and all these things here are just displaying his attributes there is nothing out of order now please again not politics I'm living in a America there's one candidate saying he's going to make it great again cuz he feels it's not good but I want you to know nothing is out of order am it's just displaying his attribute now he could not be just and make a man to fall he had to put him on equal basis of free moral agent so God doesn't force you to believe it's a choice Hallelujah to make his own choice now you got to make a choice to come to this church to be a member of this church nobody could force you church if anybody does it's of a man but as Believers we ought to know no man the only way you're supposed to be here is because he led you here and he knows he will have pastors here after his own heart so you have to first amen ask God for discernment that these pastors are men after God's heart he didn't give you a tape he said I'll give you pastors a tape can't bury you a tape can't marry you with all due respect Church a tape is not a person it's an instrument it's a mechanical instrument he didn't say I will give you mechanics I'll give you the Dynamics and the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost of operating Hallelujah a bodily mechanic but it's not your pastor it's the Holy Ghost amen but knowing he would fall now he can be a savior unless something is lost he can't be a Healer unless something is sick these things has to be that way now before there was ever any sickness as what happened in the garden God already knew that's why he wanted to be a savior and a Healer so you don't think he already know what is going on right now in your life what is happening right now in Canada he already knows it and he already has a plan so don't worry brother Christianity is AR rest it's not fussing Church believe his word God made them thus so that his great attribute could be displayed if there wasn't that he had never been a savior but we know he was even before there was a time he was a savior now scientists are trying to say the Earth is so many billion years old before the billions God was already a savior do they know that no could Pentecost teach that to you it had to take son of man God himself to go all the way back before time now Moses wrote the first four or five books in the go in Genesis but not even Moses could have given this Revelation because it was reserved right for Revelation 107 it was reserved for Malachi 4 56 and thank God we are the manifestation Hallelujah of such a revelation that we are living in the greatest time in our life in the best time of our life so regardless what comes church we are privileged to have such a revelation is it by sensation now again I'm not against sensation but it's by the word hallelujah he was a savior so there has to be something lost how is it going to be if he takes and loses it just in order to save it then it isn't Justice to his judgment he couldn't send a man to hell and be just he is kind gentle true honest and he is a great judge see he would be working against himself so so he had to put man out here and make him on free moral agency so he would [Applause] knowing would fall and the man in his own image how could he fall now you seeing daylight so he had to make a byproduct something out of the original creation now you see it see there you come then that's what fell not the original but the byproduct he made it knowing it will it would fall and it put over in the hands of Satan for a vessel of Dishonor now you know the Bible talks about there are vessels in a home some to honor and some to dishonor amen are you getting it now the very one that was made to dishonor was made by God could you tell God how to do his work but in order to fulfill the attribute of him being a savior being a redeemer he had to beat Satan on his CR because he allows Satan to take that one the byproduct you love him s where is honor bestowed today you think on that then again why she was designed this way and not like other females now you say does God have something against women why she was designed that way you see unless you understand what was in the mind of God that's right you would want to think that God is unjust well oh that's why the men you know they could get away with a lot of things but we will and everything is on us and us is always the woman the woman the woman but it took two Elizabeth and Mary to bring the Christ child one by sensation but brought the Baptist and one by the spoken word brought the Christ child and here come the devil if thou be he never went to John and sa th be but he went to the one that was born by the word so he knows church that when you are born by the word you are more than a Mr and mistress daily you're a Son of God so this morning even though your identity may be whatever name your name God is looking beyond that and the devil is hunting down to find out if you are one of them and the day he gets to know you are one of them he's coming after you but God has equipped you with the word of the hour that when he comes you don't fight him base on the strength of the church but you fight them on the basis of the word so here he says why was the woman designed so and not other females none of the other females was designed like that they are not today they can't nothing being made that way she can't do it why did he not make this female then a woman just like other females so she would just be the same way could just raise her babies then she would have her husband and live and when it comes time for her baby she would have her hus her baby why did he make her like this I can't say the he said I can't say these words and you understand what I'm trying what I'm talking about don't you if you can understand say amen he says there is young girls sitting here and young boys but you know the animal has to come to a certain time of the year then her mate then that's all you know what he means by that yes sir all right there's what you call a period of you know when the animals uh there's that season for you know reproduction that's only time the male and the female come together it is by a season an appointed season Hallelujah and God have made them in such a way that's the only time they come together but not for sensation but just the ACT to bring another cat or another dog amen but a woman it's anytime and why did he make her like that now watch his great program unfold now you know brother Bron had about a fifth grade education you understand about these things amen now you expect Einstein should have known that but this is not for Einstein church we are not in no science class we're in a holy ghost class only the Holy Ghost could reveal these things to you as we go on through here now just a perfect as perfect can be I didn't know this till the other day this is 1965 now brother BR is coming to know why God made a woman the way she's made say I didn't know now how did he know that by intellect but it's what that Spirit Lord have shown him that through all the ages they could have never got that Revelation so we're not against women church because you here this morning is more than just a woman amen you are the bride nobody's forcing you to dress the way you dress and don't cut your hair and don't wear makeup and all of these things nobody's forcing you have a free moral agency but why you do what you do by Revelation Hallelujah you come to understand you and him are one the material that he is is the same material in you and if his material is saying it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word you will say Amen glj Mary said I know no man no man could give you this Revelation Peter how you know he is a Christ he said Flesh and Blood have not revealed that to you not even your father Peter but Hallelujah my father oh Hallelujah so you're not a daughter of a Canadian but you're a daughter of the supernatural amen the heavenlies so you dressing the way you're dressing is not because the church said so you're dressing because you're a part of the word hallelujah Church look around us is Darkness we're not talking about the sunlight but just look at the condition of character of people today and brother say you want to know what condition the country is in don't look at the economics don't look at the border but look at our women look at the morals of The Country Church that is showing you where are we living right now in Satan's Eden why a woman have to dress with not short pants now it is so short church that if you don't have the spirit of Christ in you you will fall to you know we are men we have a free moral agency we have daughters we have sons we would try to tell them it is wrong to go to school like that but there's what you call peer pressure free moral agency so you can't do it but the promise is unto you Acts 2:38 it's unto you and to your children and to those as many as the Lord God shall call so you have a right you don't have power but you have authority to claim the promises of God God don't let my daughter go that way don't let my son go that way because I'm applying the token for my home you have the promis Saints brother you don't have the power but he has the power but you have authority because you're a son yes you have authority so don't sit there as though you can't do nothing the Bible says whatever you say yes on you don't even have to pray you see your son or your daughter in that condition speak to that condition Hallelujah Lord you have given me the authority speak to your wife speak to your husband because you're speaking Standing On Solid Ground you're standing as a Son of God and as long whatever you say he said I will back it up so don't worry the word has come it has made you know now by inheritance who you really are amen so when the tempter comes you don't use your power you use the word amen because the word has given me a promise you say it to any mountain and as long as you believe it in your heart God will bring it to pass look all the other church members will make you feel bad about your son or daughter because they don't have the Holy Spirit Well if you're a son if you're a pastor you know you're a Son of God how come your wife is dressing like that she has a free moral agency I can't force her cu the more you force them is the more stubborn they get but Brother D what are we going to do do what he tell you to do only believe all things are possible to them that believe you speak the word it may take 10 years for them to change but God will honor that word he promised Abraham he didn't say you'll get the son immediately took 25 years but Abraham against hope he believe in hope everybody else around you might say your son can't change your daughter can't change but be a true Abraham seed said against hope I'm going to believe for my son I'm going to believe for my daughter because I know I am a Son of God Amen don't wait for the church to change your wife or change your children this is of no man but only God and God Alone can do that church and it's not just God it's your father because the father was in the son he said I and my father are so let the devil know Hallelujah you are a son and you're the father the Holy Ghost are one and you have the promise because this is according to God's attribute you love him saints of God Amen so look what he says here now watch his great program unfold we go on there through here now just as perfect can be I don't know this till the other day why did he make her like that in the beginning like the rest of the females because it would be Unbecoming to him he is the Fountain of all Purity that's the reason he had to let Satan get a hold of her so Eve didn't fall because she wanted to to fall but in order for God's attribute to be made manifest there had to be a fall so you have to make something to make that fall come so when Satan comes Hallelujah she's a byproduct she's not the word and I want you to know you're not a byproduct you are the word hallelujah you're no byproduct Church you know they say women like to byproduct so when the man go out they said let us go to the mall he stays in the car let her walk around they'll love to buy products hallelujah amen but please I'm not saying you sisters amen I know you're good sisters amen you'll support him Hallelujah but that's That's what Satan and His World all right praise be to God so we see here that's the reason he had to let Satan get a hold of her what he done in the perversion such a creature would be would not be becoming to him originally designed for all his works that he designed in the original is in continuity all of his original work was in continuity the female dog the male dog see female cow the male cow everything in continuity all nature is in continuity seed die go into the ground just like death burial Resurrection amen the sap goes down out of a tree drops in its Leaf come back the next year with the resurrection of a new Leaf see what I meant mean everything even nature of God is all in continuity in one and here is one designed out of the continuity of God nature is so designed so it can't sin think the original creation of God could not sin you see Church why today A boy is saying I'm not a boy and a girl is saying I'm not a girl and then the schools are being pressured yes Amen to accept that as the norm could you imagine and you look at nature the cat never say want to be a dog for thousands of years they're a cat the dog the same and they don't have a soul they were not made in the image of God but why man see the prsion but what is going to correct that perversion no man could do it but the word amen so this is why we stand where we stand not because of the church but the word has been restored amen not in just portions you see Pentecost had it in portions but we have it in the fullness when that angel shall begin to sng the mystery of God should be finished church we have nothing to make an excuse that we can overcome this generation God had to allow a generation like this to come to prove there is a people yes there is a bride yes there is a church that has reputation not preach the Gospel Tabernacle not the good neighbors but the Lord Jesus I will build my church yes sir and the Gates of Hell could never Prevail against it why not because of sensation we believe in it but more than sensation we are not Elizabeth's type but we are Mary's type because even Zachariah doubted and God made him dumb Elizabeth couldn't understand how could this be but Mary a little virgin said be it unto me I need no sensation to believe this message so not because you never fell you never fall down you said pastor I want to have an experience because if I don't I'm not making it in the Rapture who told you so there are many going to fall down there are many going to shout many going to scream I'm not against it but many will miss it because they think that's the evidence but the evidence is when you can receive the revealed word the light for your day Church it is so simple now I'm not saying that because you say you believe you already have it you got to be proven you got to be tried you got to be tested sickness will come what about it's all his attributes but deep in your soul nothing will make you quit you're not a critter amen you're an overcomer so it's not the church that makes you what you are you are what you are because of predestination look even if this church has to fall apart you can't thank you Lord you know why because you are here and this church can't fall apart as long as you are here amen amen amen do you think it's your pastor cuz you know why you are predestinated to your destination so if God has to preserve this church because of you you must get to your predes that your predestinated destination Hallelujah so even though the church May close it has to open back because when you pray God will give your pastor Revival he will give the church Revival Hallelujah all because you are here you got to be fed you got to be nurtured because God is looking at you to make the destination so there's no way this church could fall apart as long as you are here and there's no way this world could fall apart until the bride leaves I don't care whether if it's conservative or liberal that has nothing to do with your Destin Nation so what is holding America I'm one of them does the Democrats know that does the Republicans know that but you know it Canada can't fall apart Because of You does truda know it does the opposition no but God knows it because in his eternal thoughts he taught of you and nothing could happen until you come to know who you are and you get out of here you love him Saints all right I know time is going I have to close glory be to God I'm going to read one more quote here from the message God's only provided place of worship 1965 and here brother R says he had in his heart before the foundation of the world a son think of it before there was even a star a molecule look right now the not only the Hubble telescope but the web they've gone so far they're exploring planets and galaxies that never ice could have seen before but God is beyond all of that he's beyond all of that church all space and time is filled with him you see how great he is yes and if you're are a part of him who do you think you are you think Canada has a place to hold you that's that's what we are Church you know what we are valued brother says we have valued more than 10 what thousand worlds could could you calculate that Jeff bezo is Rich Elon Musk is Rich this said 1927 he will be a trillionaire and everybody oh I wish I could be his cousin man man knowing a man but when you come to know your God you come to know what you where you come from you come to know how rich he is I don't care what's the color of your skin nobody could value what you are worth and only this message could have brought us to such a reality there's no money that could buy me they offered brother BR Millions but he returned it because he doesn't want to be a billy grar or all Roberts with all their big he said look up look up look at all the stars and all the heavens they belong to me and because you have chosen the hard way many of us as immigrants we come from the hard countries is that so Brother D is one of them and we come to North America because we want this soft way but remember Peter said be vigilant the devil is like a roaring lion seeking to devour so we can't be drunk at this time church we can't be sleeping at this time the hour is later than we think the knowledge of this world is foolishness with God so you're not known by your education and your degrees but you're known by Revelation who you really are you might be living in a basement don't don't don't say God I could have deserved better than this but if only he can open your eyes to see what you belong to one day you're going to be translated hallelujah thank you Lord from this terrestrial prise lordes to the celestial church and there's no rocket can take you there there's no man-made power that can take you there there's only one power that's the Holy Ghost and power that is keeping as alive you love him saints of God so you're not here you know to know well how could brother da make me richer I can't church but you're here to hear the truth amen and the truth is you were elected you were chosen even regardless of your mistakes God knows your heart and he has chosen you to predestinate you to this destination Hallelujah you love him saints of God so don't complain about the church don't complain about the pastor Hallelujah just ask God Open My Heart Lord open my ears open my eyes that I can see who I really am a Son of God and that's what the devil came if thou be I'm asking what membership Church you are but if thou be the Son of God command these students I know you're hungry I know you're weak but he said look I'm not living by bread but I'm living by every word so this bride is not just about sensation she's about every word that's the Revelation that's the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost because you can have sensation you can speak in tongues and still deny the word amen they will have a woman preacher they will have the women wearing their pants they will have the women wearing their makeup they will have them wearing their lipsti they will have them cut in their and they are Bishop when Paul say it's an Abomination this is why church when you look around you how many can you see like you dressing moderately now okay you have the Muslims also wear their long clothing from head to toe but they don't have Revelation that's by man that's by law but this is not a law church this is a revelation you don't do it because you afraid that they will kill you you do it because you are the word hallelujah you go to school why do you wear long clothes why don't you dress like the rest because I am the word word what are you talking about we have seminaries we send our doctors there doctor doctors can't give you this Revelation It could only come by the experience when the Holy Ghost comes down and Quicken that word in your heart you love him so closing Saints he had to put them in a free moral agency but that man fell but the grips culter God who made man from the dust of the earth he didn't settle for that he started making man again he made an Noah he died drunk he made a Moses that failed to keep his word he made prophets that run in the time of trouble and he kept building and holding until after a while he wanted a masterpiece to reflect him his nature what was in his heart was a son what a son should be one day down at Jordan after that Masterpiece had been formed and made here he come descending down on the wings of of a dove said this is him he was so ined with his this masterpiece until he struck him on Calvary Church that's the best time of your life you know when everybody following you know Bram had thousands following but when the word had to be open everybody started to leave even many message Believers message pastors are leaving and it look as though well this message is a mess that he would die for the rest of us that's imperfect that through this shedding of his blood he might bring many masterpieces being a bride not a church SS but a bride to his son Masterpiece is scarred because the enthus enthus of God to see such a masterpiece he struck him for us all yes there he died to perfect we who are imperfect yes Hallelujah the Masterpiece so in closing sense see brother D just a visitor please don't ever lift me up above your pastor God has chosen him a man after his own heart to feed you to bless you thankes we're just a part of the fight for but you must have a pastor any true son or daughter of God ask them this question if you're a Believer who's your pastor that you stream from all over the world but who is your pastor you must have a pastor and the one that God has given to you cherish him pray for him I'm just a man like him we will make mistakes but the Holy Ghost won't so all you have to ask for God let your Holy Spirit fill him cuz I will go back to New York but you have to continue to come here now don't don't deny your service and stream brother daily that's Antichrist amen I hear amen your pastor comes first you love God because he said he will give you brother Simon didn't make him but God gave him and I Believe As Long as You observe those basic principles God will bless you God will put the words in his mouth to feed your soul that you will make a church but I beg you pray for me God keep me humble because I need the prayers of the Saints we all as pastors need a prayer of the Saints but if you do your part God will do the greater part so just believe you are chosen you are elected you are Sons and Daughters of God you're not Canadians even though you have a passport but we have something called the Holy Ghost seal when he comes what he's looking for is not your passport but he's looking for that seal yes sir and you know what a seal means you're a finished product you're already sealed to the day of redemption so be Not Afraid church God has given to us all that we have need of to make it you love him let us stand God bless you [Applause] amen praise God God bless you my brother wonderful wonderful amen how many enjoyed that praise God well if you've been paying attention you'll you'll realize that the Holy Spirit just uh continued right along where we left off amen because the last couple Services we were preaching on overcoming in Christ and we took the same scripture and the Holy Spirit you know this is the supernatural element that we need to recognize as the body of Christ that the holy spirit is a living God that he is feeding his sons and daughters giving them the word by Revelation to overcome the temptation of this age amen praise God and if you heard it here today the master builder the master has a reputation and you know what the master has a reputation to do keep his word and he's going to keep it in you regardless of the circumstances regardless of the conditions regardless of what you're going through right now you need to accept the word and believe that greater is he that is in you than he that is in that situation that you might be facing amen give me a key of f it's the Holy Ghost and power and it's keeping me alive it's
