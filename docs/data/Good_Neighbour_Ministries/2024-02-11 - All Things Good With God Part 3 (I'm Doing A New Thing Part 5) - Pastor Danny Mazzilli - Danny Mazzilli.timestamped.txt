[6:29] morning as I will enter into his gates
[6:31] with
[6:32] Thanksgiving and I was reading on David

[6:39] Thanksgiving and into his courts with
[6:42] praise be
[6:44] thankful unto him bless his name for the
[6:47] Lord is good and his Mercy is

[6:56] Thanksgiving and I wrote something down

[7:25] the thoughts would go through my mind
[7:27] but the Lord said to me Fe
[7:30] fear is
[7:32] torment but I start to realize fear is
[7:34] torment because that's what it is you
[7:36] come up here you're making mistakes
[7:37] because you're
[7:38] fearful but I could come now with
[7:40] Thanksgiving the key to open the door

[42:50] [Music]
[42:54] 28 hey amen praise
[42:58] God okay we're going to read a scripture
[43:01] and then we're going to have you sit
[43:02] down let's put up our first scripture
[43:09] amen Genesis
[43:11] 37 verses
[43:14] 5-9 today we're going to be looking at
[43:16] Joseph we're going to be looking at his
[43:18] life we're going to be looking at his
[43:19] character we're going to be looking at
[43:22] at his responses to the challenges that
[43:25] he came across and we know that this is
[43:27] one story that that that certainly gives
[43:30] and shows a tremendous amount of God's
[43:34] you know purpose and plan for his life
[43:37] and as we're looking at these scriptures
[43:39] and as we're looking at Joseph I want
[43:41] you to see yourself amen praise God it
[43:44] says here uh 37: 5-9 and Joseph dreamed
[43:48] a dream and he told it his Brethren and
[43:52] they hated him yet the more and he said
[43:56] unto them here I pray you this dream
[43:59] which I have dreamed for behold we were
[44:02] binding sheep in the field and low my
[44:06] sheep
[44:07] arose and also I stood upright and
[44:12] behold your sheaves stood round about
[44:16] and made abstinence to my sheath and his
[44:20] Brethren said to him shalt thou indeed
[44:24] Reign Over Us or shalt thou indeed have
[44:28] dominion over us and they hated him yet
[44:31] the more for his dreams and for his
[44:35] words amen you may be
[44:40] seated listen to brother brandham here
[44:42] in a quote in 1956 Joseph meeting his
[44:45] brother and brother Bram says now Joseph
[44:48] was born of his father and was loved of
[44:52] his father and hated of his Brethren now
[44:55] notice notice a perfect picture of the
[44:58] Lord Jesus I want you to notice how his
[45:01] life just typed in the Old Testament
[45:05] everything typed now look back there and
[45:09] see the
[45:11] picture
[45:14] oh I just had something happen here on
[45:16] my
[45:21] computer excuse me one
[45:24] second
[45:26] these things come up on the
[45:33] computer and then if you hit the wrong
[45:36] button I what I should do is I got to
[45:38] disconnect from the internet because
[45:40] something came up and I touched it and
[45:41] it shut down my page praise
[45:46] God and I have it all here
[45:49] okay here we go and so he says here he
[45:54] says look back there and see the picture
[45:57] there is the Shadow and you see what the
[45:59] positive is now notice Joseph being a
[46:03] type of Christ a type of the church a
[46:07] type of the Holy Spirit type he was a
[46:10] prince of prosperity just as Christ is
[46:14] just as the church
[46:17] today notice again that when he was born
[46:20] his father loved him and he made him a
[46:23] coat of many colors now there are only
[46:26] seven perfect colors in the colors all
[46:29] others are made off of these colors and
[46:32] the coat perhaps had colors in it of
[46:35] seven different colors Stripes of colors
[46:38] into the coat that the father made if
[46:41] you notice maybe Jacob didn't understand
[46:45] that at the time that signified promised
[46:49] one when God gave Noah the rainbow sign
[46:52] the seven colors it was the promise or a
[46:56] covenant one God had made a covenant
[46:59] that he would that that he would destroy
[47:01] the world no more with water and God's
[47:05] covenant was also carried over through
[47:08] Jacob into Joseph Abraham was election
[47:12] and Isaac was
[47:14] justification and
[47:16] justification and Israel was Grace and
[47:20] Joseph was
[47:22] Perfection that was the only one that
[47:25] had the color
[47:26] we see Jesus sitting upon the throne
[47:29] with the colors rainbow around him in
[47:32] Revelations 1 it was God's covenant with
[47:35] the people Christ here it is oh how I
[47:39] want you to see it Christ is God's
[47:42] covenant with his people not
[47:45] denominations but Christ is God's
[47:49] covenant as Joseph was hated and we know
[47:53] he was hated by his brothers so Christ
[47:56] will be hated when his word comes to the
[48:00] people amen and so here we can see that
[48:04] Joseph you know Joseph didn't try to
[48:07] have
[48:08] dreams okay when we're looking at all of
[48:11] this we want to see how you know
[48:13] everything types Jesus Christ all right
[48:16] and the and you've seen you know from
[48:17] the from the uh the quote that it
[48:20] doesn't only type Christ but it also
[48:22] types the church okay and so everything
[48:24] that we're talking about about here is
[48:26] talking about Christ and you because we
[48:31] are Christ made manifest in this day and
[48:34] in this hour bringing the word to the
[48:37] people bringing the word to the world
[48:39] right now okay and so here Joseph he
[48:43] didn't try to have
[48:45] dreams he just he just received the
[48:48] dreams you didn't try to receive
[48:52] Revelation because that's what dreams
[48:54] are when when God God wants to give
[48:56] Revelation he can give it in the night
[48:58] time or he can give it to you plain
[49:00] straight to your heart he can reveal
[49:02] things in your life that you never
[49:04] thought was even possible you didn't try
[49:07] to you know put on this Revelation that
[49:10] God has given you you didn't try to you
[49:12] know uh just pretend that you knew Jesus
[49:15] Christ no no when the Revelation came it
[49:18] became a reality and when it became a
[49:20] reality in your life and you started to
[49:23] express it in your life you start to
[49:25] notice that the world around you starts
[49:27] to change it doesn't really want to
[49:29] accept that Supernatural element that
[49:32] wait a minute you mean you know
[49:34] something that I don't
[49:36] know you mean all of a sudden you know
[49:38] more about God than I do that's what his
[49:42] brothers were were were trying to say
[49:44] they they they they heard the dream they
[49:46] heard the interpretation and you saw the
[49:48] way they responded what you mean you're
[49:50] going to be over over us you mean we're
[49:53] going to bow to you no this is all part
[49:56] of God's plan this was all part of God's
[49:59] showing and we're going to be looking at
[50:01] all of this to see that God has a great
[50:04] plan for the world Amen and Jesus Christ
[50:08] is the focal plan for the world it's not
[50:12] any other religion it is Jesus Christ
[50:15] the same yesterday today and forever
[50:18] amen so he didn't he didn't choose his
[50:21] election go to the next slide what we're
[50:24] looking at here
[50:26] okay in um Genesis 37
[50:35] 9-11 he goes on he says and he dreamed
[50:38] yet another dream now this is the second
[50:40] dream and told it his Brethren and said
[50:44] behold I have dreamed the dream more and
[50:47] behold the Sun and the Moon and the 11
[50:50] stars made abstinence to me and he told
[50:53] it to his father and to his Brethren and
[50:56] his father rebuked
[50:58] him imagine that his own
[51:02] family his father that that that Joseph
[51:06] was his favorite you see but but then
[51:09] you got to see that there's the human
[51:11] part and you got to see that there's
[51:13] election amen and he told it to his
[51:16] father and his and his brother his
[51:17] father rebuked him and said unto him
[51:19] what is this dream that thou has dreamed
[51:22] shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren
[51:24] indeed come to bow down ourselves to
[51:27] thee to the Earth and his brother his
[51:31] Brethren eny envied him but his father
[51:35] observed the same next slide we're going
[51:39] to be looking here at Joseph's
[51:41] election election is not something that
[51:44] that that you know we choose no you know
[51:47] we decide to elect ourselves we don't
[51:49] elect ourselves to be a part of God's
[51:52] economy all right you know this whole
[51:55] plan of redemption once we you know once
[51:57] our our our understanding was opened and
[52:00] and we began to recognize what it was
[52:02] that that Christianity was all about we
[52:05] came to realize that it takes God to to
[52:08] call you personally amen this is an
[52:11] election that goes beyond human
[52:13] understanding okay we read in the
[52:15] scriptures that we were called from
[52:18] before the foundations of the world it's
[52:21] not something that that we decided to
[52:23] join this church I did not decide to
[52:26] join this ministry it was God that
[52:29] decided that it was time for me time for
[52:33] you wherever you are at the certain time
[52:36] in your life God decided that it was
[52:38] time for you to be placed as a son and
[52:41] daughter of God Amen to be placed in the
[52:44] body of Christ so that he could manifest
[52:47] his word and show the world that he had
[52:49] a plan amen praise God glory to God and
[52:54] so this election is of god it's not our
[53:00] choosing Joseph never chose Jacob heard
[53:04] the dream his brothers heard the dream
[53:06] they didn't like it but yet it was God's
[53:10] purpose it was God's plan God was
[53:12] starting to show something that he was
[53:14] going to do and in that dream is all of
[53:17] Joseph's
[53:19] experiences wound up into that dream
[53:21] that eventually his brothers and his
[53:25] father and all of of of the all of
[53:28] Canaan all the people would come to know
[53:31] that Joseph was a perfect type of Jesus
[53:34] Christ amen the Lord had a Plan of
[53:36] Salvation so to understand what is
[53:39] happening and get the bigger picture
[53:41] we're going to need to reflect on
[53:42] Joseph's life that's what we're going to
[53:45] do today reflect on his life and at the
[53:47] same time I want you to to to just you
[53:49] know sit back relax and see where you
[53:52] fit into all of this amen praise praise
[53:55] God and here in uh in his wonders to
[53:58] perform brother Bram says and little did
[54:01] maybe Joseph know that all this was just
[54:04] about to happen you know Joseph didn't
[54:07] understand those dreams fully all he
[54:10] knew is that he had these dreams and
[54:12] they were real to him but little did he
[54:14] know Joseph that all this was just about
[54:17] to happen but we don't have to know
[54:20] everything no that's the thing we just
[54:23] believe by faith and walk on God God
[54:26] doesn't doesn't have to tell us all his
[54:29] plans amen God doesn't have to tell you
[54:32] exactly where you're you're going to end
[54:34] up you know but but God is uh you know
[54:38] just letting you see enough so that when
[54:40] you go through certain situations and
[54:43] through certain Temptations and certain
[54:45] trials that there's going to be
[54:47] something in you that's going to rise up
[54:50] he's just giving you enough to know that
[54:52] it's going to work for good amen and so
[54:55] he doesn't have to give it just how he's
[54:56] going to make the Morning Star shine in
[54:59] the morning just just move on anyhow God
[55:03] takes care of his own and when you're
[55:05] prayed for being sick you don't have to
[55:09] worry about just how God's going to move
[55:11] that
[55:12] cancer how God's going to make that
[55:15] crippled limb to come
[55:17] straight just go forward in faith that's
[55:21] up to God to take care of that you don't
[55:24] have to worry whether whether you'll
[55:25] keep your job if you accept Christ as
[55:28] your savior you don't have to worry
[55:30] whether the boss will be angry or your
[55:33] neighbor will turn on you down or your
[55:36] mother will say that you're you've lost
[55:38] your mind or your dad turn you away from
[55:41] home just go forward God will take care
[55:47] of the rest of
[55:49] it when we look at Joseph he's one of
[55:52] the most inspiring characters in the
[55:54] whole whole
[55:56] scriptures unlike his often earing
[55:59] father Jacob you know we all know the
[56:01] story about Jacob and how you know Jacob
[56:04] was you know he was a deceiver all he
[56:06] was interested in was the was the
[56:08] birthright amen but Jacob but Joseph um
[56:12] you know Joseph his his his character is
[56:15] a lot different he was one of the few
[56:18] people who were able to maintain his
[56:22] spiritual Poise at a peak
[56:25] of success as well as is in the midst of
[56:28] all the trouble that he went through
[56:30] even though his tremendous uh abilities
[56:34] his patience it all reflected through
[56:37] tribulation that he was faithful in Fame
[56:41] and success and in for and and even in a
[56:43] forgiving spirit amen all tributes to
[56:47] his character he displayed a character
[56:50] no matter what he was going through he
[56:52] showed that something was real in his
[56:55] heart and all that we go through in in
[56:58] life and all the situations that we have
[57:00] to deal with in day in and day out
[57:03] there's something inside of us that's
[57:06] going to rise up and show the character
[57:08] of Christ amen praise God it's because
[57:12] he knew God Amen his faithfulness in
[57:15] Fame his faithfulness in forgiving and
[57:18] all the attributes of his character what
[57:20] stands out above all else is his
[57:23] conviction that God had a specific
[57:27] purpose in his life he didn't fully
[57:30] understand it but he knew that that that
[57:33] had to be God because every time that he
[57:35] would face the worst situations he would
[57:38] he would just say God has a purpose in
[57:41] this amen he moved forward in a quiet
[57:45] conviction that his life was not merely
[57:48] a succession of
[57:50] coincidences but it was actually being
[57:52] directed by the power of of God and we
[57:55] can look at our own lives and know that
[57:58] listen the direction that we're moving
[58:00] in this is a god directed Life once
[58:03] you've been born again once you've
[58:05] received the spirit of God once you've
[58:08] recognized that God is a reality you're
[58:10] no longer living your own life the way
[58:13] that you did before you start to realize
[58:16] that your life is being orchestrated by
[58:18] the power of God amen amen praise God
[58:22] Joseph from a young age he believed God
[58:24] had a Destiny for him for his greatness
[58:27] in dreams God assured Joseph that he
[58:30] would rise to a position of leadership
[58:33] over his brothers and even over his
[58:36] parents it was revealed to him but he
[58:39] kept it all within
[58:41] him from Joseph's point of view these
[58:44] dreams were evidence of divine
[58:48] blessing listen when God allows you to
[58:51] recognize his word recognize that he
[58:53] sent a prophet recognize what he's doing
[58:56] in your day you need to realize that
[58:59] this is a tremendous blessing in your
[59:01] life amen this is something that goes
[59:04] beyond what you could have possibly put
[59:07] together or figured out amen praise God
[59:11] Jo Joseph enjoyed the fact that this was
[59:15] something that was revealed to him in
[59:16] his heart and it kept him uh
[59:20] so when we look at um you know Hebrews 1
[59:26] and two it says hath in these last days
[59:31] spoken to us by his son whom he hath
[59:34] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[59:37] also he made the worlds we need to
[59:40] realize that God is speaking directly to
[59:44] you lip to ear now at this stage in your
[59:47] walk you've got the ability to walk with
[59:50] God personally amen he's chosen now that
[59:54] that he's going to speak to us through
[59:56] the word of God through his son amen and
[1:00:00] and uh it it is true that God spoke
[1:00:03] through dreams like he spoke to to
[1:00:06] Joseph and to some people in the past
[1:00:09] but even then it was a rare or
[1:00:12] occurrence okay it's not often but but
[1:00:15] watch he says here in 1 John 4 veres 1
[1:00:22] to 4 we need to realize that it's not
[1:00:25] just dreams we need to be careful of
[1:00:28] dreams we need to be careful of the
[1:00:29] occult we need to be careful of you know
[1:00:32] watching all these YouTube videos that
[1:00:33] try to give interpretations on the word
[1:00:35] of God and try to give interpretations
[1:00:38] of the end time and all of these
[1:00:40] different things because there's Spirits
[1:00:42] behind those things okay we need to
[1:00:45] realize that that that dreams can be
[1:00:48] given but yet we need to run them
[1:00:50] through the word of God and and in 1
[1:00:52] John chapter 4 it says beloved beloved
[1:00:55] believe not every Spirit but try the
[1:00:58] spirits whether they are of God because
[1:01:01] many false prophets are gone out into
[1:01:03] the world hereby know ye the spirit of
[1:01:07] God every spirit that confesseth that
[1:01:10] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of
[1:01:14] God now we're now we're not putting this
[1:01:17] in the day when Jesus walked on the
[1:01:18] earth we're putting this into our
[1:01:21] day Jesus Christ is now in human
[1:01:25] flesh you believe that
[1:01:30] amen he said on that day you shall know
[1:01:33] that I am in the father ye in me and I
[1:01:35] in you so we need to realize the
[1:01:38] presence of God in this day and in this
[1:01:41] hour so that we can filter things only
[1:01:44] by the word of God only through the
[1:01:47] revealed word for this day and this hour
[1:01:50] and so if if if you tell somebody about
[1:01:53] the reality of God you know your
[1:01:55] experience well what makes you different
[1:01:57] from anybody else what makes you
[1:01:59] different from other Christians out
[1:02:00] there What Makes You Different is that
[1:02:02] you've actually come into contact with
[1:02:05] Christ
[1:02:06] himself he's walking and talking and
[1:02:10] living and moving in your life amen and
[1:02:14] you've recognized that and that is the
[1:02:16] evidence that the spirit of God is in
[1:02:18] you but when somebody rejects that that
[1:02:22] is not the spirit of God and watch and
[1:02:25] come in the flesh is so so uh and every
[1:02:29] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[1:02:32] Christ is come in the flesh is not of
[1:02:34] God and this is that Spirit of
[1:02:37] antichrist whereof ye have heard that it
[1:02:40] should come and even now already is in
[1:02:43] the
[1:02:45] world ye are of God little children and
[1:02:49] have overcome them because greater is he
[1:02:53] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:02:56] world Amen praise God so Paul is giving
[1:03:00] us an excellent guideline on how to
[1:03:03] orient our thinking we need to we need
[1:03:06] to make sure that we're not too focused
[1:03:09] on you know too many
[1:03:10] interpretations of you know that that
[1:03:13] are being put out there in the world you
[1:03:15] can spend hours and hours just listening
[1:03:18] to different interpretations on God's
[1:03:20] word God's word is of no private interpr
[1:03:24] ration you want to know what the word
[1:03:26] says read the word if you don't
[1:03:29] understand it pray get on your knees and
[1:03:32] pray that the Lord will give you a
[1:03:33] revelation of the
[1:03:35] word amen praise God in Philippians 4
[1:03:40] verse 8 Paul says to us finally Brethren
[1:03:43] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:03:45] things are noble whatsoever things are
[1:03:48] just whatever things are pure whatever
[1:03:51] things are lovely whatever things are of
[1:03:53] good report
[1:03:55] if there is any virtue and if there is
[1:03:57] anything praiseworthy meditate on those
[1:04:01] things so in other words focus on the
[1:04:04] word meditate on the word amen praise
[1:04:09] God let's go on
[1:04:10] now next
[1:04:12] scripture Genesis
[1:04:15] 37 we're going to move along here it
[1:04:18] says and it came to pass when Joseph was
[1:04:21] come unto his Brethren that they
[1:04:23] stripped Joseph out of his coat his coat
[1:04:26] of many colors that was on him and they
[1:04:29] took him and cast him into a pit and the
[1:04:33] pit was empty there was no water in it
[1:04:36] and they sat down to eat bread and they
[1:04:39] lifted up their eyes and looked and
[1:04:41] behold a company of ishmaelites came
[1:04:44] from Gilead with their camels bearing
[1:04:46] spicery and bomb and myrr going to carry
[1:04:51] it down to Egypt and Judah said unto his
[1:04:54] Brethren what profit is it if we slay
[1:04:57] our brother and conceal his blood Come
[1:05:00] and Let Us sell him to the ishmaelites
[1:05:03] and let us not and and let not our hand
[1:05:05] be upon him for he is our brother and
[1:05:08] our flesh and his Brethren were content
[1:05:11] then their passed by midianite
[1:05:13] merchantmen and they drew and lifted up
[1:05:16] Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to
[1:05:18] the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver
[1:05:21] and they brought Joseph into Egypt next
[1:05:25] slide here we're looking at Joseph's
[1:05:29] rejection you know uh he
[1:05:32] was just imagine his own family his
[1:05:37] brothers those that he grew up with but
[1:05:40] he all he always knew that there was
[1:05:42] something different about him he always
[1:05:44] knew that you know that that he was not
[1:05:47] like them but these brothers were so
[1:05:49] wicked that they took him and they
[1:05:52] actually threw him into to a pit you
[1:05:55] know that's why these days you hear oh
[1:05:57] man that's the
[1:05:59] pits you know because sometimes we come
[1:06:02] into situations and times in our lives
[1:06:05] where you know things are just not
[1:06:07] working out things just aren't working
[1:06:09] out good everything is just looking like
[1:06:12] it's all bad amen but things don't stay
[1:06:16] all bad you see God has a purpose and a
[1:06:19] plan for those times when things go bad
[1:06:22] you might find yourself in a dry place
[1:06:24] he was in a pit there was it said
[1:06:26] clearly there was not even any water
[1:06:28] there he couldn't even quench his thirst
[1:06:31] they had they they were thinking they
[1:06:33] were just going to leave him in that pit
[1:06:35] and he would just stay there and he
[1:06:37] would just die there of starvation and
[1:06:40] of lack of water and sometimes you might
[1:06:43] find yourself in a situation where it's
[1:06:46] just dry nothing is happening nothing is
[1:06:49] real to you as much as you know as much
[1:06:52] as you want to to be Ze and as much as
[1:06:54] you want you know to to do good you you
[1:06:58] find yourself in a terrible
[1:07:00] situation it's an ugly time it's a
[1:07:03] terrible time but I want you to know
[1:07:06] that though God had placed Joseph in
[1:07:09] that pit it was because God had a plan
[1:07:12] for
[1:07:14] Joseph God inspired uh Judah to not kill
[1:07:19] their brother right there and then why
[1:07:22] because God had a plan for Joseph God
[1:07:25] has a plan for your life you can look
[1:07:28] back on times and situations where
[1:07:31] things didn't appear good but God
[1:07:34] allowed you to stay in a pit for a
[1:07:36] little while but then he's got a plan to
[1:07:38] bring you out of the pit amen praise God
[1:07:42] they took him and they threw him into
[1:07:43] the pit we aren't told the kind of pit
[1:07:46] that it is but it's a sister cut into
[1:07:49] the Rock to gather water it it you know
[1:07:52] it's a bottle shaped a narrow necked pit
[1:07:56] once you're down there you can't get out
[1:07:58] unless somebody brings you out amen the
[1:08:01] pit was empty there was no water in it
[1:08:03] praise God the bad news is that he will
[1:08:06] die of thirst after a few days and a
[1:08:09] truly miserable way to die that's you
[1:08:13] know something that you know that their
[1:08:15] brothers thought maybe they would have
[1:08:17] in mind but then all of a sudden
[1:08:19] inspiration strikes one of the brothers
[1:08:21] let's sell them let's make some money I
[1:08:24] want you to see here this is all a type
[1:08:27] of Jesus Christ all a type of what God
[1:08:30] was doing and showing in the life of
[1:08:32] Joseph with their brothers stripped and
[1:08:35] imprisoned uh in the sistern they they
[1:08:38] callously sat down and ate food can you
[1:08:43] imagine the kind of hatred that these
[1:08:46] brothers had that they could throw their
[1:08:47] brother into a pit and then they could
[1:08:49] go sit down and have a
[1:08:51] meal I'll tell you the devil some
[1:08:54] sometimes just rejoices when you're down
[1:08:57] he thinks oh boy I got him now I'm going
[1:08:59] to go and have a feast because I got him
[1:09:01] out of the way he got him down in
[1:09:03] sickness I got him fighting sickness
[1:09:06] over and over and over again it's he's
[1:09:08] going to stay down he ain't going to
[1:09:09] stay down not if the spirit of God is in
[1:09:12] there amen he's going to get right back
[1:09:15] up again because something is going to
[1:09:17] Quicken him out of the pit praise God
[1:09:20] hallelujah but the devil he can't he
[1:09:23] can't keep you
[1:09:26] anywhere so here now I want you to see
[1:09:29] the timing on all this now I want you
[1:09:31] like you know when you get a chance go
[1:09:33] back and read Genesis
[1:09:36] 37 um read you know actually start right
[1:09:39] from the story where Joseph you know
[1:09:41] starts his dreams there in chapter 37
[1:09:44] and read all the way through right
[1:09:45] through to chapter 50 you're going to
[1:09:48] see events and circumstances that took
[1:09:51] place you know there was one thing when
[1:09:53] Joseph Joseph was asked by his father to
[1:09:56] go and find his brothers to go and check
[1:09:59] on them he went to a certain place he
[1:10:03] went to sheam because that's where the
[1:10:05] father thought that they actually were
[1:10:08] but while he went there do you know that
[1:10:10] Joseph met somebody they don't give his
[1:10:12] name they don't say who it was but that
[1:10:15] individual overheard the brothers
[1:10:18] talking and heard them say that we're
[1:10:20] going to dotham and so that individual
[1:10:24] was placed there for a purpose amen you
[1:10:27] see God knew that that that that Joseph
[1:10:30] had to go to dotham God knew that Joseph
[1:10:34] was going to go into the pit God knew
[1:10:37] exactly everything that Joseph would
[1:10:40] have to deal with and all the
[1:10:43] circumstances so so we need to see that
[1:10:46] God is the one that's orchestrating all
[1:10:48] of this amen praise God and so um
[1:10:54] they drew uh Joseph out of the pit and
[1:10:57] they
[1:10:58] sold Joseph to the Israelites because
[1:11:01] God needed Joseph where in
[1:11:06] Egypt you know sometimes things happen
[1:11:09] in your lives sometimes you get a
[1:11:12] certain job you get something that that
[1:11:15] comes your way and you're wondering you
[1:11:17] know or maybe your parents decided that
[1:11:19] they had to move to a certain city and
[1:11:22] they left this city to come to that City
[1:11:25] and you wonder boy if I hadn't to come
[1:11:28] to that City I would have never met that
[1:11:32] individual if I hadn't been at the time
[1:11:35] in my life where I was actually looking
[1:11:37] to buy furniture I would have never met
[1:11:40] brother
[1:11:41] Gabriel you see but God had a plan in
[1:11:44] each and every one of our lives and he
[1:11:47] orchestrated in such Perfection that we
[1:11:50] could not miss this that we are now
[1:11:56] experiencing you are not a Christian by
[1:11:59] coincidence you are not somebody that's
[1:12:02] a part of this ministry by
[1:12:04] coincidence God had orchestrated and
[1:12:07] purposely planned all of your footsteps
[1:12:12] amen all we see in the last verse of the
[1:12:16] chapter that we just read is
[1:12:19] that
[1:12:21] Joseph was sold into Egypt and he was
[1:12:25] sold as a slave unto
[1:12:28] pontier let's go to the next
[1:12:31] scripture today is just a
[1:12:34] simple review and and look at Joseph's
[1:12:39] life amen in Genesis 39: 1-4 it says and
[1:12:44] Joseph was brought down to Egypt and
[1:12:47] pontier an officer of pharaoh captain of
[1:12:50] the Guard an Egyptian brought him of the
[1:12:53] hands of the ishmaelites which had
[1:12:56] brought him down tither and the Lord was
[1:13:00] with
[1:13:01] Joseph I want you to notice
[1:13:04] that the Lord was with
[1:13:10] Joseph and he was a prosperous man and
[1:13:13] he was in the house of his master the
[1:13:16] Egyptian and his master saw that the
[1:13:18] Lord was with him and that the Lord made
[1:13:22] all that that he did to prosper in his
[1:13:25] hand and Joseph found Grace in his sight
[1:13:28] and he served him and he made him
[1:13:31] overseer over his house and all he had
[1:13:36] he put into Joseph's hands glory to God
[1:13:40] listen Joseph would never have been
[1:13:43] enslaved in Egypt he never would have
[1:13:46] faced a Temptation posed by pontier wife
[1:13:50] he never would have been thrown in
[1:13:52] prison so so so would never have met
[1:13:56] Pharaoh's Baker and cup Bearer he never
[1:13:59] would have had the opportunity to
[1:14:01] interpret Pharaoh's dreams and as a
[1:14:03] result rise to the highest position in
[1:14:05] the Egyptian government save that of
[1:14:08] pharaoh himself he never would have
[1:14:10] rescued the Egyptians from famine and so
[1:14:13] gained virtually unquestioned Authority
[1:14:16] in the kingdom and consequently he never
[1:14:19] would have been in a position both to
[1:14:21] save his family from starvation and more
[1:14:25] important still save them from the sins
[1:14:28] that had overspread their life as sons
[1:14:31] and brothers without this history there
[1:14:34] never would have been an exodus from
[1:14:37] Egypt the defying Redemptive Act of
[1:14:40] Israel's history and the precursor of
[1:14:43] the atonement of Jesus Christ the son of
[1:14:47] God everything was being expressed I
[1:14:50] want you to see how all of these things
[1:14:52] would have never happened had he not
[1:14:57] been hated by his
[1:15:00] brothers none of this would have
[1:15:02] happened could have happened if Joseph
[1:15:04] had gone straight to dotham and hadn't
[1:15:07] lost time looking for his brothers near
[1:15:09] sheam and if he hadn't happened upon
[1:15:12] that stranger when he did a man who knew
[1:15:15] where the brothers could be found
[1:15:16] because he happened to have overheard
[1:15:18] them
[1:15:19] talking he happened to be in the exact
[1:15:22] place to have heard them say let us go
[1:15:25] to dotham listen everything was not a
[1:15:28] coincidence everything was ordained of
[1:15:31] God Amen everything was in the plan of
[1:15:34] God our lives are under Divine
[1:15:36] Providence of God thanes Amen whether we
[1:15:39] realize it or not our lives are exactly
[1:15:42] where God wants us right now amen you

[1:17:33] things that are utterly disconnected
[1:17:35] from one another he is working out a
[1:17:38] marvelous unified perfect
[1:17:41] plan that is going to bring together his
[1:17:45] gracious purpose in our lives amen and
[1:17:49] when we often we often you know we we
[1:17:52] wonder well why me why why am I in this

[1:17:56] the parts of the jigsaw puzzle and maybe

[1:18:31] his will you don't demand
[1:18:35] God you you surrender to God Amen you
[1:18:39] surrender to his will when the more
[1:18:41] important question should be why is this
[1:18:44] happening right
[1:18:46] now that's what's more important God's
[1:18:49] timing is always perfect am God doesn't
[1:18:53] do things out of cater he does things in
[1:18:58] a perfect time you know we were talking
[1:19:01] about that yesterday when you know
[1:19:02] brother Alvin and I were putting up that
[1:19:04] new sign and you know how how the Lord
[1:19:07] just worked it all out you know I said
[1:19:08] to Alvin I said you know brother Alvin
[1:19:10] look at this beautiful day God gave us
[1:19:11] this day today we're able to paint you
[1:19:14] know because the paint will dry in this
[1:19:16] weather with the sun and everything else
[1:19:18] you know I told them I said I actually
[1:19:20] went to go pick up the sign on Tuesday
[1:19:22] you know with the intention to come here
[1:19:24] and maybe do it on Wednesday and you
[1:19:26] know he had told me that it was going to
[1:19:28] be ready on Tuesday and so I thought
[1:19:30] okay I'll just drive by and when I went
[1:19:31] there the sign wasn't ready he says oh
[1:19:34] I'm sorry you know I couldn't get it
[1:19:35] done he says but I should have it done
[1:19:37] by
[1:19:38] tomorrow you know tomorrow afternoon
[1:19:40] sometime I said that's fine that's no
[1:19:42] problem just just send me a a message
[1:19:44] when it's ready and we'll come and grab
[1:19:46] it and so it all worked out perfectly
[1:19:49] fine I ended up going by on Thursday
[1:19:52] afternoon and there it was it was all
[1:19:54] ready to go and then I text right away
[1:19:57] and brother Alvin within a minute said
[1:20:00] I'm I'm available tomorrow to do it I
[1:20:02] looked at the weather I said praise God
[1:20:04] look at how this is all coming together
[1:20:07] you see God has timing I want you to
[1:20:11] know God has timing I know I'm giving
[1:20:12] you a simple example of God's timing but
[1:20:15] let me tell you there's things that are
[1:20:17] coming into your life and I want you to
[1:20:19] be still and know that in God's time
[1:20:21] it's going to be beautiful
[1:20:24] it's going to end up just beautiful when
[1:20:26] when Alvin and I got done we sat back
[1:20:28] and we looked at it we said man this is
[1:20:30] beautiful Hallelujah it looks fantastic
[1:20:34] and all we could do was say thank you
[1:20:36] Lord amen praise God you know when God
[1:20:38] wants to do things he just does it in
[1:20:41] his time and under his inspiration and
[1:20:44] you know if if we just surrender to God
[1:20:47] and just allow him to take control you
[1:20:49] will see wonders that he will perform in
[1:20:52] your life
[1:20:53] amen so the question should be more you
[1:20:56] know um
[1:20:59] uh but but what is his timing wait on
[1:21:02] the Lord and it's clear one of the great
[1:21:04] lessons that Joseph himself was learning
[1:21:07] in those days was precisely that to wait
[1:21:11] on the
[1:21:13] Lord you know you know we're just going
[1:21:16] to see certain characteristics of of
[1:21:18] Joseph here you know and so this is for
[1:21:21] Joseph and for us too a summons to Bow
[1:21:25] ourselves before his
[1:21:27] sovereignty to surrender to God's
[1:21:30] sovereignty in our lives amen you know
[1:21:33] his Sovereign will and say use me when
[1:21:36] you you know when and where and how you
[1:21:39] want to use me Lord you know are you are
[1:21:41] you willing to surrender yourself in
[1:21:43] that way amen you know God's looking for
[1:21:45] for us to to to build this ministry to
[1:21:48] move it forward for his glory to reach
[1:21:51] the lost you know know to to to reach
[1:21:54] those last few wherever they are I
[1:21:56] believe God is you know moving us into a
[1:21:59] public display of his word listen it's
[1:22:03] not a coincidence that Joseph is 30
[1:22:06] years old when he actually gets placed
[1:22:10] next to
[1:22:11] Pharaoh he was 17 years old when he got
[1:22:14] sold into Egypt and it wasn't until 13
[1:22:17] years later that he is sitting at the
[1:22:20] right hand of pharaoh it's not a
[1:22:23] coincidence it was is it was God's
[1:22:26] perfect timing do you know that Jesus
[1:22:28] Christ public Ministry started when he
[1:22:31] was 30 do you know that Jesus Christ was
[1:22:35] sold by his
[1:22:37] brothers for 30 pieces of silver do you
[1:22:40] know Joseph was sold by his brothers for
[1:22:44] 20 pieces of silver you know I was I was
[1:22:47] looking you know sometimes you see
[1:22:49] certain things and you know when when I
[1:22:51] was studying and I came across
[1:22:53] this little thing on on you know
[1:22:54] Joseph's life and Joseph's timing and
[1:22:57] how God's timing is perfect and how God
[1:23:00] typed everything in Joseph right but
[1:23:03] then the one thing that didn't match was
[1:23:05] 20 pieces of silver for Joseph and 30
[1:23:09] pieces of silver for Jesus Christ and
[1:23:12] this individual you know he just brought
[1:23:14] it out and he's he's he's looking at all
[1:23:16] the timing he says and listen you got to
[1:23:19] take everything with a grain of salt but
[1:23:20] some things they kind of Step you know
[1:23:23] out of the out of the page right when
[1:23:24] you're reading it and he says he
[1:23:27] believes that Jesus Christ is going to
[1:23:29] come in
[1:23:31] [Laughter]
[1:23:34] 2030 and I said you know that's pretty
[1:23:37] good that's pretty good you know and
[1:23:39] then all the timelines and and and the
[1:23:41] 2,000 years and Jesus Christ you know
[1:23:45] ad30 right well you take 2,000 years
[1:23:48] from ad30 and where do you end up 2030
[1:23:52] listen I'm not saying that he's wrong
[1:23:55] I'm not putting my life on it I'm not
[1:23:58] going to say that's what it is praise
[1:24:00] God hallelujah no I'm not saying that
[1:24:03] okay but I am saying that we're really
[1:24:06] close to some significant events the
[1:24:09] thing that they haven't recognized is
[1:24:11] that Jesus Christ is already
[1:24:14] here we're not looking for his coming we
[1:24:18] have recognized that he's already here
[1:24:20] amen we are those that are looking
[1:24:22] looking for our going we're looking for
[1:24:25] the Rapture we're looking for the
[1:24:27] quickening power which is Jesus Christ
[1:24:30] in us right now that's quicking
[1:24:33] quickening us by his word to take a
[1:24:36] dimensional change to go for that
[1:24:38] meeting in the air you see Jesus Christ
[1:24:42] has already come he's here in the midst
[1:24:45] of of the people just in the same way
[1:24:48] that they could not recognize Jesus
[1:24:50] Christ when he was on Earth he's the
[1:24:52] same yesterday today and forever brother
[1:24:54] Phillip they're not going to recognize
[1:24:56] him when he's here that's why when you
[1:24:58] tell them about the word when you tell
[1:25:01] them look at the scripture that's the
[1:25:03] spirit of God in you speaking going back
[1:25:06] to the word just like Jesus when he
[1:25:08] stood there and he opened the Scrolls
[1:25:10] and he said this day this scripture in
[1:25:13] Isaiah has been fulfilled they couldn't
[1:25:16] they what what are you talking about
[1:25:18] right away they wanted to crucify and
[1:25:20] blasphemy he's making himself God now
[1:25:23] listen we're not making ourselves God
[1:25:25] but God said on that day ye shall know
[1:25:27] that I am in the father ye in me and I
[1:25:29] in
[1:25:31] you that's what he said and so if we
[1:25:34] believe that then we recognize we know
[1:25:37] and we we we we we we see that the
[1:25:39] spirit of God is actually living within
[1:25:42] us amen praise God and this is something
[1:25:45] that they just cannot comprehend no they
[1:25:49] don't realize Jesus Christ is here now
[1:25:52] now preparing a people calling one here
[1:25:56] snatching one there this one but how is
[1:25:59] it that that he's doing it by divine
[1:26:01] revelation there's no other way that
[1:26:04] you're going to come to Christ you you
[1:26:06] can't be a part of God's Church Christ
[1:26:08] Church unless you come by the spiritual
[1:26:12] Revelation which is the rock that he
[1:26:14] said he would build his church not on
[1:26:16] Peter Peter could not possibly have been
[1:26:19] the rock that the church was built upon
[1:26:22] no even though the word Peter means rock
[1:26:25] that doesn't Peter he denied Jesus
[1:26:28] Christ after that three times and cursed
[1:26:32] imagine and God's going to build his
[1:26:35] church upon a person no sir he's he
[1:26:39] didn't even build it upon
[1:26:41] himself he built it upon divine
[1:26:44] revelation that he would reveal to you
[1:26:47] that you are a part of him that you are
[1:26:49] an Express attribute that was in God
[1:26:52] from before the foundations of the world
[1:26:55] and that you went into a spiritual
[1:26:56] Amnesia and you needed to come out of
[1:26:58] that Amnesia by the by the hearing of
[1:27:00] the word of God in your day and in your
[1:27:02] hour God has a timing for all things
[1:27:07] amen glory to God and we know God's
[1:27:09] timing is
[1:27:12] perfect and so we know here as we go on
[1:27:17] and we read the
[1:27:18] scripture Joseph was placed into pontier
[1:27:21] house
[1:27:23] and the scripture says you'll read it
[1:27:25] when you go and take some time to read
[1:27:27] it that pontier did not have to worry
[1:27:31] about absolutely anything he placed
[1:27:35] everything into Joseph's hands to the
[1:27:38] point where the the scripture says that
[1:27:40] all he had to worry about was what he
[1:27:44] ate imagine that imagine that you know
[1:27:49] here pontier had the spirit of God God
[1:27:52] in an individual living in his house and
[1:27:55] his house prospered I want you to know
[1:27:58] something everything that God has typed
[1:28:01] in
[1:28:02] Joseph was in Christ and everything that
[1:28:05] was in Christ he poured into the church
[1:28:09] he's poured that Prosperity into your
[1:28:12] life everything that you once you come
[1:28:15] under that Divine understanding that
[1:28:17] Revelation that you are in Christ Jesus
[1:28:21] you you are you are now you are now uh
[1:28:25] subject to all that God poured into
[1:28:28] Christ is now poured to you all the
[1:28:32] prosperity all the things that you would
[1:28:35] that you would pray for all that you
[1:28:37] would touch now now this is you got to
[1:28:39] take this into the proper context
[1:28:41] because you need to understand who you
[1:28:44] really are you're not making we're not
[1:28:47] better than anybody it's Christ in us
[1:28:50] that gives us this this this Spirit of
[1:28:53] prosperity around our lives we need to
[1:28:56] understand that it's Christ it's not you
[1:28:58] it's not me but it's you believing that
[1:29:00] it is Christ in you and that's what
[1:29:04] brings that that all those spiritual
[1:29:06] blessings into your life and here Joseph
[1:29:11] he knew that God was was was absolutely
[1:29:15] sovereignly in control of his life and
[1:29:17] here comes pontier wife to tempt him
[1:29:21] like you like you know like how Satan
[1:29:22] tempts all men yeah right he'll tempt
[1:29:26] you know you got to watch it young men
[1:29:27] and you young ladies too you know the
[1:29:29] enemy is going to test you to see if you
[1:29:32] know if if you know because maybe you
[1:29:35] you find an opportunity where where it
[1:29:37] can happen you got to watch Satan will
[1:29:39] try to set you up the the scripture said
[1:29:42] that all the servants were not in the
[1:29:44] house at that time why because Satan was
[1:29:46] setting Joseph up but God was allowing
[1:29:50] the
[1:29:50] setup God God knew that there was going
[1:29:52] to be a setup God knew that Joseph would
[1:29:55] be able to stand against the temptation
[1:29:58] but the enemy is a liar God is going to
[1:30:00] put lies on your life uh Satan is going
[1:30:03] to put God lies on your life Satan is
[1:30:06] going to tell people that you're this
[1:30:08] you're that and and that you're a
[1:30:11] fanatic amen he's going to try to make
[1:30:13] you you know uh something different and
[1:30:16] you know oh well he's a fanatic about
[1:30:18] Jesus I'm a fanatic about Jesus yes I am
[1:30:22] why because he's the one and only true
[1:30:24] Living God amen amen if I'm going to put
[1:30:26] my trust in something I'm going to put
[1:30:28] it in the absolute and Jesus Christ is
[1:30:31] the absolute praise God but Joseph he
[1:30:35] had something in him he had the spirit
[1:30:38] of God even pontier noticed that that
[1:30:42] Joseph had the spirit of God in his life
[1:30:45] and and and Joseph being tested the way
[1:30:48] that he was tested she tried to pull him
[1:30:50] to sleep with him and he said and I want
[1:30:53] you to notice what he said when you go
[1:30:55] back and you read this you're going to
[1:30:56] get a lot more I'm just laying in some
[1:30:59] of the thoughts that God you know
[1:31:00] blessed me with as I was studying all
[1:31:02] this he said he said can I sin against
[1:31:08] God he knew that his
[1:31:11] his his master had given him all the
[1:31:14] authority he says he's given me
[1:31:16] everything all rule over the house and
[1:31:18] everything else except he has not given
[1:31:20] me you he's telling uh you know uh
[1:31:23] Piper's wife he never gave me you he
[1:31:26] gave me everything else but he never
[1:31:27] gave me you and how can I sin against
[1:31:31] God not against pontier against God
[1:31:35] because he had a reality of God in his
[1:31:37] life and when you come into situations
[1:31:40] and trials and Temptations I want you to
[1:31:43] know that it's it's it's your
[1:31:45] relationship with God that's going to
[1:31:47] surface when the time comes that the
[1:31:50] Temptation tries to take you you thank
[1:31:52] you hallelujah praise
[1:31:57] God so all of these things God was
[1:32:00] showing the character of
[1:32:02] Joseph praise the Lord Jesus amen
[1:32:08] hallelujah let's go to the
[1:32:15] next now we're going to look at so that
[1:32:17] was looking at Joseph's faithfulness
[1:32:19] what we just looked at there we just
[1:32:21] touching on certain areas of his life
[1:32:24] certain aspects of his character amen so
[1:32:28] the next uh slide is the next scripture
[1:32:30] from Genesis
[1:32:32] 41:15
[1:32:33] to6 and we want to notice that also
[1:32:37] before we go to this just go back to the
[1:32:39] other scripture or not not the scripture
[1:32:41] but the the Joseph's
[1:32:43] faithfulness I want I want you to know
[1:32:46] that that Temptation that Joseph faced
[1:32:49] he was falsely accused by Piper's wife
[1:32:53] and he was placed in prison for
[1:32:57] something that he never did but while he
[1:33:00] was in prison God didn't change Joseph's
[1:33:05] attitude I want you to notice that his
[1:33:08] same attitude that while he was under
[1:33:10] pontier that same attitude went with him
[1:33:14] into the
[1:33:15] jail he was still
[1:33:19] faithful he was still willing to do all
[1:33:24] that would please God not please
[1:33:27] man amen and this is a lesson that we
[1:33:30] need to draw from this from this uh you
[1:33:33] know uh thought here is that Joseph
[1:33:35] never bowed down he stayed faithful to
[1:33:39] his calling his election his placing all
[1:33:43] that God had done for him he realized
[1:33:45] that God had taken him out of the pit
[1:33:48] God had placed him and give him favor in
[1:33:50] pontier house he realized that this was
[1:33:53] just another setup another another
[1:33:55] display of God wanting to come on the
[1:33:58] scene because God had a plan for Joseph
[1:34:01] and while he was in prison you know the
[1:34:03] story I'm not going to go through all of
[1:34:05] it but while he was in
[1:34:07] prison we realized that um that there
[1:34:11] was a couple of Servants of pharaoh that
[1:34:14] were thrown into the prison and one was
[1:34:17] the Baker and the other one was the was
[1:34:18] the cup Bearer and Joseph was able to
[1:34:22] interpret their Dreams by the spirit of
[1:34:25] God it wasn't by his own ability you see
[1:34:28] God has given us the spirit of
[1:34:30] revelation God has given us certain
[1:34:33] aspects of our personal walk with him
[1:34:36] that that gives us uh blessings for
[1:34:39] those that we know it pours out
[1:34:41] blessings into our family it it blesses
[1:34:44] the places that we work you know that
[1:34:47] you can't help but be a blessing
[1:34:49] wherever God places you if if you've got
[1:34:52] the right attitude where God has placed
[1:34:54] you you will be a blessing there and
[1:34:56] they will know that you are a blessing
[1:34:58] but if you're the kind of person like
[1:35:00] the rest of the world where they get a
[1:35:01] job yeah well it's a job well it's a job
[1:35:05] you know I'll do only what I got to do
[1:35:08] and then man when that 4:00 Buzzard goes
[1:35:10] off boom right to the door right to the
[1:35:13] time clock I'm out of here you know that
[1:35:16] is not the kind of attitude that exists
[1:35:21] in Sons and Daughters of
[1:35:23] God I want you to see things here I want
[1:35:25] you to identify yourself in the areas I
[1:35:28] want you to surrender in certain areas
[1:35:31] where you feel like maybe I'm being a
[1:35:32] little selfish in these areas you know I
[1:35:34] need to I need to live more for others I
[1:35:38] need to allow my life to be a display
[1:35:40] that can help others not just myself
[1:35:44] amen and so while Joseph was was in
[1:35:47] prison he didn't have the attitude oh
[1:35:49] man I'm stuck here he didn't join
[1:35:51] himself with all those that were that
[1:35:54] were like the the the rebels and you
[1:35:56] know all the ones that um that were
[1:35:58] rebelling and wanted to fight all the
[1:36:00] time no Joseph he actually gained the
[1:36:03] favor of the head
[1:36:05] Jailer and all of a sudden he was
[1:36:07] running the jail within two years he was
[1:36:12] he was in there and he was he was
[1:36:13] running the
[1:36:15] show you know and yet here now a couple
[1:36:19] of individuals get thrown into jail
[1:36:22] Joseph identifies their dreams tells one
[1:36:25] that you're going to be restored tells
[1:36:26] the other one that your head's going to
[1:36:28] be
[1:36:28] removed and and from that event it
[1:36:32] wasn't
[1:36:34] until years later a couple years later
[1:36:37] that all of a sudden Pharaoh now has a
[1:36:41] dream and here now Joseph is still
[1:36:46] living the way that he was when he was
[1:36:48] living with pontier he was still loyal
[1:36:51] he he was still he had no attitude he
[1:36:54] was he was the one that was running the
[1:36:56] jail now go to the next
[1:36:59] scripture Genesis 41:15 to16 and Pharaoh
[1:37:03] said unto Joseph I have dreamed a dream
[1:37:06] and there is none that can interpret it
[1:37:09] and I have heard say of thee that thou
[1:37:11] can't understand a dream to interpret it
[1:37:15] and Joseph answered Pharaoh saying it is
[1:37:18] not me God shall give pharaoh
[1:37:21] an answer of Peace you know Joseph could
[1:37:25] have looked at this opportunity and seen
[1:37:28] man you know what I'm gonna I'm going to
[1:37:32] go to pharaoh and I'm G to make him
[1:37:34] think that I am the most spiritual
[1:37:37] individual that he's ever
[1:37:39] met you know you know sometimes listen
[1:37:43] God's giving you revelation of this
[1:37:44] message you want to know how you can
[1:37:47] help others and bring others to
[1:37:50] Christ humble
[1:37:53] yourself humble yourself Joseph was
[1:37:56] showing humility in his character he
[1:37:59] didn't turn around and tell Pharaoh I
[1:38:01] know I can interpret your dream no he
[1:38:04] made it very clear that God was with him
[1:38:07] that God started a work in my life and
[1:38:10] God's going to finish this work in my
[1:38:12] life I don't know how it is that he
[1:38:14] gives me all this wisdom and
[1:38:16] understanding and organizational skills
[1:38:18] and ability to do the things that I do
[1:38:20] but God has given me those things and
[1:38:23] and God is going to use them for his
[1:38:25] glory not for my not to raise me up not
[1:38:28] to do anything good for me he says I
[1:38:30] don't it's not in me he says but God
[1:38:33] will give you the interpretation amen
[1:38:36] praise God
[1:38:39] hallelujah he was showing a prime
[1:38:42] example of faithfulness to God during
[1:38:46] his entire life and during this
[1:38:48] particular experience and and then here
[1:38:51] he goes and he interprets everything for
[1:38:57] the
[1:38:57] Pharaoh and then he tells the Pharaoh
[1:39:00] after giving them the interpretation of
[1:39:02] his dreams and if you want to go back
[1:39:03] and read all about it it's really a
[1:39:05] blessing go back and read all the whole
[1:39:08] story again the inter you know after
[1:39:11] after this service here and hearing what
[1:39:12] you've heard you're going to see Joseph
[1:39:14] and yourself and your experiences and
[1:39:17] how God is working all these things out
[1:39:19] in your life and here he was showing his
[1:39:23] dream he told him seven years of famine
[1:39:26] or seven years of plenty seven years of
[1:39:28] famine and then he tells Pharaoh he says
[1:39:30] now you're going to need to appoint
[1:39:32] somebody you're going to need to find
[1:39:35] somebody that's got the wisdom in order
[1:39:37] to control all the Garners to put away a
[1:39:41] a a a percentage he told them 20% he
[1:39:43] knew exactly what needed to be done
[1:39:46] because God had given him the wisdom
[1:39:48] because God had a plan in his life you
[1:39:50] know know God places gifts in the church
[1:39:53] amen God places those gifts so that they
[1:39:55] can come to the surface naturally
[1:39:58] organically by the power of God by the
[1:40:01] leadership of the Holy Spirit God moves
[1:40:04] in Supernatural ways and he can place
[1:40:07] you exactly where he wants you to be and
[1:40:10] he'll start to use that gift in you
[1:40:13] because you have become humble enough to
[1:40:15] know that it's God's gift it's not your
[1:40:19] gift it's the people gift it's not the
[1:40:22] preacher's
[1:40:23] gift it's all the grace of God and with
[1:40:27] that in mind God knowing that his body
[1:40:30] is going to come together he knows every
[1:40:32] part that needs to get into its position
[1:40:35] he knows those that he needs to still
[1:40:37] shape their character shape their
[1:40:39] attitudes shape their pride remove that
[1:40:43] Pride humble them and get them to a
[1:40:45] place where they are totally surrendered
[1:40:48] unto him totally surrendered unto to him
[1:40:51] praise God and when when we get to that
[1:40:54] place like Joseph he got so yielded and
[1:40:56] so surrendered that God was giving him
[1:40:58] wisdom and understanding and leadership
[1:41:01] ability to do things that no man imagine
[1:41:04] the Pharaoh was like God on Earth he was
[1:41:08] like God on Earth and yet Joseph goes
[1:41:10] there interprets everything tells him
[1:41:12] what he needs to do Pharaoh sitting back
[1:41:15] there listening to him and saying wait a
[1:41:17] minute
[1:41:18] here is there anyone that could possibly
[1:41:22] be better than this individual right
[1:41:24] here and all his servants around said no
[1:41:28] no he's the man he's the one he's he's
[1:41:31] the one God was showing God was
[1:41:34] displaying that Joseph was being
[1:41:36] prepared to go and sit at the right hand
[1:41:40] of
[1:41:42] pharaoh
[1:41:43] hallelujah what kind of lessons do we
[1:41:46] learn from this
[1:41:49] humility when Pharaoh says says I hear
[1:41:51] you can interpret dreams it would have
[1:41:53] been easy for Joseph to say here's here
[1:41:55] it is in my notes it's nothing really
[1:41:58] just a little hobby I've developed over
[1:42:00] the years he could have said
[1:42:03] that but instead Joseph boldly says to
[1:42:06] this Pagan
[1:42:08] King it's not me God will give you an
[1:42:13] answer he was being bold you know
[1:42:15] Pharaoh could have turned around and
[1:42:16] said God what do you mean God I am God
[1:42:21] on Earth
[1:42:23] yeah but he was so troubled you see God
[1:42:26] works on both ends when God wants to
[1:42:30] Humble somebody let me tell you you get
[1:42:33] puffed up before God God will bring you
[1:42:35] right back down to the Earth just as
[1:42:38] quick as you puff yourself up he'll blow
[1:42:40] it right out of you hallelujah praise
[1:42:43] God but Pharaoh was humble enough to say
[1:42:48] no but instead Joseph boldly tells him
[1:42:51] this Joseph was clear on the source of
[1:42:55] his success and how it was that he could
[1:42:57] interpret dreams he he he took it and
[1:43:00] showed that it was all God he didn't let
[1:43:03] the Splendor of pharaoh in his Palace
[1:43:05] make him forget without God I'm nothing
[1:43:08] that's what he realized and until we get
[1:43:10] to a place to realize that without God
[1:43:13] in our lives without the spirit of God
[1:43:15] leading us directing us guiding us we're
[1:43:18] nothing amen we're going to fall into
[1:43:20] the traps of the enemy the enemy is
[1:43:22] going to trap you young people one way
[1:43:24] or the other is going to snare you with
[1:43:26] one Slicker and he's going to talk real
[1:43:28] sweet and cute to you and he's going to
[1:43:30] pull you away from God don't you let
[1:43:33] that happen don't you let the spirit of
[1:43:36] God uh in you uh keep it keep it keep it
[1:43:41] in the Forefront of your heart amen
[1:43:43] praise God Joseph without God I'm
[1:43:46] nothing he his source and his ability
[1:43:48] was all based on God amen hallelujah
[1:43:52] praise God Joseph he could have been you
[1:43:56] know he could have been like so angry
[1:43:59] listen some of the lessons that we learn
[1:44:01] here as we're winding down here
[1:44:03] faithfulness Joseph was a prime example
[1:44:06] of faithfulness during his his entire
[1:44:08] life he suffered a lot was sold into
[1:44:11] slavery he would have been easy to react
[1:44:14] in Anger to grow bitter lazy without
[1:44:16] caring about the world around him but
[1:44:18] Joseph didn't do that whatever t Joseph
[1:44:21] got God gave to him he did it with a
[1:44:24] whole heart everywhere he went success
[1:44:26] followed I'm telling you that if you
[1:44:29] from today you say I'm GNA serve God I'm
[1:44:32] going to serve God at work I'm going to
[1:44:33] serve God wherever I go I'm not talking
[1:44:35] about getting all religious on people
[1:44:38] I'm just talking about that internal
[1:44:40] Integrity you and God knowing being
[1:44:43] conscious of God Amen he was faithful to
[1:44:46] his master in in Piper's house and he
[1:44:49] was faithful to his master in the the
[1:44:50] prison Hallelujah he he was he was he
[1:44:54] was resistant to Temptation because of
[1:44:56] the spirit of God that was in him you
[1:44:58] stay in the word feed on the word
[1:45:00] assemble yourself whenever you possibly
[1:45:02] can that fortifies you with with the
[1:45:05] spirit of God around your life amen
[1:45:07] glory to God he was tempted day after
[1:45:10] day by that woman yet he held firm
[1:45:13] because he realized that he would be
[1:45:15] sinning against
[1:45:17] God hallelujah are you conscious of God
[1:45:20] every day in your life abolutely praise
[1:45:23] God Amen Hallelujah he chose
[1:45:25] relationship with God over relationship
[1:45:29] with the
[1:45:29] world Amen praise God it was showing
[1:45:33] God's sovereignty Joseph's life is also
[1:45:36] a great example of the sovereignty of
[1:45:38] God Amen praise God hallelujah seeming
[1:45:42] number listen he had so many disasters
[1:45:45] take place around him but he turned it
[1:45:47] all for good God turned everything for
[1:45:50] good am amen praise God he wasn't one he
[1:45:53] showed forgiveness Joseph was treated
[1:45:55] worse by his own family than any of us
[1:45:59] have almost surely ever been
[1:46:02] treated to the point where go you know
[1:46:05] your own family wants to kill
[1:46:08] you he faced some of the greatest
[1:46:11] challenges but he held to the word of
[1:46:13] God Amen he didn't hold any Grudge you
[1:46:16] know I was reading something this
[1:46:18] week you know he he didn't he didn't
[1:46:21] hold Grudge you know Joseph could have
[1:46:23] dealt with his brothers and dealt with
[1:46:26] them in such a way that when when when
[1:46:28] they came to him for
[1:46:31] for grain he could have he could have
[1:46:34] got real nasty with them but inside of
[1:46:37] him there was something that would not
[1:46:40] hold a grudge it was because the spirit
[1:46:43] of God was on his life you know I read
[1:46:46] something this we this week and I got a
[1:46:47] little bit of a of a a smile out of it
[1:46:52] and it's about American soldiers who
[1:46:54] during the Korean War had rented a house
[1:46:57] and hired a Korean man to cook for them
[1:47:00] and we're talking about holding a
[1:47:02] grudge this guy had an unbelievably
[1:47:05] great spirit about him the Americans
[1:47:07] loved teasing him they nailed his shoes
[1:47:10] to the
[1:47:12] floor they put grease on the stove
[1:47:15] handles they balanced buckets of water
[1:47:18] over the door so when he would open the
[1:47:20] the
[1:47:21] door they were being so nasty to him but
[1:47:24] this Korean brushed it all off and kept
[1:47:27] working with a smile holding no grudges
[1:47:30] finally the Americans just ashamed of
[1:47:33] themselves and wanted him to know that
[1:47:35] they were going to stop all the
[1:47:37] practical jokes the Korean ask you mean
[1:47:40] no more nail
[1:47:42] shoe no more no more sticky
[1:47:46] handle no more you mean no more bucket
[1:47:49] on door
[1:47:51] no
[1:47:52] more okay then I spit no more in your
[1:47:56] soup you
[1:47:58] see it's one thing when you hold a
[1:48:02] grudge and it's another thing when you
[1:48:05] actually Let It Go amen he was letting
[1:48:09] go of The Grudge right
[1:48:11] [Laughter]
[1:48:14] there
[1:48:16] hallelujah praise God you know some of
[1:48:20] the things as we wind down here just a
[1:48:22] couple more minutes some of the things
[1:48:25] that we need to realize you know there's
[1:48:26] so much from Joseph's life I just want
[1:48:29] to read Genesis 50 no I won't go there
[1:48:33] yet hold on I want us to that's going to
[1:48:35] be how we're going to end right there on
[1:48:37] that
[1:48:38] scripture you know there's some things
[1:48:40] that we need to learn from from what
[1:48:42] we've read here today and some of the
[1:48:44] examples of Joseph's character and
[1:48:47] there's there's a few things there's
[1:48:48] five things here that I that I wrote
[1:48:50] down down and number one was releasing
[1:48:52] your grudges you know sometimes we go
[1:48:55] through things in life and we have
[1:48:57] certain experiences and you know people
[1:49:00] hurt us and that can
[1:49:02] happen but we need to be able to let go
[1:49:06] of those things it falls under the same
[1:49:08] category as
[1:49:10] forgiveness we need to be able to
[1:49:13] forgive and I mean really forgive let go
[1:49:17] understand that you know listen you'll
[1:49:20] go and read all of this and you will see
[1:49:23] that Joseph's brothers they actually
[1:49:25] repented they actually came to a place
[1:49:28] where they realized that what they had
[1:49:29] done was wrong they came to a place that
[1:49:32] they they they feared that God was now
[1:49:35] go you know having Vengeance on them for
[1:49:37] what they did for Joseph they came to
[1:49:39] that place and Joseph displayed
[1:49:42] perfectly the the the character of Jesus
[1:49:45] Christ and that he forgave no matter
[1:49:47] what the circumstance you could look
[1:49:49] back on situations you could have had
[1:49:52] some bad conversations with with a loved
[1:49:55] one or a brother or a sister and had
[1:49:57] some scars that are still sitting there
[1:50:00] and their kind of wounds that you're not
[1:50:02] allowing the Holy Spirit to to mend and
[1:50:05] to allow the bomb of Gilead to allow his
[1:50:08] love loving bomb to come in and and and
[1:50:11] take away that pain and that sorrow it
[1:50:15] requires true forgiveness Letting Go
[1:50:19] truly letting go of your past
[1:50:21] understanding that everything that was
[1:50:23] in your past that that brought about
[1:50:25] those circumstances they need to be left
[1:50:28] in the past so that you can move on and
[1:50:32] be everything that God wants you to be
[1:50:35] he's got a plan look at the plan he had
[1:50:36] for Joseph it was a plan for the
[1:50:39] Salvation of the then world just like
[1:50:43] Jesus Christ is the savior of this world
[1:50:46] he's the only savior that can save
[1:50:48] anybody from from from what's going to
[1:50:51] come down upon this Earth it's going
[1:50:53] into the Great Tribulation there's going
[1:50:55] to be a complete
[1:50:58] uh massive destruction that's going to
[1:51:02] take place upon the Earth there's going
[1:51:03] to be many survivors but those that are
[1:51:06] in Christ will not have to go through
[1:51:08] that and that's what he's here to do is
[1:51:11] to bring you into that Ark of Safety
[1:51:14] which is Jesus Christ amen but you need
[1:51:17] to be able to forgive and let go of
[1:51:19] those things the other thing you need to
[1:51:22] do is you need to check your attitude
[1:51:24] everywhere Joseph ended up even in the
[1:51:27] dreariness of prison for two years he
[1:51:30] simply made it better only a good
[1:51:32] attitude can can position
[1:51:36] you and
[1:51:38] you can position
[1:51:43] you
[1:51:47] sorry you cannot defeat a person who
[1:51:50] chooses to make the best of a bad
[1:51:54] situation why because they got the right
[1:51:57] attitude I love the ability of Ronald
[1:52:00] Reagan listen to
[1:52:01] this despite having a bullet lodged in
[1:52:04] his heart he brushed off the Secret
[1:52:06] Service agents stood up buttoned his
[1:52:09] jacket and then walked into the
[1:52:11] emergency room this actually happened
[1:52:14] during the medical procedure he he he
[1:52:17] looked to his wife and he said honey I
[1:52:19] forgot to
[1:52:23] and to the surgeon about to operate he
[1:52:25] says I hope you're a
[1:52:28] republican you see he had the right
[1:52:31] attitude and he came out of that surgery
[1:52:34] we're using that in showing as an
[1:52:36] example but attitude will ultimately
[1:52:40] affect your altitude in life and in the
[1:52:42] body of Christ amen glory to God you
[1:52:46] need to trust God Amen regardless he was
[1:52:49] always taking listen he has always uh uh
[1:52:54] been there though though Joseph had some
[1:52:57] serious disappointments Joseph had to
[1:52:59] trust when he was in the pit Joseph had
[1:53:02] to trust when he was sold into slavery
[1:53:05] Joseph had to trust when he was facing
[1:53:07] that Temptation with Piper's wife he had
[1:53:10] to trust when he was thrown into jail
[1:53:12] Hallelujah and he had to trust God when
[1:53:14] he went up before Pharaoh that God was
[1:53:17] going to give him what he had need of
[1:53:19] Amen to overcome and he needed to trust
[1:53:22] God and we need to trust God praise God
[1:53:25] we need to understand that God is truly
[1:53:29] good amen God is in control of
[1:53:33] everything Hallelujah God elevated
[1:53:36] Joseph from prisoner in the dungeon to
[1:53:38] prime minister of Egypt but in the
[1:53:41] process he had to go through some time
[1:53:44] and some crime and all kinds of stuff
[1:53:46] that he never
[1:53:48] committed Joseph learned first of all
[1:53:51] that whatever happened to him personally
[1:53:54] was part of a larger purpose in which
[1:53:56] God's plan was being
[1:53:58] revealed in that case he could not hold
[1:54:01] grudges against his brothers no matter
[1:54:03] how badly they had behaved true they
[1:54:06] must they must learn of their sin and
[1:54:09] confess it and this explains the lengthy
[1:54:11] way in which Joseph really repeals his
[1:54:13] himself to them and his brothers and his
[1:54:16] brothers actually they came to a place
[1:54:18] where they they realized that they had
[1:54:23] sinned secondly Joseph begins to learn
[1:54:26] the answer to the question how will the
[1:54:29] promise made to Abraham be fulfilled God
[1:54:32] made a promise to Abraham Jacob Abraham
[1:54:36] Isaac and Jacob and in Joseph and Joseph
[1:54:39] was catching revelation of how God's
[1:54:42] promises were going to be fulfilled
[1:54:44] through the promise that was given to
[1:54:46] his great grandfather Abraham he was
[1:54:49] coming into to a realization let's read
[1:54:51] the final scripture
[1:54:55] now Genesis 50 let the musicians
[1:54:59] come when Joseph's Brethren saw that
[1:55:02] their father was dead they said to
[1:55:05] Joseph will pre-venture hate us and will
[1:55:09] certainly requite us of all the evil
[1:55:12] which we did unto him and they sent a
[1:55:15] messenger unto Joseph saying thy father
[1:55:17] did command before he died saying
[1:55:20] so shall ye say unto Joseph forgive I
[1:55:23] pray thee now the trespass of thy
[1:55:26] Brethren and their sin for they did unto
[1:55:29] thee evil and now we pray thee forgive
[1:55:32] the trespass of the Servants of the god
[1:55:35] of thy father and Joseph wept when they
[1:55:38] spake unto him and his Brethren also
[1:55:41] went and fell down before his face and
[1:55:44] they said behold we be thy servants and
[1:55:48] Joseph said unto them fear not for I am
[1:55:51] in the place of God am I in the place of
[1:55:55] God he was saying he was telling them
[1:55:58] clearly but as for you you thought evil
[1:56:02] against me but God meant it unto good to
[1:56:05] bring to pass at is as it is this day to
[1:56:08] save much people
[1:56:12] alive God had a purpose in
[1:56:15] Joseph do you know that God has a
[1:56:18] purpose in you amen do you know that
[1:56:21] your part in the word of God may lead
[1:56:24] that last one into the body of Christ
[1:56:28] which will lead to the Fulfillment of
[1:56:31] the body being completed and and the
[1:56:34] body going in the Rapture and allowing
[1:56:37] the Salvation that is that has come to
[1:56:39] this world to be fulfilled Jesus Christ
[1:56:43] has a great plan it's a much bigger plan
[1:56:45] than than than your individual plan but
[1:56:48] God has made you a part of that plan God
[1:56:51] wants you to recognize that all the
[1:56:53] things that have come into your life all
[1:56:56] the things that have that have hurt you
[1:56:58] that have made and given you those bad
[1:57:00] experiences they were all for a a a a
[1:57:03] greater purpose much greater than even
[1:57:07] yourself but for the purpose that that
[1:57:10] Christ might fulfill his purpose in the
[1:57:13] Plan of Redemption because Jesus said
[1:57:15] all that the father hath given me will
[1:57:17] come not one is going to be left behind
[1:57:21] every single son and daughter of God no
[1:57:24] matter what condition no matter where
[1:57:26] they are no matter the circumstances God
[1:57:29] is going to reach into that individual's
[1:57:32] life and God is going to use you to do
[1:57:35] it that's why you've been called to this
[1:57:38] Revelation that's why you've been called
[1:57:40] to this word that's why we we we we we
